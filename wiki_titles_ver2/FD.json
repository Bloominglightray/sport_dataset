        "text": "Daniel Ortiz (born January 5, 1990) is a Puerto Rican professional baseball outfielder for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nCareer.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOrtiz was drafted in the fourth round (126th overall) by the Minnesota Twins in the 2008 MLB draft out of Benjamin Harrison High School in Cayey, Puerto Rico. After signing for $253,000, Ortiz reported to the GCL Twins where batted .274 with two home runs and 27 runs batted in over 48 games. Daniel was forced to miss the 2009 season after undergoing left knee surgery during the offseason. Ortiz did little to change that perception over the next two years, hitting .259 with 11 homers and 43 runs batted in over 62 games with the Elizabethton Twins in 2010 and .239 with 10 homers and 71 runs batted in the following year with the Low-A Beloit Snappers. For the 2012 season, Ortiz began the year back with the Snappers but quickly proved that he was a changed player, hitting .299 with 8 runs and 13 runs batted in through only 22 games and earning himself a spot on the midseason Midwest League all-star team. Ortiz started the month of May with the High-A Fort Myers Miracle. Over the rest of the season, Ortiz continued to hit for both average and power, finishing with a .269 batting average, eight home runs and 35 runs batted in. Ortiz was promoted again to begin the 2013 year, playing for the Double-A New Britain Rock Cats. Ortiz hit a career high 12 home runs to go along with a .258 batting average and 60 runs batted in. In 2014 Ortiz remained with the Rock Cats for 48 games, and he owned a .500 slugging percentage, a .325 batting average, and 31 runs batted in before an early June call up to the Rochester Red Wings. In 55 games since his promotion, Ortiz hit 7 home runs, drove in 29 runs, recorded a slugging percentage of .456, and owned a .257 batting average.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOrtiz signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on November 20, 2015. He spent the 2016 season in Triple-A with the Indianapolis Indians, batting .236/.275/.415 with 15 home runs and 61 RBI in 110 games. The Pirates promoted him to the major leagues on April 29, 2017. Ortiz appeared in 9 games for Pirates in 2017, notching 1 hit in 12-bats. On August 5, 2017, Ortiz was designated for assignment by the Pirates and sent him outright to Indianapolis on August 7. He elected free agency following the season on November 6.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOrtiz signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on January 3, 2018, with an invitation to spring training. He was assigned to AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs for the 2018 season, after which he became a free agent.\nPericos de Puebla.\nOn February 21, 2019, Ortiz signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League. In 2019, he was a mid-season All-Star. Ortiz did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the LMB season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2023, Ortiz played in 87 games, batting .270/.325/.485 with 16 home runs and 61 RBI. With Puebla, Ortiz won the Serie del Rey."

After a round of 66 (−6), which included eight birdies and an eagle to offset a double bogey at the 15th, Jason Day built a two-stroke lead after 54 holes. Day carried at least a share of the lead into the final round for the third consecutive major championship, the first since Phil Mickelson in 2006 to do so. Jordan Spieth birdied six out of his last eight holes for a bogey-free round of 65 (−7) to move into second place. Branden Grace had the low round of the day with a 64 (−8) and jumped from 28th at the start of the round to a tie for third.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 16, 2015\"\nJason Day set a major championship scoring record on the way to a three-stroke victory and his first career major. After a round of 67 (−5) he finished the tournament at 20-under-par, breaking the previous major scoring record set by Tiger Woods at the 2000 Open Championship. Jordan Spieth, looking to join Woods and Ben Hogan with three major victories in a year, began the final round two strokes behind but was never able to close that deficit, finishing three shots behind. Spieth finished the year 54-under-par at the majors, also surpassing Woods' record from 2000. Branden Grace and Justin Rose also got to within two shots of the lead but fell from contention after double bogeys at the 10th and 13th, respectively.\nFinal leaderboard.\n\"Note: Top 15 and ties qualify for the 2016 PGA Championship; top 4 and ties qualify for the 2016 Masters Tournament\"\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

As of October 17, 2016, about 70% of the construction work has been completed.\nIt is expected that once the stadium opens, cricket will become more popular in southern Afghanistan. The Kandahar International Cricket Stadium will be one of the leading cricket stadiums in Afghanistan after Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium in the Ghazi Amanullah Town of Jalalabad, and Alokozay Kabul International Cricket Ground in Kabul.\nIt is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan in Afghanistan who became full members of the ICC in 2017."

        "text": "The 2015 European Rugby Champions Cup Final was the final match in the first European Rugby Champions Cup, and the twentieth European club rugby final in general, as the competition replaces the Heineken Cup.\nThe final was played between the French clubs Clermont and Toulon at Twickenham Stadium on 2 May 2015.\nToulon won the final, beating Clermont by 24 points to 18.\nThis was the third successive win by Toulon of the top European club rugby competition.\nBackground.\nIn the Heineken Cup (1995–2014), Toulon won twice, the two last editions of the tournament (2013 and 2014). The first of those finals was also Clermont's only final, and Toulon won 16–15 at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland. In 2014, Toulon won 23–6 against England's Saracens at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.\nVenue and ticketing.\nFollowing a competitive tendering process, the tournament organisers, European Professional Club Rugby, announced in August 2014 that the final would be held in the 82,000 capacity Twickenham Stadium, London on 2 May 2015. The scheduling makes it the earliest in the season that the European final has been held since the 1999 Heineken Cup Final, and is two weeks after the semi-finals are held, providing limited opportunity for supporters of the two finalists to make arrangements to attend. Around 8000 supporters of the two clubs involved in the final travelled to Twickenham, with part of their allocations being returned.\nEfforts were made to try and boost attendance by offering free tickets to the final to those that purchased tickets to the Aviva Premiership final that was to be held in the same venue later in the month. However, a technical issue meant that the requirement to purchase the Premiership final tickets was not initially enforced, meaning customers could order only the free ticket and pay just a booking fee.\nRoute to Final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nClermont.\nIn the pool stages, third-seeds Clermont topped Pool 1, winning five of six games. Their only defeat was their first game, losing 30–23 away to Saracens at Allianz Park on 18 October 2014. After that, they defeated Munster and Sale Sharks home and away, and concluded on 15 January 2015 with an 18–6 victory over Saracens at the Stade Marcel-Michelin.\nOn 4 April in the quarter-finals, Clermont hosted English champions Northampton Saints and won 37–5. Fourteen days later in the semi-finals they hosted Saracens, who had defeated them in the previous season's Heineken Cup semi-finals, and won 13–9. Wesley Fofana scored the only try of the match for Clermont, converted by Brock James, who also scored both of their penalties.\nToulon.\nSeeded second, Toulon won Pool 3 with five victories and one defeat. Their one loss came away to Leicester Tigers on 7 December, 25–21. In the quarter-finals, they triumphed 32–18 over Wasps at the Stade Mayol on 5 April, with tries by Mathieu Bastareaud and Ali Williams. Both were converted by Frédéric Michalak, who also scored all six of their penalties. Two weeks later they won their semi-final 25–20 after extra time against Leinster at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille. The game finished 12–12 after 80 minutes, and in extra time both teams scored tries: Bryan Habana's for Toulon was converted by Leigh Halfpenny, but Séan O'Brien scored a late try for Leinster."

        "text": "Kevin Romone White Jr. (born June 25, 1992) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent. He played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers, earning first-team All-American honors in 2014.\nA highly-rated prospect coming out of college, White was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the first round of the 2015 NFL draft with the seventh overall selection. His first three seasons with the Bears were injury plagued, and he was released by the Bears following the 2018 season. He has since been a member of the Arizona Cardinals (2019), San Francisco 49ers (2020), and New Orleans Saints (2021–2022).\nEarly years.\nHe was born Kevin Romone White Jr. on June 25, 1992. White played high school football at Emmaus High School in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, which competes in the East Penn Conference.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating high school, he attended Lackawanna College for two seasons before attending West Virginia University. In his first season at West Virginia in 2013, he started nine of 11 games and had 35 receptions for 507 yards and five touchdowns. White returned his senior season in 2014 as a starter. He finished the season with 109 receptions for 1,447 yards and 10 touchdowns. He was named an All-American by numerous publications and was a finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nWhite was considered one of the two best wide receivers of the 2015 class, together with Amari Cooper.\nChicago Bears.\nHe was drafted by the Chicago Bears with the seventh overall draft pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. On May 6, 2015, White signed a four-year, $15 million contract with the team.\nWhile participating in the Bears off-season program, White received a minor injury to his shin that held him out of several training camp practices. Shortly after returning, Bears general manager Ryan Pace announced on August 15, 2015, that White had suffered a stress fracture in his shin while participating in organized team activities that would require surgery. On August 23, 2015, White had a steel rod inserted into his left tibia and was placed on the Bears physically unable to perform (PUP) list. White did not play a single game during his rookie season of 2015.\nAfter playing the first four games in the 2016 season, it was announced on October 5, 2016, that White had fractured the fibula in his left leg, the same leg he had injured the year before, and that he has been placed on injured reserve.\nWhite was a starter in the Bears' 2017 season-opener against the Atlanta Falcons. However, he fractured his left shoulder blade in the game. He recorded only two receptions for six yards during the game. White was placed on injured reserve for the third straight year on September 10, 2017.\nOn May 2, 2018, the Bears declined White's fifth-year option. On October 21, 2018, with the Bears trailing the New England Patriots 38–31 late in the game, White caught a 54-yard Hail Mary pass from quarterback Mitchell Trubisky as time expired. However, he was stopped one yard short, ensuring a Bears loss.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn March 15, 2019, White signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals, but was released on August 21, 2019. After sitting out the 2019 NFL season, White had a tryout with the New York Jets on August 20, 2020.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nWhite signed with the San Francisco 49ers on August 27, 2020. He was released on September 5, 2020, and signed to the practice squad the next day. He was elevated to the active roster for the team's weeks 5, 6, and 9 games against the Miami Dolphins, Los Angeles Rams, and Green Bay Packers, and reverted to the practice squad after each game. He was placed on the practice squad/COVID-19 list by the team on December 22, 2020, and restored to the practice squad on December 31. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 4, 2021. He was released by the 49ers on August 11, 2021.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nWhite signed with the New Orleans Saints on August 17, 2021. He was released on August 31, 2021, and re-signed to the practice squad. On October 31, 2021, White made his first reception in three years, for 38 yards against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from quarterback Trevor Siemian. The Saints went on to win 36-27. He was signed to the active roster on November 13 and released a week later, on November 20. He was again resigned three days later, but released on November 30 and reassigned to the practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Saints on January 12, 2022.\nOn August 23, 2022, White was placed on injured reserve. He was released four days later, on August 27. He was re-signed to the practice squad on October 5. White was activated from the practice squad and made his 2022 debut for the Saints on October 20, where he recorded a career-long 64-yard reception in a 42–34 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He was signed to the active roster on November 7, 2022. He was released on December 5, 2022. He was signed back to the practice squad on December 7, 2022. His practice squad contract with the team expired after the season on January 8, 2023.\nPersonal life.\nWhite has two younger brothers, Ka'Raun and Kyzir, who both played football at West Virginia. Kyzir is a linebacker who was drafted in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Chargers, where he played for three years before joining then Philadelphia Eagles's 2022 Super Bowl team, and presently playing with the Arizona Cardinals."

        "text": "The Three Nations Senior Lacrosse League (TNSLL) is a Senior B box lacrosse league based out of Ontario, Quebec and New York, sanctioned by the First Nations Lacrosse Association (FNLA). The league champion earns a spot in the Presidents Cup, the national championship of Senior B lacrosse in Canada.\nHistory.\n2009.\nAkwesasne Thunderbirds, Cornwall Island Redmen and Massena Muskies played an inter-league schedule with the Quebec Senior Lacrosse League (QSLL). Cornwall swept Akwesasne in three-straight games (7-5; 16-6; 11-10) in the opening round before being swept in the finals (9-7; 14-4; 9-5) by Massena.\n2010.\nSnake Island Muskies (formerly Massena) swept their opening round playoff series (20-2; 22-6; 17-13) to meet the Redmen in the finals. Cornwall Island won in three-straight games (9-5; 6-5; 10-3).\n2011.\nThe league grew to four teams with the addition of Caughnawaga Indians (previously competed in Circuit Québécois de Crosse) and St. Regis Braves.\nThe Muskies got some revenge from the previous seasons by knocking out the Redmen four-games-to-two (5-13; 9-8; 13-7; 8-4; 9-10; 13-7). In the finals Snake Island upset top seed St. Regis in five games (9-5; 11-13; 8-7; 8-12; 8-7). Both teams would advance to the Presidents Cup with the Braves playing host in Akwesasne.\nIn the round robin St. Regis Braves went a perfect 6-0 while the Muskies 4-2-1 record was second-best. The Braves defeated Snake Island 11-8 in the gold medal game.\n2012.\nSt. Regis swept the Redmen in four games (16-11; 15-8; 20-7; forfeit) in the league finals. The Braves would go on to win their second-straight Presidents Cup.\n2013.\nThree teams made up the TNSLL (St. Regis Braves went on hiatus). Snake Island Muskies were the top seed in the Wally Roundpoint Memorial Cup playoffs. They would face the Caughnawaga Indians, who they narrowly topped for the top spot, in a best-of seven finals as the Indians eliminated the Redmen (17-8; 12-10; 9-8). A four games-to-one series (6-11; 12-10; 15-11; 11-10; 8-6) win earned Caughnawaga Indians a spot in the Presidents Cup.\nNotable players from the champion Caughnawaga Indians included the Thompson brothers (Jeremy, Jerome, Miles and Lyle) cousin Ty Thompson. Miles and Lyle went on to be named co-winners of the 2014 Tewaraaton Award after their season with the University at Albany.\n2014.\nThe regular season included an 18-game schedule, each team playing the other six times. Snake Island Muskies (14-4) won the regular season, finishing just ahead of second place Akwesasne Outlawz (13-5). Caughnawaga Indians (7-11) and Tyendinaga Wolfpack (2-16) finished well behind the top two.\nSnake Island easily got past the Wolpack (23-12; 20-7; forfeit) while the Muskies eliminated Caughnawaga (29-4; 20-5; forfeit). The best-of five championship series was won by Akwesasne after a thrilling four-games (8-9, 9-8, 13-9, 10-7) with Snake Island.\n2015.\nWith the Akwesasne and Caughnawaga both on hiatus, Snake Island Muskies (9-7) and Tyendinaga Wolfpack (0-6) played an inter-league schedule against QSLL teams. The TNSLL championship was contested in a one-game playoff on August 8 at Deseronto Community Recreation Centre, won by the Muskies 21-9.\n2016.\nTwo teams (Caughnawaga Indians, St. Regis Braves) returned while three-time champion Snake Island Muskies went on hiatus. Tyendinaga changed their name from Wolfpack to Thunderbirds.\nTyendinaga eliminated Caughnawaga in three straight to earn a spot in the finals. The Thunderbirds went on to upset St. Regis in the finals to earn their first-ever berth to Presidents Cup.\n2023.\nTNSLL saw growth for the 2023 season with the Akwesasne Bucks (formerly of Can-Am Lacrosse) and Capital Region Axemen (Quebec Senior Lacrosse League) switching leagues. Cornwall Island Redmen also returned after a 10-year hiatus."

        "text": "Notts Golf Club, more commonly referred to simply as Hollinwell, is an 18-hole members golf club in Nottinghamshire, England which has hosted a number of leading amateur and professional competitions. The course has widely been reviewed as one of the top 50 courses in England and the British Isles.\nName.\nThe name Hollinwell reportedly relates to the presence of a holy well in trees close to the 8th fairway, and is the more-commonly used name for the golf course itself. However the members belong to the Notts Golf Club and Hollinwell is the name of the course on which the club plays. In concession to this, the two names are usually both used when formally referring to the club giving rise to the name Notts Golf Club (Hollinwell).\nHistory.\nNotts Golf Club was initially founded as the Nottingham Golf Club in 1887 and started on a 5-hole course using a recreation ground under the permission of the local council. This was soon found to be inadequate and during the same year the club moved to Bulwell Forest, where a seven-hole course was established.\nIn 1891 Notts Ladies' Golf Club was established playing on the same ground at Bulwell Forest, whilst these two clubs have remained together ever since they still remain separate clubs to this date.\nThe club moved to its current location at Hollinwell in 1901. The course was initially designed by Willie Park, Jr. on an area of land leased to the golf club. This land was subsequently purchased by the golf club in 1924. Some changes regarding the bunkering were made by J.H. Taylor in 1902, however the largest changes happened following an extension to the course by Tom Williamson in 1912. The layout designed in 1912 has remained largely unchanged to date, however the course has been significantly lengthened to remain a competitive challenge in modern golf.\nSince its inception the course has been host to a number of top amateur and professional competitions.\nCourse and scorecard.\nThere is a single 18-hole course at Hollinwell which takes the form of a heathland course, from the championship tees the course measures 7,250 yards.\n \n \nAll distances given in yards\nTournaments hosted.\nBrabazon Trophy.\nThe club has hosted the English Men's Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship for the Brabazon Trophy on 4 occasions. The club first hosted the competition in 1959 when Doug Sewell of England won with a total score of 287. The club hosted the competition for the second time in 1975 when Sandy Lyle prevailed with a total score of 298. It was only 8 years till the club once again hosted the competition in 1983 when Charlie Banks won with a score of 294. A further 9 years later in 1992 the club hosted the competition for the 4th time with Ignacio Garrido of Spain taking the trophy with a score of 280.\nIn March 2013 Notts Golf Club was selected by England Golf to host the Brabazon Trophy again in 2015 after an absence of 23 years. The 2015 Brabazon Trophy was won by Cormac Sharvin of Northern Ireland with a seven under par score.\nEnglish Amateur.\nThe club has also hosted the English Amateur on 4 occasions during its history, it first hosted the competition in 1935 when John Woollam was victorious. It did not host the competition again unit 1964 when David Marsh won, following this the club next hosted the competition in 1996 when Shaun P. Webster won. The club most recently hosted the competition in 2004 when James Heath beat David Horsey in the final.\nBritish Ladies Amateur Golf Championship.\nHollinwell hosted the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship once in 1978 when Edwina Kennedy of Australia was victorious over Julia Greenhalgh of England in the final.\nJohn Player Classic.\nThe club hosted the inaugural John Player Classic in 1970 when Christy O'Connor Snr triumphed by one stroke over Tony Jacklin. At the time the $60,000 first place prize was the largest ever from a professional tournament hosted in England.\nJohn Player Trophy.\nThe club also hosted the John Player Trophy on the European Tour in 1970, a tournament which was won by Clive Clark.\nBritish PGA Matchplay Championship.\nThe British PGA Matchplay Championship then known as the News of the World Match Play was the first professional tournament hosted by the club in 1906 and was won by Sandy Herd.\nBritish Masters.\nThe club hosted the British Masters for the only time in its history in 1957 when Eric Brown of Scotland won with a score of 275.\nHaig Whisky TPC.\nHollinwell hosted the Haig Whisky TPC on the European Tour in 1982 when Nick Faldo won with an 18 under par score of 270.\nBoys Amateur Championship.\nIn 2012 the club hosted the Boys Amateur Championship for the 1st time alongside Coxmoor Golf Club, the competition was won by future English Amateur winner Matt Fitzpatrick, in the final Fitzpatrick won 10&amp;8.\nJacques Léglise Trophy.\nIn 2007 the club hosted the Jacques Léglise Trophy for boys' team golf between Great Britain and Ireland and Continental Europe, the competition was won by Great Britain and Ireland by a margin of thirteen and a half points to ten and a half."

        "text": "Tyler Ryan Johnson (born May 7, 1992) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Brisbane Bullets of the Australian National Basketball League (NBL). He played college basketball for Fresno State University.\nEarly life.\nJohnson attended St. Francis High School in Mountain View, California.\nCollege career.\nIn his four-year career at Fresno State University, Johnson appeared in 127 games (87 starts) and averaged 10.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.1 steals in 27.9 minutes per game while shooting 45.6 percent from the field, 37.4 percent from three-point range and 71.6 percent from the free-throw line. He finished his career ranked number 16 on Fresno State's all-time scoring list with 1,346 career points. As a senior, he was named to the All-Mountain West Conference second team and shot 43.2 percent from three-point range, the sixth-highest single-season three-point field goal percentage in school history.\nProfessional career.\nSioux Falls Skyforce (2014–2015).\nAfter going undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, Johnson joined the Miami Heat for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On August 7, 2014, he signed with the Heat, but was later waived by the team on October 25. On November 3, he was acquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Heat.\nMiami Heat (2015).\nOn January 12, 2015, Johnson signed a 10-day contract with the Heat. Three days later, he made his NBA debut against the Golden State Warriors, appearing for 1:44 minutes and scoring two points on a pair of free throws.\nReturn to the Skyforce (2015).\nOn January 22, the Heat decided to not retain Johnson after his contract expired and two days later, he returned to the Skyforce.\nReturn to Miami (2015–2019).\nJohnson later re-joined the Heat on January 29 as he signed another 10-day contract with the team. On February 8, he signed a two-year deal with the Heat. On March 2, he had a season-best game with 26 points and 4 steals in a 115–98 win over the Phoenix Suns. Five days later, he scored 24 points and played in a career-high 44 minutes off the bench as he helped the Heat defeat the Sacramento Kings, 114–109. He topped that minutes mark by playing in all 48 minutes of the Heat's season finale win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\nOn July 9, 2015, Johnson was sidelined for six weeks with a broken jaw that he sustained while playing for the Heat during the 2015 NBA Summer League. On December 9, 2015, he scored a season-high 20 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He later missed eight games during December with a shoulder injury. Johnson fought through his left shoulder pain during January before missing the team's final two games of the month after succumbing to the pain. After initially trying to avoid surgery, Johnson ultimately gave into the idea on February 1, 2016, a procedure that ruled him out for three months. He returned to action on May 1, coming off the bench for the final six minutes of the Heat's Game 7 win over the Charlotte Hornets in the first round of the playoffs.\nAfter the 2015–16 season, Johnson became a restricted free agent. On July 6, 2016, he received a four-year, $50 million offer sheet from the Brooklyn Nets. Four days later, the Heat matched the Nets' contract offer, re-signing Johnson. On December 7, 2016, he scored a career-high 27 points in a 103–95 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. He topped that mark on December 20, scoring 32 points—the most any Heat reserve has ever scored in a game—in a 136–130 double overtime loss to the Orlando Magic. The previous Heat scoring record by a reserve was 29 points, by Voshon Lenard in 1999.\nOn December 30, 2017, Johnson scored 22 of his season-high 31 points in the third quarter of the Heat's 117–111 win over the Magic.\nOn December 23, 2018, Johnson scored 20 of his 25 points in the third quarter of the Heat's 115–91 win over the Magic.\nPhoenix Suns (2019–2020).\nOn February 6, 2019, Johnson was traded, along with Wayne Ellington, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Ryan Anderson. On February 23, he scored a season-high 29 points in a 120–112 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Two days later, he scored 18 points against his former team, the Miami Heat, to help the Suns snap a franchise-record 17-game losing streak to win 124–121. On April 4, 2019, Johnson was ruled out for the rest of the season after missing 10 games with right knee soreness and undergoing arthroscopic surgery. On February 9, 2020, Johnson was waived by the Suns.\nBrooklyn Nets (2020–2021).\nOn June 24, 2020, Johnson signed with the Brooklyn Nets. On November 27, he re-signed with the Nets. In 39 games played with Brooklyn, he averaged 5.4 points, 2 rebounds, and 1.2 assists in an average of 17 minutes per game. In the Nets' elimination from the NBA playoffs against the eventual champion Milwaukee Bucks, Johnson totalled 4 points, 2 rebounds, and 5 assists in a combined 22 minutes of action. Johnson won praise for his personality fit and work with the Nets second unit, but Brooklyn chose not to re-sign him in free agency.\nPhiladelphia 76ers (2021–2022).\nOn December 22, 2021, Johnson signed a 10-day contract with the Philadelphia 76ers, via the hardship exemption. He appeared in three games and averaged 3.7 points and 2.0 rebounds per game.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2022).\nOn January 6, 2022, Johnson signed a 10-day contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He appeared in three games, and averaged 2 points, 2 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game for the Spurs.\nBrisbane Bullets (2022–2023).\nOn July 30, 2022, Johnson signed with the Brisbane Bullets in Australia for the 2022–23 NBL season.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson is the son of Jennifer and Milton Johnson, and has four siblings: Brandon, Lauren, Logan, and Gabe. His mother is in the United States Air Force. Johnson's biggest hobby off the court is cooking."

A wing-forward, Oliphant represented Manawatu, Wellington, Auckland and Hawke's Bay at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 1893 and 1896. He played three games for the All Blacks but did not appear in any test matches.\nIn 1897, Oliphant was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society of Australasia for saving a girl, Margaret Purnell, from drowning in Auckland Harbour on 29 May 1896.\nFollowing the death of Sir Henry Braddon in 1955, Oliphant held the distinction of being the oldest living All Black. He died on 18 January 1956 in Auckland and was buried at O'Neill's Point Cemetery in Bayswater.\nIn January 1915, Oliphant volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and gave his date of birth as 22 January 1872, but it is likely that he falsified this so that he would be considered young enough for service. He served in Samoa throughout the war, reaching the rank of armourer sergeant."

        "title": "Surfing in Indonesia",
        "text": "Introduced to Indonesia in the 1930s, surfing now attracts both Indonesian and foreign surfers to numerous locations across the nation.\nHistory.\nThe first surfer in Indonesia was the American Bob Koke who surfed at Kuta Beach in Bali in the mid to late 1930s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Indonesian surfing beaches were featured in the 1972 Australian surfing film \"Morning of the Earth\" and foreign surfers started coming to Bali. The sport later spread to locations such as Nias Island, G-Land in Java, and the Mentawai Islands.\nIn 2003, the Indonesian Surfing Championships (ISC) were launched by Tipi Jabrik, with the first edition in 2004 in partnership with Quiksilver. \nIn 2007, surfing was admitted into the 2007 Asian Beach Games in Bali as a sport by the International Olympic Committee.\nIn 2008, the ISC gained a partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in 2008. This partnership lasted almost five years, including the creation of the Asian Surfing Championships (ASC) from the success of the ISC. \nIn 2013, the Rip Curl Cup was staged at Padang Padang (won by Mega Semadhi from Pecatu, Bali), That same year, the Oakley Pro Bali, the 5th stop of the world tour, was staged in Bali.\nIndonesia, with its vast coastline and pristine waters, stands as a Mecca for surfers from around the globe.\nSurfing revenue.\nSurfing is a multimillion-dollar Indonesian industry. That includes transportation, accommodation, dining, entertainment, and surfing services and products. Some islands have beach communities that make a living directly from surfing, such as Lakey Peak in Sumbawa, Sorake Beach on Nias Island, and Uluwatu Beach in Bali. \nMultinational surfing brands such as Billabong, Quiksilver, and Oakley, Inc. run their Southeast Asia operation and distribution out of their Bali headquarters. Regional governments have held ASC surfing contests to promote their waves and beaches. \nIt is estimated that the surfing business generates more than half-billion dollars in Bali alone, which represents more than 10% of the amount generated by tourism. Taking into account that the largest part of the surfers in Bali are tourists, surfing can be considered as a major part of tourism in Indonesia.\nIndonesian surfers.\nRizal Tanjung was the first Indonesian to compete on the WQS. He was one of the first Indonesian surfers to travel as a professional surfer. He won the Indonesian Surfing Championship circuit in 2002 and 2006. He was called \"The most recognizable Asian surfer alive\" by \"Transworld Surf\" magazine. He also owns Kurawa and Rizt (two brands). He appeared in many surfing videos, including \"Loose Change\" and \"Stranger Than Fiction\".\nOney Anwar was the first surfer from Sumbawa to compete on the WQS. He learned to surf in Lakey Peak and joined the Rip Curl team when he was 10. He moved to Australia in a Rip Curl program for young surfers and came back later in Indonesia. He is now internationally known and looking to qualify for the WCT.\nRaditya Rondi has been winning the Asian Surfing Championships since their creation in 2011. Indeed, he won the title of champion three consecutive years.\nRio Waida, resident of Uluwatu, Bali, is a current competitor in the World Surf League. Rio will represent Indonesia in surfing at the Paris Olympic Games in 2024.\nSurf spots in Indonesia.\nJava.\nJava has many surf spots, including G-Land.\nLombok.\nLombok has several surf locations.\nMentawai Islands.\nThe Mentawai Islands have several surf spots accessible by boat:\nPanaitan Islands.\nOn Panaitan, people surf at One Palm Point and Apocalypse.\nSumatra.\nIn Sumatra, Krui is a surf beach located at .\nSumbawa.\nThe most famous surf posts on Sumbawa are Lakey Peak and Scar Reef."

If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time would be played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie would be decided by penalty shoot-out.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nMatches against the sixth-placed team in each group are not included in this ranking. As a result, eight matches played by each team counted for the purposes of the second-placed table.\nThe ranking of the runners-up is determined by the following parameters in this order:\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 23 September 2014 at 14:00 local time at Nyon, Switzerland.\nSeeding.\nIn the play-off draw, teams were seeded according to their UEFA Women's National Team Coefficient Ranking (shown in brackets).\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll times are CEST () during summer and CET () during winter.\nSemifinals.\nNetherlands won 4–1 on aggregate and advanced to final.\nItaly won 4–3 on aggregate and advanced to final.\nFinal.\nNetherlands won 3–2 on aggregate and qualified for 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup."

As a sophomore in 1972–73, the first year he was eligible to play for the varsity squad, he averaged over 12 points per game. He broke his foot during the season, and coupled with academic under-performance, Washington decided to pursue his professional career instead of returning to North Carolina for his junior year.

He also plays for the Ireland national rugby sevens team as a forward.\nMcGrath was educated at Catholic University School (CUS) in Dublin, a school better known for cricket rather than rugby.\nAfter a short stint with Plymouth Albion R.F.C. he secured a place in a wider Leinster Rugby training squad whilst playing club rugby with Clontarf, eventually securing a full contract. He made his senior debut in September 2014 against Scarlets. He was called up to the Leinster senior squad for the season commencing 2014–15 following impressive performances in the All-Ireland League. However, he was released from Leinster.\nMcGrath was the All-Ireland League Division 1A top try scorer in 2014, 2015, and again in 2016. McGrath was part of the Leicester Tigers wider training squad during the summer of 2016, but returned to Clontarf for the 2016-17 season. McGrath was noted for his outstanding performance in a losing effort in the 2017 All-Ireland League final.\nNational team.\nMcGrath has been involved with the Ireland national rugby sevens team. He was a member of the 2016 squad that attempted unsuccessfully to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics. He was a member of the Ireland sevens squad that finished second in the 2017 Sevens Grand Prix Series, qualifying for the 2018 Hong Kong Sevens and the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens.

        "title": "2014 United States FIBA Basketball World Cup team",
        "text": "The United States men's national basketball team won the gold medal at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup held in Spain. Prior to 2014, the event was known as the FIBA World Championship. The 24-team tournament was held from August 30 to September 14, and the victory automatically qualified the U.S. into the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. Kyrie Irving was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the tournament.\nThe United States had automatically qualified for the World Cup by virtue of the gold medal won by their 2012 Olympic team. The Americans were expected to win the World Cup, and advanced to the knockout phase after starting the tournament 5–0 during the group stage. They were an undefeated 9–0 in the tournament, winning by an average margin of 33.0 points. The United States was just the third country in World Cup history to repeat as champions. Combined with their 2010 World Championship along with gold by their 2008 and 2012 Olympic teams, they also became the first country in FIBA basketball history to win four consecutive major titles.\nRoster.\nThe squad consisted of only six former NBA All-Stars after multiple players declined to participate. Still, the team remained deep in NBA talent, and was considered the favorite to win the championship. Holdovers included 2012 Olympic gold medalists James Harden and Anthony Davis, in addition to Stephen Curry, Derrick Rose, and Rudy Gay from the 2010 championship team. The 2014 roster featured four players or larger, the most of any US team since Mike Krzyzewski began coaching the team in 2006. The team was also the youngest American team since 1992, when NBA players were first allowed on the team; the average player was 24.08 years old, roughly a half-year younger than their 2010 team.\nIn January 2014, USA Basketball announced their initial 28-man list of players to be considered for their roster for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Players on the list who withdrew themselves from World Cup consideration were LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler, Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala, LeBron James, David Lee, Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and Deron Williams.\nA 19-man preliminary roster was announced on July 14, 2014. Two of the players, DeMar DeRozan and Chandler Parsons, were not named to the initial January roster. On July 25, Blake Griffin pulled out due to concerns with his back, and John Wall was named as a replacement. Mired in unresolved trade talks between his Minnesota Timberwolves and other teams, Kevin Love withdrew on July 25. Love was replaced on the training camp roster by Paul Millsap on July 27. The day before, USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said that final squad members could also potentially come from the Select Team that is scrimmaging with the main camp roster in Las Vegas. On July 29, Mason Plumlee was promoted to the senior team to give them an extra big man.\nDuring a scrimmage on August 1, Paul George suffered a compound fracture of both bones in his lower right leg, and underwent surgery hours after the injury. George's injury was similar to one suffered by Louisville Cardinals player Kevin Ware during an 2013 NCAA tournament game against the Duke Blue Devils, coached by Krzyzewski.\nThe next set of cuts came on August 5, when Wall, Millsap, and Bradley Beal were cut. On August 7, Kevin Durant withdrew from the team, citing physical and mental fatigue. Coupled with George's injury, the small forward position went from being a strength to a weakness for Team USA. Shortly after Durant's withdrawal, Gay was added to the preliminary roster. Kyle Korver, Chandler Parsons, Gordon Hayward, and Damian Lillard were the final cuts on the team. Big men Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Andre Drummond, and Plumlee—a Krzyzewski favorite whom he previously coached at Duke—were kept in anticipation of facing Spain in the title game against their frontline trio of Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, and Serge Ibaka. Rose made the team after team officials were confident in the health of the 2010–11 NBA Most Valuable Player, despite his playing in just 10 games the prior two NBA seasons due to knee injuries.\nPreliminary round.\nTeam USA entered the opening round with a 54-game winning steak, including exhibition games. They completed group play 5–0, averaging 102.2 points with an average victory margin of 33.2. They competed in Group C with the , , , and . Each team played the other respective teams from the group once, for a total of five games per team, with all the games being played at Bizkaia Arena in Barakaldo (at Greater Bilbao). After all the games were played, the four teams with the best records from each group qualified for the final round.\nThe U.S. had few problems advancing to the knockout round, though they habitually started games slowly, and their guards had yet to meet expectations to consistently excel on offense. The team was most dangerous when playing in transition, while they struggled at times in their half-court offense.\n\"All times are local to Spain, UTC+2.\"\nFinland.\nThe Americans held Finland without a field goal in the second quarter, outscoring them 29–2 in the period en route to a 114–55 blowout victory. Klay Thompson scored 18 points and Davis added 17 to lead the U.S. The Americans quieted the vocal Finnish fans, who filled an entire side of the arena, by holding their opponents to 0-for-17 shooting in the second quarter. They forced 17 first-half turnovers to build a 60–18 lead by halftime.\nTeam USA shot 59 percent from the field as every American scored. Rose added 12 points playing a team-high 23 minutes, and Gay had 10 against Finland, who were ranked 39th, the lowest ranked team to ever receive a wild card from FIBA. The Finns finished the game with 31 turnovers and only five assists.\nTurkey.\nIn a rematch of the 2010 gold-medal game, the U.S. was behind 40–35 at the half and Turkey led by six early in the third quarter before the Americans pulled away for a 98–77 win. Despite the final margin, the U.S. did not manage a double-digit lead until 8:57 remaining in game. The Turks effectively slowed the pace of the game for much of the first three quarters before Team USA used a 17–1 run to pull away. Kenneth Faried led the U.S. with 22 points and eight rebounds.\nThe game was unexpectedly tough after Team USA's 59-point rout against Finland and Turkey's needing to rally to win 76–73 against New Zealand. The Americans and Turks were tied at 16 after one quarter, and the U.S. showed frustration in the second period over the pace of the game and calls that went against them. The U.S. could not get into their transition game, unable to force turnovers or missed shots from Turkey. Davis had been the best player during the summer, but he was scoreless and had only one rebound in the first half as he was limited to minutes while committing two fouls. The Turks held a 21–12 rebounding edge at the half, and had shot 18 free throws to the Americans 5. The game was tied at 59 with 3:10 remaining in the third when the Americans went on a 7–1 run to lead 66–60 after a basket by Faried. They opened the fourth quarter with 10 unanswered points to pull ahead 76–60.\nDavis scored all of his 19 points in the second half, and finished with six rebounds. Harden added 14 points, and Kyrie Irving scored 13 while playing extended minutes with a struggling Rose on the bench until Team USA was safely ahead in the fourth quarter. Without Ersan İlyasova and Enes Kanter on their team and Hedo Türkoğlu retired from international play, Ömer Aşık was the only NBA player on Turkey's roster; they did return eight players from their 2010 team. \"I guess we felt like last night's game was pretty easy and tonight was going to be the same way\", Harden said. Added Krzyzewski: \"The big lesson for our team is you can’t take things for granted, especially when you’re playing teams the caliber of Turkey\".\nNew Zealand.\nTeam USA led the game from beginning to end and won 98–71 over New Zealand. The game was close for a little more than a quarter before the Americans overpowered the Kiwis with their inside game. The U.S. was led by Davis' 21 points and nine rebounds, and Faried scored 15 and had 11 boards—including seven on the offensive end.\nThe score was 27–20 after the first quarter, and the Americans were leading by nine when they went on a 12–0 run behind seven points by Irving. The streak featured Team USA's transition game, but they frequently took advantage of Davis' and Faried's inside game in the first half. Rose started the second half in place of Irving, as Krzyzewski wanted the former NBA MVP to receive more playing time with starters. He played the first 6:17 of the third and started the fourth as well. Harden scored 13, and Curry finished the game with 12 points after struggling with just 4-for-17 shooting in the opening two games. Thompson also scored 12, while Irving added 10, as Team USA had six players in double figures.\nFaried, who entered the game shooting 14-of-17, made 7-for-9 in the game for an overall 80.8 percent in the series. \"Overall, from the start of training camp, he's been the biggest and best surprise and has turned out to be a very, very important player for us\", Krzyzewski said. \"He’s made that happen. We never call a play for him\".\nDominican Republic.\nThe Americans cruised to 106–71 victory over the Dominican Republic after a sluggish first quarter. A 25–22 first-quarter lead grew to 15 by the half, and the U.S. led 92–52 after a 22–0 second-half run. Faried led the team with 16 points and added six rebounds, and Cousins also scored 13.\nThe Dominican Republic was playing without injured Francisco Garcia, who was averaging a team-high 21 points per game, but remained close after Team USA missed five free throws in the first period. The U.S. led by seven in the second quarter when Faried scored three consecutive baskets and Davis hit a jumper to build a comfortable 44–29 lead. The Americans scored 25 points in the third and another 25 in the fourth, including a series of dunks by end-of-the-bench players Drummond and Plumlee. The team exceeded triple digits for the second time after scoring 98 in each of the previous two wins.\nUkraine.\nUkraine slowed the pace of the game for most of the first half before Team USA overcame another poor start for a 95–71 win. Harden had his best game during group play with a team-high 17 points. The only major scare for the U.S. occurred near the end of the game when Irving fell hard.\nThe Ukrainians slowed the pace of the game for the first quarter and a half, and led 19–14 after the first period. They remained ahead 27–25 midway through the second until Curry made a pair of three-point field goals during a 19–5 spurt in the last 4:43 that gave the U.S. a 44–32 lead at the half. The Americans led 69–54 after three, and were never in danger of losing in the second half. Irving left the game with 1:12 remaining after slipping and falling hard on his tailbone; he walked off holding his lower back. He said he was \"fine\" after the game, and the team stated it did not \"anticipate a serious injury\".\nCurry scored 14, one of six Americans in double figures. Ukraine was coached by former NBA coach Mike Fratello, and they were led by NBA player Viacheslav Kravtsov's team-high 15 points.\nFinal round.\nThe U.S. advanced to the knockout stage in which the top four teams from the respective preliminary round groups qualified in the single-elimination tournament. The losers in the semifinals will play for the bronze medal. Teams from Groups A and B will play at the Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad de Madrid in Madrid, while those from Groups C and D play at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona. The third place game and the final will be held at the Madrid arena.\nRound of 16 – Mexico.\nThe U.S. avoided another slow start and Curry scored 20 while making six three-pointers in an 86–63 win over Mexico. Curry was 7-of-10 from the field and 6-for-9 from outside. Thompson, Curry's teammate on the Golden State Warriors, added 15 points, and the Americans made 13 three-pointers.\nTeam USA jumped out to an early 13–2 lead before Mexico scored seven unanswered points. The Americans stretched the lead to 23–13 after one quarter, and the lead remained in double digits for most of the second period for a 42–27 halftime lead. Curry then made back-to-back threes to make it 50–27. Davis and Faried, Team USA's dominant players in the first round, scored four and eight points, respectively. Instead, the team's top three scorers were its perimeter players; Harden added 12 points.\nCousins, who Krzyzewski commended for another strong outing, made all five of his shots for 11 points and added seven rebounds. Mexico's Gustavo Ayón, who played in the NBA in 2013–14, finished with 25 points.\nQuarterfinals – Slovenia.\nTeam USA won 119–76 after a troubled first half against a Slovenia team they comfortably handled in an exhibition game two weeks earlier. The Americans were led by Thompson's 20 points, and Harden scored 12 of his 14 in the third period.\nThe U.S. missed 10 of their first 11 shots and misfired on 21 overall in the first quarter, but their 14 offensive rebounds led to 15 second-chance points for a 29–22 lead after one. Slovenia made 70 percent of its two-pointers in the first half, but the Americans still led 49–42 despite shooting just 36 percent overall in the first two quarters; Harden and Curry were a combined 0-for-12. Team USA led by just five early in the third before going on a 27–10 run, as Slovenian turnovers led to American dunks. The U.S. scored the first 10 points in the fourth for a 96–64 lead.\nFaried had 14 points with 10 rebounds, and Davis added 13 and 11. The U.S. finished with 23 offensive rebounds and 53 overall, which Slovenia coach Jure Zdovc called the difference in the game. Rose added 12 points on 6-for-12 shooting after going just 8-for-37 in the first six games of the World Cup. Slovenia was led by Goran Dragić's 12 points. He combined with brother Zoran Dragić for 24 points on 27 shots and nine rebounds.\nSemifinals – Lithuania.\nHarden scored all 16 of his points in the third quarter, when the United States outscored Lithuania 33–14 for a 96–68 victory. After a tight first half, the U.S. started forcing turnovers to trigger its fast break, opening up the game. Irving scored 18 points and Thompson had 16 off the bench.\nThe first half was dominated by fouls on both sides, and the Americans led at the half 43–35. Late in the half, Cousins was elbowed in the throat by Lithuanian center Jonas Valančiūnas while boxing out for a rebound. Cousins then charged at him without throwing a punch, and received a technical foul. For the second straight game, Harden was scoreless in the first half. He scored the first field goal of the second half, and finished a 10–0 U.S. run with a three pointer that put the team ahead 53–35 in under two minutes. An 18–2 run to start the half was capped by a lob from Irving to Davis for the basket. Team USA made 14 of 19 shots in the quarter to build a 76–49 lead to start the fourth.\nCurry received his fourth foul two minutes into the second half, and Davis fouled out early in the fourth quarter after receiving a technical for his fifth foul. Valančiūnas and Mindaugas Kuzminskas both scored 15 points for Lithuania. Entering the contest, Kuzminskas averaged 2.4 points in five games in the tournament for Lithuania while averaging a team-low 9.0 minutes.\nFinal – Serbia.\nSerbia made their first five shots of the game to jump to a 10–5 lead. After a U.S. timeout, Serbia scored anew, then the Americans had a 17–3 run to go up by seven. Irving and Thompson scored three-pointers to give the U.S. a 35–21 lead. In the second quarter, the Americans made six more three point shots to give them a 26-point lead at the half. Team USA held its largest lead of 39 points by the middle of the third quarter. The final deficit of 37 points and the 129 overall points scored were the largest in a World Cup final since Team USA's 137–91 victory over in the 1994 FIBA World Championship. The Americans also became the third team, along with and , to successfully defend the world title, and tied the Yugoslavs with having the most championships, with five.\nThe Americans shot 58% from the field and 50% from beyond the three-point line in the game, won all nine games by an average of 33.0 points, and qualified to the 2016 Olympics. Irving was named the tournament MVP. He and Faried were both named to the All-Tournament Team."

        "text": "The 2014 Super Rugby Final, was played between the New South Wales Waratahs from Australia and the Crusaders from New Zealand on 2 August 2014. It was the 19th final in the Super Rugby competition's history and the fourth under the expanded 15-team format. The Waratahs had qualified in first place during the regular season, while the Crusaders had qualified in second place. Both teams hosted semi-final matches, with the Waratahs defeating fellow Australian team the Brumbies in Sydney and the Crusaders defeating South African team the Sharks in Christchurch. As the Waratahs had qualified higher, the final was held in Sydney.\nThe final attracted the Super Rugby record attendance of 61,823 to the ANZ Stadium.\nRoad to the final.\nThe 2014 Super Rugby competition involved fifteen teams, five each from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The 2014 season was the 19th year of the competition, and the fourth in the expanded 15 team format (12 teams competed between 1996 and 2005, before increasing to 14 between 2006 and 2010). The 2014 competition began on 15 February with the regular season consisting of 120 matches over twenty-two weeks. Each team played the others from their own conference (both home and away), plus four out of five teams from the other two countries (two at home and two away in each case). The top six teams after the regular season advanced to the finals.\nThe Waratahs finished top of the Australian conference and topped the overall standings, with twelve wins and just four losses during the season (to the Brumbies, Western Force, Blues, and Sharks). The Crusaders finished top of the New Zealand conference with eleven wins and five losses—to the Hurricanes (twice), Chiefs, Blues, and Sharks. The Sharks won the South African conference, and the Brumbies, Chiefs and Highlanders filled the remaining three places as the next top finishers during the regular season.\nThe Brumbies hosted the Chiefs in Canberra in the first qualifying final, while the Highlanders traveled to Durban to play the Sharks. The Brumbies and Chiefs scored four tries apiece in the first qualifier, but the Brumbies prevailed with Christian Lealiifano successful with five kicks from eight off the tee in their 32–30 victory. The second qualifier was also a close match with the Sharks and Highlanders scoring three tries each, but the Sharks came from behind with two penalty kicks by François Steyn in the final 6 minutes to win by 31–27.\nFor the semi-finals, the Sharks flew to Christchurch to play the Crusaders and the Brumbies travelled to Sydney to play the Waratahs. Both games were won by a clear margin in the end but the run of play in each match was substantially different. The Crusaders scored five tries to nil to defeat the Sharks by 38–6. The Brumbies, by contrast, were not shut out of the game until Waratahs' fly-half Bernard Foley scored ten points in last seven minutes to secure victory for his side by 26–8."

        "text": "Hunter Greene is an American basketball player, who played college basketball at the University of New Mexico from 1983 to 1988. At 6' 6\" he played primarily guard and wing. He was a versatile all-around player, accomplished scorer, and strong defender for the Lobos and head coach Gary Colson.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nGreene played high school basketball at Van Nuys High School, where he was 3A Player of the Year in Southern California in 1982–83. He only began playing organized basketball as a sophomore in high school, and \nhe played sparingly in his first year at New Mexico, averaging 1.4 points in 25 game appearances. He continued developing his skills in a pro-am circuit summer league in Los Angeles, getting more comfortable as a guard and shooter.\nThe summer league work paid off, and as a sophomore, in 1984–85, Greene became a starter for the Lobos, averaging 11.4 points and 4.3 rebounds a game. Greene shared backcourt duties with fellow sophomore Kelvin Scarborough, and the young Lobo squad went 19–13 with an appearance in the NIT. Four starters were returning for the 1985–86 season, but Greene was injured during a preseason practice and missed the season.\nJunior and senior seasons.\nGreene returned for his junior year in 1986–87 to lead New Mexico with 21.1 points and 6.2 rebounds a game. The team set the Lobo season record for most steals, and Greene set the individual Lobo record for number of steals in a season (84). Scarborough averaged 18.9 points and six assists and set the Lobo career record for steals. The Lobos beat Texas and Oklahoma State and built a 17–5 record before losing three straight on the road in a strong year for the WAC. They then won eight straight and reached the conference tournament final, missing a last second shot and losing to Wyoming, which would go on to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament. The WAC placed three teams in the NCAA, but the Lobos settled for the NIT. They finished the season 25–10, the most wins for a Lobo team up to that time.\nGreene was a smooth scorer and versatile player who maintained a composed countenance on the court, leading quietly by example. As a senior, he averaged 16.8 points and 6.8 rebounds and again led the team in steals. His most memorable moment came in a game named by a panel of writers as the top game ever at The Pit, the home venue of the Lobos. New Mexico was hosting #1 Arizona, led by All-Americans Sean Elliott and Steve Kerr. The Lobos built an early 25–9 lead, and the Wildcats slowly came back. Elliott had a chance to put Arizona into the lead with seconds left, but Greene blocked the shot to seal the win, the only time the Lobos have beaten a #1-ranked team. New Mexico beat #5 Wyoming a week later and climbed into the rankings at #19. They fell into a 6–10 slide, however, struggling badly on the road. They again went to the NIT, where they won two games before losing in the quarter-finals to finish the season 22–14.\nGreene finished his career as the leading scorer in Lobo history, with 1,745 points, though he has since fallen to seventh, and he is second in career steals, behind Scarborough. He is the only Lobo ever to surpass 1,500 points, 600 rebounds, 300 assists, and 200 steals. The Lobos went 90–48 during his four years, with four NIT appearances.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter his playing career, Greene went into commercial real estate in Albuquerque. He also works as a color analyst on local radio broadcasts of Lobo basketball games."

A new route is being devised linking Meanwood and Chapeltown with the city centre.\nCycle Superhighway.\nWest Yorkshire Metro proposed a 23 km \"cycle superhighway\" linking the city centres of Leeds and Bradford via Pudsey, with another route between Leeds City Centre and Shipley while both western routes would be linked to an eastern route linking Leeds City Centre with Seacroft, Swarcliffe and Cross Gates using the A64 as its artery. Work began on the scheme in 2015 with the main East-West artery being completed in 2017.\nLeisure cycling.\nThere are a number of cycle routes in and around the city aimed at recreational cyclists, such as the Harland Way around Wetherby and the 127 mile long towpath by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. For BMX cycling there are the Adel Woods Dirt Tracks. There are a number of cycling clubs in the city such as Leeds BMX and Seacroft Wheelers.\nEvents.\nLeeds hosted the Grand Depart for the 2014 Tour de France, with the depart starting from outside the town hall, with the peloton continuing up to Harewood House where racing began. Other events include the Big Leeds Bike Ride. The city has also hosted the Tour de Yorkshire on multiple occasions."

        "title": "Mamadou N'Diaye (basketball, born 1993)",
        "text": "Mamadou N'Diaye ( ; born 14 September 1993) is a Senegalese professional basketball player who last played for Correcaminos UAT Victoria of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP). He played college basketball for UC Irvine, where he was the tallest basketball player at the NCAA Division I level, standing at .\nN'Diaye, a center, was named Big West Conference Defensive Player of the Year after the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season and earned all-conference honorable mention accolades as well. He was considered a talented shot-blocker.\nEarly life.\nN'Diaye was born in Dakar, Senegal. He had an older brother. He grew up playing soccer and did not seriously begin playing basketball at a young age. In 2010, Amadou Koundoul, who was the assistant coach for the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team at the time, saw N'Diaye participate in a pick-up game in a gymnasium at Dakar. He asked him to travel to the United States, and N'Diaye accepted the offer. He arrived in the US without knowing how to speak English. In the new country, he initially had trouble with speaking English and often needed things to be translated to French.\nAfter experiencing headaches upon his arrival to the U.S., N'Diaye saw a doctor and it was discovered that he was suffering from a golf ball-sized tumor in his pituitary gland, which had caused gigantism and was threatening his vision. Afterwards, he recalled the moment, \"For me, it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t know what a tumor was. Once I found out, it was tough to hear I had one.\" The condition was treated in the Hoag Memorial Hospital following several charitable donations from around the area. A married couple who lived in Huntington Beach, California, a city close to N'Diaye's future school, offered to become his guardians to ease his commute for medical treatments.\nHigh school career.\nPrior to participating in sports, N'Diaye attended Stoneridge Prep in Simi Valley, California, who steered him through his early years in the United States. The school had a history of producing high-caliber international basketball players, including Enes Kanter and Nikola Vučević. However, N'Diaye was not allowed to play the sport during his first year in the high school because of California Interscholastic Federation rules. As a sophomore, he was officially granted the permission to transfer to another high school.\nN'Diaye attended Brethren Christian School in Huntington Beach, California. He played under head coach Jon Bahnsen. According to Bahnsen upon arriving at the school, N'Diaye \"could barely get up and down the court more than a few times\" due to his poor fitness after rehabilitation. In his high school years, N'Diaye, who stood at the time, was considered one of the tallest to play at that level. He was also approached by the Guinness World Records to determine the authenticity of the claims. Bahnsen said, \"Our school wouldn't cooperate with them, but Guinness probably wanted to see if he was the world's tallest high school basketball player.\"\nAs a junior at Brethren Christian, N'Diaye finished the season averaging 24 points and 14 rebounds. CBS News wrote that he was \"impossible to defend\" because of his height. At the conclusion of his final, senior season with Brethren Christian, N'Diaye averaged about 27 points, 14 rebounds, and 4.5 blocks. He partook his highest-scoring game in January 2013 against Oxford Academy, with 45 points and 15 rebounds coming off an illness that kept him out of the initial games. After the year, N'Diaye earned All-State honors and was named CIF-5AA Player of the Year. He also earned the 2013 John R. Wooden High School Player of the Year award for CIF Division V. In the same season, N'Diaye garnered National Christian Schools Athletic Association Player of the Year and Far West Super-Region team accolades. Also, he was named Academy League Most Valuable Player.\nAccording to the ESPN Recruiting Nation, N'Diaye was the 6th most promising high school player in his state. ESPN analysts commented on N'Diaye's basketball talent by saying, \"Ndiaye is a legit 7-foot-5 prospect with extraordinary length and huge hands.\" He officially committed to play with the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team, following matriculation at the University of California, Irvine, on 14 November 2012. He also considered Oregon, Georgetown, and Pepperdine. N'Diaye said that he selected UC Irvine because he \"felt very comfortable at the university and with the coaching staff.\"\nCollege career.\nFreshman year.\nUpon joining the UC Irvine basketball program, N'Diaye was instantly recognized as the tallest player in the NCAA Division I. Russell Turner, the head basketball coach, said, \"I'm excited to add a player of Mamadou's quality and character to our program.\"\nOn 2 November 2013, N'Diaye represented UC Irvine for the first time in an exhibition game vs. Chapman. He finished with 9 points, a team-high 7 rebounds and 5 blocks. Turner said after the game, \"I was pleased with Mamadou's play. He is a dominating factor at times and he will be a factor that other teams will have to deal with.\" N'Diaye made his collegiate debut on 8 November 2013 against Fresno State with 5 points, 4 rebounds, and 1 block as the starting center. He also shot 1-of-1 from the field and 3-of-10 from the free throw line. However, the team lost the game at the buzzer.\nWhen the Anteaters defeated the Washington Huskies men's basketball team on 14 November 2013, N'Diaye recorded a season-high 18 points. He also added 8 rebounds and 9 blocks. The game was also his first experience in the 2K Sports Classic. His blocked shots total broke the school's single-game record under the category. He recorded his first career double-double with Irvine on 28 December 2013 against Arizona State, with 12 points, 4 blocks, and a career-high 12 rebounds. In January, in a game at rival Long Beach State, coach Dan Monson told reporters that he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye was sitting on the bench. In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record for the second time in the season, totaling with 11 blocked shots and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.\nN'Diaye finished the 2013–14 season with averages of 7.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 0.2 assists, 3.1 blocks, and 1.7 turnovers per game. Following the year, he was labeled a future top prospect by Kevin Pelton of ESPN.com, strongly due to his performance against Washington, in which he broke the school record for blocks for a single game. UC Irvine lost 58-64 in the first round of the 2014 National Invitation Tournament against SMU. They fell to Cal Poly in the 2014 Big West Conference men's basketball tournament shortly before.\nSophomore year.\nN'Diaye debuted as a sophomore on 14 November 2014, recording 9 points, 2 rebounds, and 1 block against Chapman University. He scored a career-high 21 points on 29 November, vs Loyola Marymount. This was the first time he notched over 20 points in his college career as well. This would be his season-high scoring total. N'Diaye was sidelined for two months in his second year due to a foot injury. After his team qualified for the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, he drew attention on Twitter. Louisville Cardinals men's basketball head coach Rick Pitino, who coached against UC Irvine's Russell Turner in the first round, said, \"I thought he was eight feet tall.\" The Anteaters' season ended when they lost 55-57 to Louisville, in spite of the 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 1 block N'Diaye recorded. He finished the season averaging 10.5 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks.\nJunior year.\nIn mid-April 2015, N'Diaye made it official that he would forgo the 2015 NBA draft and return to UC Irvine for his junior year. The school later released a statement, in which his coach said, \"This is great news for Mamadou and for our program. He is staying here because he is happy, he's committed to his education and he is thriving. I feel really good about those things.\" Following his second season with the Anteaters, websites such as CBSSports.com considered him a player that would need to play in the NBA Development League before joining a National Basketball Association roster.\nBy his junior year, N'Diaye was no longer the tallest NCAA player. He faced fellow Senegalese player Tacko Fall in the tallest tip-off and match-up in US college basketball history in a game against the UCF Knights.\nDuring his junior season, N'Diaye led the Anteaters to a program-best 28 wins. He played in 37 of 38 games on the season, starting 36, and averaged 12.1 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game. He broke the UCI school record for blocks with 218 which was previously broken by former teammate Will Davis II the previous season with 208.\nOn 7 April 2016, N'Diaye declared for the 2016 NBA draft, but did not hire an agent. While he departed UC Irvine, he vowed to continue his studies in order to achieve his dream of getting a college degree. He was later named to the Senegal national basketball team's preliminary squad for the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Manila.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, N'Diaye joined the Golden State Warriors for the 2016 NBA Summer League. On 22 October 2016, he signed with the Detroit Pistons, but was waived later that afternoon. On 30 October, he was acquired by the Grand Rapids Drive of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Pistons. He was later waived by Grand Rapids on 10 November, prior to the start of the regular season.\nOn 19 September 2018 Ndiaye signed with Fuerza Regia de Monterrey in Mexico's LNBP where he had 2 appearances before being cut. Afterwards, he joined Correcaminos UAT Victoria. He averaged 15.2 points, 11 rebounds, 1.1 assists, and 1.8 blocks per game in the 2019-20 season. On 26 August 2020, N'Diaye re-signed with Correcaminos.\nPlayer profile.\nStanding seven feet, six inches tall and weighing 300 pounds, N'Diaye's wingspan (fingertip-to-fingertip reach) was measured as at the 2012 edition of the Amar'e Stoudemire Skills Academy. When he entered college, his wingspan had increased to over . He is solely used as a center due to his height, length, and size. N'Diaye's skill set was often considered \"raw\" in high school, and received comments from Brethren Christian head coach, Jon Bahnsen, who said, \"Right now his game is basically catch, turn, drop-step, dunk.\" He is also capable of touching the standard basketball rim without jumping.\nDuring the 2016 tournament season, a writer for \"SB Nation\" wrote that \"When Columbia guards find themselves one-on-one with just his frame between them and the rim, they reverse direction and scurry away, like terrified Tokyoites who just heard Godzilla stomping around. One fan screams 'You're not that tall!' at him, which is a lie. Another yells 'You're only the 36th-tallest in the world!,' which upon further research, turns out to be true.\"\nIn the past, N'Diaye has been compared with players such as Yao Ming and Rudy Gobert, who respectively stand 7'6\" and 7'1\" (2.29 m and 2.16 m) and feature a similar wingspan.\nThe Basketball Tournament (TBT).\nIn the summer of 2017, N'Diaye competed in The Basketball Tournament on ESPN for Paul Champions. Competing for the $2 million grand prize, N'Diaye helped lead his team to two victories in the TBT Jamboree which secured Paul Champions' spot as one of the 64 teams in the tournament. During the Jamboree, N'Diaye averaged 8.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game. In their first-round match up, he helped the Champions to a 78-74 victory over the Talladega Knights; a team led by former NBA players Josh Boone and Gary Forbes. N'Diaye and the Champions would eventually fall in the second-round to the number one seeded Untouchables."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team represented Georgia State University during 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team's head coach was Ron Hunter serving his fourth season at GSU. The Panthers played their home games at the GSU Sports Arena competing as members of the Sun Belt Conference. They finished the season 25–10, 15–5 in Sun Belt play to win the Sun Belt regular season championship. They defeated Louisiana–Lafayette and Georgia Southern to become champions of the Sun Belt tournament. They received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated Baylor in the second round before losing in the third round to Xavier.\nSeason notes.\nRegular season championship title.\nToward the end of the regular season, three teams would find themselves tied for first place. ULM, Georgia Southern and Georgia State were all in a position to win the championship, which brought with it a number 1 seed in the Sun Belt Tournament, as well as an automatic bid to the NIT if that team did not win the conference tournament. Heading into the first matchup against first place instate rivals Georgia Southern, the Panthers found themselves half a game behind, with a win over the Eagles set to push them ahead in the rankings to first place. While the Panthers held the lead for most of the game, including a 6-point lead at the half, the Eagles surged at the end in front of a sellout crowd of 4,325 to win the game, 58–54.\nThe loss set the Panthers back behind both ULM and Georgia Southern. The following Saturday, ULM would beat the Eagles in Statesboro, giving the Warhawks first place in conference, followed by the Eagles and finally the Panthers in third. Following that point, both teams would lose two more games with the Panthers only losing one, creating a three-way tie going into the final week of Sun Belt play. A scheduling quirk would have Georgia State play at ULM on the final Thursday of regular season play, followed by Georgia Southern at home on the final Saturday. Prior to the Thursday game against ULM, it was announced that the Sports Arena, the home court of the Panthers, was sold out for the game against Georgia Southern. The Panthers would go on to beat ULM as the Eagles beat UT-Arlington, pushing the Warhawks out of first place with no chance to recover, and making the final regular-season game at the Sports Arena the determining game for the winner of the Sun Belt regular season title.\nThe GSU women's basketball game would precede the men's game, with fans pouring in before that game had begun. During the first half of the game, leading Sun Belt scorer Ryan Harrow fell with an injury to his knee, being helped off the court and unable to put pressure on his leg. He would check back into the game with 4:40 remaining in the first half only to be taken back out after 2 and a half minutes for the rest of the game. Without Harrow, the Panthers finished the first half with an 11-point lead. However, after returning for the second half, the Eagles would cut that lead to four with a score of 38–34 after back-to-back three-pointers were scored along with a two-point jumper. R. J. Hunter went on to pull the lead back by scoring 10 consecutive points, after which the Eagles did not threaten again. Sun Belt commissioner, Karl Benson, was on hand to present the Sun Belt trophy to the team after the win, which gave the Panthers back-to-back Sun Belt Basketball regular season titles.\nPost season.\nSun Belt Tournament.\nDue to the Sun Belt Conferences tournament format, only the top eight basketball teams were eligible to compete, with the top two seeds receiving double byes straight into the tournaments semifinals. After competing for the conference regular season title in the final regular-season game, Georgia State and Georgia Southern received those top seeds, respectively. The Panthers faced Louisiana-Lafayette in their first game, the same team that had eliminated them from the title game of the previous season's Sun Belt tournament. The Panthers would end up beating the Ragin' Cajuns 83–79 after allowing them to come back in the final minutes.\nGeorgia Southern would beat ULM in their first game, setting the Panthers and the Eagles for a rematch of the unofficial regular season title game. The game would be one of the lowest scoring tournament games since such statistics have been tracked, ending in the Panthers favor with a final score of 38–36. After the final buzzer rang, the Panthers' head coach Ron Hunter rushed off the sidelines to embrace his son R. J. Hunter and began hopping as they met, both falling on the floor. It would be reported later that he had torn his Achilles tendon during the celebration. This, along with the dominating performance of Kevin Ware in the title game, would surround the Panthers in the media during the run up to the NCAA tournament, where the 14 seed would face third seed Baylor.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Panthers would face Baylor in Jacksonville, Florida, at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena. While the game was kept close throughout the first half, Baylor managed to take a three-point lead at half time by throwing up a buzzer-beating three-pointer that bobbled its way into the basket. After pulling away from the Panthers in the second half, Baylor would watch Georgia State claw its way back into the game in the final two minutes, erasing a 12-point deficit and making it a two-point game with under a minute left. After sending Baylor to the free throw line with less than 20 seconds remaining, the Panthers got the ball to R. J. Hunter, who drained a deep three-point shot with 2.8 seconds remaining to take a 1-point lead. While watching the ball go into the net, coach Ron Hunter, sitting on a stool due to his injured Achilles tendon, fell off the stool onto the court. The Panthers would pull off the upset, beating Baylor 57–56 and continuing into the third round of the tournament. The events on the court would make the team \"the darlings of the NCAA tournament\", shooting the Panthers, and especially R. J. and Ron Hunter into fame. Numerous memes and videos would be made in reference to Coach Hunter's fall, while the father-son story would result in news specials and national exposure to the team.\nThe Panthers faced Xavier in the third round of the tournament, where their season ended with a 67–75 loss.\nAftermath.\nAfter the season ended, attention to the Hunter family and the Georgia State program grew almost immediately as the TV channel covering the game switched its feed over to the post game press conference, airing video of a crying Ron Hunter explaining how proud of his team and his son he was. As the week continued, it would turn out that Georgia State would be the fourth most mentioned team on Twitter after Iowa State, Kentucky, and UAB respectively. At the same time, the second and fourth most talked about moments of the tournament were Georgia State beating Baylor and R.J. Hunter hitting the game winning three-pointer, respectively, while R. J. Hunter was the most talked about player in the tournament. Stories were run in local and national media, having interviews with Ron and R. J., as well as articles on the trainer that helped Ron up after his fall from the stool after he fell, and the reaction to R. J.'s game winning shot of the Georgia State men's golf team.\nAfter arriving back in Atlanta, it was reported that Hunter would meet with the Athletic Department of Georgia State to plan for ways to keep Georgia State at a high level in basketball, and also to negotiate Hunter's contract. It was later reported that Hunter had negotiated raises for his assistant coaches, and put pressure on the administration to begin the process of building a practice facility for the basketball team and improving the Sports Arena for the coming season. It was later reported that Ron and R. J. would join the Turner Sports broadcast team as guest analysts in their Atlanta studio during the following weeks games.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Conference Games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Sun Belt tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Australian cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2014–15",
        "text": "Australia cricket team toured the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 5 October to 3 November 2014 and played one Twenty20 International (T20I), three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Test matches against Pakistan. The series was played in the UAE owing to ongoing security concerns in Pakistan. The limited over matches were dominated by Australia while a rampant Pakistan whitewashed the Test series.\nT20I series.\nOnly T20I.\nIn Aaron Finch's debut match as captain Australia restricted Pakistan to an ordinary 96/9 on a slow turner with Glenn Maxwell (3/13 off 3 overs) and debutant Cameron Boyce (2/10 off 4 overs) being the chief wicket takers. Australia's reply got off to a shaky start, at one point 56/4 but David Warner (54*) steadied the innings, eventually comfortably winning the game by 6 wickets.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nAaron Finch (0) was caught first ball after slicing a ball to Ahmed Shehzad at point. But David Warner (43) and Steve Smith (101) put on an 86 run partnership to steady the tourists. Australia ended up with 255/8 with Steve Smith scoring his maiden ODI century. Shahid Afridi (3/46) was the best bowler for Pakistan. In response, Australia bowled very well as Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals with no batsmen scoring over 43. Mitchell Johnson (3/24) was the main wicket taker for Australia. In an unusual side note, Fawad Alam caused minor controversy mostly on social media when he bowled with his cap facing backwards.\n2nd ODI.\nPakistan made the perfect start to their innings with a steady 126 run opening partnership between Ahmed Shehzad (61) and Sarfraz Ahmed (65). But after both openers went in quick succession Pakistan collapsed to 215 (49.3 overs) with Mitchell Johnson continuing his form from the last match taking 3/40. In reply, Australia lost early wickets but steadied and reached the target with 40 balls remaining. Glenn Maxwell was their top run scorer with a quick knock of 76.\n3rd ODI.\nAustralia elected to rest Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon. Steve Smith yet again starred with the bat with a patient 77 off 105 balls. David Warner (56) also chipped in to record his first half century of the series. Sohail Tanvir (3/40) was the main wicket taker for Pakistan. In reply, Pakistan seemed to have the match all but won when they needed 2 runs of the final over but Glenn Maxwell (2/41) completed a double wicket maiden earning him man of the match honors. Steve Smith's catch to dismiss Fawad Alam was controversial: Smith lined up at slip, and began moving towards the leg side after the ball was delivered but before it was hit, before taking the catch off Fawad's sweep shot at leg slip; the umpires had the discretion under the laws of the game to declare it a dead ball if they believed Smith's movement was unfair, but they decided it was fair and gave Fawad out, which some commentators disagreed with.\nIn addition to clean sweeping the series, Australia regained the number 1 ranking for ODIs.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nPakistan won the toss and chose to bat in what was tipped to be a pitch that would gradually deteriorate. Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle removed the Pakistani openers, Mohammad Hafeez (0) and Ahmed Shehzad (3), in the first few overs. However, Pakistan steadied to end the day at 219/4 with Younus Khan hitting 106 off 223 balls. Mitchell Johnson did the bulk of the damage with an economical 3/22 off 20 overs on a slow and attritional day.\nOn the second day, Pakistan slowly began to accelerate with Sarfraz Ahmed (109) scoring his second century in Tests at over a-run-a-ball. Australia's reply began well with David Warner reaching his fifty. They ended the day at a solid 113/0.\nAustralia began their innings slowly on day three and struggled against Pakistan's inexperienced bowling attack, getting bowled out for 303, with debutant Yasir Shah (3/66) the pick of the bowlers while David Warner scored completed his century (133). The match was called off due to bad light at the end of the day with 2 overs remaining.\nAustralian debutant Stephen O'Keefe took the early wicket of Azhar Ali (30) early on day 4. But Pakistan dominated and eventually declared their innings at 286/2. Australia's second innings began well, but the spinners took quick wickets to leave Australia in trouble at 59/4 at the end of day 4.\nAustralia lost 3 wickets in the first session with Zulfiqar Babar doing most of the damage on day five. Australia managed to grind their way to the final session but succumbed to a 221 run defeat. He took his maiden five-wicket haul in the second Australian innings. Johnson (61) and Steve Smith (55) were Australia's top scorers. Khan's twin centuries in the match earned him the man of the match award.\n2nd Test.\nPakistan opted to have an unchanged team after they won the toss and decided to bat. Australia made two changes, with Alex Doolan replaced by Glenn Maxwell for his third test and Stephen O'Keefe replaced by Mitchell Starc. On another flat deck Pakistan made excellent progress with only two wickets, those of the openers Ahmed Shehzad (35) and Mohammad Hafeez (45), falling on day 1. At stumps, they were 304/2, with Younus Khan (111*) scoring his third consecutive century, and Azhar Ali (101*) was the other centurion. Mitchell Johnson (1/50) and Nathan Lyon (1/86) both took a wicket each. Due to bad light, play was suspended with 2 overs still to be bowled. Michael Clarke's unusual field positions, particularly placing Johnson at straight hit (behind the beginning of the bowler's run-up) were criticized by some commentators as not being in the \"spirit of the game\".\nWithin the first hour of the second day Australia finally struck with Starc taking the wicket of Azhar (109) caught by replacement wicket-keeper David Warner after Brad Haddin injured his right shoulder in a catching attempt. Pakistan continued to subdue the Australians finishing at 405/3 at lunch on an extended first session. Pakistan continued to pile on the runs in the second session with Younus reaching his double century and captain Misbah-ul-Haq (101) getting his century. Pakistan made accelerated in the third session, scoring some quick runs before declaring at a massive 570/6. Starc was the top wicket-taker with 2/86 (27 overs). Australia had to negotiate 5.2 overs before bad light stopped play, ending the day at 22/1.\nMost of Australia's batsmen started well but they lost wickets at regular intervals on day 3 before finishing at a modest 261 all out just after tea. Mitchell Marsh top scored for Australia with 87. All of the Pakistani bowlers took wickets with Imran Khan (3/60) taking the most wickets. Pakistan led by 307 runs, but did not enforce the follow-on. Johnson removed the openers early in the innings and Pakistan finished at 61/2 before bad light once again stopped play.\nPakistan continued their dominance in the first session of day 4 scoring 149 runs with the loss of one wicket, that of Younus (46). Misbah smashed a 21 ball fifty that broke the record for the fastest fifty in Test cricket beating Jacques Kallis's 24 ball effort. After lunch, Maxwell took over the wicket-keeping role while Misbah (101*) equaled the fastest century in Tests with Sir Vivian Richards, coming from 56 deliveries. Azhar (100*) also completed his ton shortly after and Pakistan declared. Zulfiqar Babar took two Australian wickets before tea, those of Chris Rogers (2) and Maxwell (4). Pakistan took three more wickets before the close of play, with Steve Smith (38*) and Marsh (26*) still at the crease.\nSmith and Marsh extended their partnership in the first session on day 5 until Marsh was caught at leg slip for 47. Smith continued to bat steadily as Australia reached 238/5 at lunch. But Smith was sent lbw by Yasir Shah for 97 second ball after lunch and Australia collapsed, losing their final five wickets just for eight runs. Pakistan won the series 2–0, their first series win against Australia since 1994. Zulfiqar was the best of the bowlers, taking his second five-wicket haul of the series (5/120 of 32.2 overs). Misbah was awarded the man of the match for his record-breaking century."

The first one, featuring a little girl named Kim Min rolling a hoop across the main stadium to actor Jang Dong-Gun who in turn gave the hoop back to her,in a act that remembered the 1988 Summer Olympics opening and closing ceremonies,the “Hoop Boy and Girls” performances. Kim is a young rhythmic gymnast attending Incheon Cheongil Primary School who hoped to represent Korea in the 2020 Summer Olympics. She was later joined by 44 other hoop-rolling children from various schools to represent the 45 participating nations of the games as well as the population of the Asian continent of 4.5 billion. In the second one, a few women dancers in traditional costume gathered at the center of the stage to form Cheongsachorong, a traditional Korean lantern to mark the arrival of notable guests including Park Geun-hye, then the President of South Korea. The third performance featured soprano Sumi Jo who sang \"The Song of the Asiad,\" dedicated by poet Ko Un, along with Incheon Metropolitan Citizens Choir, a choir consisting of 919 residents of the host city symbolising the event's opening date. The performance was composed by Kim Youngdong, a representative composer for traditional music of Korea. At the end of the performance, Sumi Jo sang the Korean traditional folk song Arirang with 10-vocalist choir. Before the start of the main performance, a video of the 2014 Asian Games torch relay was played with British band Coldplay's single, Viva la Vida as background music.\nMain event.\nThe cultural performance covered four sections that tells the story about Asia, which were \"Asia a long time ago\", \"Asia, connected through sea routes\", \"Asia becoming family and friends\", and \"One Asia the future we meet today\". South Korean actors Jang Dong-gun and main cast of My Love from the Star, Kim Soo-hyun led the stories, with Jang narrating the first story and Kim appearing through a video during the second stage. Section one \"Asia a long time ago\" tells about the beginning of Asia, which was built upon one continuous land and people live peacefully as a part of nature together with other living things such as trees, animals, plants and flowers. After sometime, the continent is being separated alongside its people and natural beings. Section two \"Asia, connected through sea routes\" started with a footage about Girl on a Ship, Sim Cheong a devoted daughter in a fairy tale who sacrificed herself by jumping into the sea to become a sacrifice to sea-god and rescue her blind father. This was follow by a second footage, featuring the hoop girl, Kim earlier aboard the ship with Kim Soo-hyun and travel to all parts of Asia to meet the different people around the continent and take them together to visit Incheon. Five musical artists Ock Joo-hyun, Michael K. Lee, Cha Ji-Yeon, Yang Joon-Mo and Jung Sung-hwa performing \"We meet again\" while the second footage was playing. In section three \"Asia becoming family and friends\", Prince Biryu, a founder of an ancient nation in the port city of Incheon thousands of years ago and Sim Cheong meet together in modern Incheon and witness the scenery and infrastructure of the city such as mail services, telephone services, rail transport system, airport, bridges, buildings, Incheon Asiad sports complex and seaport. During section four \"One Asia the future we meet today\", Ahn Sook-sun, Prince Biryu, Sim Cheong and the people of Incheon welcome home the ship that arrive to Incheon carrying Kim Min, Kim-Soo Hyun and the different people from all parts of Asia. The Sail of the ship was raised to represent hope for new future, united and modern Asia and Asia as one.\nAfter the cultural performance, eight people brought the national flag into the stadium. They are Um Hong-Gil: renowned Korean mountaineer, and the first person in Asia to climb all of the 16 highest Himalayan peaks; Seok Haekyun, heroic captain of Aden Bay; Lee Bongju, the Boston men's marathon winner in 2001; actor Hyun-bin, an honorary ambassador of Incheon 2014; ballerina Kang Sujin; Korean lawmaker Jasmine Lee, the first non-ethnic Assembly member; professional golfer Park Seri, the youngest golfer being inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on the LPGA Tour; and finally, Lim Chun-ae, the triple gold medal winning middle distance runner at the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul. The flag was raised by the military personnel to the South Korean national anthem.\nThe Parade of Nations was conducted in Korean alphabetical order, hence the order began with Nepal and ended with host South Korea. All 45 national delegations participated in the parade and each of them were led by an official wearing a dress decorated with their country's natural symbols. Then, Kim Young-soo, the games' organising committee chairman and Olympic Council of Asia chairman Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah gave their respective speeches and President of South Korea, Park Geun-hye declared the games open.\nAnother eight people brought the Flag of the games' governing body Olympic Council of Asia into the stadium. They are Ha Hyungjoo, a golden medalist for Judo at the 1984 Summer Olympics; Yoon Kyungshin, a handball player, who participated in the Asian Games five times and won five golden medals; badminton star Park Joobong, who is listed in Guinness World Record with 72 victories in international Championships; Yeo Hongchulpp, a golden medalist for gymnastics in the 1998 Asian Games; Baek Okja, a golden medalist in the shot put at the 1970 Asian Games; Hyeon Jeonghwa, who garnered a Grand Slam of international table-tennis Championships; Shin Junghee, the first Korean female to become international judge, a chair for athletes in Korean Olympic Committee; and Jang Miran, the first golden medalist for South Korea in weightlifting. The flag was raised by the military personnel to the Olympic Council of Asia Hymn. Archer Oh Jinhyek and fencer Nam Hyunhee took the athletes' oath, while judges, representing the sports of hockey and rhythmic gymnastics Kim Honglae and Suh Heajung took the judges' oath.\nSouth Korean K-Pop artist group JYJ consists of Kim Jae-joong, Yoochun and Junsu, performing a medley of few of their singles including \"Only One\", the games' official theme song, \"Flame\" and their hit \"Empty\" during the torch relay section. The torch was relayed into the stadium by Lee Seungyeop, 'a Korean baseball hitter'; professional golfer, Park Inbee; speed skater Lee Kyouhyuk; basketball legend Park Chansook; and tennis pioneer, Lee Hyungtaik. South Korean actress, Lee Young Ae the main cast of Dae Jang Geum climb to the top of the stadium to light up the cauldron accompanied by young diving talent Kim Young-ho and young gymnast Kim Joo-won and aerial fireworks were released all over the stadium to mark the start of the games. The ceremony concludes with Psy performing a funky remake of \"Champion,\" one of his early favourites singles, alongside Chinese pianist Lang Lang and global hit song at the time, \"Gangnam Style\". (Since 24 November 2012, Gangnam Style's music video was the most-viewed YouTube video until it was overtaken by Wiz Khalifa's \"See You Again\" on 10 July 2017.)\nParade of Nations.\nDuring the Parade of Nations, athletes and officials from each participating country paraded in the Stadium preceded by their flag. Each flag bearer had been chosen either by the nation's National Olympic Committee or by the athletes themselves.\nBelow is a list of national flagbearers during the ceremony. The nations entered in alphabetic order of their country names in Korean. Whilst most countries entered under their short names, a few entered under more formal or alternative names, mostly due to political disputes. The Republic of China (commonly known as Taiwan) entered with the compromised name and flag of \"Chinese Taipei\", using an English transliteration of the name (차이니스 타이페이 \"Chainiseu Taibei\") to avoid translation issues.\nThe two Koreas entered separately, in contrast to the 2002 Asian Games (when host South Korea marched together with North Korea last). A few minor discrepancies also occurred:"

        "title": "Titan (esports)",
        "text": "Titan was a professional esports organization founded in September 2013. Titan formerly sponsored teams in \"\", \"Dota 2\", \"Quake Live\", and \"Smite\". CEO and founder Damien Grust announced the organisation's dissolution on 13 January 2016, citing financial issues.\n\"Dota 2\".\nTitan started its \"Dota 2\" team in 2013 by recruiting four players from Orange Esports, Lee \"KyXy\" Kong Yang, Lim \"Net\" Wai Pern, Joel \"Xtinct\" Chan and Chong \"Ohaiyo\" Xin Khoo, in addition to Chua \"Ice\" Chee Cai.\nAlthough the team secured a podium finish at Mineski Pro Gaming League, in December 2013 Ice was dismissed from the team, being replaced first by Singaporean carry player Gavin ‘Meracle’ Kang and then Malaysian player Ng Wei \"NWP\" Poong (formerly known as \"Yamateh\").\nThe team went on to win the Asian Cyber Games 2013 and finished 9th/10th place at The International 4 in 2014.\nIn October 2014, the Titan Dota 2 team was disbanded and the division was officially put on hold. Most of the players went on to join the newly formed Team Malaysia.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nIn January 2014, Titan formed a CS:GO team by recruiting the VeryGames team of Kévin \"Ex6TenZ\" Droolans, Nathan \"NBK\" Schmitt, Edouard \"SmithZz\" Dubourdeaux, Adil \"ScreaM\" Benrlitom, and Richard \"shox\" Papillon. The team went on to win the February 2014 DreamHack Invitational tournament, defeating their rivals Ninjas in Pyjamas. With Copenhagen Games 2014 the first LAN to do groups based on world rankings, Titan was ranked as the second best team in the world, but failed to deliver at the event.\nThe team's lineup changed in May 2014, with the departure of shox and the arrival of Kenny \"kennyS\" Schrub. Following the change, the team did poorly, although they took second place at Gfinity 3 in August 2014.\nIn September 2014, the roster was restructured again. Only Ex6TenZ and kennyS were retained, and they were joined by three players from Team LDLC: Dan \"apEX\" Madesclaire, Mathieu \"Maniac\" Quiquerez and Hovik \"KQLY\" Tovmassian. The new lineup then went on to win the DreamHack Stockholm Invitational in Globen, taking down parts of their former teammates in LDLC. KennyS was also singled out as \"the best Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player in the world\" by CS:GO analyst Duncan \"Thorin\" Shields, with the team being ranked as no. 5 on his Top 10 World Ranking list leading up to DreamHack Winter 2014.\nIn November 2014, Hovik \"KQLY\" Tovmassian was dismissed from the team after receiving a VAC ban, with returning CS:S player Cédric \"RpK\" Guipouy taking his place. Also returning but in July 2015 would be previous Titan team members shox and SmithZz, replacing the two exiting players apEX and kennyS. In September 2015 Maniac, another longtime member, left the team, making room for yet another returning player, ScreaM.\nHowever, on 13 January 2016, Titan's Founder and CEO Damien Grust issued a statement from its official website stating that they do not possess the revenue to keep supporting their CS:GO division and that they would disband.\n\"From then on it was a real uphill battle and I forced myself to reinvest into Titan in order to keep the company afloat for at least one more year, believing that we could make it after all. We fought the entire year, trying to secure sponsorships that would enable us to keep a struggling, but great CS:GO team as well as our SMITE team. We also sought advice from agencies and lawyers to maybe even sell shares in the company, or merge with another one. None of these scenarios ever materialised with any of the potential partners we spoke to.\nHere we are now, starting 2016 without a budget high enough to keep a CS:GO team or pay our amazing staff. How profoundly sad.\"\n\"Smite\".\nIn December 2014 Titan expanded its esports presence by recruiting Aquila, securing the lineup of Nate “Ataraxia” Mark, Andreas “KanyeLife” Christmansson, Emil “PrettyPriMe” Edström, Thomas “Repikas” Skallebaek, and Kevin “Confrey” Confrey.\nFounded as Agilitas at the start of the Smite Pro league qualifier in 2013, the team had stayed largely intact since its inception, adding manager Job “CaptCoach” Hilbers and analyst Erik “Omgimabird” Sjösten as support staff.\nPlaying their way through the Smite Challenger Cup and placing 1st seven weeks in a row, the team ended 2014 by winning the Smite European Regionals after a 2-0 clean sweep against SK Gaming in the finals. In the following 2015 Smite World Championship tournament the team managed to beat Oh My God and SK Gaming, with Titan taking an impressive second place after losing 2–3 to the home soil lineup of Cognitive Prime in the grand final.\nIn August 2015 Job “CaptCoach” Hilbers left the team in search for new challenges, and the following month saw the team part ways with Kevin “Confrey” Confrey, being replaced by the up-and-coming talent of Nicklas \"Brotuz\" Petersen.\nOn 12 January 2016, Titan's Smite division dissolved due to the departure of the current Titan SMITE roster. It would only be a mere day later that Titan's CSGO division followed suite and was shut down, along with the rest of Titan.\n\"The departure from Titan also signals the end of the current roster, with parts of the Thomas \"Repikas\" Skallebaek, Nicklas \"Brotuz\" Petersen, Nate \"Ataraxia\" Mark, Emil \"PrettyPriMe\" Edström and Andreas \"KanyeLife\" Christmansson lineup going their separate ways.\""

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics took place at Henley-on-Thames, London, United Kingdom. The event was held from 5 to 9 August. There were 14 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Mervyn Wood of Australia, the nation's third victory in four Games (Bobby Pearce had won in 1928 and 1932). Eduardo Risso's silver was Uruguay's second medal in the event, after a bronze in 1932. Italy received its first men's single sculls medal with Romolo Catasta's bronze. The United States had its five-Games podium streak in the event ended, as John B. Kelly Jr. lost his semifinal by 0.4 seconds and did not advance to the final.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nNone of the 20 single scullers from the pre-war 1936 Games returned, though Australia's Mervyn Wood had been on the eight team. The three post-war Diamond Challenge Sculls champions were all competing: Wood (1948) was the reigning winner, with Jean Séphériadès of France (1946) and John B. Kelly Jr. of the United States (1947) the previous title holders. Séphériadès was also the 1947 European champion. Kelly was the son of 1920 Olympic champion John B. Kelly Sr. (who had famously been excluded from the Diamond Challenge Sculls).\nEgypt and Greece each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its ninth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe venue, Henley-on-Thames, imposed certain restrictions and modifications to the format. The course could handle only three boats at a time (and this required expansion of the typical Henley course), so the six-boat final introduced in 1936 was not possible this time. The course distance was also modified; instead of either the 2000 metres distance that was standard for the Olympics or the 1 mile 550 yards (2112 metres) standard at Henley, a course that was somewhat shorter than either was used. Sources disagree on the exact distance: 1929 metres is listed by the Official Report, though other sources say 1850 metres.\nThe format was largely similar to the 1936 Games, though with the three-boats-per-race limit. There were four rounds: quarterfinals, a repechage, semifinals, and a final.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first rower in each heat advanced directly to the semifinals. The others competed again in the repechage for remaining spots in the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 5.\nNo official time was recorded in this heat.\nRepechage.\nThe winner of each race advanced to the semifinals; the other rowers are eliminated.\nSemifinals.\nThe winner of each race advanced to the final."

        "text": "Noah Rubin (born February 21, 1996) is an American professional tennis player. He is a former Wimbledon junior singles champion, and a former USTA junior national champion in both singles and doubles. After turning pro in 2015, he won four ATP Challenger titles.\nRubin also played college tennis for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the 2014–15 season. Entering the year as the ITA No. 1 ranked college freshman, he finished the season as an All-American and the runner-up in the 2015 NCAA singles championship.\nDespite only peaking at No. 125 in the world, Rubin became a notable player on the tour for his efforts to advocate for mental health awareness on the ATP Tour and greater pay for lower-ranked professional players.\nIn October 2022, Rubin announced he would retire from tennis and pursue a career as a professional pickleball player. Following limited success on the pickleball tour, he returned to professional tennis in January 2024.\nEarly life and education.\nRubin is Jewish, and his bar mitzvah had a tennis theme. He attended the Merrick Jewish Center religious school, and collected donated tennis rackets for the Israel Tennis Centers as his mitzvah project. He has said, \"I want people to know I'm Jewish and I like to represent the Jewish people.\"\nHis father Eric Rubin works as a banker, and his mother Melanie is an educator. His father was the top player on the tennis team at Martin Van Buren High School in Queens. As a junior, Noah was coached by his father and Lawrence Kleger. His older sister Jessie was captain of the Binghamton University tennis team.\nHe has lived in Rockville Centre and Merrick, New York. He attended Levy-Lakeside Elementary School and Merrick Avenue Middle School, and then went to John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, Long Island for one year, after which he studied via an online program at the Laurel Springs School, graduating in 2014.\nJunior career.\nRubin played for the John McEnroe Tennis Academy on Randalls Island in Manhattan. By the age of seven, Rubin was competing in 12-and-under events, and he was winning international competitions by the time he was eleven. In 2010, he made it to the finals at Les Petits As in Tarbes, France. In 2011, when Rubin was 15, John McEnroe called him \"the most talented player we've come across.\" He also won the Copa Del Café, a Junior ITF tournament in Costa Rica, in 2012.\nAs a junior, Rubin reached as high as no. 6 in the International Tennis Federation's world junior ranking and no. 1 in the United States in 2014.\nHe qualified for the boys' singles tournament at Wimbledon in July 2014, and won the tournament in the first all-American final there since 1977. He was the first American boy to win Wimbledon since Donald Young in 2007. He had played only one other event in 2014 before Wimbledon at the French Open, where he lost in the second round.\nThe month after hoisting the trophy at Wimbledon, Rubin played in and won the 2014 U.S. Tennis Association's Boys 18s National Championships in both singles and doubles (with close friend Stefan Kozlov). The latter success came with two big bonuses of main-draw wild cards into the singles and doubles events at the US Open.\nCollege career.\nRubin attended and played tennis for Wake Forest University in North Carolina, where part of his schedule was to play pro events. His scholarship there allowed him to leave the university after one year and return at any time to complete his degree. In September 2014, Rubin was ranked the No. 1 Division 1 college freshman by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA).\nRubin ended his 2014–15 freshman season with a 26–4 record, mostly playing no. 1 singles, and ranked no. 5 in the U.S. He was the first player in Atlantic Coast Conference history to be named both men's tennis ACC Player and Freshman of the Year in his freshman season, and was the first Wake Forest ACC men's tennis Player of the Year, and the third to win Freshman of the Year. He was an All-American, ITA Rookie of the Year, four-time ACC Player of the Week, and ITA Carolina Region Rookie of the Year. Playing doubles mostly with Jon Ho at No. 2 doubles, he had a 15–6 record. He lost in the finals of the 2015 NCAA singles championship to Ryan Shane.\nProfessional career.\n2015–2016.\nRubin turned pro in June 2015 at the age of 19. He made his first final on the ATP Challenger Tour at Charlottesville, and won by defeating fellow American teenager Tommy Paul, despite being down 5–1 in the second set with Paul serving for the match. As the only American to win an event in the Australian Open Wild Card Challenge, Rubin was awarded a wild card into the main draw at the Australian Open. With his wild card, Rubin entered his second career Grand Slam event as the lowest-ranked non-PR player (328th overall) in the main draw of the 2016 Australian Open, where he beat the 17th-seeded Benoit Paire in three tiebreaks in the first round.\nRubin cracked the Top 200 for the first time by qualifying for the 2016 Indian Wells Masters tournament. In the clay court season, he recorded an upset win over 59th-ranked Denis Kudla, the No. 1 seed at the Sarasota Open. Having missed most of the summer tournaments due to a rolled ankle injury he suffered while jogging in June that cost him five months of training and competition, Rubin returned to form in October, reaching his second career Challenger final at Stockton.\n2017–2018.\nRubin started the 2017 season by winning his first round match at the Australian Open, before falling to eventual champion Roger Federer in the second round. He then went back to Australia and won his second Challenger title at Launceston, Tasmania, in an all-American final against Mitchell Krueger. For the second consecutive year, Rubin missed a few consecutive months of the late spring and early summer due to injury; this one a severely sprained right wrist that he suffered in April when he slipped on a clay court during a tournament in Houston that resulted in him losing 10 months of serious competition and training. He bounced back near the end of the season to finish the year on the cusp of the Top 200, just as in 2016.\nOnce again, Rubin began the 2018 season by playing at the BNP Paribas de Nouvelle-Calédonie. At this tournament, he greatly improved on his second-round result from the previous year and reached his fourth Challenger final, all four of which have been against other Americans. In the final, Rubin defeated Taylor Fritz to claim his third Challenger title to boost himself to a new career-high ranking of No. 162 in the world. After falling out of the Top 200, Rubin won a fourth Challenger title at the Tallahassee Tennis Challenger. This was his first title on clay and put him back in the Top 200 of the ATP rankings. The title also helped him clinch the French Open Wild Card Challenge to earn a wild card into the main draw of the French Open. In his debut at the tournament, he was beaten by compatriot John Isner.\n2019–2022.\nRubin played in the main draw of the 2021 Winston-Salem Open as a lucky loser. He lost 6–2, 6–0 to former world No. 1 Andy Murray. Rubin defeated top seed Ernesto Escobedo in the first round of qualifying at the 2022 Hall of Fame Open, but lost in the final round of qualifying to William Blumberg. His last career professional match was in the 2022 Citi Open where he lost 6–2, 6–0 to Taro Daniel in the first round of qualifying.\nOn September 19, 2022, Rubin, in an Instagram post announced he would be taking an indefinite break from professional tennis. Rubin stated that he was unhappy with his current level of play and sustained a wrist injury that may have required surgery if he wanted to continue playing at a professional level. In the post, Rubin did not rule out returning to professional tennis, but he stated he will be involved with a number of endeavors including \"documentaries, clothing lines [and] clubs.\" In October 2022, Rubin announced he would become a professional pickleball player.\nPersonal life.\nRubin's hobbies are photography, soccer, and art. Rubin has an Instagram account that has met with “modest success,” Behind the Racquet, where players share personal struggles of living on the professional tour.

        "title": "Cycling at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race",
        "text": "The men's individual road race at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, was held on 30 August 1960. There were 142 participants from 42 nations. Each nation could enter up to four cyclists. Of the 142 starters 76 rode the distance to the end. The event was won by Viktor Kapitonov of the Soviet Union, the nation's first medal in the event. Livio Trapè of Italy took silver, putting that country on the podium for the second consecutive Games. Willy Vanden Berghen's bronze gave Belgium its fourth medal in four Games (one in 1948, two in 1952, none in 1956).\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). The favorites were the German riders Gustav-Adolf Schur (1958 and 1959 world champion) and Bernhard Eckstein (1960 world champion).\nFor the first time since the reintroduction of the event in 1936, there was no corresponding team event (it had been replaced by a separate team time trial). The Danish riders entered in the individual event withdrew after the death of Knud Enemark Jensen in the team time trial. \nThe British West Indies, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and Tunisia each made their debut in the men's individual road race; East and West Germany competed as the United Team of Germany. Great Britain made its sixth appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a course that covered 12 laps of a 14.615 kilometres circuit known as the \"Grottarossa Circuit,\" for a total of 175.38 kilometres. The course ran along the Via Flaminia, the Via Di Grottarossa, and the Via Cassia. Each lap included \"a slightly steep climb, and a series of switchbacks, just after the 6 km. point, and then ascended gently for the next 2½ km.\"\nSchedule.\nThe day was hot, despite the morning start, with temperatures at 38 degrees Celsius. \nResults.\nThe first break was by van Kreuningen in lap 2. He led by himself until lap 5 when his teammate Hugens joined him. In lap 7, however, the pair was caught by a pack of seven cyclists. Additional cyclists moved up into the lead group in laps 7 and 8. The next significant breakaway from that bunch was by Trapè and Kapitonov in lap 10. Kapitonov broke into a sprint to finish lap 11, apparently confused as to how many laps had been completed. Trapè caught up to him, with a large (39 cyclists) chase pack bearing down on the pair in the actual final lap, lap 12. Kapitonov successfully repeated his sprint to beat Trapè, and the chase pack ultimately did not come within 20 seconds of the pair.\nThe Official Report lists only the finishers, requiring historians to put together a list of non-finishers from other sources. Further, the finish-line judge left to have lunch and the placement of the finishers is suspect based on photographs and personal reports from the cyclists."

        "text": "Michael Brandon Roll (born April 12, 1987) is an American-born naturalized Tunisian professional basketball player who last played for US Monastir. Born in America, he joined the Tunisia national basketball team after becoming a naturalized citizen in 2015.\nRoll played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, who reached the Final Four three times in four NCAA tournament appearances during his tenure. Roll was the Bruins leading scorer in his final season in 2009–10, when he earned all-conference honors in the Pacific-10. He has played professionally in Turkey, Belgium, Spain, Israel, Italy, and France.\nEarly life.\nRoll was born in Mission Viejo, California, to Richard and Joyce Roll. He played basketball at Aliso Niguel High School, where as a senior he was named the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section Division I-A Player of the Year. That season, he averaged almost 25 points per game while leading the Wolverines over top-seeded Lake Forest El Toro in the Division I-A title game.\nRanked as the No. 1 shooting guard in the West by Scout.com, Roll originally gave a verbal, non-binding, commitment to attend college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before he changed to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman for UCLA in 2005–06, Roll played on a 32–7 Bruins team that lost in the 2006 national championship to Florida. Though he played behind Arron Afflalo and Cedric Bozeman that season, Roll averaged 15 minutes per game, and UCLA coach Ben Howland called him \"an important contributor.\" The following season, he played behind Afflalo and Josh Shipp while UCLA returned to the Final Four. As a junior, he was bypassed for a starting position by sophomore Russell Westbrook. UCLA again reached the Final Four, but Roll's season had ended prematurely after he ruptured his left plantar fascia. However, he was granted a medical redshirt, earning another year of eligibility to effectively remain a junior. He returned the following season, but continued as a role player behind Shipp and freshman Jrue Holiday. Roll and the Bruins again qualified for the NCAA Tournament, but were eliminated in the round of 32.\nAfter years of being a role player for the Bruins, Roll became a leader of the team as a fifth-year senior in 2009–10. He was pushed into his new role after the departure of seniors Shipp, Darren Collison, and Alfred Aboya from the prior season. Moreover, he would have been only the fourth option on the team behind Kevin Love, Westbrook, and Holiday, had they not declared early for the National Basketball Association. Roll prepared for the increased workload during the offseason with a workout regimen that included basketball workouts twice a day, ball-handling drills, shooting 500 times daily, and a weight-training program to strengthen his legs and back. UCLA's roster that season included six freshmen and six sophomores. Roll, Nikola Dragović, and James Keefe were the only seniors on the team, and Keefe's season ended prematurely after season-ending shoulder surgery. UCLA's season ended in the semifinals of the 2010 Pacific-10 Conference tournament with an 85–72 loss to California, despite a career-high 27 points from Roll. He averaged 22.5 points in the two tournament games, and was named to the All-Tournament team. The Bruins finished the season 14-18 and did not qualify for the NCAA tournament for the first time in six seasons. Roll earned first team All-Pac-10 honors, and was named the Bruins' most valuable player after leading the team in scoring with 14.1 points per game. He also led UCLA with 3.6 assists per game, and set the school record for most career games played (147), surpassing Collison and Aboya's previous mark (142). Roll was selected to play in the Reese's College All-Star Game during the Final Four.\nProfessional career.\nBornova Belediye (2010–2011).\nAfter going undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft, Roll joined the Toronto Raptors for the 2010 NBA Summer League.

On July 3, 2017 following Roll's signing with Israeli basketball club Maccabi Tel Aviv, Ali Benzarti, president of the Tunisian Basketball Federation (FTBB), announced that Roll would not be on the Tunisian national team \"for now\" because of his recent integration with a team in the Israeli League. Relations between Tunisia and Israel have been stressed since the Second Intifada of 2000. After leaving Maccabi in July 2019, Roll once again joined Tunisia national team, becoming a member of the squad representing Tunisia at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup."

He plays as a tight head prop for the Melbourne Rebels in Super Rugby and has represented in international rugby. Born in Tonga he qualifies for Australia by residency.\nEarly life and career.\nTupou became known as a schoolboy rugby player. While playing for Auckland’s Sacred Heart College First XV in 2014, he became an internet sensation for his three tries against Kelston Boys High School, earning him the nickname \"Tongan Thor\".\nOn 22 June 2014, he was named in the Pacific Barbarians squad, captained by All Black legend Justin Marshall, to play Tonga during the 2014 mid-year rugby union internationals. Tonga won the match 36–14 at Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland.\nThe following month Tupou was given a deadline to sign a loyalty agreement to be eligible for the New Zealand Schoolboys team. However, he declined the offer. Despite interest from rugby clubs in France and England as well as New Zealand Super Rugby franchises Chiefs and Blues, Tupou's desire to play for the Wallabies lured him to Australia where his brother, Criff Tupou, resided.\nMichael Cheika, head coach of the New South Wales Waratahs commented that he had an eye on Tupou well before he emerged on television with his three-try effort, but on 12 September 2014 Tupou was officially named in the Queensland Reds squad for the 2015 season.\nRugby career.\nTupou played his first game for the Brothers Old Boys club in 2015, in a trial match alongside his 25-year-old brother Criff Tupou. After completing the full 2015 season in Queensland Premier Rugby with Brothers, he joined Queensland Country to play in the National Rugby Championship.\nAfter playing for Queensland Under-20 in 2016, he made his debut for the Reds in 2016. Tupou toured as a development player in the Australian national squad for the 2016 Wallabies tour. His strong NRC form for Queensland Country the following year led to his international debut for the Wallabies against at Murrayfield on 24 November 2017."

He played for the Kentucky Colonels during the 1967–68 ABA season after a collegiate career at East Tennessee State University (ETSU). He also played internationally for a time after his one season in the ABA.\nCareer.\nWoods was a racial integration pioneer in college. When he enrolled at ETSU as a freshman in 1963–64 to play basketball, he became the first African-American player in school history. In a segregated southern United States, Woods was harshly booed early in his college career. His final three seasons from 1964 to 1967, in which he was eligible to play for the varsity team, saw Woods have an ETSU Hall of Fame career. He was a two-time All-Ohio Valley Conference Team selection and set still-unbroken school records for rebounds in a game (38), career (1,034) and career per-game average (16.2). By the end of his career, the same fans who had been booing him as a freshman were giving him \"loudest and longest\" standing ovation on senior night that a local reporter had ever seen.\nAfter college, Woods played in the American Basketball Association for the Kentucky Colonels for one season. After a brief stint playing internationally, he retired due to an injury. Woods then served as a police officer in Louisville, Kentucky for the next 30-plus years. In 1996, ETSU inducted him into their hall of fame. On November 3, 2012, in a ceremony prior to the school's 2012–13 season, the men's basketball locker room was named in his honor.\nCareer statistics.\nABA.\nSource"

For the first time ever women's boxing will be contested.\nLike all Commonwealth boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with a one-minute break between rounds. Punches scored only if the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Three judges scored each bout; the winner of the bout was the boxer who won the most rounds."

Only a few of the drawn matches came close to achieving a result. Against the Pakistanis in 1952–53, Indian Universities gained a first-innings lead of 248 after Jayasinghrao Ghorpade took 6 for 19 to dismiss the Pakistanis for 92; but rain prevented play on the final day. Against Ceylon in 1964–65, Indian Universities needed 89 to win and finished at 78 for 3 after 20 overs.\nThe one first-class match by Indian Universities that did not take place in India was against Ceylon Board President's XI in Colombo in 1970–71. Sunil Gavaskar top-scored in each innings with 30 and 76 not out, and the Ceylon team, needing 106 for victory, reached 93 for 6 in 18 overs. The Universities team also played five non-first-class matches against university teams on the short tour of Ceylon.\nA four-day match between Indian Universities and England A in 1994-95 was ruled not first-class by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, as only one of the Universities team had first-class experience. England A won by 439 runs.\nGhorpade's 6 for 19 in 1952-53 were the best figures for Indian Universities. Ambar Roy's 135 in the 1964-65 match was the highest individual score.\nTest players.\nMany Indian Universities players went on to play Test cricket. From the first side in 1949–50, for example, Nana Joshi, Pankaj Roy, Polly Umrigar, Gulabrai Ramchand, Deepak Shodhan and Subhash Gupte played Tests for India. Three of the 1970-71 side (Ashok Gandotra, Mohinder Amarnath and Budhi Kunderan) had already played Test cricket, while another four (Gavaskar, Kenia Jayantilal, Surinder Amarnath and Dilip Doshi) would later do so."

        "title": "Celtic Cup (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Celtic Cup was a rugby union cup competition featuring regional and provincial teams from Ireland, Scotland and Wales that ran for two seasons between 2003 and 2005. The first edition of the competition was won by Ulster and the second by Munster, both from Ireland. After the Welsh teams agreed to join the English Premiership clubs to form the Anglo-Welsh Cup for the 2005–06 season, the Celtic Cup was discontinued. A separate competition under the same name was inaugurated in 2018 for Welsh and Irish development sides.\nFormation.\nFollowing the inception of Welsh regional rugby ahead of the 2003–04 season, the format of the Celtic League tournament was changed so that each team would play each other twice, home and away, with the side that accumulated the most points during the season winning the title. This was a change from previous seasons, which culminated in a knock-out format competition leading to a final. In a bid to attract broadcasters, sponsors and the public by having a \"showpiece\" final, the Irish, Scottish and Welsh unions agreed to launch a new knock-out cup competition, naming it the Celtic Cup.\n2003–04 season.\nIn the inaugural season, the competition was contested by all 12 Celtic League sides and ran concurrently with the league on four weekends between September and December 2003. The tournament was a knock-out format, played over one leg with the first team drawn in each fixture hosting the match. Due to the number of teams competing, eight teams contested the first round in mid-September, while four teams (Edinburgh, Munster, Ulster and Cardiff Blues) were given byes to the quarter-finals, where they would meet the winners from the first round. The winning teams from the first round were Connacht, Glasgow, Leinster and the Llanelli Scarlets.\nThe quarter-finals took place on the first weekend of October, with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Connacht winning their games. Ulster and Leinster drew their game 23–23 after extra time, but Ulster progressed having scored three tries to Leinster's two. The semi-finals took place in mid-November and saw both the away teams win, as Ulster beat Glasgow and Edinburgh beat Connacht. The final was played at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh on 20 December 2003, and saw Ulster beat Edinburgh 27–21 to win the Celtic Cup.\n2004–05 season.\nThe format of the competition was changed for the 2004–05 season. It was moved to April and May to run after the conclusion of the Celtic League competition, and only the top eight teams from the league took part, again in a straight knockout format. The quarter-final fixtures were based on the teams' finishing positions in the Celtic League, with the league winners Neath-Swansea Ospreys hosting the eighth-placed side Ulster, second-placed Munster hosting seventh-placed Edinburgh, third-placed Leinster hosting sixth-placed Glasgow and fourth-placed Newport Gwent Dragons hosting fifth-placed Llanelli Scarlets. In this way, the tournament was similar to a play-off system, although the Celtic League and Celtic Cup remained trophies in their own right.\nRather than continuing with the automatic home advantage for the highest-seeded teams remaining in the semi-finals, the fixtures were instead decided by a draw. Munster beat Leinster in Dublin, and the Scarlets won at home to the Ospreys. The final took place on 14 May at Lansdowne Road and saw Munster beat the Scarlets 27–16 to win the second Celtic Cup.\nDemise.\nAt the end of the 2004–05 season, the Welsh regions signed a deal to join the English Premiership clubs in an Anglo-Welsh Cup competition from the 2005–06 season. With clashing fixtures in the two competitions, the fallout led to the Irish and Scottish sides withdrawing from Celtic competition at the end of May. Talks between the three countries in June led to an agreement to reinstate the Celtic League, but not the Celtic Cup.\nFor the 2009–10 season, the Celtic League adopted a play-off format similar to that used for the 2004–05 Celtic Cup, but involving the top four teams in the league at the end of the season rather than the top eight. However the Celtic Cup name was not revived and the winners of the play-offs were instead crowned the overall Celtic League champions."

        "title": "2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup",
        "text": "The 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup was the 19th tournament of the FIBA Basketball World Cup for men's national basketball teams. The tournament was the second to feature 32 teams and was hosted by multiple nations for the first time in its history—the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia—from 25 August to 10 September 2023.\nIt was the first World Cup to be hosted in Indonesia, and the second to be hosted in both the Philippines and Japan, with both having first hosted the tournament in 1978 and 2006, respectively. The tournament was also the second of three-straight World Cups to be held in Asia after China's hosting of the 2019 edition and Qatar's upcoming hosting of the 2027 tournament, and the first time in tournament history that a host nation has not qualified. It also served as qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics, in which the top two teams from each of the Americas and Europe, and the top team from each of Africa, Asia and Oceania, qualified alongside the tournament's host France.\nGermany went undefeated at the tournament to win their first title by defeating Serbia 83–77 in the final. It was the first appearance at the World Cup final for Germany, while for Serbia it would be its second in three tournaments, having appeared in the 2014 final. Canada went on to win the bronze medal, its first medal in World Cup history, after defeating the United States 127–118.\nThe tournament also set a record for the most-attended World Cup game in history, with 38,115 spectators attending the Dominican Republic vs. Philippines game at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, breaking the previous one of 32,616 set during the 1994 final at the SkyDome in Toronto. Latvia, Georgia, Cape Verde and South Sudan all made their first World Cup appearances, with Latvia placing in the top five. Co-hosts Japan qualified for the Olympics by virtue of being the best-performing Asian team, while co-hosts Philippines qualified for the 2024 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Both co-hosts registered wins in the tournament.\nThe defending champions, Spain, lost to Latvia and Canada in the second round and finished only in ninth place. This was the first time Spain missed the quarter-finals since 1994. Olympic champions United States also failed to win a medal for the second consecutive tournament.\nHost selection.\nOn 7 June 2016, FIBA approved the bidding process for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nJoint bids by member federations were also approved by the FIBA Central Board starting from the 2023 edition, and there is no restriction for a country from the confederation that hosted the previous edition to bid for the World Cup hosting rights.\nOn 1 June 2017, FIBA confirmed the list of candidates for the hosting of the World Cup.\nSolo bidders Russia and Turkey ended their bids, leaving joint bids of the Philippines–Japan–Indonesia, and Argentina–Uruguay left in the race, automatically marking the 2023 tournament as the first to be hosted by multiple nations.\nVoting results.\nOn 9 December 2017, it was announced that the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia won the bid and will host the upcoming World Cup, after Argentina and Uruguay withdrew their joint-bid on the same day, leaving FIBA to award the hosting rights via a unanimous vote.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nAs co-hosts, the Philippines and Japan each got an automatic qualification for the tournament when they were awarded joint hosting rights along with co-host Indonesia. However, Indonesia's host qualification slot was conditional, as FIBA wanted the Indonesian national team to be competitive by 2021 and thus required Indonesia to qualify for and finish in the top-eight (advance to the quarter-finals) of the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup (postponed from 2021). Indonesia officially qualified for the Asia Cup as host and advanced from the preliminary round-robin round, but lost to China in the playoff round (round of 16) and were therefore unable to secure qualification for their hoped-for FIBA Basketball World Cup debut. This is the first time in the history of the FIBA Basketball World Cup that a host nation has not qualified.\n80 teams from four FIBA zones qualified for the World Cup qualifiers through qualification for the FIBA Continental Cups (AfroBasket 2021, 2022 FIBA AmeriCup, 2022 FIBA Asia Cup, and EuroBasket 2022). For Europe and the Americas, additional teams qualified through the pre-qualifiers of the said regions. The participants of both the AfroBasket and the Asia Cup comprised the teams that also took part in the qualifiers for their respective regions. The first game of the qualifiers took place in Minsk on 25 November 2021 between Belarus and Turkey, as part of the European Qualifiers. The draw for the World Cup qualifiers was held at the Patrick Baumann House of Basketball in Mies, Switzerland, on 31 August 2021.\nThe first round of the Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Africa qualifiers featured 16 teams each, whereas Europe had 32 teams. Division A teams were split into groups of four, to be held in a home-and-away round-robin. The top three teams in each group advanced to the second round. In round two of the World Cup qualifiers, teams were split into six groups, totaling four groups in Europe and two in the other qualifiers. Teams carried over the points from round one, and faced the other three teams again in a home-and-away round-robin. The best teams in each group qualified for the World Cup. No wild card selection was held, and the Olympic champions (United States) were not guaranteed a spot in the tournament.\nThe complete field of 32 teams that participated in the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 was determined on 27 February 2023 at the conclusion of the sixth window of qualifiers.\nQualified teams.\nOn 28 August 2022, Finland and the Ivory Coast became the first teams to qualify from Europe and Africa, respectively. The following day, New Zealand became the first Asian team outside of hosts Japan and the Philippines to qualify for the tournament. Finland made their second World Cup appearance after their debut at the 2014 edition in Spain. On 10 November 2022, Canada became the first team from the Americas to qualify.\nAlongside Finland, Slovenia, Egypt, and Mexico returned to the World Cup since the 2014 edition after notably missing the 2019 tournament in China.\nLebanon returned to the World Cup after participating in the 2010 edition, while Latvia, South Sudan, and Georgia all made their FIBA Basketball World Cup debut. Cape Verde also qualified for their first World Cup, becoming the smallest nation in tournament history to qualify.\nBrazil and the United States also secured qualification for the tournament, continuing their streaks of participating in all World Cups since its inception in 1950.\nDays before the second window of the Asian Qualifiers, South Korea withdrew from the tournament due to one of its players, scheduled to join the team in its second window campaign, testing positive for COVID-19. The Korea Basketball Association made an appeal to FIBA to justify its non-appearance in the qualifiers but was rejected. As a result, South Korea failed to qualify for the World Cup after qualifying for two straight tournaments (2014 and 2019). Algeria withdrew from the tournament for similar reasons. Russia, who also participated in the 2019 World Cup, were banned from FIBA tournaments, including the World Cup and its qualifiers due to the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Belarus was also banned from FIBA tournaments and the past results of the games they played in the European Qualifiers were annulled. Mali were disqualified during qualifying by forfeiting two games.\nAfter winning the silver medal at the 2019 World Cup in China and nine consecutive appearances dating back to 1986 in Spain, reigning FIBA AmeriCup champions Argentina failed to qualify for the tournament after their defeat to the Dominican Republic in the final window of qualification. Notable countries in Africa also failed to make the World Cup, including two-time reigning AfroBasket champions Tunisia, which made the last three World Cups prior to 2023 (2010, 2014, and 2019), Senegal, which qualified for the 2014 and 2019 editions, and Nigeria, who was the lone African nation to qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIBA Men's World Ranking before the tournament were:\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 29 April 2023 at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines, at 19:30 PHT.\nFIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 Global Ambassador Luis Scola (Argentina) and 2011 NBA champion Dirk Nowitzki (Germany) led the draw ceremony, along with Local Ambassadors from the three host nations: 2014 Philippine World Cup team member LA Tenorio and Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray (Philippines), former national team member and current president of Levanga Hokkaido Takehiko Orimo (Japan), and actor Raffi Ahmad (Indonesia). American rapper and singer Saweetie and Filipino artists Billy Crawford and Sarah Geronimo performed during the draw.\nFor the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into eight pots based on the February 2023 FIBA World Rankings. The Philippines were allocated to Pot 1 as the hosts of the final stage of the tournament, alongside the three best-qualified teams: Spain, the United States, and Australia. The remaining 28 teams were allocated Pots 2 to 8 based on the February 2023 FIBA World Ranking, with co-host Japan placed in Pot 7.\nFurthermore, the three host countries were given the privilege to select a team each to host in the group stage. The United States were selected to play in the Philippines, Slovenia in Japan, and Canada in Indonesia. FIBA cites \"commercial reasons\" for the selection which it says would not affect the draw process.\nThe draw consisted of two clusters of pots. Teams in Pots 1, 3, 5, and 7 were drawn into Groups A, C, E, and G, while teams in Pots 2, 4, 6, and 8 were placed into Groups B, D, F, and H.\nTeams from confederations of Africa, Americas, Asia and Oceania would not be allowed to be drawn against other members of their confederation in the group stage. Additionally, each group contains at least one team from Europe, but no more than two. As such, it's known that Montenegro and Mexico were drawn to the same group, so were Spain and Brazil since Greece, Germany, and Italy from Pot 3 could not be drawn with Spain.\nSeeding.\nThe seeding was confirmed on 21 April 2023.\nSquads.\nEach team has a final roster of 12 players; a team can opt to have one naturalized player as per FIBA eligibility rules from its roster.\nVenues.\nThe tournament was hosted in five venues in five separate cities. Three cities in the Greater Manila Area hosted four preliminary round groups, two second round groups, and the final tournament phase from the quarter-finals onwards. Okinawa and Jakarta each hosted two preliminary round groups and one second round group. The Philippines hosted 16 teams while Japan and Indonesia hosted eight teams each.\nIn the Philippines, three venues were used for the World Cup: The Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, and the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan, all of which hosted various 2019 and 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers games of the Philippines. The Mall of Asia Arena hosted the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship, the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Manila, and the 5v5 basketball events of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. The Araneta Coliseum hosted the 1978 FIBA World Championship, while the Philippine Arena has a 55,000 seating capacity and was initially poised to host the tournament's final phase and the World Cup final. The arena also hosted the 2018 FIBA 3x3 World Cup and the opening ceremony of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.\nDuring FIBA's Central Board meeting on 28 April 2023, FIBA announced that the Mall of Asia Arena replaced the Philippine Arena as hosts of the final phase and the final, citing long distances, logistical and transport reasons. Ensuring the arena's usage in the tournament and aligning with the initial bid, the Philippine Arena hosted the first two World Cup games of Group A.\nOne venue in both Japan and Indonesia each hosted World Cup matches. The Okinawa Arena in Okinawa has a 10,000 seating capacity and is the new home arena of the Ryukyu Golden Kings of the Japanese B.League. The arena also hosted exhibition games involving the Japanese men's basketball team in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and various 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers games of Japan. Initially, the Istora Gelora Bung Karno in Jakarta was to be the venue to be used for the tournament. However, FIBA Central Board member Erick Thohir was quoted that the venue was only approved for the 2021 FIBA Asia Cup (postponed to 2022), which was also hosted by the city, but not for the World Cup. During the draw for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers on 31 August 2021, it was revealed that a new venue located at the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex would be used for the tournament. Known as Indonesia Arena, it has a seating capacity of 16,500 spectators.\nA contingency plan exists to move games from Okinawa City to Metro Manila in the case of weather disturbances such as a typhoon.\nTraining venues and hotels.\nIn the Philippines, the designated training venues for participating teams are the Rizal Memorial Coliseum and the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in Manila, the PhilSports Arena and the Meralco Gym in Pasig.

The first meeting of the board took place on the final week of May 2020.\nGovernmental support.\nIn February 2020, then-Indonesian Youth and Sports Minister revealed plans for a new arena to be built in Jakarta for the tournament, with a capacity of between 15,000 and 20,000. Indonesian President Joko Widodo granted a permit for its construction, with the Indonesian government funding the construction of the new arena for the country's hosting of the World Cup. This would be the Indonesia Arena, located within the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex. Widodo led the topping-off ceremony of the Indonesia Arena on 13 January 2023, with opening expected to be in June 2023, a few months before the start of the tournament. President Widodo and acting Governor of Jakarta Heru Budi Hartono officially inaugurated the Indonesia Arena on 7 August 2023.

According to its fictional biography, the mascot, initially unnamed, was created through the idea of three fans from the three host countries (Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia), to create \"something amazing that could unite people and represent them all.\" The mascot is a basketball robot with an LED face which allows it to connect and interact with people through its various expressions. In addition, the mascot also has a basketball hoop attached to its back as an advocacy for the importance of recycling. The red, blue, and yellow colors of the mascot represent the three colors of the national flags of the host nations. An online naming competition was held, and on 28 July 2022, it was announced the mascot's name is \"JIP,\" which is the first letter of each of the three host countries – the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia.\nBall.\nThe official ball used for the World Cup was unveiled on 29 April 2023 during the Draw Festival at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.

German-Indonesian actress Cinta Laura was also named a local ambassador for Indonesia on 11 July 2023.\nTicketing.\nPricing for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup game tickets were determined by the local organizing committees and was reviewed by FIBA.\nTicket packages or 'passes' covering multiple games were made available as early as March 2022. Single tickets were made available for purchase in July 2023.\nIn Okinawa specifically, the target ticket sales of ($6.8 million) set by the Japanese local organizing committee has been met.\nOn the last day of the tournament, FIBA concluded that attendance was lower than expected citing high ticket pricing, especially the middle tiers.\nCountdown clocks.\nThree countdown clocks were unveiled from 25 to 28 August 2022 to mark one year before the tournament. These clocks are situated at the Tenbusu Naha Plaza in Naha, Okinawa; the Selamat Datang Monument in Jakarta; and the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay. The countdown clock in Indonesia was later moved to the front of Sarinah Department Store after the unveiling ceremony.\nIssues.\nTraffic in Manila.\nIt was anticipated that heavy traffic in Metro Manila would impact the conduct of games in the Philippines. As part of the preparations, the Philippine local organizing committee has conducted simulations on transporting players from their hotels to the playing venues. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority has also traffic scheme for the duration of the tournament.\nThe Philippine Arena would be stripped off of its role as the final round venue due to \"serious traffic and transport concerns\". In addition the accessibility of the venue in Bulacan adjacent to Metro Manila, has been a longtime issue. Unlike the two other venues in Greater Manila, the Philippine Arena is not accessible by public transport.\nAttendance in Okinawa.\nBlocks of seat were left vacant for the opening game of the Japanese national team against Germany at the 8,500-seater Okinawa Arena. Players from Japan made a complaint which prompted intervention by FIBA. FIBA resold unused corporate tickets for Okinawa games to the general public for subsequent games which boosted attendance, including games not involving Japan.\nNew Zealand game court storming.\nThe New Zealand vs United States game at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay on 26 August 2023 had a court storming incident. Prior to the start of the game, a ticket-paying fan wearing full New Zealand jersey stormed the court. He was stopped after the New Zealand bench informed the organizers that the fan is not part of their squad.\nSerbian player kidney injury.\nSerbian player Boriša Simanić was rendered injured after he was elbowed by Nuni Omot of South Sudan with two minutes left in the game. Simanić underwent a surgery at the Makati Medical Center. However, due to complications, he had to undergo a second operation to remove one of his kidneys. He also had to receive a blood transfusion.\nFilipino senators' shirt statement.\nSenators Joel Villanueva, Migz Zubiri, Bato dela Rosa, and Bong Go attended live the Philippines' final classification match against China with shirts with the \"West PH Sea\" and the Philippine flag as a show of support to the Philippine claim in the South China Sea disputes. Online critics described the stunt as \"perfomative\". Senator Francis Tolentino defended his colleagues insisting that there is nothing wrong to \"express personal political beliefs\" even in a FIBA game."

They broke the record later that day. After have ridden the team pursuit for the first time, the record has been broken nine times. Ellen van Dijk is the only woman who always has been part of the squad when a record was broken. The current record was settled during the 2012 Summer Olympics by Ellen van Dijk, Kirsten Wild and Vera Koedooder in a time of 3:20.013 (53.996 km/h) on 4 August 2012. After the 2011–12 track cycling season the UCI changed the discipline into a 4000 m team pursuit with 4 riders.\nProgression.\n4000 m team pursuit with four riders (from 2012).\nAfter 2012 Ellen van Dijk stopped riding on the track, focussing on the road. Because Van Dijk was the most important rider for the team and because the team needs an addition rider, the national coach and technical director decided not to have a Dutch women's team pursuit team. For that reason there is not yet an official 4000 m team pursuit national record."

        "title": "English cricket team in the West Indies in 2014–15",
        "text": "The England national cricket team toured the West Indies between April and May 2015 for a three-match Test series, preceded by two two-day warm-up matches against a St Kitts Invitational XI.\nEngland announced their squad for the tour on 18 March 2015. Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes were not initially selected due to injuries sustained at the 2015 Cricket World Cup, though Ali joined the squad for the second Test. Uncapped Test players Adil Rashid, Adam Lyth and Mark Wood were included, along with Jonathan Trott, who last played for England in the 2013–14 Ashes series.\nThe series finished as a draw, which meant England retained the Wisden Trophy they won when the West Indies toured England in 2012. The first Test in Antigua finished as a draw before England won the second Test in Grenada by nine wickets. However, the third Test finished in less than three days after the second day produced 18 wickets, a record for a Test in the West Indies; the home side bowled England out for just 123 runs in the second innings, setting up a five-wicket victory as they chased down a target of 192.\nBackground.\nThe tour was part of a very full England schedule for 2015, during which they played international cricket every month of the year. England were coming to the West Indies immediately after the 2015 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand and Australia. Additionally, England had a scheduled ODI against Ireland in Dublin three days after the final Test match. The schedule for the Test series was announced in August 2014, with the three Test matches scheduled to take place at: Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, the National Cricket Stadium in Grenada, and Kensington Oval in Barbados. Sir Vivian Richards Stadium hadn’t hosted a Test match since 2009, when a Test match between England and the West Indies was cancelled after just ten deliveries had been bowled due to an unsafe outfield. Grenada was also hosting its first Test match since 2009, and this marked the first time that England had ever played an international match at the National Cricket Stadium. England went into the tour in bad form on the back of a disastrous campaign in the World Cup.However, their most recent Test series had been a success, as they defeated India 3-1 in a home series in August 2014.\nSquads.\nEngland announced their 16-man squad for the tour on 18 March 2015. One question for England going into the tour was who would open the batting alongside captain Alastair Cook, something that had been a regular issue for the team since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012. The incumbent in the role was Sam Robson, who had played seven Test matches for England in the summer of 2014, but his performances had been mediocre. He played for England Lions in a tour of South Africa in January 2015, where he made only 46 runs in three innings. The main alternatives for England, Adam Lyth and Alex Lees, had also gone on the tour, but neither had done much better than Robson and neither had any Test match experience. Another option was Jonathan Trott, who had not played an international match for England since the 2013-14 Ashes series, when he left Australia early due to a stress-related illness. Trott captained the England Lions on a tour of South Africa in January 2015 and scored an unbeaten 211 in the first unofficial Test match of the series to put himself back into contention to play for England. Although he had originally batted at number 3 for England, this spot was now filled by Gary Ballance, and Trott had said that he was happy to open the batting instead. England decided to leave Robson out of their squad for the tour, and included both Trott and Lyth as options to replace him.\nAll-rounder Chris Woakes was left out of the touring team due to a foot injury, which had caused him to miss England’s last match of the World Cup. He was replaced in the squad by Ben Stokes. Spin bowler Moeen Ali was also left out because of a side strain he had suffered in the World Cup, so England included Adil Rashid and James Tredwell in the squad. Rashid had not yet made his Test debut, but had played ten limited overs internationals for England until 2009, and Tredwell had only played a single Test match five years earlier. Ali resumed training with his county side, Worcestershire, earlier than expected at the start of April, putting him on track to return to the national side by the time of the second Test match.\nTour matches.\nEngland's tour matches were played against a very weak St Kitts Invitational XI, which included several players who had never played a first-class match and a sixteen-year-old. After St Kitts won the toss and elected to bat first in the first match, England dismissed their entire team for just 59 runs before the first session had finished. England then went in to bat with Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott as their opening pair, and the two survived 50 overs and scored 158 runs before England lost a wicket. Trott scored a half-century and Cook a century, then the rest of England's batsmen had an easy time on the second day as well, with Ian Bell and Joe Root both scoring half-centuries before England declared. England almost managed an unlikely victory in the two-day match, but they couldn't take all ten wickets before stumps. England's bowlers were mostly impressive, and James Tredwell looked to be bowling better than Adil Rashid, making him the more likely of the two to play in the first Test match.\nThe second tour match wasn't a proper match of cricket. The match was set up so that the St Kitts Invitational XI would bat for the entire first day regardless of how many wickets they lost, then England would bat for the entire second day regardless of how many wickets they lost. In an effort to give match practice to as many of England's players as possible, a number of players from England's squad played for both England and the St Kitts XI. Reserve wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow scored 98 for St Kitts, while Jonathan Trott failed when batting for both sides and Adam Lyth failed when batting for England, throwing into question which of them would bat alongside Alastair Cook in the first Test match.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nHaving been put in to bat by the West Indians, England started slowly, losing captain Alastair Cook (11), Jonathan Trott (0) and Gary Ballance (10) in the first session, but the arrival of Ian Bell and Joe Root to the crease with England on 34/3 saw the pair put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket. Root fell 17 runs short of a century when he played a delivery from Jerome Taylor onto his own stumps, but Bell managed to kick on to a century of his own, ably supported from the other end by Ben Stokes, adding 130 runs for the fifth wicket before Bell was caught behind off Kemar Roach for 143 at the end of the penultimate over of the day. Nevertheless, England reached the close of play on day 1 at 341/5.\nStokes only lasted just over five overs into the second day before he was caught in the gully by Jason Holder off Taylor for 79. His dismissal sparked a flurry of wickets for England, losing nightwatchman James Tredwell (8), Jos Buttler (0) and Stuart Broad (0) for the addition of just four runs. Only a late flurry from Chris Jordan (21) and James Anderson (20) kept an air of respectability for the England tail, helping them to a total of 399 by the end of the innings, Roach finishing with figures of 4/94. The West Indian response started in a more measured fashion than England's, but wickets continued to fall at regular intervals, and they were 99/4 by the 38th over. However, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Jermaine Blackwood were able to help them recover to 155/4 by the end of the day.\nDay three started with continued resistance from Chanderpaul and Blackwood, before Chanderpaul offered a relatively simple catch to Stokes off the bowling of Tredwell, falling four runs short of a half-century. After that, Holder was the only tail-ender to offer any resistance to the England bowling, as Blackwood seized control of the innings to record a maiden Test century in only his sixth match. Blackwood finished unbeaten on 112 as he ran out of partners to leave the West Indies all out on 295, 104 runs short of England's first innings total. England's second innings again began with early wickets, losing Trott (4) and Cook (13) within seven overs, followed by Bell (11) shortly after, but a solid partnership between Ballance and Root helped England stabilise their innings on 116/3 by the end of the day.\nBoth Ballance and Root passed their half-centuries early on the fourth day before Root (59) was bowled by Holder midway through the first session, the pair having added 114 runs for the fourth wicket. In search of a sufficient lead to allow a declaration, Stokes scored a quickfire 35 before he was stumped off the bowling of Sulieman Benn. Buttler then came out and scored an even quicker 59, while Ballance passed 100 runs at the other end. Fifty partnerships for the fifth, sixth and seventh wickets helped England to a total of 333 before the loss of Jordan prompted the tourists to declare. England made an early breakthrough as the West Indies attempted to reach a target of 438, dismissing Kraigg Brathwaite for just five runs, caught by Root at short leg off Broad. Devon Smith and Darren Bravo revived the West Indies run chase, only for Bravo to fall to a superb slip catch from Jordan off Root with just under six overs left in the day, as the home side closed at 98/2.\nThe final day saw England only manage to take five of the eight wickets required for victory, but two of those fell to Anderson. Playing in his 100th Test match, Anderson first found the edge of Marlon Samuels' bat to equal Ian Botham's England record of 383 Test wickets, before surpassing it with the help of Cook at first slip to dismiss Denesh Ramdin. By that stage, the West Indies were seven down for 294 runs, still 144 away from victory, but with only 19 overs left in the match. England continued to press for the final three wickets, but Holder stood firm on the way to a maiden Test century, and he and Roach batted out the day to end the match as a draw.\n2nd Test.\nThe start of the second Test was delayed by almost two hours due to rain, but when the match finally got started, England put the West Indies in to bat and took the first wicket with the first ball of the third over, James Anderson bowling Kraigg Brathwaite (1) off his pads. They then lost Devon Smith (15) just before the end of the morning session, caught behind off the bowling of Chris Jordan. Darren Bravo (35) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (1) then fell in quick succession midway through the afternoon session, before Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood shared a 55-run stand for the fifth wicket as Samuels reached a half-century. Blackwood was trapped LBW by Jordan shortly before the end of play, an original not out decision overturned on review, leaving Denesh Ramdin to join Samuels, who was six short of a century overnight. Samuels later claimed he was inspired to his long innings by Ben Stokes' sledging.\nThe start of play was again delayed on day 2, but Samuels took little time to complete his century. However, he was out shortly afterwards, caught by Ian Bell at second slip off Anderson, and the West Indies were 223/6. Three quick wickets from Stuart Broad followed, taking Ramdin, Jason Holder and Kemar Roach, before a fifty partnership from Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel for the final wicket took their score to 299 all out. England had 26 overs left in the day to begin their response, and they managed to close out the day with both Alastair Cook – who surpassed Alec Stewart as England's second-highest Test run scorer – and Jonathan Trott still at the crease, reaching 74/0 at stumps.\nTo make up for the lost time on the first two days, play started 15 minutes early on day 3. Both Cook and Trott reached half-centuries early on in the day before Trott was caught at second slip by Blackwood off the bowling of Bishoo for 59. Cook batted on to make 76 before he was bowled by Gabriel, and Bell followed in much the same way two overs later, allowing Gary Ballance and Joe Root to take up the reins. The pair put on 165 runs before Ballance was bowled by Samuels for 77. Moeen Ali (0) then ran himself out attempting a single and Stokes (8) holed out attempting to pull Bishoo over deep midwicket, where he was caught by Blackwood. As Stokes walked off, he was saluted by Samuels in response to Stokes' sledging from earlier in the match. Meanwhile, Root passed the century mark and was joined at the crease by Jos Buttler as the day came to a close with England on 373/6.\nPlay started 15 minutes early again on day 4, but Buttler lasted less than four overs into the day's play, stumped by Ramdin off Bishoo, but Root and Jordan managed a quick 39-run partnership for the eighth wicket before Jordan was deemed to have been just run out by Holder for 16, followed by Broad for a duck after a review found the ball brushed his glove on the way through to slip. Root continued to farm the strike opposite Anderson for the final wicket, only for the innings to be brought to an abrupt end when Anderson was run out, having failed to ground his bat behind the crease when he could have easily saved himself. The wicket denied Root the chance of a double-century, as he finished not out on 182, with England all out for 464. England made an early breakthrough yet again as the West Indies began their second innings, Anderson bowling Devon Smith for 2 runs, but a 142-run partnership between Brathwaite and Bravo restored the West Indies to 145/2 following the dismissal of Bravo by Broad. The home side were on 202/2 at stumps, helped by a century from Brathwaite, leaving them 37 runs ahead of England going into the final day of the match.\nBrathwaite made just 15 more runs on the morning of the final day before he fended a ball from Anderson to Root in the gully. The next seven wickets fell for just 76 runs, the majority coming from Samuels (37) and Ramdin (28). Anderson continued to be among the wickets, dismissing both Samuels and Chanderpaul (7), as well as running out Holder with a direct hit for 2 runs. The other four wickets fell to Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan, as the West Indies were dismissed for 307, setting England a target of 143 to win. Although they lost Trott for a duck in the second over, Cook (59) and Ballance (81) were able to steer England to victory with relative ease, as Ballance became the third-fastest England batsman to reach 1,000 Test runs. The win was England's first away from home since December 2012."

Two-time defending champion Thomas Lange of Germany settled with a bronze medal this time, becoming the fourth man to win three medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nFive of the 22 single scullers from the 1992 Games returned: two-time gold medalist Thomas Lange of Germany, silver medalist Václav Chalupa of Czechoslovakia (now representing the Czech Republic), fifth-place finisher Jüri Jaanson of Estonia, sixth-place finisher Sergio Fernández González of Argentina, and thirteenth-place finisher Massimo Marconcini of Italy. The field was strong with no clear favorite. There were four World Champions competing in Atlanta: Lange (1987 and 1989), Jaanson (1990), Derek Porter of Canada (1993), and Iztok Čop of Slovenia (reigning, 1995). Chalupa was a four-time World silver medalist along with his 1992 Olympic silver. Fernández González was the reigning Pan American champion. Lange, Xeno Müller of Switzerland, and Jaanson had won the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively. \nThe Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Russia, Slovenia, and Ukraine each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 18th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used since 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardized in 1960. The use of multiple classes of semifinals and finals to rank every boat, introduced in 1992, continued as well.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winner in each heat advanced directly to Semifinals A/B. The remaining rowers competed in the repechage for the remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe first two rowers in each race advanced to Semifinals A/B, the rest went to Semifinals C/D.\nSemifinals.\nRowers competing in Semifinals A/B were the rowers who still have chance to win medal in Final A. The first three rowers from each semifinal advanced to Final A, while the others advanced to Final B. On the other hand, rowers competing in Semifinals C/D were the rowers who were already eliminated from the medal race. The first three rowers from these semifinals advanced to Final C and the others to Final D."

        "text": "The Montenegro men's national volleyball team represents Montenegro in international men's volleyball competitions and friendly matches. The national volleyball team was formed in 2006, recently after independence. Montenegro has been a full member of FIVB and CEV since 2006.\nMontenegro played their first official match on 1 September 2007 in Podgorica and won against Latvia (3–1).\nUntil 2017, at major tournaments, Montenegro played in FIVB World League and European League. Montenegro made main success at 2014, winning the gold medal in European League.\nHistory.\nSoon after the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum, the Volleyball Federation of Montenegro founded national teams. The men's team started to play in 2007, with the first match against Latvia (3–1, Olympic Games qualifiers).\nFrom 2007 to 2013, Montenegro played three times in European Championship qualifiers, but without significant success. At the same time, the team played two times in qualifiers for Olympic Games and once in qualifiers for World Championship.\nFirst better result, Montenegrin team made at 2013, on their debut in European League. After 12 games, Montenegro won fifth place among 12 European teams. A year later, Montenegrin volleyball team made their major success until today, with the gold medal in European League 2014. In the finals, Montenegro won both games against Greece (3–1, 3–2).\nAfter the result in European League, during summer 2015, Montenegro debuted in FIVB World League. As a member of Pool C, Montenegro won the group at first stage of World League and qualified for final tournament (Pool B promotion) in Bratislava. At semifinals, Montenegro eliminated China (3–1). In the final game, Montenegro lost against Egypt (2–3), so they didn't qualify for World League Pool B competition. In the end, Montenegro won 22nd position in 2015 FIVB World League.\nA year later, Montenegro played in 2016 FIVB Volleyball World League, again in Pool C, but didn't make similar result as 2015. Montenegro finished World League season as a fourth-placed team in Pool C, but didn't qualify for the final tournament. The reason was that Germany, as a host nation, directly qualified for the finals.\nIn summer 2016, Montenegro played in the main round of 2017 Men's European Volleyball Championship qualification, but failed to qualify for the final tournament. Same result, Montenegrin team made in 2018 World Championship qualifiers, finishing as a third placed team in Group D.\nBiggest success for Montenegrin team came at 2019. After the games against Slovakia, Moldova and Iceland, they qualified for European Championship 2019.\nCompetitive record.\nUntil now, Montenegro never played on World Championship or Olympic Games. They participated in European Volleyball Championship (2), FIVB Volleyball World League (3) and European Volleyball League (2).\nBiggest success of the team was gold medal at 2014 Men's European Volleyball League.\nWorld Championship.\nMontenegro men's national volleyball team participated in the qualifiers for one World Championship (2014), but never played at main competition.\n\"As of May 30, 2018\"\nEuropean Championship.\nMontenegro men's national volleyball team played five times in the qualifiers for European Championship (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017), but never played at main competition.\nOlympic Games.\nMontenegro men's national volleyball team played two times in the qualifiers for Olympic Games (2008, 2012), but never played at main competition.\nEuropean League.\nMontenegro men's national volleyball team played twice in Men's European Volleyball League, with the gold medal from 2014 edition. That was the main success in the history of Montenegrin national volleyball team.\nWorld League.\nMontenegro men's national volleyball team played three times in FIVB Volleyball World League (2015, 2016 and 2017). At their first performance, Montenegro won 22nd place and played on Pool C final tournament. Year later, Montenegro won 29th place in FIVB World League and in 2017 finished in 31st place.\nHead coaches.\nSince 2007, the national team of Montenegro has been led by six different head coaches. Most successful coach were Slobodan Boškan, who won the gold medal on European League with Montenegrin team and Veljko Bašić, who led Montenegro to 2019 European Volleyball Championship and 2021 European Volleyball Championship. \nSources: \nOfficial matches.\nMontenengro played its first official match in September 2007. There is a list of official matches of the Montenegro men's national volleyball team.\nOpponents.\nBelow is the list of performances of Montenegro men's national volleyball team against every opponent.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is the Montenegrin roster in the 2017 World League.\nHead coach: Veljko Basić"

He passed 1,000 metres in 2:39.2. In the early laps, Belgium's Willy Polleunis closely followed Foster, but soon after 1,000 metres the Belgian started to drop from the Briton's pace, and became the first runner to lose contact with the lead group. Polleunis would finish fifteenth and last in this final. Foster kept up the fast and steady pace, passing 2,000 metres in 5:20.2. Finland's Lasse Viren had already moved behind Foster during the second kilometre, with East Germany's Manfred Kuschmann running third. At 2,800 metres, Foster suddenly surged, and only Viren tried to keep up with him. The British runner passed 3,000 metres in 8:01.2.

        "text": "The individual show jumping in equestrian at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics was held from 14–19 August. Like all other equestrian events, the jumping competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division. There were 74 competitors from 27 nations. The event was won by Nick Skelton of Great Britain, the nation's first victory in individual jumping and first medal of any color since making the podium four consecutive Games from 1960 to 1972. Silver went to Peder Fredricson of Sweden. Eric Lamaze of Canada took bronze, becoming the first person since 1968 and sixth overall to win multiple medals (adding to his 2008 gold).\nThe medals were presented by Gerardo Werthein, IOC member, Argentina and Luiz Roberto Giugni, Executive Board Member of the FEI.\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nThree of the top 11 riders (including ties for 9th place) from the 2012 Games returned: gold medalist Steve Guerdat of Switzerland, fifth-place finisher Nick Skelton of Great Britain, and ninth-place finisher Ben Maher of Great Britain. Also returning was 2008 gold medalist Eric Lamaze of Canada, who reached the first round of the final in 2012. Ludger Beerbaum of Germany, the 1992 gold medalist, was back for his seventh Games after missing 2012. The reigning World Champion was Jeroen Dubbeldam of the Netherlands.\nChinese Taipei, Morocco, Peru, and Qatar each made their debut in the event. France and the United States both competed for the 22nd time, tied for most of any nation.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could qualify up to 4 horse and rider pairs; there were a total of 75 quota places. Each of the 15 nations qualified for the team jumping could enter 4 pairs in the individual event. The qualified teams were:\nThere were also 15 individual qualification places, with NOCs not earning team spots able to earn up to 2 individual spots. Most were assigned through regional groups, though some places were open to all competitors:\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the five-round, two-stage format introduced in 1992. The first three rounds made up the qualifications, with cuts between each round. The top 60 advanced to the second round; the top 45 advanced to the third round. The second and third rounds were also used for the team jumping event. Following the qualifications, the top 35 pairs moved on to the final round. Only the top 20 pairs advanced to the second of the two final rounds. Final rankings were based on the sum of scores from both rounds of the final stage. A jump-off would be held to break a tie for any of the medal positions.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nRound 1.\nThe first qualifying round was run on a course with an allowed time of 82 seconds.\nRound 2.\nThe second qualifying round took place on 16 August and had an allowed time of 81 seconds.\nRound 3.\nThe third qualifying round was run on 17 August on an allowed time of 82 seconds.\nA maximum of three riders from a single country could advance to the individual final. Therefore, Ludger Beerbaum did not advance as Germany had three riders with fewer penalty points. The four riders from Switzerland had 9 penalty points each. The Swiss team leader decided not to send Janika Sprunger to the final."

        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured Australia from 24 November 2014 to 10 January 2015. The tour consisted of two tour matches and four Test matches. The first Test was originally scheduled on 4 December in Brisbane, but it was postponed because of the death of Phillip Hughes. Instead, Adelaide hosted the first Test from 9 December and the Brisbane hosted the second Test from 17 December. Following the draw in the third Test, Indian captain MS Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket with immediate effect. After the draw in the final Test in Sydney, Australia won the series 2–0. Following the Test matches, Australia and India participated in the Carlton Mid Triangular Series with the England cricket team.\nBackground.\nIndia had recently lost a Test series against England in England 3–1, while Australia lost a Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates 2–0.\nSquads.\nIndian selectors selected a 19-man squad for the Test series. Naman Ojha was included as the backup for Wriddhiman Saha in the first Test. MS Dhoni was not part of the team in the first Adelaide Test due to an injury. Therefore, Virat Kohli captained India in the first Test. Dhawal Kulkarni was asked to join India's Test squad as cover for the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was suffering from an ankle injury. Indian captain MS Dhoni announced his retirement after the conclusion of the Melbourne Test, with Kohli leading the team in the fourth Test as well.\nOn the other hand, the Australian selectors selected 13 members for the first Test. Australian Test captain Michael Clarke had to pass a fitness test before appearing in the first Test match at Adelaide. Shaun Marsh was added to the Australian squad as cover for Michael Clarke. But Clarke had taken no further part in the series after injuring his right hamstring. Thereby, Steve Smith was selected as standby captain for the 2nd to 4th Tests ahead of vice captain Brad Haddin. Queenslander Joe Burns replaced an injured Mitchell Marsh for the Boxing Day Test. Ashton Agar was added to the squad for the last Test.\nTest series.\nTrophy background.\nEntering the series, India held the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after winning the 2012–13 series 4–0. Australia won the previous series at home, (2011–12) also 4–0.\nDecision Review System (DRS).\nThe series was played without the players having access to the decision review system (DRS) also known as UDRS. The DRS could be used in any Test series at the agreement of both participating cricket boards, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India opposed its use in this series. Umpires could still initiate reviews to the third umpire for run out, stumping and no ball decisions. Before the first Test, India captain Virat Kohli stated that the system had to be \"100% perfect\".\n1st Test.\nAustralia won the toss and chose to bat on a wicket which some commentators suggesting the flattest ever at the Adelaide Oval. David Warner made a blistering start with the score at 0/40 after 4 overs. But Chris Rogers (9) fell shortly after from an edge to Shikhar Dhawan bowled by Ishant Sharma. Shane Watson (14) also fell to Dhawan via an edge. Michael Clarke steadied the innings while Warner scored his 10th century off 106 balls. Clarke (60) eventually retired hurt after a back injury. Karn Sharma took his first Test wicket after David Warner (145) holed out. Australia lost late wickets in the last session, losing 4 wickets to end the day at 6/354 after at one stage being 3/345. Brad Haddin (0) was dismissed on the last ball of the day.\nMichael Clarke returned to the crease at the start of Day 2 with a back brace, and put on a 51-run partnership with Steve Smith, before a rain delay left Smith stranded just 2 runs short of a century. The rain consistently fell and lunch was taken early. The players returned after lunch and Smith brought up his century in the first ball. Play was delayed once again just 2 overs later. Play resumed again and Clarke reached his own century as the pair quickly added another 50 before yet another rain delay. Play continued and more quick runs were added as Smith reached 150. Clarke then was dismissed by Karn Sharma for 128 and stumps were called just one over later because of bad light. Shami, Aaron and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.\nAustralia captain Michael Clarke declared overnight and sent India in to bat at the start of Day 3. Shikhar Dhawan made a brisk start but was bowled by Ryan Harris for 25. Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara put on an 81-run partnership before Mitchell Johnson dismissed Vijay caught behind (53). India reached lunch at a solid 2/119. Pujara and Kohli continued their partnership after lunch and put on another 81-run stand until Pujara was bowled by Nathan Lyon for 73. Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane saw out a late onslaught from Lyon to be 3/223 at tea. Rahane pushed on after tea, but was caught off his gloves for 62. Rohit Sharma came in and helped push them towards 400 as Kohli brought up his 2nd century at Adelaide Oval. Kohli (115) was eventually dismissed with 4 overs remaining in the day. Wriddhiman Saha and Sharma successfully saw India to 5/369 at stumps.\nAustralia took the remaining 5 wickets in the first session with Nathan Lyon the pick of the bowlers taking 5/134. The Australian openers got to lunch unscathed, scoring 32 runs off 10 overs. Karn Sharma took the wicket of Chris Rogers (21) after he mis-timed a sweep to Rohit Sharma. David Warner and Shane Watson combined to take Australia to a solid 1/137 at tea, but Warner should have been out after being bowled off a no-ball by Varun Aaron. Warner (102) made his second century of the innings after the break. Australia finished the day at 5/290, after Mitchell Marsh (40) and Steve Smith (52*) scored at a fast rate including a 24-run over from Marsh off Karn Sharma. Commentators criticised India for their negative tactics. Also, controversy ensued twice in the final session when Warner was given a send-off from Aaron causing a dispute between them. Rohit Sharma's appeal also caused a stand-off between the players leaving the umpires, Ian Gould and Marais Erasmus to calm them down. As a result, Warner was fined 15% of his match fee while Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan were fined 30%.\nAustralia again declared overnight, leaving them 98 overs to bowl out India. Shikhar Dhawan was first to go (9), but shouldn't have been, after replays showed the ball came off his arm. Cheteshwar Pujara (21) was next out when he was caught behind off Nathan Lyon. Murali Vijay and stand-in captain Virat Kohli put on a further 45 as India reached a solid 2/105 at lunch. After lunch the pair extended their partnership to 185, as Kohli brought up his second century of the match, before a devastated Vijay was given lbw for 99.

Australian captain, Michael Clarke injured his right hamstring during the run-chase and admitted that he may never play again, Brad Haddin replaced him as captain during the innings.\n2nd Test.\nMS Dhoni won the toss for India and elected to bat on the first morning on a fast pitch, good for batting.

Vijay (45*) and Cheteshwar Pujara (15*) led India to lunch at 1/89. India started very slowly after lunch, as Mitch Marsh limped off the field with a hamstring injury. Pujara (18) was eventually caught behind for Josh Hazlewood's first test wicket. However, replays showed the ball came off his helmet. Virat Kohli came in on the back of 2 centuries in the first test, and was caught behind for just 19. Ajinkya Rahane was shaky at the crease but steadied to reach tea on 13. India were 3/151 at tea with Vijay also not out on 73. Rahane and Vijay started quickly after tea as Vijay reached his century.

Johnson (88) and Smith (133) were dismissed shortly after the interval. Australia's tail annoyed the tired Indians as Mitchell Starc (51*) scored his fourth test fifty before the tea break. Starc (52) was bowled just after tea, giving Australia a solid 97-run first innings lead. All four main bowlers conceded 100 runs, with Umesh Yadav (3/101) being the pick of them. Mitchell Starc bowled Murali Vijay (27) after a quick start, India finished on 1/71 at the end of day 3.\nIndia lost 5 early wickets on Day 4 as Mitchell Johnson ripped through their middle order of Kohli, Rahane, Rohit, and Dhoni. Cheteshwar Pujara (43) was caught just before lunch as India reached lunch reeling at 7/157.

The Cardinals, led by first year head coach Tic Price, played their home games at the Montagne Center and were members of the Southland Conference.\nAfter former head coach, Pat Knight, was fired on February 16, 2014, the Cardinals finished the season with a record of 1–4 under interim head coach, Tic Price. Price was named head coach on March 18, 2014. The 2014–2015 was coach Price's first season as the Cardinals' head coach.\nThe Cardinals were picked to finish tenth (10th) in the conference in both the Coaches' Poll and the Sports Information Director polls.\nThe Cardinals finished the season 15–15, 9–9 in Southland play to finish in sixth place. Due to APR penalties, they were not eligible for postseason play, including the Southland tournament. Compared to total wins (all Division I) for the previous two seasons of three and four respectively, the fifteen wins (eleven wins over NCAA Division I competition) represented a marked improvement.\nTwo Cardinals were recognized by the Southland Conference at the conclusion of the regular season. Tyran de Lattibeaudiere received several Southland Conference honors. He was named Southland Conference Newcomer of the Year. In addition, he was named to both the conference All-Defense team and the All-Southland Conference, 2nd team. Anthony Holiday was named to the All-Southland Conference, 3rd team.\nMedia.\nAll Lamar Cardinals home games except those otherwise contracted for will be broadcast online live by Big Red Sports Network (BRSN).\nOff season.\nOn April 16, Tic Price named his coaching staff. Anthony Anderson, Robert Kummer, and Antonio Madlock were named assistant coaches. On May 16, Coach Madlock resigned to take a similar position at Mississippi. Price completed his staff on June 27 naming Matt Pace as Director of Basketball Operations. Brian Burton was named assistant coach filling the vacancy left by Antonio Madlock's departure in May.\nIn May, Lamar was informed that the men's basketball team would not be eligible for postseason play for failure to achieve NCAA APR standards. The team also has reduced practice from six days per week down to five per week and will be allowed only 16 hours of practice time a week instead of the normal 20 hours per week.

However, on December 22, 2014 the Pan American Sailing Federation announced the total quota was raised to 148 athletes and 93 boats (with the laser and laser standard events each receiving an additional four boats).

        "text": "Orlando Emilio Sánchez Caminero (born May 26, 1988) is a Dominican professional basketball player for Bucaneros de La Guaira of the Venezuelan Liga Profesional de Baloncesto (LPB). He played college basketball for Monroe College and St. John's University, and has represented the Dominican Republic in international competition.\nEarly life.\nAs a young child, Sánchez moved in with his grandparents after his parents were unable to take care of him due to financial difficulties. Although they weren't well off by any means (his grandmother had various health problems that prevented her from working), they were more comfortable and able to care of him. After his grandfather died in 1998, Sánchez and his grandmother, Sabrina Vargas, got by on the money he left them until that eventually ran out. It was around this time that his father suggested he come work for him as an apprentice carpenter in Spain. So at age 17, Sánchez dropped out of high school, went to work in Spain and sent what money he could back to his grandmother.\nSánchez spent three years working in Spain, including one in another town without his father after the two had a falling-out. It was during this time that Sánchez first started playing basketball. In 2008–09, he played 28 games for Ferrallas Los Llanos Hellín of the Liga EBA, before moving back to the Dominican Republic in 2009 where he played eight games for San Lazaro of the Dominican District National league, and subsequently won the District National Rookie of the Year award. That same year, at age 21, he finally graduated from high school, and in 2010, he made his Dominican national team debut.\nCollege career.\nSánchez then enrolled at Monroe College where as a freshman in 2010–11, he earned honorable mention JUCO All-American honors after averaging 8.5 points, 11.5 rebounds (ranked seventh in the nation) and 4.3 blocks per game (ranked third among all junior college players). His efforts led the Mustangs to a 31-5 record, the NJCAA Region 15 title, the District III championship and a best-ever third-place finish in the 2011 NJCAA National Championship in Hutchinson, Kansas. Following the season, he played on the Dominican national team that was coached by Kentucky's John Calipari.\nAs a sophomore in 2011–12, Sánchez led Monroe to a fifth-place national finish and earned All-NJCAA all-tournament honors and garnered second team NJCAA Region 15 all-star accolades after averaging 10.2 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.9 blocks per game. In April 2012, he graduated from Monroe with an associate degree in business administration. Later that month, he signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for St. John's University.\nIn November 2012, Sánchez was deemed ineligible to play by the NCAA after the organization determined that, at age 24, he had used up his four years of eligibility. On February 28, 2013, he was granted a waiver based on hardship, allowing him to play for St. John's in 2013–14. After sitting out the entire 2012–13 season, Sánchez made his debut for St. John's on November 8, 2013, scoring five points in a 75-86 loss to Wisconsin. In 32 games (18 starts) for the Red Storm in 2013–14, Sánchez averaged 7.4 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocks in 22.3 minutes per game. Following the season, he graduated from St. John's with a bachelor's degree in sport management.\nProfessional career.\n2014–15 season.\nSánchez went undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft. On September 17, 2014, he signed with the New York Knicks. However, he was later waived by the Knicks on October 24, 2014 after appearing in one preseason game. On November 3, 2014, he was acquired by the Westchester Knicks of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player. Sánchez played 33 games for Westchester before leaving the team in late February. He returned to the Dominican Republic and signed with Metros de Santiago in March for the 2015 LNB season. In 29 games for Metros, he averaged 10.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.4 steals per game.\n2015–16 season.\nOn December 9, 2015, Sánchez signed with Bucaneros de La Guaira for the 2016 LPB season.\nNational team career.\nSánchez was a member of the Dominican national team that competed in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. In six games, he averaged 2.2 points and 2.5 rebounds per game.\nPersonal.\nSánchez is the son of Enhmin Patricia Caminero Martínez and Orlando E. Sánchez Vargas, and has three sisters, Jonaira, Yamile and Natasha; and one brother, Yauger. He and his wife, Flor Esthefani, gave birth to daughter Ysabel Angel on February 21, 2014."

Match referee for the finals was former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd.\nAftermath.\nInternational Cricket Council's (ICC) rule for One Day International (ODI) cricket at that time was: \"a minimum of 25 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second to constitute a match\". Indian cricketers criticized the rule ICC Champions Trophy after rain washed-out the final twice. Former Indian wicket-keeper Farokh Engineer about the rule that the \"it's absolutely daft\", and it \"doesn't make any sense\". Sanjay Manjrekar, former Test cricketer, said that the ICC \"should look at that rule straight away and change it\", and the \"obvious thing is to continue from where they left off\". Ajit Wadekar, former Indian captain, called the matches \"boring\" and asked the ICC to revise the group format for the tournament to preclude meaningless matches in the first round."

        "title": "1975 World Team Tennis season",
        "text": "The 1975 World Team Tennis season was the second season of the top professional team tennis league in the United States. The Pittsburgh Triangles defeated the San Francisco Golden Gaters in the WTT Finals to win the league championship.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1975 World Team Tennis season included 10 teams split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). The league intended for each team to play a regular-season schedule of 44 matches. However, WTT scheduled neutral-site matches to cut down on travel and create events where fans could see multiple teams either with one admission or over the course of a few days. These special events were called WTT Spectaculars. Because of these and because of scheduling challenges created when the Houston E-Z Riders suspended operations just days before the season started, the 10 teams in the league did not play an equal number of matches. Seven of them played 44 matches, while three played 46 matches.\nThe top three teams in each division qualified for the playoffs. The second and third-place teams met in division semifinal matches hosted by the second-place teams. The winners of those matches met the first-place team in the best-of-three division championship series. The division semifinal winners hosted the first match of the division championship series. The first-place team hosted the second and third (if necessary) matches. The division champions met in the best-of-three World Team Tennis Final with the lower seed hosting the first match and the higher seed hosting the second and third (if necessary) matches.\nEach match comprised one set each of men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. The order of play was women's doubles first, men's doubles third and mixed doubles fifth. The coach of the home team decided whether men's or women's singles would be played second or fourth. Games were decided by the first player or doubles team to reach four points with no-ad scoring. Each set ended when one team had won either six or seven games and had an advantage over its opponent of at least two games. Sets that were tied 6–6 were decided by a tiebreaker. Set tiebreaker games were nine total points with the first player or doubles team to reach five the winner. An advantage of only one point was needed to win a tiebreaker game. Matches could end when one team built an insurmountable lead. For example, if a team had a 24–17 lead after four sets, the fifth set (mixed doubles) would not be played. If a team had a 22–19 lead after four sets, the match could end if the leading team won four games in the fifth set, since it would be impossible for the trailing team to make up the three-game deficit that existed when the set started. If the match was tied at the end of five sets, a super tiebreaker game was played between the mixed doubles teams using the same format as the set tiebreaker games. Teams sometimes agreed to play dead sets even if the outcome of the match had already been decided or to play sets to completion when the outcome of the match was decided within that set.\nFranchise movement, expansion and contraction.\nOn October 16, 1974, Toronto-Buffalo Royals president John F. Bassett announced that the team had been sold to Herbert S. Hoffman and Phyllis Morse who said that they would move it to Hartford, Connecticut.\nOn October 25, 1974, the Chicago Aces ownership announced that the team was up for sale, and there were ongoing negotiations with several groups of investors including one in Atlanta. The team acknowledged some player salaries were late in being paid and said that the statuses of player contracts would be settled after the team was sold.\nOn November 18, 1974, Seymour Brode and Marshall Greenspan sold the Detroit Loves to a new ownership group led by William H. Bereman and Dan Domont who moved the team to Indianapolis and changed its name to the Indiana Loves.\nBurt McGlynn tried to sell the Minnesota Buckskins to local investors after the 1974 season ended. On November 6, 1974, McGlynn announced that the local interest in the Buckskins had dried up, and the team would either fold or be sold and moved. He mentioned that there was interest from investor groups in Indianapolis and Washington, D.C. The investor group from Indianapolis ended up buying the Loves, and the group from Washington decided not to buy the team. On November 26, 1974, WTT announced at its annual meeting that the Buckskins had become the first team in the league to fold.\nIn late 1974, it was reported that owner Ray Ciccolo had lost about $300,000 operating the Boston Lobsters. In early 1975, he was forced to declare bankruptcy.\nAt the WTT owners meeting on February 1, 1975, each team was required to post a $500,000 letter of credit. Teams that failed to do so—the Baltimore Banners, the Boston Lobsters, the Chicago Aces, the Florida Flamingos and the Hartford Royals—were contracted. A dispersal draft was conducted to distribute the players from those five teams among the remaining teams in the league.\nOn February 6, 1975, Bud Fischer, Frank Goldberg and Ben Press sold the defending WTT champion Denver Racquets to a new ownership group that included Reggie Jackson and his agent Gary K. Walker who moved the team to Phoenix, Arizona and changed its name to the Phoenix Racquets.\nA group of investors that included Bob Mades, Paul Slater, Herbert S. Hoffman, Robert K. Kraft and Harold Bayne emerged as a potential owner for the franchise in Boston. However, the Lobsters had already been contracted by WTT. The group purchased the Philadelphia Freedoms on March 27, and moved the team to Boston. In order to claim the name of the original Lobsters, the new ownership group would be required to settle some of the debts of the former team. The new owners decided to do this and renamed the Freedoms the Boston Lobsters.\nShortly before the start of the 1975 season, WTT granted an expansion franchise to Frank Mariani to play in San Diego. Mariani named the team the San Diego Friars.\nWhile several of the original 16 WTT franchises from 1974, had financial difficulties resulting in six of them not returning for and four of them moving before the 1975 season, the Houston E-Z Riders had made plans to go forward in Houston. The team was to play its 1975 home matches in the brand new Astroarena. However, just before the season started, on May 2, 1975, team president and vice-president E.Z. and Betty Jones announced that the E-Z Riders were suspending operations for the 1975 season. Players under contract with the team could be loaned to other WTT teams, and the E-Z Riders had the right to protect four players to return for the 1976 season. There were rumors that the E-Z Riders were behind on their financial obligations. However, E.Z. Jones said, \"We are 100% current with our league obligations and our player salaries and have even made salary advances.\" In order to return to WTT in 1976, the E-Z Riders would need to meet certain league financial requirements and exercise an option by September 15, 1975. The suspension of operations was so sudden and unexpected that newspaper advertisements for E-Z Riders home matches continued to run after the announcement. The E-Z Riders did not exercise their option to return to the league in 1976, and the team folded on September 15, 1975.\nPlayer draft.\nSeveral high-profile public figures were selected in the 1974 WTT draft. These included comedians Johnny Carson and Bill Cosby, Stan Malless, president of the United States Lawn Tennis Association which objected to WTT, 11-year-old Tracy Austin, Dean Paul Martin, Jr., two-sport star John Lucas and Elton John. Perhaps the most noteworthy selection occurred when Freedoms player-coach Billie Jean King used the team's seventh round pick to select Bobby Riggs whom she had beaten 14 months earlier in the Battle of the Sexes. Stan Smith and Ilie Năstase were chosen by the New York Sets. Ken Rosewall, Manuel Santana, Pancho Gonzales, Andrés Gimeno, Pierre Barthès and Alex Metreveli () were selected by the Hartford Royals. Roy Emerson and Vijay Amritraj () were chosen by the Los Angeles Strings. Olga Morozova () was selected by the Houston E-Z Riders. Clark Graebner and Ove Bengtson were chosen by the Cleveland Nets. Joaquín Loyo-Mayo was selected by the San Francisco Golden Gaters. Jeff Borowiak was chosen by the Hawaii Leis. Julie Heldman was selected by the Chicago Aces. Jan Kodeš was chosen by the Baltimore Banners. Chris Evert was selected by the Florida Flamingos. The top overall selection was Colin Dibley who was chosen by the original Boston Lobsters. The San Diego Friars did not make any selections, because the team had not yet been founded.\nStandings and attendance.\n\"Reference:\" \nTotal attendance during the season was 503,858, for an average of 3,053 over 165 playing dates.\nPlayoff bracket.\n\"Reference:\" \nPlayoff match results.\n\"Reference:\" \nWTT Finals.\nOf the total of 9 playoff matches, home teams won 6 and lost 3.

        "text": "Charles A. Casey (born February 1, 1944) is a former American football player. He played at the end position at the University of Florida. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1965 and set Florida single-season records for receptions (58), receiving yards (809), and receiving touchdowns (8). At the end of his collegiate career, he was the leading receiver in Southeastern Conference (SEC) history with career totals of 114 receptions and 1,612 receiving yards.\nEarly years.\nCasey grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended Brown High School where he was a star athlete in baseball, basketball and football. He was offered a $10,000 signing bonus to play baseball by the Milwaukee Braves and scholarships to play basketball by Navy, Louisville and other schools. Pepper Rodgers, who also attended Atlanta's Brown High, recruited Casey to play football at the University of Florida where Rodgers was an assistant coach.\nUniversity of Florida.\nCasey enrolled at the University of Florida and played at the end position for head coach Ray Graves' Florida Gators football teams from 1963 to 1965. After catching nine passes as a sophomore in 1963, Casey gained notice during a March 1964 scrimmage when he caught six passes. During the 1964 season, and despite being routinely double-teamed, Casey was the SEC's leading receiver, and he broke Florida's single-season records with 47 receptions and 673 receiving yards.\nAs a senior in 1965, Casey broke his own single-season receiving records. In his second season teaming up with Florida quarterback Steve Spurrier, Casey was again the leading receiver in the SEC with 58 receptions for 809 yards and eight touchdowns. He ended his college career as the leading receiver in SEC history. After the 1965 season, he was selected as a first-team All-American offensive end by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) and the Associated Press (AP). He also was selected to play in the Senior Bowl, and received the Daytona Beach Quarterback Club's award as the outstanding senior college football player in the State of Florida. Casey received 13 of 17 first-place votes for the award. The Gators coaching staff named him as the recipient of the team's Fergie Ferguson Award, as the \"senior football player who displays outstanding leadership, character and courage.\"\nLater years.\nCasey was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the sixth round (81st overall pick) of the 1966 NFL Draft. He signed a two-year contract for approximately $125,000, but he was released by the Falcons in August 1966 without appearing in any regular season NFL games.\nCasey was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\"."

He then spent the remainder of his career overseas, including stops in France and Italy.\nJordan played college basketball for the Canisius Golden Griffins. He did not play his senior year at Canisius University because the NCAA declared both he and Larry Fogle ineligible for having received \"improper financial aid\" sometime during his career at the school. Jordan played one year with the Indiana Pacers in the ABA in 1975–76. He also briefly coached at a university in Spain.\nJordan's younger brother, C.J., played college basketball as a point guard for the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns.\nJordan died on November 10, 2023, at the age of 69."

The ex-Notre Dame quarterback returned to his hometown as a coach in 1947, taking over for both the football and ice hockey teams at St. Lawrence. While he stepped away from the hockey program after 1950 in favor of Olav Kollevoll he continued on with the football squad until 1955 when he left to accept the responsibility of leading the Cornell hockey team after its nearly decade-long abandonment.\nThe Big Red officially restarted in 1957 after the opening of the Lynah Rink, the school's first indoor facility, and as might be expected the team struggled through the first few years, going 16–54–2 in his first four years before Patten led them to a winning season in 1961–62, Cornell's first as a member of ECAC Hockey. Patten spent one more season behind the bench before resigning and turning over the program to Ned Harkness."

It was Anthony Foley's first season as head coach.\nEvents.\nOn 27 August a document detailing players individual strengths and weaknesses was leaked. \nThe email intended only for the management team was accidentally sent to every player in the Munster squad. Players were notified within an hour that the email had been sent to them through human error. Anthony Foley speaking on 3 September said that it is unfortunate that the document was leaked saying \"It will never, ever happen again. \nIt's unfortunate that it's out in the public domain, something that we do behind closed doors to make us better.\"\nUpgrades to Thomond Park were completed in time for the new season kick off on 5 September against Edinburgh. The creation of a Fan Zone Plaza and introduction of a dedicated Bank of Ireland Family Fun Zone, and face-lift of the Guinness Dug Out bar were among the improvements and changes carried out at the ground.

        "title": "1972 Olympic men's basketball final",
        "text": "The 1972 Olympic men's basketball final was the last game of that year’s Olympic basketball tournament, and became one of the most controversial events in Olympic history. With the ending mired in controversy, the Soviet Union defeated Team USA by one point, marking the latter's first ever loss in the event. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union won their first eight games of the tournament, with the US team having its overall Olympic record at 63–0 when they advanced to the final against the USSR. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times. The United States team had won the previous seven gold medals at the Olympics, and was among the contenders to win another in Munich at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nBackground.\nThe United States and Soviet Union sporting rivalry reached its peak during the Cold War. The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the Americans had not lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63–0 before the final game. Since the 1952 tournament the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964 and bronze in 1968. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in FIBA World Championship play (at the 1959 world tournament and the 1963 world tournament). However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament.\nThe Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all their top players as soldiers or workers, which allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals. On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the NBA. That disadvantage had not prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the basketball court was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed the 1972 Games were openly anti-American. There were rumors that the Communist party had bribed the officials because they wanted the USSR to win 50 gold medals at these Olympics in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union.\nPreparation.\nThe United States team was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team did not have a clear leader. UCLA's Bill Walton, then a rising star, declined an invitation to participate. Some saw it as a political statement given Walton’s opposition to the Vietnam War, but the most likely reason for his decision was his bad experience at the 1970 FIBA world championship. In a 2004 interview with \"ESPN\", Walton stated that \"for the first time in my life, I was exposed to negative coaching and the berating of players and the foul language and the threatening of people who didn't perform.\" According to Russian sports historian , \"when (the Soviets) saw who was and wasn't on the U.S. team, that's when they started feeling like they'd actually have a chance. They followed American basketball closely and they knew that no Walton was going to be a big deal.\" Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored, featuring such players as Doug Collins and Tommy Burleson (the tallest player among all teams).\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars Sergei Belov, Modestas Paulauskas, and Alexander Belov. The players had played together for more than seven years. For Gennadi Volnov it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\nRoad to the final.\nThe basketball gold medal was the last in contention. The Soviets were clearly ahead in the medal standings, but for political reasons they needed to win 50 golds (having 49 before the final match).\nBoth teams reached the final without any trouble. For the U.S. team the hardest game was against Brazil which it won 61–54. The Soviets faced some problems against Puerto Rico (100–87) and Cuba in the semifinal (67–61), but came out on top in each.\nDuring the game.\nThe Soviets surprised the Americans early, led by Sergei Belov. The Soviets kept the Americans 4–8 points behind during the first half. At half-time the score was 26–21.\nIn the second half the Soviets provoked Dwight Jones, the leading scorer of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute during a loose ball scuffle he was assailed by Mikheil Korkia and responded. Both players were ejected. After this, Ivan Dvorny was also disqualified for protesting from the bench. The Soviets benefited from the double ejection, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones was to the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov violently injured Jim Brewer during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing.\nWith ten minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to ten points. The Americans began to press, and led by Kevin Joyce were able to cut down Soviets' lead to one with thirty eight seconds left. With seven seconds to play, Doug Collins stole Alexander Belov's cross-court pass at half court and was fouled hard by Zurab Sakandelidze as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Lead referee Renato Righetto turned away from the free throw attempt upon hearing the horn, but failed to stop play. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50–49.\nControversy.\nFirst inbounds play.\nImmediately following Collins' second free throw, with the ball then being a \"live\" ball under the rules at the time, Soviet assistant coach Sergei Bashkin charged out of the team's designated bench area to the scorer's table. He asserted that head coach Vladimir Kondrashin had called for a time-out, which should have been awarded prior to the second free throw, but that it had not been granted to them. Since a time-out could not legally be called \"after\" the second free throw, however, the Soviet players had to immediately inbound the live ball without a pre-planned play for the final three seconds. Alzhan Zharmukhamedov inbounded the ball to Sergei Belov, who began to dribble up the sideline, but the disturbance at the scorer's table led Righetto to stop play just as Belov approached mid-court. The game clock was stopped with one second remaining.\nWhen play was stopped, the Soviets pressed their argument about the time-out, with Kondrashin and Bashkin claiming that it had been called as soon as Collins was fouled. By the rules at that time, a time-out could be requested either by informing the scorer's table directly, or by pressing the button of an electronic signaling device, which in turn would illuminate a light bulb at the scorer's table to alert the officials there of the coach's desire for a time-out. According to Kondrashin, he requested his time-out by pressing the button. Also by the rules at the time, upon calling a time-out prior to free throws, the coach was allowed to choose to have it awarded either before the first free throw or between the two free throws; he said he had chosen to take it between the two free throws. The game's referees, however, were not informed of a Soviet time-out request prior to giving the ball to Collins for the second free throw.\nWith regard to the resulting questions of whether he had ever actually made a proper time-out signal, Kondrashin claimed to have later seen a film of the events that he said showed the light bulb illuminating, as well as an official at the scorer's table nodding toward him in apparent recognition of the request. Regarding what happened next and his choice of when to take the requested time-out, Kondrashin said that the officials at the scorer's table \"wanted to give me the time-out before the first free throw; of course I refused.\" However, Hans Tenschert, the game's official scorekeeper, later blamed the Soviet coaches, claiming that they mishandled their signaling device and were therefore late in pressing it.\nThe unexplained horn that sounded as Collins was shooting the second free throw may have happened because the scorer's table had recognized the Soviet time-out request at the last moment and was attempting to stop the second free throw to award it. Renato William Jones, the secretary general of FIBA at the time, later asserted that the problem had indeed been a human error at the scorer's table which resulted in the time-out request being relayed too late to the on-court officials. Despite Kondrashin's and Jones' assurances, the Americans have expressed doubt that the time-out was really called. They have also argued that regardless of whether a time-out may have been missed, the ball became live upon Collins' second free throw, and as such, a technical foul should have been assessed against the Soviets because their coach left the designated bench area during live play.\nAccording to Righetto, after considering the Soviet arguments, the official decision was to \"deny\" the time-out. The protest later filed by the United States also mentioned that the game's official score sheet included no indication of a time-out being granted in the last three seconds. Collins has also confirmed that officially, the time-out was not awarded, which meant that Collins' second free throw counted and that neither team was to be allowed to substitute players when play resumed. Further indicators that no time-out was officially granted to the Soviets can be found in the existing television footage of the game, which includes shots of the scoreboard, both before the incident and at the game's conclusion, with the scoreboard indicating each time that Soviets had one time-out remaining. During the period between the game's interruption and resumption, the footage also does not include the sound of the scorer's table horn that typically would be used to signal both the start and the end of an officially charged time-out. However, even without being granted an official time-out, the minute-long delay to restore order on the court and determine how to proceed still gave the Soviet coaches time to confer with their players and devise a planned inbounds play.\nFurthermore, although Bashkin's actions had caused the game to be stopped with one second remaining on the clock, the officials decided neither to resume play from that point, nor to assess a technical foul against him for having interrupted the play. They instead wiped out the play altogether, ruling that the entire inbounds sequence would be replayed from the point immediately following the second free throw and that the game clock would thus be reset to three seconds. Jones, who had had a contentious relationship with American basketball officials for a number of years, came down from the stands to the court to contribute to the officials' ruling, and he insisted upon a complete replay of the final three seconds. According to Tenschert, Righetto had initially declared that play would resume with just one second remaining, only to be overruled by Jones. Jones later acknowledged that under the Olympic regulations, he had no authority to make rulings about a game in progress, though he maintained that resetting the clock was the correct course of action. Ed Steitz who, over the course of his basketball career, served both as the president of USA Basketball and as a member of FIBA's Technical Committee, claimed that years after the game, Jones privately confided that with the clock reset still leaving only three seconds to play, he had not expected the Soviets would actually be able to score within that time.\nSecond inbounds play.\nThe players were brought back into position for a second inbounds play. However, instead of Zharmukhamedov returning to throw the inbounds pass, Kondrashin managed to substitute Ivan Edeshko into the game in Zharmukhamedov's place. Kondrashin's plan was to have Edeshko attempt a length-of-the-court pass to center Alexander Belov near the American basket, confident that Belov could catch any pass thrown accurately to him there and feeling that Edeshko was the player most skilled in executing such a pass. The two players had successfully run much the same play for CSKA Moscow team the preceding year to claim the Soviet Championship. Under the Olympic rules, substitutions were not to have been allowed without the granting of the time-out, but the referees resumed the game, failing to notice this issue and also not noticing that clock operator Andre Chopard was still working on getting the game clock set to three seconds. The ball was given to Edeshko to start play, with the scoreboard clock actually showing 50 seconds remaining.\nEdeshko was defended at the end line by American center Tom McMillen. With his frame, McMillen aggressively challenged Edeshko's inbounds attempt, making it difficult for Edeshko to pass the ball into play. Edeshko ultimately made only a short pass to teammate Modestas Paulauskas standing in the Soviet backcourt. Paulauskas then immediately relayed a pass toward Belov at the other end of the court. But the horn sounded, with the pass barely out of Paulauskas's hand. The pass then missed its mark and was uneventfully tipped off the backboard. The players, the announcers of both television broadcasts, and the majority of the spectators in the arena all interpreted the sound of the horn, combined with the sight of a failed Soviet pass, as the end of the game. People flooded the court and the U.S. team began a joyful celebration of its apparent one-point victory.\nWith Jones still involved in the process, the officials once again ordered the court to be cleared, the players to be brought back into position, the clock to be reset, and the final three seconds be replayed. The public speaker announced, \"Please go out. There are another three seconds left.\" Furious over the decision to deny the U.S. victory and allow the Soviets yet a third inbounds play, the U.S. coaches briefly considered unilaterally declaring the game to be over by pulling their team off the floor. However, head coach \"Hank\" Iba was concerned that such an action would leave the U.S. vulnerable to a Soviet appeal, which might lead to a ruling that the U.S. had forfeited the game. U.S. assistant coach John Bach reported that Jones threatened him directly with such a forfeiture should the U.S. team not return to the floor. In finally deciding to comply with the officials, Iba reportedly told his coaching staff, \"I don't want to lose this game later tonight, sitting on my butt.\"\nThird inbounds play.\nOn the third inbound try, McMillen was again assigned to use his height to challenge Edeshko's inbound pass. However, as official Artenik Arabadjian prepared to put the ball into play, he gestured to McMillen. McMillen responded by backing several feet away from Edeshko, which gave Edeshko a clear view and unobstructed path to throw a long pass down the court. McMillen later said that Arabadjian had instructed him to back away from Edeshko. McMillen said that despite the fact that there was no rule which would require him to do so, he decided to comply, fearing that if he did not, Arabadjian might assess a technical foul against him. For his part, Arabadjian has denied that his gesture was intended to instruct McMillen to back away from Edeshko, but only for him to stop his hands from crossing the end line, the miscommunication being attributable to the fact he did not speak any English.\nIn any event, McMillen's repositioning left no American defender to challenge Edeshko's pass. Unlike the previous play, where he had been forced to make a short pass into the backcourt, Edeshko now had a clear line to throw the ball the length of the court toward Alexander Belov. Edeshko would later confirm that McMillen's backing away made it easy for him to throw the long pass downcourt. In the Soviet Union, Edeshko's throw would eventually come to be known as \"the golden pass\".\nThe images of the play broadcast on American television by the ABC network have led to the question of whether Edeshko might have stepped on the end line—meaning that he should have been called for a violation—as he made his pass.\nAs Edeshko's full-court pass came down, Belov, Kevin Joyce and Jim Forbes all leapt for the ball near the basket. Belov caught the ball in the air, and as the three men landed, Joyce's momentum carried him out of bounds, while Forbes came down off-balance and fell to the floor beneath the basket. Belov then gathered himself and made an uncontested layup, scoring the winning points as the horn sounded for the last time. After jubilantly sprinting to the other end of the court, Belov was mobbed by his delirious teammates who dogpiled atop him in celebration. American coaches and players argued with the game officials for several minutes, but to no avail, as the Soviets were declared the victors.\nUnited States protest.\nBy some accounts, at the end of the game, Righetto refused to sign the official scoring sheet in an act of protest. Herbert Mols, serving as the resident manager of the U.S. team, and U.S. Olympic Basketball Committee chairman MK Summers, filed a detailed protest, which was heard by FIBA's five-member jury of appeal. Mols and Summers contended that the final three seconds of the 40-minute game were consumed by the two seconds that elapsed on the first inbounds play and the one second that elapsed on the second play, thus marking the legal end of the game at that point and a United States victory by the score of 50–49. The protest asserted that allowing a third inbounds play with the clock reset to three seconds brought the total elapsed game time to 40 minutes and three seconds, in violation of FIBA rules which specified the length of a game to be 40 minutes. The jury ultimately voted down the protest and awarded the gold medals to the Soviet team. At the ensuing press conference, Mols engaged in an animated argument with the jury's chairman, Ferenc Hepp of Hungary, about the propriety of resetting the clock to three seconds. Tenschert also angrily dissented with the jury's ruling, declaring, \"Under FIBA rules, the United States won.\"\nIn announcing the verdict, Hepp steadfastly refused to provide the specifics of the vote count, acknowledging only that the decision was not unanimous. With three of the five jury members, including Hepp, being from Soviet-allied nations, this fueled speculation that the tally had been 3–2 and perhaps based more upon Cold War politics than upon the FIBA rulebook. This view was further suggested when jury members Rafael Lopez and Claudio Coccia — from US-allied Puerto Rico and Italy, respectively — each reportedly confirmed having voted for the United States, thus indicating that pro-Soviet votes could have come only from Hepp of Hungary, Adam Bagłajewski of Poland, and Andres Keiser of Cuba. Nonetheless, Hepp, the only one who had seen all five votes of the secret ballot, maintained his refusal to divulge the specific votes of any of the panel members, beyond later granting that his own vote was in favor of the Soviets. Despite this absence of confirmation from Hepp, it has become generally accepted and reported as fact that there indeed was a 3–2 vote that matched the political alliances of the time. Aside from potential political motivations, Mols suggested that panel members feared retribution from Jones were they to have deemed his decision regarding the game clock to be incorrect. In any event, the U.S. players did not accept the jury's verdict, voting unanimously to refuse their silver medals, and the team did not attend the medal ceremony. The silver medals are still kept in a vault in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nAfter the conclusion of the games, the United States Olympic Committee launched another appeal, this time to the executive committee of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It received the support of Righetto, who was quoted saying the Soviet victory was \"completely irregular, and outsides the rules of the game of basketball\". Righetto criticized Jones's insistence that the clock be reset to three seconds, and offered that he felt it would have been more fair to have instead resumed play with only the one second on the clock that had been remaining when play was suspended. Righetto also asserted that the initial confusion was partially attributable to a language barrier, as he, a Brazilian, spoke Portuguese, but those working the scorer's table spoke only German. Also supporting the U.S. appeal was Chopard, who noted that in his 12 years of service as a timekeeper, Jones' order to put elapsed time back onto the clock was unprecedented. The appeal was unsuccessful, however, as in February 1973, the IOC ruled that matter fell under FIBA's jurisdiction.\nAftermath.\nIn the ensuing years, USA Basketball has periodically contacted the 1972 U.S. team members on behalf of the IOC to offer them the opportunity to change their stance and accept the silver medals, possibly being granted an official ceremony awarding them. In 1992, team member Ed Ratleff said that although he did not personally want the medal, his wife felt very strongly about his accepting it and being able to show it to their children. He said that his vote would be to accept the medal, but that he was casting his vote that way only in deference to her wishes. In a 2012 interview with Todd Jones of \"The Columbus Dispatch\", Ratleff emphasized that the desire to accept the silver medal was his wife's, not his. Since divorced, he affirmed his intention never to accept it. The ten remaining team members each told the magazine that they would vote to refuse the acceptance of silver medals.\nWith regard to awarding the medals, the IOC has insisted that for such an action, the entire team would need to consent unanimously. Kenny Davis reported that he had gone so far as to have a clause put into his will forbidding his wife, children or descendants from ever accepting the silver medal after his death. In 2012, Davis organized a reunion of the 12 team members—the first time they had all been together since 1972—and reported that after some discussion, the group was unanimous in its rejection of the silver medals. \"In basketball, there's one winner,\" he said. \"By the rules of that game, we won.\" The gathering included a group round-table interview of the players that was documented in the ESPN \"30 for 30\" short film \"Silver Reunion\".\nWhen the IOC chose to resolve the figure skating scandal at the 2002 Winter Olympics by awarding duplicate gold medals to the original silver medalists, Tom McMillen, who had gone on to become a United States congressman, appealed to the IOC, requesting that the committee revisit its 1972 decision to declare the U.S. team to be the silver medalists of the men's basketball event. The 2002 decision arose because a French judge had been unduly pressured by the Russian officials to inflate the scores of the Russian pair. The American appeal argued that Jones' unauthorized intervention in 1972 brought similar undue pressure upon the officiating crew of that game. According to McMillen, the IOC did not respond to his appeal.\nIn the Soviet Union, the outcome of the game was heralded and the players celebrated as heroes, with comparatively little attention given to the controversy surrounding the team's victory. When asked about the subject, Soviet team members have indicated that they view their triumph as having been achieved legitimately. Edeshko and Sergei Belov, in particular, have been critical of the Americans for refusing to accept having lost, with Edeshko saying that he regrets that others may feel the Soviets' gold medals were undeserved, but that he harbors no such doubts himself. From his perspective as coach, Kondrashin acknowledged that the controversy did somewhat diminish his enjoyment of the triumph. However, he still cited the victory as the greatest accomplishment of his basketball career.\nCultural references.\nThe game and its controversies are presented from a Russian point of view as part of the 2017 Russian sport drama film \"Going Vertical\" ().\nThe game is also featured from an American point of view in the ESPN documentaries \"Silver Reunion\" (2013; part of \"30 for 30\"), and Episode 2 of \"\" (2018)."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2016)",
        "text": "The 2016 Royal Rumble was the 29th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on January 24, 2016, at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. The event was also the fifth Royal Rumble pay-per-view to be held in the state of Florida, after the 1990, 1991, 1995, and 2006 events, the second to be held in Orlando (after 1990), and WWE's first pay-per-view event to be held at the Amway Center.\nTraditionally since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2016 event, however, Roman Reigns was scheduled to defend the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the 2016 Royal Rumble match and as the number one entrant. This was the main event match, which was won by the returning Triple H, who eliminated Reigns before lastly eliminating Dean Ambrose to win the championship. This was Triple H's second Royal Rumble win and he became the third person to win the match as the number 30 entrant. This was only the second time that a Royal Rumble winner won the world championship for winning the eponymous match, after the 1992 event, where the vacant title was the prize, however, it was the first in which the reigning champion defended the title in the match.\nFive other matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. The event was notable for the WWE pay-per-view debut of longtime Total Nonstop Action Wrestling mainstay AJ Styles as the third entrant in the Royal Rumble match. This was also the last Royal Rumble event to be held before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2016 event was the 29th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 24, 2016, at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. In addition to airing on PPV, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2016, that would have been a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32; however, reigning WWE World Heavyweight Champion Roman Reigns was scheduled to defend the title in the match as the number one entrant. This marked the second time that the promotion's world championship was the prize of the match (the first being in 1992), but the first time in which the champion defended the title in the match, as in 1992, the championship had been vacated, and it was decided that the Rumble winner would win the vacant title.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a match or a series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nTraditionally, the winner of the 30-man Royal Rumble match is awarded a world championship match at WrestleMania. However, as a culmination of his attempts to deprive the WWE World Heavyweight Champion Roman Reigns for attacking his son-in-law Triple H and overall disrespecting the McMahon family, WWE CEO and Chairman Vince McMahon decided that Reigns would have to defend his title in the Rumble match as entrant number one.\nOn the December 28 episode of \"Raw\", Big Show was the first wrestler to announce his participation in the Royal Rumble match. Early in January, Curtis Axel, Ryback, The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, and Braun Strowman), Dolph Ziggler, Chris Jericho, Stardust, and Sheamus were added to the match. On the January 11 episode of \"Raw\", Stephanie McMahon announced that Brock Lesnar would compete in the match in spite of Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman arguing that Lesnar should bypass the match and face the winner at WrestleMania 32. The next week on \"Raw\", a rigged lottery assigned the #1 spot to Reigns, meaning that he would be the first contestant to enter the match.\nAt , Dean Ambrose defeated Kevin Owens to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Their rivalry intensified for over weeks; including a match ending in a double countout for the Intercontinental Championship. On the January 14 episode of \"SmackDown\", Owens accepted Ambrose's challenge to a Last Man Standing match for the Intercontinental Championship at the Royal Rumble.\nOn the January 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", John Cena introduced Kalisto as an opponent for United States Champion Alberto Del Rio. After Kalisto won the match, he was granted a title match on the January 11 episode of \"Raw\", in which he defeated Del Rio to win the United States Championship. Del Rio went on to win back the championship the following night on \"SmackDown\". Subsequently, another title match between the two was scheduled for the Royal Rumble.\nOn the January 4 episode of \"Raw\", Becky Lynch was attacked by Divas Champion Charlotte after defeating her in a non-title match. With the help of father Ric Flair, Charlotte defeated Lynch to retain the championship on the January 7 episode of \"SmackDown\". Subsequently, Lynch challenged Charlotte for another title match at the Royal Rumble. Though Charlotte was unwilling to grant Lynch another title opportunity, Lynch goaded Flair to accept the challenge on his daughter's behalf.\nOn the January 11 episode of \"Raw\", The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Big E, with Xavier Woods) in a non-title match. The following week on \"Raw\", a title match between the two teams was scheduled for the Royal Rumble.\nOn January 20, a fatal four-way tag team match between Darren Young and Damien Sandow, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor), and Mark Henry and Jack Swagger was scheduled for the Royal Rumble pre-show, with both members of the winning team earning a spot in the Royal Rumble match later in the night.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nOn the Royal Rumble kickoff pre-show, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), Jack Swagger and Mark Henry, Damien Sandow and Darren Young, and The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor) competed in a fatal four-way tag team match, in which the winners would qualify for the Royal Rumble match. In the end, Bubba Ray and D-Von performed a 3-D on Viktor before Swagger applied a Patriot Lock on Bubba Ray whilst Henry performed a Running Splash on Bubba Ray. Henry pinned Viktor, allowing Swagger and Henry to qualify for the Royal Rumble match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Dean Ambrose defending the Intercontinental Championship against Kevin Owens in a Last Man Standing match. During the match, Owens performed a Cannonball through the barricade on Ambrose. Owens attempted a Powerbomb on Ambrose through two chairs but Ambrose countered with a Back Body Drop through the chairs. Ambrose performed Dirty Deeds on Owens on a chair. Ambrose performed a Diving Elbow Drop on Owens through a table. Owens performed a Swinging Fisherman Suplex off the top rope on Ambrose through a table. In the end, Ambrose pushed Owens off the top rope through two tables stacked outside the ring. As Owens could not stand by a ten count, Ambrose won the match to retain the title.\nNext, The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) (accompanied by Xavier Woods) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso). In the closing moments of the match, Big E tackled Jimmy into the barricade, only for Jey to perform a Superkick on Big E. Jey leapt to the top rope but was caught by Big E, who performed a Big Ending on Jey to retain the titles.\nAfter that, Alberto Del Rio defended the United States Championship against Kalisto. During the match Del Rio attempted a double foot stomp on Kalisto whilst he was held in the tree of woe, but Kalisto avoided it and executed a Salida Del Sol, however, Del Rio grabbed the ropes to void the pinfall. In the end, as Del Rio removed the padding from a turnbuckle, Kalisto performed a Diving Hurricanrana on Del Rio, knocking Del Rio into the exposed turnbuckle. Kalisto performed a second Salida Del Sol on Del Rio to win the title.\nIn the fourth match, Charlotte defended her Divas Championship against Becky Lynch. In the climax of the match, as Lynch applied the Dis-arm-her on Charlotte, Ric Flair threw his jacket onto Lynch. Lynch threw the jacket only for Charlotte to execute a Spear on Lynch to retain the championship. After the match, Sasha Banks returned and applied the Bank Statement on Charlotte. Flair pulled Charlotte out of the ring.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the 30-man Royal Rumble match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. WWE World Heavyweight Champion Roman Reigns and Rusev began the match as the number one and number two entrants, respectively. After Reigns eliminated Rusev, AJ Styles entered at number three, marking Styles's WWE pay-per-view debut, and eliminated the next entrants, Tyler Breeze and Curtis Axel, the latter of who was attacked by Erick Rowan a year earlier. On orders of WWE chairman Vince McMahon, the League of Nations (Sheamus, Rusev, and Alberto Del Rio) pulled Reigns out of the ring and attacked him, where Rusev performed a Running Splash on Reigns through a broadcast table, causing an injured Reigns to be taken backstage.\nAs the match continued, Braun Strowman eliminated Kane and Big Show. Kevin Owens eliminated AJ Styles but was later eliminated by Sami Zayn, who was a surprise entrant at number twenty. Brock Lesnar eliminated Jack Swagger and three members of the Wyatt Family: Erick Rowan, Luke Harper, and Braun Strowman. When Bray Wyatt entered, The Wyatt Family attacked Lesnar again and eliminated him from the match. Whilst Sheamus entered, Reigns attacked him with a Superman Punch before returning to the match. Reigns then eliminated The Miz and Alberto Del Rio.\nAt number thirty, Triple H, who had been inactive since being attacked by Roman Reigns at TLC, made his return and eliminated Dolph Ziggler. Sheamus performed a Brogue Kick on Wyatt and, together with Triple H, eliminated Wyatt. Chris Jericho was eliminated by Dean Ambrose. Sheamus attempted another Brogue Kick on Ambrose; however, Ambrose countered and Sheamus fell onto the ring apron. Reigns eliminated Sheamus after a Superman Punch only for Triple H to eliminate him. After a back-and-forth shuffle, Triple H eliminated Ambrose, resulting in Triple H winning his second Royal Rumble and becoming WWE World Heavyweight Champion for the ninth time, and a 14-time World Champion overall.\nReception.\nThe event received generally positive reviews, with most commentators praising the undercard (particularly the Last Man Standing match between Dean Ambrose and Kevin Owens) and noting a marked improvement in the titular match from the 2014 and 2015 events.\nSome of the reviewers were more critical of the event, such as John Powell of \"Slam! Wrestling\" rating the match a 6-out-of-10 match, expressing his disappointment in the outcome of the main event match which he felt represented WWE \"going out of their way to frustrate fans and keep their product in a continued state of uninspired monotony\". Powell claimed that it \"had its moments here and there\" but also noting inconsistencies with the past 28 matches, such as allowing Roman Reigns to rejoin after \"missing the majority of the match\". The Intercontinental title match was the best rated on the show at 8.5 out of 10, and was described as a \"very brutal affair with Owens and Ambrose hammering each other into oblivion with chairs, kendo sticks and tables\". The tag title match was called \"standard, hum-drum\" and rated 5 out of 10; the United States title match was \"a classic David vs. Goliath encounter\", rated 6 out of 10, and the women's title match was described as \"unexceptional\" with a poor ending, rated 3 out of 10. The pre-show match was also rated 3 out of 10, described as a \"snorefest\" and a \"mess\". Lastly, Powell described AJ Styles' re-debut as \"one of the highlights of the night\", and noted the positive crowd responses to Becky Lynch and Damien Sandow.\nDave Scherer of \"PWInsider\" wrote that the opening match for the Intercontinental Championship was \"an awesome spectacle, with really good psychology mixed in\" as \"it felt like they hated each other\". Scherer added that the tag title match was \"a lot of fun\", and the United States title match \"good, if you can appreciate Lucha\", otherwise \"a lot of Kalisto's offense isn't believable\". Scherer expressed mild disappointment towards the Divas Championship match, writing that it was not an \"NXT style match\", and described Ric Flair forcibly kissing Becky Lynch as \"sexual assault\". For the Royal Rumble match, Scherer, according to him, noted that the booking of the match turned the crowd against Roman Reigns, writing that \"Vince thought he booked [the Rumble] for the people to cheer for Reigns\", but that \"the Orlando crowd made Triple H the \"face\". Scherer added that he was not surprised at Triple H's entry and win of the main event.\nJames Montgomery of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"the Royal Rumble was an entertaining show, paced by the battle royal and bolstered by its undercard\". He described the opening match as \"a thoroughly entertaining I.C. battle\" and the tag-team title match as \"a creative match that had its moments, but hopefully signaled the end of this feud\". He described the United States Championship bout as \"a hard-hitting match that featured a great false finish\", and expressed his desire for Kalisto to have \"an extended run\" with it. For the Royal Rumble match, Montgomery wrote that it was a \"pretty good Rumble. Storylines began and advanced.\" He described the arrival of AJ Styles as \"surreal\" and praised Dean Ambrose's performance, writing that \"his future appears to be brightening by the minute\". However, he expressed disappointment at the use of Brock Lesnar in the match and added that \"Triple H's victory at the Royal Rumble will no doubt cool some folks' reactions to the event as a whole\".\nJames Caldwell of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" praised the Intercontinental Championship match, writing: \"What a match. Just a nonstop battle capturing the story of this feud\" and rating it as 4 and a quarter stars out of five. Caldwell rated the tag-team title match at 2 and a quarter stars out of five, describing it as \"an up-and-down match with the main issue of no reason to view New Day as heels\". He gave the United States Championship match 2 and three-quarters out of 5, calling it as a \"solid, unspectacular singles match\", and wrote that the Divas Championship match \"was more of a bridge to what was next\" in reference to the appearance of Sasha Banks. Caldwell gave the Rumble main event 3 and three-quarters out of 5, commenting that there were \"overall, too many downpoints for this year's Rumble hurting some up-points\". He wrote that \"the Rumble started really well, got ridiculous in the middle with the now-annual compromise of the Rumble, and ended with the crowd not sure what to do with the players in the mix outside of Ambrose\".\nWill Pruett of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" described the event as \"a delightful show from beginning to end\". The Rumble match was described as \"very fun\" and the best since 2010. Pruett raised questions over the booking of Roman Reigns, noting that he \"failed to truly be heroic\" twice at the event. In comparison, Pruett felt that Triple H came across being the \"conquering hero\" and \"avenging party\" in the storyline against Reigns. Regarding Dean Ambrose, Pruett felt he \"was presented as more of a star on this show than he has been in a long time\", commenting that \"unlike Roman Reigns, who walked away, Ambrose fought hard and still kept fighting to the end\". He described the opening match between Ambrose and Owens as \"insane\". Pruett wrote that the re-debuting AJ Styles \"instantly seemed like he fit on the roster\", but noted that he was \"not presented in the upper echelon of WWE\". For other matches, Pruett called Kalisto's win \"a major surprise\"; while lamenting that \"the lines of the WWE women's division were blurred once again\" as to who fans should support between Sasha Banks and Charlotte after their post-match antics.\nKyle Johnson of the \"Wrestling Observer\" specifically analyzed the merits of the Royal Rumble match. While not \"one of the greatest\", it achieved two \"key things that any good Rumble should\": firstly helping to \"advance or create undercard storylines heading into Wrestlemania\", secondly helping to \"generate a handful of legitimate title contenders for the year to follow\": Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt, Kevin Owens and AJ Styles. For the negatives, Johnson highlighted storyline irregularities: Triple H winning cleanly without any \"underhanded advantage\"; Reigns \"voluntarily\" leaving a title match, returning later \"not selling any injuries whatsoever\", the League of Nations not eliminating Reigns; and no Lesnar rampage post-elimination.\nAppraisals.\nHall of Famer Bret Hart gave a strongly negative appraisal of the show, ranking the match as \"one of the least exciting\" in history, and the overall event as perhaps \"the worst Royal Rumble\". He said of Triple H's WWE World Heavyweight Championship win in the Rumble match \"I didn't like the decision that Triple H, surprise, put the belt on himself again... it just showed a real lack of imagination if you ask me\".\nAftermath.\nOn the following episode of \"Raw\", The Authority decided that Triple H would defend the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32 against the winner of a triple threat match between Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Brock Lesnar at Fastlane. Reigns won the match (and the title opportunity at WrestleMania) by pinning Ambrose. However, Ambrose also received a title match in the run-up to WrestleMania, at WWE Roadblock, where Triple H defeated him to retain the championship. Prior to his triple threat match with Reigns and Lesnar at Fastlane, Ambrose lost the Intercontinental Championship to Kevin Owens in a fatal five-way match on the February 15 episode of \"Raw\", though Ambrose was not involved in the decision.\nThe Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) had another confrontation with WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods), after the latter team interrupted The Usos' cousin, The Rock, who appeared on the January 25 episode of \"Raw\". The Usos forced the trio into the ring, where The Rock attacked each member with his signature moves. On the February 8 episode of \"Raw\", The Usos and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) defeated The New Day and Mark Henry in an eight-man tag team match. After the match, The Dudley Boyz attacked The Usos, turning heels in the process.\nAlso, on the January 25 episode of \"Raw\", AJ Styles made his debut on \"Raw\", defeating Chris Jericho. The two shook hands after the match but Jericho refused to release Styles' hand while giving him a staredown before leaving. After Styles defeated The Miz on the February 4 episode of \"SmackDown\", Jericho challenged Styles to a rematch. Jericho defeated Styles on the episode of \"SmackDown\" of the following week, giving Styles his first loss since the Royal Rumble. On the February 15 episode of \"Raw\", Styles challenged Jericho to a third match at Fastlane, which Jericho accepted on the following \"SmackDown\".\nSasha Banks and Becky Lynch additionally faced each other on the January 25 episode of \"Raw\" in a match which ended in disqualification after Charlotte attacked them. After Banks confirmed her intentions of going after the Divas Championship and split from Team B.A.D. on the February 1 \"Raw\", she faced Lynch that night in a rematch which ended with Banks winning by disqualification after Team B.A.D. members Naomi and Tamina attacked her, turning her face in the process. Lynch helped Banks fend off Naomi and Tamina, leading to a temporary and uneasy alliance between the two. This led to a tag team match pitting Banks and Lynch against Tamina and Naomi at Fastlane. \nAlso on the February 1 episode of \"Raw\", Alberto Del Rio invoked his rematch clause to face Kalisto for the United States Championship at Fastlane. The match was scheduled for the Kickoff pre-show, and stipulated as a two out of three falls match.\nThe 2016 Royal Rumble was the last Royal Rumble to occur before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July, which again split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. As such, another world championship was introduced. After the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE Championship, the WWE Universal Championship was introduced for Raw."

The men's league has five teams in Nova Scotia and one in New Brunswick, and the women's league has four teams in Nova Scotia and one in New Brunswick. The ECJLL operates from May to July, with playoff teams competing yearly for the Garnet Knight Cup (for males) or the East Coast Cup (for females). \nHistory.\nThe league formed in 2004 with five inaugural teams for its first season, the Dartmouth Bandits, Halifax Northwest Rebels, Halifax Southwest Hurricanes, Moncton Mavericks, and Sackville Wolves. \nA second-tier \"B\" league was added in 2012 with Eastern Shore Breakers, St. Margaret's Bay Storm and Truro Bearcats competing against \"B\" teams from Halifax Northwest, Moncton and Sackville. This league was operational for only two years with St. Margaret's ceasing operation after the 2012 season and Sackville failing to finish their 2013 season.\nOnly four teams competed in the league in 2014, with the Moncton Mavericks going on hiatus for the duration of the season. Halifax Northwest rebranded as the Northwest Marley Lions. The Mavericks returned in 2015 along with a new team, the Truro-based Mi'kmaq Warriors. In 2016, the Mavericks changed their name from Moncton to the New Brunswick Mavericks.\nThe 2018 season saw the Halifax Northwest Marley Lions withdraw from play and a dispersal draft spread their players throughout the remaining teams on a one-year release. The ECJLL operated as a five team league for the duration of the season.\nPrior to the 2019 season, Halifax Northwest moved to St. Margaret's Bay and rebranded once again as the St. Margaret's Bay Rebels. Previously dispersed players were recalled and the St. Margaret's Bay Rebels began operation, restoring the league to six teams. \nThe 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe league completed a shortened 2021 season with 5 teams, as the New Brunswick Mavericks were unable to compete due to Covid-19 restrictions.

The Halifax Hurricanes and Sackville Wolves tied in the standings with identical 10-2 records, but Halifax was awarded first place by virtue of the tie-breaking formula. The Sackville Wolves defeated Eastern Shore Breakers 2-0 in a best-of-three semi-finals and went on to face the Halifax Hurricanes in the finals. Halifax did not allow a goal against in their two shutout wins to take the first-ever ECJLL Female Division Championship and the East Coast Cup.\nIn the 2023 season, Halifax Hurricanes and Sackville Wolves once again tied in the standings with identical 9-3 records. Halifax was awarded first place in the tie-breaking formula.

        "text": "Ricky S. Moore (born April 10, 1976) is an American former basketball player and current coach. He previously served as an assistant at the University of Connecticut (UConn). He played professionally for eleven years.\nMoore came to UConn after an All-American high school career at Westside High School in Augusta, Georgia. He was a three-time co-captain for the Huskies, including the school's first national championship team in 1998–99. That year, Moore averaged 6.8 points and 3.6 assists per game. In the 1999 National Championship game, Moore's defense on Duke's William Avery, and his ability to guard Trajan Langdon in the final seconds, was seen as one of the keys to the Huskies defeat of the heavily favored Blue Devils and Moore was named to the All-Final Four team.\nAfter graduation, Moore played professionally in the United States, Austria, Ukraine, Sweden, Turkey, and Germany over eleven seasons.\nIn 2010, Moore retired as a player and joined the coaching staff at Dartmouth College as an assistant. In 2012, he left for an opening as an administrative assistant at his alma mater, UConn, working for fellow Husky alum Kevin Ollie. In 2013, he was promoted to a full assistant role and helped lead the Huskies to the 2013–14 National Championship. Moore stayed at UConn until 2018, when head coach Ollie was dismissed because of an NCAA investigation.\nHe then coached in AAU. In June 2021, Moore was named head boys' basketball coach at Northwest_Cabarrus_High_School in Kannapolis, North Carolina."

        "title": "Rugby league in Solomon Islands",
        "text": "The Solomon Islands national rugby league team represents Solomon Islands in the sport of rugby league football. They are, in fact, planning a top-level tournament in 2010–11, after the capital of Honiara hosts an inter-city exhibition league, the Honiara Rugby League; expected in August 2009 but now it seems early 2010 will be the most convenient point for when it will be held after an uphold in the delivery of the participating teams jerseys caused delays. They are an unaffiliated nation and were recognised by the RLIF as having official observer status in early 2009. They are scheduled to participate in their first-ever test match against a touring New South Wales Police Team in November 2010.\nEarly development (1999–2000).\nIn 1999, the Solomon Islands Rugby League Federation started the game on the Islands to provide youngsters and a wider range of people with interest in the game an optional game to rugby union. The Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League aided Solomon Islands by sending their more experienced officials to oversee the development of the game in its early, less popular stage. The RLIF also sent out officials to Solomon Islands, but as Solomon Islands were not members of the RLIF in these early years and were not playing or organising the game in any official format, they were sent out as observatory officials, as opposed to the development officers that are in place now. These officials conducted the incursion of the game by advertising the excitement and enjoyability of the game to youngsters. However, with political disputes and with the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League removing their support for the game on the Islands, the game failed to advance any further and its observation ceased.\nRe-introduction (2008) and onward development.\n2008.\nFor the best part of 10 years, the game in Solomon Islands was virtually completely frozen. However, in 2008, the RLIF offered the Island a re-building programme to restart the game at both grass-roots levels in schools and by means of Sunday leagues, and at open age, with the SIRLF planning a league in Honiara (later to be confirmed to be known as the Honiara Rugby League). In 2008, it was announced that there would be a competition in Solomon Islands, to immediately initiate a desire to participate and win in the game. The Honiara Rugby League Association was founded in 2008 in order for the game in the city to be spread independently, whilst the SIRLF concentrated on the rest of the Solomon Islands. An Australian sports management business, Global League Management, who specifically aid developing rugby league nations offered to provide assistance to Solomon Islands. Global League Management's Chairman, Dane Campbell (himself a former half-back with Newcastle Knights) said: \"I’m hopeful to be able to put into contact with the Solomon Islands rugby league to offer our assistance to them in their development process.\" It was also anticipated that the SIRLF (Solomon Islands Rugby League Federation) will again strike a partnership with the game in Papua New Guinea in 2008 to aid development of the game in both nations, but particularly in Solomon Islands. It is also anticipated that SIRLF will form a collaboration with the Solomon Islands Rugby Union (SIRU) to develop the game further. These developments also led to a planned bid to join the RLIF.\n2009.\nIn February 2009, the RLIF said that it would pay particular attention to how well the game was developing on the Islands, and said that it would go about this by sending equipment, advisers and development officers later in the year. RAMSI officers, known as \"Matt\" and \"Graeme\", agreed to coach both the Honiara sides in the Islands' maiden game, the inter-city Honiara tournament and the tour match against New South Wales Police. It was also confirmed in February that the RLIF would send people from the Rugby League Academy of Australia in order to support the games' development. President of the SIRLF William Tuhaika said of this agreement: \"They are sending sports equipments and development resources manuals. The RLIF also pledges to send two educators and instructors to conduct the proposed development course (coaching/refereeing).\" In June 2009, also, there was a refereeing course on the Islands to provide people with the opportunity to learn about what it takes to become a first-grade official. It was compromised by teachers and amateur club representatives and was conducted by Peter Corcoran – New South Wales Rugby League educational director and an AFP (Australian Federal Police) officer.\n The first ever game on the Islands was played in June 2009 when a combined Eastern and Central Honiara took on West Honiara. This was to evaluate a side for the exhibition game to take place in November to play the New South Wales Police Force. Tuhaika said of this test match: \"At least two technical people from Australian Rugby League will come over to help prepare the national side for this proposed historic event.\" A new stadium was built in 2009, specifically for rugby, and will act as home for both codes of rugby in the Islands.\n2010.\nThe test match against the touring New South Wales Police team, has been scheduled for November 2010. The game is likely to be played at the new, dual-code \"Town Ground\" stadium in Honiara. This is in addition to the delayed Honiara competition, the HRL which will act as a selection league for this game. There will also be a junior rugby league competition in Honiara, coinciding with the open-age tournament. The game is also looking to reach out to the women of the Islands to play and hope that a tag tournament can be formed in 2010. The Pacific regional associate of the Rugby League International Federation, the Pacific Islands Rugby League Federation was formed in 2010, with the aim of aiding developing \"Pacific Rim\" nations such as Solomon Islands via the other, more developed Pacific nations, such as New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.\nGoverning body.\nThe Solomon Islands Rugby League Federation are the governing body for rugby league in Solomon Islands. Officially founded in 2008 after being an unofficial body from 1999, they conduct the incursion of the game in Solomon Islands on behalf of the RLIF, and aid the sports development with the distribution of money, equipment and development officers sent by the RLIF. They are part of the Pacific Islands Rugby League Federation, and affiliate members of the Rugby League International Federation.\nMedia efforts.\nEfforts have made to spread the game by televising rugby league with the availability of both the NRL, including its grand final, with most recently the 2009 NRL Grand Final being streamed to the Solomon Islands; and State of Origin via free-to-view television. The World Cup of 2008 also was a way to induce popularity in the game as that too was a chance to see not only international-class rugby, but to influence how far the game has spread, with the involvement of nations such as Ireland and Fiji – as well as Papua New Guinea who offered their support to the Island during their initial development period. The game is also widespread via newspapers such as \"The Solomon Star\" and \"The Solomon Times\" which feature results from Australia (i.e. NRL, Queensland and New South Wales Cups and the National Youth Competition where Solomon players play sparingly), financial and sporting development nationally and individual successes from the Islands; such as Gerard Tema who was selected to play for Brisbane in early 2009.\nCompetitions.\nIt has been anticipated that within the next few years of development that Solomon Islands would be in a position to launch a bid to participate in the World Cup. Rugby League International Federation Development Officer and ex-Penrith, Canterbury-Bankstown and Paris Châtillon XIII player Tas Baitieri said: \"Other Pacific Islands countries played rugby league for 14 years before making it to the World Cup. Being familiar with the rugby league by watching other countries playing the code, Solomon Islands can pick up and make it in less than 14 years.\" The SIRLF had announced that they would select players to compete in the Cook Islands 7s in 2009. However, the competition that included teams from across the Pacific Nations did not feature a Solomon Islands team. This is in addition to the inter-city tournament, the Honiara Rugby League (HRL) – which will feature 4 amateur teams and players from across Honiara. There will be two teams from the West and one each from the East and Central areas. SIRLF President William Tuhaika said that the purpose of the competition is to give players competitive opportunity to adjust to the new code of rugby on the Islands. He also stated that the league was to make up a national side to play the NSW Police side in October. There are already 60 players signed up to play in this competition for any one of the four sides with more anticipated as registration is still available. However, due to a hold-up in the jerseys being shipped in, from Australia on behalf of the ARL, the tournament looks like it will be delayed shortly. It is said that this will be a platform towards the 2010 tournament that the SIRLF hope will be a national event featuring interested amateur sides from across the Islands. It has also been announced that Tuhaika will attempt to place a bid for Solomon Islands to take part in the Pacific Cup in the near future.\nMini Pacific Sevens issue (2009).\nThe SIRLF had announced their 24-man squad to compete in the Mini Pacific Sevens; held in the Cook Islands in September 2009. However, they were excluded from the tournament for a reason based on the qualification guidelines and criteria. It is presumed that the standard of rugby in Solomon Islands was not experienced, or simply not good enough, to be included in the games. It is possible that if the local competition had been operational then the tournament would have seen a team from Solomon Islands. The query was made by the main organiser of the tournament who requested to the administration of National Olympic Committee of Solomon Islands (NOCSI) that the decision be reversed. However, there was no response and the games were played without Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=\"Pacific Mini Games 2009 – Rugby League 7s/28–29 September\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHoniara Rugby League (HRL) results.\nThe HRL is Solomon Islands' maiden rugby league tournament and is scheduled to take place in 2010.\n\"Results from the upcoming HRL tournament will appear here as and when they are available.\"\nPlayers.\nNotable players.\nThe following is a list of players with Solomon Islands family heritage who are past or present professional or semi-professional players:\nSIRLF 1st meeting.\nOn 10 November 2008 the Solomon Islands Rugby League Federation was officially founded at a meeting at the Environmental Conference room, Honiara. This meeting was also a joint meeting with the Honiara Rugby league Association, and the purpose of their inclusion in the meeting was to initiate their independence in developing the game in the city whilst also finalising the details for the exhibition game between East and Central Honiara and West Honiara.\nThese are the seven officials that were chosen at the meeting on 10 November 2008 to be in the Solomon Islands Rugby League Federation:\nHoniara Rugby League Association officials.\nThe HRLA comprises representatives form Honiara and Solomon Islands, but also Australia, Tonga and Papua New Guinea; areas from which Solomon Islands will be aided:\nSponsorship possibilities.\nThe Solomon Islands Rugby League Federation are currently looking for sponsorship for the game in the country. They also need sponsors for both the HRL and the test match against New South Wales Police. The last time the game was initiated in the Solomon Islands, in 1999, Republic of China, Kossol Car Rental and BP Investments were major supporters of the developments and have, despite the failures of last time's development, expressed an interest to back the game once more."

O'Brien played college basketball at the University of Maryland and at the time he left Maryland he was the team's 6th all-time leading scorer. O'Brien was selected in both the 1973 ABA draft and 1973 NBA draft. The Indiana Pacers, then of the ABA, selected him in the third round, while the Cleveland Cavaliers chose him in NBA's third draft round as well.\nThe New York Nets acquired O'Brien's ABA rights from Indiana in June 1973 and signed him to a one-year guaranteed contract for $100,000. He was cut by the Nets in training camp as Nets' coach Kevin Loughery felt he was too heavy and too slow. He played semi-pro ball for Trenton in the Eastern League for a few months while getting paid by and practicing with the Nets. He was brought back to the Nets in January 1974 while a few Nets' players were injured and Loughery stated at the time that O'Brien was in much better condition than he was during training camp. He won the ABA championship in 1973–74 with the Nets. During the 1974 playoffs he only played in 4 games for a total of less than 10 minutes. In the finals he only played in 1 game for 3 minutes but scored 8 points in that short time.\nThe Nets cut O'Brien during 1974 training camp and he was signed by the Memphis Sounds. O'Brien said of being cut by the Nets that: \nI had the feeling I was going to be cut in camp. I thought it was between Al Skinner and me but when Ed Manning arrived and got the playing time I knew I was gone. I didn't panic though. I thought there was a place for me and I am very happy here in Memphis. I'm getting the playing time and I don't care if it's at guard or forward.\nThe Sounds folded after the 1974-75 season and O'Brien signed with the Cavaliers of the NBA, despite having an option year left on his ABA contract. O'Brien was waived by the Cavaliers before the 1975-76 season started."

        "text": "The 2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the finals of the 2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and it determined the national champion for the 2002-03 NCAA Division I men's basketball season The game was played on April 7, 2003 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, and featured the West Regional Champion, #2-seeded Kansas versus the East Regional Champion, #3-seeded Syracuse. This was the first national championship game since 1989 to not feature a team from either the ACC or SEC.\nParticipants.\nSyracuse Orangemen.\nThings did not start well for Syracuse. Guards DeShaun Williams and James Thues both left the team. Williams transferred to Iona while Thues left for Detroit. Freshman point guard Billy Edelin was suspended for 12 games for participating in a non-sanctioned basketball league. Syracuse then started its season with a loss against Memphis, despite Carmelo Anthony's 27 points, a then-high for a Syracuse freshman debut.\nBut things turned around, as Syracuse went 13–3 in the Big East, with several memorable wins. Gerry McNamara would establish himself as a clutch player, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82–80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In an upset of then-No. 24 Syracuse over then-No. 2 Pittsburgh, McNeil, a career 49.1% free throw shooter, hit two key free throws, and added a game-winning tip in a 67–65 upset.\nThe Orangemen would play five Big 12 teams throughout the year, including games against Missouri in the regular season, and against Oklahoma (Elite Eight), Oklahoma State (second round), Texas (National Semifinal) and then Kansas (National Championship game).\nKansas Jayhawks.\nKansas would get off to a rough start as they lost both games in the championship round of the 2002 Preseason NIT to North Carolina and #7 Florida. After dropping a game to #7 Oregon at the Rose Garden, Kansas would go on a 10-game winning streak which was highlighted by home victories over UCLA and Kansas State. Kansas then would suffer two consecutive losses to Colorado and #1 Arizona and would then go on a seven-game winning streak which included victories over #3 Texas, #21 Missouri Tigers men's basketball, and Kansas State, but that streak would end with a loss at #5 Oklahoma. Kansas would win their final four games of the regular season which was highlighted by victories over #16 Oklahoma State and Missouri. Kansas would win one game in the Big 12 Tournament before losing to Missouri in the semifinals. Kansas would get off to a slow start in the NCAA Tournament as they barely beat Utah State in the 1st round, but would catch fire during the rest of the NCAA tournament as they romped Arizona State in the 2nd round and would beat Duke and Arizona (avenging a loss from earlier this season) to reach the Final Four and would romp Marquette in the National Semifinals to reach the 2003 National Championship Game.\nGame Summary.\nLeading up to the championship game, much of the conversation revolved around how, no matter the outcome, one of the well-known head coaches would win their first championship. In Jim Boeheim's 27 years as head coach at Syracuse his team had been to two Final Fours, and finished runner-up each time (1987, 1996). Roy Williams, during his fifteen seasons as Kansas head coach, had reached the Final Four four times, and finished runner up once (1991). Syracuse dominated with a hot shooting first half to lead by 11 at the break. Gerry McNamara connected on an impressive six three-pointers in the half, which were his 18 points for the game. Kansas fought back to within 80-78 in the final minute and had a chance to tie after Hakim Warrick missed a pair of free throws in the final moments. Warrick, however, then blocked Michael Lee's three point attempt with 0.7 seconds remaining on the game clock. After Kirk Hinrich's three-pointer at the buzzer went over the net, Syracuse's victory gave them, and Jim Boeheim, their first ever national championship. Carmelo Anthony was named Most Outstanding Player (MOP) with 21 points in the win. Syracuse also avenged a second-round loss to Kansas two years earlier."

        "text": "The girls' individual archery event at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics was held from 22 to 25 August 2014 at the Fangshan Sports Training Base in Nanjing, China. One of three recurve archery events which comprised the archery programme, it was the second time the girls' individual discipline was contested at Summer Youth Olympics. Thirty-two archers from thirty-two countries entered the competition, which was open to female archers born between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 1999. The defending champion was South Korea's Kwak Ye-ji, who was unable to defend her title due to the age limitations imposed on the event.\nLi Jiaman of China defeated France's Melanie Gaubil in a one-arrow shoot-off in the final to win the gold medal. As runner-up Gaubil received the silver medal. South Korea's Lee Eun-gyeong, who was seeded first and set a new junior world record in the 72-arrow round, defeated Ana Machado of Brazil to win the bronze medal.\nFormat.\nThe girls' individual recurve event was an outdoor recurve target archery event. Held to World Archery-approved rules, the archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 60 metres, with between one and ten points being awarded for each arrow depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition took place over three days, with an initial ranking round being followed by a single-elimination tournament consisting of five rounds and concluding with two matches to determine the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals.\nThe ranking round was held on 22 August and determined the seeds for the elimination rounds. Each of the thirty-two archers shot a total of 72 arrows, the archer with the highest scoring total from her 72 arrows receiving the number one seed, the archer with the second highest total receiving second seed, and so on. In the event of a tie between two or more archers, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring of the target was taken into account, with the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 (or X) ring used as a second tiebreaker if necessary.\nThe format of the elimination and medal-deciding rounds followed the Archery Olympic Round set system. The elimination rounds began on 23 August with the 1/16 round and concluded two days later on 25 August, with the bronze and gold medal finals following on the same day. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the greater score from their three arrows won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lower score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to reach six set points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points each after the maximum five sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nRanking round.\nSouth Korea's Lee Eun-gyeong topped the ranking round held on the morning of 22 August with a score of 681 points out of a maximum of 720. Her score set a new world record in the women's cadet category – which is contested by archers aged seventeen and under – by five points, beating the previous record set by Melanie Gaubil one month earlier. Diananda Choirunisa of Indonesia finished second, eight points behind Lee on 673 points, with China's Li Jiaman and Spain's Alicia Marín following on 669 and 664 points respectively. Gaubil ranked fifth and set a personal record with her tally of 663 points, the Frenchwoman competing despite suffering from an inflamed shoulder.\nElimination rounds.\nThe elimination rounds commenced the following day, with the 1/16 round being held over two sessions on Saturday 23 August. The day saw few surprise results with each of the top ten seeded archers advancing to the last sixteen. Bianca Gotuaco of the Philippines was the highest ranked archer to falter in the opening knockout round, the eleventh seed losing to Japan's Miasa Koike in four sets during the afternoon session, which took place under calm and humid conditions. Fourteenth-seed Bryony Pitman of Great Britain was another to be eliminated by a lower-ranked archer in the first round, with the Briton being unable move her sight on either of her two bows to correct her shots, which were landing too low compared to the centre of the target. Her loss to nineteenth-seed Regina Romero of Guatemala would be her first of two in two days, Romero and Belgium's Rick Martens going on to defeat Pitman and her Belorussian partner Aliaksei Dubrova in the mixed team event twenty four hours later.\nAfter the mixed-team competition was contested on 24 August, the girls' individual event resumed on the morning of 25 August for the 1/8 elimination round. Nerves claimed both Romero and Chinese Taipei's Fang Tzu-yun, Romero losing in straight sets to third-seed Li while Fang took Poland's Sylwia Zyzańska to five sets before bowing out after a one-arrow shoot-off. A shoot-off was also required to separate Koike and sixth-seed Viktoriia Oleksiuk and Diananda Choirunisa's tie with Brazil's Ana Machado, Koike and Machado defeating their higher-ranked opponents by each shooting into the central 10-ring.\nThe quarter-finals got underway in the afternoon of 25 August under cloudy skies with an air temperature of 30 °C. Lee, Gaubil, and Li each recorded comfortable victories to advance to the semi-finals, while Machado narrowly defeated tenth-seed Zyzańska in the final quarter-final match, the pair once again requiring a shoot-off to determine the victor. The first semi-final encounter between Lee and Gaubil followed shortly afterwards and ended in a surprise victory for the fifth-seeded Frenchwoman. Although Lee entered the match affected by injury, she was able to match Gaubil's consistency over the first four sets, neither scoring lower than 28 points. A score of 26-25 in the fifth set in Gaubil's favour however sealed the match, the Frenchwoman eliminating the number one seed from gold medal contention. Machado was meanwhile unable to pull off a surprise result of her own, losing to Li by three sets to one.\nMedal matches.\nThe bronze medal match was the first medal encounter to be decided. Lee took a comfortable victory over Machado by seven set points to one, the eighteenth seed able only to match Lee's shooting in the second set where the pair tied on twenty-seven points apiece. Machado's performance was nevertheless considered to have exceeded expectations, the Brazilian herself expressing surprise at how far she progressed in the competition, having returned to the sport just six months prior to the event.\nThe gold medal final was by contrast a close contest. Li and Gaubil each won two sets while tying in the third, forcing the match into a one-arrow shoot-off. Li shot first and scored a ten, while Gaubil's arrow landed wide of the centre of the target into the nine ring, giving Li victory and the gold medal. Li's win earned her a second gold medal of the Games after her victory in the mixed teams competition the previous day with partner Luis Gabriel Moreno of the Philippines. Afterwards Li spoke of the weight of expectation she felt as she prepared for the one-arrow shoot-off, saying \"I felt that my parents, all my family members and the entire country were watching me, so I was really nervous. But I took a few seconds and calmed myself down.\" Gaubil meanwhile reflected that she found the final day of competition difficult with the quarter-final, semi-final, and gold medal match taking place in rapid succession, leaving little time for rest in between."

That consists of a minibus and bicycle trailer for six bicycles.\nOn a number of special occasions since 1993, crossings have been made directly using the bidirectional Channel Tunnel service tunnel, positioned between the two rail tunnel bores. The central service tunnel has airlocks at both ends and a concrete screed road surface.\nConstruction.\nDuring construction, over 200 bicycles were used by construction workers. These consisted of 80 bicycles from Peugeot bicycles on the French side; plus 125 bicycles from Saracen Cycles on the British side. The Saracen mountain bikes had been ordered by plant manager Kevin Otto—an initial order of twenty-five had been ordered with the rest of the fleet following on later. On the UK side, over 850 workers had been trained and issued with passes for their use inside the service tunnel.\nDuring one Sunday in October 1993, Wally Michalski and Mike Turner, working as contractors on the British side, used a pair of the Saracen bicycles to cycle the round-trip from Folkestone to Coquelles and back again. The pair took around five hours to complete the journey, while wearing full overalls and needing to carry respirators.\nIn November 1993, journalists Nick Dutton-Taylor and Damon Brown used the same Saracen bicycles as other construction workers to cycle into the tunnel for an article in \"Mountain Biking UK\". They were trained and accompanied by the cycling trainer Clive, but not allowed to go the full way through.\nAfter opening.\nOn the night of 2/3 December 1994, a group of professional and semi-professional cyclists went road bicycle racing from London to Paris in aid of \"\" broadcast live on French national television. This 1994 peloton was led by Henri Sannier and accompanied by Jean-Michel Guidez, Patrick Chêne, Jean Mamère, Marc Toesca, Thierry Marie, Paul Belmondo, Bernard Darniche, Jean-François Guiborel and others. The group used the service tunnel to cross the channel between Folkestone and Coquelles, accompanied by a STTS vehicle.\nOn 1 June 2014, Chris Froome rode eastbound from England to France in a video promoting Team Sky and publicised during the 2014 Tour de France season, taking 55 minutes to cross.\nOn 9 November 2018, Children in Need's Rickshaw Challenge team rode through the tunnel on the first leg of their journey from Calais to Salford."

        "text": "Park Chan-hee (born April 17, 1987) is a South Korean basketball player for Wonju DB Promy and the South Korean national team.\nEarly life.\nPark grew up in Yeosu and moved to Seoul after his father got a job in Incheon. He first became interested in basketball as an elementary school student after seeing a game broadcast on television. In 2004 he first drew attention after leading Kyungbock High School to win two high school tournaments.\nCollege career.\nDespite receiving offers from Yonsei University and Korea University, Park committed to Kyung Hee University. At that time, Kyung Hee, although well-known for its College of Physical Education, was not considered a major contender in college basketball. He decided on Kyung Hee as he would be guaranteed playing time as a freshman. However, he almost gave up the sport after going through a long slump in form during his sophomore year and then going through surgery on his toe during his junior year. During his senior year, Park was joined by high school seniors and Kyung Hee prospects Kim Jong-kyu and Kim Min-goo. They led Kyung Hee to the semi-finals of the National Basketball Festival, the main collegiate competition at that time, but were knocked out by a Lee Jung-hyun-inspired Yonsei team.\nProfessional career.\nPark was the first overall pick of the 2010 KBL rookie draft and was drafted by Anyang KT&amp;G. It was only the second time in the history of the KBL rookie draft that the first overall pick was not from Yonsei University, Korea University or Chung-Ang University, which are collectively known as the \"big 3\" of domestic college basketball. His rookie season did not begin smoothly as he struggled to adapt to the professional game and Anyang finished second-last in the league table. He averaged 12.0 points and played in 44 out of 54 games. Despite Anyang's poor results, the relatively young squad – which also included guards Kim Tae-sul and Lee Jung-hyun and forward Yang Hee-jong – were highlighted as future stars. Park would go on to win the Rookie of the Year award.\nHe enlisted for mandatory military service in April 2012 and joined the after completing basic training. He was discharged in January 2014.\nPark was traded to Incheon Electroland Elephants for Han Hee-won in 2016. He led them to the play-offs and became the team's main point guard due to injury problems and underwhelming performances from the other starting point guards.\nAt the end of the 2020-21 season, Incheon Electroland Elephants was in the process of being bought over by another company and relocated to another city. Park decided to leave and was traded to Wonju DB Promy together with Kang Sang-jae in exchange for Doo Kyung-min.\nNational team.\nPark was selected for the 2010 Asian Games despite having just turned professional. He has participated in two FIBA World Cups, the 2014 and 2019 editions.\nPersonal life.\nPark has been married since 2015. He and his wife have a son Si-yu (born 2016).\nPark's younger brother Park Chan-woong is a former SPOTV commentator who also played college basketball for Kyung Hee University."

        "text": "Yang Dong-geun (born September 14, 1981) is a South Korean retired basketball player for Ulsan Mobis Phoebus and the Korean national team, where he participated at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. During his sixteen-year career, he won the KBL Rookie of the Year and was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) in KBL four times. He spent his entire playing career with Ulsan Mobis Phoebus, having been at the forefront of Ulsan's dominance in the league from the early 2000's. Since retiring after the 2019-20 season, he has returned to the team as a coach.\nEarly life.\nYang enjoyed playing basketball since his elementary school days. As he had been short compared to his peers, he never considered going professional until he had a late growth spurt and started playing college basketball. He attended Yongsan High School, which is known as a high school basketball powerhouse, but was neither a highly-rated prospect or a regular at that time. One of his contemporaries was Lee Jung-suk, who was a year behind him. He overlooked by the \"big three\" universities in collegiate basketball: Yonsei University, Korea University and Chung-Ang University.\nPlaying career.\nCollege days.\nYang was recruited by Hanyang University despite not being a regular in high school. At that time, Hanyang was not a particularly well-known basketball program and was better known for its baseball team. His close friend and future professional rival Cho Sung-min would join him two years later.\nDuring his senior year, Yang led Hanyang to a runner-up finish at the MBC Cup. He was then thrust into the spotlight for leading Hanyang to a 96-91 upset against Yonsei in the National Basketball Festival (), the other main collegiate competition. Yonsei had been on a 39-game winning streak in the tournament and boasted a star-studded team which included Ha Seung-jin, Kim Tae-sul and Yang Hee-jong. Although Hanyang finished third, Yang ranked first in assists in the competition.\nProfessional career.\nDuring the 2004 KBL rookie draft, Yang made history by becoming the first player not from a \"big three\" college basketball program to be drafted first in the first round. He was selected by Jeonju KCC Egis, who had the first overall pick, but was immediately traded to Ulsan Mobis Phoebus in exchange for two players. There were initial doubts as he was considered short by KBL standards but he established himself as an integral member of the team due to his physicality and accurate shooting and passing. In his debut game, a loss to Seoul Samsung Thunders, he scored 13 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists despite having a distinct height disadvantage. He averaged 11.5 points and 6.1 assists and was named KBL Rookie of the Year.\nYang formed a tandem with foreign recruit Chris Williams and led Ulsan Mobis Phoebus to the 2007 Championship, his first title. During the final, they faced a Busan KTF Magic Wings which had Cho Sung-min and Shin Ki-sung and won four out of seven games in a tightly-contested race. He averaged 19.1 points, 3.4 rebounds and 7.3 assists during the playoffs and was named Playoffs MVP.\nIn May 2007, a week after his wedding and the playoffs, Yang enlisted for mandatory military service. He enlisted together with Cho and they were assigned to the after completing basic training.\nCoaching career.\nYang declared his interest in coaching after retiring as a player and went sent to the United States for a training course. He returned to Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus as a coach under Yoo Jae-hak from the 2021–22 season onwards.\nPersonal life.\nYang married his college classmate Kim Jung-mi in 2007 after a seven-year courtship. They have a son and a daughter.\nYang is an avid baseball fan and is best friends with Lee Bum-ho. He was at Lee's retirement game in 2019.\nYang shares the same name, written with the exact same Hanja characters, as an actor and hip hop artist who is two years older than him. The older Yang is known as an avid basketball fan and posted a retirement tribute on his Instagram to the basketball player quipping that his life as an actor just got started at age forty while a professional athlete's life ended at the same age."

He was schoolmates with Moon Seong-gon and Choi Jun-yong at Kyungbock High School and they were dubbed the \"Kyungbock Trio\" by rival high school teams for their well-rounded offensive capabilities.\nCollege career.\nLee would join Moon, a year his senior, at Korea University while Choi went to rivals Yonsei University. At that time, his teammates also included Kang Sang-jae and Lee Seoung-hyun and they were mostly competing against a Kim Jong-kyu and Kim Min-goo-inspired Kyung Hee University in the U-League. During his freshman year, he played a pivotal role in Korea University winning the MBC Cup for the first time in seventeen years and was named MVP of the tournament.\nHe declared as a prospect in the 2015 NBA draft on April 22, 2015. As an early entrant in the 2015 NBA draft, he went undrafted. He returned to Korea University to continue his college career. During his junior year, he and Kang Sang-jae, dubbed \"Twin Towers\" because of their height, led Korea University to a surprise win over a composed of experienced KBL players fulfilling their mandatory military service.\nProfessional career.\nLee was considered one of the \"big 3\", along with Kang and Choi Jun-yong, of the 2016 KBL rookie draft and strong contenders for the first pick of the first round. He was drafted first overall by Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus. After an underwhelming start to his rookie season, he scored 24 points and 18 rebounds in January against Changwon LG Sakers.\nThroughout 2018 Lee struggled with injury. In February he ruptured his Achilles tendon which effectively ended his season. He spent the off-season in rehabilitation and recovered in time for the 2018–19 season. However, he fractured his left patella in a December game. He was ruled out of the rest of the season as it required surgery.\nIn November 2020, Lee was traded to Goyang Orion Orions for Choi Jin-soo in a player swap.\nNational team career.\nLee was first called up to the senior national team while in college, participating in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. He participated at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the Asian Games that same year. The South Koreans won gold for the first time since 2002, which meant that Lee and his teammates who had yet to enlist for mandatory military service were granted exemptions. He missed out on the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup due to his injury."

        "text": "Cho Sung-min (; born December 23, 1983) is a South Korean retired professional basketball player. He played for Busan KT Sonicboom and Changwon LG Sakers in the Korean Basketball League and was a member of the South Korean national team.\nIn his prime, Cho was considered one of the league's most accurate three-point and free throw shooters, earning the nickname \"Chosun Shooter\" (). He was the free throw percentage leader for four consecutive seasons and is only second to Moon Kyung-eun in the all-time percentage record, successfully scoring 92.3% of his free throws during the 2011–12 season.\nEarly life.\nThe youngest of three children, Cho is a native of Jeonju. He became interested in basketball as an elementary school student due to the popularity of the basketball-themed manga and its animated adaptation \"Slam Dunk\" and the television series \"The Last Match\". He attended Jeonju High School, where he first attracted the attention of scouts for his accurate shooting.\nCollege career.\nCho went on to Hanyang University where he was a junior of future national teammate and best friend Yang Dong-geun. At that time Hanyang was mostly known for its baseball team and its basketball team was still not considered a major contender to the \"big 3\" universities of domestic college basketball: Yonsei University, Korea University and Chung-Ang University. His college career was mostly overshadowed by a star-studded Yonsei team which included Yang Hee-jong, Kim Tae-sul and future 2006 KBL draft first overall pick Jeon Jeong-gyu. He notably scored 32 points in the final of the National Basketball Championships (college division), one of the collegiate tournaments prior to the establishment of the U-League.\nProfessional career.\nBusan KT Sonicboom (2006–2017).\nCho was drafted by Busan KTF Magic Wings in 2006 and was the eighth overall pick. Incidentally, Cho shared the same name as an older baseball player of the same name who had recently divorced popular actress Choi Jin-sil, leading the younger Cho to quip in an interview that he hoped to become famous enough to make the name \"Cho Sung-min\" associated with him and not his older fellow athlete. In his first full season, Cho and veteran point guard Shin Ki-sung formed the backbone of the KTF Magic Wings team which reached the play-off finals to face regular season champions Ulsan Mobis Phoebus, Yang Dong-geun's team. However, Cho had to be stretchered off during Game 6 after colliding with Yang and Shin dedicated the hard-fought win to him. KTF lost the seventh game and Mobis won the Championship.\nUnlike many of his counterparts who generally enlisted for mandatory military service after two or three years, Cho decided to enlist in May 2007, at the end of his rookie season. He and Yang enlisted together and were assigned to the after completing basic training.\nThe 2013–14 season was a record-breaking one for Cho as he became the first guard to rank first in scoring among domestic players. Forwards, including swingmen doubling as shooting guards, and centers had traditionally dominated in the scoring category while scoring-oriented point guards were still relatively uncommon at that time. He also simultaneously ranked first in both the three-point field goal and free throw percentages for a second consecutive season. No other player has accomplished this feat ever since. KT Sonicboom, which had finished second last the previous season, managed to qualify for the play-offs.\nChangwon LG Sakers (2017–2021).\nIn February 2017, it was announced that Cho would be traded to Changwon LG Sakers in exchange for its highest drawn pick of the upcoming rookie draft and forward Kim Young-hwan, who was on the last year of his contract. The move surprised observers and pundits as Cho was then KT Sonicboom's longest-serving player and considered to be the \"face\" of the franchise.\nCho retired at the end of the 2020–21 season. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the club was unable to hold a full retirement ceremony for him. Instead, it was held prior to the first game of the 2021–22 season between his two former teams, LG and KT.\nNational team career.\nAfter his good form during the 2013–14 season, Cho was chosen for the final squad to compete at the 2014 Asian Games, hosted on home soil. Cho stood out for his accuracy in games where the South Korean team was at a disadvantage in terms of height. He hit the game winner in against Iran putting South Korea on top, 79–77.\nCho was part of the final 12-man which competed in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He averaged 6.2 points, 2.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game.\nPersonal life.\nCho lost both of his parents in September 2006 when they were involved in a car accident. He had been in the Los Angeles area for off-season training when they travelled there to visit him. His father's last words were not to tell him about the accident so that he could concentrate on preparing for the upcoming season. As a result, Cho did not attend the funeral and was only told about the accident after he returned to South Korea. When KT Sonicboom won the regular season title in 2011, he dedicated the win to his late parents.\nIn May 2012, Cho married his university girlfriend, flautist Yoon Sook-jeong. Yoon, a graduate of Seoul National University, is a former principal flautist of the Gyeongbuk Provincial Symphony Orchestra. The couple have a daughter (born in 2015)."

It was played by four participants, half from Europe and half from South America in double round robin format, and featured star players like Didi and Garrincha for Botafogo, Uruguayan Ramón Villaverde who reappeared after the 1953 edition, goalkeeper Antoni Ramallets, Estanislau Basora, and Brazilian Evaristo for Barcelona, goalkeeper Roberto Sosa, Héctor Núñez, and Guillermo Escalada for Nacional de Montevideo, and Marcelino Campanal for Sevilla. Also, future Real Madrid defender José Santamaría was in Nacional's squad.\nThis was the last edition of the championship with its original name and degree of importance. After the creation of the European Champions Cup, the efforts of European clubs were all to dispute the then fledgling Cup, emptying the Venezuelan tournament. Real Madrid, European champions in 1955–56, participated in the 1956 competition; but after retaining their European title in 1956–57, Real Madrid did not attend the 1957 edition of the Venezuelan tournament, which ended up being the last tournament in this original series. Other invited teams that did not contest the competition were Lazio, Atlético Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Fluminense.\nSpanish team Barcelona won the competition, achieving their first title, with Uruguayan forward Ramón Villaverde being the topscorer with 6 goals. Other editions would happen without regularity, named Trophy City of Caracas, from 1963, but without the same quality of the participants."

        "title": "Jim Williams (darts player)",
        "text": "Jim Williams (born 27 July 1984) is a Welsh professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events.\nCareer.\nWilliams first ever rose to prominence in October 2012 at the Winmau World Masters in Hull. There he beat four players in the preliminary rounds to reach the main stage, most notably defeating reigning Lakeside World Champion Christian Kist 3–2 in his final match. Once on stage, he beat established campaigners Jan Dekker 3–1 and Ross Montgomery 3–2 to reach the quarter-finals, before losing out to eventual champion Stephen Bunting by 3 sets to 1.\nIn February 2013, he came closest to winning his first BDO ranking title, beating Jan Dekker and Remco van Eijden to reach the Scottish Open final, before losing 5–4 to Wesley Harms. In April, he made it to the semi-finals of the German Open, beating Paul Jennings and Richie George, but lost to champion Geert De Vos. One week later, he defeated Glen Durrant, Tony Eccles and John Walton to reach the last 4 of the Polish Open, but was beaten by Jeffrey de Graaf. In the Autumn, he lost to Tony O'Shea in the semis of the Romanian Open, and a fourth semi-final placing in 2013 came at the Northern Ireland Open. Add to that three further quarter final results last year and it amounts to a seeding place at Williams' first Lakeside. Williams made his debut at Lakeside in 2014 as the sole Welsh representative in the men's competition, and hoped to emulate countrymen Leighton Rees, Richie Burnett and Mark Webster by becoming BDO World Champion, but lost in the first round to Dave Prins.\nIn 2015, on the tour, Williams had some successful tournament runs, including a Final at the German Masters, losing out 6–4 to Wesley Harms. A last-8 in his home Welsh Open before eventually losing out to eventual winner Glen Durrant 4–0. Then a semi-final at the Polish Open, losing out to eventual winner Darius Labanauskas. Another final at the England national after defeating World number one Glen Durrant and Berkshire's Jason Heaver in the semi-final, he eventually lost out 6–5 to Cambridgeshire's Dennis Harbour. Another Quarter-final at Belgian Open where he lost out 4–2 the eventual winner Jeffrey de Graaf. Then his first ranking event title came at the Antwerp Open where he beat Brian Dawson in the quarters Fabian Roosenbrand in the semi-final before defeating Sven Verndock 2–0 in sets to become the 2015 Antwerp Open Champion. Also in 2015, Williams became Welsh individuals champion defeating Wayne Warren 2–0 in sets in the final. He also collected his first Welsh cap in the six nations of darts, and has been called up to represent Wales at the World cup in Turkey. In October, he went on to reach the final of the English classic, defeating Darryl Fitton 5–4 in the semi-final before going on to lose 6–2 to good friend Glen Durrant in the final. He then went on to the World Masters in Hull, losing out in the last 32 3 sets to 1 to Darius Labanauskas. He then went on to the Turkish Open, completing the singles and pairs double, winning the pairs with fellow countryman Martin Phillips, and then going on to defeat Phillips in the singles final 6 legs to 5 to become the 2015 Turkish Open Champion.\nIn 2019, Williams attempted to secure a PDC tour card. After failing to get a tour card, which would have allowed Williams to compete within the Professional Darts Corporation, he told Dartsnews.com: \"I am definitely staying with the BDO. I will possibly do a few PDC Challenge Tours but I’m not sure to be honest.\"\n In 2020, he reached the BDO World Championship final, but lost to Wayne Warren 7 sets to 4. This turned out to be the last ever BDO World Championship final, as the organization went into liquidation later that year. After failing to secure a PDC tour card for both the 2020 and 2021 PDC Pro Tour, Williams finally earned a tour card for the 2022 season by winning the 2021 PDC Challenge Tour, which also earned him a place in both the 2021 Grand Slam of Darts, and the 2022 PDC World Darts Championship.\nPDC.\nSince 2021 he is playing on the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) circuit. He qualified for his first PDC World Championship after winning the UK Challenge Tour, where he was beaten by Joe Cullen in the last 64. In only his 6th attempt he won a Pro Tour Event in which he beat Ricky Evans in the final 8-6 to pick up £12,000. In the 2024 PDC World Championship, he knocked out Peter Wright, at the time the 4th seed, in the 2nd round.\nPerformance timeline.\nBDO\nPDC\nPDC European Tour"

        "title": "Le Mans 24 Hours (video game)",
        "text": "Le Mans 24 Hours is a video game released for the PlayStation, Game Boy Color, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and Microsoft Windows (in two versions of the latter, one developed by Eutechnyx, like with the PlayStation version and the second version being a port of the Melbourne House version ported by Torus Games). The Dreamcast version was ported and published by Sega in Japan on 15 March 2001, while the PlayStation 2 version was ported and published by the same company on 13 June. Based on the famous 24 hours of Le Mans race in France, the player is invited to race the entire 24-hour endurance course or take part in a simpler arcade mode. The game also featured tracks such as Bugatti Circuit, Brno Circuit, Road Atlanta, Suzuka Circuit, Donington Park and Circuit de Catalunya, as well as a weather and night system.\nReception.\nThe Dreamcast version received \"universal acclaim\", and the PlayStation 2 version received \"generally favourable reviews\", while the PC version of \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" received \"mixed\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Chris Charla of \"NextGen\" said of the Dreamcast version in its January 2001 issue, \"It's no hardcore sim, but it may be the best reproduction of the actual feel of marathon racing ever.\" Ten issues later, however, Gary Whitta said of the PlayStation 2 version, \"While \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" has the chops to keep circuit-based racing fans satisfied for more than a few laps, it's nothing new.\"\nCheat Monkey of \"GamePro\" said of the PlayStation version, \"You've seen better from the \"Test Drive\" series, but hardcore racing fans might want to give \"Le Mans\" a try--that is when they've totally played out their copies of \"Gran Turismo\" or \"Need for Speed\".\" Four-Eyed Dragon later said of the PlayStation 2 version, \"The visuals and sound are the major sore spots of Le Mans. The graphics are grainy and not very sharp, especially when you're driving at night or in the rain. The soundtrack consists of poor crowd noises and out-of-tune music. Sadly, even the solid controls can't save Le Mans from straying off course.\"\nRobert Howarth of \"GameFan\" gave the PC version of \"Test Drive Le Mans\" 85%, saying that it \"offers above-average graphics, great controls and good artificial intelligence, as well as realistic tracks and cars all based on the 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race. Though its visuals are marred with some minor texture rendering problems on some systems, overall, its fast speed and sharp controls make \"Test Drive: Le Mans\" a game worth picking up for any hard-core racing enthusiast.\" Lupos of \"GameZone\" gave the same PC version six out of ten, saying, \"I think if you are an avid fan of \"Le Mans\", you will enjoy this game. It's not terrible. It's stable. You could \"probably\" get the steering wheel to work after a couple emails to Infogrames. You will enjoy doing the 24 hour challenges, racing against authentic teams and drivers, driving the authentic cars, and figuring out the handling on them. But if you just want to play a racing game that has the best physics engine, best graphics, and supports multiplayer, this isn't it.\" Later, Rita Courtney gave the Dreamcast version seven out of ten, saying, \"This isn't a game that you will get tired of in a hurry! I think the instruction booklet could have had a few more details, but other than that it's a great game and a lot of fun!\" Kevin Krause gave the PlayStation 2 version 7.8 out of 10, saying, \"Overall, \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" is entertaining and possibly worth purchasing if you're looking for something a little different than most racing titles. Don't think that it comes without flaw though because it doesn't - it could definitely use some refinement in a few areas.\" Later, Ovaldog gave the PC version of \"Le Mans 24 Hours\" 7.5 out of 10, calling it \"a very solid performer that should provide the race fan [with] many hours of racing action.\"\nNick Woods of \"AllGame\" gave the PC version of \"Test Drive Le Mans\" four stars out of five, saying, \"When all is said and done, \"Test Drive Le Mans\" is still a very fun, detailed game that will live up to the standards of racing game fans and critics alike.\" He later gave the Game Boy Color version three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \"Taking the good and the bad into account, \"Test Drive Le Mans\" ends up being a worthwhile purchase. Game Boy Color owners probably won't find a more gripping racing game for their format.\" Bryan Melville, however, gave the PlayStation version two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it \"another sub par game in the series.\"\n\"X-Play\" gave the Dreamcast version all five stars, saying, \"In all, \"Test Drive Le Mans\" is the best racing game on the platform, and one of the best of the genre. The low price only helps to make it a must-buy, and there's more than enough game to satisfy any racing fan's hunger. So put on a fresh pot of coffee, get comfortable, and prepare to spend the most time you ever have in a single race.\" \"Edge\" gave the same console version a score of seven out of ten, saying, \"an exceptional multiplayer option [...] combined with a massively satisfying singular experience go a long way to remedy the curtailing price of the official license.\"\nThe Dreamcast version won the award for \"Best Driving Game\" at \"GameSpot\"s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, and was nominated in the \"Best Game No One Played\" category. The staff argued that the game was \"a victim of the \"Test Drive\" name, as the \"Test Drive\" series is well known for producing large quantities of mediocre driving games—gamers just assumed \"Le Mans\" was more of the same.\"\nThe PlayStation 2 version was nominated at \"The Electric Playground\"s 2001 Blister Awards for \"Best Console Driving Game\", but lost to \"Grand Theft Auto III\"."

He played quarterback at Huntingdon from 1964 to 1966, winning All-State honors his senior year.\nCollege.\nPriest joined Tennessee's football team, at the time coached by Doug Dickey, in 1967, though freshmen were ineligible to play varsity before the 1970s. During spring practice prior to his sophomore year in 1968, Priest beat out two veterans for a starting slot in the defensive backfield. In Tennessee's game against Vanderbilt in November of that year, Priest intercepted a pass at the Tennessee 27 yard line late in the fourth quarter to thwart a Commodore drive and secure a 10–7 victory. He was named to the Sophomore All-SEC team at the end of the season.\nAs a member of the stellar 1969 defensive unit that included Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds, Steve Kiner, and Jackie Walker, Priest registered an SEC-leading seven interceptions. In Tennessee's 29–14 win over South Carolina, Priest intercepted a pass from quarterback Randy Yoakum in the fourth quarter to set up the Vols' final touchdown to help seal the win. In Tennessee's 45–19 win over Auburn, he intercepted a pass from Auburn quarterback Rick Eisenacher and returned it 38 yards for a touchdown.\nPrior to the 1970 season, Priest was elected team captain. Tennessee's new head coach, Bill Battle, hired two talented assistants, Larry Jones and Buddy Bennett, who encouraged a more aggressive style of play. Tennessee's 1970 defense registered an SEC-record 36 team interceptions. Tennessee safety Bobby Majors and Priest were first and second in the NCAA in interceptions that year, with ten and nine, respectively. During the third quarter of the Vols' 17–6 win over Georgia Tech, Priest intercepted a pass from Eddie McAshan at the Tennessee one yard line to snuff out a long drive. In Tennessee's 24–0 win over Alabama, Priest intercepted a pass from Tide quarterback Neb Hayden to set up the Vols' first touchdown, and finished the game with a school record three interceptions (part of a school team record eight interceptions). In Tennessee's 45–0 rout of Kentucky, Priest intercepted a pass from Bernie Scruggs to again set up the Vols' first score. He finished the season with 57 tackles (33 solo), including two sacks, to go along with his nine interceptions, and was named All-SEC.\nDuring his three years at Tennessee, Priest intercepted 18 passes, which remains a school record. His tally of nine interceptions in 1970 is tied for the school's second-highest single-season total (behind Majors' ten), and his three interceptions against Alabama in 1970 remains tied for the school's single-game record. Priest's career tally of 305 interception return yards remained tied with teammate Mike Jones for the school record until 2008, when it was broken by Eric Berry.\nPost-playing career.\nA three-time Academic All-SEC athlete, Priest was awarded an NCAA post-graduate scholarship following his senior year, and served as a graduate assistant for the Vols during the 1971 season. In 1972, Battle appointed Priest assistant coach of the freshman team, replacing Dewey Warren.\nPriest graduated valedictorian, Order of the Coif, from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1975, and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1976. He worked as an associate with the firm of Banks Campbell and Owen before becoming a full partner in 1978. He joined the firm of Pryor Priest and Harber in 1982. In 1998, he was appointed municipal court judge for the Town of Farragut, replacing the outgoing Judge David Creekmore. He held this position until 2005.\nFrom 1975 to 1999, Priest cohosted a radio call-in show, \"Football Finals,\" on the Knoxville-area radio station WIVK-FM. During the latter year, at the conclusion of Tennessee's national championship season, the long-time Vol Radio Network duo of play-by-play announcer John Ward and football color analyst Bill Anderson retired, and sports reporter Bob Kesling and Priest were hired as their respective successors. He announced his retirement from the Vol Network in June 2021, after 22 seasons.\nPriest was named to the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame in 2008, and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. On November 12, 2016, he was honored as a Vol Legend of the Game prior to Tennessee's game against Kentucky at Neyland Stadium.\nPersonal.\nPriest married former Vol cheerleader Betsy Minnis in 1971. They have two children, Adam and Laura."

The team is named after the House of Welf.\nHistory.\nPost SV Braunschweig.\nThe history of the club's rugby section goes back to 27 January 1954. On that date, the rugby section of \"Post SV Braunschweig\", a large multi-sports club, was founded. The club played mostly in regional lower-tier competitions, but in 1991 won their first (and only) promotion into the Rugby-Bundesliga, but suffered relegation again after just one season at the top-level.\nWelfen SC Braunschweig.\nIn the late 1990s, Post SV Braunschweig ran into financial problems, which eventually led to the club's dissolution in 2001. Due to this, the rugby section separated from the parent club and joined \"Welfen SC Heidberg\", another local sports club, in 1999. The club, based in the Heidberg district of Braunschweig and founded in 1973, later changed its name into \"Welfen SC Braunschweig\".\nAfter several seasons in the Rugby-Regionalliga, Welfen SC won promotion back to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga in 2011. In the 2014–15 season the club finished second in the north-east Liga-Pokal group and was knocked out by TuS 95 Düsseldorf in the quarter-finals of the play-offs.\nTuRa Braunschweig.\nIn 2014 the rugby players of Welfen SC decided to leave the club again due to being dissatisfied with the condition of the club's grounds. On 1 January 2015 they joined \"Turn- und Rasensportverein Braunschweig\" (short: TuRa Braunschweig), but continue to compete under the name Rugby-Welfen Braunschweig. TuRa Braunschweig had been founded as the city's second gymnastics club (after MTV Braunschweig) in 1865. The club's athletes have also won several German championships in other sports such as acrobatic gymnastics and Steinstossen.\nRecent seasons.\nRecent seasons of the club:"

The Serbian-born Singaporean, a former cager who played college basketball in the U.S as well as professionally in Europe, envisioned a local basketball league which provided opportunities for personal growth and development of youth athletes while also reinforcing positive influences, self-confidence, self-esteem and the ability to excel on and off the court.\nThe formation of a new Pro-Am league was announced on 22 December 2013. In order to fulfill this, Sportfolio Group LLP was incorporated by Vasiljev for the purpose of managing the new league. \nThe league tipped off officially on 12 January 2013, kick-starting a five-month competition that saw 132 games played between the 12 founding teams across multiple venues around Singapore. The inaugural season was seen by over 24,000 fans and featured 285 players from 26 countries, and was covered by most of the local media (Channel News Asia, The Straits Times, The New Paper, Today, 93.8 Live Radio and Liahne Zabao).\nTeams.\nThe Pro-Am SBL originated with 12 teams in 2013 with the initial founding teams spread across Singapore. The teams included players from all communities, including expats and import guest players.\nThe inaugural season was a great success, and besides receiving recognition by the FIBA and the regional basketball fraternity, the league has clearly differentiated from any other recreational or minor-league basketball organization in Singapore.

        "text": "William George Lee (November 2, 1873 – February 10, 1927) was an American college football player and medical doctor. He played for the Harvard Crimson football team while attending Harvard Medical School and was a consensus selection at the guard position on the 1901 College Football All-America Team.\nLee began his college education at Northwestern University. He transferred to Harvard College in 1899. During the fall of 1899, he was ineligible to play for the Harvard Crimson football team, but he did play for the \"scrub\" team in 1900 and, based on his play with the scrubs, was \"acknowledged one of the best guards Harvard has had for years.\"\nIn 1901, Lee, at age 28, became eligible for the football team. He played at the left guard position for the 1901 Harvard Crimson football team that compiled an undefeated 12–0 record and outscored its opponents 205 to 44. After Harvard defeated rival Yale, 22–0, the \"Boston Daily Globe\" praised Lee's work:\"[T]here is no lad in that Harvard eleven to whom I would sooner take off my hat to than to George Lee. His is the spirit which wins in the long run, and by the way, Harvard won yesterday simply because they had 10 men with the same spirit that animated Lee.\"\nEight of the eleven starters on the 1901 Harvard team, including Lee, were selected as consensus first-team selections for the 1901 College Football All-America Team. After the 1901 season, Lee was determined to be ineligible for the 1902 season under \"the four-year rule\", limiting a student-athlete to no more than four years of college football.\nLee graduated cum laude with an M.D. degree from Harvard in 1904. He returned to Chicago where he established a medical practice. He died there in 1927 at the age of 53."

        "title": "Poland at the UEFA European Championship",
        "text": "Poland have participated in four UEFA European Championships so far, all consecutively: Euro 2008, Euro 2012, Euro 2016 and Euro 2020, with an upcoming fifth appearance at Euro 2024.\nWhile the UEFA European Championship was first established in 1960, it took Poland as many as 48 years to qualify, by which time they had managed to attend five FIFA World Cup finals and win third place in two of them. By the end of the Cold War, Poland were the second most populated UEFA member state to have yet to compete in a Euro tournament (the most populated being Turkey), behind quite a few of their smaller neighbors, such as Czechoslovakia. Even some of the best coaches to ever run the Poland team, namely Kazimierz Górski and Antoni Piechniczek proved unable to break the humiliating succession of defeats. In 1996, Turkey and newly independent Russia made their Euro debuts, making Poland and newly independent Ukraine the only major UEFA member states to not have qualified for a European tournament (with Poland eventually beating Ukraine to making their debut first). Overall, Poland missed twelve European tournaments before qualifying for one for a first time.\nThe long-awaited qualification finally came in 2008 although Poland proved disappointing, ending last in the group stage, a scenario which would be repeated four years later, though drawing against Greece, Russia and the Czech Republic. The 2012 performance was especially criticized, with many suggesting that Poland would not have even qualified for the tournament had it not been one of the hosts. The next tournament, Euro 2016, proved historic as Poland got their first win in a European Championship with a 1–0 win over Northern Ireland and eventually made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Portugal on penalties and securing the best result for the Poland team since their well-remembered third place at the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nEuro 2008.\nPoland's qualification to the UEFA Euro 2008 marked their first appearance in the tournament. Despite qualifying for the tournament with an impressing campaign, edging Portugal to first place in their qualifying group, the tournament would be a disappointing debut with one point from three matches.\nIn a rematch from the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Poland took on Germany in the first game. Although the Poles were far from dominated in the game and created many chances, the match ended with a victory for Germany with the final score being 2–0. Lukas Podolski the Polish-born German striker scored the two goals for Germany in the game. In the second game Poland would take on the co-hosts Austria in Vienna. Roger Guerreiro opened the scoring for Poland in the 30th minute. Austria equalized in stoppage time in the 93rd minute after a controversial penalty, which the Austrian striker Ivica Vastić converted making the final score 1–1. In any hopes of qualifying Poland would need a large victory in their last game against Croatia. However, Croatia went on to beat Poland 1–0 and eliminated them from the tournament.\nThe Polish Football Association did not hold the coach Leo Beenhakker responsible for the disappointing performance and allowed him to keep his job for the 2010 World Cup qualifying. While Poland ended up at the bottom of the group for a third time in the 2000s, the sentiment prevalent in the Polish media was that of bad luck rather than any real lack of skill and most of public opinion was in favour of Beenhakker leading the national team to South Africa. The qualification round that followed, however, proved so disastrous and humiliating that Beenhakker lost any support in the Football Association, the press, and his own team itself, after which was promptly sacked.\nEuro 2012.\nOn 18 April 2007 in Cardiff, Wales, Poland along with Ukraine were elected by the UEFA's executive committee to co-host the 2012 UEFA European Championship, which was the 14th edition of the tournament. Poland, automatically seeded in Group A, were drawn with Russia, Greece and the Czech Republic. While Poland's poor performance at the last World Cup qualification was not forgotten, many hoped that the omnipresent sense of national pride as well as the honour of playing at home would push the team, composed of some prominent Bundesliga players, such as Jakub Błaszczykowski, Robert Lewandowski and Łukasz Piszczek, to their limits. Consequently, the initial reception of the first two matches, which ended in a draw (against Greece and Russia respectively), was somewhat positive, leaving public opinion moderately optimistic about the result of the final game against the Czech Republic. All hopes were shattered though and the Czech Republic won 1–0, leaving Poland at the bottom of their group once again, this time, to make things even worse, on home soil.\nEuro 2016.\nPoland once again failed to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, even though the scale of their defeat was not even close to that from four years before. Under a new management of Adam Nawałka, the team managed to make it smoothly through the qualification to Euro 2016 in France, their third European tournament ever. The team advanced to the knockout phase from the second place (behind Germany), after which it knocked out Switzerland on penalties, only to be given the taste of the very same treatment in the following quarterfinal game against Portugal.\nNawałka adapted an extremely defensive tactic, all but eliminating one of the major Polish flaws at previous tournaments: the tendency to lose goals as a result of small mistakes. During the whole tournament, Poland conceded as few as two goals, both of which were considered highly sophisticated and difficult to block. Compared with the defense, however, the offensive left much to be desired, with Robert Lewandowski scoring his only solitary goal in the last game and, together with Arkadiusz Milik, notoriously missing out on perfect scoring opportunities. Nevertheless, the tournament was viewed as successful in Poland and Nawałka was invited to lead the team in the qualification to the 2018 World Cup.\nEuro 2020.\nPoland managed to qualify for the UEFA Euro 2020 but not without skepticism after some of Poland's poor performance in qualifiers. However, Poland was unfortunate to be drawn with two very strong opponents, Spain and Sweden – both will be the first time Poland encounter against in the Euro. The last opponent was Slovakia who won the Euro qualifiers play-offs over Northern Ireland.\nThe tournament was a major catastrophe for the Polish side, as the team started its run with a shock 1–2 defeat to Slovakia, with Wojciech Szczęsny registered to the history in an unfabulous style as the first goalkeeper to score an own goal. Poland then fought back to gain a respectable 1–1 draw to Spain in Seville, all thanked for Robert Lewandowski, who then scored two goals in Poland's eventual 2–3 defeat to Sweden to end Poland's tournament in a disappointing last-place finish. All two losses of Poland occurred in Saint Petersburg."

Like all other equestrian events, the eventing competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division.\nFor the 1996 and 2000 Olympic competitions, the individual and team contests were separate events. A rider could compete in both competitions as long as it was on different horses. An example of this is the 2000 individual winner David O'Connor who won his gold medal riding \"Custom Made\", while he earned his team bronze medal with the U.S riding \"Giltedge\".\nResults.\nThe total score for each horse and rider was the sum of the total penalty points earned in the various phases of competitions. The pair with the lowest number of penalty points was victorious.\nDressage.\nFor the dressage portion of the competition, horse and rider pairs performed series of movements that were evaluated by judges. Judges gave marks of 0 to 10 for each movement, subtracting points for errors. The score for each judge was represented the total marks gained. For every point less than a total of 240, 0.2 Penalty Points were assessed.\nCross country.\nIn the cross country phase, each pair had to traverse 14.3 kilometers of road and track, 3.1 kilometers of steeplechase, and an obstacle course spread over a track of approximately 7.4 kilometers. Pairs received .4 penalty points for every second beyond the optimal time, up to a limit. Any pair that had not finished in that time was eliminated.\nPenalty points were also assessed for disobedience faults at obstacles and for falls. Disobedience faults incurred 20 penalty points, rider falls incurred 65, and horse falls eliminated the pair. The total penalty points from cross country were added to those incurred in phase 1, dressage, for a two-round total.\nShow jumping.\nIn show jumping, pairs received 4 penalty points for each obstacle knocked down, 4 penalty points for the horse's first disobedience, and 8 penalty points for the rider's first fall. They also received 1 penalty point for each second over the optimum time.\nThey could be eliminated for a second disobedience, the rider's second fall, the horse's first fall, or taking more than twice the optimum time to finish the course.

The club was formed on 30 May 2002 by a group of supporters of Wimbledon Football Club, led by Kris Stewart, Marc Jones and Trevor Williams who strongly opposed the decision of an independent commission appointed by the FA to allow the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes, who were subsequently reformed as Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.\nAFC Wimbledon was accepted into the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League for the 2002–03 season. The club's average home attendance at league fixtures for their first season exceeded 3,000 – higher than the average attendance in the same season of Wimbledon F.C., who were still playing in the First Division (now the EFL Championship). AFC Wimbledon have also broken the record for the longest run of unbeaten league games at any level of senior football in the United Kingdom. The club remained unbeaten for 78 league matches between 26 February 2003 (a 3–1 away win at Chessington United) and 27 November 2004 (a 2–1 away win at Bashley).\nThe club went on to achieve 5 promotions in 9 years, ensuring that they were the first club to be formed in the 21st century to make it into the Football League and making them the youngest of the 72 Football League clubs by some distance. On 30 May 2016, AFC Wimbledon achieved their 6th promotion to Football League One after victory in the 2016 Football League Two play-off final, exactly 14 years to the day since the club's formation.\nTo date, AFC Wimbledon has played more than 800 league fixtures against 168 opponents, maintaining an unbeaten winning record against 42 of them. AFC Wimbledon have faced Oxford United more than any other team in league fixtures, with 22 matches between the sides to date."

The Bulldogs represent Mississippi State University in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nMississippi State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1908. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983-84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985-86 season, but Mississippi State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season."

The club has teams competing in three categories, including first division, U-18 and U-16, with 120 players registered. The club has also the particularity of being the first aborigin rugby union club in Latin America.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1993 following an initiative of Eduardo Rossi, who had the idea of teaching the rules of the game to Toba aborigins of Formosa Province. Rossi, a rugby player himself and an admirer of Hitler and Mussolini, had played for Stade Toulousain in the 1980s although he had to leave the club due to his racist ideas. Several years later and after changing his mind about ethnic groups when visiting a Holocaust museum in France with his teammates, Rossi decided to spread the practise of the sport among Toba people of Formosa Province, who lived in conditions of extreme poverty.\nHe arrived to Formosa with the objective of establishing a rugby team and teaching local aborigins the rules of the game. The boys recruited by Rossi were minery and agricultural workers that trained barefoot two days a week and learnt how to play. They also used a truck instead of a scrumming machine in the practises due to the lack of resources.\nOn March 30, 1993, Aborigen Rugby Club made its official debut v. local team Aguará. Two years later the club played a friendly match v the U-19 Rosario combined team. In 1996 Aborigen played more friendly games, some of them v Tierra del Fuego and Tucumán teams. In 1998 Aborigen made its international debut, touring on New Zealand where they played two matches against local teams (with one victory and the rest game lost).\nThe Aborigen Rugby Club became popular in 2004 with the documentary named \"La Quimera de los Héroes\" (translated to English as \"The Chimera of Heroes\"), directed by Daniel Rosenfeld and released in 2008. The film tells the life of Eduardo Rossi and the foundation of Fundación Aborigen and was awarded at Venice and Independent Film festival of Buenos Aires."

In addition to the winning players, teams give rings to coaches, trainers, scouts, executives, and other staff members. Teams often give rings to players who played for the team, but do not qualify to have their name engraved on the Stanley Cup. The most ever won by a single player was Henri Richard with 11 total championship rings.\nHistory.\nThe Stanley Cup ring was established in 1893, when the Montreal Hockey Club won the 1893 Stanley Cup championship. Since that championship, the rings weren't given again until the Ottawa Senators won the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals. There have been cases in which championship teams have not awarded rings to its players, such as the Montreal Hockey Club's second championship (which gave out watches) and the 1915 champions, the Vancouver Millionaires (which issued medallions).\nFor many years teams did not give any rings at all and players had to buy them for themselves. In the 1950s The Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup four times, but players were given silverware or bought a dinner instead of rings. Players were eventually given rings by the team more than fifty years later. In the 1960s the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup four times, but players were originally only given one ring with diamonds that were removed and enlarged for each subsequent win. In 1971 the Montreal Canadiens gave players television sets instead of rings. Since 1972, every winning team has awarded more Stanley Cup Rings than the number of names engraved on the Stanley Cup. In 2011 Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs gave out a record 504 Stanley Cup rings to anyone connected with the team.\nDesign.\nEach ring usually costs between $20,000 to $25,000.\nPlayers with most Stanley Cup rings.\nThis is a list of NHL players with Stanley Cup championship rings won as a player."

        "text": "Charles Annesley Romeyn (December 14, 1874 – January 31, 1950) was an American football player and United States Army officer. He played for the Army Black Knights football team and was selected as a consensus first-team fullback on the 1898 College Football All-America Team.\nEarly years.\nRomeyn was born in 1874 in Indian Territory, in what is now the state of Oklahoma. He was the son of Major Romeyn.\nWest Point.\nRomeyn attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. While at the academy, he played at the fullback position for the Army Black Knights football team and was a consensus first-team selection for the 1898 College Football All-America Team.\nShortly before the 1898 football season got underway, Romeyn was stripped of his captain's stripes due to an \"unmilitary order\" he gave to cadets under his command. He reportedly told cadets, \"Keep your faces to the front. Turn your eyes if you want to see things, but remain quiet and face front.\"\nMilitary career.\nRomeyn graduated from the Military Academy in 1899 and spent his entire career in the Army. He was initially commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 10th Cavalry in February 1899 and stationed at Bayamo, Cuba until December 1899. He next served at Fort McIntosh, Texas, until April 1901. He was promoted to first lieutenant in February 1901 and was next stationed in the Philippines at Samar until October 1901.\nRomeyn next served in Montana on detached service at the Tongue River Agency charged with \"quieting\" the Cheyenne Indians in January 1902 and then on guard duty there until November 1902. He next served at Fort Meade in South Dakota before returning to the Philippines from June 1903 to May 1905. In the Philippines, Romeyn was stationed at Camp Stotsenburg.\nIn August 1905, Romeyn was promoted to captain while stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia. He next served at Fort Riley, Kansas, where he was a member of the Army Cavalry Rifle Team, entering national competitions in 1905, 1906 and 1907. From October 1907 to November 1909, Romeyn was stationed at Fort Des Moines. He participated in the Army's November and December 1907 expedition to Thunder Butte, South Dakota, with the mission of \"quieting\" Ute Indians. He also served as coach of the Army Cavalry Rifle Team in 1909. From December 1909 to May 1912, Romeyn served his third tour in the Philippines. He participated in action against \"Moro bandits\" in 1911 in the Cagayan Valley.\nRomeyn returned to the United States in June 1912 and was assigned to Fort Bliss in Texas and then Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. At the later station, he was a student officer at the Army School of the Line and Army Staff College. He graduated from Army Staff College in May 1914. From May 1914 to August 1917, he was stationed at Fort Ethan Allen in Vermont. He was promoted to major of the cavalry in May 1917, adjutant-general in July 1917 and lieutenant-colonel in August 1917. From August 1917 to June 1918, he was stationed at Camp Devens, a temporary cantonment in Massachusetts for training soldiers during World War I, with the 302nd Infantry. In July 1918, he was promoted to colonel of the infantry and became a member of the Army General Staff in Washington, D.C.\nRomeyn retired from the military in December 1938 at age 64. He died at Walter Reed Army Hospital on January 31, 1950, at age 75, and was buried at West Point Cemetery."

        "text": "The 2015 US Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It was the 135th edition of the US Open, the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\nMarin Čilić was the defending champion in the men's singles event, but lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in the semifinals. Serena Williams was the three-time defending champion in the women's singles event and was also trying to complete the first calendar Grand Slam since Steffi Graf in 1988, having won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, but lost to Roberta Vinci in the semifinals. Flavia Pennetta won the women's singles title and became the first Italian to win the US Open. The finalists Vinci and Flavia Pennetta were childhood friends from Southern Italy and grew up together.\nTournament.\nThe 2015 US Open was the 135th edition of the tournament and it was held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States.\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2015 ATP World Tour and the 2015 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consists of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There are singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which is part of the Grade A category of tournaments, and singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.\nIn addition, the annual men's and women's Champions Invitational doubles events were held, with eight male and eight female former Grand Slam champions taking part. For the second year running, the American Collegiate Invitational competitions is organized, where top sixteen American collegiate players compete in men's and women's singles events. Exhibition matches also take place.\nThe tournament is played on hard courts and takes place over a series of 17 courts with DecoTurf surface, including the three main showcourts – Arthur Ashe Stadium (with permanent steel erected and new video boards, LED court lighting and sound system in place, as part of a refurbishment project), Louis Armstrong Stadium and Grandstand. It is the last ever US Open played on courts without the operational roof on center court and with the old Grandstand in place. Starting from the 2016 edition, the Arthur Ashe Stadium will have completed retractable roof and matches will be played on newly built Grandstand.\nAfter two years of tournament being scheduled across 15 days, the US Open returns to a traditional 14-day schedule in 2015, which has impact on all senior events. Women's singles semifinals have been scheduled for September 10 evening session, while men's singles semifinal matches will be played on Friday September 11 after mixed doubles final. Men's doubles final will be played before women's singles final on Saturday September 12, and men's singles final will follow women's doubles final.\nBecause Serena Williams could become the first woman to win all four major tennis titles in a calendar year since Steffi Graf accomplished the feat in 1988 and because she could tie Graf's major title count of 22, the women's final sold out before the men's final for the first time.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the 2015 US Open was the first under a new, 11-year, $825 million contract with ESPN, in which the broadcaster holds exclusive rights to the entire tournament and the US Open Series, thus ending CBS Sports' 46-year association with the tournament, and availability of coverage on broadcast television. This also made ESPN the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for three of the four tennis majors (the French Open is split between Tennis Channel for cable coverage and NBC for over-the-air coverage, with portions previously sub-licensed to ESPN until 2016).\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe US Open total prize money for 2015 was increased by 10.5 percent to a record $42,253,400, which potentially could reach almost 45 million dollars, as the top three finishers in the Emirates Airline US Open Series may earn up an additional $2.625 million in bonus money at the US Open.\nOf the total prize money, $33,017,800 (plus $1,760,000 in qualifying competitions) is distributed for singles players, $4,927,600 for teams competing in doubles events and $500,000 for mixed doubles teams. Competitors in Legends Exhibition, Wheelchair and Champions Invitational events earn $570,000 while players' per diem is estimated at $1,478,000.\nTop three players in the 2015 US Open Series receive bonus prize money, depending on where they finished in the 2015 US Open, according to money schedule below.\nSingles seeds.\nSeedings are based on rankings as of August 24, 2015. Rankings and points before are as of August 31, 2015.\nBecause the tournament takes place one week later than in 2014, points defending includes results from both the 2014 US Open and tournaments from the week of September 8, 2014 (Davis Cup for the men; Hong Kong, Québec, and Tashkent for the women).\nWild card entries.\nThe following players received wild cards into the main draw senior events.\nQualifier entries.\nThe qualifying competitions took place at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on August 25 – 28, 2015.\nProtected ranking.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main draw using a protected ranking:\nWithdrawals.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main tournament, but withdrew with injuries."

        "title": "Henry Wakefield (American football)",
        "text": "Henry Smith \"Hek\" Wakefield (February 10, 1899 – November 19, 1962) was an American college football player and coach. He played fullback and end for the Vanderbilt Commodores of Vanderbilt University from 1921 to 1924, receiving the honor of consensus All-American in his senior year. He was considered the greatest drop kicker in school history.\nEarly years.\nWakefield was born on February 10, 1899, in Petersburg, Tennessee, to Samuel S. T. Wakefield and Lula Dyer. Samuel, who owned a sawmill in Petersburg, reportedly died in 1917 as a result of burns caused by the explosion of a steam engine at his sawmill.\nPrep school.\nWakefield attended prep school at Fitzgerald &amp; Clarke School in Tullahoma, Tennessee, where he won a state football title on a team coached by Wallace Wade, who later coached Wakefield at Vanderbilt. All-American Vanderbilt end Lynn Bomar was a teammate at both Fitzgerald &amp; Clarke and Vanderbilt.\nVanderbilt University.\nFootball.\nWakefield played for coach Dan McGugin's Vanderbilt Commodores from 1921 to 1924. He was a prominent member of Commodores teams that compiled a win–loss–tie record of 26–5–4 () over his four seasons, and was an All-Southern selection in 1923 and 1924. The Commodores won three conference titles over this span, including their most recent one to date. He played fullback and end, as well as kicker for extra points and field goals.\n1921.\nWakefield starred in the Sewanee game to finish his freshman year. The Commodores closed the undefeated season winning 9 to 0 in what was called the \"muddiest game\" in its history. The Commodores were reportedly knee-deep in mud and water, with players unrecognizable. The touchdown for Vanderbilt came after Wakefield's punt of 54 yards was fumbled by Sewanee and recovered by Pos Elam. The subsequent drive resulted in a five-yard touchdown run by Wakefield. Wakefield kicked his own extra point.\n1922.\nWakefield was the starting fullback and kicker for the undefeated 1922 team. He was thus a starter for the scoreless tie with Michigan at the dedication of Vanderbilt's new Dudley Field. \"That's the only game in which I prayed\", said Wakefield, \"I was a sophomore at the time and when they put me in, I remember saying a little prayer that Michigan would run the other way.\" In the game against Texas at the Texas State Fair, which Vanderbilt won 20 to 10, the Commodores' first score came after Wakefield recovered a fumble by Texas's Franklin Stacy on a punt return, at the 25-yard line. Wakefield also blocked a Texas field goal attempt that day. He made an 18-yard field goal in a 9 to 0 victory over the Kentucky Wildcats. A trick play which resulted in a touchdown thrown from Doc Kuhn to Lynn Bomar against Sewanee was set up by a 33-yard punt return by Wakefield. Vanderbilt won 26 to 0, finishing the year as Southern Conference champions. Wakefield made seven extra points on the year.\n1923.\nDuring the 1923 season, in a close loss of 3 to 0 against that season's eventual national champion, Michigan, opposing coach Fielding Yost said of Wakefield, \"I never saw a greater exhibition of end play.\" \"The Kingsport Times\" reported that governor Austin Peay had praised Wakefield for his play that day. In the game against Tulane, Wakefield had to play quarterback. Vanderbilt was without its quarterback and captain, Doc Kuhn, as well as halfback Gil Reese. Reese had hurt his knee, and during the previous week's game against the Texas Longhorns, Kuhn was hit on the head and had yet to regain his mental composure. Vanderbilt won 17–0. Wakefield contributed a field goal to the 51–7 drubbing of the Tennessee Volunteers. Against the Georgia Bulldogs, the Commodores won 35–7. In the third quarter, Kuhn completed a 45-yard pass to Wakefield, caught at Georgia's four-yard line. From there, Vanderbilt scored with a line buck from Tom Ryan. Georgia athletic director and former coach Herman Stegeman rated Wakefield as the best player in all of the south. At year's end, Wakefield, along with Bomar, were selected as All-Southern ends. Vanderbilt and Washington &amp; Lee finished the season as co-champions of the Southern Conference. A poll of sportswriters selected the Commodores as the best team in the south, awarding them the Champ Pickens Trophy.\nJack Wakefield.\nIn a postseason contest played for the benefit of local charitable institutions, Vanderbilt played a cast of former Princeton varsity stars on December 8. Among the stars were Stan Keck, Frank Murrey, Hank Garrity, John P. Gorman, Ralph Gilroy, A. Barr Snively, and Herb Treat. It was the first showcase of Eastern football in Nashville in many years. The Commodores tied the team of ex-Tigers, 7–7. Both scoring plays occurred within five minutes of each other. Murrey mentored Wakefield in the art of drop-kicking.\nDuring the game, the one player on Vanderbilt's roster not from the 1923 varsity team was Hek's younger brother, Robert Allen \"Jack\" Wakefield. He was a highly renowned back on the freshman team, called \"the greatest player in Southern freshman football for the past season.\" By all accounts, he played an inspired game, \"he cut an all Princeton line into shreds of Black and Orange. He threw all America tackles aside as he would throw sacks of straw, and trampled great names into the turf.\" Twenty-five years later, Centre head coach Charley Moran called Jack \"the greatest football player I ever saw, barring nobody.\" It was the only game Jack ever played with a varsity team at Vanderbilt. He soon left to play professional baseball with the Saint Louis Cardinals, but twice broke his leg in preliminary work with the Cardinals, leaving him out for the season. On December 10, 1924, after a quarrel with his fiancee, Jack went to the house of a friend in Memphis and committed suicide with a pistol.\n1924.\nFred Russell's \"Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football\" dubs 1924 \"the most eventful season in the history of Vanderbilt football.\" Vanderbilt opened Wakefield's senior season in the rain on September 27, 1924, against Henderson-Brown at Dudley Field in Nashville, winning by a score of 13–0. Wakefield scored both touchdowns. The first came after captain and guard Tuck Kelly blocked a punt, the other on a pass into the end zone from quarterback Nig Waller. In the game with the Quantico Marines, Vanderbilt was stymied by a 13–13 tie. A newspaper account describes Vanderbilt's first score:\nIt was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up what looked like a Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose.\nTo open the second half, Waller fumbled the kickoff. The Marines recovered and were already near the goal. The Commodores' line held the Marines scoreless inside the 10-yard line on three separate occasions, mostly due to Wakefield, Bob Ledyard, and Jess Keene.\nAs an interim team captain following the loss of both Kelly and Bomar to injuries, Wakefield scored twice in the Commodores' 13–0 win over the Auburn Tigers, and defeated the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 3–0 with a 37-yard drop-kick field goal. He also played every minute of an inspired game against Minnesota, resulting in Vanderbilt's first win over a Northern school: \"Wakefield chose his plays with excellent judgement. His tackling forced the Gophers frequently to take time out, and he repeatedly threw Minnesota back for losses\", reported the \"Nashville Tennessean\". The final game with Sewanee saw the Tigers win for the first time in years, 16 to 0. In the first few minutes of play, Wakefield suffered a broken leg, yet played for ten more minutes before hobbling to the bench, joining Kelly and Bomar. Following his senior season, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, having received first-team honors from the International News Service (INS), the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and Billy Evans. Wakefield was selected a second-team All-American by Walter Camp of \"Collier's Weekly\", who said, \"The south has been entirely overlooked this year on the first eleven. It is a well known fact that the experts in that section were positive Wakefield of Vanderbilt would draw one of the ends.\" Billy Evans, who selected Wakefield first-team All America, claimed that \"Wakefield is one of the best ends I have seen in years. Southern experts rate him the greatest end the south has ever produced.\"\nTrack.\nWakefield was also a member of Vanderbilt's track team.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from Vanderbilt, Wakefield became an assistant coach under McGugin from 1925 to 1928. He coached the ends. Larry Creson was cited as an example of a Wakefield protégé.\nPost-coaching career and death.\nWakefield went into banking in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1929. On June 17, 1929, he was shot twice, but survived. In 1936, coach McGugin died, and Wakefield was a pall bearer. The same year, Wakefield suffered a broken jaw in a car crash.\nDeath.\nIn 1962, Wakefield was found dead, lying in the doorway of his motel room near his parked car which had apparently been involved in a crash. The car was badly damaged; the seat stained with blood. The investigator said Wakefield had likely crashed into a utility pole and managed to drive back to his motel before collapsing."

        "text": "Don Vaughan is a Canadian ice hockey retired coach and player. Vaughan had been the head coach at Colgate from 1992 through 2023 and is the programs leader in wins, losses, ties and tenure.\nCareer.\nVaughan began his college career at Canton College, playing for the hockey team for one season before transferring to the cross-town St. Lawrence University, a private university. More importantly Vaughan was now playing for a Division I program. Under Mike McShane Vaughan put up respectable numbers in his three seasons as the Saints posted winning records each year and made the 1983 NCAA Tournament, falling to eventual champion Wisconsin in the quarterfinals.\nAfter graduating with a degree in economics Vaughan headed to Europe to serve as the player-coach for the Enschede Lions, an ice hockey club in the Netherlands.\nIn 1991 long-time Colgate coach Terry Slater died suddenly and, after the season was finished under Brian Durocher, Vaughan was picked to replace him. The initial seasons were a bit lacking but Vaughan built the program back to its winning ways soon enough, giving the Colgate faithful a 20-win season in 1994–95 which started them on to six consecutive winning seasons culminating with their first NCAA tournament berth in a decade. The season finished with Vaughan being awarded the 2000 ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year Award.\nIn 2003 Vaughan agreed to serve out the season as Colgate's interim athletic director, allowing long-time assistant Stan Moore to assume control of the team for the year. The Raiders performed exceptionally in his absence, winning a regular season title and earning Moore his own Coach of the Year Award. Not to be outdone, when Vaughen returned the following season he pushed Colgate to a 25-win season (the second-highest total in school history), earning him a second tournament berth which he followed up by winning his first regular season title.\nAfter that the team began to flounder, failing to produce a winning season until 2011–12, but it wasn't all bad news for Vaughan as Colgate established an endowed hockey chair named in his honor. After winning his first conference championship in 2023, Vaughan retired after 30 years as the Raiders' head coach. He left as the program's all time leader in games, wins, losses and ties.\nHead coaching record.\nSource:"

The team is not a member of the International Cricket Council, but the Dominica Cricket Association is a member of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from Dominica generally represent the Windward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. Dominica has however played as a separate entity in matches which held Twenty20 status, but has not appeared in first-class or List A cricket. The team's captain, as of December 2013, is Liam Sebastien.\nHistory.\nA Dominica cricket team first appeared in West Indian cricket in the 1912/13 Hesketh Bell Shield against Saint Kitts at the Antigua Recreation Ground. The team is next recorded playing twelve years later in the 1925/26 Hesketh Bell Shield, with Dominica playing in the Shield until 1932, later playing in the Cork Windward Islands Challenge Cup in 1938 and 1939. In 1930, Merril Anthony became the first recorded person to have played for Dominica to play first-class cricket when he appeared for British Guiana. There is a long gap between 1939 and Dominica's next recorded appearance, which came in the 1965 Windward Islands Tournament against Saint Kitts. By this time the Windward Islands were playing matches which held first-class status, with Windsor Park playing host to the team's fourth first-class fixture in 1965 against the Leeward Islands. Dominica continued to play in the Windward Islands Tournament, and from 1975 its successor, the Heineken Trophy. Their participation in the tournament (under various names) continued into the 1990s, with matches home throughout this period being held mostly at the Windsor Park.\nHaving played in regional tournaments throughout the early to mid 2000s, Dominica were invited to take part in the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. They played one match in the tournament, a 6 wicket defeat to Grenada. Two years later, they were invited to take part in the 2008 Stanford 20/20, playing two matches in the tournament, defeating the British Virgin Islands in the preliminary round, before losing to Barbados in the following round. These matches mark Dominica's only major appearances in cricket.\nNotable players.\nInternational players.\nFive players from Dominica have represented the West Indies Internationally.\nMany other Dominican players have represented the Windward Islands domestically in the West Indies Regional Super50, Regional Four Day Competition and the Caribbean Twenty20.\nSee also.\nList of Windward Islands first-class cricketers"

A tender farewell to father and blind sister, Bertha, takes him to the road where he bids adieu to his sweetheart, Mary Fielding. There is then a lapse of three years and we find honest John Pereyhingle the husband of Dot. Mrs. Fielding has gotten into moderate straits and consents to the marriage of Old Tackleton, the grouch, to May. This is repugnant to May, whose heart is set on Edward. Edward returns, stopping on the way at the King George Inn where he learns of the approaching nuptials of Tackleton and May. Borrowing a disguise from a strolling Merry Andrew, he goes in the garb of an old wayfarer on John’s cart to see Dot and find out the truth. John, prompted by Tackleton, watches the pair. Not recognising Edward, John assumes he is a lover. Edward upon learning from Dot how inimical the match is to May resolves to carry her away, which he does with the assistance of Dot. They are married in the roadway just as the much perturbed Tackleton appears. John discovers what a fool he has been in doubting Dot, Tackleton realises what an unpopular grouch he has been and decides to change, while Bertha and Old Caleb are overjoyed at the return of Edward."

The maximum number of cyclists per nation was four. It was held on 23 October 1968. The course, just short of 25 kilometres, was covered 8 times for a total distance of 196.2 kilometres. The event was won by Pierfranco Vianelli of Italy, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's individual road race (putting Italy over France in most gold medals, three to two). It was the fourth consecutive Games that an Italian cyclist finished first or second. Leif Mortensen's silver was Denmark's second consecutive silver medal in the event. Gösta Pettersson earned Sweden's first medal in the event with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). There \"was no heavy favorite as the last three World Championships had seen nine different riders on the podium.\"\nBarbados, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Lebanon, and Madagascar each made their debut in the men's individual road race; West Germany competed separately for the first time. Great Britain made its eighth appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a course that covered eight laps of a 24.525 kilometres circuit, for a total of 196.2 kilometres. It was a \"quite hilly\" course."

        "title": "Infant swimming",
        "text": "Infant swimming is the phenomenon of human babies and toddlers reflexively moving themselves through water and changing their rate of respiration and heart rate in response to being submerged. The slowing of heart rate and breathing is called the bradycardic response. It is not true that babies are born with the ability to swim, though they have primitive reflexes that make it look like they are. Newborns are not old enough to hold their breath intentionally or strong enough to keep their head above water, and cannot swim unassisted.\nMost infants, though not all, will reflexively hold their breath when submerged to protect their airway and are able to survive immersion in water for short periods of time. Infants can also be taken to swimming lessons. Although this may be done to reduce their risk of drowning, the effects on drowning risk are not reliable.\nBabies can imitate swimming motions and reflexes, but are not yet physically capable of swimming.\nA submersion of the head may last only a few seconds. A German physician pointed out the health risks of infant diving and the sometimes serious consequences as early as 1986, writing that since the introduction of baby swimming in Germany, several hundred infants had died from brain complications as a result of sinusitis and otitis that occurred after diving. Pediatricians also reported cases of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure.\nInfant swimming or diving reflex.\nMost human babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from birth until the age of approximately six months, which are part of a wider range of primitive reflexes found in infants and babies, but not children, adolescents and adults. Other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex). This reflex involves apnea (loss of drive to breathe), slowed heart rate (reflex bradycardia), and reduced blood circulation to the extremities such as fingers and toes (peripheral vasoconstriction). During the diving reflex, the infant's heart rate decreases by an average of 20%. The glottis is spontaneously sealed off and the water entering the upper respiratory tract is diverted down the esophagus into the stomach.\nThe diving response has been shown to have an oxygen-conserving effect, both during movement and at rest. Oxygen is saved for the heart and the brain, slowing the onset of serious hypoxic damage. The diving response can therefore be regarded as an important defence mechanism for the body.\nDrowning risk.\nDrowning is a leading cause of unintentional injury and death worldwide, and the highest rates are among children. Overall, drowning is the most common fatal injury among children aged 1–4 years in the USA, and is the second highest cause of death altogether in that age range, after congenital defects.\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2012 of United States data from 2005–2009 indicated that each year an average of 513 children aged 0–4 years were victims of fatal drowning and a further 3,057 of that age range were treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments for non-fatal drowning. Of all the age groups, children aged 0–4 years had the highest death rate and also non-fatal injury rate. In 2013, among children 1 to 4 years old who died from an unintentional injury, almost 30% died from drowning. These children most commonly drowned in swimming pools, often at their own homes.\nSwimming lessons for infants.\nTraditionally, swimming lessons started at age four years or later, as children under four were not considered developmentally ready. However, swimming lessons for infants have become more common. The Australian Swimming Coaches and Teachers Association recommends that infants can start a formal program of swimming lessons at four months of age and many accredited swimming schools offer classes for very young children, especially towards the beginning of the swimming season in October. In the US, the YMCA and American Red Cross offer swim classes. A baby has to be able to hold his or her head up (usually at 3 to 4 months), to be ready for swimming lessons.\nChildren can be taught, through a series of \"prompts and procedures,\" to float on their backs to breathe, and then to flip over and swim toward a wall or other safe area. Children are essentially taught to swim, flip over and float, then flip over and swim again. Thus, the method is called \"swim, float, swim.\"\nPros and cons of infant swimming lessons.\nIn a 2009 retrospective case-control study that involved significant potential sources of bias, participation in formal swimming lessons was associated with an 88% reduction in the risk of drowning in 1- to 4-year-old children, although the authors of the study found the conclusion imprecise. Another study showed that infant swimming lessons may improve motor skills, but the number of study subjects was too low to be conclusive.\nThere may be a link between infant swimming and rhinovirus-induced wheezing illnesses.\nOthers have indicated concerns that the lessons might be traumatic, that the parents will have a false sense of security and not supervise young children adequately around pools, or that the infant could experience hypothermia, suffer from water intoxication after swallowing water, or develop gastrointestinal or skin infections.\nProfessional positions.\nIn 2010, the American Academy of Pediatrics reversed its previous position in which it had disapproved of lessons before age 4, indicating that the evidence no longer supported an advisory against early swimming lessons. However, the AAP stated that it found the evidence at that time insufficient to support a recommendation that all 1- to 4-year-old children receive swimming lessons. The AAP further stated that in spite of the popularity of swimming lessons for infants under 12 months of age and anecdotal evidence of infants having saved themselves, no scientific study had clearly demonstrated the safety and efficacy of training programs for infants that young. The AAP indicated its position that the possible benefit of early swimming instruction must be weighed against the potential risks (e.g., hypothermia, hyponatremia, infectious illness, and lung damage from pool chemicals).\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends swimming lessons for children from 1–4, along with other precautionary measures to prevent drowning.\nThe Canadian Pediatric Society takes a middle-of-the-road approach. While it does not advise against swimming lessons for infants and toddlers, it advises that they can not be considered a reliable prevention for drowning, and that lessons for children less than 4 years should focus on building confidence in the water and teaching parents and children water safety skills. They also recommend, for all children less than 4 years, constant arms-length supervision for toddlers near any body of water (including bathtubs) and that infants be held at all times."

        "text": "Carlos Luis Rivero Milán (born May 20, 1988) is a Venezuelan professional baseball third baseman who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows.\nRivero was originally signed by the Cleveland Indians as an international free agent in 2005, and played for them for five minor league seasons (2006–2010) before joining the Philadelphia Phillies (2011) and Washington Nationals (2012–2013) organizations. He initially began as a strong-armed shortstop before being moved to third base, and has also spent time in left field. The Red Sox signed him in December 2013.\nIn between, Rivero played winter baseball for the Leones del Caracas, Bravos de Margarita and Cardenales de Lara clubs of the LVBP.\nCareer.\nCleveland Indians.\nThe Venezuelan infielder ranked among the 20-top Cleveland prospects from 2007 through 2009. He also was rated twice by \"Baseball America\" as having the best infield arm in the Indians organization in the 2008 and 2009 seasons, before being named the best defensive third baseman in the International League in 2012 while playing for Washington affiliate the Syracuse Chiefs.\nRivero earned International League All-Star honors during the 2012 season when he played at Syracuse. Previously, he was named the 2007 South Atlantic League Mid-Season All-Star while playing for the Lake County Captains, also a Cleveland affiliate.\nBoston Red Sox.\nNot long after signing him, the Red Sox assigned Rivero to Double A Portland Sea Dogs to start the 2014 season. He then gained a promotion to Triple A Pawtucket Red Sox during the midseason. He struggled after being called up to Triple-A, batting just .179 through eight games in the month of May. But Rivero improved the rest of the way, hitting .319 to go along with a .375 on-base percentage in June. He finished the month with a solid week, recording at least a hit in all seven games to be named the International League Batter of the Week. He went 12-for-28 (.429) during the seven-game span, raising his season average to .286. In addition, Rivero drove in five runs and scored six times, while compiling three extra-base hits, as his efforts helped Pawtucket conclude a 5-2 stretch. He often filled the designated hitter role when he was not playing on the field. Overall, he hit .262/.320/.379 with five homers and 36 RBI in 74 games for Pawtucket before joining the Boston Red Sox.\nMajor Leagues.\nAfter nine seasons in professional baseball, Rivero became a major leaguer when the Red Sox purchased his contract from Pawtucket on August 25, 2014 after placing shortstop Xander Bogaerts on the seven-day concussion disabled list. He made his major league debut on August 29, pinch hitting for Will Middlebrooks. He was walked in his only plate appearance.\nSeattle Mariners.\nRivero was claimed off waivers by the Seattle Mariners on November 3, 2014 but on December 2, 2014 he was non-tendered and became a free agent. However, they soon re-signed him to a minor league contract.\nSecond stint with Boston Red Sox.\nOn August 9, 2015, Rivero was traded back to the Boston Red Sox for cash and assigned to Triple-A Pawtucket.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn November 18, 2015, Rivero signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was assigned to Triple-A. Rivero signed a new minor league contract with the Diamondbacks on January 24, 2017. He was released on June 19, 2017.\nTokyo Yakult Swallows.\nOn July 6, 2017, Rivero signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn March 20, 2018, Rivero signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League. He became a free agent following the season. \nBravos de León.\nRivero signed with the Bravos de León for the 2019 season. \nAlgodoneros de Unión Laguna.\nOn February 16, 2020, Rivero was traded to the Algodoneros de Unión Laguna. Rivero did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the LMB season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Rivero batted .278/.338/.456 with 11 home runs and 53 RBIs in 65 games. He became a free agent following the season. \nBravos de León (second stint).\nOn January 13, 2022, Rivero re-signed with the Bravos de León for the 2022 season. \nRieleros de Aguascalientes.\nOn July 14, 2022, he was traded to the Rieleros de Aguascalientes in exchange for P Hayato Takagi. \nOn December 12, 2022, Rivero was traded to the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos in exchange for Wilfredo Tovar. However, he did not appear in a game for the Tecolotes in 2023.\nOn January 16, 2024, Rivero was loaned to the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican League. He was released by Quintana Roo on March 11.\nAccident.\nOn December 6, 2018, Rivero, Luis Valbuena, and José Castillo were in a car in Yaracuy driven by Rivero's chauffeur when the car struck a rock. The driver tried to avoid it, but crashed. Rivero and the driver survived, but Castillo and Valbuena were killed. Castillo, Rivero, and Valbuena were all members of Venezuelan winter team Cardenales de Lara, and had played a game the day of the accident."

        "text": "Gary Wright is an American retired ice hockey coach. Wright served as head coach of Rice Memorial High School from 1976 to 1979, an assistant coach at Maine from 1979 to 1984, and as the head coach of American International from 1984 through 2016. After the retirement of Jack Parker in 2012–13 Wright became the longest-tenured coach in the NCAA along with Red Berenson.\nCareer.\nGary Wright got his start in college hockey at Vermont after graduating from Proctor Academy in 1972. After his sophomore season the Catamounts made the move to Division I, giving Wright two valuable years of playing experience at the top level under Jim Cross. Wright's playing career ended upon his graduation in 1976 and he quickly moved into the coaching ranks, becoming the head coach for Rice Memorial in his hometown of Burlington. Wright got the team to a second-place finish in his second season but after the third he left to become an assistant for Maine.\nAt the time of his arrival, Maine had just jumped up to the D-I ranks, joining ECAC Hockey in 1979–80. The Black Bears managed just one winning season over the next five years under Jack Semler as they grew accustomed to the stiffer competition but, as Semler was being replaced by Shawn Walsh after 1983–84, Wright got the opportunity to become the head coach at American International. Wright took over in AIC's final season as a Division II as the level was dissolving, forcing the Yellow Jackets to drop down to Division III the following year. The program joined ECAC East that same year and began to build a respectable reputation that would carry them into the mid-1990s. Despite a sharp decline after 1994, AIC was willing to sign on to the NCAA-mandated Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference as an associate member in 1998–99.\nAfter a good first season in the MAAC, AIC remained at or near the bottom for the remainder of their time in the conference. When Atlantic Hockey formed in 2003–04 to take over from the discontinued MAAC the Yellow Jackets accompanied all of the former members into the new conference. The chance in name brought little difference in outcome for Wright's team. The Yellow Jackets were one of the worst programs in terms of wins in their conference and all of college hockey after joining the Division I ranks. Despite the lack of on-ice success, Wright was lauded for achieving a perfect Academic Progress Rate with his players and coaching AIC to three Team Sportsmanship Awards.\nWright coached AIC from 1984 to 2016. Although his 605 losses are an NCAA record for a coach at one school, Wright was respected at the university for keeping the program alive as it played much larger and better-funded Division I teams."

Riley coached the Sabres for two years before leaving to return to West Point, remaining as an assistant until his brother stepped down as head coach in 2004, making way for Brian to run the family business.\nSince taking control of the team Riley has led the Black Knights through a relatively stable period in the program's history, having remained in the same conference for at least his first ten seasons and even producing a conference regular season title in 2007–08 (Army's first)."

        "text": "Rob Thompson (born 29 August 1991) is a New Zealand rugby union player who currently plays centre for in New Zealand's domestic Mitre 10 Cup and the in the international Super Rugby competition.\nEarly career.\nOriginally hailing from Manawatu, Thompson started out his rugby career playing club rugby in his home province for University while working as a storeman. After failing to be picked in the Manawatu Turbos ITM Cup squad in 2012, he headed south to try out for Canterbury's Colts side. His development continued in 2013 when he was selected for the Crusaders Knights squad during the first half of the year and the Canterbury ITM Cup team in the latter part.\nSenior career.\nAlthough Thompson wasn't initially named in the squad for the 2013 ITM Cup, injuries and All Blacks call-ups meant that Thompson was promoted from the wider training group and went on to become a key player as the red and blacks were crowned ITM Cup Premiership champions. He made 10 appearances and scored 4 tries in his first year of provincial rugby and was subsequently promoted to Canterbury's full squad for 2014. The Cantabrians failed to defend their Premiership crown in 2014 but Thompson did feature in all 11 of their games during a season which culminated with elimination at the hands of local rivals, at the semi-final stage.\nBoth he and Canterbury were back on song in 2015 with Canterbury reclaiming their ITM Cup Premiership Title with a 25-23 victory over in the final and Thompson finishing as the tournament's joint leading try scorer along with George Moala of Auckland. His try haul of 10 included a hat-trick in Round 4, a 57-7 win over his home province, Manawatu. Canterbury made it back to back provincial titles in 2016 and 8 titles in 9 years with an MCL strain restricting Thompson to just 6 appearances in which he managed an impressive haul of 4 tries including one in the final, a 43-27 win over Tasman.\nSuper Rugby.\nThompson's form during the 2013 ITM Cup brought him to the attention of Christchurch-based Super Rugby franchise, the who named him as a member of their wider training group for the 2014 Super Rugby season during which he made a total of 2 appearances. \nHowever, the following year he found himself without a Super Rugby contract and had to rebuild his career in club rugby.\nIn October 2015, after a successful season with Canterbury in which he was the ITM Cup's joint leading try scorer; he revealed that he had signed a two-year contract with the Dunedin-based for the 2016 Super Rugby season. He found opportunities easier to come by in Dunedin than he had in Christchurch and played 9 times for the tournament defending champions as they made the semi-finals before losing out 42-30 to the in Johannesburg. He was retained in the squad for the 2017 season.\nInternational.\nOn 27 October 2016, Thompson was called up to the Māori All Blacks squad as an injury replacement for Declan O'Donnell ahead of the 2016 end-of-year rugby union internationals, however a hamstring injury picked up during the Mitre 10 Cup final meant that he also had to withdraw and saw his place taken by Ambrose Curtis on 30 October.\nCareer Honours.\nCanterbury"

        "text": "Toombul District Cricket Club is an Australian cricket club based in Nundah, Queensland, in the city of Brisbane.\nOverview.\nThe Toombul District Cricket Club (Toombul DCC or simply TDCC) is a Queensland Cricket Association cricket club which competes in the Queensland Premier Cricket competition, the top level of cricket played in Queensland.\nThe Queensland Premier Cricket competition has grade levels from Premier Grade to Sixth Grade, with Toombul fielding teams across six senior grades, as well as an U/16 Lords Taverners side. Toombul also has a comprehensive junior club, Toombul DCC - Juniors which fields age-group sides from under 6's to under 16's, and a Milo in2Cricket programme.\nToombul is equal with Souths as the most successful cricket club in Queensland, having secured 21 Premier Grade premierships in its history, the most recent coming in the 2012/13 season.\nHistory.\nToombul is one of the oldest sporting clubs in Australia, with records dating the club back to 1882. In 1897/98, Toombul was one of the foundation clubs of what has continued to be the highest level of club cricket played in Queensland, the Queensland Premier Cricket competition.\nToombul has been a breeding ground for Test and First Class representatives over the years, and those from Toombul form a who's who of famous cricketing names (including four of Bradman's 1948 Invincibles).\nToombul's 1948 Invincibles\nToombul's Bill Brown also has the distinct honour of being the first and only native Queenslander to captain the Australian cricket team.\nOther famous Toombul players include:\nToombul's Premier Grade Club Record Partnerships contains a \"who's who\" of famous Toombul names from the post-WWII era. Included are a number of Test and First-Class representatives.\nToombul's 2018/19 season Premier Grade squad includes:\nIn 1972, two Toombul men - Errold La Frantz and Cec Anstey - were instrumental in the formation of the junior cricket competition in north Brisbane, the Brisbane North Junior Cricket Association.\nQueensland Cricket's longest serving official scorer, Judy Harris, is a Toombul DCC life member and began scoring Toombul matches in 1971. From 1986 she served as Queensland Cricket's official scorer, until retiring the pencil in 2014, after scoring over 500 First Class matches including 31 Tests and 63 One-Day Internationals. Upon retirement, a room in the Toombul clubhouse was named The Judy Harris Room in honour of her services to the club.\nGround.\nThe Toombul playing ground is named Oxenham Park, after Toombul club legend Ron Oxenham. The facility incorporates two fields, the main field Ken Mackay Oval, and the second field La Frantz Oval, named after two more club legends, Ken Mackay and Errold La Frantz, respectively.\nFor much of the late 20th century, Nundah was a low socio-economic area, with public housing and vagrants abundant. Due to the difficulty Toombul Cricket Club faced in maintaining the facilities in the face of vandalism, and the homeless setting up camp at the groundsman's shed, Toombul became affectionately known as The Junkyard. \nAround the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, gentrification began to take hold in Nundah, as the wealth from the suburbs directly to its south began to flow northwards. This resulted in a much improved suburb, and Toombul was able to improve the club facilities significantly. While the moniker \"Junkyard\" is no longer applicable, the players and supporters have retained part of the old label, referring to Toombul simply as The Yard.\nThe record attendance for a match at Oxenham Park was on 4 November in the 1931/32 season, when 26,438 people attended to watch Toombul's Second Grade side attempt to bat out a draw and retain 7th spot on the ladder, which they did, much to the delight of the masses of spectators. Unfortunately the fantastic result caused ecstatic jubilation, and eventually utter chaos in the large crowd, which began looting the local shops, and in amongst the mayhem the grandstand, pavilion, and an orphanage near the ground were set alight and burnt down. There was also an unconfirmed report of a fist-fight between several members of the Country Women's Association and the Sisters of Mercy outside the nearby Royal English Hotel.\nFacilities.\nThe Toombul clubhouse underwent a capital works programme to develop the rooftop into a rooftop beer garden. Work commenced on 21 January 2017 and were completed on 15 February 2017. The works included new balustrading, stairs, and astroturf flooring. The rooftop is open to the public as well as Toombul club members.\nThe club has \"The Yard Bar\" rooftop beer garden, canteen, bar facilities, air-conditioned clubrooms, as well as plenty of street parking.\nThe rooftop is available for booking through the club directly."

        "text": "South Brisbane District Cricket Club is a cricket club in South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. They were founded in 1897 and compete in the Queensland Premier Cricket competition.\nSouth Brisbane is the equal most successful side in the Queensland Premier Cricket First-grade competition having 21 Premierships alongside Toombul. They dominated the 1900s winning the premiership in six out of ten seasons in the decade, and also notably won three consecutive premierships from 1962 to 1964, but the club has also achieved success consistently throughout its history winning premierships in every decade except the 1920s and 1950s, however it has not found success in recent years winning its last First-grade premiership in 2001.\nIn the shorter formats South Brisbane won four One-Day titles in the 1980s and has yet to win a T20 title. In women's cricket in 2021 the club announced it was establishing a women's team to compete in women's First-grade cricket beginning in the 2022/23 season.\nHistory.\nEarly teams playing under the name.\nThe current South Brisbane Cricket Club was not established until 1897, however some teams played under the name prior to this. In August 1859 a public meeting was held for South Brisbane residents at a local store for the purpose of organising a cricket club, and in 1861 a South Brisbane cricket team organised a match against a North Brisbane team on Easter Monday on the Green Hills near the Reservoir which poor weather prevented from taking place until April 13. The match was attended by the Governor and his wife and reportedly a noteworthy number of ladies. North Brisbane won the game by four wickets.\nIn 1867 a combined side selected from sixteen independent South Brisbane cricket clubs was selected to play against the eleven from Shafston club at Kangaroo Point, and the South Brisbane team won. In 1872 the South Brisbane Union Cricket Club petitioned the city Municipal Council to be allowed to have exclusive use of an area of land used as a cricket ground in South Brisbane which was used by multiple independent South Brisbane clubs, however the petition was rejected on the grounds that it would be problematic to prevent the other clubs from using the land.\nIn 1888 a meeting was held at the Boundary Hotel to establish a new cricket club to replace the defunct Montague Cricket Club which had been a senior South Brisbane side. The new club initially named itself Belvidere, but forgot to announce its name and when another club was formed with that name it assumed the name South Brisbane Cricket Club instead and chose the colours light-blue and white. It joined a Junior Cricket Association and competed in the 1888–89 season, but was unable to compete in the senior competition. In February 1889 the South Brisbane Cricket Club held a successful Concert and Ball to raise club funds at the West End School of Arts. In April 1889 the club played a Combined Logan District XI in Beaudesert. As of October 1890 the club were competing in a senior competition. In October 1891 a separate club was formed under the name the Second South Brisbane Cricket Club which was to compete in a Junior Cricket Association.\nThe first South Brisbane Cricket Club was still active as of 1896, and played a game as late as March 1897, however in May 1897 the Queensland Cricket Association decided to disband its senior competitions and form a new competition with new clubs based on electorate boundaries.\nEarly years.\nOn 13 August 1897 a general meeting was held in the South Brisbane Council Chambers chaired by the Mayor of South Brisbane at which it was proposed that a South Brisbane electoral cricket club be formally established according to the constitution and rules of the Queensland Cricket Association. The proposition was accepted and the club was formed under the name the South Brisbane Electoral Cricket Club. It was formed with forty members and a club fee of one guinea was set in order to raise funds to construct a proper South Brisbane cricket ground. On August 24, 1897, a committee of the club drove around South Brisbane to identify a suitable area to establish a cricket ground and they decided that one could be built in Musgrave Park. By September 1897 the club had grown to seventy members, however rather than establishing a cricket ground it had secured practice wickets at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, a turf wicket in the Botanic Gardens, and permission to compete at the Brisbane Cricket Ground for A Grade matches and Queen's Park for B Grade matches. \nWilliam Fisher, who had played first-class cricket for Queensland, was made the club's first captain and on September 25 the club played its first game against the North Brisbane Cricket Club at Queen's Park, and its first actual competition match was against Toowong on October 2. South Brisbane won its first fixture against Toowong by an innings and 113 runs. In South Brisbane's first season, 1897–98, the club played six A grade games winning two, losing two, drawing two, and one being forfeited by the opposition. South Brisbane's Sydney Donahoo, who had played First-Class cricket for Victoria, topped the competition run aggregate with 299 runs for the season. The club also fielded a B grade side which played four games winning two but forfeiting two of their scheduled games due to being unable to locate a ground to play on, and at the 1898 club general meeting South Brisbane decided to approach the trustees of Musgrave Park about establishing a turf wicket there. In the 1898–99 season South Brisbane finished bottom of the ladder in the A Grade competition, winning just one of their twelve games and losing the other eleven. 1899–1900 was a better season for the club with W.B. Griffith topping the competition aggregate with 253 runs, although in March 1900 a South Brisbane player was suspended for the remainder of the 1899–1900 season for bad language during a match. In September 1900 the club was informed by the Queensland Cricket Association that the Association could not assist them in establishing or maintaining a wicket, although in October the Association did provide South Brisbane financial assistance.\nSouth Brisbane won the 1900-01 premiership and to celebrate the players were hosted at a dinner by the Mayor of South Brisbane. Alan Marshal had the highest batting average in the premiership season for the club at 33.7, and the most runs in the competition with 329. Tasman Long had the lowest bowling average for the club at 7.6, and H.B. Griffith took 50 wickets which was the most of anyone in district cricket for the season. At the club's 1901 general meeting it decided to re-establish a B grade team and secure a B grade playing wicket in West End reserve, and as of December the club was using West End Reserve. At the 1902 general meeting it was decided that the A grade team would be selected from the club members by a selection committee, with a B grade selection committee then being allowed to select from any remaining club members, rather than players being graded into either class, however at the 1903 general meeting it was decided to have only one three member selection committee. In mid-1903 the club decided to try to secure land in West End Reserve to permanently establish an independent club cricket ground. On 7 September 1903 the South Brisbane Cricket Club emulated its namesake by holding a dance at the West End School of Arts, and it also held a fundraising concert at the School in November.\nSouth Brisbane won the A Grade Premiership again in 1903–04, and their bowler Albert Henry had the best bowling average in the season taking 59 wickets at 9.3. They finished third in the 1904-05 A grade season, however they did not submit any statistics to the Queensland Cricket Association, so no averages were recorded for the club at the time, although it is known that Alan Marshal scored 750 runs, the most in the competition for the season, and scored a 221. In the 1905–06 season South Brisbane finished second losing only three matches and their bowling was cited as a strength with W. B. Hayes being the standout player for the side scoring 500 runs and taking 84 wickets, the record allround season performance in Brisbane grade cricket at the time. In January 1906 Brisbane had three players, T. Faunce, W. B. Hayes, and J. Thomson, selected for a practice match used to select the state side for a match against Victoria.\nSouth Brisbane won the premiership in 1906–07, and went back-to-back also winning the premiership in 1907–08, for which they were awarded the \"Courier Cup\", which the chairman of the Queensland Cricket Association remarked had a \"capacity sufficiently large to carry enough refreshment for the whole team.\" when presenting it to the side. Charles Barstow took 86 and 61 wickets for South Brisbane in the two seasons topping the competition in both. South Brisbane won the premiership in the 1908–09 season with W.B. Hayes taking 83 wickets and topping the competition tally. They also won in 1909–10, achieving four consecutive premierships, with Sidney Redgrave scoring 732 runs to top the competition tally. A highlight for South Brisbane in 1909 was Charles Barstow taking 10 for 34 in an innings.\nIn the 1910–11 season Sidney Redgrave scored six centuries setting the record for centuries in a season in Queensland district cricket, and in 1911-12 South Brisbane batsman Alan Marshal topped the senior season batting for average and aggregate with 778 runs at 58.50. The following season the club won the 1912-13 premiership, with W.B. Hayes again topping the league for wickets with 53, and Leo O'Connor topping the aggregate runs with 429. In 1913 the Queensland Cricket Association restructured electorate cricket in the state allocating the electorate areas of South Brisbane and Kurilpa to the South Brisbane Electorate cricket club, and in 1913-14 six local clubs in South Brisbane and Kurilpa fell under the South Brisbane clubs jurisdiction. Despite not winning South Brisbane was described as one of the strongest sides of the 1913–14 season with K. Hunter topping the season aggregate with 229 runs, and had two players, Sidney Redgrave and Leo O'Connor, selected for the Queensland state side. In 1915 the Queensland Cricket Association suspended the club competition due to the First World War, although in what would have been the 1916–17 season the Association secretary did schedule a handful of friendly matches between sides including South Brisbane.\nAfter WWI.\nOn 3 January 1919 the South Brisbane Club organised a game against a side of soldiers returned from the War to welcome them back. On January 6 the club held a meeting in which plans were made to continue with cricket again due to the end of the war. A district cricket season commenced that year, with Sidney Redgrave captaining South Brisbane, and they finished top of the ladder, but lost to Valley in the final based on first innings score as the game was washed out. C. Sim topped the competition runs for South Brisbane for 1919–20 with 265.\nIn December 1920 the Club decided to rent the Davies Park cricket ground from the South Brisbane City Council, however in October 1921 the ground was vandalised with the match wicket and practice wickets being destroyed. The club had begun playing cricket in the park on Sundays, and around the same time drew the ire of the council for this who sent a letter instructing the club to cease Sunday cricket which South Brisbane felt was condescending. By September 1922 the relationship had mended and the Council and Club collaborated on developing the outfield of Davies Park.\nFirst-class cricketers.\nBelow is a partial list of Souths players who have played first-class cricket."

        "text": "The 2014–15 season was Irish provincial rugby union side Connacht Rugby's fourteenth season competing in the Pro12, and the team's nineteenth season as a professional side. It was also Pat Lam's second season in charge of the side.\nAs well as playing in the Pro12, Connacht competed in the newly established Rugby Challenge Cup, having played in the now-defunct Heineken Cup the previous season. The second-tier side, the Connacht Eagles, competed in the 2014–15 British and Irish Cup.\nSeason.\nBackground.\nThe 2014–15 season saw the Heineken Cup replaced by the 20 team Rugby Champions Cup and the creation of this competition meant the Pro12 standings would have a greater impact on European qualification. Under the previous format, the Pro12 provided a minimum of ten teams, with Scotland and Italy providing two teams each, and Ireland and Wales both providing three.\nThe new system saw one place now being reserved for the highest finishing Pro12 team from each of four participating countries, along with three other qualifiers based solely on league position, for a total of seven teams. The other teams were to be entered in the new second-tier competition, the Rugby Challenge Cup. This meant Connacht were no longer required to finish ahead of another Irish province or rely on an Irish victory in a European tournament to qualify for the top tier of European rugby.\nThe final tournament spot in the 2015–16 Rugby Champions Cup was decided by a playoff involving the Pro12's highest finishing team that is not already qualified, along with the seventh highest finishing clubs from France's Top 14 and the English Premiership.\nOn the player front, Connacht entered the season with a new captain following the forced retirement of Craig Clarke due to persistent concussions. They will also be without the playing services of former captain and centurion Gavin Duffy, whose contract was not renewed the previous season. It was later announced that he was taking up a role with the province's commercial team.\nDue to their 10th-place finish in the 2013–14 Pro12, Connacht were entered into the 2014–15 Rugby Challenge Cup, which replaced the European Challenge Cup, a competition Connacht hadn't competed in since the 2010–11 season. The draw for the Challenge Cup pool stages took place on 10 June 2014, with Connacht named in the same group as Exeter Chiefs, Bayonne and La Rochelle.\nSeptember.\nConnacht opened the season with victories at home against Newport Gwent Dragons and away to Edinburgh. The team then beat provincial rivals Leinster at home, the 10–9 win giving Connacht their first inter-provincial victory since beating Leinster in the same fixture in the 2012–13 season. Connacht experienced their first defeat of the season in the next round, losing to Glasgow Warriors in their final game of the month.\nOctober.\nFollowing their opening defeat of the season to Glasgow, Connacht opened the month of October with a draw at home to Cardiff Blues the following week, but were able to return to winning ways before the first break for European matches, beating Benetton Treviso 6–9 in Italy. Connacht opened their 2014–15 Challenge Cup campaign at the Sportsgrounds on 18 October with a 48–12 bonus point victory over Top 14 side La Rochelle. The following week, however, saw the province beaten 33–13 away to Exeter Chiefs. Connacht's first game after the European break saw them beaten 26–11 in Wales by the Ospreys on Halloween night.\nNovember.\nA break in the league for the November internationals meant that Connacht didn't play a competitive match in the month until 21 November. When they returned to action, Connacht picked up a comfortable bonus point victory over Zebre at home, posting a final score of 43–3. The team followed this with a 14–8 win against 6th place rivals Scarlets at the Sportsgrounds to keep their unbeaten home record intact.\nDecember.\nConnacht opened the month of December with a crucial double-header against Bayonne in the Challenge Cup, and won the first of these games comfortably, picking up a bonus point in a 42–19 victory to narrow the gap to Exeter Chiefs. Connacht named an entirely new team for the return leg, and despite being 11 points down in the second half, the team fought back to win 27–29, with academy scrum-half Caolin Blade scoring both tries.\nAfter the two European matches, Connacht finished 2015 with two provincial derbies in a row over the Christmas period. Connacht lost the first of these matches against Leinster in Dublin. This loss was followed by a narrow away defeat to Ulster on St. Stephen's Day in the last match of the calendar year.\nJanuary.\nOn New Year's Day, Connacht picked up where they had left off in 2014, with another league match against Irish opposition. In the final derby of this period, Connacht managed to pick up a win, beating Munster 24–16. Following this high however, Connacht were beaten at home for the first time in the season, losing 13–16 to Edinburgh. The poor form was carried into Europe as Connacht lost another home match in quick succession, being beaten 24–33 by the Exeter Chiefs. The team was able to recover the following week to beat La Rochelle and secure a place in the knock-out stage of the competition.\nFebruary.\nThere were no games in the opening weekend of the month as the 2015 Six Nations Championship was taking place. On 15 February Connacht returned to league action, suffering a 32–14 loss away to Scarlets. The following week, Connacht were away to another Welsh side, this time facing Newport Gwent Dragons, and recovered from the previous week's disappointment to emerge 25–30 winners.\nMarch.\nConnacht opened the month of March with bonus point victory over Benetton Treviso, crushing the Italians 53–5. On 6 March, Connacht faced Cardiff Blues away ahead of a tough series of matches against teams in the play-off places, making the game important in the qualification for the 2015–16 Rugby Champions Cup. Connacht were beaten 18–17 by a late try, after the referee controversially gave a penalty against Connacht with the game in overtime after Cardiff appeared to have knocked the ball on. In the aftermath of the game, Pat Lam criticised touch judge Leighton Hodges and lodged a complaint with the league. Lam was later charged with misconduct for his comments. In spite of Lam's comments and the misconduct charge, Hodges refereed Connacht's next match, away to Munster in Thomond Park, where Connacht were beaten 42–20.\nApril.\nThe team's first match in April was a Challenge Cup quarter-final against Gloucester in Kingsholm Stadium. After going in 14–0 down, Connacht held the hosts scoreless in the second half and pulled themselves back into the match with a penalty try. They couldn't make up the deficit however, and Connacht were knocked out of the Cup by 14–7.\nIn their return to the Pro12, Connacht suffered their second home league defeat of the season, this time to Ulster. After another poor first half performance, Connacht went in 17–0 down, only to earn a losing bonus with a final score of 20–27. Another home defeat followed, with the team shipping five tries against Glasgow Warriors in a 13–31 defeat, leaving the team in danger of finishing behind Edinburgh in 8th place and missing not only automatic qualification for the Champions Cup, but also the chance at a play-off for the final spot.\nMay.\nConnacht were able to start the month with their first win since 1 March, beating Zebre 10–40 in Italy, to earn a try bonus and leave themselves with a chance of reaching the Champions Cup. In the final round of the regular season, on 16 May, Connacht faced Ospreys, while their rivals for the Champions Cup places, Scarlets and Edinburgh, faced Benetton Treviso and Leinster respectively. Connacht picked up a losing bonus, while Scarlets won and Edinburgh were beaten by 13, leaving Connacht in 7th place, their highest finish in a regular league season, but just short of qualification to the Champions Cup.\nConnacht proceeded to a play-off involving Bordeaux Bègles, the 7th placed team in the 2014–15 Top 14 season, and Gloucester the 2014–15 Rugby Challenge Cup winners. Connacht played Gloucester away on 24 May for the chance to face Bordeaux. Connacht were leading 18–25 in the final minutes of the game, but a controversial penalty decision from Romain Poite gave Gloucester a try-scoring opportunity and sent the match to extra time, after which Gloucester emerged 40–32 victors.\nPlayers.\nAcademy squad.\n year 1\n year 1\n year 2\n year 2\n year 2\n year 3\n year 2\n year 2\n year 1\n year 2\n year 2\n year 2\n year 1\n year 2\n year 1\n year 1\n year 2\nPlaying kit.\nConnacht's official kit supplier for the season was Australian manufacturer BLK sport, who announced a comprehensive four-year agreement to supply the full range of apparel for all of Connacht Rugby's representative teams and support staff in 2013.\nConnacht's main shirt sponsors were Irish sporting retailer Lifestyle Sports.

A total of 56 teams competed in the qualifying phase and play-off round to decide 10 of the 32 places in the group stage of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League.\nAll times were CEST ().\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nFormat.\nIn the qualifying phase and play-off round, each tie was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time was played, divided into two 15-minute halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided by draw. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA formed \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.\nTeams.\nThere were two routes which the teams were separated into during qualifying:\nA total of 56 teams (41 in Champions Route, 15 in League Route) were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round.

The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting this season):\nMoreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There were other restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g., Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, Chelsea and Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United) in general did not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tried to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control), and teams in certain countries (e.g., Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan) did not play at home on the last matchday (due to cold weather and simultaneous kick-off times).\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries. Therefore, Ukrainian clubs Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv (both Pot 3), and Russian clubs Zenit Saint Petersburg (Pot 1) and CSKA Moscow (Pot 3) could not be drawn into the same group.\nTeams.\nBelow are the 32 teams which qualified for the group stage (with their 2015 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot.

A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\nFormat.\nThe knockout phase involved the 16 teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage.\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule would be applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time would be played. The away goals rule would be again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team would advance by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie would be decided by penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if scores were level at the end of normal time, extra time would be played, followed by penalty shoot-out if scores remained tied.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nThe draw was held on 14 December 2015.

        "title": "2016 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2016 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League, the 61st season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 24th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, on 28 May 2016, between Spanish teams Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, in a repeat of the 2014 final. It was the second time in the tournament's history that both finalists were from the same city. Real Madrid won 5–3 on a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw at the end of extra time, securing a record-extending 11th title in the competition.\nReal Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup. They also qualified to enter the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative, ultimately triumphing in both competitions.\nVenue.\nThe San Siro, officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, was announced as the venue of the final at the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, on 18 September 2014, the fourth European Cup/Champions League final hosted at the stadium following those in 1965, 1970 and 2001.\nThe San Siro was built in 1925, opened in 1926 as the home of Milan, and was sold to the city in 1935. Internazionale became tenants in 1947, and the stadium has been shared by the two clubs ever since, with Inter winning the first European Cup final played at the stadium in 1965. The stadium was used as a venue in the 1934 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980, and the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Its current capacity is 80,018, but is reduced to just under 80,000 seats for UEFA competitions.\nThe 2016 final marked the first time a final has been held at the San Siro when neither of its tenants were able to win the competition, as Milan and Internazionale both failed to qualify for any European competitions after their performance in the 2014–15 Serie A.\nBackground.\nThis final was the sixth tournament final to feature two teams from the same association, the third all-Spanish final, and the second between teams from the same city, fielding exactly the two teams that faced each other in the 2014 final, making it the seventh repeated final pairing. The all-Madrid final also guaranteed the city of Madrid becoming the most successful city in the European Cup with 11 wins and 17 final appearances, and also in all UEFA club competitions with 16 wins, overtaking the city of Milan with 10 wins and 16 final appearances in the European Cup and 15 wins in all UEFA club competitions.\nReal Madrid reached a record 14th final after a 1–0 aggregate win against Manchester City, with a chance to win a record 11th title. Previously, they won finals in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2014, and lost in 1962, 1964 and 1981. This was also their 18th final in all UEFA club competitions, having also played in two Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986). Their manager, Zinedine Zidane, who scored the winning goal for Real Madrid in the 2002 final, was aiming to become the seventh man to win the Champions League as both player and manager, joining Miguel Muñoz, Giovanni Trapattoni, Johan Cruyff, Carlo Ancelotti, Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola. The team had had a disastrous first half of the season, being left out of contention to win La Liga, sacking Rafael Benítez in January and leaving the Champions League to save their season from being trophy-less.\nAtlético Madrid reached their third European Cup final after defeating Bayern Munich on away goals (2–2 on aggregate). Their previous two European Cup finals in 1974 and 2014 both ended in defeats, to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid respectively. Atlético Madrid had also played in three Cup Winners' Cup finals (winning in 1962, and losing in 1963 and 1986) and two Europa League finals (winning in 2010 and 2012), with their most recent Europa League triumph in 2012 led by current coach Diego Simeone, widely attributed as having brought Atlético Madrid back to glory, but had yet to win a Champions League. He had the chance to join fellow Argentinians Luis Carniglia and Helenio Herrera as the only non-European coaches to win the European Cup/Champions League. Had they won the final, they would have become the first Spanish club and the fifth club overall to have won all three major European trophies (European Cup/Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League and the now-defunct Cup Winners' Cup). On the other hand, if they were to lose, they would become the first team to lose their first three European Cup finals.\nApart from the 2014 final, won by Real Madrid 4–1 after extra time, the only previous Madrid Derby matches in European competitions were in the 1958–59 European Cup semi-finals, where Real Madrid won 2–1 in a replay, after a 2–2 aggregate draw, and in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, where Real Madrid won 1–0 on aggregate.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nAmbassadors.\nThe ambassadors for the final were former Argentine international Javier Zanetti, who won the Champions League with Internazionale against Bayern Munich in 2010, and former Italian international Paolo Maldini, who won five European Cups with Milan.\nLogo.\nUEFA unveiled the brand identity of the final on 27 August 2015 in Monaco ahead of the group stage draw. The logo features the Milan landmark Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.\nTicketing.\nWith a stadium capacity of 71,500, a total amount of 46,000 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 20,000 tickets each and with 6,000 tickets being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 1 to 14 March 2016 in four price categories: €440, €320, €160 and €70. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme.\nOpening ceremony.\nAmerican singer Alicia Keys performed in the opening ceremony prior to the match, the first time the UEFA Champions League final featured a live music performance. The UEFA Champions League Anthem was performed by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\nRelated events.\nThe 2016 UEFA Women's Champions League final was held two days prior, on 26 May 2016, at the Mapei Stadium – Città del Tricolore in Reggio Emilia.\nThe annual UEFA Champions Festival was held between 26–29 May 2016 at Milan's Piazza del Duomo.\nMatch.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2016, English referee Mark Clattenburg was chosen to adjudicate the final. Joining him, were compatriots Simon Beck and Jake Collin as assistant referees, Andre Marriner and Anthony Taylor as additional assistant referees, Stuart Burt as reserve assistant referee, and Hungarian Viktor Kassai as fourth official.\nGoal-line technology.\nThe goal-line technology system Hawk-Eye was used for the match. This was the first UEFA Champions League final to employ goal-line technology, following approval by the UEFA Executive Committee in January 2016.\nSummary.\nReal Madrid dominated possession in the early stages of the match. Six minutes into the game Gareth Bale delivered a free-kick into Atlético Madrid's penalty box, which found Casemiro. His goalbound shot was cleared off the line by goalkeeper Jan Oblak. Five minutes later, Dani Carvajal received the first yellow card of the match after a late tackle on Antoine Griezmann. In the 15th minute, Toni Kroos sent a free-kick into Atlético's penalty box, which was flicked on by Bale. In the subsequent scramble, Sergio Ramos touched the ball past Oblak to score for Real. Watching the goal back at half-time, referee Clattenburg realised that there had been an offside in the build-up to the goal and that it should not have stood.\nIn the 46th minute, Fernando Torres won a penalty kick for Atlético after a foul from behind from Pepe. Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas was shown a yellow card for delaying the kick. Griezmann took the penalty but his shot missed the goal, with the ball ricocheting off the crossbar. Substitute Yannick Carrasco latched onto a cross by Juanfran from the right to equalise from close range for Atlético in the 79th minute. The scoreline remained the same at the end of 90 minutes to send the match into extra time.\nAfter a goalless extra 30 minutes, the game was settled by a penalty shoot-out. Juanfran missed Atlético's fourth penalty, hitting the post, thus allowing Cristiano Ronaldo to seal Real Madrid's 11th Champions League title.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the semi-final draw, which was held on 15 April 2016 at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nRamos, who scored the opening goal of the match, became the fifth player to score in two Champions League finals. He had not scored in the competition since scoring the equaliser against Atlético Madrid in the 2014 final. Carrasco's second-half equaliser made him the first Belgian to score in a Champions League final. Real Madrid coach Zidane became the first French coach to win the Champions League and the seventh person to win the Champions League as a player and as a coach.\nDuring the match, fans at an Iraqi Real Madrid fan club were attacked for the second time, bringing the combined death toll to at least 29. In the aftermath of the attack, club president Florentino Pérez dedicated Real Madrid's victory to the fans that were killed and other Iraqi fans of the club, including others who have been killed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Players had previously worn black armbands and observed moment of silence after the first attack.\nReactions.\nZidane expressed his pride at being Real Madrid coach and winning the Champions League with the club as a player, as assistant coach and now as head coach. Simeone congratulated Real Madrid on their victory. When asked if he would continue as the coach of Atlético Madrid, Simeone replied, \"My plan is to think. That's all.\"\nRonaldo told the media after the match that he had requested to take the fifth penalty because he \"had a vision\" that he would score the winning goal. Luka Modrić told the media he was happy and proud of the win, and that the team had shown character until the end."

        "title": "1974 World Team Tennis season",
        "text": "The 1974 World Team Tennis season was the inaugural season of the top professional team tennis league in the United States. The Denver Racquets defeated the Philadelphia Freedoms in the WTT Finals to win the league's first championship.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1974 World Team Tennis season included 16 teams split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). The Eastern Division was further split into two sections (Atlantic and Central) which each had four teams. The Western Division was also split into two sections (Gulf Plains and Pacific) which also had four teams each. Each team played a 44-match regular-season schedule with 22 home and 22 away matches. The section champions and the two teams in each division with the best records among non section champions qualified for the division championship semifinals. The team with the best record among playoff qualifiers from the division played the team with the fourth best record in the semifinals. The teams with the second and third best records played each other in the semifinals. Teams were not given preference in seeding based on being champions of their section. The semifinal winners met the other semifinals winners from their own division to determine the division champions. The division champions met in the World Team Tennis Final.\nAt the start of the season, each match comprised two sets of men's singles, two sets of women's singles and two sets of mixed doubles. No men's doubles or women's doubles were played. The mixed doubles sets were played as the third and sixth sets. The coach of the home team decided whether to play men's or women's singles first and fourth or second and fifth. WTT changed the match format on May 18, 1974, to one set each of men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles, because of concern that the matches were taking too long. The order of play was women's doubles first, men's doubles third and mixed doubles fifth. The coach of the home team decided whether men's or women's singles would be played second or fourth. Games were decided by the first player or doubles team to reach four points with no-ad scoring. Each set ended when one team had won either six or seven games and had an advantage over its opponent of at least two games. Sets that were tied 6–6 were decided by a tiebreaker. Set tiebreaker games were nine total points with the first player or doubles team to reach five the winner. An advantage of only one point was needed to win a tiebreaker game. Matches could end when one team built an insurmountable lead. For example, if a team had a 24–17 lead after four sets, the fifth set (mixed doubles) would not be played. If a team had a 22–19 lead after four sets, the match could end if the leading team won four games in the fifth set, since it would be impossible for the trailing team to make up the three-game deficit that existed when the set started. If the match was tied at the end of five sets, a super tiebreaker game was played between the mixed doubles teams using the same format as the set tiebreaker games. Teams often agreed to play dead sets even if the outcome of the match had already been decided or to play sets to completion when the outcome of the match was decided within that set.\nPlayoff matchups in the division semifinals and division championship series were played in two legs with each team hosting one match and the cumulative score determining the winner. The higher seed had the choice to host either the first or the second match. Should the cumulative score be tied after the conclusion of the second match, a series tiebreaker game was played to determine the series winner. The WTT Finals were a best-of-three series. The lower seed hosted the first match. The higher seed hosted the second match and the third, if necessary.\nCharter franchises and relocation.\nOn May 22, 1973, WTT announced the formation of the league with the following 16 franchises:\nAs shown in the above table, the Pittsburgh Triangles had a team name from the time the franchise was chartered.\nOn May 30, 1973, the San Diego franchise announced that it had adopted the name San Diego Swingers.\nBefore the WTT inaugural draft on August 3, 1973, the St. Louis franchise had relocated and was referred to as the Miami franchise at the draft.\nAlso before the draft, the Cincinnati franchise had been sold to Joseph Zingale and relocated to Cleveland.\nFinally, by the time the inaugural draft took place, the San Francisco franchise had adopted the name the Golden Gate Otters\nand was referred to as the Golden Gate franchise during the draft.\nOn August 21, 1973, the New York franchise announced it had adopted the name New York Sets.\nBy September 1973, the Los Angeles franchise had been named the Los Angeles Strings.\nBefore the start of the 1974 season, the Phoenix franchise was sold to Howard Fine, Gerald Klauber, Joseph Rivkin and Robert E. Bradley, Jr. who moved it to Baltimore.\nAlso before the start of the 1974 season, the San Diego Swingers were sold to Don Kelleher who moved them to Honolulu.\nFinally, before the start of the 1974 season, the Golden Gate Otters decided to simply call the team the Golden Gaters in dealings with the public. Since it would have been absurd to call the team the Golden Gate Golden Gaters, and the league used a location to identify all its teams, WTT reverted to using San Francisco, the location for which the original charter was issued, when referring to the team. They were listed in official WTT standings as the San Francisco Golden Gaters.\nThe remaining charter franchises adopted names before the start of the 1974 season. The team identification and naming history of the 16 charter franchises from the founding of WTT to the start of the inaugural season is as follows:\nInaugural draft.\nWTT conducted a lottery to determine the order of selection for its inaugural draft held on August 3, 1973. The selection order determined as a result of the lottery was used for odd-numbered rounds, and it was reversed for even-numbered rounds. Each team was entitled to select 20 players. Teams that could sign players to contracts before the draft had to identify these players as preferential choices and use their earliest picks on the players signed. The players selected in the first 10 rounds of the draft are shown in the tables below.\nNotes:\nStandings and attendance.\n\"Reference:\" \nTotal attendance during the season was 833,966, for an average of 2,369 over 352 playing dates.\nPlayoff bracket.\n\"Reference:\" \nPlayoff match results.\n\"Reference:\" \nWTT Finals.\nOf the total of 14 playoff matches, home teams won only 6 and lost 8. The higher seeds had 3 wins and 4 losses in their 7 home matches. The higher seeds won 5 of the 7 series.\nIndividual statistical leaders.\nThe table below shows the individual players and doubles teams who had the best winning percentages in each of the five events in WTT.\nIndividual honors.\n\"Reference:\" "

Big Tot got hit by a pitched ball and Smith was safe on a fielder's choice with one out. Woodruf flied out to right. Tyner slammed one to center which Jetty juggled and everybody advanced a pair of sacks. Ryan was safe on another error and two runs came over.

He learned the game of rugby league at Kogarah Marist Brothers, where he attended as a student. He made his first grade début in St George's foundation year in 1921, and went on to play his whole career at the club between 1921 and 1929. He had scored the first try in St. George's first competition match on 3 April 1921, in a game that saw Glebe defeat St. George 4–3. At years end, he was selected to play on the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, thus making Carstairs St. George's first international player. He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 123. He played in the 2nd and 3rd test matches on that tour. This happened to be his last representative appearance, either for Australia or his state.

However, despite these difficulties it continued to attract some of Britain's top amateur competitions, including the 1956 Brabazon Trophy and the English Amateur in 1952, 1963 and 1971.\nHaving recovered financially, the 9-hole Channel course was designed by Fred Hawtree and built in 1977, bringing the total number of holes available to members up to the present-day number of 27.\nIn more recent years the championship course has continued to host several top amateur competitions. It has hosted the Brabazon Trophy a further 2 times in 1990 and 2006 and the English Amateur a further 2 times in 1981 and 2006.

The tour was originally scheduled to consist of three Test matches, five One Day International matches and one Twenty20 International match. The ODI series was reduced from five matches to four, after the third match was cancelled due to Cyclone Hudhud.\nOn the day of the commencement of the series, the West Indies players threatened not to come to the ground unless they were paid their due amount by the WICB. After BCCI intervention, the WICB promised to pay their players and the series started. On 17 October 2014, during the toss time, West Indies ODI captain Dwayne Bravo brought the entire team with him and announced that they are abandoning the rest of the tour because they didn't receive their promised payment from the WICB. Later the BCCI confirmed that the remaining fixtures of the tour after the 4th ODI game had been cancelled, due to an ongoing pay between the West Indies players, the West Indies Cricket Board and the players association. A senior BCCI official confirmed the development, saying the West Indies team management had informed the board of their decision earlier in the day. Sri Lanka have agreed in principle to play five ODIs in November in India following the West Indies abandoning the matches. Subsequently, the BCCI announced that it would suspend all further planned tours of the West Indies until further notice, and would undertake legal action against the WICB for the premature ending of the India tour.\nIn June 2016, India confirmed they would honour their tour to the West Indies, scheduled to take place the following month."

        "title": "2015–16 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup",
        "text": "The International Ski Federation (FIS) Alpine World Cup tour is the premier circuit for alpine skiing competition. The inaugural season launched in January 1967, and the 2016 season marked the 50th consecutive year for the FIS. This World Cup season began on 24 October 2015, in Sölden, Austria, and concluded in Saint Moritz, Switzerland on 20 March 2016. The World Ski Championship, a biennial event, did not interrupt this competitive season, and the upcoming World Championships were held Saint Moritz, Switzerland in February 2017 \nMen.\nBy late December 2015, the season had seen year-ending injuries to two top skiers. Austrian Matthias Mayer suffered severe spinal damage in the downhill competition at Gröden in Val Gardena, Italy, and German Josef Ferstl damaged his knee during training in Santa Caterina, Italy on the downhill course. Despite his broken back, Mayer is optimistic about returning for a 2017 World Cup try following his much debated crash. During the crash that injured Mayer, another World Cup \"first\" took place when the 'body airbag' he was wearing inflated. The new protective gear, now worn by many skiers, has never been deployed during a World Cup competition prior to this. The system is designed to minimize severe thoracic injuries, like the one Mayer suffered, by deploying quickly during tumbles and mishap. Emergency responders could see that the \"airbag\" had engaged as designed before they even knew about the broken spine. It has not been determined if the \"protective gear\" prevented worse injury, promoted the injury that was received, or had no effect in the matter.\nAn odd incident marred the early season as a small, remotely-piloted camera helicopter, operated by broadcast media, nearly foiled Marcel Hirscher's podium effort by crashing during his run and narrowly missing him. A day after the incident, the International Ski Federation adopted the policy of banning remotely-piloted vehicles from flying over their events as a matter of safety and concern for the welfare of their athletes, staff and viewers. Senior Race Director Markus Waldner stated his displeasure with the occurrence and insisted that the ban will remain in effect as long as he is on the job. The newly introduced \"parallel giant slalom\" event at Alta Badia, Italy, was a relatively short Giant slalom course that pitted the men against one another in a modified bracket-reduction format from thirty-two 1st run skiers, to sixteen 2nd bracket skiers that eventually dwindled to just four final round racers. The \"Snow Queen Trophy\" slalom planned for Sljême, Croatia was cancelled and diverted to Santa Caterina, Italy for lack of snow, while the early season slalom in Levi, Finland suffered similar conditions, but could not find a home to reschedule to in the very busy year.\nBy mid-season, the World Cup overall leader, as well as Downhill and Super-G discipline leader, Aksel Lund Svindal was out following a crash during the downhill at Kitzbühel. He suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee and needed immediate surgery. Georg Streitberger of Austria also suffered a season-ending knee injury in the same race, which was ended after only thirty skiers left the starting gate. Poor visibility, and the number of serious crashes that were occurring, prompted race officials to halt the event at the minimum skiers required to have it qualify as a complete event.\nWomen.\nThe first part of the season produced many injuries to several top skiers. Sara Hector severely injured her knee in giant slalom, during the competition in Åre, Sweden, and two event champions from the previous season, Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin missed several events due to recent incidents. Vonn missed the October and November events to continue rehabilitating from last year's season-ending injury, and from a recent dog bite from one of her pets. Shiffrin dropped-out in mid-December to recuperate from an injury suffered during practice at Åre. Shiffrin's recovery was not immediate and she missed the heart of the race season, however, she returned to the circuit in mid-February and promptly dominated the competition. The lack of snowy weather eliminated the women's race weekend at St. Anton's, Austria, two weeks before the planned event. Officials recognized that they did not have enough snow on the ground, and that they did not have the ability to generate enough man-made snow for safe racing. The events were quickly relocated to Zauchensee, Austria, for the same dates. A few days later, officials cancelled the \"Snow Queen Trophy\" slalom planned at Sljême, Croatia. The stop was the only one planned for Croatia this season, and was one of the few joint stops on tour where male and female teammates crossed paths during the year. The slalom event was quickly rescheduled to Santa Caterina, Italy on consecutive days.\nThe middle of the season saw a significant reshuffle of many of the events throughout The Alps. Six events were cancelled in January for unseasonably warm weather and \"insufficient\" snow. The events were promptly repositioned to snowier venues further down the schedule. In contrast, mid-February saw a few events abandoned due to soft and \"excessive snow\", over two meters in one instance... a significant safety concern for the high speed disciplines. At the end of the February, during the Super-G in Soldeu, Vonn, having just returned from injury seven weeks earlier, crashed again while leading near the end of her run. She raced the next day in the Combined event, earned a few points, then ended her season on Monday after a complete medical evaluation in Barcelona revealed several hairline fractures in her knee. At the time of her departure, she had already won the downhill discipline for the season and was leading the overall, super-G and combined disciplines.\nNotable skiers that did not participate this year include: Anna Fenninger, the defending World Cup champion who was forced to skip the season due to a serious knee injury. Tina Maze, last season's runner-up decided to take a short hiatus during the 2016 season before permanently deciding to continue, or end, her World Cup career. Champion skier Julia Mancuso decided to opt for hip surgery in November, 2015, instead of rushing back after non-surgical therapy failed to give her the full recovery she had hoped for. Her stated goal is to get back to winning form in time to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.\nNations Cup.\nOverall\nMen\nWomen"

It began on 21 November 2015 in Klingenthal, Germany and concluded on 20 March 2016 in Planica, Slovenia.\nFor men, the title holders from the previous season were Severin Freund in overall, Peter Prevc in ski flying, and Germany in the nations cup. For ladies, Daniela Iraschko-Stolz was defending the overall title and Austria the nations cup.\nAlmaty and the country of Kazakhstan hosted ski jumping World Cup events for the first time in history. Several events had to be cancelled or rescheduled to other venues due to weather conditions. The cancelled individual event from Titisee-Neustadt was replaced in Planica on 17 March 2016, which meant that Letalnica bratov Gorišek became the first hill in history to host four World Cup events in a row.\nMap of world cup hosts.\nAll 24 locations hosting world cup events for men (21) and ladies (10) in this season. Events in Kuusamo/Ruka and Râșnov were completely canceled.\n \nMen.\nSummary.\nPeter Prevc, who was the runner-up in the previous two seasons, dominated the men's season. Prevc secured his first World Cup title by winning the second event in Almaty, six events before the end of the season. At the end of the season, Prevc broke several statistical records. He won the highest number of points in a single season (2303, the previous record being 2083 of Gregor Schlierenzauer from the 2008/09 season) and also recorded the highest number of victories, podium finishes, and average points per event in a season (15 victories, 22 podiums, and 79.41 points on average, the previous records being 13 victories, 20 podiums, and 77.15 points on average from Schlierenzauer's 2008/09 season). The point difference between the first and the second, 813 points, was also the highest ever. By winning the sky flying title, Prevc became the first ski jumper to win the title for three years in a row. In the overall standings, the defending champion Severin Freund finished second and Kenneth Gangnes finished third.\nPrevc also won the prestigious 64th Four Hills Tournament. The tournament was broadcast in 57 different countries for 200 million viewers around the globe. Prevc won the competition with the highest total score ever with 1139.4 points and won three events out of four. At the FIS Ski Flying World Championships, which did not count for World Cup points, Prevc became the world champion in sky flying.\nThe event on 19 December 2015 in Engelberg, Switzerland, marked some interesting statistical features: Peter Prevc and Domen Prevc became first brothers in history who shared a ski jumping World Cup podium; Noriaki Kasai became the oldest contestant on a podium at 43 years and 196 days old; for the first time the oldest Noriaki Kasai (43) and the youngest Domen Prevc (16) participant of any competition both on podium and with record age difference between two on podium. The Prevc brothers finished on the podium again in Sapporo, where they were joined by Robert Kranjec.\nPrevc also became only the third ski jumper who managed to win the event with falling or touching the ground upon landing, by winning the ski flying event in Vikersund on 14 February. Such a feat was previously achieved only by Andreas Goldberger in 1995 and Martin Schmitt in 1999.\nIn team events, Norway won three times, Germany twice, and Slovenia once. The Nations Cup was won by Norway, followed by Slovenia and Germany.\nA total of 111,000 people (2,500 / 20,500 / 22,500 / 32,500 / 33,000) has gathered at hill test and four days of competitions at the season final in Planica.\nLadies.\nSummary.\nSara Takanashi of Japan won her third overall title. She won 14 out of 17 events and secured the title several events before the end of the season. Daniela Iraschko-Stolz, the title holder from the previous year, finished second, while Maja Vtič finished third. No team events for ladies or mixed team events were scheduled this season.\nThe Nations Cup was won by Austria, followed by Japan and Slovenia. Since the last two events of the season were cancelled due to lack of snow, the award ceremony took place in Planica, together with men's."

        "text": "An equestrian statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, stands on the north side of Hyde Park Corner, London. The open space in which it stands, now the centre of a large roundabout, was once called Wellington Place.\nDescription and history.\nThe statue portrays the Iron Duke on a campaign, mounted on his horse Copenhagen, with all hooves planted on the ground. It was executed in bronze by the sculptor Joseph Boehm and unveiled in 1888. The figures at the corners of the pedestal representative British soldiers, a Grenadier, a Scottish Highlander, an Irish Dragoon and a Welsh Fusilier. Wellington has a telescope in his right hand.\nThe statue faces Apsley House, which was Wellington's London home.\nThis gives the unintended impression that the Duke's back is turned on the processional way that runs through the open space in which the statue stands. The bronze statue stands on a plinth of pink Peterhead granite from Stirlinghill quarry, near Boddam, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The grey dais forming the base is made of Aberdeen granite from the Rubislaw quarry, Aberdeen.\nThe bronze came from captured French cannons. On one side of the plinth is inscribed and on the other in raised bronze characters.\nAn earlier, 1846 equestrian statue of the Duke, by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, once surmounted the nearby Wellington Arch. It was considered to be too large for the arch and was removed in 1882–83. It is now located at Aldershot Camp, Hampshire. Boehm's statue was commissioned to compensate for the removal of Wyatt's. The current statue is not to be confused with the nearby Wellington Monument, the first monument to the Duke of Wellington, which stands 150 metres away in Hyde Park."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Israel",
        "text": "Ice hockey in Israel started as a minor sport. Until the construction of the new arena in Holon, many Israeli hockey players were members of the Canada Israel Hockey School (since renamed the \"Hockey Academy of Israel\") housed at the Canada Centre in Metulla.\nHistory.\nIce Hockey has been played in Israel since 1986 when Israel's first ice rink opened in Kiryat Motzkin. In 1988 after the second rink opened in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, the Israel Ice Hockey and Figure Skating Association was founded in 1988 by immigrants from Canada , America, Europe and the former Soviet Union. Israel joined the International Ice Hockey Federation in 1991 and first participated in an IIHF world championships in 1992.\nDuring the 1990s there was a large influx of Russian immigrants to Israel, some of whom were professional ice hockey players. Boris Mindel, one of these immigrants, established a junior program at the Canada Centre in Metulla, in northern Israel.\nRoger Neilson, former coach in the National Hockey League, helped to create summer ice hockey camps in Metulla in 1998.\nThe Canada Israel Hockey School (recently renamed the Hockey Academy of Israel) runs a recreational program at the Canada Centre that is open to youngsters of all faiths. In 2014, it had an enrollment of 450 Jewish and Arab youngsters. In 2014, forty players were Alawites from Ghajar on the Lebanese border.\nIce Hockey Federation of Israel.\nThe Ice Hockey Federation of Israel is recognized as the governing body of Ice Hockey in Israel by the Ministry of Education's Sports Authority.\nIsraeli League.\nThe Israeli League is the top tier hockey league in Israel. It was founded in 1990 with 6 teams.\nCurrently (2019) the Senior-A top division consists of 12 teams, divided into upper and lower group, from 10 major clubs:\nThe IcePeaks arena in Holon created a major impact on the number of senior teams in Israel.\nIsrael national ice hockey team.\nThe Israel national ice hockey team has been a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation since 1 May 1991. The men's team is currently ranked 34th, and the women's team is not ranked. As of April 2017 Israel had 901 total players: 345 Male, 513 Junior and 43 females. Additionally they have 29 referees and 4 indoor rinks.\nThe national team, in the 2013 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship Division II Group B, won the gold medal. As a result, the team was promoted to Division II Group A. In 5 games played they were able to defeat China, Turkey, New Zealand and Bulgaria while suffering their only loss to Mexico.\nMaccabiah Games.\nIn 1997, during the 15th Maccabiah Games Ice Hockey was included for the first time, with Team Canada winning the inaugural gold medal. Once again in 2013, Ice Hockey joined for the 19th Maccabiah Games as an official sport.\nFunding was extremely low for the Ice Hockey team and the sport was nearly removed from the games. Owners of 6 NHL teams (Edmonton Oilers, Anaheim Ducks, Philadelphia Flyers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning) funded the sports, enabling it to officially join for the first time.\nSeveral NHL team owners also helped fund the hockey program in the 20th Maccabiah games in 2017, in which three tournaments took place – an open tournament, a junior one (for players up to 18 years of age), and a senior one (for players 40 years of age and over). For the sake of the tournament, a temporary full-size rink was established at the Pais Arena basketball hall in Jerusalem. The capacity of the arena (10000 for hockey) and its proximity to population centers in Israel made the tournament an attraction for thousands of fans, with the final game of the open tournament, in which Canada beat the United States 7:2, attracting an attendance of 7000 and becoming the highest attended hockey game in history on Israeli soil.\nRinks.\nCurrently there are two main rinks in full-time ice hockey use in Israel. \"Canada Centre\" in Israel is the original and biggest ice hockey arena in Israel.\nIn 2010 it was announced that Israel would be getting their second rink, in Eilat. The Ice Park &amp; Mall Eilat offers a full ice rink on the main floor, along with other entertainment features, and a full mall on the upper level, but that rink is not equipped for hockey and hockey activity does not take place there. Additionally a third, smaller rink, is located in Ma'alot, and another one in Holon. The rink in Hollon which is a smaller rink is used constantly for the Leagues Games run by the Federation. An Olympic size rink is in the process of being built with a hope to open in 2023.There is another rink which opened in 2018 called OneIce which is situated in Tnuvot.\nCanadian Friends of Israel Hockey.\nThe \"Canadian Friends of the Israel Ice Hockey Federation\" was founded in 1991 by David Lisbona and Larry Markowitz. After meeting immigrant and Canadian ex-pat Paul Shindman, the founder of the IIHFSA, Lisbona and Markowitz set up the Canadian Friends in order to provide skates and equipment, and help popularize the sport in Israel. It now focuses all of its efforts on the Canada-Israel Hockey School program. While it is based out of Montreal, there are other collection efforts throughout the country, primarily in Ottawa. The organization has an affiliation with the \"Hockey without Borders\" program\nIn December 2017, the organization collected and sent hundreds of jockstraps to Israel."

        "text": "The Vatican Cricket Team is an amateur cricket team established by the Vatican to help establish ties between the Catholic Church and countries and regions where the sport is popular including India and the Caribbean and to encourage inter-faith dialogue.\nHistory.\nPrior to the official establishment of the Vatican Cricket Team, an ad hoc Vatican team played its first (international) match against the Dutch Fellowing Of Oddly Odd Countries Cricket Club. The match-date was 13 September 2008 and the venue being the Stadio dei Marmi. Using an impromptu pitch the Vatican team scored 107 runs for just one wicket. FFOP C.C. was all out for 58, in a 35 over match. \nThe first cricket match played by the Vatican Cricket Team was in May 2008, a friendly match against Roma Capannelle Cricket Club, with the Serie A club winning the match.\nIn 2013, the \"St Peter's Cricket Club\", initially the idea of Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy, announced its formation. The club was tasked with recruiting players from among the \"300 seminarians and priests housed at Catholic colleges and seminaries around Rome\", not therefore citizens of Vatican City. The most talented players were to be invited to join the Vatican Cricket Team, or \"the Vatican XI\". The Club plays its home matches at the Roma Capannelle Cricket Ground, home of Roma Capannelle CC, the only international cricket ground in Rome.\nThe team itself was established in June 2014, with the initial player list consisting of \"priests, deacons and seminarians\", primarily recruited from India. A small number of players from England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan were also included. The team is sponsored by the Pontifical Council for Culture.\nTour of England.\nThe Vatican Cricket Team will undertake their Fourth \"Light of Faith Tour\" in England over the summer of 2018. The team will play the first fixture of the tour against a specially-formed Stonyhurst College Gentlemen's XI from the famous Roman Catholic independent school. Founded in 1593, Stonyhurst College is an independent co-educational Catholic boarding and day school, occupying a magnificent Grade I listed building in Lancashire. Founded in 1593, it is the oldest Jesuit School in the world. The tour commencement at Stonyhurst acknowledges the school's long history of combining faith, academics and sporting excellence.\nThe team, made up of priests, deacons and seminarians studying and working in Rome and at the Vatican, will also play their first match at Lord's. Its opponents at Lord's will be an interfaith team, while other matches will include one against a Commonwealth of Nations XI, and against the British Royal Household Cricket Club at Windsor. The tour begins at Stonyhurst on 4 July 2018.\nThe team last toured England in September 2014, playing a team representing the Church of England and another representing the household of the British Royal Family. During a visit to Pakistan, representatives of the team met with Ishrat-ul-Ibad Khan who proposed a series of matches against his own \"Governor of Sindh's XI\" consisting of Islamic theology students.\nTour of Portugal.\nIn 2017, the team visited a cricket stadium in Miranda do Corvo for the 3rd official 'Light of Faith Tour', where the team was greeted at the stadium gates with a Fire Brigade Salute.

        "text": "Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. It was founded in 1782 and they play their home matches at the Nevill Ground. As of 2019 they play in the Kent Cricket League Premier Division.\nHistory.\nTunbridge Wells Cricket Club was founded in 1782. They first started playing cricket on the Higher Common Ground in Tunbridge Wells. In 1882, to commemorate their centenary, they played a match against Marylebone Cricket Club.\nIn 1895, Tunbridge Wells CC purchased a lease alongside Bluemantle's Cricket Club from William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny to establish a cricket ground. As a result, the Nevill Ground was established on a 99-year lease and named after the Marquess. In 1902, Kent County Cricket Club started playing annually at the Nevill Ground, which became Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week.\n1913 fire.\nIn 1913 the pavilion, including the club's archives, were destroyed in an arson attack by suffragettes, as part of a wider campaign to gain respect and votes for women. The choice of Tunbridge Wells Cricket Club as a target may have been provoked by a comment from a Kent official who was reported to have said prior to the attack: \"It is not true that women are banned from the pavilion. Who do you think makes the teas?\"\nThe arsonists left campaign literature and a photograph of activist Emmeline Pankhurst, to draw attention to her incarceration in Holloway Prison, and the practice of force-feeding her and others, when on hunger strikes. Cricket-loving Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle reacted angrily to the fire in a meeting of The National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage, dubbing the arsonists “female hooligans” and comparing the attack to “blowing up a blind man and his dog.” The pavilion was rebuilt within nine weeks, in time for the Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week, helped by a series of fund-raising concerts at Royal Tunbridge Wells' Opera House.\nRecent history.\nIn 1970 Tunbridge Wells CC were one of the founder members of the Kent Cricket League. Tunbridge Wells CC hosted a 1983 Cricket World Cup match between India and Zimbabwe where India's Kapil Dev scored 175 not out. They have won the Kent Cricket League three times, most recently in 1988. In 2004 Tunbridge Wells CC were granted by the England and Wales Cricket Board the ECB Clubmark. In 2016 Tunbridge Wells made it to the semi-final of the ECB National Club Twenty20. In 2021, they won the ECB National Club Twenty20 and as the T20 club champions of England, were invited to take part in the 2022 European Cricket League where they finished as runners-up."

        "text": "Charles Bricker Keller (born February 9, 1955) is a former first baseman, catcher and designated hitter in Minor League Baseball who played from 1976 through 1985 in the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays organizations. Listed at 6' 4\", 210 lb., Keller batted and threw right handed. He was born in Royal Oak, Michigan.\nThough he never played at the major league level, Keller played entirely at Triple-A – the classification directly below the major leagues – in seven of his 10 seasons and spent part of an eighth year there, as well. He hit over 200 home runs in his decade playing professional baseball.\nKeller was drafted by major league teams twice. He was initially taken by the Montreal Expos in the 20th round of the 1973 draft out of Seaholm High School in Birmingham, Michigan, but did not sign a contract. He did sign after being taken by the Braves in the 10th round of the 1976 MLB Draft out of Eastern Michigan University, where he earned All-Mid-American Conference honors in 1975 and 1976.\nIn his first professional season, 1976, Keller hit a combined .339 average with 11 home runs, 54 RBI, a .425 on-base percentage and a .571 slugging percentage in 62 games between two teams. He played for the Kingsport Braves, with whom he hit .362 with six home runs in 41 games, and the Greenwood Braves, with whom he hit .296 with five home runs in 21 games.\nKeller earned an invitation to major league spring training in 1977, to compete with Willie Montañez for the Braves' first base job. He did not make the big league club and was sent to Double-A. With the Savannah Braves in 1977, Keller hit .253 with 17 home runs and 86 RBI in 138 games to lead the Southern League in RBI. He tied Tom Chism and Al Javier for the league lead in home runs. Though he spent four games with the Triple-A Richmond Braves in 1978 – hitting .400 in 15 at-bats – he spent most of the year with Savannah, hitting .251 in 124 games. Overall, he hit .255 with 21 home runs and 77 RBI in 128 games that year.\nKeller joined Richmond again in 1979 and remained there until 1982. With the club in 1979, he hit .255 with 21 home runs and 75 RBI in 126 games to tie Sam Bowen with the International League lead in RBI. In 1980, he hit .197 with 20 home runs and 48 RBI in 117 games and in 1981, he hit .191 with 22 home runs and 60 RBI in 98 games. He hit .285 with 28 home runs, 93 RBI, a .402 on-base percentage and a .539 slugging percentage in 122 games during his final season with the team.\nUpon joining the Phillies organization as a free agent for 1983, Keller hit .273 with 28 home runs and 75 RBI in 119 games for the Triple-A Portland Beavers. His slugging percentage was .543. The Phillies signed him for 1984 and he hit .249 with 28 home runs and 82 RBI in 124 games for the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. That year, he led the International League in home runs and made the league's All-Star team. He returned to Syracuse in 1985, his final season, and hit .208 with seven home runs and 24 RBI in 69 games.\nIn between, Keller played winter ball with the Leones del Caracas and Tiburones de La Guaira clubs of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, playing for them in the 1979-80 and 1982-83 seasons, respectively.\nOverall, Keller hit .251 with 203 home runs, 674 RBI, 523 runs, 942 hits, 146 doubles, 16 triples, 11 stolen bases, 546 walks and 805 strikeouts in 3,757 at-bats over 1,103 career games. He slugged .460 and had a .347 on-base percentage. He hit at least 20 home runs a year from 1978 to 1984, a seven-year stretch."

        "text": "Barry Myers (September 11, 1938 - August 10, 2017) was an American former college baseball and men's soccer coach. He was the head baseball coach at both Jacksonville, from 1967 to 1973, and Mercer, from 1978 to 2003. At Jacksonville, he led the Dolphins to their first two NCAA tournaments, one each in the College and University Divisions. At Mercer, he won three TAAC Tournaments and was named TAAC Coach of the Year four times. A native West Virginian, Myers attended Marshall University, where he played baseball for the Thundering Herd under head coach Bill Chambers. He was also Mercer's soccer coach from 1974 to 1976, amassing a 12–21–3 overall record.\nCoaching career.\nBaseball.\nEarly career.\nAfter graduating from Marshall in 1960, Myers coached high school baseball in West Virginia for a few seasons. He began his college coaching career as a graduate assistant at Florida State in 1963. He then spent three seasons (1964–1966) at Miami-Dade Junior College as an assistant under Demie Mainieri. In 1964, Miami-Dade won the NJCAA National Championship.\nJacksonville.\nAhead of the 1967 season, Myers was hired as the head coach at Jacksonville, then a College Division school. Myers said of the hire, \"I think coaching at Jacksonville is going to be a tremendous challenge, but that's why I chose coaching as a profession, because of the challenge.\"\nIn his second season, Jacksonville had a 21–11–2 regular season to qualify for its first NCAA tournament. It went 1–2 in the District 3 Regional held in Fort Eustis, Virginia. It lost its opener to Long Island, defeated Belmont Abbey in an elimination game, and was then knocked out by Long Island. Myers was named the season's College Division District 3 Coach of the Year.\nJacksonville began playing in the large-school University Division in 1969. In 1972, it went 36–12 in the regular season to qualify for its first University Division tournament. At the District 3 Regional in Gastonia, North Carolina, the team went 0–2, losing games to Ole Miss and South Alabama.\nDuring Myers's tenure, Jacksonville had three All-America selections and four MLB Draft selections. Tom McMillan, a second-round selection of the Cleveland Indians in 1973, later played in Major League Baseball.\nMercer.\nMyers left Jacksonville to become an assistant at Mercer from 1974 to 1977. He was promoted to head coach to replace Claude Smith. He was Mercer's head coach from 1978 to 2003 and had an overall record of 663–677–5.\nAfter going 32–16 in Myers' first season, 1978, Mercer joined the newly formed Trans America Athletic Conference. In its first five seasons in the league, 1979 to 1983, it had four 30-win seasons and won three TAAC Tournaments. Myers was named TAAC Coach of the Year in each of the tournament-winning seasons. The team returned to the TAAC Tournament in 1984. The Bears won three of the first four TAAC Player of the Year awards, including Craig Gibson's in 1985.\nMercer struggled from 1986 to 1993. It had three winning seasons but no winning seasons in the TAAC. In 1994, however, Myers was named Coach of the Year for the fourth time as the team won West Division and played in the conference tournament. The Bears won their division again in 1997 and appeared in another conference tournament in 1999.\nMyers retired after the 2003 season. He was replaced by Gibson, who had been an assistant from 1987 to 1988 and 1994 to 2003.\nDuring his tenure, Mercer had 13 MLB Draft selections, including a high of three in both the 1983 and 1990 drafts. One former player, Mike Mimbs, went on to play in Major League Baseball.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a table of Myers's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach."

Voting for the honor was conducted by the head coaches of each member team once the tournament has completed and any player regardless of their team's finish is eligible.\nThe All-Tournament Team began being awarded after the first championship in 1948 along with an All-Tournament Second-Team. The second team was dropped after the 1969 tournament and it has remained a single team ever since except for 1976 when no team was selected. In recent years the regional tournaments have begun to name all-tournament teams of their own, making the NCAA All-Tournament team draw only from the teams and performances in the Frozen Four.\nIn two years (1973 and 1992) some players who were voted onto the All-Tournament team played for schools that had their participation in the championship vacated and are no longer officially recognized with the honor but have been included here for historical reference.

Members of the Heavyweight bracket each host at least one member of the Middleweight bracket on campus before the tournament. Since the Middleweight bracket's dissolution in 2021, the tournament continues to find opponents for members of the formerly named Heavyweight bracket to host on campus that would have played in the Middleweight bracket.\nWhile the Heavyweight bracket pool always features four teams, the Middleweight bracket pool's size is variable, ranging from as little as two teams to as many as five. Despite this, only up to four teams in the Middleweight bracket pool played in Las Vegas. Since 2021, two teams that would have played in the Middleweight bracket each play two Heavyweight opponents before facing each other on campus.\nBrackets.\n2022 - Continental Tire Main Event.\nCampus Game Contender(s): Norfolk State beat Monmouth 64-59\n2021 - Roman Main Event.\nCampus Game Contender(s): North Dakota State beat Tarleton State 54-53\n2020 - Men's Vegas Bubble.\nThe event had a unique format due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

The team's head coach was Johnny Jones, who was in his third season at LSU. They played their home games at Pete Maravich Assembly Center as members of the Southeastern Conference. They finished the season 22–11, 11–7 in SEC play to finish in a four-way tie for third place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the SEC tournament to Auburn. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament where they lost in the second round to NC State.\nPrevious season and offseason.\nLSU completed the 2013–14 season with an overall record of 20–14 and a 9–9 record in Southeastern Conference play. After receiving a bye for the first round of the SEC tournament, the Tigers defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide in the second round. They were eliminated by the Kentucky Wildcats in the quarterfinals. They were invited to the National Invitation Tournament where they defeated San Francisco in the first round. They were eliminated by SMU in the second round.\nThe Tigers lost several key players following the end of the season. Andre Stringer, the team's leading three-point shooter, completed his senior season. Junior forward Johnny O'Bryant III, the team leader in scoring and rebounding, elected to forgo his senior season and enter the 2014 NBA draft, where he was selected in the second round by the Milwaukee Bucks. In a somewhat surprising move, LSU chose not to renew the scholarship of point guard Anthony Hickey, who led the team in assists and steals, for the 2014–15 season. Hickey transferred to Oklahoma State, where he received a waiver from the NCAA to allow him to play immediately.\nKeith Hornsby, who transferred to LSU from UNC Asheville and was required to sit out the prior season, will be eligible to play beginning with the 2014–15 season. The Tigers also signed a strong recruiting class, which included Elbert Robinson, one of the top-rated centers in the country, and Josh Gray, a junior college transfer at guard who led the NJCAA in scoring in 2013-2014 with 34.7 points per game.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B; color:#FDD023;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B; color:#FDD023;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B; color:#FDD023;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B;\"| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#33297B;\"| NCAA tournament\nSource:\nSee also.\n2014–15 LSU Lady Tigers basketball team"

McCaffery, who thought Moore was already recruited, came down to watch him play (with Moore collecting 15 assists in that game) and sent him a scholarship offer soon after.\nCollege career.\nMoore debuted against Stanford on 11 November 2006, posting 10 points, 3 assists, and 3 steals off the bench.\nHe started 27 games over his freshman season, leading the Saints in minutes (31.2 minutes) and assists (4.9, third-best in the MAAC), adding 7.4 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.\nHe posted a MAAC-third best 5.3 assists per game in his sophomore season, adding 4.1 rebounds and 1.5 steals in nearly 32 minutes per game.\nMoore contributed 11 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists in the NCAA tournament upset of Vanderbilt.\nHe led the MAAC in assists for his junior year, with 6.4 per game (twelfth best nationally) on his way to Second Team All-MAAC and All-MAAC Tournament Team selections.\nTwo three-pointers in the NCAA tournament game against Ohio State, the first to tie the game in the first overtime and the second to win the game with 3.9 seconds left in the second overtime, allowed Siena to progress to the Second Round.\nHe proceeded to have \"one of the best 1-for-10 shooting performances\", posting 10 assists for 2 turnovers as he evaded Louisville's press, though that was not enough to topple the No. 1-seed.\nAs a senior in 2009–2010, Moore was a First-team All-MAAC selection.\nHe had 9 points and 6 assists against Fairfield in the MAAC tournament final to help Siena win the tournament for the third consecutive year.\nMoore led the entire NCAA Division I in assists during the season with 261 assists (7.7 per game), he finished his career with an MAAC record 823 that also ranked 23rd all-time best in the Division I.\nProfessional career.\nGoing undrafted in the 2010 NBA draft, Moore signed his first professional contract for Slovak Extraliga side Edymax SPU Nitra over the summer, averaging 17 points and 7 assists during the 2010–11 season.\nThe next season saw Moore move to PGE Turów Zgorzelec of the Polish Basketball League. \nHe had 7.2 points and 4.4 assists a little more than 22 minutes per game in the Polish league, complemented by 9.8 points and 5.2 assists in nearly 26 minutes in Europe's second-tier Eurocup.\nIn September 2012, the American moved to Alba Fehérvár of the Hungarian NB I/A, helping the side win the league and cup with 11.5 points, 6.3 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game.\nOn 2 July 2013, he signed with Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague outfit Cherkaski Mavpy.\nHowever, he left the team in February 2014 due to the unrest in the country.\nHe joined Italian Serie A side Pasta Reggia Caserta on 25 February 2014 to finish the season.\nDuring the summer, his contract was renewed for the 2014–15 season.\nOn 10 August 2015, Moore signed with fellow Serie A side Giorgio Tesi Group Pistoia.\nOn June 26, 2018, Moore left Pistoia after 3 years and signed a deal with Pallacanestro Varese.\nOn July 30, 2019, he has signed with Élan Béarnais of the French LNB Pro A. He averaged 9.5 points, 3 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game. On August 2, 2020, Moore has signed for Cibona of the ABA League.\nIn December, 2020, he moved to Debreceni EAC of the Hungarian Basketball League.\nPersonal.\nThree members of Moore's family have also been involved in the sport at a high level.

        "title": "List of Antarctic cycling expeditions",
        "text": "Antarctic cycling expeditions were made possible with the development of fatbikes: fat tired bicycles designed for riding in snow and sand.\nExpeditions.\nExpeditions in descending order of distance cycled.\nDoug Stoup was the first person to undertake a cycling expedition in Antarctica. In January 2003 he rode on a specially designed \"ice bike\" around the Patriot Hills.\nIn 2012, Helen Skelton became the first person to reach the South Pole using a bicycle. The bike was custom built for her trip with 8-inch-wide (20 cm) tires. She also used skis and a kite to help her pull a sled containing of supplies. She covered by kite ski, by bike and by cross-country ski. Some of Skelton's claims have been challenged.\nIn December 2012, Eric Larsen made the first attempt to undertake an expedition solely by bicycle to the South Pole. After covering , a quarter of the distance to the South Pole, Larsen abandoned his attempt and cycled an additional back to Patriot Hills. \nOn 27 December 2013, Maria Leijerstam became the first person to cycle from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole. Her journey commenced from near McMurdo Station on the Ross Ice Shelf and accessed the Polar Plateau via the Leverett Glacier. Maria also established the human-powered speed record of 10 days, 14 hours, and 56 minutes \nJuan Menéndez Granados, calling himself \"Juan Sin Miedo\", started his bicycle and ski expedition at Hercules Inlet in December 2013 and finished on January 17, 2014. He traveled the full distance without being resupplied, surviving the last 4 days of the expedition drinking chocolate powder and sunflower oil. When it was not possible to progress by cycling, he used skis to make progress. He became the first person to cycle to the South Pole solo, unsupported and unassisted.\nDaniel Burton attempted a solo cycling expedition to the South Pole later in 2014, although there were four caches of food staged along the route, as well as an equipment cache. Burton traveled the full distance pedaling or pushing his bike (without skis such as Menéndez used). His effort took 5 days longer than Menéndez'.\nIn 2026-17, Keith Tuffley became the first person to cycle a new route to the South Pole. He cycled from the coast of Antarctica on the Ross Ice Shelf to the top of the Reedy Glacier and through the Trans-Antarctic Mountains - this was first ever traverse of the Reedy Glacier. For the first 21 days of the expedition (distance of 377km, to an altitude of 2,846m), 81% of the distance was completed on the bike and 19% on skis. For the remaining 13 days (244km) to the South Pole, the majority was on skis. In total, he traveled 621km, 51% of which was completed by bike (315km), 49% on skis. The expedition was unsupported and unassisted (no food drops, no access to a compacted ice road or to vehicle tracks). He completed the expedition together with polar guide Eric Phillips and Robert Smith who were both on skis.\nOmar Di Felice attempted a solo cycling expedition to the South Pole first in November 2022 but it was forced to come back home after a week due to family problem. After winning the Trans Am Bike Race in June 2023, he decided to come back trying to reach the South Pole starting from Hercules Inlet in November 2023. He started on November 20th and after 48 days of riding he was forced to stop and cycle back to be picked up in Thiels Corner (85°05' South on the Hercules Inlet - South Pole track). His attempt called \"Antarctica Unlimited\" is also part of the project \"Bike to 1.5°C\" to raise awareness on climate change. The distance he covered is the second longest ever cycled in Antarctica "

        "text": "The men's 10,000 metres at the 1978 European Athletics Championships was held in Prague, then Czechoslovakia, at Stadion Evžena Rošického on 29 August 1978.\nResults.\nFinal.\n29 August\nThis 10,000-metre race was characterized by a fairly quick and steady pace, and by the rather frequent changes of the main group's leader. Romania's Paul Copu led the field through 1,000 metres in 2:43.8, and through 2,000 metres in 5:26.2. Under 100 metres later, he let his teammate Ilie Floroiu pass him. Copu deliberately dropped to the last place, and he retired from the race at 2,400 metres. Over 300 metres later, Britain's Brendan Foster took the lead for the first time. During the next several laps, Foster and Floroiu sometimes alternated in the lead. The pace slowed down slightly, with 3,000 metres being clocked in 8:12.0, and with 4,000 metres taking the leader 10:58.3. By the time the main group's leader passed 5,000 metres in 13:44.8, ten runners had lost contact with the leading group, but thirteen runners still were able to endure the steady and quite fast pace. Before 6,000 metres, the Soviet Union's Alexander Antipov moved to the lead, and he passed that split point in 16:32.7. At that point, eleven runners still remained in the main group. After 6,900 metres, Jos Hermens of the Netherlands was forced to drop out of the race, due to a serious leg injury. Around 7,000 metres, at which point the official split time was 19:20.6, the Soviet Union's Enn Sellik began to have trouble following the leading group, due to a stinging pain in his liver. However, he never fully lost contact with the leaders, and during the eighth kilometre, he overcame his physical discomfort. Floroiu still led the main group through 8,000 metres in 22:08.8. About one lap later, Britain's David Black moved into the lead. Around 8,500 metres, Poland's Jerzy Kowol at last was forced to drop from the leading group. After 8,800 metres, Sellik and Norway's Knut Kvalheim also lost touch with the main group, and a moment later they were joined by the Netherlands' Gerard Tebroke, who could not keep up with Black's sudden and sharp surge of pace. At 9,000 metres, Black led the field in 24:54.4, with Foster closely following him. Several metres behind were running Floroiu, Ortis, Antipov, and Vainio. On the far bend, Vainio rose to the third place, and was able to catch Black and Foster. The leading trio of runners caught East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski by one lap. Around 9,300 metres, the exhausted Floroiu fell behind the main group, while Ortis and Antipov joined the three leading runners early on the back straight. Shortly before the final lap started, Foster passed Black. On the last lap's front bend, Ortis passed Antipov, and a moment later, Vainio accelerated past Black. With slightly over 300 metres left, Ortis surprisingly surged into the lead. Black lost contact with the leading group early on the final back straight, but Foster kicked past Ortis into the lead. At the start of the final bend, Vainio accelerated past Ortis, and with under 130 metres left, he easily passed Foster. By the start of the homestretch, also Ortis kicked past the exhausted Foster. Antipov, who had dropped several metres behind the top three runners on the final bend, kicked furiously on the homestretch, and he caught Foster with around 30 metres to go. Amazingly, the tired British runner soon gave up the struggle for the bronze medal, and he jogged across the finish line in the fourth place. By contrast, Antipov almost passed Ortis, who could only secure the silver medal by leaning across the finish line. Vainio set a new European Championships and Finnish record at 27:31.0 - nearly 30 seconds faster than he had ever run 10,000 metres before.

In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play.\nUSA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 32 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 800.\nSee also.\n2014–15 NCAA Division I women's basketball rankings"

        "text": "Mike Dee (born May 20, 1958) is an American former baseball coach and outfielder. He played college baseball at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse. He served as the head baseball coach at the UIC Flames (1999–2021). Under him, UIC reached six NCAA tournaments. Before coming to UIC, he was an assistant at Minnesota.\nPlaying career.\nDee was raised near Chicago before moving to Wisconsin for his senior year of high school. He played high school baseball at Benet Academy in Lisle, Illinois for three years and at Aquinas High School in La Crosse, Wisconsin for one. He attended the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse, where he played three seasons of baseball for the Indians. In 1979, Dee's senior season, the team reached the NAIA World Series.\nCoaching career.\nDee first coached high school baseball at Aquinas for six seasons from 1982 to 1987. The school won the Wisconsin State Title four straight times from 1984 to 1987. In 1987, Dee was named the Wisconsin State High School Coach of the Year and the Wisconsin Baseball Coaches Association Coach (WBCA) of the Year.\nMinnesota.\nDee's first college coaching job came at Minnesota, where he was an assistant under John Anderson from 1988 to 1998. During his tenure, the Golden Gophers reached six NCAA tournaments and never won fewer than 30 games. Dee was named the WBCA Man of the Year in 1996.\nUIC.\nAhead of the 1999 season, Dee replaced Dean Refakes as the head coach at UIC.\nAfter a losing record in 1999, UIC began the most successful stretch in program history from 2000 to 2008. In the stretch, the Flames had nine 30-win seasons and won eight Horizon League regular season titles and four Horizon League Tournaments.\nUIC made its first NCAA tournament in 2003, then reached the postseason again in 2005, 2007, and 2008. The team went 0–2 in 2003 and 2005 but won a game in both 2007 and 2008. In 2007, as the fourth seed in the Long Beach Regional, it upset top-seeded Long Beach State. In 2008, as the fourth seed in the College Station Regional, it defeated second seeded Dallas Baptist in an elimination game. UIC extended Dee's contract after the 2008 season.\nIn November 2006, Dee was seriously injured in a practice accident. A player doing a bat release drill accidentally let go of a bat that flew and hit Dee in the face. His orbital, cheekbone, and nose were shattered. Doctors restored his face with major reconstructive surgery and metal implants, and he kept sight in both eyes. He was able to coach the start of the following 2007 season, though he needed a mask and dugout heaters to protect the healing bones from the cold.\nDee has won the Horizon League Coach of the Year award eight times: 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. During his tenure, UIC has had two league Players of the Year, three Pitchers of the Year, and seven Newcomers of the Year.\nSix Flames have been taken in the MLB Draft from 1999 to 2014. Future Major Leaguer Curtis Granderson played for the program early in Dee's tenure and was one of the Flames' conference Players of the Year. In 2014, following a $5 million donation from Granderson to rebuild the stadium, UIC's home field was renamed Les Miller Field at Curtis Granderson Stadium.\nOn June 15, 2021, UIC announced Mike Dee's retirement. On September 8, Dee, serving as athletic director of Aquinas High School, announced he would also serve as the head coach of the baseball team.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a table of Dee's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach."

The silver medal went to Germany's Lisa Brennauer – the world time trial champion – having narrowly been beaten by Ferrand-Prévot in a photo finish, while Emma Johansson of Sweden won the bronze medal. Vos could only finish tenth in the race – the first time since the 2005 Championships that Vos had not won a medal – after her attack on the final climb (along with Johansson, Lizzie Armitstead and Elisa Longo Borghini) was negated in the closing kilometres, which led to a regrouping of 15 riders prior to the final sprint.\nQualification.\nQualification was based mainly on the 2014 UCI Nation Ranking as of 15 August 2014. The first five nations in this classification qualified seven riders to start, the next ten nations qualified six riders to start and the next five nations qualified five riders to start. Other nations and non ranked nations had the possibility to send three riders to start.\nMoreover, the outgoing World Champion and continental champions were also able to take part in the race on top of the nation numbers.\nCourse.\nThe race was held on the same circuit as the other road races and consisted of seven laps.

        "title": "Polish Rugby Union",
        "text": "Polish Rugby Union (Polish: \"Polski Związek Rugby\"), abbreviated to PZR, is the only legal Polish representative of Polish rugby union and rugby sevens for both men and women's rugby and all age groups.\nHistory.\nThe Polish Rugby Union (Polski Związek Rugby) was founded in 1957, although rugby had already existed in Poland since the 1920s, when in 1921, Louis Amblard, a Frenchman, set up the very first Polish rugby club called \"The White Eagles\". The first match was in 1922, and the first club international in 1924 against a Romanian side. There was, however, an earlier Polish Rugby Union set up in the early 1920s, but disbanded in 1928, as the sport failed to gain much popularity and historical disruptions such as World War II and Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact halted development, which why it was not until the 1950s that the sport re-emerged. Poland's first ever rugby season was in 1956 between September and December. There was no national league but only 5 regional divisions which were meant to determine who shall play in the top flight which was to be established later on. PZR joined the IRFB in 1988.\nThe official supplier of equipment to the PRU is O'Brien sport.\nIn 1921, Louis Amblard, a Frenchman, set up the very first Polish rugby club called \"The White Eagles\". The first match was in 1922, and the first club international in 1924 against a Romanian side.\nThe game became established in the Warsaw Military Academy in the early 1930s.\nThe tragic events of World War II, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact etc., meant that the growth of Polish rugby was retarded until the 1950s. During World War II, there were occasional games between allied POWs in German camps in Poland. For example, a game was held between a Scottish and a Welsh XV, in ten inches of snow. No conversions were allowed, as the ball would have gone over the camp fence, and the game was twenty minutes each way. Players wore army boots, trousers, prison shirts and balaclavas.\nPolish rugby arguably achieved its greatest success in the late 1970s when the national team beat Italy, Spain and the USSR, and also held Romania to a 37–21 win in 1977.\nIn 1983, Poland failed to play in the FIRA Championships, and told FIRA that two of their players had died. It is not known where the other died, but one had died near Bucharest.\nThe Cold War frequently intruded – for example in the 1984 FIRA Championships, in the game against France, Poland demanded the removal of the French players Didier Camberabero, Henri Sanz and the Brive RFC centre Yves Fouget, because as members of the French armed forces, they were considered to be a security risk.\nBecause of high Polish emigration, particularly to France, and English speaking nations, the Polish team actually has a fairly large pool of potential players. In addition,\na number of Poles returning from jobs in the British Isles and France, have carried the game back with them.\nThere are currently three divisions in Poland. The second division was relaunched in 2009 using some of the major teams providing 2nd XVs, along with some newly formed sides. The top division has 8 teams while the second division has 6 teams. Prior to that in 2008/2009 there were 10 teams in the top division and only 4 in the second. This led to some very uneven contests between the top teams and those at the bottom of the league. There is now also a regional league played in the centre of Poland (around Lodz and Warsaw) in which some smaller clubs have entered teams and second teams from some of the top clubs nationally compete.\nPolish rugby development, however, has tended to concentrate on rugby sevens as a means of introducing the sport to people. The PRU organises regular one day sevens tournaments over the spring/summer with teams travelling from all over the country. There are teams forming all over the country, but there is a shortage of quality coaching and basic equipment. Despite this rugby is making good headway.\nRugby tens also has some popularity.\nInternational.\nThe PZR governs currently several senior Polish rugby teams. The most notable is the Poland national rugby union team, however there is also a Poland women's national rugby union team. There are also both men's and women's rugby sevens national teams.\nPoland's international debut was in 1958 against , and they won the match 9–8.\nThey compete in the second division competition Rugby Europe Trophy, where the winner is promoted to the Premier Division Rugby Europe Championship. In 2018, Poland competed against Portugal, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Maldova.\nIn 2018, the Polish XV Men's team was ranked 35 in the world. They also compete in the VII's Europe Grand Prix 7s Series.\nWomen's Polish Rugby compete in the Women's 7s GPS, where they play other European countries, such as Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy, France, Russia and Germany\nMen's Rugby.\nThe PZR governs the 3 domestic national divisions. The second division was relaunched in 2009 using some of the major teams providing 2nd XVs, along with some newly formed sides. The top division has 8 teams while the second division has 6 teams. Prior to that in 2008/2009 there were 10 teams in the top division and only 4 in the second. This led to some very uneven contests between the top teams and those at the bottom of the league. There are now also regional leagues in which some smaller clubs have entered teams and second teams from some of the top clubs which compete nationally.\nThe current league system has been in place since 2011/2012.\nXV Rugby.\nTier 1 – Extraliga.\nRugby Ekstraliga\nTeams \nTier 2 – Liga I.\nI liga\nTeams\nTier 3 – Liga II.\nII liga Rugby Teams\nSeven's Rugby.\nPolish rugby development, has tended to concentrate on rugby sevens as a means of introducing the sport to people.

        "title": "Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League",
        "text": "The Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League (MCVL) is an intercollegiate men's volleyball conference associated with the NCAA's Division III.\nHistory.\nThe MCVL was founded in March 2014 by an amicable split of the Continental Volleyball Conference (CVC), which itself had only been created in 2011. The CVC's six Midwestern schools, which had previously formed a CVC division, wished to create a more geographically compact league. The two groups agreed that the CVC's eastern teams would retain the CVC name and branding. Since the CVC retained six members, that group also retained its automatic berth in the Division III national championship. It was also agreed that two Midwestern schools that were adding the sport for 2014–15 (2015 season) and had been announced as incoming CVC members, Benedictine University and Loras College, would instead join the new Midwestern league. The next month, the new league was unveiled as the MCVL.\nIn September 2014, two Illinois schools that were adding volleyball in the 2015–16 school year (2016 season), Greenville College (now Greenville University) and North Central College, were accepted as the league's 9th and 10th members. Three months later, four additional schools—Adrian College, Marian University of Wisconsin, Olivet College, and Wittenberg University—were announced as new members for 2015–16.\nThe MCVL was not eligible for an automatic berth in the Division III national championship in its first two seasons (2015 and 2016); during that time, its teams were eligible for at-large berths.\nIn January 2017, the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC), the all-sports home of five MCVL members—charter members Benedictine, Dominican University of Illinois, Lakeland College of Wisconsin (now Lakeland University) and the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), plus 2015 arrival Marian—announced that it would begin sponsoring men's volleyball in the 2018 season. This followed previous announcements that NACC members Aurora University and Concordia University Wisconsin would launch varsity men's volleyball in that season, giving the NACC seven men's volleyball schools and an automatic berth in the Division III national championship. As a result, the MCVL initially dropped to nine members for the 2018 season. Before that season, the MCVL returned to 10 members with the addition of Augustana College of Illinois, which was set to begin sponsoring varsity men's volleyball in the 2018 season. Augustana had intended to begin varsity play as an independent with a view toward eventually gaining MCVL membership, but was immediately accepted into the league.\nAfter the 2018 season, the MCVL lost one member and gained another. Wittenberg left to become a single-sport affiliate in the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference, while Trine University resurrected a varsity program that last played in 2002 and joined the MCVL.\nThe MCVL lost half of its 2019 membership when the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) added men's volleyball for the 2020 season. Augustana, Carthage, Greenville, Loras, and North Central, along with new programs at North Park and Millikin, began CCIW conference play in 2020. Greenville and Loras were accepted into the CCIW as associate members. This temporarily left the MCVL in danger of eventually losing its automatic bid to the NCAA championship, but the league restored its membership to the six needed to maintain its automatic bid by adding the University of Mount Union, which had spent its inaugural men's volleyball season of 2019 as an independent, for the 2020 season.\nThree schools became members in advance of the 2021 season. Wittenberg returned to the MCVL after a two-year absence, and the league added the new varsity programs of Baldwin Wallace University and Wabash College.\nThe league's most recent expansion took place after the 2023 season with the arrival of Calvin University, which started a new varsity men's volleyball program. When the MCVL announced Calvin's arrival, it announced a two-year moratorium on the addition of any further members.\nCurrent members.\nThe league was founded with eight members. Six joined for the 2016 season, five left after the 2017 season, and one joined for the 2018 season. The 2019 season saw the conference membership remain at 10, with one departing member replaced by a new school. After the 2019 season five teams left and Mount Union was added, dropping the league to six members for the 2020 season. The league returned to nine members for the 2021 season with the return of Wittenberg and the addition of new programs at Baldwin Wallace and Wabash, and returned to 10 for the 2024 season with the addition of another new program at Calvin. All current and former conference members are private institutions.\nThe conference formed Eastern and Western Divisions for the 2017 season, but reverted to a single-table format following the departure of the five NACC members.\nNote that because NCAA men's volleyball is a spring sport, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first year of competition, and the year of departure for former members coincides with the final season of MCVL competition.\nFormer members.\nSchool names and nicknames reflect those used in the final season of MCVL membership.\nMembership timeline.\nAs noted previously, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of competition."

        "text": "Thomas Edward Jordan (born May 23, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player, whose club career spanned from 1988 to 2003.\nEarly life.\nJordan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and attended Lake Clifton High School, where he played for the high school basketball team, averaging 22.0 points and 12.7 rebounds per game during his senior year. He was once ranked the top-rated high school basketball player in the Baltimore area.\nIn 1987, during his senior year in high school, Jordan infamously walked out in the middle of the \"Metro Classic Championship\" game between Lake Clifton, and St. Maria Goretti High School at the Baltimore Arena; Jordan was upset, because his teammates were not passing him the ball. He was taken out of the game with several minutes left in the second quarter, and with his team trailing at halftime, 38–28, he went into the locker room, got dressed into his street clothes, and left the arena to go home. Without Jordan in the second half, Lake Clifton lost the championship game, 73–72, as Rodney Monroe of St. Maria Goretti made a 60-foot shot at the buzzer.\nCollege career.\nJordan played college basketball at Oklahoma State University; he was ineligible as a freshman in the 1987–88 season, due to low test scores, and failing to qualify under NCAA Proposition 48 guidelines. In his sophomore year, he averaged 13.8 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game, while shooting .586 in field-goal percentage for the Cowboys during the 1988–89 season. Jordan's decision to leave college early to play professionally was due to a lack of team chemistry.\nJordan said that he never \"enjoyed\" basketball, he only \"played it.\" He used the sport as a means to get a free college education, and any desires of playing professionally was not necessarily his goal. In October 1988, Jordan told \"The Oklahoman\" newspaper:\n\"I don't like basketball; I just play it. It's a vehicle for a free ride (college scholarship). If the air blew up the ball, I'm not going to cry. Don't get me wrong, I won't turn down a pro career if that comes, but I'm not counting on it.\"\nProfessional career.\nAfter his sophomore year of college, Jordan began a pro club career. He played professionally for 14 years, in six countries, which included time spent playing in the National Basketball Association. In April 1993, Jordan was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia 76ers, who signed him to a 10-day contract; he played in the final four games of the 1992–93 NBA season, averaging 11.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game off the bench as the team's sixth man.\nJordan was also a free agent in the Minnesota Timberwolves' training camp prior to the 1993–94 NBA season, but did not play for them. In the 1994 off-season, he played for the New York Knicks in the \"Doral Arrowwood Summer League\", before returning to play overseas until his retirement in 2003.\nPersonal life.\nJordan has a younger brother named Alexander Mobley, who also played basketball; Mobley attended Dunbar High School in Washington D.C., and played college basketball at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore."

She both threw and batted right-handed in outfield, and utility infield positions.\nEarly life and family.\nWaddell was born in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania. She had five older brothers, who she claimed, \"beat the hell out of [her],\" toughening her up which helped her with her baseball. She married Neil Wyatt in 1951. They were married for 53 years and had two sons.\nBaseball career.\nAfter trying out for the AAGPBL in 1949, she was assigned to spring training for the South Bend Blue Sox. She never played for South Bend, being traded to the Rockford Peaches just before the start of the 1950 season. Waddell played with the Springfield Sallies (1949), the Rockford Peaches (1950, 1951) and the Battle Creek Belles (1951). When she played for the Rockford Peaches, the team was managed by Bill Allington. She played second base for the Peaches when they won the All-American Girls Professional Baseball title in 1951."

Soon thereafter, West Germany's Christoph Herle took the lead. His teammate Frank Zimmermann passed Herle before 1,600 metres. Zimmermann led the leading group at 2,000 metres in 5:28.1. Finland's Martti Vainio, who had stunned many long-distance running fans on the opening day by winning the 10,000-metre race, shared the lead with West Germany's Frank Zimmermann. Only Portugal's Fernando Mamede, a talented but notably nervous runner, lost contact with the main group already soon after 1,500 metres. Before 3,000 metres, Britain's Nick Rose surged into the lead, dropping West Germany's Christoph Herle, and reaching 3,000 metres in 8:09.5. During the next kilometre, despite the rather slow pace, also West Germany's Karl Fleschen and Frank Zimmermann, East Germany's Jörg Peter, Belgium's Léon Schots, the Soviet Union's Boris Kuznetsov, and his team mate Enn Sellik dropped from the lead group. Vainio was leading at 4,000 metres in 10:53.3. He was followed by Rose, Romania's Ilie Floroiu, Italy's Venanzio Ortis, the Soviet Union's Aleksandr Fyodotkin, Switzerland's Markus Ryffel, and Ireland's John Treacy. Sellik tried to catch the leading group, but could not. At 4,600 metres, reached in about 12:30–12:31, the seven-runner leading group was still tightly together. Around 4,700 metres, Floroiu suddenly rushed past Vainio who could, however, still increase his pace. Rose started to drop from the lead group, and for a few crucial seconds, Treacy lingered behind him. Vainio managed to keep his lead until the second half of the final bend, when Ryffel, Ortis, and Fyodotkin sprinted past him. During the first half of the home straight, also Floroiu and Treacy managed to pass Vainio. While Ortis narrowly but decisively passed Ryffel and Fyodotkin, Treacy kicked past Floroiu, and kept closing in on the three leading runners. Despite his narrow victory, Ortis raised his arms in triumph, while Fyodotkin and Ryffel crossed the finish line so tied that even the finish-line camera could not separate them. This was a very tight finish for a major championship final; the first four runners crossed the line 0.31 seconds apart, the first five runners in 0.8 seconds, and the first six runners in 1.2 seconds.\nHeats.\n31 August\nParticipation.\nAccording to an unofficial count, 32 athletes from 21 countries participated in the event."

The ACC Asian XI played their first in a one-off match the 2005 World Cricket Tsunami Appeal which was designed to raise funds for charities following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and resulting tsunami. As of now, Asia XI had played 7 matches, the Asian XI have won 4 of them.\nThe team also competed in an Afro-Asia Cup against an Africa XI which was designed as a fund-raiser for the African Cricket Association and the Asian Cricket Council. The Afro-Asian Cup debuted in 2005 and the second tournament was played in 2007.\nHistory.\n1999/00 ICC Cricket Week.\nAsia XI and Rest of the world XI played a one Match series on 8 April 2000 as a part of 1999/00 ICC Cricket Week.\nTsunami Appeal Match.\nTheir first match resulted in a heavy 112 run loss to the World XI in the Tsunami Appeal match at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Travelex sponsored the first match, which was a 78,000 sell-out, for A$1 million. Two C-130H Hercules aircraft, similar to those used by the Royal Australian Air Force to carry supplies to regions devastated by the massive earthquake and resulting tsunamis, flew over the MCG during the break between innings.\nThe first ODI, which the World XI won by 112 runs, raised approximately A$17 million, while original estimations suggested only A$5 million would be raised from the Australians. The games were designated as One Day Internationals by the ICC, the first time a game between teams not representing separate cricketing nations was so designated. This designation attracted criticism from cricket statisticians.\n2005 Afro-Asia Cup.\nAfro-Asia Cup was an idea to raise money for the Asian Cricket Council and the African Cricket Association and the whole venture was given a massive boost when the ICC somewhat controversially agreed to give the series of one-day matches full ODI status.\nThey went on to lose the opening match of the 2005 Afro-Asian Cup by two runs to the African XI. They bounced back and won the next match, however, including half centuries for each of the Sri Lankan pair Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. During the deciding match, the Asian XI bowled the African XI out for 106, but soon after starting their batting performance rain fell and the game was called off: the trophy was shared.\n2007 Afro-Asia Cup.\nIn the 2007 competition, the Asian XI recorded a 3–0 whitewash of the Africans – winning the first two matches by 34 and 31 runs (respectively), the latter helped by Dilhara Fernando recording ODI career best bowling figures of 4/36. In the final match, the Asians fell to 72/5, but following centuries from Mahela Jayawardene (107) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (139*) – the latter being the highest individual score ever recorded in an Afro-Asia Cup match – they posted a score of 331/8. Despite half-centuries from three of the African batsmen, however, the Asian XI won by 13 runs.\nMahela Jayawardene is the highest run-scorer of the Asian XI in the Afro-Asia Cup, with two half-centuries and a century to his name, second to Shaun Pollock, and was named Man of the Series for the 2007 competition. Zaheer Khan tops the list for most wickets with 11."

        "text": "The men's sprint was a cycling event held at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico, held on 18 to 19 October 1968. There were 47 participants from 28 nations. Each nation was limited to two cyclists. The event was won by Daniel Morelon of France, his second consecutive medal and first gold; it was also France's world-leading sixth victory in the men's sprint. His countryman Pierre Trentin, who had lost the bronze medal match to Morelon four years earlier, this year won it against Omar Pkhakadze of the Soviet Union. Between the French cyclists was silver medalist Giordano Turrini of Italy, extending that nation's streak of top-two results in the event to six Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. The only two quarterfinalists from 1964 to return were the French cyclists: Pierre Trentin and Daniel Morelon. Trentin had been favored in 1964, but both had lost in the semifinals and Morelon had won the bronze medal match between them. Morelon would beat Trentin again at the 1966 and 1967 World Championship finals and the 1968 Grand Prix de Paris, though Trentin would prevail in the 1964, 1965, and 1967 Grand Prix competitions. Coming into Mexico City, Morelon was favored with Trentin expected to challenge him in the final. Also contending were 1965 World Champion Omar Phakadze of the Soviet Union and runner-up Giordano Turrini of Italy, as well as 1968 runner-up Niels Fredborg of Denmark.\nBarbados, Belize, Lebanon, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and Thailand each made their debut in the men's sprint; West Germany competed separately for the first time. France made its 14th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches. The 1968 competition involved ten rounds: six main rounds (first round, second round, 1/8 finals, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) as well as three repechages after the first three main rounds; the third repechage was a two-round repechage.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nJan Jansen matched the Olympic record at 11.10 seconds for the last 200 metres in the eighth heat of round 1. Dino Verzini set a new record of 10.87 seconds in the next heat. Roger Gibbon pushed the record to 10.70 seconds in the fifth heat of round 2. Leijn Loevesijn's time of 10.66 seconds in the second heat of the third repechage semifinals was the last record-breaking performance of the event.\nResults.\nFirst round.\nFirst round heat 5.\nJürgen Kissner of West Germany was entered in this heat but did not compete.\nFirst round heat 7.\nGeorge Artin of Iraq was entered in this heat but did not compete.\nFirst round heat 8.\nConstantin Kabemba of the Cook Islands was entered in this heat but did not compete.\nFirst round heat 13.\nIgnace Mandjambi of the Cook Islands was entered in this heat but did not compete.\nFirst repechage.\nTarek Abou Al Dahab of Lebanon withdrew."

There were 32 participants from 32 nations, with each nation limited to one cyclist. The event was won by Pierre Trentin of France, the nation's first victory in the men's track time trial since 1948 and third overall (breaking a tie with Italy and Australia for most-ever in the event). In a sport where competitors rarely competed at more than one Games, Trentin was only the second man to win multiple medals in the track time trial. Niels Fredborg's silver medal was Denmark's first medal in the event since Willy Hansen's win in 1928; Fredborg would go on to be the only man to win three medals in the event. Poland earned its first ever medal in the time trial with Janusz Kierzkowski's bronze. Italy's four-Games medal streak in the event ended as Gianni Sartori took fourth.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The returning cyclists from the 1964 Games were bronze medalist Pierre Trentin of France, eighth-place finisher Roger Gibbon of Trinidad and Tobago, and thirteenth-place finisher José Mercado of Mexico. The two-time reigning world champion, and favorite in this race, was Niels Fredborg of Denmark. Gianni Sartori, the amateur world record holder, and Trentin were also significant contenders.\nBarbados, Lebanon, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and South Korea each made their debut in the men's track time trial; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. France and Great Britain each made their 10th appearance, having competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start.\nRecords.\nThe following were the world and Olympic records prior to the competition.\nThe track was fast, and at altitude, and 17 of the 32 cyclists beat the old Olympic record. The first one to do so was Gianni Sartori (the world record holder), who set a time of 1:04.65. He was immediately followed by Niels Fredborg, who matched Sartori's world record of 1:04.61. That Olympic mark held until rider #24, Pierre Trentin, who broke the world record at 1:03.91."

The Philippines qualified for the World Cup by virtue of the silver medal won by their 2013 FIBA Asia Championship squad.\nTeam Philippines were eliminated on the preliminary round with a 1-4 standing, but almost all of their losses were close games and was won by a small margin. This was the first time in 40 years since the Philippine national squad made an appearance and won a game in the World Cup.\nQualification.\nThe Philippines qualified for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup through their finish in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship which was hosted at home. They secured their place in the world cup by winning 86–79 over South Korea in the semifinal despite failing to clinch the title losing 71–85 to Iran in the final.\nExhibition games.\nOn July 25, 2014, the Philippine national team left for the United States for a training camp in Miami. They had two tune up games in Miami, winning 95–74 over a Miami Pro-Am selection and 93–84 over the Elev8 Sports Institute team which included players from the NBA D-League in its lineup.\nIn Spain, the national team played against a selection team consisting of players from the Liga ACB. They secured a 89–59 win in that game.\nThe Philippines participated in the Antibes International Basketball Tournament which was held in Antibes, France. Their opener against France ended in a 68–75 defeat, and loss their two succeeding games against Australia (75–97) and the Ukraine (64–114).\nThey returned to Spain to play against the Basque Country. They loss 75–66 in their tune up against the Spanish autonomous region. The Philippines had three more tune up games against three national teams; 74–83 loss to Angola, 74–65 win over Egypt, and a 79–86 defeat to the Dominican Republic. A planned game against Mexico was cancelled.\nRoster.\nIn January 2014, the Philippines reportedly want JaVale McGee and Andray Blatche to be naturalized as a Filipino for them to be able to represent the country in the upcoming World Cup. Gilas Pilipinas coach Chot Reyes confirmed the development. Antipolo representative Robbie Puno filed House Bills 3784 and 3783, the naturalization bills of JaVale McGee and Andray Blatche. On June 11, 2014, Blatche officially became a Filipino citizen with President Benigno Aquino III signing the relevant legislation. Under FIBA eligibility rules, Blatche became eligible to play for the national squad as a naturalized player with only one player designated as such only allowed to be a part of any national team.\nGreg Slaughter, Jared Dillinger, Marcio Lassiter and Paul Lee were invited to join the training pool of the national squad and to be part of the 18-man pool, Lassiter and Slaughter expressed gratitude for the decision but declined the invitation because they think that the 12-man roster that played on the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship are the ones who are deserving to play because they worked hard and helped the team to advance to the World Cup. The 18-man squad was decreased to a 16-man squad but they later on added Jay Washington to the pool, to form a 17-man squad.\nLarry Fonacier backed out of the training pool because of being injury-plagued, his two-year-old problem. The 17-man squad was decreased to 16 as Chot Reyes announced the 16-man squad.\nOn August 18, 2014, the final 12-man roster was announced.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local to Spain, UTC+2.\""

        "title": "Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The following article concerns the performance of Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. They played their first home-soil World Cup after 64 years, since the 1950 World Cup, and thus were automatically qualified for the group stage.\nBrazil qualified as first at their group, winning two matches (Croatia and Cameroon) and drawing one (Mexico).\nThey eventually reached the semi-finals, beating Chile and Colombia. Brazil, however, were then knocked out by the eventual champions Germany in a match known as the \"Mineirazo\". In the third-place match, Brazil lost to Netherlands and therefore ended the tournament in fourth place.\nHost selection.\nIn March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its then-active policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations. The decision meant that it would be the first time that two consecutive World Cups were staged outside Europe and the first time two consecutive World Cups were held in the Southern Hemisphere (the 2010 edition was held in South Africa). Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the latter from the process, Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007.\nSquad.\nCoach: Luiz Felipe Scolari\nThe final squad was announced on 7 May 2014. The squad numbers were revealed on 2 June. Neymar suffered a fractured vertebra following a foul by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zúñiga in the quarter-final; it was announced that Neymar would miss the remainder of the tournament.\nGroup stage.\nBrazil vs Croatia.\nThe two teams had met in two previous matches, including in the 2006 World Cup group stage, won by Brazil 1–0. Croatia forward Mario Mandžukić was suspended for the match, after being sent off in the team's final qualifier against Iceland.\nCroatia opened the scoring through a Marcelo own goal, as the ball bounced off him into the net after Nikica Jelavić deflected Ivica Olić's cross. Neymar equalised for the hosts with a shot after receiving a pass from Oscar. In the second half, Brazil took the lead with Neymar's penalty after Dejan Lovren was judged to have fouled Fred in the penalty area. Croatia had a potential equaliser disallowed, after a foul was called on the Brazilian goalkeeper, Júlio César. In added time, Oscar sealed the win, toe-poking the third goal for Brazil from after receiving a pass from Ramires.\nPost-match, FIFA referees chief, Massimo Busacca, defended the officials for awarding the penalty, and insisted there had been some contact between Lovren and Fred even if it was minimal. On the other hand, renowned former top-level FIFA referee Markus Merk criticised FIFA for having Yuichi Nishimura as the referee in the opening match, labelling the refereeing in the match as \"embarrassing\".\nThe game was notable for a number of pioneering events. This was the first occasion in FIFA World Cup history on which an own goal (which was also the first ever own goal scored by Brazil in World Cup finals) opened scoring in the tournament. As the first game played at this World Cup, the match also saw the first use of vanishing spray to mark free kick spots, and the advent of goal-line technology, two innovations introduced during the tournament.\nBrazil vs Mexico.\nThe two teams had met in 38 previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup group stage, all won by Brazil (1950: 4–0; 1954: 5–0; 1962: 2–0). Their most recent meeting was in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Brazil 2–0.\nMexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa made four outstanding saves to deny Brazil. In the first half he saved a header from Neymar tight to his right to push around the post and blocked a close-range effort from Paulinho. In the second half he saved a low shot from Neymar and a late point blank header from Thiago Silva.\nThis was the first time since the 1970 World Cup that the host team drew 0–0 in the group stage. Mexico became the first team from outside UEFA or CONMEBOL to take a point from Brazil in the World Cup. \nCameroon vs Brazil.\nThe two teams had met in four previous matches, including in the 1994 World Cup group stage, won by Brazil 3–0. Their most recent meeting was in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup group stage, won by Cameroon 1–0. Cameroon midfielder Alex Song was suspended for the match (first match of a three-match ban), after being sent off in the previous match against Croatia.\nBrazil, where a draw would guarantee their qualification to the knockout stage, opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Luiz Gustavo crossed from the left for Neymar to beat the goalkeeper with a first time low side-footed finish to the corner. Already-eliminated Cameroon equalised when Allan Nyom beat Dani Alves on the left before crossing for Joël Matip to finish from close range. Neymar put Brazil back in front when he collected the ball from Marcelo and ran at goal before finishing with a low right foot shot that wrong footed the goalkeeper from just inside the penalty area. In the second half, David Luiz crossed from the left for Fred to extend Brazil's lead with a close range header before half-time substitute Fernandinho completed the scoring when he collected a pass from Oscar before finishing with a low right footed shot. The result assured that Brazil pipped Mexico on goal difference to qualify to the knockout stage as group winners.\nThe match was Brazil's 100th in the World Cup, and they followed Germany (which played their 100th match in their first game of the 2014 World Cup) to become the second team to reach the milestone.\nRound of 16.\nBrazil vs Chile.\nThe two teams had met in 68 previous matches, including three times in the FIFA World Cup knockout stage, all won by Brazil (1962, semi-finals: 4–2; 1998, round of 16: 4–1; 2010, round of 16: 3–0).\nBrazil opened the scoring when from a corner David Luiz turned Thiago Silva's flick-on into the net. While replays suggested that Chilean defender Gonzalo Jara may have had the last touch, FIFA later confirmed that the goal was scored by Luiz, not Jara. Chile equalised when Hulk lost possession after a throw-in in his own half, Eduardo Vargas stole the ball and passed to Alexis Sánchez to score. In the second half, Hulk's goal was disallowed as Howard Webb adjudged that the player used his arm in bringing down the ball and gave him a yellow card instead. Chances were few after that with Brazil dominating possession with Hulk forcing Claudio Bravo into a decent save, and the match went to extra time. The best chance of extra time came in the last seconds as Mauricio Pinilla's shot hit the crossbar. In the resulting penalty shootout, the score was tied 2–2 after four rounds, with Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César saving from Pinilla and Sánchez, while Willian missed and Hulk's shot was saved by Bravo. In the fifth round, Neymar scored his penalty, meaning Chile had to score, but Jara's shot hit the inside of the post. Brazil advanced to the quarter-finals to face Colombia.\nThe result meant that in all four World Cups where Chile qualified for the knockout stage, they were eliminated by Brazil.\nQuarter-finals.\nBrazil vs Colombia.\nThe two teams had met in 25 previous matches, but never in the FIFA World Cup. This was the first time Colombia had reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards.\nBrazil took the lead in the 7th minute, when Neymar's corner was turned in from close range by Thiago Silva. They doubled the lead in the 69th minute when David Luiz scored directly from a long range free kick. Colombia reduced the deficit with 10 minutes to go, when James Rodríguez converted a penalty kick, awarded after substitute Carlos Bacca was fouled by Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César. Neymar was kneed in the back by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zúñiga in the 88th minute, which resulted in the striker's withdrawal from the match. Subsequent medical evaluation discovered a fractured vertebra, forcing the Brazilian to miss the remainder of the tournament. Brazil advanced to the semi-final, where they would face Germany.\nRodríguez's goal was his sixth of the tournament, enough to win him the Golden Boot award. He also became the first player to score in his first five career World Cup matches since Peru's Teófilo Cubillas (across the 1970 and 1978 tournaments).\nSemi-final.\nBrazil vs Germany.\nThe two teams had met in 21 previous matches, including in the final of the 2002 World Cup (their only previous encounter in the tournament's history), won by Brazil 2–0.\nWhile Germany kept the same starting lineup as their quarter-final against France, Brazil made two changes: defender and captain Thiago Silva was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards, and was replaced by Dante, while forward Neymar was sidelined after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final against Colombia, and was replaced by Bernard. Germany took the lead in the 11th minute, Thomas Müller volleying in Toni Kroos' corner. Miroslav Klose scored Germany's second goal, after a passing move saw him set up by Müller, his first shot was saved by Brazil goalkeeper Júlio César, but he slotted in the rebound. Kroos then scored two quick goals, the first one after Philipp Lahm's cross was missed by Müller, the second one after stealing the ball from Fernandinho and playing a quick one-two with Sami Khedira. Khedira then scored Germany's fourth goal in six minutes, after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil, to give Germany a 5–0 halftime lead. Substitute André Schürrle added two more goals in the second half, first slotting in from Lahm's cross, then scoring via the crossbar after a cut-back from Müller. Brazil scored a consolation goal in the 90th minute, as Oscar received a pass from Marcelo, dribbled inside and scored. Germany reached their eighth World Cup final, a record by any nation, where they would face , while Brazil had to settle for the .\nThe game equalled Brazil's biggest margin of defeat, a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, and it broke a 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975. The match also broke many World Cup records: It was Brazil's biggest World Cup defeat (eclipsing their 1998 final loss to France), the biggest defeat by a World Cup host nation (previous record was by three goals), and the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup semi-final (three previous semi-finals ended in 6–1 scorelines).\nKlose's goal was his 16th overall throughout his World Cup appearances, allowing him to beat Ronaldo for the record of all-time top scorer in World Cup finals tournaments. Germany's seven goals took their total tally in World Cup history to 223, surpassing Brazil's 221 goals to first place overall.\nThird place play-off.\nBrazil vs Netherlands.\nThe two teams had met in 11 previous meetings, including four times in the FIFA World Cup: Netherlands won 2–0 in the second group stage of the 1974 World Cup and 2–1 in the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup, and Brazil won 3–2 in the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup and 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw (after extra time) in the semi-finals of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\nBrazil made six changes in their starting line-up from their semi-final, while the Netherlands made only two, with Wesley Sneijder, who was originally part of the Dutch starting line-up, replaced by Jonathan de Guzmán after an injury during the pre-match warm-up prevented him from playing. The Netherlands opened the scoring within three minutes, after Robin van Persie converted a penalty kick awarded for a foul on Arjen Robben by Thiago Silva. Daley Blind extended the lead in the 17th minute, scoring after a David Luiz headed clearance fell to him inside the penalty area. Georginio Wijnaldum completed the scoring in second half injury time as he shot home from substitute Daryl Janmaat's cross from the right. \nThe Netherlands finished third for the first time in their World Cup history. With Michel Vorm's participation (who was substituted into the match in second half injury time), the Netherlands became the first team to use all of their 23 players in a World Cup since the finals squads were expanded from 22 to 23 players in 2002. Brazil, who finished fourth for the second time in World Cup history, conceded a total of 14 goals in the tournament, the most they had ever allowed in a World Cup and also the most conceded by any World Cup hosts. Brazil also became the second team to concede 100 World Cup goals, after Germany. "

        "text": "Burton Caswell \"Cy\" Williams (October 12, 1903 – September 28, 1965) was an American college and professional football player who was a tackle for three different professional teams in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) during the 1920s and early 1930s.\nEarly years.\nBurton was born on October 12, 1903, in Canoe, Alabama, to Benjamin Collis Williams and Maria Prescott. His father Benjamin was a long-time turpentine operator at Sopchoppy, Florida. His father died of pellagra in 1913.\nCollege career.\nWilliams attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach James Van Fleet and coach Harold Sebring's Florida Gators football teams from 1923 to 1925. In his first season on the freshman team, the team won the southern crown for freshmen squads. He was remembered as a versatile athlete and a key Gator lineman, blocking the way for such notable Gators backs as Ark Newton and Edgar Jones. During his three-year college career, the Gators had the best three-year streak in the history of the first 20 years of the Florida football program, during which the team compiled a win-loss-tie record of 25–5–4 and finished 8–2 in 1925.\nOne account before the start of his sophomore season at Florida reads: \"Big Cy Williams, star Freshman tackle of last year and probably the Varsity tackle of this year, was the immediate cause of the 'dummy's' downfall for when he dove into the lifeless foe, it collapsed and Cy was deluged with sawdust. A new 'dummy' was brought out but it is predicted that it will not last long under the fierce tackling of the Gators gridders.\"\nProfessional career.\nIn 1926, he played professionally for the Newark Bears of the American Football League, appearing in all five games played by the Bears. The team was notable for the number of players from Georgia Tech, but also included two fellow former Gators, back Ark Newton and lineman Goldy Goldstein. The Bears are remembered for the team's financially weak ownership group, which led to the folding of the team mid-season.\nDuring the 1929 and 1930 NFL seasons, Williams played tackle for the Staten Island Stapletons in 22 regular season games, including 21 of them as a starter. He also appeared in a single game for the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932, before being released.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nWilliams also worked as a professional wrestler during the 1930s."

This was Rob Manfred's first season serving as Commissioner of Baseball.\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game's 86th edition was held on Tuesday, July 14 at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, home of the Cincinnati Reds. The American League won the game 6–3, to give the American League home-field advantage in the World Series.\nSchedule.\nAs was the case in 2014, teams were scheduled to play 19 games against each division opponent for a total of 76 games, and six or seven games against each team from the other two divisions in its league for a total of 66 games.\nAll teams were scheduled to play 20 interleague games throughout the season. For 2015, the interleague matchups were AL East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central, and AL West vs. NL West. Since \"natural rivalry\" matchups will be part of the three-year divisional rotation (for the first time), the schedule format for interleague games was different from previous years. The 20 interleague games each team played consisted of two three-game series (one home, one away) against its natural rival (total of six games), two two-game series (one home, one away) against each team for two other opponents (total of eight games; one of the matchups took place back-to-back within the same week), and a single three-game series against each team for the last two (one home, one away; total of six games).\nDuring the final day of the regular season, all games were scheduled to start simultaneously at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, reminiscent of the English Premier League's last-day \"Survival Sunday\" scheduling. MLB hoped that this would add excitement and drama during the final day, and also limit teams' ability to rest starters at the last minute based on early game results.\nManagerial changes.\nField managers.\nOffseason.\nAt the end of the 2014 season, the following teams made replacements to their managers.\nUniforms.\nWholesale changes.\nThe New York Mets changed their home jersey from a cream shade to white and took away the home white alternate jersey.\nThe Minnesota Twins took away the pinstripes from their home jersey and added a gold trim to the \"Twins\" wordmark. A hat was also added highlighting the \"Twin Cities\" logo in gold.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates introduced a new camouflage alternate jersey in honor of the U.S. Military which will be worn during all Thursday home games.

Fox will televise Saturday night games for eight consecutive weeks, leading up to the All Star Game, which will also air on Fox. Fox will then televise Saturday afternoon games for the last four weeks of the regular season. Fox Sports 1 will televise games on Tuesday nights and Saturdays, both during the afternoon and at night. ESPN will televise games on its flagship telecast, Sunday Night Baseball, as well as Monday and Wednesday nights. TBS will televise Sunday afternoon games for the last thirteen weeks of the regular season. Fox and ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecasts will be exclusive; all other national telecasts will be subject to local blackout.\nTBS will televise the National League Wild Card Game, Division Series, and Championship Series. ESPN will televise the American League Wild Card Game, Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network will televise American League Division Series, and Fox and Fox Sports 1 will televise the American League Championship Series. The World Series will air exclusively on Fox for the sixteenth consecutive year. All postseason games will air on ESPN Radio.\nCanada.\n2015 was the second year of MLB's eight-year contracts for national broadcasts in Canada. Rogers Communications-owned Sportsnet holds English-language rights to the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, almost all postseason games, and various regular season games, all of which are in addition to the channel's Canada-wide \"regional\" deal for all regular season games of the co-owned Toronto Blue Jays.\nWith the Blue Jays reaching the postseason in 2015 for the first time since 1993, Sportsnet president Scott Moore announced the channel was unable to produce separate Canadian telecasts of the Blue Jays' postseason games, and picked up the U.S. network telecasts of these games as it typically did for its postseason coverage. As in 2014, when the two Division Series games carried by MLB Network in the U.S. was also exclusive to that channel in Canada despite very limited carriage, Game 3 of the Royals-Astros ALDS was exclusive to MLBN in both countries. However Sportsnet aired all games of the Blue Jays-Rangers ALDS in Canada (MLBN carried Game 2 in the United States).\nTSN holds English-language rights to most regular season games in ESPN's U.S. package. French-language rights are split between RDS and TVA Sports.\nLocal.\nThe Chicago Cubs opted to re-negotiate their terrestrial television contracts for the 2015 season through 2019, when all the Cubs' television rights contracts will expire, including their cable deal with Comcast SportsNet Chicago. WGN-TV will still hold rights to 45 Cubs games per season, and its overflow broadcasts will move to WPWR-TV in place of WCIU-TV. WGN will be joined by ABC-owned station WLS-TV, which will now broadcast 25 games per season. Broadcast Cubs games among the three stations in the market, along with White Sox games (which will also have games move from WCIU to WPWR) will be carried in the Indianapolis market among Media General's duopoly of WISH-TV and WNDY-TV, in addition to a regional network in Iowa and downstate Illinois.\nThe cable network WGN America will no longer carry Chicago White Sox or Chicago Cubs games, as the network has phased out Chicago sports programming as part of its transition towards becoming a nationally focused entertainment network. This brings an end to the \"superstation\" era of cable broadcast, started in 1976 when WTCG (later to become WTBS) broadcast Atlanta Braves games, followed by WGN and other stations such as WOR-TV (New York Mets), WSBK-TV (Boston Red Sox) and KTLA (California Angels) airing simulcasts via satellite or cable.\nAfter an absence of over a decade, New York Yankees telecasts will return to WPIX, sharing time with the Mets after WWOR-TV gave up its contract due to the rejection of a contract extension. Both teams' games on WPIX will still be produced by the YES Network and SportsNet New York respectively.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio aired its 18th season of national coverage, including Sunday Night Games, Saturday games, Opening Day and holiday games, the All-Star Game, and Home Run Derby, and the entire postseason.\nLocal.\nWBBM became the radio home of the Chicago Cubs starting in April 2015 after long time home WGN gave up the broadcasting rights after 90 years.\nWJZ-FM, for the second time, became the flagship radio station for the Baltimore Orioles. WJZ-FM held the rights for the 2009 and 2010 seasons.\nRule changes.\nNew rules were made to increase the pace of the game."

        "text": "Hamish Fergus Wallace Watson (born 15 October 1991) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a flanker for United Rugby Championship club Edinburgh. Born in England, he represents Scotland at international level after qualifying on ancestry grounds.\nEarly life.\nDuring his early schooling days at Terra Nova school he won the English schools boys national U13 trophy. He then moved to Oakham School and played for Leicester Tigers Academy until the age of 18.\nClub career.\nAt the start of his English professional career he moved to Oakham in Rutland and was at the Leicester Tigers Academy. On moving to Scotland he then played for Edinburgh Rugby.\nInternational career.\nAlthough he was born and raised in England, Watson was eligible to represent Scotland due to his grandfather, who was born in Glasgow, in addition to having lived in Scotland since 2011.\nHe progressed to a centrally held Scotland 7s contract in the summer of 2011 before being approached to join the Edinburgh Rugby elite development programme, after a string of impressive showings in the back-row.\nHe made his Scotland Club XV debut in 2013 while still at Edinburgh Academicals.\nScotland.\nAfter impressing for Edinburgh Rugby, Watson made his international debut in the home defeat to Italy during the 2015 Six Nations Championship.\nHis first international try came during the Autumn Internationals of November 2016 as Scotland beat Georgia with his second coming the following summer in the impressive victory over Australia in Sydney.\nWatson has been a virtual ever-present for Scotland since 2017, garnering numerous Man of the Match awards. Watson was selected in Scotland's squad for the Rugby World Cup in 2019, but suffered a tournament-ending injury in the opening match against Ireland. Watson's outstanding run of form up to and including the 2021 Six Nations Championship, during which he was an ever-present and didn't miss a single tackle during the five matches, saw him ultimately winning the vote for Player of the Championship.\nIn 2023 Watson was selected in Scotland's 33 player squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.\nBritish &amp; Irish Lions.\nWatson's consistently high standards saw him selected in the 37-man squad for the British &amp; Irish Lions 2021 tour to South Africa. He took to the field for the first tour match against the Sigma Lions at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg, becoming Lion #847. He scored a try within seven minutes and was named man of the match. After performing well in the tour's warm-up matches, he was selected on the substitutes' bench for the first Test, coming on early in the second half as the Lions won 22-17 to lead the series.\nPersonal life.\nWatson has gained two nicknames from fans: \"The Mish\", a shortening of his given name, and \"Pinball\", in reference to his unique running style which sees him bounce off several players over a short distance whilst carrying the ball. The nickname \"Pinball\" was given to Watson by the Scottish Rugby Podcast."

        "title": "Andy White (American football)",
        "text": "Andrew Benjamin White, Jr. was a manager of advanced computer projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory where he served as the Deputy Associate Director of the Theory, Simulation and Computing Directorate, and the Roadrunner Project Director from 2006-2012. Before that, he founded and served as Director of the Los Alamos Advanced Computing Laboratory (1989-1998) and Program Manager for the Department of Energy (DOE) High Performance Computing and Communications program. As a college student he had been a quarterback for the University of Texas Longhorns football team. He started one game in 1966 against the Oklahoma Sooners.\nEarly life.\nWhite was the son of a prominent Houston lawyer and an exceptional student and athlete, who served as class president, tied for class valedictorian, and was a highly rated football player. Out of high school he was recruited by almost every team in the Southwest Conference, others in the Southeast and Mideast and by Ivy League schools like Yale, Princeton and Brown, but turned them down to go to Texas, where his father went, as a Plan II student, on an academic scholarship, and play football for Darrell Royal.\nFootball career.\nIn 1966, Andy White was a backup quarterback to fellow sophomore Bill Bradley. He saw limited action in the first two games of the season, missing on three passes and losing seven yards running. But then he took over when Bradley injured his knee during the 3rd quarter of the Indiana game. With the Longhorns up 14-0, White threw for one touchdown, completed 6 of 8 passes, and led an error-free offense to three touchdowns and a 35-0 win over Indiana. The following week against arch-rival Oklahoma, he got the first and only start of his career. Though White accounted for more than 150 yards of total offense, he also threw 2 interceptions and Oklahoma took an early lead. A late Texas rally capped by his only rushing touchdown narrowed the lead to 15-9, but Oklahoma came back to kick a game-cinching field goal and thus Oklahoma broke its streak of 8 straight losses in the Red River Rivalry. When Bradley came back, White again moved to the sidelines, coming in for a few plays over the next two games. With Bradley settled into the quarterback position, White was moved to wingback, and played in two more games before the end of the season, rushing for 20 yards.\nIn 1967, he was moved again, this time to tight end. He got into only one game, catching one 18 yard pass against Rice. In March 1968, faced with the prospect of being the #4 wingback, White quit the football team.\nThe summer before he graduated, Emory Bellard recruited White to help him refine the wishbone formation that would eventually help Texas win the 1969 National Championship.\nScience career.\nWhite finished his degree at Texas and then earned a PhD in applied mathematics from Caltech. He returned to Texas as a mathematics professor, before moving on to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1979 where he served as Program Manager for the Department of Energy (DOE) High Performance Computing and Communications program. Shortly after arriving at Los Alamos, White became deputy leader of a group that began LANL's research efforts into parallel processing. Finding the machines then available inadequate, White founded the Advanced Computing Laboratory in 1989 which utilized the first massively parallel computer suitable for scientific problems. He continued as director of the ACL until 1998 when he was appointed Director of the Laboratory's Delphi Project. White served as an Associate Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Science and Technology Center for Research on Parallel Computation, a member of the ad hoc Task Force on the Future of the NSF Supercomputing Centers (the Hayes Committee), Deputy Division Leader of Los Alamos' Computing Division, and Principal Investigator for the DOE High Performance Computing Research Center at Los Alamos. He became the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for Theory, Simulation and Computation in 2006 and retired from LANL in 2012."

Early during the final, the Soviet Union's Vladimir Afonin was pushed by one or more other runners, fell down, and dropped out of the race. Finland's Juha Väätäinen, who was a strong pre-race favourite, given his explosive kick in the 10,000-metre race, kept observing the situation without taking the lead before the final lap. So did the two other pre-race favourites, France's Jean Wadoux and West Germany's Harald Norpoth. Although Wadoux was several seconds faster than Väätäinen in 1,500 metres, for some strange reason the Frenchman did not try to break away from the Finn before the final lap. Neither did Norpoth, who was also a fast 1,500-metre runner, having placed fourth in that distance at the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics. At the start of the final lap, there were still at least eight or nine runners in the lead group. Finland's young Lasse Viren tried to sprint into the lead, but he was pushed so hard by some other runners that he nearly lost his balance for a few seconds. With about 300 metres left, Väätäinen unleashed his furious kick, and only Wadoux and Norpoth were able to follow him. On the final bend, Väätäinen began to pull away from Wadoux and Norpoth, and stretched his lead further on the home straight. For some seconds, it looked as if also Norpoth would pass Wadoux, but then the French runner was able to accelerate enough to leave the West German runner with the bronze medal. As a result of Väätäinen's double European titles in the long-distance races, a new enthusiasm for the long-distance running began in Finland.

Smith was the leading scorer on Dan McGugin's 1921 Vanderbilt Commodores football team which shared a Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) title, and was retroactively selected for a national title by Clyde Berryman. Smith had previously played for the Middle Tennessee State football team.\nEarly years.\nRupert was born on January 28, 1897, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, to Rufus Taylor Smith and Robert Hodge McAdoo.\nCollege football.\nMiddle Tennessee.\nRupe Smith was Middle Tennessee teammates with future Vanderbilt teammates Jess Neely and P.

Smith was also captain of the 1919 Middle Tennessee team.\nVanderbilt.\n1921.\nRupe was a prominent halfback and the leading scorer for Dan McGugin's 1921 Vanderbilt Commodores football team. In the seventh week of play, Vanderbilt faced the defending SIAA champion Georgia Bulldogs at home on Curry Field. The game was to be the highlight of Vandy's schedule this year, deciding the conference champion. It was described by \"The New York Times\" as an \"important clash.\" Sporting editor for the \"Birmingham News\" \"Zipp\" Newman had written weeks ago, \"Stegeman has a powerful team and with all the regulars in the game, the team has a chance of going through the season undefeated unless it be Vanderbilt that stops her.\" \nThe Bulldogs were the favorite to win this meeting of the two schools, first since 1912, in part because the Bulldogs may have outplayed Harvard and defeated Auburn earlier in the season. Georgia had the greatest line in the South, featuring four men deemed All-Southern in guard Puss Whelchel, center Bum Day, tackle Artie Pew, and end Owen Reynolds. Not one team all year scored on Georgia through its line.\nSoon after the start of the fourth quarter, Jess Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a return of 25 yards to Georgia's 40-yard line before being brought down by Jim Reynolds. Two long pass attempts failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith snuck in behind Ryan, and rushed to recover the 25-yard onside kick. Smith jumped up to get the ball off the bounce among a hoard of Bulldogs, after they had let it bounce, including the outstretched arms of the Bulldogs' Hartley, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. He added his own extra point and the game ended as a tie, 7–7, giving both schools a claim to the conference title."

The Ospreys competed in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Atlantic Sun Conference (A-Sun). They were led by sixth year head coach Matthew Driscoll, and played their home games at UNF Arena on the university's Jacksonville, Florida campus.\nIn their sixth season as a full Division I member, the Ospreys won their first Atlantic Sun Conference regular season and tournament championships and received their first ever NCAA tournament bid. As a No. 16 seed in the south region, they were matched up against fellow No. 16 seed Robert Morris in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio. They were defeated 77–81 despite leading by 14 points in the second half.\nNevertheless, the Ospreys set a program record for wins in a season and drew unprecedented media attention both locally and nationally. They earned the #1 seed and home court advantage in the 2015 Atlantic Sun men's basketball tournament, and advanced to the championship game where they defeated USC Upstate in front of a sold-out, record crowd of 6,155. The season also included two-game sweeps over their crosstown rivals, the Jacksonville Dolphins and conference runner-up Florida Gulf Coast. On December 6, 2014, the Ospreys upset the Purdue Boilermakers on the road, marking their first ever victory over a Big Ten Conference opponent.\nHead coach Matthew Driscoll was named Atlantic Sun Coach of the Year and multiple players earned all-conference honors.\nIn the Week 18 AP poll released on March 9, 2015, the Ospreys received one top-25 vote, the first such occurrence in program history.\nPrevious season.\nThe Ospreys finished the 2013–14 season with an overall record of 16–16, 10–8 record in Atlantic Sun play. In the Atlantic Sun Conference tournament, they were defeated in the quarterfinals by USC Upstate, 80–74.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| Atlantic Sun Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| Atlantic Sun tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#031B49; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament\nSource:"

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and in the KBO League for the LG Twins.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nWilson played college baseball at the University of Virginia for the Virginia Cavaliers from 2009 to 2011. In 2009 and 2010, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Harbor Hawks of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

As a senior, he was the winner of the Senior CLASS Award, given to the most outstanding senior student-athlete in NCAA Division I baseball. After his senior season, Wilson was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 10th round of the 2011 Draft and signed.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nWilson made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Orioles and also pitched that season for the Aberdeen IronBirds.

An NOC without a team in the relevant team event may qualify up to two places in sprint and keirin, and one place in omnium; an NOC with a team may enter that number from its team resources, for a total of twenty three quota places, an increase from the 2012 games which had a one rider per event limit in sprint and keirin; however, a limit of 15 riders (8 men, 7 women ) is placed on each NOC, with the possibility of drafting in two further riders from other cycling events. For certain countries, therefore, the number of quota places earned will significantly exceed the numbers of riders qualified; in effect, members of team events will 'double up', for team sprint athletes in sprint and keirin, and team pursuit athletes in omnium.\nRoad cycling.\nSimilarly, the cyclists who compete in the road time trial must also compete in the road race event; thus an NOC may win 2 quota places, but be allowed to take only one rider.\nTimeline.\nThe following is a timeline of the qualification events for the cycling events at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nTrack cycling.\nMen's team sprint.\nTeams must be composed of 3 riders.\nMen's team pursuit.\nTeams must be composed of 4 riders.\nWomen's team sprint.\nTeams must be composed of 2 riders.\nWomen's team pursuit.\nTeams must be composed of 4 riders."

The objective is not to create combined medal tables; the focus is on listing the best positions achieved by gymnasts in major international competitions, ranking the nations according to the most number of podiums accomplished by gymnasts of these nations. All seven competitive disciplines currently recognized by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) are covered: 1) acrobatic gymnastics, 2) aerobic gymnastics, 3) men's artistic gymnastics, 4) women's artistic gymnastics, 5) women's rhythmic gymnastics, 6) trampoline and tumbling, and 7) parkour.\nResults.\nFrom major senior events.\nFor the making of the list, results from four major senior-level international competitions were consulted, as follows: 1) the Olympic Games; 2) the different editions of the World Gymnastics Championships, organized by FIG for each of the gymnastics disciplines; 3) the different stages of the FIG World Cup, as well as the events that preceded it – the IFSA World Cup and the FIT World Cup; and 4) the World Games, in which gymnastics disciplines that are not yet part of the Olympic Games are contested. According to the 2018 Technical Regulations established by the FIG, as well as the statutes of the organization, these are all considered official FIG competitions. FIG also considers the defunct Four Continents Championships as an official competition, but since the tournament excluded nations from Europe, results have not been included. The Olympic Games, the World Championships, the FIG World Cup and the World Games are the only senior international competitions currently listed on individual profiles at the official FIG database, what indicates their high level of importance. Competitions that are not official FIG events, such as the Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix, or the gymnastics events at the Universiade and Goodwill Games, were not considered for the creation of this list.\nThe conventions used on this table are AC for Acrobatic Gymnastics, AE for Aerobic Gymnastics, MA for Men's Artistic Gymnastics, WA for Women's Artistic Gymnastics, PK for Parkour, RG for Rhythmic Gymnastics, TT for Trampoline and Tumbling.\nThe table is pre-sorted by total number of first-place results, second-place results and third-place results, respectively. When equal ranks are given, nations are listed in alphabetical order.\nFrom major junior events.\nFor the making of this list, results from major junior-level international competitions were consulted, as follows: 1) Youth Olympic Games, and 2) Junior World Gymnastics Championships in acrobatic gymnastics (formerly known as sports acrobatics), artistic gymnastics and rhythmic gymnastics. Before merging with the FIG in 1999, the International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) organized and promoted World Junior Championships in acrobatic gymnastics from 1989 to 1999.\nCurrently, FIG organizes periodical World Age Group competitions in aerobic gymnastics, acrobatic gymnastics, and trampoline. The former governing body for the trampoline, the International Trampoline Federation (FIT), incorporated into the FIG in 1998, also organized World Age Groups competitions from 1973 to 1996. World Age Group competitions were not considered for the making of this list because these events are not officially titled \"World Championships\". In 2019, Junior World Championships were staged for the first time in artistic gymnastics and rhythmic gymnastics.\nThe conventions used on this table are AC for Acrobatic Gymnastics, MA for Men's Artistic Gymnastics, WA for Women's Artistic Gymnastics, RG for Rhythmic Gymnastics, TT for Trampoline. Aerobic gymnastics and parkour have neither been competed at the Youth Olympics, nor Junior World Championships have been organized for these disciplines.\nThe table is pre-sorted by total number of first-place results, second-place results and third-place results, respectively. When equal ranks are given, nations are listed in alphabetical order.\nHistorical teams.\nThese are lists of results achieved by gymnasts from defunct nations, historical teams or teams composed of gymnasts representing different National Olympic Committees (NOCs).\nThe conventions used on the tables are AC for Acrobatic Gymnastics, AE for Aerobic Gymnastics, MA for Men's Artistic Gymnastics, WA for Women's Artistic Gymnastics, PK for Parkour, RG for Rhythmic Gymnastics, TT for Trampoline and Tumbling."

        "text": "In cricket, a player is said to have scored a century when he scores 100 or more runs in a single innings. The ICC Champions Trophy is a One Day International (ODI) tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is considered the second most significant after the World Cup. Originally inaugurated as the \"ICC KnockOut Trophy\" in 1998, the tournament is organised every four years, though it had been organised every two or three years before, and was not held in 2021. A total of 50 centuries were scored by players from 10 different teams. Players from all teams that have permanent ODI status have scored centuries. India leads the list, with ten centuries, followed by Sri Lanka, with seven.\nAlistair Campbell of Zimbabwe was the first to score a century in the tournament, when he made 100 against New Zealand during the inaugural edition. Four players—Sourav Ganguly (India), Herschelle Gibbs (South Africa), Chris Gayle (West Indies) and Shikhar Dhawan (India)—hold the record for the most number of centuries, with three each. A further four players—Saeed Anwar (Pakistan), Marcus Trescothick (England), Upul Tharanga (Sri Lanka) and Shane Watson (Australia)—have each scored two centuries. Gayle's three centuries in 2006 is a record for any player in a single edition. New Zealand's Nathan Astle's 145 against the United States was the highest individual score. South Africa's Jacques Kallis's 113 not out against Sri Lanka in 1998, Ganguly's 141 not out against South Africa in 2000, and New Zealand's Chris Cairns's 102 not out against India in the same tournament feature in the top 100 ODI innings of all-time by a list released by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in 2002.\nSix centuries were made in the finals, with three of them resulting in the centurions being on the championship winning side. The 2002 edition saw ten centuries—all at the Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, the highest for a single tournament, while the fewest centuries were scored in the 2013 edition, with three. The most recent century was made by Fakhar Zaman of Pakistan, when he scored 114 against India during the final of the 2017 edition of the tournament."

Their last game against Norway ended in a goalless draw, leaving Slovenia bottom of their group with two points. Zlatko Zahovič was one of the country's key players, scoring three of the team's four goals in the tournament.\nSlovenia would not qualify for the tournament again for another 24 years, until finally doing so in 2024; during the qualifiers, they finished second in their group, behind Denmark but ahead of Finland, Kazakhstan, Northern Ireland and San Marino.\nEuro 2000.\nGroup stage.\nIn their first major tournament match, Slovenia stunned FR Yugoslavia and took a 3–0 lead after one hour of play, with Zlatko Zahovič scoring twice and Miran Pavlin once. After Siniša Mihajlović's red card, it seemed that the team would win the first match, but then, despite being down to ten players, Yugoslavia made a comeback as they scored three goals in the span of six minutes. In the second game, Spain took the 1–0 lead quickly as Raúl scored in the fourth minute. Slovenia equalised after one hour of play as Zahovič scored his third goal of the tournament. Only one minute later, Spain again took the lead as Joseba Etxeberria scored a game-winning goal. About 10,000 Slovenian fans gathered at the Amsterdam Arena, which is still the record for the number of Slovenian spectators at a football match outside of Slovenia.

While at Navy he was a consensus All-American in 1944\nEarly life.\nJenkins was born in Talladega, Alabama on August 16, 1923 to William Thomas Jenkins and Pauline Odessa West Jenkins. He attended Talladega High School graduating as valedictorian in 1941. A gifted athlete Jenkins played high school football earning All-State and All-Southern in 1939 and 1940. During his final year he accounted for 24 touchdowns.\nPlaying career.\nJenkins lettered in football at the University of Alabama under coach Frank Thomas in 1942. In 1943 he moved on to United States Naval Academy where he lettered in football during the 1943, 1944, and 1945 seasons. In 1944, as a 6-foot 1-inch, 195-pound halfback, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, having received first-team honors from several publications and organizations including the United Press and \"Collier's Weekly\" (Grantland Rice). The three other members of the 1944 consensus All-American backfield were Les Horvath, Doc Blanchard, and Glen Davis, who all won the Heisman Trophy in 1944, 1945, and 1946 respectively. While at Navy the media heaped colorful praise of his playing ability by writing he was a “human dynamo,” “190 lbs fluid force,” and “the piston-legged personification of power.” A knee injury in 1945 ended his football playing career. Jenkins was selected as the sixth pick in the 17th round (170th overall) by the Washington Redskins in the 1945 National Football League draft.\nAfter football.\nJenkins stayed in the Navy until he retired in 1950. He moved to Birmingham, Alabama where he was a businessman and civic leader. In 1959, he founded machine tools business Birmingham called Modern Machinery Associates, Inc. He died on November 23, 2001."

Petra Kvitová of the Czech Republic was the defending champion in women's singles, but she lost to Jelena Janković in the third round.\nSerena Williams won her sixth Wimbledon and 21st major title, defeating first-time finalist Garbiñe Muguruza in the final, 6–4, 6–4. She also achieved her second non-calendar year Grand Slam after winning the 2014 US Open, 2015 Australian Open and 2015 French Open. With this win, Williams also became the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open Era at 33 years and 289 days old, beating Martina Navratilova by 26 days, who won the 1990 Wimbledon Championships at 33 years and 263 days old.\nTournament.\nThe 2015 Wimbledon Championships was the 129th edition of the tournament and was held at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London.\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2015 ATP World Tour and the 2015 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There were singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which were part of the Grade A category of tournaments, and doubles events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category. The tournament was played on grass courts and took place over a series of 19 courts, including the four main showcourts, Centre Court, No. 1 Court, No. 2 Court and No. 3 Court.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe Wimbledon total prize money for 2015 has been increased by 7% to £26.75m. The winners of the men's and women's singles titles will earn £1.88m, up £120,000 from the previous year. The figures for doubles events are per pair.\nSingles seeds.\nSeedings were announced on Wednesday, 24 June 2015.\nGentlemen's singles.\nSeeds are adjusted on a surface-based system to reflect more accurately the individual player's grass court achievement as per the following formula, which applies to the top 32 players according to the ATP rankings on 22 June 2015:\nRank and points before in the following table are as of 29 June 2015.\nBecause the tournament takes place one week later than in 2014, points defending includes results from both the 2014 Wimbledon Championships and tournaments from the week of 7 July 2014 (Newport, Båstad and Stuttgart).\n† The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2014. Accordingly, points for his 18th best result are deducted instead.\nLadies' singles.\nSeeds are based on the WTA rankings as of 22 June 2015.

At the time of the finals Djokovic was ranked No. 1 and Federer at No. 2. This encounter was their third meeting in a Grand Slam final, when the last two previous were split between the two at the 2007 US Open and 2014 Wimbledon Championships. Federer got the first break of serve in the match, during the first set, yet Djokovic quickly broke back leveling the match. When Djokovic was serving to remain in the first set, he had to fend off two set points from Federer, which he eventually got the set into a tiebreak, and it was a lopsided tiebreak that sent Djokovic up one set to none. The second set was a closely fought affair, but was decided to Federer's edge in the tiebreak. The last two sets were rather uneventful in the spectrum of the match because Djokovic got the breaks of serve, allowing him to win his third Wimbledon title, and second in a row. This put Djokovic eighth on the all-time list of Men's Grand Slam singles champions, and putting him fifth during the Open Era. He now possesses as many Wimbledon singles titles, as his coach Boris Becker won in his career.\nLadies' singles.\nThis was their first encounter in a Grand Slam final, whilst all of the past meetings, occurred in Grand Slam events, from the first-time playing each other at the 2013 Australian Open, that Serena Williams won the match in two sets, during this second round match. Their next contest occurred, at the 2014 French Open in the second round, yet this time around Garbiñe Muguruza, turned the tables to with the match in two sets. The third tie came, at the 2015 Australian Open, and it went three sets in a fourth round encounter, to the eventual victory by Serena in three sets. This bout would be their fourth meeting, and it got off to a rocky start by Serena, who served up three double faults, in order to get broken, during the first game of the match. Muguruza would get out to a four games to two advantage, when Williams held serve, and let out a \"Come On\". This rallied the twenty-time Grand Slam champion to win the first set, 6–4, when she broke the serve of Muguruza. Serena would get off to a fast start, during the second set, that she ended up getting breaks of serve from Muguruza in the fourth and sixth games of the set, to go up to a five games to one advantage. The momentous meaning the match held, for Williams ended up hitting her, when she had two bad service games, getting broken, letting Muguruza to come back to a five games to four set. This allowed Muguruza, the opportunity to serve in an attempt to stay in the match and set, yet she quickly got down in a love–40 hole, which she could not escape. The victory gave Serena her second \"Serena Slam\", and that was with the 2014 US Open win counted from the previous year. This victory was her twenty-first Grand Slam singles title, putting her one behind Steffi Graf in the Open Era of tennis, and three behind the all-time record held by Margaret Court. The win meant she became the oldest women's singles Grand Slam champion in the Open Era of tennis, besting the mark previously set by Martina Navratilova.\nWithdrawals.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main tournament, but withdrew with injuries."

It was the eighth edition of the games, which are held every four years and run by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). This was the second time that North America hosted the Games, the previous time being in 2010, also in the United States.\nBidding process.\nThe initial bidding process for the 2018 edition of the World Equestrian Games started in 2011 with the initial application stage. Eight countries expressed their interest, and five of them became official candidates in 2012: Rabat, Bromont, Budapest, Vienna and Wellington. Australia, Russia and Sweden withdrew before the official candidature phase.\nBy 2013, four of the official candidates dropped out, leaving only Bromont in the running. However, instead of awarding the Games to Canada, FEI decided to re-open the bidding process on July 1, 2013, as the Bromont bid was lacking financial support. Bromont remained in the running and was joined by two USA candidates (Wellington and Lexington) as well as Great Britain.\nGreat Britain and Wellington dropped out, leaving only Bromont and Lexington in contention. Bromont was finally awarded the hosting rights on June 9, 2014.\nBromont withdrew from hosting in 2016, as the financial support was not secured. Following Bromont's withdrawal, Mill Spring, North Carolina and Šamorín, Slovakia expressed their interest in hosting the event.

At this era, the volleyball was not a popular sport like what it is now. There was not many clubs which own volleyball teams. Hence, Al Ahly SC was one of the pioneer's clubs in Egypt to introduce this sport into the Egyptian sports community, helping to promote its popularity as well locally. \nIn general, Volleyball was introduced into the Egyptian sports field by the foreign communities, specially those from Mediterranean countries, e.g., Italy and Greece. The 1st club ever in Egypt to introduce and play this sport, was Al Shobban Al Meseheyin club. This was at the inception of the 1920s era. \nBy 1933, roots of volleyball were cemented within Al Ahly. Al Ahly formed his 1st volleyball team ever and started to play some friendly games. E.g., a game against Younan (Greek) club on 1 September 1933. \nThe game ended by 3-1 for Al Ahly. The game was held on Al Ahly ground at Al Gazera. Al Ahly formation for this game was as following; Aziz Fahmy, Ahmed Shoeir. Aziz Barsoum, Mostafa Kamel, Rasmy, and Mokhtar. \nThe second friendly game was played against Al Shobban Al Meseheyin on the 3rd of October 1933, ended by 3-1 for Al Ahly, where the squad was formed of; Aziz Fahmy, Ahmed Shoeir, Aziz Barsom, Mostafa Kamel, Rasmy, and Mokhtar. The game played at Al Ahly ground. \nThe 3rd game in the history of Al Ahly volleyball team, was played against Younan (Greek) club on 18 October 1933. It was a friendly away game on Greek club ground. Al Ahly squad for this game was; Aziz Fahmy, Ahmed Shoeir, Aziz Barsom, Mostafa Kamel, Rasmy, Mokhtar, and Mohamed Fahmy. \nIn 1947, the Egyptian volleyball federation (Which at that time was managing and leading all competitions for both sports volleyball and basketball in Egypt), participated in the formation of the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball \n\"On 1949\", Al Ahly and other 13 clubs contributed in establishing the 1st official committee meeting for the Egyptian volleyball federation who was at that time officially dissociated from the basketball federation, and became a separated independent volleyball federation\nFrom mid of 1950s to mid of 1970s.\nBy the middle of the 1950s, the Egyptian volleyball league was established and during this era, Al Ahly was managed by Ayman Sameh. The squad was composed of the following players: Sayed Mostafa (Captain), Samy Al Seba’y, Yousef Mostafa, Zakaria Morgan, AbdelKhalek Wahba, Maged Mandour. \n1966–1967 season was a special one for the team, when the club managed to clinch its first Egyptian volleyball league title ever. The squad was full of talented players who managed to cement their names in Al Ahly volleyball history. Some notable players in this eras squad were: Mohamad-Fathi El-Rouby, Amr Elwany, AbdelKahled Wahba, Adly Mostafa, AbdelRahman AlWakil, Fou’ad AbdelSalam, Nabeh Salah, Ayman Ghozlan, Adel AbdelMaksoud, Tawfiek Shehab, Mohamed Al Sharif, Nezar Al Zein, Eid AbdelMalak, The team was managed by Sayed Mostafa (Ex-team captain), and the coach was Abdel Latif Ibrahim.\nFrom mid of 1970s to mid of 1980s.\nThis was one of the most shining parts in Al Ahly volleyball history. The team managed to dominate all competitions. At this era, Al Ahly managed to clinch 9 titles of the Egyptian volleyball league (won 9 out of 10 played). Also, managed to win two Egyptian Volleyball cups. The team also won the African champions league twice; 1980 and 1983. Both of those African titles were after beating the rival Zamalek in the final. \nOn 1981, Al Ahly managed to win Afro-European cup that was held in Netherlands by participation of Champions clubs from France and Netherland. It was a great milestone for Al Ahly volleyball to move its excellence to global level; Europe, not only locally and continentally. \nDuring this era; the squad formation was: Nour Attia, Mahmoud Farag, Ibrahim Fakhr Eldin, Ring Lual (Sudanese player), Ihab Fakhr Eldin, Ahmed Zakaria, Shaaban Khalifa, Mohamed Shaarawy, Gomaa AbdelHamid, Tarik Farid, Mamdouh Ismail, Wagih Hamdy, Ayman Fakhr Eldin, Reda ElGhazali, Ahmed AlShamoty, Khaled AlShamoty. Tawfik Shehab and Ihab Fakhr Eldin coach the team in this era.\nMid of 1980s to end of the 20th century.\nThis was a reeling era for Al Ahly. This was because of retirement of the best players, in addition to some other administrative issues during the presidency term of Abdo Saleh Al Wahsh (1988-1992). There was a major conflict between the team players and the club administration, led to departure for the most main and reserve players. \nHowever, during this era, and until 1993, Al Ahly won 3 Egyptian volleyball league titles, and 3 Egyptian volleyball cups, one Arab Volleyball cup in 1987, two African titles in 1990 (which was held in Egypt on Zamalek SC ground), and in 1991 in Algeria. Both of those African titles were clinched after beating the rival Zamalek in the finals. \nBut by 1994, Al Ahly managed to return to conquer the volleyball fields not only in Egypt, but in Africa as well. Al Ahly won the Egyptian Volleyball league 3 consecutive times, 3 consecutive African league cup, and 3 African cup clubs as well. No African team managed to do such achievement to date like Al Ahly has already made in the 1990s.\n1995-96 was astonishing season for Al Ahly. The team managed to win 4 titles in one season for the first time: Egyptian league, Egyptian Cup, African league, African cup. Also, the silver medal for the Arab cup after being beaten in the final against Al Hilal (Saudi Arabia). \nAl Ahly finished the 20th century adding new two Egyptian league titles, two Egyptian cups, and African title after beating Zamalek in Ethiopia in 2000 in the final as usual.\nIn total, between 1995: 2000, Al Ahly won 5 leagues, 2 cups, 3 African league, 4 African cup. Tally of 14 titles. \nIt worth mentioning that during this period, the Egyptian cup was cancelled several times regarding the national team commitment with some official tournaments. \nThe most notable players during this era were: Emad Farouk, Hisham AbdelRazik, Maged Mostafa, Khaled Abbas, Hany Moselhy, Hamdy ElSafy, Mohamed Moselhy, Mohamed AbdelKarim, Mohamoud Gomaa, Sameh Ali Kamel, Ayman Roshdy, Hisham Salah, Yasin Amin, Mohamed AbdelRahman, Wael ElAydi.\nFrom 2001: Current.\nThis era started with little bit fluctuating. Al Ahly lost the local league for the first time after years, withdrawn twice from the cup as it was played without the international players; while there was 7 players and the team coach involved in the national team at that time. Al Ahly lost the African league title as well in 2001 in Cairo against Etoile Sahel Tunisia. \nBut quickly, Al Ahly managed to return to seize the volleyball competitions in Egypt, Africa, and the middle east.\nAl Ahly won the league 3 times, the cup 3 times, and two consecutive Arab cup titles, and two consecutive African titles after beating the Tunisian team Qulaybi in the final, both times in Egypt and Algeria. \nIn 2002–03 season, Al Ahly won 4 titles again after clinching the league, cup, Arab cup, and African league. By 2005–06, Al Ahly repeated the same brilliant performance by winning the same 4 titles in one season.\nThis was so evident, how was Al Ahly so strong in this era. \nBy end of 2005–06 season, the player maker Abdalla Abdelsalam left the club to join the Italian side Treviso. This contributed later in losing the league in 2008, and the cup in 2009, two African finals, and one Arab cup final as well by 2009.\nAl Ahly, the club of century for Volleyball in Egypt and Africa, quickly progressed and by season 2009-10 managed to make a historic season by winning 4 titles again in one season: League, Cup, Aran cup, and African league. In this season, the team played 54 games, won 53 times, and only losing one game in the preliminary local league stage. \nSo, Al Ahly won 4 volleyball titles in the same season 4 times: 1995–96, 2002–03, 2005–06, and 2009–10. The only Egyptian and African team to attain such amazing record. \nAfter the end of the last-mentioned season, Hamdi ElSafy retired, Abdallah AbdelSalam and Ahmed Salah transferred to Europe, Wael Elaydi moved to the rival Zamalek. All of those factors led to give the opportunity for new and youth players such as: Ahmed Kotb, Hossam Youssef, AbdelHalim Ebo, Ahmed AbdelAal, Mohamed Moawad, Ahmed Saied. \nBetween 2015 and 2017, because of dispute with the club sports administration, some of the team players left the club and moved to Army SC. Army SC at that time looked to be like Al Ahly second team (Al Ahly B), and for 3 years, they managed to win 2 leagues, 2 cups, and 1 African title in 2016. Those players were; Ahmed Salah, Abdallah AbdelSalam, Mohamed AlHosseiny, Omar Naguib, Mamdouh AbdelKarim, Mahmoud Ra’of, Mahmoud ElKomy. \nAl Ahly failed to win the league for three times in row. The same for the Egyptian cup. However, Al Ahly won the African titles twice during this period, in 2015 and 2017 in Tunisia. \nBy 2017–18 season, Al Ahly back to the good performance and managed to win three titles in one season: League, Cup, African titles. This was without losing any game during the whole season. \nTally of Al Ahly titles during this era, from 2002 to 2018 was 11 league titles, 12 Egyptian cup, 8 African titles, and 4 Arab cups. This was enough to consider this era as the best across Al Ahly volleyball history. Al Ahly also during this era has participated in the World cup clubs three times; 2010, 2011 and 2015. \nThe most notable players in this era (2000:2010) were: Ahmed Salah, Abdallah AbdelSalam, Mohamed ElSayed, Hamdy ElSafy, Mohamed Moselhy, Osama Komsan, Hossam Shaarway, Maged Mostafa, Mohamed AbdelRahman, Wael ElAydi, Mahmoud Ra’ouf. \n(2010: Current) Ahmed Kotb, Hossam Youssedf, AbdelHalim Ebo, Ahmed AbdelAal, Ahmed Saied, Mohamed Adel Dola, Mohamed Moawad\nMost consecutive volleyball victories in all competitions.\nBeside the total domination of Al Ahly over Africa and being the most crowned club with international trophies all over the world Al Ahly also own the most winning streak known on the volleyball history\nAl Ahly is having a 102 win on the row recording a no lose streak for the last 3 years until 29 January 2020\nThis chain has started on 5 April 2017, During this unbelievable record Al Ahly has been titled with the Egyptian League 2 times, Egyptian Cup 2 times and African Club Championship 2 times\nDuring this chain also Al Ahly has won 18 successive matches with the result 3–0 without losing any set\nThe total sets won during this streak are 303 sets while losing only 20\nThe 102 wins details were as follow\n83 matches has ended as 3–0, 16 matches with 3–1 and only 2 matches finished with the result 3–2.\n36 different teams have been beaten by Al Ahly during this streak, Aviation club is having the most losses by 9 games\nMohamed Moselhy the ex.

However, only two swimmers per nation can qualify for the semi-finals and finals. Prior to FINA's creation of semi-finals in the late 1990s, a total of 3 swimmers per country could qualify for the final and consolation heats of an event, with no more than 2 swimmers per country in a final or consolation.\nFor relays, each country may enter up to one team in each relay event to swim in the final heat and count toward the team score. Countries may also enter a “B” relay that will swim in a preceding heat. These “B” relays may not score points and are not eligible for medals. An NOC may enter up to 1 swimmer per sex (2 total), if they have no swimmers meeting any qualifying B standard."

        "title": "Peter Hauser (American football)",
        "text": "Herman Peter Hauser (June 10, 1887 – July 21, 1935) was a United States Native American football player. He played for the Haskell Indians football team from 1904 to 1905 and for the Carlisle Indians football team from 1906 to 1910 and was selected as a consensus first-team fullback on the 1907 College Football All-America Team. He was a multi-talented player who ran with the ball, handled place-kicking and punt returns, and has been credited as the first player in American football to throw a spiral pass.\nEarly years.\nRecords are in dispute as to Hauser's year of birth. Hauser's World War I draft registration card stated that he was born on June 10, 1887, at Fort Reno, a U.S. Army outpost on the old Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation in Indian Territory, in what later became central Oklahoma. The 1900 Census, on the other hand, recorded his date of birth as being in June 1885. A third birth year, 1884, is suggested by Hauser's entry at the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame.\nBetween 1892 and 1894, U.S. Indian census rolls list Hauser living with his mother (Anna Hauser), and older brother (Emil Hauser) and two younger sisters (Louisa and Anna Hauser) in the Oklahoma territory. Peter and Emil were listed as students at the Halstead School.\nBy 1896, Hauser's mother had remarried, and the family was living with the mother's new husband, Waldo Reed.\nBy 1900, Hauser and brother, Emil, were no longer with their mother or sisters and were listed as orphans at the Mennonite Orphan &amp; Aid Society in Lakin Township, Harvey County, Kansas. They were listed as having had a German father and an Indian mother. Hauser's entry at the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame describes him as Cheyenne.\nFootball player.\nBy 1904, Hauser was a student at the Haskell Institute, a boarding school established for Native American children. He played football for the Haskell Indians football team from 1904 to 1905. In November 1904, the Haskell football team played an exhibition game at the St. Louis World's Fair before a crowd of 12,000 spectators. Hauser, playing at the right end position, scored Haskell's only points on a field goal from the 18-yard line.\nIn 1906, he was transferred to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There, he played for the Carlisle Indians football team from 1906 to 1910 under head coach Glenn Scobey Warner.\nHauser became a star during the 1907 season. In an early game, he scored a touchdown and kicked a field goal in a 10–0 victory over Villanova. In October 1907, Hauser ran for a touchdown and kicked to goals after touchdown, scoring eight points, in Carlisle's 14–6 victory over the team from Syracuse University. In November 1907, \"The New York Times\" wrote that Hauser handled kicking duties for Carlisle, returned punts, and was also \"the mainstay of the defense.\" That same month, Carlise defeated the Harvard football team, then one of the top teams in the country, by a 25–13 score in front of a crowd of 30,000 spectators in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"The New York Times\" wrote that Hauser's end runs were \"marvels\" and that he was able to circle the Harvard ends \"at will.\" Carlisle's 1907 season ended with an 18–4 victory over Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons football team. Hauser was described as \"a one-man wrecking crew\" against Chicago, as he kicked two field goals and an extra point and threw a 50-yard touchdown pass as well.\nHauser's most historic moment, however, came on October 27, 1907, against a Penn team that won every other game and was declared national champion. The \"national champions\" lost to Carlisle by a 26–6 score. At a time when forward passes were generally short tosses, Hauser threw a pass 40 yards, hitting his receiver in stride. In her history of Native Americans in football, Sally Jenkins called Hauser's long, 40-yard spiral pass against Penn one of the \"three or four signal moments in the evolution of football\" and \"the sporting equivalent of the Wright brothers taking off at Kitty Hawk.\" The \"Philadelphia North American\" compared it to the \"puny\" passes of the day, called it \"a lordly throw, a hurl that went farther than many a kick,\" and predicted that Hauser's throw would be \"talked of often this year.\" Hauser's secret was throwing the ball in a spiral, allowing it to travel farther downfield. Carlisle head coach, Pop Warner, said that Hauser was credited as the first football player to throw a spiral pass and could \"hit his ends on the dead run with uncanny accuracy.\"\nAfter the 1907 season, Hauser was selected as a consensus first-team fullback on the 1907 College Football All-America Team. Hauser and teammate, Albert Exendine, became the third and fourth Carlisle players to receive consensus All-American honors, following halfback Isaac Seneca in 1898 and quarterback Jimmy Johnson in 1903. Jim Thorpe became Carlisle's fifth consensus All-American in 1911. Carlisle coach Warner chose Hauser at the fullback on his all-time Carlisle football team and compared him favorably to Thorpe. According to Warner, Hauser was \"practically a replica of Jim Thorpe.\"\nLater years.\nHauser returned to El Reno, Oklahoma, the town that had built up around his birthplace at Fort Reno. He took an allotment and died in an automobile accident while changing a tire. Accounts differ as to whether he died in 1935, or the 1940s. He was posthumously inducted into the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame in 1987."

Points for lower places differed from one category to another. Every participant was guaranteed at least 2 points for participation and 5 points for qualifying for the semifinal run (10 points in the World Cup Final). If two or more athletes or boats were equal on points, the ranking was determined by their positions in the World Cup Final.\nResults.\nWorld Cup Race 1.\nIvrea, Italy hosted the Canoe Slalom World Cup for the first time. It was also the first time that K1 slalom cross for men and women was an event at a world cup race. No world cup points were awarded for the cross event. The events took place from 3 to 5 June.\nWorld Cup Race 2.\nThe second race of the series took place at the Segre Olympic Park in La Seu d'Urgell, Spain from 10 to 12 June.\nWorld Cup Race 3.\nThe third race of the series took place at the Pau-Pyrénées Whitewater Stadium, France from 17 to 19 June.\nWorld Cup Race 4.\nThe penultimate race of the series took place at the Prague-Troja Canoeing Centre, Czech Republic from 2 to 4 September.\nWorld Cup Final.\nTacen, Slovenia hosted the World Cup Final from 9 to 11 September with double points awarded in each category. During the semifinal run of the men's C1 event a newly built concrete block near the end of the course started to crack. This forced the organizers to shorten the course for the rest of the events. The course only had 14 gates after the change. The jury also allowed the top 15 from the men's C1 semifinal to qualify for the final instead of the top 10 because the crack affected some of the later runners like Nicolas Peschier and Pierre-Antoine Tillard."

HB Studios had not developed a rugby union game since Rugby World Cup 2011, which was published by 505 Games. HB Studios then however announced the intention to start releasing an annual rugby game. This did not occur, and future videogames in the series were developed by a different studio.\nModes.\nIt was possible to play an individual match with up to 4 local controllers, play in any of the licensed competitions or a custom created competition. The game does not feature a player and team customization mode or a career mode. No online mode existed in the game as the developers want to focus on the basics of the game to improve for future editions, which may include an online mode.\nFeatures.\nThe weather would play a large part in gameplay with the wind affecting the projection of the ball and rain causing the pitch to deform and players to get muddy.\nTeams and stadia.\nThe game features licences for all clubs in the Top 14, Pro D2, Premiership and Pro12. There is one in-game stadium that is used for every team.\nReception.\n\"Rugby 15\" received \"generally unfavorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic."

        "text": "The Grenada national cricket team represents the country of Grenada in cricket. The team is not a member of the International Cricket Council, but the Grenada Cricket Association is a member of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from Grenada generally represent the Windward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. Grenada has however played as a separate entity in matches which held Twenty20 status, but has not appeared in first-class or List A cricket. The team's coach, as of November 2013, is Ricky Williams. The team currently has two captains: Devon Smith, who captains the two-day team, and Andre Fletcher who captains the 20-over team.\nHistory.\nA Grenada cricket team first appeared in West Indian cricket in 1887 against a touring Gentlemen of America team at the old Queen's Park. Ten years later the team was recorded playing against Lord Hawke's touring team, though unlike several matches during the tour, this match did not have first-class status. In 1899, G. A. de Freitas and William Mignon became the first Grenada cricketers to play first-class cricket. In 1910, Grenada played in the inaugural Cork Windward Islands Challenge Cup, with the team participating in that tournament until 1939. There is a long gap between 1939 and Grenada's next recorded appearance, which came in the 1965 Windward Islands Tournament against St Vincent. By this time the Windward Islands were playing matches which held first-class status, with Queen's Park playing host to the team's inaugural first-class fixture in 1959 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. Grenada continued to play in the Windward Islands Tournament, and from 1975 its successor, the Heineken Trophy. Their participation in the tournament (under various names) continued into the 1990s, with home matches throughout this period being held at the old Queen's Park.\nIn 2000, just months after a major redevelopment, the old Queen's Park was severely damaged by Hurricane Ivan, necessitating its reconstruction in 2004. Having played in regional tournaments throughout the early to mid 2000s, Grenada were invited to take part in the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. They played three matches in the tournament, defeating Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the first-round and quarter-final respectively, before losing to Guyana in the semi-finals. Two years later, they were invited to take part in the 2008 Stanford 20/20, playing two matches in the tournament, defeating Anguilla in the first-round, before losing to Barbados in the following round. These matches mark Grenada's only major appearances in cricket.\nIn August 2014, Grenada played against Bangladesh in a 50 over game during Bangladesh's tour of the West Indies. Bangladesh ran out winners by 95 runs.\nNotable players.\nInternational Players.\nFive players from Grenada have represented the West Indies Internationally.\nMany other Grenadian players have represented the Windward Islands cricket team domestically in the West Indies Regional Super50, Regional Four Day Competition and the Caribbean Twenty20.\nSquad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\nsource: "

The match was played in virtually unplayable conditions due to the state of the waterlogged pitch caused by heavy downpours both before and during the game.\nThe final is best remembered for Wakefield's Don Fox missing a conversion from in front of the posts in the last minute of the game, handing Leeds an 11–10 victory. It was the club's eighth Challenge Cup win, and the first since 1957. Fox was the winner of the Lance Todd Trophy, as he had already been voted as man of the match before his miss."

        "text": "Matt Thomas (born October 25, 1975) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and is currently an assistant coach with the Providence Bruins in the American Hockey League.\nCareer.\nFollowing in his brother, Art's footsteps, Matt Thomas started his college career as a player for RIT during a period where the team was at the top of the Division III ranks. The Tigers finished as national runners-up in his sophomore season and continued with two more strong campaigns (including Thomas being captain in his final year), before Thomas ended his playing days and turned to coaching. Thomas stayed with RIT for one season as an assistant before moving on to Division I, signing up with Maine in the early 2000s. Thomas arrived in Orono, Maine, just after Shawn Walsh was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and helped the team through the difficult period when Walsh died the following year and the team was turned over to Tim Whitehead.\nThomas remained under Whitehead for one year before heading to the professional ranks, serving as an assistant for the Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies in the ECHL for two seasons before being promoted to head coach and director of hockey operations for the 2004–05 season. After the 42-win debut, Thomas was offered a position with the Fresno Falcons and moved west to take the job. Thomas continued his success in the ECHL with a 43-win, 100-point season, ending with Fresno reaching the conference finals in 2006. Thomas was able to get the Falcons to reach the playoffs in each of the following two seasons, but in 2008–09, with the economic downturn, Fresno announced that they would cease operations 30 games into the season, ending Thomas' tenure with the team. Thomas did not remain unemployed for long as his former team, since having relocated, offered him the chance to turn around their season and Thomas agreed to take over as head coach for the Stockton Thunder.\nWith the Thunder, Thomas was able to get the team back on the right track and make the playoffs is his half-season behind the bench. The next year he reached the conference finals for the second time and was finally able to get into the championship series in 2013. With his success at the minor professional level, Thomas was offered the chance to improve the NCAA Division I Alaska-Anchorage, which had not had a winning season in 20 years and agreed to take over from the departed Dave Shyiak. The Seawolves then produced their first above-.500 record since joining the WCHA. The following year saw the team produce 10 fewer wins and the program trended downward, finally bottoming out in 2018 with a record of 4–26–4. After his contract expired, Thomas left the program to return to professional hockey.\nOn 7 August 2018, he returned to the ECHL and was announced as the new head coach of the Cincinnati Cyclones. In his first season in Cincinnati, he led the team the regular season title and won the John Brophy Award for ECHL coach of the year. Prior to the start of the 2021–22 season, head coach Thomas was hired by the AHL's Providence Bruins as an assistant coach."

The team was founded in 1977, under the name Edinburgh, by steel magnate David Murray, and was backed by a sponsorship from his company, Murray International Metals. Using the name Murray International or MIM Livingston, they went on to be one of the most successful clubs in Scottish basketball history, playing first in Edinburgh, and then later moving to Livingston.\nHistory.\nDuring the height of its success, Livingston were Scottish National League Champions seven times between 1979 and 1987. The club were founder members of the British Basketball League, a professional league established in 1987 by leading clubs from England and Scotland. Playing out of the newly built 3,000-seat Forum Arena, Livingston were successful in their inaugural season and with an 81–72 victory over regular season champions Portsmouth, were winners of the first Carlsberg League Championship Final.\nIn 1988 Murray acquired Rangers Football Club and inherited plans to form a 'sporting club' as the previous owner had bought Carlsberg League club Kingston for £100,000 and moved them to Glasgow. The Glasgow Rangers basketball team made their first appearance alongside Livingston in the 1988–89 season, becoming the league's second Scottish club. Rangers dominated the campaign, pipping Livingston to the regular season title and then beating them in the final of the Championship Play-offs, winning 89–86. Livingston also finished as runners-up in the NatWest League Trophy, losing 89–81 to Bracknell in the Final.\nDespite the success of his two basketball teams, Murray was rumoured to have had a fall out with the basketball authorities in 1989 over a proposal to have both teams playing at The Forum Arena on alternate weekends, meaning a home game would be staged every week. The move was blocked and so Murray withdrew his financial support. The Rangers team was sold and moved back to Kingston-upon-Thames in 1989, whilst the Livingston club briefly returned to the Scottish League before becoming the Livingston Bulls."

And if I do say so myself, I think I became the second-best football player to ever come out of the Bronx. The best was a guy I played against named Jim White, an end, a tackle, a fullback, an all-everything for All Hallows High School. He went to Notre Dame. Then he played for the Giants. And if he never quite lived up to expectations in the pros, I'd still have to say he was the best goddamn high-school athlete I've ever seen, a tough, dirty sonofabitch. But good.\""

The statue commemorates Wellington's assistance to the City of London in ensuring that a bill was passed to allow the rebuilding of London Bridge.\nThe base of the statue is a ventilation shaft for Bank and Monument stations on the London Underground. It was converted during expansion of Bank station in 1994.\nHistory.\nWhile sitting for a later portrait by Charles Robert Leslie, Wellington recalled that Chantrey had told him he had a square head. After Chantrey's sudden death his studio assistant Henry Weekes completed the sculpture.\nWellington attended the unveiling of his statue on 18 June 1844. The date was chosen to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo, where Wellington led an allied army to victory against Napoleon, in 1815. Frederick Augustus II, King of Saxony, who was in London visiting Queen Victoria, also attended the unveiling.\nDescription.\nThe equestrian statue was erected to show the City's gratitude for Wellington's help in assisting the passage of the London Bridge Approaches Act 1827. This Act led to the creation of King William Street.\n\"Wellington\" is inscribed on each side of the plinth; on its ends is the inscription \"Erected June 18, 1844\". A brass plaque at the plinth's base reads:"
