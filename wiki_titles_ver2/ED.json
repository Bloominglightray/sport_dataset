        "text": "A basketball card is a type of trading card relating to basketball, usually printed on cardboard, silk, or plastic. These cards feature one or more players of the National Basketball Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Olympic basketball, Women's National Basketball Association, Women's Professional Basketball League, or some other basketball related theme.\nSome notable producing companies include Panini Group (present days), Bowman Gum and Topps (in early days).\nHistory.\nThe first basketball cards were produced in 1910, in a series cataloged as \"College Athlete Felts B-33\". The complete series included ten different sports, with only 30-cards being associated with basketball. The cards were issued as a cigarette redemption premium by The number of packages needed to redeem for the tobacco cards is not known.\nThe next series of basketball cards were issued in 1911, in two separate series, \"T6 College Series\", measuring approximately 6\" by 8\", and \"T51 College Series\", measuring approximately 2\" by 3\". These series included a variety of sports, with only 6-cards being associated with basketball. One card from the T6 series, and five cards from the T51 series. Both series were produced in two variations; one variation reading \"College Series\", the other, \"2nd Series\". The cards were acquired in trade for fifteen Murad cigarette coupons. The offer expired June 30, 1911.\nBasketball cards were not seen again until 1932, when C.A. Briggs Chocolate issued a 31-card set containing multiple sports. In exchange for a completed set of cards, Briggs offered baseball equipment. \nBowman Gum produced the first NBA cards, starting in 1948, releasing a 72-piece set that included the George Mikan rookie card. Another US company, Topps, began to manufacture cards during the 1958, returning to production in 1969–70. Fleer had its peak in 1961-62, returning in 1986–87, to resurrect the basketball card industry by releasing a 132-card NBA officially licensed set which included the rookie cards of NBA Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Clyde Drexler, Joe Dumars, Chris Mullin, Hakeem Olajuwon, Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone and Charles Barkley as well as an additional 11 card sticker set. This set is seen by many basketball card collectors as the \"1952 Topps of basketball.\" In the 1990s/2000s, several companies produced basketball cards, including Topps, Hoops, Skybox, Fleer, and Upper Deck.\nIn 2009, the NBA licensed the rights to manufacture and commercialize basketball cards to Italian Panini Group, which became the only licensor for the league and players. Panini has been NBA licensee since then.\n2020-21 Panini Flawless Triple Logoman featuring LeBron James was sold for 2.4 million."

A three-day tour match between West Indies and Sri Lanka Cricket president's XI was also played at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground from 10 to 12 November.\nWhen the 3rd match of the Test series was played at Pallekele in Kandy, Pallekele International Cricket Stadium became the 104th Test venue in the world. The stadium is also Sri Lanka's eight.\nA five-match ODI series and a single Twenty20 match were originally scheduled to be played from 9–19 and 21 December respectively. Due to bad weather, the ODI series was changed to three matches in late January 2011 and the Twenty20 match cancelled.\nBritish Eurosport bagged the rights to show the matches in the United Kingdom.\nSquads.\n‡ Sri Lanka named a 16-man squad for the first two one-day internationals on 4 December 2010.\nTest Series.\nAlan G. Hurst of Australia served as the match referee for the Test series.\n1st Test.\nShane Shillingford was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action during the Test. He had match figures of five for 202 in the Test. Shillingford was reported to the International Cricket Council (ICC) by the two on-field umpires, as well as TV umpire Asad Rauf and fourth umpire Tyron Wijewardene due to a straightening of the arm during his \"Doosra\" delivery.\n2nd Test.\nThe 2nd Test was held at the R. Premadasa stadium despite its undergoing extensive renovation. The Sri Lankan Cricket Board defended choosing Premadasa stadium saying that the decision to stage a game was to allow cricketers to acclimatise themselves to the ground ahead of the 2011 World Cup games.\nSri Lanka cricket selectors recalled Nuwan Kulasekara and uncapped Shaminda Eranga for the second Test and dropped fast bowlers Dammika Prasad and Thilan Thushara, who went wicketless in the Galle Test. Suranga Lakmal made his Test debut to become Sri Lanka's 114th Test player.\n\"Day 1\" only saw 37. 2 overs of cricket due to a damp outfield and gloomy conditions. Sri Lanka went to stumps at 84 for three with Kemar Roach taking the wickets of Sri Lankan openers, Tharanga Paranavitana (16) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (4). On \"Day 2\" Kumar Sangakkara completed his 24th Test century with an unbeaten 135 to guide Sri Lanka to 294 for five, when rain forced again a premature end. On \"Day 3\" despite Sangakkara's departure for 150 in the morning, Sri Lanka looked to step up the scoring and declared at 387 for 9 after the tail chipped in with some valuable runs. In reply West Indies closed the day on 165 for five wickets with hosts gaining some edge with late strikes. Darren Bravo top scored for the visitors with a classy 80 only to end his innings in the day's penultimate over. Rain prevented any play on \"Day 4\". In the afternoon play of \"Day 5\" Sri Lanka took the remaining five West Indies first-innings wickets in less than two hours. Rangana Herath topped Sri Lanka's bowling and finished on 3/76. Sri Lanka made a solid start in the evening session and declared at 57 for one wicket. Later Kummar Sanggakara said that he made the surprise declaration to try to get the psychological advantage over the visitors. The ploy worked for Sri Lanka, as they put pressure on the West Indies top order with ten overs of testing bowling. At the close West Indies were 12 for 2.\n3rd Test.\nOn the opening day, Pallekele International Cricket Stadium became the 104th Test venue in the world and Sri Lanka's eight. Nuwan Kulasekara, who played the 2nd Test was left out of the Sri Lankan side due to a side strain. He was replaced by medium pacer Dilhara Fernando.\nThe start of the match was delayed by a wet outfield and heavy rains. Bursts of rain just after lunch and bad light in the evening contributed to shorten \"Day 1\" which only saw 40 overs of play. Suranga Lakmal trapped Chris Gayle Leg Before Wicket (LBW) for a duck with the day's first delivery to begin Test cricket at the new venue in dramatic fashion. By dismissing Gayle, he became the third bowler to take a wicket with the first ball bowled in a test match at a new venue, joining Kapil Dev of India and Imran Khan of Pakistan.\nAt close of play, half-centuries from inform Darren Bravo and Devon Smith helped the West Indies to reach 134 for 2 on \"Day 1\". Only 41 overs of play were possible on \"Day 2\" due to rain. West Indies were 244 for 5 at the close of play with Brendan Nash on 62 and Carlton Baugh yet to score. Rain prevented any play on Day 3 and only 20 overs were possible on Day 4. Rangana Herath struck three times in the morning of \"Day 4\" to claim the wickets of Brendan Nash, Carlton Baugh and Darren Sammy. No play was possible on \"Day 5\" due to rain. A draw was declared after the match was called off at 1:30 pm local time.\nODI series.\nFive matches were originally scheduled for 9, 11, 15, 17, 19 December 2010. The Twenty20 match was scheduled for 21 December."

        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured England from 21 July to 16 September 2011. The tour consisted of one Twenty20 International (T20I), five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and four Test matches, as well as a number of matches against English county sides. The opening Test at Lord's was the 2,000th Test. England's victory in the Third Test put them number one in the world rankings.\nSquads.\n† Virat Kohli, Pragyan Ojha and RP Singh replaced the injured Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan, respectively, for the third and fourth Test matches.\n‡ Ravindra Jadeja replaced the injured Gautam Gambhir for the ODI series.\nTour matches.\nFirst-class: Somerset v Indians.\nIndia rested a number of their Test players for their first match of the tour; Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar and Harbhajan Singh were all left out of the team. The weakened bowling attack showed on the first day of the match, when Somerset scored 329 for the loss of two wickets from a rain-reduced 75 overs. Andrew Strauss, the England Test captain and Middlesex player, opened the innings as a guest batsman for Somerset, showed aggression initially, scoring 78 runs out of an opening partnership of 101, before getting out. Andrew McGlashan, summarising the day for \"ESPNcricinfo\", described his innings as \"commanding\", and his shots \"in good working order\". After Strauss' dismissal, his opening partner Arul Suppiah began to score more freely, and reached his century off 179 balls, scoring his second 50 from just 57 deliveries. Suppiah and Nick Compton put on a second wicket partnership of 223 before Compton was dismissed for 88. Suppiah reached 156, his highest first-class score before he was out, and Somerset eventually declared their innings closed at 425/3.\nIn reply, the Indians struggled with the bat during the second, rain affected day; Somerset's Charl Willoughby took five wickets against a batting line-up which showed its lack of match practice. On the third morning, Suresh Raina controlled the strike well to bat his way to a century and stake his claim for a place in first Test, dominating a final wicket partnership of 84. Somerset once more look assured with the bat during their second innings, in which Strauss reached a century, eventually finishing 109 not out, and Peter Trego scored a rapid 85 runs from 57 balls. Somerset declared at tea on the final day, leaving India only a short period to bat in the second innings. The match finished as a draw, but Somerset coach Andrew Hurry suggested that Somerset had \"bullied\" India, and that it had been \"a perfect three days\" for Strauss.\nTest series.\nEngland won the Test series 4–0, their third whitewash in series of more than three Test matches. In winning the series by more than two clear matches, England took India's place at the top of the ICC Test Championship, while India dropped to third place. The men of the series were England's Stuart Broad – who took 25 wickets in the series – and Rahul Dravid – who scored three centuries.\n1st Test.\nThis match was the 2,000th Test in the history of cricket and the 100th between India and England. India's tour got off to the worst possible start with Zaheer Khan injuring himself on the first morning, leaving India with just three regular bowlers for the rest of the match. England made the most of the numerical advantage with Pietersen scoring a double-century as England declared with the score on 474/8. India responded well initially, but were soon bundled out for 286 with Rahul Dravid's century being the saving grace. England worked themselves into a position of control in the second innings, with India's bowling lacking any penetration. India were bowled out on the final day of the Test with nearly 30 overs to spare.\n2nd Test.\nIn their first innings, England were 124/8 at one point and looked sure to be dismissed for a very low first innings score. Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann then had a partnership of 73 runs and salvaged the innings for England who were eventually dismissed for 221. In reply, India reached a dominant score of 267/4 with Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh sharing a partnership of 128 runs before England bowler Stuart Broad took a hat-trick, dismissing MS Dhoni (caught Anderson), Harbhajan Singh (lbw) and Praveen Kumar (bowled) and finished with his best Test figures to date, with 6 for 46. This hat-trick was part of a remarkable spell of 16 balls in which Broad got five wickets without conceding a run. India were eventually also dismissed for less than 300, with 288. Ian Bell was involved in a controversial run-out decision with the final delivery before tea on the third day when he was on 139 not out. Bell walked off the field, believing that the previous shot played by Eoin Morgan had gone to the boundary for four. However, the ball had been kept in play and was thrown back to the middle, where India removed the bails. It was referred to the third umpire, Billy Bowden, who gave Bell out. During the tea interval, England captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower met with the Indian captain Dhoni and their coach Duncan Fletcher and they agreed to withdraw the appeal. Bell was eventually dismissed for 159. England continued to bat strongly with tail-ender Tim Bresnan getting 90 runs. England were eventually bowled out for 544, setting India a target of 478 runs to win. India's response to this target was poor and they slumped to 68/6 at tea on day 4. England dismissed India's top second innings scorer, Sachin Tendulkar for 56 soon after tea. England wrapped the game up in the evening session, finally dismissing India for 158 runs, winning by 319 runs.\n3rd Test.\nIndia were put into bat by England and were reduced to 111 for 7, before making a slight recovery to finish 224 all out on the first day. Alastair Cook made 294, the sixth highest score by an English batsman, as England finished on 710 for 7. Indian batsman Virender Sehwag was dismissed for golden duck in both innings of the match – a king pair. Sachin Tendulkar was run-out on 40, after backing up MS Dhoni, when Dhoni's strike was deflected back onto the stumps by Graeme Swann."

        "text": "In American slang, the term inside baseball refers to the minutiae and detailed inner workings of a system that are only interesting to, or appreciated by, experts, insiders, and aficionados. The phrase was originally used as a sports metaphor in political contexts, but has expanded to discussions of other topics as well. Language commentator William Safire wrote that the term refers to details about a subject that require such a specific knowledge about what is being discussed that the nuances are not understood or appreciated by outsiders.\nOrigin of the term.\nThe term originated in the 1890s, referring to a particular style of playing the game which relied on singles, walks, bunts, and stolen bases rather than power hitting. Within a few decades the term was being used to mean highly specialized knowledge about baseball, and by the 1950s it was being applied to politics."

Neilson graduated from Princeton in 1897.\nDuring World War I, Neilson served in the United States Army infantry as a lieutenant. In 1917, at the age of 41, he reported for officers training, located in Plattsburgh, New York. In 1918, Neilson took part in the Second Battle of the Marne, during which his commanding officer was killed. During the battle he was wounded, but still took command of his fellow soldiers and safely entrenched them for 24 hours. He suffered a bullet wound to the stomach and several shrapnel wounds. He spent the rest of the war hospitalized and was later awarded the French War Cross and the Distinguished Service Cross.\nAfter the war, he returned to Princeton to serve as an assistant coach from 1919 until his death in 1963.

        "title": "Umpiring in the 1970–71 Ashes series",
        "text": "The England team disputed several umpiring decisions in the 1970–71 Ashes series, Ray Illingworth, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow in particular. After the series Boycott and Snow were called to a disciplinary hearing at Lords over their behaviour, and Illingworth and Snow never toured again. Only three umpires were used; Lou Rowan, who was most involved in the controversy, and his colleagues Tom Brooks and Max O'Connell who both debuted as Test umpires in the series. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to make decisions based on what they saw in a split second, with the benefit of the doubt always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw.\nLou Rowan was a policeman and became senior umpire after the retirement of the much respected Col Egar. He was inclined to stand on his authority and retired at the end of the series. In 1972 he wrote \"The Umpire's Story\" which was highly critical of the England team, particularly of Illingworth and Snow. It even queried \"was John Snow actually grabbed by a spectator who objected to Snow flattening an Australian batsman?\". regardless of photographic evidence to the contrary. John Snow in his autobiography \"Cricket Rebel\" devoted a whole chapter to \"Bitter Rows with Umpire Rowan\" in which he wrote 'I have never come across another umpire so full of his own importance, so stubborn, lacking in humour, unreasonable and utterly unable'. E.W. Swanton was not convinced that the umpires were biased \"...the old hobby horse trotted out of the alleged incompetence of Australian umpires. There were ructions ahead, of course, but my view was that Rowan, Tom Brooks and M.G. O'Connell, who shared the umpiring in the series, did a good job all through.\"\nIn the Second Test Ray Illingworth was put in to bat, but Rowan refused his request for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later realised his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even if I did not agree with him' and that they could talk problems through. Brooks was the only one of the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.\nIntimidatory bowling.\nJohn Snow wrote that Lou Rowan was 'utterly unable to distinguish between a delivery short of a length which rise around the height of the rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high'. and believed that chest high balls were not intimidatory. However, English umpire Dickie Bird wrote \"as far as I am concerned, intimidatory bowling is the fast, short pitched ball into the region of the batsman's ribcage. When such a ball is fired in it is then that I feel an umpire must be firm...and tell the bowler to cut it out...that's the killer ball, and that is when I always step in\". As Snow hit tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner on the head in the series and continually bowled short at the other Australian batsmen it was not unreasonable for the umpires to intervene. Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth.\nSnow was twice warned by Rowan for intimidatory bowling in the Second Test at Perth, but he refused to accept that rib high balls were intimidatory and continued to bowl them. As a result Snow was given an official warning, which meant that he would not be allowed to bowl if he was warned again. Illingworth told him that this was to be his last over in any case and the fast bowler sent his last ball flying over the head of Doug Walters, turned to Rowan and said \"Now that's a bouncer for you\". In the Seventh Test Rowan warned Snow again when he hit tailender Terry Jenner on the head with a short ball, but waited until after Jenner had been helped off and Snow was walking back to his mark instead of having a quiet word in the interim. Snow thought this inflamed the crowd who had just calmed down after the incident itself. When they started throwing beer-cans and food onto the ground Illingworth took his team back to the dressing room when the umpires refused to do so, an unprecedented move in Test cricket.\nRun outs.\nThere were two run out incidents. In the First Test Keith Stackpole should have been run out for 18 as Geoff Boycott threw down the wicket at the bowler's end, but the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt by Lou Rowan. The Australian papers carried photographs the next day showing that he was clearly out and labelled the decision \"one of the worst in cricket history\". It probably cost England victory as Stackpole made 207 – his highest Test score – and if the \"extra\" 189 runs are subtracted England would have won by an innings (464 to Australia's 244 &amp; 214). Rowan's refusal to accept that his decision was wrong gave the England players grave doubts as to his ability and led them to question his judgements for the remainder of the series. Boycott was particularly upset with the decision, but in the Sixth Test he was even angrier when Umpire O'Connell gave him out. Ian Chappell had thrown down the stumps as Boycott failed to ground his bat finishing a run. He vocally disputed his dismissal and later pointedly refused to apologise for his behaviour, which led to another press furore especially as a photograph showed that he was clearly out. Boycott later apologised to Umpire O'Connell in private.\nCatches and stumpings.\nIn the Fifth Test Max O'Connell called \"over\" and turned to walk to square leg after Snow bowled the last ball of the first over. As a result he missed Alan Knott catching Keith Stackpole and had to give him not out. This was his first over as an umpire in Test cricket and Snow 'could quite understand his actions which illustrate the pressure umpires are also under in a Test', and they were able to joke about it afterwards. In the Seventh Test Walters had to be stumped twice by Knott off Underwood as he was given not out by Rowan the first time when for 41, but was a few balls later by Max O'Connell on 42. Later in the match Keith Stackpole was caught off a thick edge by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out by Rowan, Illingworth said the decision \"was really unbelievable\".\nLeg before wicket.\nNo Australian batsman was given out leg before wicket in the entire series, the clearest evidence of umpiring bias in the minds of the England players. Again Keith Stackpole benefited, in the Second Test he survived lbw appeals from Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever before he was out caught by Lever off Snow for 8. There was an experimental lbw law in force at the time which made it more difficult to dismiss batsmen, particularly for spin bowlers. In any case five England batsmen were given out lbw in the series."

UVM is the only NCAA program in history to count alumni who have won both the Hart Trophy and the Vezina Trophy, as well as the only NCAA program to generate an Art Ross winner.\nA two-time Olympian in 1998 and 2002, LeClair was elected to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009 after a standout 16-year NHL career where he scored 406 goals. He was a two-time NHL first team All-Star and twice won the Bud Light Plus/Minus Award. LeClair is the only American born player to record three consecutive 50 goal seasons, and is the only NHL player with back to back game winning SCF OT goals.\nOther Catamounts who were U.S. Olympians were Thomas (2010), former NHL defenseman Aaron Miller (2002, 2006) and Ryan Gunderson (2018). St. Louis skated for Canada in the 2006 and 2014 Olympics, while Sharp was named to Canada's 2014 Olympic squad. Viktor Stalberg also represented Sweden at the 2018 Olympics.

Martin Adams was the defending men's champion, having won the title for the second time in the previous year's final against Dave Chisnall.\nAdams became the first to successfully defend his BDO title since Raymond van Barneveld in 1999, as he beat Dean Winstanley, who is one of only a handful of players to reach the final at their first attempt. The final score was 7–5 in sets which saw Martin Adams retain the championship. Trina Gulliver successfully defended her Women's world title having beaten Rhian Edwards in a repeat of the 2010 final. It was Gulliver's ninth title.\nArguably the two standout matches of the tournament were Adams's victory over John Walton in the second round - the match going all the way to a sudden death leg - and Jan Dekker's comeback victory over Garry Thompson which was reminiscent of Chris Mason's comeback against Adams twelve years earlier (much like Adams in that match, Thompson missed nine darts at double to reach the semi-final).\nPlayers from around the globe competed to reach the BBC televised finals, which run from 1–9 January at Frimley Green.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nMen's.\nThe televised stages featured 32 players. The top 16 players in the Lakeside Table over the 2009/10 season were seeded for the tournament. Other places were made up of other qualifiers from the Lakeside Table, a number of qualifying spaces from the International Qualifiers (held in Hull on 28 October), and spaces for the 2008 &amp; 2009 champions and 2010 semi-finalists if not already qualified and still eligible for the tournament. The draw took place on 12 November.\nFor the first time since the tournament's inception Australia was a notable absentee without any players involved. \nThis left England and Scotland as the only countries to be represented in each BDO World Championship since the very beginning.\nWomen's.\nThe televised stages featured 8 players. The top 4 players in the Lakeside Table over the 2009/10 season will be seeded for the tournament. Other places were made up of other qualifiers from the Lakeside Table, a number of qualifying spaces from the International Qualifiers ( held in Hull on 28 October), and spaces for the 2008 &amp; 2009 champions and 2010 finalists if not already qualified and eligibled for the tournament. The draw took place on 12 November.\nPrize money.\nThere was also a shared 9 Dart Checkout prize of £52,000, along with a High Checkout prize of £3000.\nThe total prize fund was £329,000 – a £4000 increase on last year. All levels of prize money remained the same as 2010 (except for the Ladies winner).\nTelevision coverage.\nThe tournament was again broadcast by BBC Sport, who have done so every year since its inception. Colin Murray reprised his role as host, after taking over from Ray Stubbs in 2010, Bobby George was again the main pundit, hosting with Colin Murray for live and afternoon coverage sometimes joining Rob Walker for the highlight shows, Bobby George has been the BBC main darts pundit since the early 2000s. Rob Walker, the Master of Ceremonies at BBC's snooker events and host of the BBC's 2009 Winmau World Masters continued to present the late night highlights and \"Darts Extra\" through the night on BBC2.\nThe commentary team was headed by David Croft, who has been commentating for the BBC since 2003 and Vassos Alexander, making his Lakeside debut covering for the ill Tony Green. Guest commentators included Martin Adams and Tony O'Shea.\nMost of the weekend coverage was shown live on either BBC One or BBC Two, included both semi finals and the final itself. All other matches were shown live via the BBC's interactive coverage on its Red Button service."

        "title": "Swimming-induced pulmonary edema",
        "text": "Swimming induced pulmonary edema (SIPE), also known as immersion pulmonary edema, is a life threatening condition that occurs when fluids from the blood leak abnormally from the small vessels of the lung (pulmonary capillaries) into the airspaces (alveoli).\nSIPE usually occurs during exertion in conditions of water immersion, such as swimming and diving. With the recent surge in popularity of triathlons and swimming in open water events there has been an increasing incidence of SIPE. It has been reported in scuba divers, apnea (breath hold) free-diving competitors, combat swimmers, and triathletes. The causes are incompletely understood as of 2010. Some authors believe that SIPE may be the leading cause of death among recreational scuba divers, but there is insufficient evidence at present.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAs with other forms of pulmonary edema, the hallmark of SIPE is a cough which may lead to frothy or blood-tinged sputum. Symptoms include:\nRisk factors.\nIt has been described in scuba divers, long-distance swimmers, and breath-hold divers.\nMechanism.\nImmersion causes increased external hydrostatic pressure, leading to redistribution of blood from the periphery to the chest, which increases cardiac filling pressures and stroke volume, and also reduces total lung capacity. There is a movement of fluid from the alveolar capillaries into the alveoli and extravascular lung tissues, which increases with time, and is normal in healthy humans when immersed. This is normally counteracted by the release of BNP which causes sodium and water excretion through the kidneys. This natriuresis is slow, so lung water increase is to some extent normal, but in susceptible people a higher rate of accumulation produces symptoms of SIPE\nThe alveoli of the lungs fill with edema fluid, causing dyspnoea, cough and frothy or bloodstained sputum. Gas exchange is affected, and as hypoxia increases there may be a loss of consciousness. Oxygenation in divers may be affected by breathing gas mix and partial pressure reduction due to ascent. In severe cases hypoxia may cause cardiac arrest and death. Research continues into the various factors causing IPO.\nPossible aggravating factors include:\nSIPE is believed to arise from some combinations of these factors, which overwhelms the ability of the body to compensate, and leads to alveolar flooding.\nDiagnosis.\nAcute onset of breathing problems caused by fluid accumulation in lung extravascular spaces induced by immersion, usually in cold water, often with intense physical exertion. Symptoms reported developed during physical activity and usually include dyspnoea/shortness of breath and a cough, often haemoptysis, occasionally chest tightness, chest pain or confusion. Auscultation shows crackles or wheezing. Oxygen saturation usually shows hypoxemia. In most cases chest radiological examination shows signs of pulmonary edema, but a significant minority have a normal initial chest X-Ray. \nRapid resolution of initial signs and symptoms within 48 hours is typical. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously after the physiologic environment has been normalised by removal from immersion to a warm environment, with supportive treatment.\nManagement.\nManagement has generally been reported to be conservative, though deaths have been reported.\nPrognosis.\nThe majority of cases rapidly resolve symptoms within 48 hours.\nThere is a significant risk of further episodes under similar conditions. Investigation for other cardiac problems is indicated. In some cases a medical condition predisposing to SIPE can be corrected, and in some other cases divers who have had SIPE have resumed diving against medical advice.\nEpidemiology.\nSIPE is estimated to occur in 1-2% of competitive open-water swimmers, with 1.4% of triathletes, 1.8% of combat swimmers and 1.1% of divers and swimmers reported in the literature. Fatal cases can be mistaken for drowning because in both SIPE and drowning the lungs are heavy and filled with fluid, so post mortem findings may be similar. Consequently, most information about this condition comes from survivors and the true incidence is uncertain and likely to be underreported.\nResearch.\nMost of the medical literature on the topic comes from case series in military populations and divers, and an epidemiological study in triathletes. A recent experimental study showed increased pulmonary artery pressure with cold water immersion, but this was done in normal subjects rather than in people with a history of SIPE. A study in SIPE-susceptible individuals during submersion in cold water showed that pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressures were higher than in non-susceptible people. These pressures were reduced by Sildenafil. SIPE may also be a cause of death during triathlons."

        "text": "Joe Lombardi (born November 7, 1959) is an American basketball coach currently the head coach for the Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) Crimson Hawks of Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference in NCAA Division II. Prior to taking the head coaching position at IUP, Lombardi served as an assistant coach, including a nine-year tenure at La Salle University and three season under Jamie Dixon at the University of Pittsburgh. In his fourth season with the Crimson Hawks in 2009–10, Lombardi led the team to the 2010 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship where they were defeated by the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos. Following the season, Lomardi was named as the 2010 \"Basketball Times\" Division II National Coach of the Year.\nEarly life and playing career.\nLombardi was raised in Sharon, Pennsylvania. He played high school basketball at Kennedy Christian High School in Hermitage, Pennsylvania. He attended Youngstown State University from 1977 to 1981, where he was a four-time letterman in basketball, and served as team captain his final two seasons. He graduated with honors and a degree in education.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from Youngstown State, Lombardi served as a graduate assistant coach under Danny Nee at Ohio University during the 1981–82 season. The following season, he served as a part-time assistant at Youngstown State. In 1984 he was appointed a full-time assistant at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), where he served for three seasons.\nFollowing his stint at IUP, Lombardi served as an assistant to Jim Baron at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1992. During Lombardi's time at Saint Francis, the Red Flash had two of their best seasons in 20 years. During the 1990–91 season, the Red Flash recorded a 24–8 record, won the Northeast Conference and earned the school's first appearance in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship as a #15 seed. Also at Saint Francis, Lombardi guided Mike Iuzzolino, who was selected 35th overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1991 NBA draft.\nAfter his five-year tenure at Saint Francis, Lombardi served for nine seasons at St. Bonaventure University, including as associate head coach from 1996 to 2001. In 2000 the Bonnies went 21–10, made the Atlantic 10 final and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The Bonnies also appeared in the National Invitational Tournament in 1995, 1998 and 2001. At St. Bonaventure, Lombardi was responsible for recruiting J.R. Bremer, who was a National Basketball Association All-Rookie second team selection in 2002.\nBetween 2001 and 2003 Lombardi served as an assistant at La Salle University under coach Bill Hahn. With the Explorers, Lombardi coached second-round Miami Heat draft pick Rasual Butler and helped revive the university's program.\nIn 2003, Lombardi joined the University of Pittsburgh staff under head coach Jamie Dixon. Lombardi was primarily focused on recruiting, scouting opponents, and player development. During his time at Pitt, the Panthers amassed a 76–22 record, played in the Big East Championship game in 2004 and 2005, and advanced to their third consecutive Sweet Sixteen in 2004. While with the Panthers, Lombardi was responsible for recruiting Gilbert Brown and Sam Young, who was a 2009 All-American and a 2009 second-round selection by the Memphis Grizzlies.\nIn April 2006, Lombardi was named the head coach at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The Crimson Hawks compete in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference of NCAA Division II. Lombardi previously served as an assistant under Tom Beck for three seasons with IUP between 1984 and 1987.\nIn 2007, before the start of Lombardi's second season, the basketball team, as well as IUP's swimming team, was placed on probation by the NCAA for violations committed by his predecessor between 2000 and 2006. As a result, the basketball team had forfeited two athletic scholarships for the previous season, and Lombardi and his assistants were permitted a limited number of recruiting days away from campus.\nIn his first season, the team went 6–21, and improved to 13–15 during the next season. In 2008, the team returned to the PSAC Tournament. Lombardi continued to be successful in recruiting, coaching three consecutive PSAC West Freshman of the Year between 2006 and 2009. In 2008–09 the Crimson Hawks went 22–8 and returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005, and the first time under Lombardi.

        "title": "Baseball in Venezuela",
        "text": "Baseball is Venezuela's leading sport.\nHistory.\nBaseball in Venezuela originates with the early twentieth century cultural influence of United States oil companies, introduced in the country at the end of the 1910s and at the beginning of the 1920s by American immigrants and workers from the exploding oil industry in the country.\nBaseball's definitive explosion in Venezuela was in 1941, the year of the Baseball World Cup in Havana when the national team beat Cuba in the finals. This team was consecrated by the press and the fans as \"Los Héroes del '41\" (The Heroes of '41). Since that year, baseball has transformed into the nation's most popular sport, a status it enjoys till today. Buoyed by this success, the sport took on a life on its own, and in 1945, the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (VPBL) was established as the country's primary baseball league.\nThe VPBL is a winter league that was established in 1945, with Leones del Caracas the leading team; another leading club is Valencia's Navegantes del Magallanes, established in 1917. There are currently 8 teams in the league. There is a Venezuelan Summer League established in 1997 and composed of teams affiliated with Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs. The Liga paralela is a secondary Venezuelan winter league, with the teams acting as farm teams for VPBL clubs. In 2021, the Venezuelan Major League, a summer league circuit, was launched.\nVenezuelan teams have won the Caribbean Series a number of times. The Venezuela national baseball team won the Baseball World Cup several times in the 1940s, and the baseball tournament at the Pan American Games in 1959. The team finished 7th in the inaugural World Baseball Classic and 3rd in the 2009 event, but has dropped to 10th in the 2013 event.\nOver 350 Venezuelans have played in Major League Baseball since 1939, with 59 Venezuelans playing in MLB as of Opening Day 2014, the second most from any country (after the Dominican Republic). The Luis Aparicio Award was established in 2004, in honor of Luis Aparicio, the only Venezuelan ballplayer to have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The award is given annually to honor the Venezuelan player who recorded the best individual performance in Major League Baseball, as voted on by sports journalists in Venezuela.\nSix MLB teams maintained training academies in Venezuela in 2010, down from 21 in 2002. Possible reasons for the decline include strained relations between the U.S. and Venezuela and the increasingly ubiquitous presence of MLB teams in the country creating more competition for talent there.\nIn November 2011 Washington Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos was kidnapped while home to play for his Venezuelan winter league team, Tigres de Aragua. Two days later he was rescued unharmed by police commandos in the mountains of Carabobo state. Eight people were arrested in connection with the kidnapping.\nOut of the 50 players involved in the 2012 Major League Baseball World Series, 9 were Venezuelan.\nInternational Free Agency in Venezuela\nThe morality of the international free agency process in nations such as Venezuela is often questioned due to various reasons. Money-hungry agents prey on naive and underprivileged latino baseball players in attempts to pocket as much of their signing bonuses as possible. As a result of this exploitation, many opt to attend baseball academies rather than school, which leaves them without education. These academies are often very low quality, with their main purpose being to hide players that are too young to officially sign from other teams that are scouting talent in the same area. \nPlayers are led on by these teams by being promised free visas, even though they do not have enough to fulfill all of the promises they make. Organizations and agents often crush the dreams of these baseball players through false promises and exploitation, and get away with these acts due to the lack of regulation and laws surrounding the exploitation of young athletes. Major League Baseball is aware of this issue, however due to the current system providing the league with cheaper talent, there is no urgency to resolve any existing issues. "

All schools are members of other conferences in other sports. WILA was formed at the beginning of the 2010–2011 academic year in order to name a champion (which does not involve a tournament), players of the week, and an all-league team at the end of the season. With no automatic qualifiers (AQ) currently in NCAA Division II men's lacrosse, conferences play a different role than in Division III.\nThe WILA is a loose confederation that not only assures games for its members, but also hopes to act as a catalyst for other NCAA Division II institutions looking to make a move to varsity lacrosse and eyeing stability. \"It's what you need to do in non-traditional areas,\" said Notre Dame de Namur men's lacrosse coach Steve Dini. The WILA schedule features home-and-home contests with all schools. The 2010–2011 season included Adams State, Fort Lewis, Colorado Mesa and Regis competing in women's lacrosse, while Adams State, Dominican, Grand Canyon, Colorado Mesa and Notre Dame de Namur competed in men's lacrosse.\nLindenwood University joins the conference beginning with the 2011–2012 academic year with both men's and women's teams. They replaced Grand Canyon University, which left the conference at the end of the 2010–2011 season, after the university announced that their program would compete at the club level in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association. The WILA concluded its second season in April 2012. Colorado Mesa won the association's men's championship with a conference record of 6-2; the championship was the first for Colorado Mesa in the program's second year of NCAA lacrosse competition. On the women's side, Lindenwood won the 2012 WILA women's lacrosse championship in the program's first season of NCAA competition. The Lady Lions recorded an 8-0 conference record en route to the title. The season saw additional membership changes when Lindenwood announced its men's program would join the new ECAC Division II Lacrosse League starting in the 2012–2013 academic year. The announcement was followed a week later by the addition of McKendree University's new women's lacrosse program starting in the 2012–2013 academic year.\nMen's lacrosse was added as an official Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference sport starting in the 2015–2016 school year, essentially absorbing the WILA. Adams State, Colorado Mesa, and Colorado State–Pueblo are full members of the RMAC and is joined by Rockhurst as an affiliate member.\nMember schools.\nMembership timeline.\n "

Charles Francis Adams III was the skipper of Resolute in this race.\nDespite being disabled in the first race and losing the second, \"Resolute\" won the final three races and in doing so retained the Cup on behalf of the NYYC, continuing the club's unbroken record of defending the America's Cup.\nThe 1920 America's Cup was originally scheduled to take place in 1914 but was postponed upon the outbreak of World War I.\nThe 13th Cup challenge was the last to take place in New York, and the first held under the Universal Rule of measurement. Due to the rule, Shamrock IV owed Resolute seven minutes time.\nLipton challenges a fourth time.\nFollowing his unsuccessful Cup challenge in 1903, Lipton, founder of the Lipton tea company, attempted to persuade the NYYC to adopt new rules of measurement for America's Cup yachts that would reduce their cost, which was widely seen to be a result of the Seawanhaka rule then used by the club. Despite the NYYC having adopted the new Universal Rule in 1903, formulated by Nathaniel Herreshoff, for its own races, it was reluctant to allow its use for America's Cup races and refused several challenges issued by Lipton until finally accepting in 1913.\nTrials.\nThe 1914 defender selection trials pitted \"Resolute\" against \"Vanitie\". In winning, \"Resolute\" set a course record. The races were suspended as World War I broke out and did not resume until 1920, at which point \"Resolute\" again secured her place as defender in trials against \"Vanitie\".\nRace.\nThe American defender \"Resolute\" won 3–2 against the challenger \"Shamrock IV\".\nDuring the first race, Shamrock IV crossed the line ahead of the start, having to circle back around and provide an early lead to Resolute. However, later in the race the shackle holding Resolute's mainsail broke, forcing the boat to complete the race only under jib. This provided Lipton with his first America's Cup victory, although he refused to celebrate the win.\nThe second race was without incident and Shamrock IV won by a corrected two minutes ahead of Resolute.\nThe following three races were under lighter conditions, which disadvantaged Shamrock IV and allowed Resolute to win. Police estimated that over 75,000 people watched the final race.\nThe course for the race was laid out by Lewis Blix."

        "text": "Ceylonese Rugby &amp; Football Club, also known as CR &amp; FC, is a Division-A rugby union team based in Colombo, Sri Lanka which plays in the Dialog Rugby League. Established in 1922, the club has won the Clifford Cup Knockout Tournament fifteen times, most recently in 2023. Their nickname is the Red Shirts.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on 25 September 1922 by Colonel Ernest Henley Joseph. It was the first rugby-only sporting organisation in the country at the time. It had its roots in the Nondescripts Cricket Club (NCC), and depended on NCC and Havelock Sports Club for practices and matches during its first four years. Supporters called them the Red Shirts because of their uniform and club colours.\nProminent figures in Sri Lankan society participated in the committee at the inaugural Annual General Meeting in 1923, including members of the Schokman, Rockwood, Saravanamutthu, Weinman, and Ondatjie families. The first captain was L. O. Weinman, and the vice-captain was Rajah Hewavitharana.\nAfter World War I, the Clifford Cup was re-introduced and the CR &amp; FC lost to the United Services team 3-6. The club flourished over the next few decades, with boys from Trinity College, Royal College, Zahira College, St Peter's College, St Thomas' College, and subsequently Isipathana College representing it with distinction. A new clubhouse was opened in December 1964, and the main gate was opened in 1965.\nThe club also maintains a senior Men's Rugby Union team. Features for members include a billiard room, squash courts, lighted tennis courts, a gymnasium, a swimming pool and an indoor badminton court. CR &amp; FC has had a number of its players play for the Sri Lanka national rugby union team.\nColours and name.\nThe club colours are those of the Ceylon Artillery Volunteer Corps, which was commanded by Col. Joseph. He insisted that the club colours should be the artillery red and blue, and subsequently persuaded the general committee.\nStadium.\nThe club's home ground is CR &amp; FC Grounds. On 29 June 2007 a new pavilion was opened by its primary sponsors, Football Federation of Sri Lanka president Hurley Silveira and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation CEO David Griffiths. The new building includes a 500-seat viewing deck, six corporate boxes, two dressing rooms, an outside bar for members and guests, a bar for members, and a restaurant for members and guests.\nGeneral committee (2021–22).\nPast presidents include:\nHonours.\nThe club was the 2013 Plate and Shield Champion in the SLRFU Sevens Tournament. In 2007 it was a runner-up in the Caltex League Tournament, and in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010 it was a runner-up in the Dialog Rugby League. The club was a runner-up in the 2008 Clifford Cup and the winner in 1954–1959, 1964–1966, 1987–1989, 2006 and 2023. It was also the champion of the President's Trophy Knockout Tournament in 1977, 1983, 1990–1994 and 2007."

        "text": "The men's foil was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1960 Summer Olympics programme. It was the thirteenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 29 – 30 August 1960. 78 fencers from 31 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Viktor Zhdanovich of the Soviet Union, with his countryman Yury Sisikin the runner-up; they were the nation's first medals in the event. The Soviets nearly swept the medals, with Mark Midler advancing to a three-man barrage for third place before finishing in fifth place. Albie Axelrod's bronze put the United States on the podium for the event for the first time since 1932. Traditional powers Italy and France, who between them had won 11 of 12 gold medals and 9 of 12 silver, were kept off the podium entirely (and Italy did not even have a fencer made the final).\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Three of the eight finalists from 1956 returned: two-time gold medalist (and 1948 silver medalist) Christian d'Oriola of France, fourth-place finisher Allan Jay of Great Britain, and seventh-place finisher Mark Midler of the Soviet Union. D'Oriola was a strong contender for a third gold medal, but the Italian and French hegemony in the event was threatened by rising strength of other nations. Jay was the reigning world champion. The Soviets had won the team event at the world championships.\nMonaco, Morocco, New Zealand, Tunisia, and Vietnam each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its 12th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a pool play format, with each fencer facing the other fencers in the pool in a round robin. Bouts were to 5 touches. It is unclear how ties were broken in the first round; beginning in round 2, barrages were used to break ties necessary for advancement. However, only as much fencing was done as was necessary to determine advancement, so some bouts never occurred if the fencers advancing from the pool could be determined. The competition involved 5 rounds:\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced.\nRound 1 Pool I.\nSaev of Bulgaria did not start, leaving this pool with only 5 fencers.\nRound 2.\nRound 2 Pool A.\nThe fifth (final) round of the pool was cancelled entirely, as it was clear who the four advancing would be; each fencer thus faced only 4 others.\nRound 2 Pool F.\nThere was a 4-way tie for 3rd place, requiring a barrage for the last two advancement places.\nQuarterfinals.\nQuarterfinal A.\nThere was a four-way tie for 3rd place; a barrage was held to determine the final advancing fencer.\nQuarterfinal B.\nCarpaneda and d'Oriola tied for the 3rd and final advancement place at 3–2, so fenced off for the spot. Carpaneda had won the initial round-robin bout, but d'Oriola won the fence-off and advanced.\nQuarterfinal D.\nWith a three-way tie for 2nd place, a barrage was needed to determine two advancement spots.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal A.\nIn a very closely contested semifinal, each fencer finished either 3–2 or 2–3. With a three-way tie for 4th place, a barrage was needed to determine the final advancement spot.\nSemifinal B.\nHoskyns and Różycki tied for 4th at 2–3. In the barrage, Hoskyns was victorious, repeating his 5–1 win over Różycki in the round-robin.\nFinal.\nAfter a 3–2 record in the semifinals, Zhdanovich swept the entire field in the final and finished 7–0 for the gold medal. The next closest fencer and thus silver medalist, Sisikin, went 4–2. Closset dislocated his right knee and was unable to finish the round; his bouts against Sisikin, Axelrod, and Woyda were cancelled. The three men tied for third place at 3 wins (regardless of losses, which were different due to Closset's injury) faced off in a barrage for the bronze medal; Axelrod won by beating both of the other hopefuls. Despite only competing in four bouts, Closset finished in a tie for 6th at 2 wins (he was 2–2 in his bouts), winning the tie-breaker against Hoskyns (2–5) based on touches received in their respective victories: Closset's wins were both by 5–3 scores, for a total of 6 touches received, while Hoskyns's wins were by 5–4 scores, with a total of 8 touches received)."

There were significant changes from previous tournaments, however. The competition expanded to five rounds for the first time. Bouts were to 5 touches (an innovation retained from 1956), except that now (for the first time) ties were not permitted so that double-touches for the 5th and subsequent points resulted in the match continuing until one fencer won a point. Barrages were used to break ties necessary for advancement. However, only as much fencing was done as was necessary to determine advancement, so some bouts never occurred if the fencers advancing from the pool could be determined. Byes for team event finalists were eliminated; all fencers started in the first round. The competition involved 5 rounds:\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced.\nRound 1 Pool A.\nWith Gonsior and Echeverry tied for 3rd place at 3–2, the two men fenced each other again for the right to advance. Echeverry had won the initial bout between the two in pool play, but Gonsior won the rematch 5–4 and advanced to the next round along with Guittet and Pickworth.\nRound 1 Pool B.\nVasin of Yugoslavia was entered in this pool, but did not start. The bout between Sákovics and Achten was cancelled as unnecessary.\nRound 1 Pool D.\nThe Kausz–Martínez and Saykali–Ramos bouts were cancelled; neither could affect qualification.\nRound 1 Pool E.\nWith a three-way tie for 3rd place, a barrage was conducted to assign the final advancement place. In the initial pool play, the three tied fencers had each gone 1–1 against the others (Dehez beat Spinella, who beat Pakarinen, who beat Dehez). In the barrage, Dehez again defeated Spinella, though it was a closer match the second time. Dehez then also beat Pakarinen to avenge his group loss. Because the two victories for Dehez ensured his qualification over the other two fencers, Spinella and Pakarinen did not face each other in the barrage.\nRound 1 Pool F.\nThree bouts were cancelled as they would not affect qualification.\nRound 1 Pool G.\nThere was a three-way tie for 2nd place, so a barrage was held to determine the two fencers who would advance along with the leader, Jay. Annabi lost each of the first two bouts of the barrage, making the third bout unnecessary.\nRound 1 Pool H.\nGruber of Venezuela was entered in this pool but withdrew before competition began. After a three-way tie for 3rd place in the round-robin, a barrage was held. Neuber defeated both Dwinger and Fujimaki to guarantee his advancement; the latter two did not fence each other. \nRound 1 Pool I.\nThe Kostava–Wiik bout was cancelled as unnecessary; both fencers would advance regardless of the result. Similarly, the Ramadan–Roldán and Soeratman–Díez bouts would not have given any of those fencers enough wins to reach 3rd place and were cancelled.\nRound 1 Pool J.\nGlos and Margolis tied for 3rd and fenced off; Margolis had won the initial bout, but Glos was the victor in the barrage and earned advancement to the next round.\nRound 1 Pool K.\nThere was a three-way tie for 3rd, requiring a barrage. Hoskyns won the first two bouts against Theisen and Stone, making the third bout between those two fencers irrelevant.\nRound 1 Pool L.\nAbrahamsson and Almada tied for 3rd and fenced off; Abrahamsson repeated his round-robin victory over Almada to advance to the next round. The bout between Mouyal and Gábor was cancelled as unnecessary.\nRound 2.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced.\nRound 2 Pool A.\nThe Guittet–Breda bout was unnecessary and not fenced.\nRound 2 Pool B.\nTwo bouts (Sákovics–Glos and Pellegrino–Pickworth) were cancelled as unnecessary to determine advancement.\nRound 2 Pool C.\nTwo bouts (Abrahamsson–Kostava and Delfino–Dehez) were cancelled as unnecessary for determining advancement.\nRound 2 Pool D.\nThe Rehbinder–Fernandes bout was cancelled as unnecessary for determining advancement. Dreyfus and Wiik each finished at 2–3; the Official Report does not mention a barrage or how the tie between the two for 4th place was otherwise broken.\nRound 2 Pool E.\nThe Habārovs–Gnaier and Pelling–Gutenkauf bouts were cancelled as unnecessary for determining advancement.\nRound 2 Pool F.\nAmez-Droz and Mouyal tied for 4th at 2–3 and fenced off in a barrage for advancement. Mouyal, who had won the round-robin bout against Amez-Droz, won again in the barrage.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced.\nQuarterfinal A.\nThere was a three-way tie for 2nd place, resulting in a barrage for the 2 available advancement spots. Kurczab lost both of the first two bouts, rendering the third bout (between Habārovs and Jay) unnecessary.\nQuarterfinal B.\nThe Dreyfus–Kostava bout was cancelled as unnecessary to determining advancement.\nQuarterfinal C.\nThe Glos–Guittet bout was cancelled as unnecessary to determining advancement.\nQuarterfinal D.\nThere was a four-way tie for 1st place, so a barrage was needed between those four fencers to determine the three who would advance. Chernushevich lost to all three of the other fencers, making him the one from the barrage not to advance.\nSemifinals.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced.\nSemifinal A.\nAchten and Pellegrino tied at 2–3 and had to fence-off. Pellegrino had won the round-robin bout, but Achten won the barrage.\nSemifinal B.\nThere was a three-way tie for 4th place, necessitating a barrage for the last advancement place. When the three fencers again tied at 1–1, they were ranked by fewest touches received, giving Breda the victory within the barrage.\nFinal.\nThe final pool resulted in 3 sets of ties: Delfino and Jay at 5–2 for gold and silver, Habārovs and Sákovics at 4–3 for bronze and 4th place, and Achten, Dreyfus, and Mouyal at 3–4 for 5th through 7th place. The medal ties were broken via barrage. Delfino, who had defeated Jay 6–5 in the round-robin, defeated him again 5–2 in the barrage to take the gold medal. Both bouts between Habārovs and Sákovics went past five touches due to double-hits; Sákovics won in the round-robin 7–6, but Habārovs prevailed in the barrage 8–7.\nThe three-way tie for 5th, 6th, and 7th places was broken not by a barrage, but by tie-breakers within the round-robin results. The fencer with the fewest touches received in victories was ranked best; this was Achten (to take 5th place), whose wins had been 5–1, 5–3, and 5–4 (8 touches received). Dreyfus and Mouyal each had received 9 touches in their victories (Dreyfus won by 6–5, 5–1, and 5–3 scores; all three of Mouyal's victories were 5–3). The next tie-breaker was touches given in losses. Dreyfus here prevailed, taking 6th place; he had scored 2, 5, 4, and 3 touches (14 total) in his losses, while Mouyal had given 5, 2, 2, and 1 (10 total) in his."

The competition was held from 7 to 8 September 1960. 70 fencers from 29 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Rudolf Kárpáti, the eighth of nine straight Games in which a Hungarian would win the event. Kárpáti was the second man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the men's sabre (Jenő Fuchs in 1908 and 1912) and fifth to win multiple medals of any color. His teammate Zoltán Horváth took silver while Wladimiro Calarese of Italy finished with the bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Five of the eight finalists from 1956 returned: gold medalist Rudolf Kárpáti of Hungary, silver medalist Jerzy Pawłowski of Poland (who, in 1968, would finally break the Hungarian run of nine straight gold medals in the event), fourth-place finisher Jacques Lefèvre of France, fifth-place finisher (and three-time medalist, with bronze in 1936, gold in 1948, and silver in 1952) Aladár Gerevich of Hungary, and sixth-place finisher Wojciech Zabłocki of Poland. The three world champions since the last Olympics were Pawłowski (1957), Yakov Rylsky of the Soviet Union (1958), and Kárpáti (1959).\nIsrael, Morocco, New Zealand, Tunisia, and Vietnam each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 12th appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 St. Louis Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a pool play format, with each fencer facing the other fencers in the pool in a round robin.

        "text": "The FEI World Cup Dressage Final is an annual international dressage series involving the world's best dressage horses and riders. It has been held since 1985. The World Cup is run in the form of a CDI.\nHistory.\nThe history of the World Cup Dressage Final is closely connected to the history of the Grand Prix Freestyle. In 1984 Joep Bartels (former rider, husband of Tineke Bartels and father of Imke Schellekens-Bartels) saw Reiner Klimke and \"Ahlerich\" perform the one tempi changes to John Williams' Olympic Fanfare at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Inspired by this, he thought of a freestyle dressage competition.\nOne year later, the first World Cup Dressage Final was held. Each qualifier for the World Cup Final, which is held at the end of each season, consists of two competitions (Grand Prix de Dressage and Grand Prix Freestyle). From 1985 to 2001 both competitions counted for the qualifier results, which were part of the world cup ranking for this season. Since 2002, only the Grand Prix Freestyle has counted for the world cup ranking.\nFrom 1985 to 2004 Joep Bartels was the director of the World Cup Dressage Final.\nReem Acra was the World Cup Dressage Final title sponsor from the season 2010/2011 to 2015.\nQualification to the World Cup final.\nRiders, who will be part of the World Cup Dressage Final, have two options to qualify for this event.\nThe first option is, to qualify oneself by one World Cup league. There are four Dressage World Cup leagues:\nGenerally, only three participants per nation are allowed to participate in the World Cup final.\nIn addition, the FEI awards two extra starting places to riders that have not qualified for the World Cup finals. Unused starting places can also be allocated by the FEI as extra starting places.\nTo participate with a horse in the World Cup final, a rider (which starts in one of the leagues) has to start with this horse in two World Cup qualifiers. In this competition, the rider has to complete the competition with at least 68.000%.\nThe title holder is automatically qualified for the World Cup final, but he/she must also qualify his horse in the above called way. If he/she starts in a qualifier, he/she is not considered in the scoring (scoring points) of this event.\nAllocation of scoring points.\nThe scoring of the league is set only for the European leagues by the FEI. The North American and the Pacific Leagues have their own regulations.\nEuropean leagues.\nIn the European leagues the number of scoring points of each rider decide on the qualification of the rider for the World Cup final. The points are awarded in the Grand Prix Freestyle according to the following system:\nIf the 15th rank awarded several times, all riders of this rank will get 2 scoring points.\nNorth American League.\nIn the North American League each rider has to start in two qualifiers to have the chance to start in the World Cup final. The best two Grand Prix Freestyle results of each rider by World Cup qualifiers are added and then divided by two. The two riders with the best scoring of this procedure are qualified for the World Cup final.\nPacific League.\nThe Pacific League has no scoring ranking. Riders, who have to complete a Grand Prix Freestyle competition at a CDI 3* or CDI-W in the Pacific League region with at least 62.000%, have the chance to start at the Pacific League final. This league final is held between December and February in Australia or New Zealand. The winner of this league final are qualified for the World Cup final.\nWorld Cup final.\nThe World Cup final is held at the end of each Dressage World Cup season in March or April. The first competition of the final is the Grand Prix de Dressage, the winner of the second competition of the final (the Grand Prix Freestyle) is the winner of this World Cup season."

        "title": "2013 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2013 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the 58th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 21st season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League.\nThe match took place on Saturday, 25 May 2013, at Wembley Stadium in London, England, between German Bundesliga clubs Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. In the first all-German Champions League final, Bayern won the match 2–1 with goals from Mario Mandžukić and man of the match Arjen Robben coming either side of an İlkay Gündoğan penalty for Dortmund.\nOne week later, Bayern won the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal and, having already won the 2012–13 Bundesliga, completed the continental treble. As a result of their Champions League win, Bayern qualified to play against Chelsea, the winners of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, in the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, and also earned the right to enter the semi-finals of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative. They would eventually go on to win both competitions.\nA viewership of 21.6 million on the German ZDF and over 360 million worldwide has been reported, making it the most watched sports broadcast of 2013.\nVenue.\nWembley Stadium, England's national stadium and home of the England national football team, was announced as the venue of the 2013 final on 16 June 2011. Having hosted the 2011 final, Wembley made history for being the first stadium in the tournament's history to host the final twice in three years. Discussing the short time between the two finals, UEFA President Michel Platini explained that the final would be in celebration of 150 years of the Football Association's existence. It was the seventh occasion that Wembley hosted the final after hosting the 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978, 1992 and the 2011 finals of Europe's premier club competition.\nThe original Wembley Stadium hosted five European Cup finals. The 1968 and 1978 finals were both won by English sides: Manchester United beat Benfica 4–1 in 1968 and Liverpool defeated Club Brugge 1–0 in 1978. Benfica also lost in the 1963 final, beaten 2–1 by A.C. Milan, while Ajax won the first of three consecutive European Cups at Wembley in 1971, beating Panathinaikos 2–0. In the 1992 final, Spanish club Barcelona defeated Italian side Sampdoria 1–0 in the final match played as the European Cup prior to the following season's introduction of the current Champions League format.\nFirst opened for the British Empire Exhibition in 1923, the stadium was originally known as the Empire Stadium. That year, it hosted its first FA Cup Final, when almost 200,000 spectators attempted to watch the match between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United. Wembley played host to all of England's matches at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, including the 4–2 victory over West Germany in the final, and at UEFA Euro 1996. The original stadium was closed in 2000 and demolished three years later, to be replaced by a 90,000-capacity stadium, which opened in 2007. The new stadium hosted the 2011 UEFA Champions League final, which pitted Barcelona against Manchester United in a re-match of the final played two years previously. Barcelona claimed their fourth European title as they ran out 3–1 winners.\nBackground.\nThis was the first time in the history of the Champions League (and European Cup) that the final was contested between two German sides. There were three previous Champions League finals between two clubs from the same country: 2000 (Spain), 2003 (Italy), and 2008 (England).\nIt was Bayern Munich's 10th European Cup/Champions League final, third all-time behind Real Madrid (12) and A.C. Milan (11). They won four of those finals: in 1974, 1975, 1976, and most recently in 2001. The 2013 final was Bayern's third final in four years; they lost in both 2010 and 2012 (as the first team since 1984 to reach the Final held in their home stadium), adding to previous final losses in 1982, 1987, and 1999.\nFor Dortmund, this was their second Champions League final, with them winning their first title in 1997. The next season as defending champions, they defeated Bayern in their only previous meetings in European competitions, winning 1–0 on aggregate in the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, before being eliminated 2–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals by Real Madrid, managed at the time by Jupp Heynckes.\nIn 2003, Bayern provided a €2 million loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Dortmund which has since been repaid. There has been a heated rivalry between Bayern and Dortmund, known in Germany as \"Der Klassiker\", which became prevalent during the 1990s. In 2011–12, Dortmund won the Bundesliga and the DFB Pokal with Bayern finishing runners-up in both competitions; Dortmund clinched the league title in a home match where bananas were tossed at Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. In 2012–13, Bayern bested Dortmund for both trophies, as well as the DFL-Supercup. Just before Dortmund's Champions League semi-final, it was announced that one of their homegrown stars, Mario Götze, would make a €37 million transfer to Bayern for the upcoming 2013–14 season, a move that some felt would have put more distance between wealthy Bayern and the rest of the Bundesliga. The final 2012–13 Bundesliga game between the two clubs was a 1–1 draw marked by acrimony as Bayern's Rafinha was sent off for elbowing Dortmund's Jakub Blaszczykowski, sparking an argument on the touchline between Dortmund coach Jürgen Klopp and Bayern sporting director Matthias Sammer. The press has used terms like 'power shift' and 'changing of the guard' after Dortmund and Bayern eliminated Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively, in the Champions League semi-finals.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nAmbassador.\nThe two-time Champions League winner and ex-England international Steve McManaman was appointed as the official ambassador for the final.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2013, Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli was selected to supervise the final. He was joined by compatriots Renato Faverani and Andrea Stefani as assistant referees, Gianluca Rocchi and Paolo Tagliavento as additional assistant referees, Gianluca Cariolato as reserve assistant referee, and Slovenian Damir Skomina as fourth official.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was directed by Kevin Spacey's executive assistant and The Prince's Trust ambassador Hamish Jenkinson and his business partner Jonny Grant, who had previously directed the 2011 opening ceremony, also at Wembley. The ceremony, also titled \"Battle of Kings\", was produced by Films United. It was directed and produced by Grigorij Richters and his producing partner Alex Souabni. Both were the former filmmakers-in-residence of Kevin Spacey and Jenkinson at The Old Vic Theatre in London. The film focused around the story of activist and fundraiser Stephen Sutton, who was part of the group of performers.\nMatch ball.\nThe match ball for the final was the Adidas Finale Wembley, which featured the same \"Starball\" panel configuration as the last three finals. The ball was predominantly white, with each star in blue with yellow patterning and a purple border. Six of the 12 stars featured designs recalling the six previous times that the European Cup final had been held at Wembley Stadium. The ball was unveiled on 30 January 2013 and was used for all knockout stage matches in the 2012–13 competition.\nTicketing.\nThe international ticket sales phase for the general public ran from 11 February to 15 March 2013. Tickets were available in four price categories: £330, £230, £140, and £60. Due to the high demand for tickets, allocation was determined by a lottery.\nThe two finalist clubs were allocated 25,000 tickets each. Borussia Dortmund received 502,567 requests for tickets, while there were approximately 250,000 orders for tickets from members of Bayern Munich. Both clubs used draws as a means of awarding tickets.\nRelated events.\nAs is the annual custom, the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Women's Champions League trophies were presented to the host city at a special ceremony at Banqueting House, Whitehall, on 19 April 2013. Receiving the trophies from UEFA President Michel Platini were the Minister for Sport and the Olympics Hugh Robertson and the Mayor of London's commissioner for sport, Kate Hoey. Representing the previous season's competition winners were John Terry, Frank Lampard, Petr Čech, Fernando Torres and Branislav Ivanović of Chelsea, and Lotta Schelin of the Lyon ladies' team. Also in attendance were final ambassadors Graeme Le Saux and Faye White, who had escorted the trophies from Stamford Bridge to Banqueting House via London's public transport system, and David Bernstein, the chairman of The Football Association.\nThe UEFA Champions Festival was held at the International Quarter, Stratford City, next to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, from 23 to 26 May 2013.\nThe 2013 UEFA Women's Champions League final was held at Stamford Bridge on 23 May 2013 between Wolfsburg and Lyon. Wolfsburg won the game, with Martina Müller scoring the only goal. This ensured that for the first time ever the same nation won both the men's and women's European club titles in the same year.\nMatch.\nTeam news.\nBorussia Dortmund's Mario Götze, who would join Bayern Munich in the summer, missed the match with a hamstring injury that had kept him out since the semi-final second leg against Real Madrid. Right-back Łukasz Piszczek did play, however, despite being due for hip surgery, while centre-back Mats Hummels recovered from a sprained ankle in time to play. Bayern Munich were without defender Holger Badstuber, who was expected to be out for 10 months with a knee injury, and Toni Kroos, who had yet to recover from an injury sustained in the quarter-final.\nSummary.\nDortmund were the dominant team in the first half-hour of the match, pressing Bayern intensely. Manuel Neuer made five important saves in the first 35 minutes, including two from shots by Robert Lewandowski and one from Marco Reus. Despite this dominance, Dortmund failed to generate many dangerous attacks, as Neuer's only difficult save came when Jakub Błaszczykowski volleyed a cross toward Neuer's near post, which the Bayern keeper deflected out for a corner. A Mario Mandžukić header forced a save from Roman Weidenfeller and Javi Martínez put a header from the ensuing corner just over the bar. The first half was an open affair; while Dortmund dominated the early stages, Bayern were still able to generate several chances through Arjen Robben, who forced Weidenfeller into three saves in the first half. Dortmund were able to generate many of their chances due to uncharacteristically poor play from Philipp Lahm, who gave the ball back to Dortmund in his own half on two occasions.\nBayern later took the initiative and scored the first goal in the 60th minute, when Robben and Franck Ribéry combined to set up Mandžukić for a left-footed finish, the ball going past Marcel Schmelzer on the goal line from three yards out. Shortly after, Dante raised his foot in the penalty area and caught Reus in the stomach; İlkay Gündoğan scored the resulting penalty, shooting low into the left corner and sending Neuer the wrong way. Bayern had a chance to re-take the lead several moments later, when Thomas Müller rounded Weidenfeller and attempted to find Robben, with the ball rolling towards the open goal, only for Neven Subotić to make a last ditch clearance off the line, preventing a tap-in from Robben. Late in the match, Bayern seemed the more likely to score, as David Alaba forced Weidenfeller into a save with a shot from long range. Moments later, a through-ball from Robben caught the Dortmund defence cold, resulting in Bayern having Müller and Mandžukić in a two-on-one with Weidenfeller. Subotić again came to Dortmund's rescue, as he was able to catch up and pressure Müller into playing a poor pass, which left Mandžukić with a tight angle, and the Croatian blasted into the side netting. With a minute left in normal time, Ribéry played in Robben with a back-heeled pass; the Dutch forward burst past the defence and scuffed a weak, low shot past the onrushing Weidenfeller with his left foot from eight yards out for the winning goal.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match reactions.\nBorussia Dortmund's manager Jürgen Klopp commented that the long season caught up with Dortmund. \"It was late in the game and from the 75th minute it was very hard for us after a tough season, but we deserved to be in the final and we showed that tonight\" he said.\nBorussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels said the game was really close and very disappointing, and that they were the better team in the first 25 minutes but missed the goal that was needed.\nBayern Munich's manager Jupp Heynckes said that \"We have achieved something unique\"."

        "text": "Debreceni Vasutas Sport Club, commonly abbreviated DVSC, is a Hungarian professional women's handball club from Debrecen, that plays in the Nemzeti Bajnokság I.\nSince August 2018 they are sponsored by Schaeffler Group, so the official name for the team is DVSC Schaeffler.\nHistory.\nNicknamed \"Loki\", the team was founded in 1948 as a department of the multi-sports club Debreceni VSC. Seven years later, they have won their first ever Hungarian championship title after beating two of their three opponents in the championship final, including title holders Csepeli SK. However, this achievement remained the lone success of the club for a long time, after they got relegated in 1959 and spent the subsequent twenty years in the second division.\nPromoted back in 1979, their brightest period came under the management of Ákos Komáromi, between the late eighties and mid-nineties, during which time they won the Hungarian championship, five Hungarian cups, and two consecutive EHF Cups. The latter one is an exceptional success; no other teams have ever defended their title in the EHF Cup.\nIn the following years, the club lost many of their key players and their financial options narrowed as well, which resulted a significant setback. The team was on the brink of bankruptcy, when András Gellén, a businessman and die-hard DVSC fan took over the club in May 2009.\nGellén had his own conception, that built solely on Hungarian players and promoted the youngsters. To fulfil the club's long-term plans, he also invested into a new arena for the handball academy, which was finished in January 2011 and cost around €1.4 million.\nIn the second part of 2011, however, DVSC faced a heavy financial crisis as Gellén could not pay the wages, and as a result, many of the first team players left. Gellén eventually sold his 63.3% share to the city of Debrecen for a nominal fee of 10 Hungarian Forint, that now owns 96.4% of the club. The city worked out a long-term project, which similarly to the club's former intention wants to build on home-grown players. The budget in the first season is expected to be around 100 million Forint (approximately €330,000), which may grow to 150–180 million (€500,000–600,000) in the coming years to ensure Debrecen to achieve a podium finish and to qualify to a European cup again. Balázs Makray took the chairman duties, who faced the similar situation in 1999 when he took over the local football club, and for the 2000s he made Debreceni VSC one of the dominant team in the Hungarian league.\nCrest, colours, supporters.\nKit manufacturers and Shirt sponsor.\nThe following table shows in detail Debreceni VSC kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors by year:\nHonours.\nDomestic competitions.\nNemzeti Bajnokság I (\"National Championship of Hungary\")\nMagyar Kupa (\"National Cup of Hungary\")\nEuropean competitions.\nEHF Cup Winners' Cup\nEHF Cup"

The 1957 and 1958 Forest Hills tournaments were both a round robin format, while the 1959 Forest Hills tournament was an elimination format with 10 players. The 1958 Kooyong Tournament of Champions was a round robin format, while the 1957 and 1959 White City, Sydney tournaments were an elimination format.\nThe 1958 Kooyoong Tournament of Champions, with 10,000 AUS£ prize money, was the richest tournament of the series.\nThe 1957 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions was broadcast live nationally in the U.S. on the CBS television network with complete broadcast coverage, the only professional tournament in the U.S. known to achieve this status prior to the Open Era. (The 1965 CBS Dallas pro tennis tournament was filmed and broadcast one match at a time as a weekly series.) The Forest Hills Tournament of Champions in 1957, 1958, and 1959 all featured a Pancho Gonzales vs. Lew Hoad singles match on the final day. The 1959 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions offered the largest winners' cheques of the year. The current designation by the West Side Tennis Club of the 1957-59 Forest Hills TOC is \"WCT Tournament of Champions\". Kramer's contemporary brochures described the Ampol series, of which the 1959 Forest Hills TOC was a part, with the term \"World Championship Tennis\".\nSponsors.\nThe Australian Tournament of Champions (TOC) was sponsored by Ampol Petroleum as the \"Ampol Tournament of Champions\". The prize money for the 1957 Sydney TOC was 7,500 AUS£, for the 1958 Kooyong TOC it was 10,000 AUS£, and for the 1959 Sydney TOC it was 5,000 AUS£.\nReferences.\nSources"

        "text": "Matthew Doyle (born 13 January 1955) is a former American and later Irish professional tour tennis player. His best result was reaching the fourth round of the US Open in 1982. He was also a long-time Irish Davis Cup player.\nTour overview.\nDoyle defeated Ricardo Acuña, Mark Edmondson and Hans Simonsson, all in four sets, to reach the Round of 16 at the 1982 US Open, where he went down to another American of Irish descent, John McEnroe, in straight sets. He won one singles tour title, the 1983 Cologne Grand Prix, and reached a career high singles ranking of world No. 65, in March, 1982. Doyle also reached the 3rd round of the 1984 Australian Open, and the second round of Wimbledon in both 1983 and 1984. In addition to reaching the Round of 16 in 1982, Doyle also reached the second round of the US Open in 1981 and 1984.\nIn doubles, he only got past the opening round in a Grand Slam main draw once, also at the 1982 US Open, partnering with his fellow Yale alumnus, (the late) Cary Leeds. His career doubles win–loss record for (top-tier) tour events was just 23 and 48, and his career high ranking was World No. 117. Despite this, he did manage a semi-finals showing at the 1982 Italian Open, where he partnered with Leo Palin, and one finals appearance in a tour event — a runner's-up showing in the 1982 Metz Grand Prix, partnering with David Siegler.\nDavis Cup.\nOf Irish ancestry, Doyle played in 17 Davis Cup ties for the Ireland Davis Cup team over 8 years. In the Irish's sole appearance in the World Group, in 1983, Doyle kept Irish hopes alive versus Italy in the first round by winning the fourth rubber over Claudio Panatta, in an away tie (played on clay). Unfortunately, however, Corrado Barazzutti was in top form and easily dispatched Sean Sorensen in the deciding fifth match, 6–0, 6–3, 6–3. (Doyle had also lost to Barazzutti in straight sets in the opening rubber.) This loss, however, set up a memorable tie versus the United States, with the winner to remain in the World Group for the following year. Played at RDS Arena to accommodate the 6000 spectators who attended, the match-up featured World No. 1 John McEnroe playing competitively for his only time in Ireland. As expected, McEnroe dominated, winning his two singles matches — as well as the doubles rubber with his partner Peter Fleming — in straight sets. Doyle stayed close in the first set versus McEnroe, succumbing in the end 7–9, before going down in the second and third sets 3–6, 3–6. Doyle did get the only consolation win, leveling the tie at one apiece by defeating Eliot Teltscher in the second rubber, 6–3, 6–4, 6–4. Doyle had a career singles Davis Cup match win–loss record of 19 and 10, and a doubles record of 8 and 7.\nPost-playing career.\nDoyle was work-out partner of Mats Wilander when the Swede reached his peak in 1988.\nPersonal.\nDespite playing for the Irish Davis Cup team as early as 1981, Doyle did not become a naturalized Irish citizen until 1985. He is judged officially to have represented the U.S. on the tour, aside from Davis Cup, until 1985.\nDoyle played at different times basketball, golf and tennis while attending Yale University, and graduated with a degree in economics.\nAccording to ATP.com, Doyle at some time resided in Dublin."

The competition was held from 27 July 1952 to 28 July 1952. 76 fencers from 29 nations competed. Nations were limited to three fencers each. The event was won by Edoardo Mangiarotti of Italy, the nation's fourth consecutive victory in the men's épée (passing France for most all-time). It was also the fourth consecutive year that Italy had at least two fencers on the podium in the event, as Edoardo's brother Dario Mangiarotti took silver. Bronze went to Oswald Zappelli of Switzerland. Zappelli and Edoardo Mangiarotti had faced each other in a barrage for silver and bronze medals in 1948, which Zappelli had won; the two men were the fifth and sixth to earn multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFour of the 10 finalists from the 1948 Games returned: silver medalist Oswald Zappelli of Switzerland, bronze medalist Edoardo Mangiarotti of Italy, eighth-place finisher Émile Gretsch of Luxembourg, and tenth-place finisher Ronald Parfitt of Great Britain. Also competing was Dario Mangiarotti, Edoardo's elder brother, part of the silver medal 1948 Italian team who had to withdraw from the individual event due to injury (his replacement, Luigi Cantone, won gold in the individual competition). The Mangiarotti brothers had each won a World Championship since the London Games, Dario in 1949 and Edoardo in 1951 (making him the reigning World Champion coming into the 1952 Olympics). The 1950 World Champion, Mogens Lüchow of Denmark, also competed.\nAustralia, Guatemala, Ireland, Japan, the Soviet Union, Venezuela, and Vietnam each made their debut in the event. Belgium and the United States each appeared for the 10th time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was pool play round-robin, with bouts to three touches. Not all bouts were played in some pools if not necessary to determine advancement. Ties were broken through fence-off bouts (\"barrages\") in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement. Ties not necessary for advancement were either not broken (if at least one fencer had not finished all bouts in the round-robin) or broken first by touches received and then by touches scored. In the final, ties were broken by barrage if necessary for medal placement but otherwise first by touches received and then by touches scored.\nFencers from the four nations that reached the team event final received byes to the quarterfinals.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to round 2.

The competition was held from 23 July 1952 to 24 July 1952. 61 fencers from 25 nations competed. All three medallists were left-handed. Nations were limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Christian d'Oriola of France, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's foil and sixth overall. D'Oriola was the fifth man to win multiple medals in the event. The silver and bronze medals were won by Edoardo Mangiarotti and Manlio Di Rosa of Italy.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Six of the eight finalists from 1948 returned: gold medalist Jehan Buhan and silver medalist Christian d'Oriola of France, bronze medalist Lajos Maszlay of Hungary, fourth-place finisher John Emrys Lloyd of Great Britain (in his fourth Games), sixth-place finisher Manlio Di Rosa of Italy, and seventh-place finisher Paul Valcke of Belgium. The Italian and French teams, as usual, were strong. For the French, d'Oriola was the 1947 and 1949 world champion and Buhan had been on the podium in 1950 and 1951. For the Italians, Edoardo Mangiarotti had finished third in 1949 and second in 1951 and Manlio Di Rosa had won in 1951.\nColombia, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Turkey each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its 10th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a four-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. The 1952 tournament introduced byes for the fencers from the top 4 nations in the team foil event, who advanced directly to the quarterfinals. Ties were broken through fence-off bouts (\"barrages\") in early rounds if necessary for determining advancement. Ties not necessary for advancement were either not broken (if at least one fencer had not finished all bouts in the round-robin) or broken first by touches received and then by touches scored. In the final, ties were broken by barrage if necessary for medal placement but otherwise first by touches received and then by touches scored. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top 4 finishers in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals.

The teams are members of the MCLA and the Division I and Division II conference tournament winners receive an automatic bid to the MCLA National Tournament.\nThe 2023 season saw the introduction of a Division III component to the conference, comprising community colleges and junior colleges."

        "title": "Penn State Nittany Lions women's ice hockey",
        "text": "Penn State Nittany Lions women's ice hockey is a college ice hockey program that has represented Penn State University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and College Hockey America (CHA) since the 2012–13 season. The program was preceded by a club team that competed at the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) Division 1 level, primarily as a member of Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League (ECWHL). Penn State plays its home games at Pegula Ice Arena in University Park, Pennsylvania.\nHistory.\nACHA years.\nPenn State's first women's hockey team – a club team called the \"Lady Icers\" – began play in the 1996–97 season, after students Ellen Bradley and Kathy Beckford recruited players from around campus and Vinnie Scalamogna, the assistant manager of the Penn State Ice Pavilion (then the university's sole ice facility), as coach. The Lady Icers' first game, a 5–4 win over the Susquehanna Rockettes (an adult club team), took place on February 1, 1997. The team was intermittently successful over its 16 years of existence, winning six conference regular season or playoff titles and qualifying for the ACHA National Tournament six times, peaking with a third-place finish at the end of the 2001-02 season.\nPenn State concluded its time in the ACHA in February 2012, with eventual NCAA leader Josh Brandwene as head coach. That season, the Lady Icers played a mixed schedule, featuring ACHA and ECWHL opponents as well as eleven games against NCAA Division I and Division III teams. PSU finished the year by claiming the ECWHL regular season title, but then losing to Rhode Island in the league's playoff championship game.\nMove to NCAA.\nAfter years of speculation the program transitioned to the NCAA Division I level along with the PSU men's ice hockey team for the 2012–13 season. The move was made possible thanks to a Penn State-record $88 million (later increased to $102 million) donation, announced on September 17, 2010, from Terrence Pegula, a Penn State alumnus and billionaire hockey fan, and his wife Kim. The donation primarily paid for the completion of a new 5,782-seat, $89 million ice arena to replace the undersized and aging 1,350-seat Penn State Ice Pavilion, which was deemed inadequate for long-term NCAA play. Pegula Ice Arena opened in September 2013, after the Nittany Lions played their first NCAA season in the Ice Pavilion.\nIn May 2011 the university hired Brandwene as the first varsity women's hockey head coach. On June 21, 2011, former Lady Icers head coach Mo Stroemel and Gina Kearns joined Brandwene's staff as assistants. Kearns had been an assistant with the Neumann University Knights, coaching there from 2009 until 2011. In September 2011, Penn State was accepted into College Hockey America for the 2012–13 season, becoming the fifth member of the conference after Wayne State abruptly ended their women's hockey program, dropping league membership to only four teams for the 2011–12 season.\nNCAA.\nThe Nittany Lions launched their NCAA era with a 5–3 victory over Vermont at Gutterson Fieldhouse on October 6, 2012, helped by a pair of goals each from Micayla Catanzariti and Shannon Yoxheimer. Behind a roster led by forward and captain Taylor Gross, forward Jenna Welch and goaltender Nicole Paniccia (each a transfer from the University of Connecticut), and featuring eight Lady Icers holdovers (including Gross) along with 17 freshmen, PSU climbed to 5–8–1 overall on November 17, 2012 with its first-ever CHA win, 3–2 over fellow former ACHA program Lindenwood. The Nittany Lions skidded the rest of the way through, managing only two wins (both against NCAA Division III Chatham University) over the final 21 games of the season, including a sweep by RIT in the first round of the CHA playoffs.\nThe 2013–14 season again began with a win at Vermont and a split in the team's first Pegula Ice Arena games, on October 18 and 19, 2013 against Union. However, despite eight ties or overtime losses and thanks largely to scoring just 1.36 times per game, the Nittany Lions regressed to four wins overall and were once again swept by RIT in the first round of the CHA playoffs.\nIn the 2014-15 season, PSU posted its first winning record (17-16-4), highest CHA standings position (tied for third) and first CHA playoff series win (against Lindenwood) before falling to Syracuse in the CHA semifinals, thanks largely to the Minnetonka, MN-native duo of Laura Bowman and Amy Petersen, who combined for 27 goals. One season highlight was a December 2014 sweep of then-No. 6 Mercyhurst, the Nittany Lions' first and second wins against a ranked team and against the perennially-powerful Lakers. However, the team slid slightly backwards in 2015-16, matching the previous season's CHA standings placement and playoff results (a first-round sweep of RIT followed by a triple-overtime loss to Syracuse in the semifinals) but finishing only 12-19-6 overall.\n2014 offseason controversy.\nA few weeks after the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, a group of thirteen players spoke with Penn State Associate Athletic Director Charmelle Green to \"express their frustration with Brandwene and concerns about the future of the program.\" Seven of this group were subsequently cut from the team, including Jessica Desorcie, Darby Kern, Cara Mendelson, Brooke Meyer, Katie Murphy, Birdie Shaw and Madison Smiddy. Murphy was the most outspoken of the cuts, telling Penn State student newspaper \"The Daily Collegian\" that \"[Brandwene] talked to us like we were children. Three or four weeks he would go without even looking at me or without even talking to me. He’s a bully. That’s the best word I can think of for him,\" and that \"The girls don’t respect the coach because he hasn’t earned our respect at all. He’s been my coach for three years and I tried my hardest to respect him and I still don’t have the respect for him that I should have for a head coach because he’s not a good coach.\"\nOver the days following Murphy's comments, others formerly involved with the program, including strength and conditioning coach Rob McLean as well as outgoing transfer players Katie Zinn and Taylor McGee also spoke critically of Brandwene.\n2016 offseason controversy.\nThe program again found itself the subject of negative headlines in March 2016, as Murphy, Mendelson, Shaw and others told or retold their stories to \"The Daily Collegian\". One of the chief allegations concerned the handling of the 2014 complaint, with Murphy and Shaw claiming that Green promised confidentiality to the group filing the complaint before subsequently burying the issue and turning their names over to Brandwene, who cut them - actions that would appear to be in violation of Penn State athletics guidelines. Several stories of emotional abuse were included as well. One anonymous former player said that Brandwene told her to lose weight in order to play more, while Shaw recounted an incident in which Brandwene physically knocked her stick from her hands while saying \"don't worry, you won't be needing that today.\" Shaw also said that Brandwene ruined the sport for her, to the point where she wouldn't allow her kids to play.\nAs with the 2014 situation, others came forward in the following days, including 2011-12 ACHA team players Katie Vaughan, Ashton Schaffer and Abbey Dufoe. Vaughan said that \"it became clear to me that this man has a destructive personality and he meant the team no well-being\" while recalling a conversation involving Brandwene pressing her about personal issues. Both she and Schaffer detailed other instances of emotional manipulation that almost caused them to end decade-plus playing careers, while Dufoe flatly said that \"no one should be treated like that.\" One father of an anonymous current player said that his daughter would transfer if Brandwene is retained as coach, and that \"he has heard other parents say the same thing.\"\n2017 offseason coaching change.\nOn April 19, 2017, Josh Brandwene retired from coaching, and on June 1, 2017, Penn State announced the hiring of longtime Princeton women's hockey head coach Jeff Kampersal to lead the Penn State women's hockey team beginning with the 2017–18 season.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

        "text": "Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey, formerly known as the Penn State Icers (the name for the former ACHA team), is a college ice hockey program that represents the Pennsylvania State University. Prior to the 2012–13 season the program was designated a club sport and competed at the ACHA Division I level. PSU was previously a member of the Eastern States Collegiate Hockey League (ESCHL, although the team competed as an independent ACHA D-I member for the 2011–12 season before moving to the NCAA D-I level. They play at the Pegula Ice Arena in University Park, Pennsylvania.\nHistory.\nPenn State ice hockey was inaugurated in 1938, aside from two games in 1909–10. Penn State fielded a varsity hockey team for five seasons in the 1940s (1940–44, 1946–47) before the sport was dropped due to limited facilities.\nACHA years.\nThe current program traces its roots back to 1971 when the program was restarted at the non-NCAA level. Consensus in the ice hockey community considered Penn State to play on a level comparable to NCAA Division III teams, with whom Penn State routinely scheduled games prior to the move to Division I. The Icers also played Division I, in-state opponent Robert Morris.\nWhen the program was resumed in 1971, it began playing a mix of non-NCAA club teams, NAIA teams and DIII teams. In the 1975–76 season Penn State became the first college ice hockey team to play in Europe. The team moved to the on-campus Greenberg Ice Pavilion, now known as the Penn State Ice Pavilion, in 1980. The 1,350-seat facility was the home of PSU hockey until 2013.\nFrom 1971 to 2012, Penn State teams won 7 ACHA National Championships, were runners-up 9 times, appeared in 29 ACHA postseason tournaments (including 10 consecutive championship games), won 9 conference playoff titles and recorded 8 conference regular season championships.\nIn the program's final season as a member of the ACHA, the team was led by Guy Gadowsky, who stayed on to coach as the team began play in the NCAA. Gadowsky brought a number of transfers and recruits for the NCAA DI team to prepare for a transition from club to varsity status. The team finished the regular season with a record of 27–4 and received a bid to the 2012 ACHA DI National tournament as the number one seed and ranked first in the ACHA. In the tournament, the Icers defeated West Virginia 4–1, followed by Oklahoma 6–3. In the semifinal round, Penn State faced Oakland (MI), who were ranked as the thirteenth seed. The game was a rematch of 2007 ACHA championship when the Golden Grizzlies upset the Icers. In a repeat of 2007, Oakland ended Penn State's season and era in the ACHA by a score of 5–3. \nThe Icers finished the season with an overall record of 29–5, 29–4 in ACHA competition and a 6–3 loss to NCAA Division III Neumann at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia as part of the 2012 NHL Winter Classic events in front of a crowd of 6,800.\nMove to NCAA.\nOver the summer of 2010 it was reported that Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and Terrence Pegula, a PSU alumnus, billionaire hockey fan, and possible large donor visited Minnesota's hockey facilities and the new on-campus Notre Dame Ice Arena currently under construction at Notre Dame and other Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) schools. Pegula, who would eventually go on to purchase the Buffalo Sabres, donated US$88 million (later upgraded to US$102 million) to the Penn State hockey programs for the purpose of building an arena. In August 2010 Tom Anastos, CCHA commissioner said the CCHA was interested in adding Penn State as a 12th member after Nebraska-Omaha left the league to join the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Without a women's league the women's team would not join the CCHA, speculation had the women's team joining College Hockey America (CHA), currently a 5-team league with teams in Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York.\nOn September 17, 2010, after years of speculation, it was officially announced the program would move to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level along with the PSU women's ice hockey team starting in the 2012–13 season and the program would initially compete as an independent team until the new arena was completed in 2013. The university also announced the construction of a new 6,000-seat ice arena to replace the undersized and aging 1,350-seat Penn State Ice Pavilion.\nFollowing the announcement by Penn State, the Big Ten Conference announced that the conference planned to begin sponsoring men's ice hockey in the 2013–14 season combining Penn State with Michigan State University, University of Michigan, and Ohio State University from the CCHA as well as the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin from the WCHA to form the six-member Big Ten Hockey Conference.\nOn March 26, 2015, Casey Bailey became the first Penn State player to play in the National Hockey League, debuting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 4–1 loss to the Florida Panthers.\nIn 2017, Penn State defeated Wisconsin to capture their first Big Ten Tournament championship. Freshman goaltender Peyton Jones earned the tournament's 2017 Most Outstanding Player Award. Four Nittany Lions made the All-Tournament Team: Jones, forward Liam Folkes, and defensemen Vince Pedrie and Erik Autio. In their first NCAA tournament game, Penn State notched 10 goals en route to a 10–3 victory. This marked the first time in team history that Penn State scored more than 8 goals in a varsity game. It also marked the most goals scored by a team in an NCAA tournament game since 1990.\nProgram record.\nPrior to NCAA D1 status\nThe Roar Zone.\nThe Roar Zone is the official student section for Penn State Men's Ice Hockey. Founded in 2013, the Roar Zone was created when Penn State Hockey became a Division I team and moved play from the Greenburg Ice Pavilion to the newly built Pegula Ice Arena. The Roar Zone became an official Penn State University club in early 2015 and is frequently featured on ESPN and Big Ten Network game coverages.\nThe Roar Zone holds more than 1,000 students on bleachers built to be the steepest allowed by code. All Penn State Hockey student season ticket holders are members of this organization.\nThe Roar Zone frequently works with Penn State Athletics to plan away game bus trips to watch conference and non-conference games. Notable trips include a bus trip to watch Penn State play in Madison Square Garden for the first time on January 30, 2016 and Penn State win an overtime win at the Munn Ice Arena on February 13, 2015.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nCumulative record against opponents.\nPrior to NCAA D1 Status\nCoaches.\nOn April 25, 2011, Penn State named Guy Gadowsky as the program's first NCAA Division I men's hockey coach. Gadowsky was previously the head coach of the Princeton Tigers from 2004 to 2011 and also served as head coach of the Alaska Nanooks from 1999 to 2004. He replaces Scott Balboni, who coached the Icers for five seasons from 2006 to 2011 and compiled a 150–35–8 record.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nDerek Hines Unsung Hero Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nBig Ten.\nIndividual awards.\nDefensive Player of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-Big Ten\nSecond Team All-Big Ten\nBig Ten All-Rookie Team"

        "text": "The Vuelta a España is an annual road bicycle race. Established in 1935 by the Spanish newspaper \"Informaciones\", the Vuelta is one of cycling's three \"Grand Tours\", along with the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia. Initially, the race was held in April/May, but in 1995 it was moved to September. The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi), although this has varied, passing through Spain and countries with a close proximity in Europe. The race is broken into day-long segments called stages. Individual finishing times for each stage are totalled to determine the overall winner at the end of the race. The course changes every year, but has traditionally finished in Madrid.\nIndividual times to finish each stage are totalled to determine the winner of the general classification at the end of the race. The rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears the leader's jersey. Since 2010 this has been a red jersey; previously it was gold. Other classifications have been calculated: those still in use are the points classification, in 2010 represented by a green jersey; the mountains classification, in 2010 represented by a blue dotted jersey; and the young rider classification, in 2019 represented by a white jersey.\nRoberto Heras holds the record of most victories with four, although his win in 2005 was subject to a successful appeal in court which overturned his initial disqualification for EPO in the 2005 race. Alberto Contador, Tony Rominger and Primož Roglič have both won three times. Angelino Soler is the youngest winner of the Vuelta at 21 years and 168 days old when he won in 1961. Chris Horner is the oldest winner of the Vuelta, winning the 2013 edition at the age of 41 years and 328 days old. Spanish cyclists have won the most Vueltas; 23 cyclists have won 32 Vueltas between them. French cyclists are second with nine victories and Belgian riders are third with eight wins. The current champion is Sepp Kuss of , who won the 2023 Vuelta a España.\nHistory.\nThe Vuelta a España was established in 1935 by the newspaper \"Informaciones\" following on from the success of the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia which had also been established by newspapers. The first race was won by Gustaaf Deloor, who won again the following year. The Vuelta was suspended for four years from 1937 to 1940 due to the Spanish Civil War. The first race after the civil war in 1941 was won by Julián Berrendero, who also won the following year. The Vuelta was suspended between 1943 and 1944 due to the Second World War. Delio Rodríguez won the first Vuelta after the war, Spanish riders won two more Vueltas in 1946 and 1948. The Vuelta was not held in 1949. Emilio Rodríguez was the victor in 1950, before the Vuelta was suspended from 1951 to 1954 as Spain's isolation during this period led to dwindling international interest in the race.\nJean Dotto won the first Vuelta after the four-year suspension in 1955. Angelo Conterno was the victor the following year, by a margin of 13 seconds over Jesús Loroño. Loroño was victorious in 1957 with Conterno absent. Rudi Altig became the first German to win the Vuelta in 1962. Frenchman Jacques Anquetil won in 1963, in doing so he became the first cyclist to win all three Grand Tours. Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx matched Anquetil's achievement in winning all three Grand Tours when he won the Vuelta in 1973. The following year José Manuel Fuente won the Vuelta by 11 seconds.\nBernard Hinault won the Vuelta in 1978, a year in which he also won the Tour de France. He won his second Vuelta in 1983. The following year Éric Caritoux won the Vuelta by the smallest margin ever, he won by six seconds over Alberto Fernández. Pedro Delgado won the Vuelta in 1985. Colombian Luis Herrera became the first non-European winner of the Vuelta in 1987. Sean Kelly was victorious in 1988, and the following year Delgado won his second Vuelta.\nSwiss riders dominated the 1990s; Tony Rominger won a record three Vueltas in succession from 1992 to 1994. Laurent Jalabert was victorious in 1995, he also won the points and mountain classification becoming only the third person to win all these classifications in a single Grand Tour. Alex Zülle won two Vueltas in succession in 1996 and 1997. German Jan Ullrich was the victor in 1999. Roberto Heras won his first Vuelta in 2000; he won a further two in 2003 and 2004. In 2005 he appeared to have won a record fourth Vuelta, however he was later stripped of his title after failing a drug-control test. Second place Denis Menchov became the victor.\nAlexander Vinokourov won the 2006 Vuelta a España with the team. Menchov won his second tour in 2007. Alberto Contador won the 2008 Vuelta; the victory meant he became the fifth cyclist to win all three Grand Tours. Alejandro Valverde was the victor in 2009. The following year Valverde was unable to defend his title after being suspended for two years for his involvement in the Operación Puerto doping case. Vincenzo Nibali won the 2010 Vuelta. Juan José Cobo won the 2011 Vuelta a España by thirteen seconds. However, on 12 June 2019, the UCI announced that Cobo was found guilty of an anti-doping rule violation in relation to his biological passport and stripped of his title six days later. Runner-up Chris Froome was awarded the win to retrospectively become the first British cyclist to win a Grand Tour.\nContador won his second Vuelta in 2012. American Chris Horner, became the oldest Grand Tour winner at the age of 41, when he won the Vuelta in 2013. Contador won the race for the third time in 2014, as he beat Chris Froome by one minute and ten seconds. Fabio Aru beat Tom Dumoulin by 57 seconds in 2015 to win the Vuelta. Nairo Quintana won the 2016 Vuelta, one minute and twenty-three seconds ahead of Froome. Froome was successful the following year to become the first rider since Hinault in 1978 to win the Tour and Vuelta in the same year. Simon Yates won the 2018 Vuelta. It was the third victory by a British rider in a Grand Tour in 2018 and the first time three different riders from the same country had won all three races in one year. Primož Roglič won the 2019 Vuelta to become the first Slovenian rider to win a Grand Tour. Roglič won again the following year, beating runner-up Richard Carapaz by 24 seconds. Roglič became the first rider since Heras to win three consecutive Vueltas, when he won the 2021 edition. Remco Evenepoel won the 2022 Vuelta a España. Sepp Kuss won the 2023 Vuelta by 17 seconds from his teammate Jonas Vingegaard.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "Garrison 1 Cricket Ground is a cricket ground in Chatham, Kent. The ground is owned by the Ministry of Defence and has been used by military teams throughout its history, being linked with the various military establishments at Chatham. It has been known as the Nore Command Cricket Ground and the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Recreation Ground, the Nore Command being associated with the nearby Chatham Dockyard. It remains the main home ground used by the Royal Engineers Cricket Club.\nThe ground is located immediately west of the outer defences of Fort Amherst, part of the 18th century military defences associated with the naval base, at the south-west corner of the Chatham Lines, an area of open space historically containing a number of military fortifications. It is overlooked by the Chatham Naval Memorial and is around north-east of Chatham town centre and west of Gillingham town centre. Although technically the ground is in Gillingham it, along with the military establishments nearby, is traditionally referred to as being located in Chatham.\nCricket history.\nThe first recorded match on the ground was in 1879, although cricket has been played on or near the ground since the middle of the 19th century and on the Great Lines since at least 1750.\nKent County Cricket Club used the ground for two Second XI fixtures, both against Norfolk County Cricket Club in the Minor Counties Championships of 1925 and 1926 and for three First XI first-class cricket matches, once in 1926 and twice in 1927. Derbyshire were the opposition in the grounds first first-class match in June 1926 and played Kent again on the ground the following year.\nThe Royal Navy played two first-class matches on the ground in 1929, against MCC and the Royal Air Force. The Navy used the ground regularly until 1960 and played their last match on the ground in 1980, Chatham Naval Base closing in 1984.\nThe ground was used by a variety of other teams, including the Army cricket team, who played a number of times against Kent's Second XI on the ground, and amateur clubs such as Band of Brothers and Incogniti.\nRoyal Engineers Cricket Club.\nThe Royal Engineers (RE) first played cricket in 1862 as a formal club. The nearby Garrison Ground 2 was used as the club's home ground initially, with Garrison Ground 1 first used in 1899 when it hosted one of the annual matches between the RE and the Royal Artillery. Garrison 1 Ground has been used regularly by the RE since the 1960s as their home ground, remaining in use as of 2017.\nRecords on the ground.\nA total of five first-class cricket matches were played on the ground, three with Kent as the home side and two with the Royal Navy playing at home.\nBoth the highest and lowest team totals scored on the ground were achieved by the same side in the same match. The Royal Navy scored 113 all out in their first innings batting against MCC in 1929. Following on they scored 382 in their second innings, winning the match after bowling out MCC for 139 runs in the final innings of the match.\nOther uses.\nThe Royal Engineers have also used the ground for hockey matches."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Philip Sheridan (Washington, D.C.)",
        "text": "General Philip Sheridan is a bronze sculpture that honors Civil War general Philip Sheridan. The monument was sculpted by Gutzon Borglum, best known for his design of Mount Rushmore. Dedicated in 1908, dignitaries in attendance at the unveiling ceremony included President Theodore Roosevelt, members of the President's cabinet, high-ranking military officers and veterans from the Civil War and Spanish–American War. The equestrian statue is located in the center of Sheridan Circle in the Sheridan-Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The bronze statue, surrounded by a plaza and park, is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The sculpture and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nPhilip Sheridan was a career United States Army officer who was instrumental in securing Union successes during the Valley Campaigns of 1864, most notably the Battle of Cedar Creek. Many of the Union generals would eventually be memorialized in Washington, D.C., with statues spread throughout the city. While looking at one of his comrade's equestrian sculptures, Sheridan was not impressed with the depiction of the man and horse. He reportedly told his wife \"Whatever you do after I'm gone, don't put me on a horse like that.\" Following her husband's death in 1888, when an equestrian sculpture of her husband was being planned, Irene Sheridan insisted the horse be as \"proud and courageous as its rider.\"\nOn March 2, 1889, Congress authorized the erection of a memorial to Sheridan and appropriated $50,000 for its construction. The original sculptor chosen to complete the project was Sheridan's friend John Quincy Adams Ward, who had completed other works in Washington, D.C., including \"Major General George Henry Thomas\" and the James A. Garfield Monument. Ward signed a contract with the Sheridan monument commission in 1892 which called for the equestrian statue to be completed by 1898. He submitted a sketch of the model in 1892, but that design was not approved. Not only did Ward not complete the work by 1898, he had only completed a life-size study of Sheridan's head by 1903. Ward finally completed a model of Sheridan, but when Irene and her son, Philip Sheridan Jr., visited Ward's studio in New York City to see the model, they both hated it. He was depicted as a stout older officer atop a stilted horse. The commission eventually cancelled the contract with Ward in 1905. His model of Sheridan was eventually cast in 1916 and stands in front of the New York State Capitol.\nGutzon Borglum had closely followed the events surrounding Ward's procrastination and firing as the two men had an argumentative past. Borglum was convinced he could do a better job with the design and he also needed the money. He set out to study as much as possible about Sheridan's life by reading his memoirs and biographies. Borglum was able to secure an invitation to a Washington, D.C. party that Irene attended. He sat next to her and invited Irene to his studio in New York. Borglum set out models of horses throughout the studio before she arrived and surprised Irene by how much he know about her husband. At the behest of Irene, on July 2, 1907, Borglum received a contract to sculpt the memorial. He was a Danish American artist who was greatly influenced by French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Borglum is best known for his carvings at Mount Rushmore and Stone Mountain. The Sheridan sculpture is his only equestrian monument in Washington, D.C. Borglum's other works in Washington, D.C. include \"Rabboni\" at Rock Creek Cemetery and several statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol.\nOn January 17, 1908, Borglum's design received approval by the Sheridan monument commission, including then-Secretary of War William Howard Taft, General Henry C. Corbin, and Brigadier General Michael V. Sheridan, Philip Sheridan's brother. Irene also approved the design and chose the memorial site.\nShe lived at 2211 Massachusetts Avenue NW (currently offices for the Embassy of Greece), a short distance from Sheridan Circle and the sculpture. As Borglum worked on the sculpture, he would talk to Sheridan's friends, sketch Sheridan's artifacts, and visit Irene. Since Philip Jr. bore a very close resemblance to his father, Borglum used him as a model for the sculpture. When the artwork was completed, Irene, Philip Jr., and Sheridan's three daughters loved the finished result. The sculpture depicts Sheridan riding his horse, Rienzi, as he assembles his troops during the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19, 1864. He had raced from Winchester, Virginia, to reach the battle. Following the Union victory, Sheridan renamed the horse Winchester. After Winchester died in 1878, Sheridan had him preserved and mounted. The horse is now on display at the National Museum of American History. Congress paid for the plaza, base, and preparation of the memorial site, while veterans of the Army of the Cumberland paid for the statue. Architect Henry Winslow designed the base and setting. The stonework was provided by the Mohegan Granite Company of New York while the Malnati Stone Company of Washington, D.C. set the stones in place.\nDedication.\nThe Sheridan memorial was dedicated on November 25, 1908. A large crowd was present with many dignitaries in attendance, including President Theodore Roosevelt, military officers, diplomats, and veterans of the Civil War and Spanish–American War. A processions of troops led by Brigadier General J. Franklin Bell paraded past the crowd and dignitaries while the United States Marine Band played music. Secretary of War Luke E. Wright presided over the dedication ceremony and Denis J. O'Connell, rector of The Catholic University of America, delivered the invocation. Roosevelt, Brigadier General Horace Porter, and Wright gave eulogies of Sheridan. Roosevelt gave a short speech praising Sheridan's valiant acts while Porter's speech was an in depth review of Sheridan's life, including his days at West Point and his campaigns during the Civil War and American Indian Wars. After Irene and Philip Jr. removed the covering of the statue, the crowd cheered loudly and many began to recite Thomas Buchanan Read's poem, \"Sheridan's Ride\".\nHistoric designation.\nAlong with seventeen other Civil War monuments, \"General Philip Sheridan\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. The Sheridan monument is also designated a contributing property to the Massachusetts Avenue Historic District, listed on the NRHP in 1974, and the Sheridan-Kalorama Historic District, listed on the NRHP in 1989. The sculpture and the surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.\nDesign and location.\nThe bronze equestrian sculpture is at the center of Sheridan Circle, a traffic circle located at the intersection of 23rd Street, R Street and Massachusetts Avenue NW within the Embassy Row section of the Sheridan-Kalorama neighborhood. It measures high and long while the rectangular granite base measures high. The horse is slightly reared back while standing on a rocky surface. Sheridan is turned to his right with his right arm extended behind him. The right hand is holding his hat while his left hand holds the horse's reins. Sheridan is wearing a military uniform with a long coat belted at the waist and is portrayed with a moustache and wavy hair. The sculpture is surrounded by a plaza measuring long with five steps on the front and back leading to the sculpture. Curved benches run along the interior of the plaza facing the sculpture while the exterior of the plaza features two pairs of lion head fountain spouts. Water poured from the spouts into square basins, but this feature is no longer working.\nInscriptions on the monument include the following:"

        "text": "The Equestrian Portrait of Margarita of Austria is a 1634 portrait of Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain on horseback by Velázquez, originally shown at the Hall of Realms of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid and now in the Prado Museum.\nHistory of the work.\nVelázquez had been commissioned to paint a series of five equestrian portraits of the royal family, Felipe III, his wife Queen Margaret of Austria, Felipe IV, his wife Elizabeth of France and their son Baltazar Carlos. This last was smaller than those of the other family members, as it was intended to be hung on a door and therefore viewed from a lower perspective.\nAs with the portrait of her husband, this portrait of Margarita evidences input from Velázquez' workshop. Velázquez retouched the work which his workshop produced, retouching the horse's harness in particular; this was originally very detailed. The same stroke fluidity can be observed in the redone head of the queen, but this process was reversed in the horse's mane and some portions of the landscape in the background, albeit hidden in the underlying technique of the painting. This may be Velázquez' work.\nDescription of the work.\nThe figure of the queen appears in an ornate dress, adorned with two pieces of jewelry known to belong to the Austrians, the pearl known as \"La Peregrina\" and the square-cut diamond called \"El Estanque\". The horse, posed in the 'passage' gait, is facing left, in order to mirror the horse posed in Margarita's husband's portrait, which faces to the right."

It has been in the Museo del Prado since the gallery's institution in 1819.\nHistory of the work.\nVelázquez had been commissioned to paint a series of five equestrian portraits of the royal family\nThis work of Velázquez had significant input from members of his workshop. The technical studies conducted in the Prado Museum under the direction of Carmen Garrido indicated that the five equestrian portraits were painted at the same time and with the same preparation. The idea that Velázquez retouched a painting by an earlier painter to add detail to the queen's clothing and the trappings of the horse has received support from a number of critics; X-rays reveal a painting under the visible one, in which the horse's girth is visible and the queen's clothing is simpler than the existing one. Later, when Velázquez was finishing details in the queen's head and the horse's legs, a more patient painter filled in the meticulous details of the embroidery, thus obscuring details of the painting previously laid down.\nDescription of the work.\nThe queen is depicted in profile, wearing a jacket with embroidered stars and a gold-embroidered skirt with her arms and initials. The horse is depicted as an overo with a long mane and forelock falling over its face, doing the passage gait; it is facing left in order to provide symmetry with the portrait of Elisabeth's husband, in which work he is facing right."

        "text": "Johnny Brown (born May 15, 1963) is a retired American basketball player and long-time college basketball assistant coach. He played power forward at the University of New Mexico from 1984 to 1986 and played professionally for five seasons. He has been an assistant coach for over twenty years at several schools, currently at University of the Incarnate Word.\nPlaying career.\nBrown went to Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, then spent his first two years of college at Loyola Marymount University. As a freshman in 1981–82 he averaged seven points and six rebounds, and as a sophomore he averaged 12.5 points and led the team with 8.7 rebounds a game. LMU did not offer the major that Brown wanted to pursue, so he decided to transfer. New Mexico coach Gary Colson saw him play in a summer league in Los Angeles and offered him a scholarship. Brown then sat out the 1983–84 season per NCAA transfer rules.\nBrown was a 6' 6\" forward, yet he was most comfortable playing inside the lane, using muscle and position to score and rebound over taller players. He thrived on contact and scoring in traffic, especially on bank shots off the glass, calling that \"maybe my best attribute.\" He learned to muscle inside by playing streetball with bigger players, including some who later played professionally.\nBrown missed the start of his junior season, 1984–85, with a foot injury, but he had an immediate impact when he joined the New Mexico line-up, scoring 26 to lead the team to a win at rival New Mexico State. The Lobos then beat NCAA tournament-bound Arizona before facing #1 Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing. The Lobos lost in a competitive game, with Brown and front-court mate George Scott keeping the game close despite a marked size disadvantage. Brown led Lobo scorers on the season with 18.8 points a game, adding 6.3 rebounds a game. Brown and Scott both placed among Lobo all-time leaders in field goal percentage in a season. The Lobos built a 14–6 record but then lost five of six down the stretch. They received a bid to the NIT, where they beat Texas A&amp;M and then lost to Fresno State, finishing the season 19–13.\nThe Lobos in 1985–86 suffered a key injury to guard Hunter Greene in the preseason, and Scott was lost to graduation. Senior Brown led an inexperienced squad with 20.9 points and 7.5 rebounds a game. He also led the team in field goal percentage and minutes played. The Lobos played well at home but struggled badly on the road. Despite a fifth-place finish in the WAC, the Lobos again received an invitation to the NIT, where they lost to Texas and finished 17–14. Brown was named first team All-WAC.\nIn his Lobo career, Brown scored 1,157 points, averaging 19.9 points a game. He is one of four Lobo players to score over a thousand points while playing only two seasons, and his career average is fifth best in school history. He also finished with the fifth best career field goal percentage in Lobo history (.569) and tied for first in single-game field goal percentage, going 11-for-11 in a game against Air Force. Brown graduated from UNM with a degree in University Studies, Sociology, and Speech Communication.\nBrown was selected in the seventh round of the 1986 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers, though he never played in the NBA. He played for five seasons in the World Basketball League (WBL), most notably with the Las Vegas Silver Streaks. He was named to the WBL All-Defensive Team in 1988, as Las Vegas won the league championship, and he was a three-time WBL All-Star.\nCoaching career.\nBrown has been coaching college basketball since 1992. He has worked at the Division I level on the staffs at Fresno State, Montana State, Northern Iowa, and Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi.

        "text": "The men's figure skating competition at the 1952 Winter Olympics took place on 19 and 21 February at Jordal Amfi and Bislett stadion. The compulsory figures were held at Jordal Amfi, while the Free skating was contested at Bislett stadion. The ice surface at Bislett was set inside the oval created by the speed skating track. It was also an outdoor arena, which was used for the opening and closing ceremonies. There were no issues with the weather and the skating surface at Bislett was immaculate. Computers were used for the first time during the figure skating competitions to help tabulate the judges' marks and relay the results instantaneously.\n17-year-old American Dick Button was the dominant force in men's international skating, having won the Olympic title in 1948, and the World Championships in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951. Only three men had come close to challenging him in the years since his first Olympic victory, teammates Hayes Jenkins and James Grogan, and Austrian Helmut Seibt, who had won the European Championships in 1951 and 1952. Button took a strong lead after the compulsory figures and just needed to skate safely in the free skating to earn his second gold medal. Instead he chose to perform the triple loop, which was the first triple jump ever performed in international competition. He executed the jump without error and finished his skate cleanly, he was awarded perfect marks by the judges and won his second Olympic gold medal.\nThe battle for second place was much closer and hotly contested between Hellmut Seibt and James Grogan. Seibt did well in the compulsories but faltered in the free skating. Grogan was third after the compulsories but could not overtake Seibt in the free skating. The final marks placed Seibt in second place by one-tenth of a point, the closest possible margin. Hayes Jenkins placed fourth and went on to win the gold medal at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. One week later Button, Grogan and Jenkins swept the World Championships. For Dick Button it was his fifth consecutive world title, and it also marked the end of his competitive skating career.\nResults.\nHere are the results of the men's figure skating competition.\nReferee:\nAssistant Referee:\nJudges:"

        "text": "College Baseball All-America teams are selected each year by various organizations and consist of players who compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) intercollegiate baseball. In general, an All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media or other organizations.\nCurrently, several organizations select their own individual, college baseball, All-America teams. The NCAA includes three selectors in its historical records: the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA), \"Collegiate Baseball\", and \"Baseball America\". According to its own website, the ABCA selected its first All-American baseball team in 1950. It has since chosen All-American teams and a player of the year for each division (NCAA Division I, Division II, Division III, NAIA, NJCAA Divisions I, II, and III, and high school). NCAA records, however, show ABCA teams since 1947. \"Collegiate Baseball\" selects college All-American, college Freshman All-American, and High School All-American teams, and a college player of the year. Its selections go back to 1991. \"Baseball America\" selects pre-season and post-season All-American teams and a College Player of the Year. Its selections go back to 1981. The National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) has selected All-American teams since 2001.\nConsensus \"All-Americans\".\nFor the names of consensus All-Americans, see footnote\nAfter the \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\" became – in 1991 – the third organization to begin selecting its own All-American teams (joining the ABCA and \"Baseball America\"), the concept arose of \"consensus\" All-American teams. From 1991 to 2000, a player is considered by some people to be a \"consensus All-American\" if he is named to an All-American team by two of the three organizations. In 2001, the NCBWA became the fourth organization to start naming its own teams. Therefore, since 2001, a player is considered by some people to be a consensus All-American if he is selected as an All-American by three of the four organizations."

        "text": "Ryan Miller (born July 6, 1989) is a former American football offensive guard. He attended the University of Colorado at Boulder. Miller was considered one of the best offensive guards of his class.\nHigh school career.\nMiller attended Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where he played offensive tackle and defensive end. He refused a starting position his sophomore year as playing varsity football was an overwhelming challenge. As a senior, he started all 14 games at offensive tackle, averaging well over 10 pancake blocks per game, did not allow a quarterback sacks, was flagged for just one penalty and had five direct touchdown blocks. On defense, he registered 31 tackles, 20 solo with 12 for losses including five sacks, with 10 hurries, four passes broken up, two fumble recoveries with one forced as a reserve. He was named Colorado's \"Gatorade\" Player of the Year, he earned a host of All-America honors for his senior season, including \"Parade\", \"USA Today\", SuperPrep, Rivals.com, PrepStar and MaxPreps. Miller was selected to play in the 2007 U. S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas, and he helped the West to a 24-7 win.\nRegarded as a five-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Miller was listed as the No. 2 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2007, behind only Josh Oglesby. He picked Colorado over scholarship offers from Miami (Fl.), Nebraska, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and USC.\nCollege career.\nIn his true freshman year at Colorado, Miller played in 10 games and started seven, including the 2007 Independence Bowl, at right offensive tackle. He became the first tackle to play as a true freshman at Colorado since Bryan Campbell, who played as a reserve behind Mark VanderPoel on the 1989 and 1990 teams, and when he started, that made him just the ninth true freshman to start a game on the offensive line at Colorado since freshmen were allowed to play again in 1972. Miller earned first-team Freshman All-America honors from \"The Sporting News\", second-team by Scout.com, and third-team by College Football News. TSN also selected him first-team Freshman All-Big 12.\nAfter starting the first four games of his sophomore season at right tackle, Miller went down with a broken fibula on the second play of the second half against Florida State in Jacksonville, Florida. He was granted a medical hardship after missing the bulk of the 2008 season due to injury, thus he picked up an extra year of eligibility. Miller returned to the field in 2009, and started all 12 games, seven at right guard where he opened the season, and five at right tackle when the line was shuffled for assorted reasons. His was a Walter Camp All American his senior year. He was also an Outland Trophy Candidate, given to the best lineman in college football.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Browns.\nMiller was drafted in the fifth round with the 160th overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2012 NFL Draft.\nOn July 27, 2013, Miller sustained a head injury during blocking drills at the Browns' indoor facility. He was taken by ambulance to the Cleveland Clinic where he was treated. He played in 8 games as a rookie.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn December 31, 2013, Miller was signed to a future contract with Denver Broncos. He officially joined the Broncos' roster on March 11, 2014. He was later released from the practice squad on October 7, 2014.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nOn November 12, 2014, he was signed by the San Diego Chargers to the practice squad, then to active roster. He suffered a torn groin and then a concussion after returning to the field. He was medically released on December 8, 2014.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn January 15, 2015, Miller was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to a future contract. On July 28, 2015, he was waived by the Cowboys. On the following day, he cleared waivers and was reverted to the Cowboys' injured reserve list. On September 15, 2015, he was released by the Cowboys with an injury settlement."

        "title": "Cycling in Portland, Oregon",
        "text": "Bicycle use in Portland, Oregon has been growing rapidly, having nearly tripled since 2001; for example, bicycle traffic on four of the Willamette River bridges has increased from 2,855 before 1992 to over 16,000 in 2008, partly due to improved facilities. The Portland Bureau of Transportation says 6% of commuters bike to work in Portland, the highest proportion of any major U.S. city and about 10 times the national average.\nDue to its urban bicycling efforts, Portland has earned multiple \"bicycle-friendly city\" awards, including being awarded platinum status by the League of American Bicyclists, and it ranked second in the CNBC's 2019 most bicycle-friendly cities in the US.\nIn July 2016, Portland launched a bike share program, named \"Biketown\" because of a naming rights deal with Nike, with 1,000 bikes and 100 stations. It is operated by Motivate. The new system logged more than 100,000 rides in its first two months of operation.\nHistory.\nPortland's reputation as a bike-friendly City was enhanced by The Yellow Bike Project, a 1994 civic engagement action led by local activists Tom O'Keefe, Joe Keating and Steve Gunther. O'Keefe proposed painting donated bikes – repaired by at-risk-youth served by the Community Cycling Center – bright yellow, and deploying them for free use around Portland. O'Keefe cited the Provo movement's White Bicycle Plan in Amsterdam as inspiration after watching the documentary \"Sex Drugs &amp; Democracy\". \"Gratis Pedalis Feralvus\" was a tongue-in-cheek slogan for the quirky eco-transportation project. About a dozen yellow bikes, painted for free by a local auto body shop were launched. Eventually 60 to 100 bicycles were part of the project. Ultimately the project failed after bikes were stolen, vandalized, or thrown into the Willamette River.\nBicycle Transportation Alliance.\nThe bicycle revolution in Portland started taking off with the founding of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance in November 1990. The first project of the BTA was persuading TriMet, the regional transit agency, to carry bicycles on its buses and light rail trains. BTA gathered over 7000 signatures and the support of numerous local city councils, prompting TriMet to conduct a one-year trial on a few bus lines. After a year of no significant problems and an increase in transit ridership by cyclists, TriMet instituted the first 100% bicycle accessible major transit system in the U.S. The Bicycle Transportation Alliance grew into one of the most effective cycling advocacy organizations in the U.S. The BTA focused on making major streets safe for cycling by advocating bicycle lanes, improvements to all seven pedestrian-accessible Willamette River bridges linking the downtown to the rest of the city and for safe, secure bicycle parking. In 1992, BTA successfully sued the City of Portland under ORS 366.514, the Oregon \"Bicycle Bill,\" forcing the city to provide bicycle facilities as part of all projects. The City appealed this to the Oregon Court of Appeals which upheld the BTA's position, solidifying the responsibility of all governments in Oregon to provide safe bicycle and pedestrian facilities in all projects.\nPortland Bike Plan.\nInterest in city transportation planning began in the early 1970s after the state of Oregon passed comprehensive state land use laws with the city of Portland drafting its first 'Bicycle Master Plan' in 1973.\n1973.\nThe city's first bike plan that was adopted in 1973, titled the '1973 Portland Bike Plan', called for nearly 190 miles of bicycle infrastructure to be built in the city and created a citizen's Bicycle Advisory Committee along with a Bicycle Program within the city's Transportation Bureau.\n1996.\nBy 1996, after the city had created the nearly 190 miles of initial bicycle infrastructure from the first plan, the city adopted its second bike plan in 1996, titled the 'Portland Bicycle Master Plan', which called for an additional 445 miles of bicycle infrastructure to be built over the next 20 years (cumulative of 630 miles by 2016).\n2010.\nThe city revised its bicycle plan again in February 2010 when the Portland City Council unanimously adopted its third bike plan, titled the 'Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030', which called for $613 million of spending on bicycle infrastructure over the next 20 years to expand the bicycle infrastructure target from 630 miles by 2016 to 962 miles by 2030 and increase the daily bicycle modal share from the current 7-8% to 25% by 2030. With only about 300 miles of bicycle infrastructure built by the end of 2009, the plan sets a target of building 662 miles of new bicycle infrastructure in the city over the next 20 years.\n2012.\nWith enabling legislation from the 2011 session, Portland lowered speed limits from on of designated neighborhood greenway streets to increase safety for increasingly heavy use by pedestrians and bicyclists.\nBicycle infrastructure.\nPortland is developing a network of bicycle boulevards to make cycling easier and safer. The east side of Portland is particularly well-suited for this technique due to its consistent grid of north–south and east–west streets. The boulevards are defined with a combination of street markings, signs, and better signals for crossing busy intersections.\nAnother route is the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade.\nIn order to try to prevent car-bike crashes the city has painted sections of hazardous bike lanes blue.\nMore recently, the city has installed experimental bike boxes that allow bicyclists to wait ahead of motorized traffic at red lights.\nAn important milestone in Portland's utility cycling infrastructure was the expansion of the sidewalks of Hawthorne Bridge in 1997, which significantly improved the safety and ease of bicycle commuting across the Willamette River.\nIn 2004, a bike path along the Sunset Highway between Sylvan and Cedar Hills was completed, helping to link Beaverton and downtown Portland.\nBicycle access to the Morrison Bridge opened to mixed reviews in March 2010.\nIn recent years, the City of Portland has built personal motor-vehicle free bridges for pedestrians and cyclists whose commute crosses busy interstates or the Willamette river, and need a safe route. Some of these bridges include the Blumenauer Bridge (2022), Ned Flanders Crossing (2021), and the Tilikum Crossing (2015), which is open to pedestrians and cyclists, as well as MAX, buses, and Streetcar.\nIn 2021, PBOT began to place large, concrete planters to replace the traffic cones they had used for the previous year, in order to slow down traffic on neighborhood streets. They were strategically placed at intersections in residential neighborhoods, and most have signage above them which indicate a recommended speed limit of 15 mph.\nBicycle parking.\nA recent project will bring covered bicycle parking to the popular southeast Hawthorne Boulevard shopping district.\nEvents.\nThe Bicycle Transportation Alliance sponsors an annual Bike Commute Challenge, in which thousands of commuters compete for prizes and recognition based on the length and frequency of their commutes.\nPedalpalooza is an annual festival with hundreds of community-organized free bike events.\nStatistics.\nThe following table shows Portland's historical bike commuting mode share with data coming from the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey:"

        "text": "The equestrian events at the 2012 Olympic Games in London were held between 28 July and 9 August at Greenwich Park. Medals were awarded in three disciplines for both individual and team competitions.\nGreat Britain was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with three golds and five medals in total. They were particularly dominant in team events, taking two gold medals and a silver medal from three team events.\nEvents.\nMedals were awarded in the following competitions:\nQualification.\nEach event has its own qualification rules, but generally rely on FEI rankings.\nDressage qualification.\nFor the team competition there was a total of 11 quota berths available. Three team berths were awarded at the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games. In addition 7 team berths were awarded at regional competitions (Europe: 3, America: 2, Asia: 2). In addition, should a country have qualified 3 athletes in the individual competition, they also qualify as a team and were allowed to compete in the team competition.\nFor the individual competition, 50 berths were allocated as follows: 33 to the athletes who qualified from the teams above. In addition, the highest ranked rider from each of seven geographic regions qualified. The top ten riders based on FEI ranking who did not qualify otherwise were given berths as well.\nJumping qualification.\nA country may send up to four riders if it qualified for the team competition. Similar to dressage, teams of four riders were qualified at either the World Equestrian Games (WEG) or through a regional competition. The WEG awarded five berths, the regions six (America: two, Europe: two, Asia: two), and the hosts (Great Britain). For the individual competition there was a total of 75 berths allocated as follows: 45 from the above teams the rest regional or through rankings.\nEventing qualification.\nA country may send up to five riders if it qualified for the team competition. Similar to dressage, teams of five riders were qualified at either the WEG, a regional competition, or through a composite spot. The WEG awarded five berths, the regions seven (America: three, Europe: three, Middle East &amp; Africa: one), the hosts (Great Britain). For the individual competition there was a total of 75 berths allocated as follows: 55 from the above teams, 7 through regional competitions and 13 through the world rankings.\nCompetition format.\nShow jumping.\nFive rounds are ridden to determine individual medals. Riders placing first through 60th (including ties for 60th place) advance to the second round. The top 45 riders of round 2, including ties for 45th, advance to the third round. The top 35 riders of the third round progress to the 4th round, but only up to three riders per team (so if a country has four riders in the top 35, one of those is not allowed to compete for individual medals).\nIn the fourth round (individual final round A), the slate is wiped clean and all riders begin with zero faults. The top 20 riders in round 4 advance to round 5 (individual final round B), and ride another course. The faults for individual final round A and B and added together to determine individual medals.\nThe team competition completes three rounds to determine medals. It runs concurrently with the individual competition (riders running over the same course) so team riders are also competing for individual medals. The first round for team competition is the round 2 course for individual medals. The top eight teams from the first team round advance to the second team round (which is the same course as the individual round 3). The scores for these eight countries over team rounds 1 and 2 are combined, and medals are awarded based on those scores.\nDressage.\nTeams are made up of three riders, all of whom are also competing concurrently for individual medals. Additionally, countries who can not make a full team may send riders to compete for individual medals.\nAll riders compete in the Grand Prix, which serves as the first round of both the individual and team medals. The top seven teams (included those tied for 7th) advance to the Grand Prix Special, which is a slightly more rigorous test. The combined scores for those teams in both the Grand Prix and the Special determine the team medals, with the team with the highest score winning gold.\nRiders completing the Grand Prix test (first qualifying round of the individual competition) may move on to the Grand Prix Special (second qualifying round for the individual competition) if their team is in the top seven (21 riders total). Additionally, the top 11 riders who do not qualify with a team may also advance to the Special to ride for individual medals. The top 18 riders from the Special move on to the third individual round, the freestyle. Each rider designs their own test for the freestyle, which must be set to music and has several compulsory movements. Riders can tailor a test to their horses' strengths, as well as incorporate movements that are more difficult than those required in the Grand Prix or the Special (such as a pirouette in piaffe) in order to increase their scores. Individual medals are assigned based on scores in the freestyle.\nEventing.\nCompetitions for team and individual medals ran concurrently. Riders performed a dressage test, a cross-country round, and a jumping round. Team medals were then awarded by adding together the best three scores from a country's team, out of a maximum of five team members, from all three phases, the team with the lowest number of penalty points winning the gold. The top 25 individual scores after the first show jumping round performed a second, final, show jumping round to determine individual medals, with up to 3 riders in the individual running per team. Therefore, those competing for individual berths completed one dressage test and cross-country round, and two jumping rounds.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of officials was as follows:\nMedal summary.\nGallery.\nGallery of some of the gold medalists in the equestrian events:"

Each nations top ranked player was then joined by the second highest player of that country. For seeding the average rank of both was used.\nThe top 8 nations automatically started in the second round (last 16). The other 16 nations played in the first round. Matches were best of 11 legs in doubles, and the losing team threw first in the next leg. The winners of the first round played the top eight ranked teams in the second round, also in best of 11 doubles.\nThe winners of the second round were placed into two groups of four (A &amp; B).

Each team played each other once (three matches per team). Each match consisted of two singles and one doubles - all over best of five legs. 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win, with all points counting towards the overall league table. The top two teams in each group advanced to the semi-finals.\nThe semi-finals consisted of four singles games and one doubles game (if required) per match - all over best of 11 legs. Again, 1 point was awarded for a singles win, and 2 points for a doubles win. If the match score was 3–3 at the end of the games, then a sudden-death doubles leg would decide who goes through to the final.\nThe final was the same format as the semi-final, but each game was best of 15 legs.\nResults.\nFirst and second rounds.\nThe matches were best of 11 legs in the doubles format.\nGermany had a bye to the second round, as the Czech Republic were unable to travel due to the inclement weather.\nGroup stage.\nSingles matches were worth one point, doubles matches were worth two points.

The tournaments are divided into two divisions: the Juniors tournament for male high school students, and the Seniors tournament for male college students.\nLosing only one game against the PCU Dolphins, the San Beda Red Lions only suffered one loss to finish first in the elimination round. San Beda's Nigerian center Samuel Ekwe won Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. PCU and the Letran Knights were tied for second place; the Dolphins won the second-place playoff to seize the #2 seed and the twice-to-beat advantage. San Beda dispatched fourth-seed Mapua Cardinals in the semifinals, and the Dolphins qualified to the Finals for the third consecutive time by beating the Knights in their own semifinal. The Red Lions and the Dolphins exchanged blowout wins in the first two games of the Finals; in the deciding third game, San Beda won their first NCAA men's basketball championship since 1978, Yousif Aljamal was named Finals MVP.\nIn the juniors division, the San Sebastian Staglets swept the San Beda Red Cubs, 2-0, to take their second title, as Ryan Buenafe won Finals MVP honors.\nMen's tournament.\nPreseason.\nFormer UP Fighting Maroons basketball player and Philippine Basketball Association commissioner Jun Bernardino assumes the role of basketball commissioner for the season.\nOn a report published on June 12, it was reported that JRU Heavy Bombers coach Cris Calilan, part of the 1972 champion team (JRU's last championship) resigned from the team and took most of the players with him.\nTo prevent allegations of game-fixing, the Management Committee asked for the help of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to thwart efforts of such activities.\nAll of the elimination round games after Opening Day will be held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex at Manila.\nNew coaches are Raymund Valenzona of the San Sebastian Stags, and Ariel Vanguardia of JRU. Valenzona is a son of retired coach Turo Valenzona, while Vanguardia who was tasked to replace former coach Cris Calilan, who left the team. San Beda Red Lions coach Koy Banal would be on his first full season as coach of the Red Lions.\nOn June 22, PCU Dolphins head coach Junel Baculi resigned due to health reasons. He will be replaced by Joel Dualan on an acting capacity. Management Committee (MANCOM) chairman Bernardo Atienza of CSB clarified on an interview broadcast during the opening ceremonies that a rumoured seven-game suspension for Baculi for using indecent language in a PCU game on a tune-up league was untrue.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nNBI agents were present in the Ninoy Aquino Stadium, monitoring the basketball games. Rumours still persist that there were still efforts of game fixing in the games. The suspects \"resurfaced\" during the first round game between the Blazers and the Heavy Bombers, the day where the agents were supposedly absent.\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nSecond–seed game.\nLetran and PCU ended tied for second place as both teams having an identical 10-4 records, as a result a playoff game for the #2 seed and the twice to beat advantage at the semifinals that goes along with it was held, leading to a \"de facto\" first game of a best-of-three series.\nAfter a tightly contested first quarter, the Dolphins went on a rampage, posting an eighteen-point lead at the start of the fourth quarter. With increased taunting from both sides, the Knights mounted a furious comeback, trimming the lead to one point thanks to Mark Balneg's 6–1 run. Gabby Espinas made a driving lay-up with 39 seconds left to increase PCU's lead to three points. Aaron Aban missed a three-point and had to foul Espinas, but he made both free-throws to clinch PCU the #2 seed.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nSan Beda and PCU have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) San Beda vs. (4) Mapua.\nSan Beda started tentatively with the match but managed to lead early at 10-4 with a Sam Ekwe put-back. After that, the Red Lions offense sputtered, which the Cardinals took advantage of racing to a 7-point lead at the end of the half. The Red Lions managed to crawl back to within two at the end of the third and it was one frustration after another before San Beda equalized late into the fourth period with free throws from rookie Pong Escobal. The Red Lions grabbed the lead for good after a three-pointer from Menor and survived some late game heroics from the Cardinals who came to within a point before good defense from San Beda and a costly Mapua passing error sealed the Cardinals' fate with 4 seconds remaining.\n(2) PCU vs. (3) Letran.\nPCU and Letran managed to trade baskets early in the game but the Dolphins played better basketball as they managed to score uncontested layups. The Knights managed to cut the lead into two points early in the third quarter but the Dolphins answered back and closed out the game, 72-50.\nFinals.\nThe Dolphins are in their third consecutive Finals appearance; they defeated the Perpetual Altas in 2004 under coach Loreto Tolentino, lost to the Letran Knights in 2005 with Junel Baculi at the helm, and are now facing the San Beda Red Lions.\nThe Red Lions, on the other hand, are in their first Finals appearance since 1997, where they were defeated by the Rommel Adducul-led San Sebastian Stags. They've last tasted the championship in 1978, with Chito Loyzaga as team captain.\nIt was a nip and tuck affair in the first half of Game 1 with the Dolphins managing a slight margin at the end of the second quarter. San Beda however bounced back and outscored the Dolphins 20-5 in the penultimate quarter to pull away and draw first blood.\nSan Beda started tentatively Game 2 with poor shooting. Reigning MVP and focal point of the Red Lion defense, Sam Ekwe was also hobbled with a knee injury. The Dolphins took advantage of this situation and efficiently worked their offense to run the Red Lions to the ground in the first half. It was virtually over by the start of the 2nd half as the Lions continue to fire blanks and the Dolphins proceeded to spoil San Beda's bid to end 28 years of frustration.\nSan Beda ended 28 years of frustration with a win over former champions PCU. Down by 15 points at the start of the fourth quarter, the Dolphins made a furious comeback, cutting the lead to one point with 24.8 seconds remaining due to the exploits of Jayson Castro. After another San Beda turnover, the Dolphins had an opportunity to win the championship with Castro dribbled out the time before passing to Beau Belga; Belga's shot bounced off the rim as Yousif Aljamal rebounded the ball, leading to San Beda's championship. It was the 12th men's championship for the Red Lions. Forward Yousif Aljamal was named Finals MVP, after showing the same offensive consistency that was sorely lacking during their game 2 blowout loss.\nAwards.\nNigerian exchange student Samuel Ekwe got four out of five awards given by the NCAA Press Corps:\nSuspensions.\nSeven players had been suspended by the Management Committee:\nJuniors' tournament.\nWith the aftermath of the PCU Baby Dolphins eligibility scandal, the NCAA forfeited all wins of PCU in Season 82. The results in this section show the results prior to its forfeiture.\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;\nAwards.\nJake Pascual won four individual awards in the Juniors' division.

        "title": "St. Cloud State Huskies men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The St. Cloud State Huskies men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents St. Cloud State University. The Huskies are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. They play at the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\nHistory.\nFormation and war years.\nSt. Cloud State Teachers College founded its varsity ice hockey program in 1931, joining several other Minnesota-based schools. After an expectedly poor first season, St. Cloud began dominating their competition under Ludwig Andolsek, the team's second head coach. During the third year, a freshman named Frank Brimsek served as the team's starter. Brimsek was so spectacular in goal that he left after just one season and began a professional career, a rarity for college players at the time. While Brimsek would go on to have a Hall of Fame career, the Huskies didn't appear to miss him and went 25–2 in 1935, posting the best record in the nation. However, because only one of their games was played against a fellow institution, the Huskies weren't considered for the intercollegiate championship.\nAndolsek left after his third season and the team struggled in his absence. In the seven years that followed, the team hovered around .500 and were relegated to secondary status. In 1942, due to the United States entry into World War II, St. Cloud suspended many of its athletic programs, which included the ice hockey team. The program was restarted after the war and saw some success, however, because the program was not a member of any conference, the Huskies were occasionally hamstrung by a lack of playing time.\nWink and Basch.\nIn 1956, After going through six different head coaches in ten years, the team hired Jack Wink. The new bench boss stabilized the program and led the Huskies to stellar records in the early-60's. The team finished the 1962 season undefeated but, as had happened a decade earlier, a reduced schedule following those highs caused the team to fall on hard times by the late-60's. After successive 1-win seasons, Wink was replaced by Charlie Basch who set about a steady rebuild for the program.\nBasch took almost twice as long as Wink had to turn the Huskies into consistent winners. Once he did, however, he was able to keep them at the top of their game for much longer. In 1978, the NCAA began sponsoring a Division II tournament. Because St. Cloud was one of the few western teams that did not participate in the NAIA Championship, they were invited to participate in a Western Championship Tournament, which would determine which two teams received bids. St. Cloud State played in the WCT for the first four years of its existence, unfortunately they were never able to win a single match and never received an invitation to the actual tournament.\nIn 1980, the Huskies finally ended their long run as an independent and helped found the NCHA. Poor results in conference play prevented the team from having a chance at an NCAA bid, a trend that continued as almost all Division II programs dropped down to Division III in 1984.\nSwift climb to D-I.\nJohn Perpich took over for Basch in 1984 and led the team through two mediocre seasons before the athletic department decided to raise the profile of the program. Perpich stepped aside and allowed legendary Minnesota coach Herb Brooks to take over in 1986. News of the move spurred several prospects to join the program, including NHL draft picks Tony Schmalzbauer and Shorty Forrest. The Huskies went on to win the program's first conference title (tied) and the first conference tournament ever played by the NCHA. Brooks' team was one of the favorites for the national championship despite being a debutant but they were stymied by Oswego State and ended up 3rd in 1987.\nBrooks left after the year to return to the NHL, but his time with the team had been a success. The very next year, St. Cloud promoted the program to Division I with Brooks' assistant, Craig Dahl taking over. The Huskies continued their rapid ascent with a winning record in 1989 and, due in part to the NCAA's policy of including a non-tradition team in the tournament at the time, St. Cloud made its first appearance in the D-I tournament in 1989.\nWCHA.\nAfter three years as an independent, St. Cloud joined the WCHA in 1990. Widely regarded as the best conference at the time, the WCHA made it difficult for St. Cloud to compete for a further NCAA bid. In spite of the tough opposition, the Huskies thrived in their new conference and routinely finished in the top half of the standings. There were several near-misses for championships and tournament bids but, at the end of the 20th century, the Huskies finally returned to the national tournament. In three consecutive years, St. Cloud made the NCAA tournament but lost each game they played. The program then declined for a few years and Dahl stepped down after the 2005 season.\nBob Motzko, an alumnus of the team, took over and swiftly turned the team's fortunes. In his first five seasons he got the Huskies to appear in two WCHA championship games. Though he lost both, he was able to get the Huskies their first win in NCAA tournament play. Three years later, Motzko led the team to its first WCHA regular season title and led the Huskies to the Frozen Four.\nNCHC.\nAfter the deep playoff run, St. Cloud State joined with seven other schools to form the NCHC in response to the Big Ten Conference joining the ice hockey ranks. The new league was built around traditional powerhouses and the Huskies looked right at home, winning the inaugural regular season title. Under Motzko, St. Cloud continued as one of the top teams in the conference, receiving 4 NCAA bids over a five-year span. In 2018, St. Cloud was the #1 team in the nation as it began the tournament but were upset in the first game by Air force.\nMotzko left after the year to take over at in-state rival Minnesota and he was replaced by Brett Larson. The Huskies only seemed to get better under their new coach and were again the top-seeded team in 2019. Despite dominating play for most of their opening match, the Huskies were again felled by the lowest-seeded team. After a down year that was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, St. Cloud returned with a strong 2021 and reached the championship game for the first time in its history.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical Leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nTim Taylor Award\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nOutstanding Student-Athlete of the Year\nDefensive Player of the Year\nFreshman of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in tournament\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond Team All-WCHA\nThird Team All-WCHA\nAll-WCHA Rookie Team\nNCHC.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nForward of the Year\nDefensive Forward of the Year\nDefenseman of the Year\nDefensive Defenseman of the Year\nOffensive Defenseman of the Year\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\nSportsmanship Award\nHerb Brooks Coach of the Year\nFrozen Faceoff MVP\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-NCHC\nSecond Team All-NCHC\nNCHC All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of St. Cloud State alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nHuskies in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "The Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey team is an NCAA Division I college ice hockey program that represents Minnesota State University, Mankato. The Mavericks compete in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). Their home arena is the Mayo Clinic Health System Event Center located in downtown Mankato, Minnesota.\nHistory.\nThe Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey team commenced play as a varsity sport in 1969-70. They competed independent of a conference affiliation at the NCAA Division II level from 1969-70 to 1983-84. From 1984-85 to 1991-92, the Mavericks competed at the NCAA Division III level, before returning to the NCAA Division II ranks from 1992-93 to 1995-96. Starting with the 1996-97 season, the Mavericks began competition at the NCAA Division I level. The Mavericks were granted acceptance to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in 1999-00, and remained with the conference until 2021.\nThe program saw great success at the NCAA Division II level during the 1970s and 1980s. The Mavericks finished as the NCAA Division II national runner-up in 1979, after being defeated by the University of Massachusetts Lowell 6-4 in the final. The Mavericks were awarded the 1980 NCAA Division II National Championship over Elmira College 5-2 in the championship game. In 1991, while competing at the NCAA Division III level, the Mavericks finished as national runner-up following a loss versus the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point 6-2. In 2013 and 2014, the Mavericks reached the NCAA Division I Tournament in consecutive seasons for the first time in program history. The program has seen sustained success in recent seasons, winning their conference tournament in three out of four tries from 2019 to 2023, and achieving the best record in their conference for six consecutive seasons from 2018 to 2023. In 2021, the Mavericks won their first NCAA Division I Tournament game in their first of two consecutive trips to the Frozen Four.\nOn March 29, 2017, the university announced that it was in negotiations to extend the contract of head coach Mike Hastings by 10 years (through the 2027-28 season), providing its coach with the longest contract term in all of Division I men's hockey. In addition to the contract extension, the university said it would invest further resources into the program's recruiting and equipment budgets and work to cover full cost of attendance.\nWith the 2021–22 season, the Mavericks, and six other teams formerly in the WCHA, began play in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, restarting the conference after an eight-year hiatus.\nOn March 30, 2023, head coach Mike Hastings left Mankato to coach Wisconsin. The Mavericks hired Luke Strand, former Ohio State assistant coach and Sioux City Musketeers head coach.\nMinnesota State is one of six Minnesota-based universities that compete in NCAA Division I ice hockey, the others being Minnesota, Minnesota-Duluth, St. Cloud State, Bemidji State, and St. Thomas. Before a major hockey conference realignment in 2013, five of the six teams all competed in the WCHA. Additionally, these same five schools once competed annually for the North Star College Cup, hosted by the University of Minnesota at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Minnesota State alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nMavericks in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "The Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Colorado College. The Tigers are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. They began play at Ed Robson Arena on the CC campus in Colorado Springs starting in the 2021 season.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 1938 Spencer Penrose and Charles Tutt developed plans to convert The Broadmoor's unused equestrian center into an indoor ice arena, known as the Broadmoor Ice Palace. After three weeks at a cost of $200,000 the Ice Palace opened and became the home of the Tigers Hockey program and the Broadmoor Skating Club. Colorado College Tiger Hockey began in 1938 playing in the Pikes Peak Hockey League with various local teams sponsored by Colorado Springs area businesses., The Tigers opened play on January 21, 1938 in a 1-8 loss to a team sponsored by Giddings Department Store. Garrett Livingston took over as head coach fin 1939 from John Atwood, who served as player/coach for the first season. Livingston increased recruiting, bringing players from Canada and New England and transitioned the program from the Pikes Peak Hockey League into an NCAA Division I independent program. The Tigers swept Michigan 4-2 and 4-3 in the program's first-ever intercollegiate series early in the 1939-40 season. That same season Colorado College also played games against Colorado School of Mines, Montana School of Mines, and the University of Southern California.\nThe program and college was suspended during World War II from 1942 to 1944. Colorado College, with the cooperation of The Broadmoor, sponsored the first National Collegiate Athletic Association Ice Hockey Championship to conclude the 1947-48 season. The tournament was held at the Ice Palace for the next 10 years, during which time CC participating seven times. Cheddy Thompson became the program's third head coach in 1945 after coming to Colorado Springs on assignment by the Air Force during the war. Thompson lead CC to the program's first NCAA championship in 1950 with a 13-4 win over Boston University. Colorado College became one of the founding members of the Mid-West Collegiate Hockey League (MWCHL) in 1951 with University of Denver, Michigan, Michigan State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota, and North Dakota. The league became the Western Intercollegiate Hockey League (WIHL) in 1953 and became the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) in November 1959. The Tigers also finished as runner-up in 1952 and 1955, losing to Michigan in both appearances in the championship game. In addition, he was named national Coach of the Year in 1952 by the United States Hockey Coaches Association. The Tigers returned to the championship game in 1957 with Tom Bedecki behind the bench. CC beat Clarkson 5-3 in the semifinal round and won the school's second hockey championship with a 13-6 win over Michigan. In 1961 the Ice Palace became known as the Broadmoor World Arena. The 1957 championship was the final appearance in the NCAA Tournament until 1978. The Tigers finished the regular season and captured the school's first and only WCHA Tournament Championship and received a bid to the NCAA Tournament, in the first round the Tigers lost to Bowling Green State 3-5.\nThe lean years.\nBedecki abruptly resigned in 1958, and the Tigers went into a decline that would last for almost four decades. From 1958 to 1993, the Tigers would have only three winning seasons. The low point came in 1961-62, when the Tigers finished with a 0-23 record, still the worst in school history.\nRecent history.\nIn 1993 Don Lucia became the head coach of the Tigers. In his first season, 1993–94, he led the team to win the MacNaughton Cup, given to the WCHA regular season champion. It was Colorado College's first Cup win since 1957. After serving as the Tigers' home ice for 55 years the Broadmoor World Arena closed in March 1994 and later demolished by The Broadmoor to make room for the resort's expansion. Colorado College was then invited by the Air Force Academy to play at their home ice, the Cadet Ice Arena until the new World Arena opened in 1998 on the southern side of Colorado Springs. The Tigers returned to the NCAA post season in 1995 for the first time since 1978. The Tigers lost in the quarterfinal round to Minnesota 2-5. The following season CC made a second straight NCAA tournament appearance, receiving a number one seed in 1996 NCAA Tournament. Colorado College beat UMass Lowell 5-3 in the quarterfinals and Vermont 4-3 in the semifinal round before losing to 2-3 in overtime to Michigan in the championship game. CC returned to the Frozen Four under Lucia for a second straight season in 1997 before losing to North Dakota 6-2. Lucia lead the Tigers to two additional NCAA Tournament appearances in 1998 and 1999 before leaving Colorado College to become head coach at Minnesota.\nScott Owens took over as head coach of the program in 1999 and lead the Tigers to three straight NCAA Tournaments in 2001, 2002, and 2003. In the 2005 Tournament The Tigers returned to the Frozen Four with a 4-3 victory over Michigan in the Midwest Regional Final. In the Semifinal round the Tigers fell to the eventual national champion and rival Denver 2-6. Owens lead CC to the NCAA Tournament again in 2006 Tournament and in 2008 Tournament, ending in first round exits both times. The Tigers returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2011. The Tigers upset the number one ranked team and defending National Champions, Boston College 8-4. The Tigers' win was led by freshman Jaden Schwartz, a first round draft choice of the St. Louis Blues making his St. Louis debut in the West Regional. The Tigers' season ended in the Regional final in a 1-2 loss to Michigan.\nNew arena in 2021.\nIn 2018, CC announced plans to build a new $38 million arena located on campus. The facility is named Edward J. Robson Arena in honor of 1954 CC alum and former Tigers hockey player Edward Robson. This is the Tigers' new home rink after playing at the World Arena since 1998.\nThe new arena has a capacity of 3,407, less than half that of World Arena. It features an NHL-sized rink instead of the World Arena's Olympic-size rink. Robson Arena sits around 6,050 feet above sea level, about 200 feet below the World Arena. Colorado College initially hoped for it to be ready for play by 2020. Changes made during the planning process, most notably the addition of a parking garage and a shift in the arena footprint within its city block, led to delays. The arena opened for the 2021–22 season.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award\nSpencer Penrose Award\nTim Taylor Award\nNCAA Division I Ice Hockey Scoring Champion\nNCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nWCHA Player of the Year\nWCHA Outstanding Student-Athlete of the Year\nWCHA Defensive Player of the Year\nWCHA Freshman/Rookie of the Year\nWCHA Coach of the Year\nMCHA / WIHL / WCHA Scoring Leader\nMCHA / WIHL / WCHA Goaltending Leader\nWCHA Most Valuable Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond team all-wcha\nThird Team All-WCHA\nWCHA All-Rookie Team\nNCHC.\nIndividual awards.\nNCHC Rookie of the Year\nNCHC Goaltender of the Year\nNCHC Defensive Forward of the Year\nHerb Brooks Coach of the Year\nNCHC Sportsmanship Award\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-NCHC\nSecond team All-NCHC\nNCHC All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Colorado College alumni who have played or coached on an Olympic team.\nColorado College Athletic Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Colorado College men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Colorado College Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nTigers in the NHL.\nOver 170 Colorado College alumni have gone on to play professionally, including over 30 current and former NHL players:\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Archery at the 2010 Commonwealth Games – Women's recurve individual",
        "text": "The women's recurve individual archery event at the 2010 Commonwealth Games was a competition held as part of the archery programme at the Yamuna Sports Complex in Delhi, India, from 4 October to 10 October 2010. It was the second time that the recurve individual event for women had been included in the Commonwealth Games and the first time it had been contested since the 1982 Games in Brisbane, Australia.\nIndia's Deepika Kumari and Dola Banerjee won the gold and bronze medal respectively, with Alison Williamson of England winning the silver medal, all firsts for their nations in the women's recurve individual event.\nBackground.\nA women's individual archery event had only taken place once before at the Commonwealth Games. As part of the 1982 Games held in Brisbane, Australia, a programme of two competitions using recurve bows took place over a four day period, with the women's individual event being held in parallel with a similar event for male archers. As one of sixteen designated optional commonwealth sports, archery's inclusion in a Commonwealth Games meeting is determined by the candidate host city on a Game-by-Game basis, subject to approval by the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth Games Federation. In 2006, India's Commonwealth Organising Committee was successful in its application to host individual and team archery events for its forthcoming Games in Delhi in 2010; the 28-year gap marked the longest period of absence for any returning Commonwealth sport. In addition to the men's and women's individual recurve events, six other archery competitions were approved — the men's and women's team recurve, and men's and women's individual and team compound events — each making their debut Commonwealth Games appearance.\n22 competitors from 10 nations qualified for the event. Australia, Canada, England, Malaysia, Singapore, and host nation India each entered a full berth of three archers. Kenya, Mauritius, Scotland, and Sri Lanka each qualified one athlete. Of the entrants, eight were former Olympians: India's Dola Banerjee and Bombayla Devi Laishram, England's Naomi Folkard and Alison Williamson, Australia's Deonne Bridger and Alexandra Feeney, Canada's Marie-Pier Beaudet, and Veronique Marrier of Mauritius. Only Williamson entered as an Olympics medalist, having won bronze at the 2004 Games in Athens. India's Deepika Kumari, the reigning women's recurve individual youth champion, entered as the highest ranked athlete at world number 5.\nSeven months before the competition began a four-day international test event was held at the Yamuna Sports Complex in March 2010 to evaluate the venue's preparedness ahead of the Games. Indian archers dominated the women's recurve individual competition, Kumari taking the gold medal in a five-set final ahead of teammates Chekrovolu Swuro and Pranitha Vardhineni, who finished with the silver and bronze medals respectively.\nTwo days after the opening ceremony in Delhi it was announced that all archery events were to be removed from the schedule of the succeeding 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow due to time constraints. As of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, this remains the last time archery was contested at a Commonwealth Games.\nFormat.\nThe event was an outdoor target archery competition held under International Archery Federation (\"Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc\", FITA) rules, with each archer shooting at a 122 cm-wide target from a 70-metre distance. Between one and ten points were awarded for each arrow depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target.\nThe competition consisted of six stages. A 72-arrow ranking round took place on 4 October with the total cumulative score of each archer, out of a maximum of 720, used to determine the seedings for the five elimination rounds. The twelve athletes with the lowest total score from their 72 arrows advanced to the 1/16 elimination round, while the 10 highest scoring athletes received a bye to the 1/8 elimination round. If two or more athletes posted the same total score, the number of arrows landing in the 10 ring was taken into account. If the number of 10s was tied, then the number of arrows landing within the inner-10 ring (noted as Xs) was used as a tiebreaker.\nA single elimination tournament consisting of five rounds followed, each round using the set system introduced by FITA earlier in 2010. A set consists of a total of six arrows, each archer shooting three arrows. The highest scoring archer from their three arrows earned two set points with the losing archer receiving zero points. In the event of a tied score both archers received one point. The 1/16 and 1/8 elimination rounds consisted of a maximum of three sets, with the first archer scoring four set points declared the winner, while the quarter-final, semifinal, and two medal-deciding matches consisted of up to five sets, the first archer to six set points winning the match. If the set points were tied after the maximum number of sets had been played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used, the archer shooting closest to centre of the target winning the match.\nSchedule.\nThe women's individual recurve began on 4 October with the ranking round, the results of which were also used to determine the seedings for the women's team recurve event. The first two elimination rounds took place the following day on 5 October, matches in the 1/16 and 1/8 elimination matches respectively taking place simultaneously. A break of four days then followed to allow the team recurve and the individual and team compound events to conclude. On the morning of 10 October the four quarter-final, two semifinal, and two medal matches were held in a staggered schedule each commencing thirteen minutes apart, the first quarter-final match beginning at 09:00, the first semifinal match at 09:52, and the gold medal match at 10:31. The medal presentation followed at 10:45.\nThe event was the seventh of the eight competitions on the archery schedule to conclude, the final rounds of the men's individual recurve following on the afternoon of 10 October.\nVenue.\nAll archery events took place at the Yamuna Sports Complex in a 1,500-seat outdoor facility constructed for the Games. Originally the complex was to host only the practice and ranking rounds, with the subsequent elimination rounds taking place within a temporary 3,000-seat facility on the lawns of India Gate in central Delhi. These plans were however abandoned in June 2010 after spiralling construction costs and the failure to obtain security clearance for the India Gate site due to its proximity with the centrepiece Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.\nRecords.\nAt the time of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, South Korea's Park Sung-hyun held the world record for a 72-arrow total score shot from a 70-metre distance, shooting a total of 682 one day before the start of the 2004 Summer Olympics. Because the 2010 Games were the first to use the 72-arrow ranking round format at any stage of the competition, no existing Commonwealth record in this category had been set prior to this event.\nReport.\nDola Banerjee was the pre-event favourite for the gold medal.\nStrong winds made shooting difficult on the final day of competition. Banerjee blamed the blustery conditions on her semi-final defeat to sixth seed Alison Williamson, in which she surrendered a one-set lead with three successive set losses, losing 6-2. She would however come back from one set down to defeat Malaysia's Anbarasi Subramaniam in the bronze medal match after Subramaniam shot poorly in the fourth set. Williamson was joined by top seed Deepika Kumari in the final, who had failed to win just one set in the previous three matches, thereby guaranteeing a maiden women's individual recurve medal for both nations.\nThe final marked the third time Kumari and Williamson had met competitively. Kumari had won both of their previous match-ups, in the women's team recurve event two days prior and in the second stage of the Archery World Cup in Antalya, Turkey four months earlier. The match was a lop-sided affair, and in a performance described by \"The Hindu\" as \"flawless\", Kumari outshot the Englishwoman in a straight sets victory, scoring a maximum 30 points in the third set while Williamson faltered with a score of 7 on her last arrow. Kumari's win earned her a second Commonwealth gold medal in three days following India's victory in the women's team recurve event two days before, making her the most successful recurve archer at the Games. After her defeat Williamson praised Kumari's shooting and the behaviour of the home crowd, whose conduct in the women's team final had come under criticism by fellow English archer Amy Oliver for excessive volume and poor sportsmanship."

        "text": "The RPI Engineers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). The Engineers are a member of ECAC Hockey (ECACH). They play at the Houston Field House in Troy, New York.\nHistory.\nMen's ice hockey at RPI dates back to 1901 and is one of the oldest programs in the United States. The team played as an independent NCAA Division I team from its inception in 1901 through 1938. The team resumed after World War II for the 1949–50 season, and in the following season Rensselaer joined Clarkson, Colgate, Middlebury, St. Lawrence, and Williams to form the Tri-State League for the 1950–51 season. The next three seasons, the 1952–1954 team won the Tri-State League season championships. RPI's first NCAA tournament berth in 1953, coming in third, and the following season in 1954 the team won its first NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Championship. After a six-year drought the program again made the NCAA tournament in 1961, finishing fourth. The 1960–61 season would be the last season RPI competed in the Tri-State League, as RPI and fellow Tri-State League members Clarkson and St. Lawrence joined the new ECAC Hockey League.\nDepending on how the rules are interpreted, the RPI men's ice hockey team may have the longest winning streak on record for a Division I team; in the 1984–85 season it went undefeated for 30 games, but one game was against the University of Toronto, a non-NCAA team. Continuing into the 1985–86 season, RPI continued undefeated over 38 games, including two wins over Toronto. Adam Oates and Daren Puppa, two players during that time, both went on to become stars in the NHL. Joe Juneau, who played from 1987 to 1991, also spent many years in the NHL. Graeme Townshend, who also played in the late 1980s, had a brief NHL career. He is the first person of Jamaican ancestry to play in the National Hockey League.\nTraditions.\nThe hockey team plays a significant role in the campus's culture, drawing thousands of fans each week to the Houston Field House during the season. The team's popularity even sparked the tradition of the hockey line, where students lined up for season tickets months in advance of the on-sale date. Today, the line generally begins a week or more before ticket sales. Another tradition since 1978 has been the \"Big Red Freakout!\" game held close to the first weekend of February. Fans usually dress in the schools colors Red and White, and gifts such as tee-shirts are distributed en masse.\nFrom 1995 to 2009, RPI's Division III teams were known as the Red Hawks. However the hockey, football, cross-country, tennis, and track and field teams all chose to retain the longstanding Engineers name. The Red Hawks name was, at the time, very unpopular among the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted with thrown concessions and chants of \"kill the chicken!\" This was a major factor behind \"Engineers\" being restored for all teams in 2009.\nThe official hockey mascot, The Puckman–an anthropomorphic hockey puck with an engineer's helmet–has always been popular.\nSeason.\nThe RPI Engineers men's ice hockey typically plays between 35 and 42 regular season games per season in the ECAC Hockey Conference. They also usually play one exhibition game against a Canadian college hockey team from Ontario, Nova Scotia, or Quebec. During the season, RPI will play 22 conference games against the other 11 teams in the ECAC. RPI will play each team home game at the Houston Field House and each away game at the respective university's campus. The conference games are typically played on Friday and Saturday nights, with the ECAC scheduling reflecting the Ivy League scheduling of having traveling partners. RPI's travel partner has been Union College since they joined the league in the 1991-92 season. They also play 10-12 non-conference games against teams not in the ECAC. These games typically take place at the beginning of the season in October and around the Thanksgiving and New Year holidays. RPI also plays one non-conference game against their Capital District geographic rival, Union, at the Times Union Center, typically on the last Saturday of January in what has become known as the Mayor's Cup. RPI has opened ECAC Hockey conference play on the last weekend of October against Union since the 2012–13 season. The first conference home game is known as Black Friday or Black Saturday which alternates each year. Other highlights of the season include the Big Red Freakout, which is played on the last or second to last Saturday home game in February.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season the team will play a minimum of two postseason games in the ECAC Hockey men's ice hockey tournament in the beginning of March. If RPI wins the ECAC Tournament or is invited to the NCAA tournament as an at-large team, they would then play at least one postseason game in late March in the single elimination tournament. RPI last played in the NCAA tournament in 2011.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical Leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nNCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nKen Dryden Award\nMost Outstanding Player in tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Rensselaer alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nEngineers in the NHL.\nSource:"

His career included spending a part the 1988 season in Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals. Arnold, a pitcher, compiled no record with a 5.40 earned run average (ERA) and eight strikeouts in six games, all in relief appearances during his major league career.

In his senior year at Miami, the St. Louis Cardinals selected Arnold in the fifth round of the 1984 Major League Baseball Draft.\nProfessional career.\nAfter being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1984, Arnold was assigned to play in their minor league organization with the Johnson City Cardinals of the rookie-level Appalachian League. With Johnson City, Arnold compiled a record of 4–5 with a 3.05 earned run average (ERA) in 14 games, 13 starts. Arnold then received a promotion to the Class-A Springfield Cardinals during that season and in one game, gave-up six runs (all earned) in six innings pitched.

Over his one season in the majors, Arnold compiled no record with a 5.40 ERA and eight strikeouts in six games, all in relief. On April 25, the Cardinals activated pitcher John Tudor from the disabled list and sent Arnold down to the minor leagues. During the month of May, the Cardinals considered recalling Arnold, who had been playing in their minor league organization, but it was not done. In the minors that season, Arnold played for the Double-A Arkansas Travelers and the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds. In June, Arnold was named the St. Louis Cardinals minor league player of the month. Between the two teams that season, Arnold went 10–7 with a 2.98 ERA in 24 games, all starts.\nDuring the 1989 season, Arnold played with the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds, who were minor league affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals. Before that season, he did play with the Cardinals during spring training, but was reassigned to the minors before the start of the regular season. With the Redbirds that season, Arnold compiled a record of 8–10 with a 3.97 ERA, two complete games, one shutout and 88 strikeouts in 34 games, 22 starts. Arnold split the 1990 season between the Double-A Arkansas Travelers and the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds. With the Travelers, he went 1–0 with a 2.62 ERA and 15 strikeouts in four games, all starts. At the Triple-A level, Arnold went 1–3 with a 6.08 ERA and 23 strikeouts in 14 games, four starts."

        "title": "Venues of the 1932 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "For the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, United States, a total of five sports venues were used. This was unchanged from the previous games in St. Moritz. For the first time in the history of the Winter Olympics, an indoor venue was used for the figure skating and six of the twelve ice hockey events at the Olympic Arena. The first bobsleigh venue outside Europe was constructed for use. Four different 18 km and five different 50 km venues were submitted for approval prior to the Olympics. After the 1932 games, three of these venues served as host for their respective championships that were held outside Europe for the first time.\nBefore the Olympics.\nThe first ski jump was constructed in Lake Placid in 1920. It had a hill. Three years later, the hill was rebuilt that was long. Finally, the hill was made long in 1927.\nCross-country skiing trails took place around the hills of Lake Placid. Maintenance of the trails were first done by the New York State Conservation Department (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation since 1970) Within a radius around Lake Placid at the time of the 1932 Games, there were worth of good ski trails. Despite this, an additional had to be built and were accurately measured with steel tape to the nearest in order to meet the requirements of the International Ski Federation (FIS). Four different courses for the 18 km event and five different courses for the 50 km event were submitted to the FIS.\nThe Stadium was constructed at the local high school. This purchase was approved by the village in 1929 following a series of local board meetings. A total was leased by the Park Commission from the Lake Placid Board of Education that would run until 2028. Construction began in December 1929 and was completed by November 1931. At the arena was a long, circular track used for speed skating.\nThe Arena was an idea of Godfrey Dewey, president of the Organizing Committee, after he saw what sudden thaws had done to the Winter Olympics both in Chamonix and in St. Moritz. A visit by International Olympic Committee President Count Henri de Baillet-Latour in September 1930 encouraged Dewey to construct the indoor arena. This was approved at a board meeting later that month to investigation. Discussions ensued among the Olympic organizers until a site was approved in April 1931. Property was purchased in June of that year followed by an approval of a municipal bond in July. Construction took place between August 1931 and January 1932. Over of steel pipes were laid down on the floor to help make the ice.\nThe Bob Run was constructed during August–December 1930 and opened on Christmas Day 1930. This was done after site selection was met with protest over the use of the track in state-owned lands.\nDuring the Olympics.\nIce hockey was initially scheduled to have ten of their twelve games at the Stadium while two would be at the arena. A thawing in the ice outdoors forced four of the hockey games to be moved indoors to the arena.\nWeather also gave problems for the four-man bobsleigh event that were so bad that it delayed the finals until after the closing ceremony. Officials wanted to have all four runs be done on 14 February. After the second run, American bobsledder F. Paul Stevens protested the racing conditions of the track by walking off. Most of the other bobsledders followed Stevens. The final two runs were set on the 15th as a result.\nThe 50 km event on 13 February was held in a raging blizzard. Skiers and officials argued about the course itself, delaying the start of the race for three hours. Despite this, it produced the closest 50 km race in Olympic history then when Finland's Veli Saarinen defeated his fellow countryman Väinö Liikkanen by 20 seconds. This record would stand until the 1968 Winter Olympics, when Norway's Ole Ellefsæter beat out the Soviet Union's Vyacheslav Vedenin by 16.7 seconds.\nAfter the Olympics.\nThree of the venues would become host to events that were held outside of Europe for the first time. After the 1932 Games, the Stadium hosted the World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Men (Women's would not take place officially until 1936.). The bob track would host the International Bobsleigh World Championships in 1949. In 1950, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, the ski jumping and the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined event took place at the ski jump used for the 1932 games."

        "text": "The 2007–08 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 86th season of play for the program and 24th in the Hockey East. They represented Boston College in the 2007–08 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. They were coached by Jerry York, in his 14th season and played their home games at the Conte Forum. The team won the 2008 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 3rd title in program history.\nSeason.\nAfter losing the national championship in the final minutes a year before, Boston College entered the year with a good deal of hope but also some uncertainty. 3-year starter, Cory Schneider forwent his senior season by signing a professional contract and BC would have to rely on three underclassmen to absorb the minutes. Fortunately, with the entire defensive corps returning, the young netminders would be insulated by a solid contingent. Up front the team lost their leading scorer from the year before, Brian Boyle but still returned most of the principle offense.\nInjury and suspensions.\nWith all the elements for a solid season, the Eagles were ranked high in the preseason polls. While they kicked off the year with an overtime loss to Michigan, much worse was to come in the aftermath. Brock Bradford, one of the team's leading point producers from last year, suffered a broken arm and would be out for months. Compounding their problems, Brett Motherwell and Brian O'Hanley, two of the leaders on defense, were given indefinite suspensions by head coach Jerry York. While the team was mum on the entire reason behind the suspensions, other than saying that the two had missed curfew, York indicated in November that neither would be back with the team 'any time soon'. As a result, both players ended up leaving the team and signing professional contracts during the year. The Eagles also lost a 4th player early in the year when freshman Ryan Hayes departed after just 6 games.\nIn the meantime, BC had to struggle through the early part of the season without three of its expected regulars. York had to shuffle his lineup and throw some of his newer players into the deep end of the pool. Surprisingly, it was the defense that held up best over the next several weeks. The biggest boon came from in goal where freshman John Muse took complete control of the starting role and kept the Eagles in contention for most games. Unfortunately, the offense was lacking without Bradford and by the Thanksgiving break, BC had both more losses and more ties than victories and had dropped out of both polls.\nResurgence and reinjury.\nA change to the lines just before the break appeared to work well and when the team returned in late November, the unit of Nathan Gerbe, Brian Gibbons and Ben Smith began to take over. The Eagles won their next five matches, averaging more than six goals per game over that stretch. After their winning streak was snapped by Clarkson, the Eagles welcomed Bradford back to the lineup on January 9. He replaced Smith on the top line and earned a point in each of his next four games. In the second period of the game at Boston University on January 19, Bradford broke his left humerus for a second time. While surgery was not required, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season.\nSmith rejoined the top line and BC continued to plug along despite the pall cast over the club. BC had a tough fight on its hands when it met for the 56th edition of the Beanpot. The Eagles got behind 2–3 to BU but a pair of goals from Gerbe, the second coming in overtime, sent BC to the championship game. Boston College faced Harvard in front of a raucous crowd and held a 1-goal lead going into the third. The two combined for 5 goals in the final frame, and ended up tied at 5-all at the end of 60 minutes. BC completely dominated the overtime session, outshooting the Crimson 7–0. Freshman Nick Petrecki became an instant hero for BC by scoring twice, including the game-winner, and giving the program its first Beanpot victory in 4 years.\nSlumping after the Beanpot.\nAfter the tournament victory, the offense for Boston College suddenly went silent. The Eagles went 1–5–1 over their next seven games and scored more than 2 goals in just one contest. The mounting losses put the Eagles in jeopardy of missing out on the postseason if they performed poorly in the Hockey East Tournament. As they began their postseason the Eagles were lumped in with teams with inferior records. Because both the CCHA and WCHA were considered to be stronger conferences, Boston College could not afford to flame out in their conference tournament.\nHockey East Tournament.\nDue in part to their late-season slump, Boston College opened the postseason against a ranked Providence team. BC got off to tremendous starts in both matches, scoring the first four goals in each contest and easily downing the Friars. While Gerbe scored twice in each contest, it was Muse's 68 saves that were the highlight for the series. The wins sent BC to the semifinal against league champion New Hampshire, who had swept BC in their season series. At the start it appeared that the Wildcats were going to go four for four when they jumped out to a 2–0 lead after one period. Ben Smith cut into the advantage but UNH followed that with two more goals, one on the penalty kill, to take a commanding 4–1 lead past the midway point of the game. BC redoubled its efforts and ended up firing 24 shots on the Wildcat goal in the second, managing to score twice more before the end of the frame to give them a fighting chance. A goal by Dan Bertram tied the score early in the third which is when both goaltenders took over. Both Muse and Kevin Regan stopped every shot for the next 55 minutes and pushed the game into a third overtime. 43 seconds into the 6th period, Benn Ferriero ended the match with his 16th goal of the season.\nDespite the potential hangover from the extended game, BC romped over an upstart Vermont squad in the final. BC repeated as tournament champions and earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA Tournament.\nDespite winning the conference championship, BC's record only earned them a 2nd seed for the Northeast Regional. Ben Smith kicked off the scoring for the Eagles in their first game in the opening period. After exchanging goals with Minnesota in the second, Boston College built a 4–1 lead in the third with scoring from their depth lines. The Gophers pulled their goaltender with 3:40 left after they got on the power play and cut into BC's lead. Muse held the fort afterwards and an empty-net goal from Gerbe salted the game away.\nThe biggest test for the Eagles was awaiting them in the regional final. #2 overall seed Miami, who had spent much of the year ranked #1, was a tournament favorite and lived up to their billing early in the game. The RedHawks opened the scoring just 90 seconds into the game but were held in check by BC's defense for the remainder of the period. Miami doubled their advantage midway through the second and appeared to be heading towards a victory. On a delayed penalty, BC pulled Muse and they were able to parlay the impromptu 6-on-5 into their first goal of the night. Just 14 seconds after the ensuing faceoff, Nathan Gerbe scored to tie the game. A minute and a half after that, Ben Smith gave BC their first lead of the game. The stunning turnaround put BC in the driver seat and kept the team's championship drive alive. While Miami tied the game in the third, neither team could get the winner before the buzzer sounded and BC headed to its 14th overtime game of the season. While BC may have been old hands at extra hockey, it was Miami who shelled the BC cage. Muse turned aside 10 shots in 12 minutes of game action and gave his team enough time to capitalize on their chances. A sprawled-out Joe Whitney swiped a rebound past Jeff Zatkoff to send BC to their third consecutive frozen four.\nCompared to their quarterfinal game, BC's match against North Dakota was less than thrilling. The Eagles scored four times in the opening frame and added two more in the second to take an almost insurmountable lead over the Fighting Sioux. Gerbe recorded a hat-trick to raise his total on the season to 33 and take over as the national leader in both goals and points. After the rather pedestrian 6–1 win, BC only had Notre Dame remaining in their path.\nIn the final game of the season, Boston College got off to a slow start but the first period ended up with just 12 shots combined. Notre Dame was only able to get the puck on goal 5 times despite having three separate power plays. While the Irish couldn't capitalize on their opportunities, BC took full advantage in the second, scoring twice on the man-advantage and adding a third at even strength to build a 3–0 lead. Notre Dame managed to score one of their own but BC's defense held and stopped the Fighting Irish from doing any more scoring for the remainder of the game. Smith netted the only marker of the third and the Eagles skated to a fairly comfortable victory, earning the third NCAA championship in program history.\nWith his hat-trick in the semifinal and contributing on every goal in the championship, Nathan Gerbe was the obvious choice for Tournament MOP.\nRecruiting.\nBoston College added five freshmen for the 2007–2008 season, including one defenseman, two forwards, and two goalies.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Nicholas James Phipps (born 9 January 1989) is an Australian rugby union player who played for the Australia national team and plays for Green Rockets Tokatsu in the Japan Rugby League One competition.\nEarly life.\nPhipps was educated at The King's School and in 2009 captained Sydney University's premiership-winning 1st Colts team.\nHe is currently studying a Masters of International Business at Sydney University.\nRugby playing career.\nClub level.\nPhipps signed to the Melbourne Rebels in July 2010. Phipps mentors for the 2011 Super Rugby season included former Wallaby halfback Sam Cordingley. Phipps said he was looking forward to learning from his fellow halfbacks, Cordingley, and Kingi, and also from Rebels centre (and former Wallaby) Julian Huxley.\nIn May 2012 Phipps combined with Kurtley Beale in the halves (9 &amp; 10) against the Bulls from South Africa. Beale had been moved from fullback to flyhalf following Danny Cipriani's unexpected departure from the Rebels. Phipps scored a try under the posts.\nPhipps moved back to Sydney to play for the Waratahs commencing 2014.\nRebels coach Damien Hill said, \"Nick has played a major part in laying the foundations of this Club and it is disappointing to see him leave. He replicates our team ethos in everything he does, both on a off the rugby field.\"\nThe Wallabies and Waratahs scrum half re-signed with the ARU and NSW Waratahs in January 2017 for a two-year contract extension that takes Phipps through to the end of the 2019 season. In March 2017 he brought up his 100th super rugby cap.\nOn 1 February 2019, Phipps travel to England to join London Irish in the English Premiership ahead of the 2019–20 season.\nInternational career.\nHis grandfather and great uncle, both called Jim, played for the Wallabies. Following the rich family culture within rugby Phipps made his international debut playing for Australia in the 2009 IRB Sevens World Series.\nPhipps played in the Australian Sevens at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, in Delhi. He scored a try and kicked eight conversions in his Games' debut. Australia went on to win Silver, losing the final to New Zealand.\nIn late 2010 Phipps toured with the Wallabies, and was named on the bench against the Leicester Tigers. In August 2011 Phipps became one of three halfbacks selected for the Wallabies in the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Phipps played 26 minutes for the Wallabies against Russia. He was one of three Rebels to play in the tournament, the others being new signings James O'Connor and Kurtley Beale. He has continued his international career playing and appearing in the bench frequently since his debut in the green and gold.\nAfter almost two years since Phipps started for the Wallabies on home soil, he was chosen for his 29th start in a Wallabies jersey in the third deciding test against Ireland.\nAs at 30 June 2018 Phipps has played in 64 Tests for the Wallabies since debuting at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand.\nPersonal life.\nPhipps married Ebony in 2018 and welcomed son Huxley in early 2019."

        "text": "Jack Gordon Parkinson (March 4, 1924 – May 29, 1997) was an American basketball player who is one of few players in National Collegiate Athletic Association history to win both the National Invitation Tournament (1946) and the NCAA tournament (1948). He also played one season in the National Basketball Association.\nEarly life.\nParkinson grew up in Yorktown, Indiana and attended Yorktown High School. A two-sport star, he earned varsity letters in baseball and basketball for all four years. In 1941–42, Parkinson's senior year, he led Delaware County in scoring for basketball and hit .500 in baseball. He also threw a no-hitter during the county baseball championship match. Parkinson was offered a contract by Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds, but his desire to play basketball for legendary Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp was so strong that he passed up a professional baseball opportunity to play for him.\nCollege and professional.\nParkinson earned four varsity letters as a member of the Kentucky men's basketball team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). He played for Rupp from 1943–44 through 1945–46 and again in 1947–48; during what would have been his true senior season, Parkinson was overseas for 11 months after enlisting in the Army.\nAs a freshman in 1943–44, he helped lead the Wildcats to a 19–2 overall record and win both the SEC regular season and tournament championships. He was named to the All-SEC First Team and All-SEC Tournament Team.\nIn 1944–45, the Wildcats once again were SEC regular season and tournament champions. Parkinson earned his second All-SEC First Team and All-Tournament Team honors while helping the team earn a berth in the NCAA tournament. They finished the season with a 22–4 record.\nParkinson's best collegiate season came as a junior in 1945–46. He averaged 11.3 points per game, earned his third consecutive All-SEC First Team and All-SEC Tournament Team selections while leading the Wildcats to yet more championships, and ultimately led them to win their first-ever NIT. They finished the season 30–2 and edged Rhode Island, 46–45, in the NIT championship game. Parkinson was named a consensus Second Team All-American as well. After the school year ended, he spent an 11-month stint in the Army, which put off his college career by one season.\nWhen Parkinson returned in 1947–48 for his senior season, he found himself relegated to coming off of the bench rather than starting, something which he had done for his whole career. He was playing behind what came to be known as Kentucky's \"Fab Five\" of Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, Cliff Barker, Kenny Rollins and Wallace \"Wah Wah\" Jones, which is one of Kentucky's most famous all-time teams. Kentucky would go on to win the SEC regular season and tournament as well as the 1948 NCAA Championship, but Parkinson's role in the success was greatly reduced from two years prior. Despite this, he would end his career with a distinguished collection of championships and accolades, including:\nJack Parkinson was selected in the 1949 BAA Draft by the Washington Capitols. He did not play in the league until , however, as a member of the Indianapolis Olympians. In only four career games, Parkinson scored three points. In addition to his brief NBA career, he also played with the Whiskered Wizards basketball team of St. Augustine, Florida, and with the Toledo Mercurys, who traveled with the Harlem Globetrotters.\nLater life.\nParkinson returned to Yorktown, Indiana and opened a wholesale plumbing and heating business in Muncie. He was elected into the Delaware County Athletic Hall of Fame and the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.\nHis son, Bruce G. Parkinson, was an All-American as a player at Purdue and still holds the school's record for career assists (690). Bruce led the Boilermakers to the 1974 NIT Championship and was the Captain of the 1975 Pan-Am Gold Medal Men's Basketball Team. Bruce was elected to the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004.\nThe Parkinsons are one of a handful of father-son pairs who have been elected to the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.\nHis grandson, Austin Parkinson, is the current head coach of the women's basketball team at Butler University. Austin was an Academic All-Big Ten point guard at Purdue; following a celebrated career in HS (Indiana All-Star, over 1,665+ points).\nJack Parkinson died on May 29, 1997, due to complications from a brain tumor.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

On November 15, 1919, Tucker, as a 17-year-old freshman, scored two touchdowns and kicked two extra points to lead the Second District Agricultural School Aggies to a 14–0 upset win over Jonesboro. In newspaper accounts following the game, Tucker and his teammates were referred to as \"Wonder Boys,\" and the nickname remains to this day. Tucker was labeled as \"The Original Wonder Boy\" and was associated with the school for the rest of his life. He went on to play on the University of Alabama's Rose Bowl team in 1931 and served Arkansas Tech in a variety of roles - including coach, athletic director and chemistry professor - between 1925 and 1972.

The games were part of the NBA's preseason schedule and allowed the Euroleague teams to display some of their very particular characteristics to the American public, even under NBA rules. The Euroleague teams that participated in the second edition were CSKA Moscow and Caja Laboral. On the other hand, the NBA franchises that played against them were the Miami Heat, the Memphis Grizzlies, the San Antonio Spurs, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nGames.\nIn the opening game on October 12, CSKA Moscow was determined to compete against the Heat even though they were playing without two starters, Victor Khryapa and J. R. Holden. Miami on the other hand was missing Dwyane Wade and needed LeBron James alongside Chris Bosh to step up. After a first half in which Ramūnas Šiškauskas and Trajan Langdon gave the opposite defense a tough challenge to face, CSKA was leading 44–39. In the second half James and Bosh were the leaders of a Heat comeback that eventually led to a 96–85 victory. They had 22 and 17 points respectively for the winners, whereas Langdon led all CSKA scorers with 20 points, Jamont Gordon had 17 and Šiškauskas 15.\nOn October 14, Caja Laboral fell short of a victory in Memphis against the Grizzlies, as they lost 110–105. Mike Conley Jr. led all scorers with 27 points, while Sam Young had 21. Mirza Teletović led the Spanish team with 24 points and 9 rebounds, Fernando San Emeterio scored 15 points and Marcelinho Huertas had an all-around performance with 7 points, 5 rebounds and 11 assists. The Thunder played the same day against CSKA in Oklahoma City, winning 97–89. Kevin Durant had 20 points, 5 rebounds and 7 assists for the winners, and Šiškauskas scored 17 for CSKA.\nThe last day of the tour was a history-changing one, as CSKA beat the Cavaliers to become the first international team ever to defeat an NBA franchise on US soil. In a game where both teams played without several key players (Khryapa and Holden for CSKA, Varejão, Parker, Jamison and Williams for the Cavs), the 2008 Euroleague MVP Ramūnas Šiškauskas made the difference by scoring 22 points and grabbing 5 rebounds. Jamont Gordon also was excellent with 19 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists, whereas Trajan Langdon's 14 points were more than crucial. Cleveland gave a strong fight mainly through Daniel Gibson who scored 21 points, Ryan Hollins who had 17 and Ramon Sessions with 14. In the other game of the night Caja Laboral was unable to threaten the Spurs in San Antonio losing 108–85. Tony Parker led the winners with 22 points, while David Logan and Mirza Teletović scored 20 and 18 respectively."

Following this, the Mohawk Lacrosse Club was formed in Troy in 1868 by several baseball players. As a game previously only played by Indigenous Americans, the Mohawk Lacrosse Club introduced lacrosse to people who had never seen it played through the formation of a club lacrosse program. This led to the formation of the modern game of lacrosse in the United States.\nIn its first season in the summer of 1868, the Mohawk Lacrosse club lost 4 games to Canadian teams, including Montreal Lacrosse Club, Crescent, Dominion and Aurora. Later, the team played a combination of college varsity and club games. In the 1974 season, the team had a 7 and 3 record, finishing 3rd in the Yankee Division of the United States Lacrosse Club Association.

The tournament was hosted by Adamson University. ABS-CBN covered the games on Studio 23.\nAt the end of the elimination round, the FEU Tamaraws finished on top of the team standings; the defending champions De La Salle Green Archers was tied with the Ateneo Blue Eagles and the UE Red Warriors for second. By virtue of a better point differential from games among the three teams, La Salle clinched the second seed; Ateneo and UE played for the #3 seed, a game Ateneo won. FEU and La Salle won convincingly against Ateneo and UE respectively in the semifinals to set up a rematch of the previous year's finals series. In the finals, the FEU Tamaraws defeated De La Salle Green Archers in two close games (both games were decided in the final minute) to win the championship.\nFEU Tamaraw Arwind Santos was named season and finals Most Valuable Player.\nAt the end of the tournament, La Salle returned their 2005 runner-up and 2004 championship trophies to the league after it was revealed they fielded two ineligible players. The league decided to suspend La Salle for the succeeding season in both divisions for all events, and the 2004 championship trophy was awarded to FEU.\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nThird seed playoff.\nSince La Salle, Ateneo and UE finished the eliminations with identical 10-4 cards, the quotient system was used. La Salle emerged with the best quotient among the three, so UE and Ateneo figured for a one-game playoff for the third seed. The winner will face the second seed, while the loser will face the first seed. The top two seeded teams possess the twice-to-beat advantage.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nBoth FEU and La Salle only has to win once in the series, while their opponents have to win twice to qualify for the Finals.\n(1) FEU vs. (4) UE.\nFirst seed FEU Tamaraws eliminated the UE Red Warriors 78–57. FEU coach Bert Flores remarked that one of the reasons why Arwind Santos skipped the 2005 PBA Draft was to win the championship for the year after losing last year's championship series.\n(2) La Salle vs. (3) Ateneo.\nWith La Salle routing Ateneo in their two elimination round games, Ateneo's LA Tenorio led the Eagles in the first half, with the Eagles leading by three points at halftime. Tenorio will finish the game with a team-high 20 points, along with six rebounds, three assists and four steals. La Salle's go-to guy Joseph Yeo scored 23 of his 28 points in the second half to blow the game wide open; he led the 11–0 run at the third quarter to erase Ateneo's three-point halftime lead to a 43–31 La Salle lead. Ateneo will not catch up, and La Salle qualifies for the finals with a 74–57 victory.\nFinals.\nThe Finals is a best-of-three series; the team that wins twice wins the championship.\nGame 1.\nLa Salle led for much of the first half, leading 43–29. Arwind Santos led a 13–0 run to trim the lead by one point at halftime. FEU led for the third quarter, but La Salle cut the gap to one point at the end of that quarter. La Salle continued their run at the fourth quarter, capped off by Joseph Yeo who gave the lead to La Salle 73–70 with 1:37 left in the game. Later, Santos made a three-pointer to tie the game at 73–all with 48.6 seconds left. With La Salle failing to score on their possession, Santos scored on a put-back with 5.5 seconds remaining. JV Casio missed a three-pointer at the other end, and Rico Maierhofer missed the put-back to clinch FEU's game 1 victory. Yeo finished with 26 points, while Santos had a double-double of 29 points and 14 rebounds. At the end of the game, La Salle assistant team manager Manny Salgado rushed to the court and hit Santos at the back of the head. The act was seen on national television.\nFEU coach Bert Flores had to be restrained as he tried to go after Salgado who had run for safety. Salgado later said that while Santos and Yeo were exchanging words, he tried to pacify them but Santos uttered some foul words. Salgado lost his temper and threw a closed fist at the back of Santos' head. Salgado later issued an apology as La Salle condemned the act and will accept the decision of the UAAP Board. Subsequently, the UAAP Board unanimously banned Salgado for life at all UAAP events, the stiffest penalty on a team official.\nGame 2.\nThe Tamaraws led at the end of first quarter by eight points, but La Salle cut the lead to two by halftime. In the third quarter, Ryan Araña scored three three-pointers to put La Salle up by 11. The Tamaraws cut the lead to three early in the fourth quarter, capped off by Jeff Chan's three-point play. La Salle would still lead up to the final minute when Yeo fouled Mark Isip, who converted the three-point play to put FEU up 72–71. La Salle failed to score on their next possession, and they fouled Jonas Villanueva, who split his free-throws to end the game. Santos was named Finals MVP after having another double-double performance with 14 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks.\nAwards.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's awards\" /&gt; \nLa Salle's suspension.\nOn August 15, La Salle had received reports that the papers of their men's basketball players Mark Benitez and Tim Gatchalian were spurious. However, they took no action until a month later when the allegations were made public. At the end of the finals series, La Salle voluntarily gave up the 2004 championship trophy and the 2005 runner-up trophy to the league. The league, on April 22, 2006, suspended La Salle for the following season in all sports and in both Seniors and Juniors divisions for negligence, \"as La Salle violated existing UAAP rules and regulations when it submitted the documents of Mark Benitez and Tim Gatchalian during the 2003-2004 season which proved to be spurious.\""

The ski jump was not used in FIS Ski Jumping World Cup until the 1980-81 season when it was won by Norway's Roger Ruud. Its last World Cup event was in 1998 and was won by Finland's Janne Ahonen. A final ski jumping event listed was a Continental Cup in February 2001, but no results were listed. The last cross-country skiing event after the 1937 championships was a Continental Cup event in 1999. This was a women's 10 km event won by Germany's Steffi Völkel and a men's 15 km event won by Spain's Jordi Ribo. As for Nordic combined, two more events have taken place since the 1937 championships though they were World Cup B events. The last Nordic combined event held in Chamonix was a World Cup B event in 2000 and was won by France's Kevin Arnould.\nThe bobsleigh track was demolished and is now used as an alpine skiing venue.\nThe Olympic Stadium is still in existence in Chamonix.\nChamonix was part of Annecy's unsuccessful bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics in July 2011.

England's Laura Turner and Australia's Sally Pearson had a simultaneous false start, but only Turner was initially disqualified, \"on the grounds that her reaction time was the quicker\". Turner refused to leave the track, and officials eventually authorised her to run \"under protest\", meaning that her time would not be recorded unless her disqualification was overturned. She finished last, and her time was not recorded. Pearson won the race, but admitted afterwards that she had \"twitched first\" out of the starting blocks, and England and Nigeria both requested that she be disqualified for her false start; her disqualification would enable Nigeria's Oludamola Osayomi to claim gold, and England's Katherine Endacott to claim bronze. Pearson was disqualified, and expressed tearful disappointment at having been \"told [she] was clear\": \"I did my victory lap with the flag. I was walking out to the medal ceremony and then I was called back. That's not right\". Australia counter-appealed, unsuccessfully.\nOn 11 October it was reported that supposed gold medal winner Oludamola Osayomi was the first person to test positive for banned substances during the 2010 Games, returning a positive doping test for the stimulant methylhexaneamine. Osayomi was provisionally suspended pending the results of testing on her B sample. It was reported that the positive testing was the result of prescription medication for a toothache. When the B sample also tested positive Oludamola Osayomi was stripped of her 100m gold medal and Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and the Grenadines was promoted to the gold medal, while English runner Katherine Endacott was promoted to the silver medal (having originally placed fourth) and Cameroon's Bertille Atangana, who originally placed fifth will receive bronze.\nHeats.\nFirst 4 in each heat (Q) and 4 best performers (q) advance to the Semifinals."

Unlike the previous year's edition, the 1994 event was run over just a single race. Paul Radisich won the event for a second time, while Germany was the winning nation. The winning driver was also awarded the RAC Tourist Trophy, the first time the Trophy had been awarded since 1988.\nReport.\nInitially, it was John Cleland that made the best getaway, vaulting from his grid position of fourth to take an early lead from front-row starters Paul Radisich and Steve Soper. Several drivers meanwhile, including Shaun van der Linde, Kieth O’Dor, Jan Lammers, David Leslie and Philippe Gache were eliminated from the race almost immediately after a multi-car collision in the middle of the pack. Later in the lap, Alain Menu clouted the rear of Frank Biela's Audi on the approach to the Melbourne Hairpin, resulting in the Swiss driver's retirement. It was at this point the red flags were shown to allow the numerous stranded cars to be moved.\nAt the restart, Cleland failed to replicate his excellent start, the top four rounding the first corner in grid order. Stefano Modena rammed the rear of Anthony Reid's Vauxhall at the Esses on the first lap, taking both men out of the race, whilst Gabriele Tarquini's late braking two corners later at Goddards resulted in the retirement of both Cleland and Emanuele Pirro, both of whom had passed Tarquini at the previous corner. Tarquini continued but lost several positions as he recovered from the grass.\nThis promoted Tim Harvey into third position behind Radisich and Soper, but his retirement due to head gasket failure ended a miserable day for the Renault team. Biela thus assumed third position from Joachim Winkelhock and Roberto Ravaglia, though the latter would soon lose fifth position after being pressured into out-braking himself at the Esses by a resurgent Tarquini and Yvan Muller. Whene it missed just 6 laps to the end Winkelhock decided to push out at the Esses his compatriot Biela as the pair battled for third position. This made loose Biela two positions behind Winkelhock and Tarquini, though the German would then beach his Audi in the gravel at Coppice the following lap as he attempted to catch them up .\nRadisich was able to maintain his healthy advantage over Soper to secure his second consecutive World Cup, with Winkelhock holding off Tarquini to complete the podium. After Biela's retirement, Hans-Joachim Stuck finished in fifth after qualifying in a lowly 21st, with Johnny Cecotto, Muller and Markus Oestrich rounding out the top eight finishers. Soper and Winkelhock's podium finishes were sufficient for BMW to win the manufacturers title, whilst the efforts of Winkelhock, Stuck and Oestrich secured Germany the Nations Cup.\nRace Results.\nQualifying\nRace"

        "title": "2002 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2002 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2002 NRL season. It took place on Sunday, 6 October 2002, at Sydney's Telstra Stadium. 80,130 people saw the Sydney Roosters beat the New Zealand Warriors 30–8. The Clive Churchill Medalist was Craig Fitzgibbon of the Sydney Roosters. The match was also broadcast live in the United States by Fox Sports World.\nBackground.\nThe 2002 NRL season was the 95th season of professional rugby league football in Australia and the fifth to be run by the National Rugby League. Fifteen teams competed for the Minor premiership which, after the Bulldogs were relegated to the bottom of the ladder for salary cap breaches, was claimed by the New Zealand Warriors. The top eight finishing teams were then reduced to two over the finals series.\nSydney Roosters.\nThe 2002 Sydney Roosters season was the 95th in the club's history. Coached by Ricky Stuart and captained by Brad Fittler, they finished the NRL's 2002 Premiership regular season in 4th place.\nNew Zealand Warriors.\nThe 2002 New Zealand Warriors season was the 8th in the club's history. Coached by Daniel Anderson and captained by Stacey Jones and Kevin Campion, they finished the NRL's 2002 Premiership regular season in 1st place.\nTeams.\nIt was the final game for Warriors fullback Ivan Cleary and Roosters winger Brett Mullins before their playing retirements.\nMatch details.\nBoth teams entered the cauldron of Telstra Stadium with great form heading into the contest. The Warriors had won their 2 Finals matches they had had. In Week 1 they beat the Canberra Raiders 36–20 in Auckland, before beating the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 16–10 at Telstra Stadium. The Roosters had beaten the Sharks 32–20 at the Sydney Football Stadium, then beating the Newcastle Knights in Sydney. Finally they beat the Brisbane Broncos (whom the Roosters were beaten by in the 2000 decider) in Sydney again.\nA pre-match performance by Billy Idol was attempted but due to a power outage had to be aborted.\n1st half.\nThe opening minutes were spent with both teams trading blows, the Roosters mainly with the upper hand. However it took till the 23rd minute for the deadlock to be broken, the Roosters scoring through Shannon Hegarty. Craig Fitzgibbon converted the try and the Sydney Roosters led 6–0. Soon, the Warriors found their rhythm and Ivan Cleary got a penalty goal to make the score 6–2 to the Roosters. It remained that way to half time, the Sydney Roosters holding the upper hand over the New Zealand Warriors.\n2nd half.\nThe second half started rather differently. Within 6 minutes the New Zealand Warriors took the lead. Stacey Jones darted over and the Warriors had the lead when Ivan Cleary converted from in front for a 6–8 score to the New Zealand Warriors. As the game approached its final quarter, a brilliant 40–20 from Roosters five-eighth and captain Brad Fittler saw the Roosters outfit on the front foot again. Craig Wing crashed over, Craig Fitzgibbon converted and the Roosters had a 12–8 lead. It looked as though it was going to be a tense finish but tries to Fitzgibbon, Chris Flannery and Bryan Fletcher as well as 3 conversions from Fitzgibbon meant the Sydney Roosters ran out 30–8 victors over the New Zealand Warriors. The grand final victory ended a 27-year premiership drought at the club.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nWorld Club Challenge.\nThe Sydney Roosters' victory in the Grand Final meant that they gained the right to travel to England and play in the World Club Challenge against the winners of the 2002 Super League grand final winners, St. Helens."

The team's schedule included victories over Maryland and Indiana. The team posted a 16–9 overall record and a 9–5 conference record.\nAlthough Hummer repeated as an All-Ivy League first team selection, Petrie failed to do so and was a second team selection. However, Petrie was a third team All-American selection by the \"Basketball News\" and repeated as an All-East selection. Petrie and Hummer were the only Tiger teammates to both be drafted in the first round of the NBA draft (in the same draft no less) when they were selected eighth and fifteenth overall in the 1970 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and the Buffalo Braves. The two were part of a trio of 1970 NBA first-round draftees from the Ivy League that included number thirteen selection Jim McMillian of Columbia. Hummer was the first NBA draft pick by the expansion Buffalo Braves. Petrie would share the 1971 NBA Rookie of the Year Award with Dave Cowens. Brian Taylor was selected in the 1972 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 23rd overall selection in the second round while Reggie Bird was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 55th overall selection in the fourth round.

Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout."

        "text": "The 2004 European Open was the 2004 edition of the European Open snooker tournament, held from 1 to 6 March 2004, at the Hilton Conference Centre, Portomaso, Malta. It was the final year the event was known as European Open, as the event was renamed to Malta Cup in next year. Stephen Maguire defeated Jimmy White by nine to three (9–3) in the final to claim his first ranking-event title, transforming him from \"talented underachiever into a world-ranking event winner\", according to \"The Times\". In the semi-finals Maguire defeated Stephen Lee and White beat Tony Drago. The tournament was the fifth of eight WPBSA ranking events in the 2003/2004 season, following the Welsh Open and preceding the Irish Masters.\nTournament summary.\nPrior to the 1988/1989 season no ranking tournament had been continuously staged outside of the United Kingdom (although the World Championship had been held twice in Australia). The snooker governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), decided to include overseas events and the first two locations chosen were Canada and Europe. The European Open was first held in 1989 in Deauville, France, and was suspended for 1997/1998 and 2000/2001. It moved to the Hilton Conference Centre, Portomaso, Malta for the first time in 2004 and was renamed the Malta Cup the following season.\nThe 2004 tournament was the fifth of eight WPBSA ranking events in the 2003/2004 season, following the Welsh Open and preceding the Irish Masters. Held in January, the Welsh Open was won by Ronnie O'Sullivan, who defeated Steve Davis by nine to eight (9–8) in the final. The defending European Open champion was also O'Sullivan, who defeated Stephen Hendry 9–6 in last year's final. Paul Hunter, who had defeated O'Sullivan in the final of the non-ranking Masters in February, entered the tournament \"playing the best snooker of his career\", according to Phil Yates of \"The Times\".\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying stage was played between players ranked 17 and those ranked lower for one of 16 places in the final stage. The matches were best-of-9 frames until the semi-finals. In March 2004 Maltese player Tony Drago defeated Adrian Gunnell 5–2 in a match held over from the qualifying stage in November.\nRound 1.\nThe qualifiers went through to face members of the top 16. In this round, Davis came from 2–4 down to beat Joe Swail 5–4, in a match where both players missed chances. In the deciding frame, Davis won on the pink ball after Swail had missed the brown. After the match, Davis said it was a historic day as he had never won a match in the country. Stephen Lee received a walkover to the next round after his opponent Robin Hull withdrew due to medical reasons. World number 41 Stephen Maguire made a of 89 in the final frame of his match against Peter Ebdon to win 5–4, and world number three O'Sullivan opened his match against Marco Fu with a century break of 110 and went on to win 5–1. Chris Small, who suffers from the spinal condition ankylosing spondylitis, whitewashed UK champion Matthew Stevens 5–0, in a match lasting almost three hours and which saw Stevens lose two frames on the black ball. Neil Robertson defeated Ken Doherty 5–3, and Joe Perry beat David Roe by the same scoreline. In the last match of the day, David Gray beat Fergal O'Brien 5–3.\nWorld number one Mark Williams was defeated 1–5 by Anthony Hamilton, who made a break of 133. Williams refused to answer questions at the post-match press conference, explaining: \"I'm not saying anything because if I do I could be in trouble so I'm keeping my mouth shut.\" Hunter and Hendry made high breaks of 49 and 55 in defeating Brian Morgan and Jimmy Michie 5–1, respectively. After the match Hendry—the world number two and a seven-time world champion said \"I feel like going to apologise to each fan one by one because it was such a bad match\". John Higgins whitewashed Barry Pinches 5–0, compiling a 132 break in the last frame in a match where Pinches made a high break of 33. Jimmy White overcame James Wattana 5–4 having trailed 2–3. Graeme Dott defeated Drew Henry 5-3 and Quinten Hann beat Simon Bedford 5–0. In the last game of the day, Drago beat Alan McManus 5–4.\nRound 2.\nIn round two O'Sullivan defeated Small 5–1, coming from behind to win in each of the first three frames with breaks of 58, 81, and 46. A break of 112 completed the victory, after which O'Sullivan said his opponent had made him work. In the fifth frame O'Sullivan continued playing despite needing snookers, later explaining, \"I wanted to keep playing because I was enjoying it so much\". White made breaks of 72, 52, 69, 51, and 65 in defeating Hendry 5–3, after which Hendry said his performance was \"horrendous\", and White said his refusal to go out the night before contributed to his performance. In the sixth frame White led by 41 points before missing an easy red, allowing Hendry to win on the black with a 55 break to level at 3–3. White dominated the next two frames for the victory. Higgins, without a tournament victory for over two years, whitewashed Dott 5–0 with breaks of 82, 81, 57, and 52, and said it was the \"best [he had] felt for ages\". Drago defeated Hunter 5–2 to reach the quarter-finals of a ranking events for the first time since 1998, in a low-quality match where Drago made one break over 50. Lee defeated Davis 5–3 in a four-hour match, and Higgins completed a second whitewash when he beat Dott 5–0, bringing his career record against Dott to 9–1. Maguire defeated Perry 5–4 to reach his first ranking quarter-final, and Hann beat Hamilton 5–1 to claim the final place in the next round.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals Lee defeated O'Sullivan 5–4 in a match that lasted 3 hours and 32 minutes. O'Sullivan came from 2–3 down to lead 4–3 before Lee leveled the match. In the final frame O'Sullivan led 36–0, before Lee made a 46 break and fluked a snooker that enabled him to claim victory. O'Sullivan said his performance was very poor, while Lee said he was quietly confident. White defeated Robertson 5–3 to reach his third semi-final of the season. White led 4–1 and was 56 points ahead in the sixth but missed a straightforward green, allowing Robertson to win on the black with a 67 break. Robertson took the next frame before a risky long pot in the eighth allowed White to win the match. White—who last won a ranking title 12 years ago prior at this event—said, \"Everyone knows I've been in front so many times in the past and tossed it away so I was having nightmares out there\". Drago quickly won the first four frames of his match against Hann, conceding the fifth, before completing a 5–1 victory, after which he said the crowd support helped him. Maguire caused an upset when he beat Higgins 5–3, a match that saw Maguire lose the first two frames before winning the next four. After the match Maguire he said he had \"starting to think about winning it now\".\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were best-of-11 frames. White reached his first final in four years when he defeated Drago 6–4. Leading 4–1 White made a break of 104 to win the sixth frame, before missing a straightforward red to allow his opponent to win the seventh with an 84 break. Drago won the next two in 15 minutes with breaks of 44 and 109—completing the latter in four minutes—before an 86 break gave White the victory, after which White said, \"Playing Tony here, I got a taste of what players have against me at the Masters when the crowd are all on my side but they were fair and I enjoyed every minute of it.\"\nIn the other semi-final Maguire beat Lee 6–4 in an error-strewn match which lasted four hours. After winning the first two frames Maguire lost the next three, but \"kept his cool\" to seal the victory. Maguire said the match was a \"battle\" and that he was surprised at how badly his opponents had played in the tournament, while Lee said he \"just blew up\" and that, \"When you’re as poor as that you get into such a state of mind that you can’t think straight\".\nFinal.\nThe match was White's 23rd appearance in a final and his first since the 2000 British Open. In the best-of-17 final Maguire defeated White 9–3 to win his first ranking title at the age of 22, earning £48,000 in prize money. The victory, according to \"The Times\", transformed Maguire from \"talented underachiever into a world-ranking event winner\";\n according to BBC Sport his victory was a surprise.\nIn the afternoon session Maguire made two sizeable breaks and one of 137 to lead 3–0. He won the next frame and compiled a century in the fifth. The sixth frame was awarded to Maguire, when White violated the three-miss rule. in the jaws of a corner pocket, White twice attempted to hit the pack of five reds off a side cushion and missed. On his third attempt he adopted a slow roll to the pack and again missed. In the evening session, trailing 0–6, White won his first frame before the next four were shared, the last of which included a break of 125 by White. At 8–2 a break of 57 gave Maguire the victory.\nAfter his victory Maguire acknowledged the influence of Terry Griffiths who had been working with him on the mental side of the game: \"He's been on the phone just telling me to keep calm and that I can do it if I believe in myself\". Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, \"Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win\" and, \"He gave me a good bashing. I'm pleased for him because he's a nice lad but I'm disappointed because I didn't compete\".\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nMain draw.\nNumbers to the left of the players' names are the tournament seedings.

        "title": "George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues",
        "text": "George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues, or Khoury League, is a non-profit organization in St. Louis, Missouri that runs youth tee ball, baseball, and softball leagues internationally. It is the longest operating youth baseball program in the United States.\nThe Khoury Association is operated by an all-volunteer Board of Governors. Local leagues can structure themselves in a way that can best serve their community; the Khoury Association sets few restrictions. The Khoury Association offers programs from ages four and up in a structure that allows kids to move up in a progressive format with balls, field dimensions, etc.\nHistory.\nThe first Khoury league was baseball league founded by George M. Khoury in 1934. He wanted an organized baseball league for his sons that allowed them to play the game with their own age groups. As George G. Khoury Sr. later recalls in his book, \"Brothers, Bombshells, and Baseball\", “Dad knew many people, was a salesman and an organizer.[...] He knew how to get things done, thus one evening he decided to form his own league and the Sixteenth Ward Baseball League, with George Khoury as the sponsor, was started in St. Louis. MO.”\nIn 1936, George M Khoury and attorney Maury Karner created the George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues, Inc. The first Khoury Association games were played on Mother’s Day in St. Louis's Forest Park. Khoury insisted that every child be allowed to play, regardless of skill level, and adopted the motto, \"The Khoury League Is Interested In The Child That Nobody Else Wants.\"\nThe Khoury Association expanded rapidly after World War II, first to the areas adjacent to St. Louis, then to Illinois, Kentucky, Florida and other states. In 1958, the Khoury Association created the first organized youth girls softball league in the United States. \nProgram.\nThe Khoury Association is a non-profit, nondenominational organization of affiliated circuits and leagues, using a hub system of control and administration. The International office in St. Louis serves in an administrative and advisory capacity. The Association administers anything from one four‐team league to a network of leagues within a 125‐mile radius of a large town or city serving as the network hub, however, the Association is flexible enough to operate larger circuits, such as State or Regional.\nRules.\nThe Khoury Association uses rules that are reviewed and updated annually by a rules committee with representatives from multiple local leagues.\nPlaying Divisions.\nThe Khoury Association was the first national sports program to separate youth players into divisions based on age. Players graduate as a team as they progress through the program. \nSpecial rules at the Atom and Pixie levels help the younger children learn how to play baseball. These rules include no base stealing, no balks, and no infield fly . Tee ball divisions are operated and determined by the local Khoury League.\nBaseball\nSoftball\nMost leagues have different rules and guidelines for their tee ball divisions that cater to their community's needs. Some Khoury Leagues also offer soccer, basketball, and bowling.\nField Dimensions.\nThe Khoury Association was the first program to use smaller ball fields and balls for the younger age divisions. There are three different field dimensions for baseball and three for softball. Tee ball field dimensions are determined by the local Khoury League.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Khoury Association was the first program to organize playoffs for all teams with others of equal standing in their divisions. The Association also pioneered an all-star game in a Major League Baseball park (Sportsman's Park in St. Louis) for certain divisions.\nNotable Participants.\nHonorary Lifetime Members.\nThese members include sportscaster Jack Buck, sportsman Gussie Busch., William DeWitt Sr., William D. Montgomery, Joseph A. Mueller, Bill Veeck, and Bernhard Winkleman.\nNational Recognition.\nAt its 60th Anniversary Dinner, hosted in 1996 by the Belleville Khoury League, Inc. (the oldest and longest continuing operating Khoury League), the Khoury Association received a letter of congratulations from President Bill Clinton, “For its dedication to our community youth.”\nAt a Banquet in 2003 in St. Louis, a letter from President George W. Bush was received acknowledging the Khoury Association's over 65 years of service to the United States.\nKhoury Alumni in Major League Baseball.\nUmpire Davey Phillips, and players Dal Maxvill, Homer Bush and Mike Shannon.

This was the first Derby where $2 win wagers were available.\nThe Derby in 1889 was an exciting one for fans as thousands packed into Churchill Downs (then called the Louisville Jockey Club) to see the field of eight take on the reigning Two-Year-Old Champion Proctor Knott. It was the largest crowd the track had seen since the Ten Broeck–Mollie McCarty match race in 1878, with an estimated 16,000 in attendance.\nRidden by Tennessee native Tom Kiley and sent off at 6-1 odds, Spokane got on the rail and closed in the stretch to the cheers of the crowd, running down the Proctor Knott to win by a nose in the final strides. In a time before photo finish, it was left to the judges who awarded the win to Spokane after deliberation. \nHe set a new Kentucky Derby record for 1½ miles at 2:34.50, nearly beating the record set by Luke Blackburn in 1880. \nSpokane is the only Montana-bred horse to win the Derby, and his win came the same year Montana became a state, when it joined the Union on November 8, 1889."

        "title": "1893 Stanley Cup championship",
        "text": "The Stanley Cup, then named the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, was first awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) at the end of the 1893 AHAC season for having placed first in the standings with a 7–1–0 record. The season ended on March 17, but Montreal was officially presented with the trophy on May 15.\nRefusal of the Stanley Cup.\nThe Montreal Hockey Club was affiliated with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association. In April 1893, the Stanley Cup was ready for presentation for its first winners. The cup's trustees, P. D. Ross and John Sweetland, made preparations to present the Cup to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (MAAA) on May 15, 1893, at the association's general meeting. However, behind the scenes, the members of the Montreal Hockey Club (MHC), told the MAAA board of directors not to accept the trophy as they wished to receive the trophy themselves and to wait until Club representatives \"had an opportunity of learning the conditions upon which the said trophy was to be held.\" MAAA president James A. Taylor refused both demands and the MAAA board of directors met and agreed to accept the trophy at the annual meeting. The Cup was presented to MAAA president Taylor, instead of MHC president James Stewart.\nThe Cup remained in the possession of the MAAA. At the same annual meeting that the MAAA had accepted the Cup, MHC president Tom Paton was named president of the MAAA. Paton raised the matter of the refusal in November to the MAAA, and a MAAA sub-committee met with the MHC. According to the committee, the Club felt slighted that it had been communicated with directly by the Cup trustees and would not accept the trophy unless all differences between the MHC and the MAAA were resolved.\nAt that time, the MHC made a request for a loan of $175 to cover season start-up expenses. The MAAA refused the loan, apparently the first time that the MAAA had refused the MHC any request. The MAAA decided to ask the Stanley Cup trustees for advice, and before they did, the MHC wrote to the trustees, stating that the club had not received the trophy and \"would like to know when to apply for same.\" Cup trustee Ross replied that they were willing to receive any advice \"to aid in the proper execution of Lord Stanley's wish to present this Cup to the champions of the Dominion.\"\nThe Cup transfer was settled in February 1894 when Ross travelled to Montreal to attend the AHAC meetings and attend a hockey game with his brother Jim Ross, who was a MAAA board member. Ross met with MHC president Stewart as well. After the meetings, letters from Sweetland and Ross were sent to both the MAAA and to the MHC. Sweetland and Ross asked that the MAAA \"are hereby requested and authorized to deliver the Stanley hockey challenge cup, which they have kindly had in their care, to the order of Mr. J. A. Stewart, president of the Montreal Hockey Club.\"\nThe club received the trophy between March 5 and March 15, 1894. But the matter did not end there. On March 22, MHC defeated Ottawa to retain the trophy. The club, per the Cup conditions, arranged to have its name engraved on the Cup. The engraving was simply \"Montreal 1894\", omitting the MAAA of the 1893 engraving. When the MHC secretary asked the MAAA if the club's annual report was needed for the MAAA annual report, the MAAA board said it was not, as it was understood that the Club did not want to be connected in any way with the Association. The MAAA board attempted to effect a compromise whereby the club would become a \"department\" of the Association but this was defeated. The Club instead decided to become an \"affiliate\" of the MAAA on its own terms. The MAAA refused the application to affiliate the club, as all members of the club were already MAAA members.\nStanley Cup engraving.\n1893 Montreal Hockey Club\nStanley Cup Centennial.\nThe 100th anniversary of the Stanley Cup was celebrated during the 1992–93 NHL season. Each player wore a patch on their jersey throughout the season, depicted an unnamed player wearing a jersey with the NHL shield and hosting the Stanley Cup. The 1993 Stanley Cup Finals logo included the words \"Stanley Cup Centennial\"."

Evershed also played a first class game in 1898 as did Alfred Charlesworth who otherwise only played in the 1888 season. WA Hindley and JH Straw played their one-game each for Derbyshire in 1888 while William Hodges a schoolboy from Cheltenham College and William Pedley a former Sussex player each played two games in the season."

        "text": "The 2010 Commonwealth Games venues were all located in the host city of Delhi.\nCompetition venues.\nEvents took place at twelve competition venues, and twenty venues were set aside as training venues. A total of five venues were newly constructed for the Games and these were the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, the Siri Fort Sports Complex, the Thyagaraj Sports Complex, the Yamuna Sports Complex and Delhi University Stadium. The largest venue was the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, which had a capacity of 60,000 during the Games. The stadium was the main venue of the Games, hosting both the opening and the closing ceremonies. On the other hand, the CRPF Shooting Range located in Kadarpur had the smallest seating capacity, at 345.\nCommonwealth Games Village.\nThe Commonwealth Games Village provided accommodation and training for athletes of the Games, and was open from 23 September to 18 October 2010. It was located along the east bank of the Yamuna river, in proximity to competition and training venues as well as city landmarks, and was spread over an area of . Comprising five main zones—the Residential Zone, the International Zone, the Training Area, the Main Dining and the Operational Zone—the Games Village, which was a non-smoking zone, was universally accessible particularly to accommodate para-sport athletes. Two transport systems, provided free of charge, served athletes and team officials in the Games Village. The Internal Village Shuttle provided internal movement within the Games Village, operating 24 hours daily. Bus services linked the Games Village to competition and training venues, the airport, and the city centre, Connaught Place.\nThe Residential Zone specifically accommodated athletes and team officials, with 1,168 apartments in 34 residential towers. Each apartment had two to five bedrooms, giving 4,008 bedrooms in total; each bedroom accommodated two residents which differed from the traditional practice of providing athletes with a bedroom each. The entire zone itself was divided into four zones, styled after four unique folk art styles found in India as identified by a colour and an image: warli (red), gond (blue), madhubani (green) and sanjhi (purple). Nine Resident Centres, each serving hundreds of residents, were spaced across the residential towers, and they provided key services and facilities as well as entertainment. The Residential Zone also housed offices and services centres for the Commonwealth Games Associations, a polyclinic, religious services and casual dining facilities.\nThe International Zone served as the hub of the Games Village, offering retail and entertainment services as well as a rendezvous location for visitors and Games participants. Key facilities such as a bank, post office and general store were hosted there, alongside retail shops and entertainment facilities including a cinema and an Internet café. Live craft demonstrations, band performances and cultural programmes were also held at the Village. The Training Area, a zonal area by itself with an area of , provided training facilities entirely within the Games Village, in what has been described as a first in the history of the Commonwealth Games. There were facilities for four sports, including a track and field, wrestling and weightlifting training halls and an Olympic-size pool. A fully equipped gymnasium and fitness centre, steam and sauna facilities, physiotherapy rooms, as well as a leisure pool complemented the sport-specific facilities.\nThe Games Village was said to have adopted green features, in line with the 'Green Games' principle of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and it showcased and practiced sustainable development principles and practices. An in-house waste water treatment and reuse facility, organic waste treatment facilities, and solar powered energy were among the environmentally friendly practices adopted by the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters (OC CWG Delhi 2010). At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk. The World Anti-Doping Agency set up an anti-doping education hub in collaboration with the organisers.\nOther venues.\nThere were three main non-competition venues in the Games, besides the Commonwealth Games Village (see above); namely the OC CWG Delhi 2010, the Main Media Centre, and the Games Family Hotel, Hotel Ashok. Situated in the New Delhi Municipal Council building in Connaught Place, the OC CWG Delhi 2010's office was spread over nine floors of the building, with a capacity to accommodate a workforce of over 1,200. The design of the building's interiors was intended to display 21st century India, described as an \"amalgamation of tradition and technological advancement\".\nThe Main Media Centre of the 2010 Commonwealth Games managed media-related activities, and comprised the International Broadcasting Centre and the Main Press Centre. It was set up in close proximity to the Games Village and the main venues at Pragati Maidan. State owned agencies managed both centres, with host broadcaster Prasar Bharti managing the International Broadcasting Centre and the Press Information Bureau managing the Main Press Centre. It was believed that by the time the Games are held, New Delhi would stop analogue broadcast and begin digital broadcast through a conditional access system, for which it is the first city in India to do so.\nOn 4 June 2009, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between OC CWG Delhi 2010 and the India Tourism Development Corporation which officially recognised Hotel Ashok as the Games Family Hotel. Following a major facelift, the hotel served as host to members of Commonwealth Games Associations, the CGF, International Sports Federations, the Indian Olympic Association as well as technical delegates. Also, Hotel Ashok hosted the facilitation offices of OC CWG Delhi 2010 and the CGF, with all events, meetings and conferences held there.\nConcerns over readiness and state of venues.\nNumerous concerns and controversies surfaced before and during the games which received media attention locally and internationally. Delays in the construction of the Games' venues were linked to corruption involving the Organising Committee. A number of infrastructural problems also occurred; these were highlighted by the collapse of a footbridge and the drop ceiling of the weightlifting venue. Less than two weeks before the opening ceremony, Commonwealth Games chief Mike Fennell wrote to the Indian Cabinet secretary, urging action in response to the Games Village being \"seriously compromised.\" He said that although team officials were impressed with the international zone and main dining area, they were shocked by the state of accommodation. The BBC published photographs of the Games Village depicting the poor state of living quarters.\nA number of countries expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with \"The Times of India\" reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted a photograph of a dog defecating on a bed in the Games Village. Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.\nOn the other hand, England's Chef de mission Craig Hunter praised the Games Village, remarking that \"the Commonwealth Games Village here [in Delhi] is better than the Beijing Olympics\". Bhanot claimed that the Games Village was \"world-class\" and \"probably one of the best ever.\" Canadian Secretary of State (Sport) Gary Lunn supported the Games as well, claiming the Canadian delegation would \"not get influenced by the negative publicity\" surrounding the games. He added the difficulties faced by large events are often exaggerated by the media, as Canada had found during the Vancouver Winter Olympics earlier in the year."

        "text": "In baseball, players rarely wear spectacles, but some players played in the major leagues with glasses. For many years, wearing glasses while playing the sport was an embarrassment. Baseball talent scouts routinely rejected spectacled prospects on sight. The stigma had diminished by the early 1960s and by one estimate 20 percent of major league players wore glasses by the end of the 1970s. The development of shatter-resistant lenses in the latter half of the 1940s contributed to their acceptance.\nThe first major-league player to wear spectacles was Will 'Whoop-La' White in 1878–86. Only pitchers dared wear glasses while playing until the early 1920s, when George 'Specs' Toporcer of the St. Louis Cardinals became the first outfielder to sport eyewear. Bespectacled pitchers are less rare as they have less need to field the ball.\nThere are only three players in the Baseball Hall of Fame to have worn eyeglasses during play: Chick Hafey, Reggie Jackson, and Greg Maddux. Because his vision became so variable, Hafey was obliged to rotate among three different pairs of glasses.\nList.\nNon-pitchers.\nOther notable non-pitchers who wore glasses include:\nPitchers.\nPitchers who wore glasses include:\nAnd an umpire:"

        "title": "Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League",
        "text": "The Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League was an athletic conference for men's college basketball, beginning with the 1901–02 season and ending with the 1954–55 season. Its membership ranged from four to eight members; all of these teams now compete in the Ivy League, which began play in 1955–56. The Ivy League's men's basketball league claims the EIBL's history as its own. Through the EIBL, the Ivy League is the oldest basketball conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association; the next oldest, the Big Ten Conference, began play in 1905–06.\nHistory.\nThe league was founded in the 1901–02 season by five schools: Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, Princeton University, and Yale University. The league adopted the double round robin format that has since become standard for college basketball conferences, with each team hosting every other team once and in turn being hosted by all of the others once. Yale won the initial championship with a 5–3 record. \nThe University of Pennsylvania was admitted to the league for the 1903–04 season, after securing temporary playing facilities. The championships during the first few years were evenly divided between Yale, Columbia, and Penn, with the Bulldogs winning three times, and the other two schools winning twice each. The league struggled in its first incarnation; there were many disagreements over the playing rules and eligibility, violent play was common, and on several occasions, teams failed to meet their obligation to play a complete league schedule. Harvard had particular difficulties due to limitations placed upon them by the school's faculty, which forced the squad to drop out of the league in 1904–05 and 1907–08 (and to stop playing altogether between 1908–1909 and 1919–20). These factors led to the collapse of the league, with no competition being held in 1908–09 or 1909–10. \nThe league was reorganized in 1910–11 under the leadership of Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Ralph Morgan, with Columbia, Cornell, Penn, Princeton, and Yale participating. Dartmouth College joined the conference in 1911–12; Yale dropped out in 1912–13, but returned the following year. The conference remained stable at six teams from 1913–14 until 1932–33 (with a one-year suspension in 1918–19 for World War I). Columbia and Cornell were successful early in this period, with the Lions winning two championships, the Big Red one, and both sharing a fourth (the only time a first-place tie was not broken by a playoff game). The late nineteen-teens and early 1920s saw the rise of a great Penn team, winning three straight league championships and defeating the University of Chicago, champions of the Western Conference, in a best-of-three “national championship” series held at the end of the 1919–20 season. This string was interrupted by Princeton, who finished first in 1922 and 1923, and were themselves arguably national champions in 1925. The late 1920s and early 1930s were mostly divided between Columbia and Penn.\nHarvard finally rejoined the league in 1933–34, bringing membership to seven teams. Harvard, Princeton, and Yale all suspended their participation for varying lengths of time during World War II, reducing the league to as few as four members in the 1944–45 season; however, all three quickly resumed their places in the league within two years of the war's end. The late 1930s and early 1940s saw the rise of a long-lived dynasty at Dartmouth, which won seven straight championships (still an EIBL/Ivy record) and made two trips to the finals of the new NCAA national championship tournament. By contrast, the post-war period produced a high degree of parity, with every team except Harvard winning at least once between 1945–46 and 1953–54. \nDuring these years, the movement to officially form the Ivy League was gathering momentum, culminating in the 1954 extension of the institutions' formal agreement to govern football competition to include competition in all sports. As part of this process, Brown University joined the league for its final two seasons, and it was decided that the EIBL would be absorbed into the Ivy League beginning in 1955–56. The league came to an exciting conclusion in 1954–55, with Princeton emerging as the final champion from a three-way playoff with Columbia and Penn."

        "title": "Tennis tour",
        "text": "A tennis tour (or tennis circuit) is tennis played in tournament format at a series of venues – a tour – over during a set period of weeks or months. Professional tour tennis is played globally with one season consisting of one calendar year. Several tournaments are held each week as players win prize money and earn ranking points. A player's ranking determines her or his ability to enter a particular tournament, as tournaments vary in the amount money and points obtainable. Winning a tournament typically requires winning four to six matches in succession, generally a match a day, as play is single-loss elimination.\nCurrent professional tour tennis.\nCurrently professional male tennis players compete in one of three tours, while there are two tours for female pro players. The highest level of tour tennis is the ATP World Tour and the WTA Tour, for men and women respectively. The ATP World Tour is integrated with the second tier ATP Challenger Tour and the third tier ITF Men's Circuit, as a single, unified global ranking system is kept, the ATP rankings. For women, a player's results on both the WTA Tour and ITF Women's Circuit determine her WTA ranking.\nFemale players are free to play in events in either tour, although top-ranked players almost always play just in WTA Tour events. In fact, they are obliged to appear in certain of the most prestigious tournaments and in a certain number of these during the year or face being penalized by the tour. The same is true of male players. For singles tennis, both men and women ranked outside of the world top 40 or so and inside the top 180 or so will compete in both the top and second tier tour events. For male players, those ranked outside of the top 180 will then compete on both the ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Men's Circuit, while most players ranked outside the top 400 or so must compete on the ITF Men's Circuit. (A few players, despite their ranking, have a certain personal stature that allows them to be granted wild cards into tournaments. It may be that they were once ranked higher or have a certain level of fame, either globally or where the tournament is being held.)\nA ranking cut-off is maintained that varies for each tournament - players ranked above the cut-off gain direct entry in that event's main draw while players ranked below it yet above a second cut-off gain entry into a qualifying tournament for the main draw. In singles tennis, such a player typically needs to win two or three qualifying matches to qualify for entry into the main draw. Matches are nearly always contested best two-of-three sets. Tiebreaks are the norm in deciding sets level at six games apiece. A typical tournament in any tier main draw for singles consists of 32 entrants, while the ATP 1000 events feature 58. For doubles, generally 16 teams compete and matches tied at one set each are settled by match tiebreaks. A few tournaments, notably the season-ending championship, feature round-robin play where players play initially in a mini-league instead of in the typical single-loss elimination. Generally in such events however, the final few rounds are still played in the typical knock-out format.\nThe ATP and WTA tours generally hold more than one tournament each week, while the ITF circuits, which oversees several events weekly, hold a few events during the month of December, the top tier tours' off-season.\nGrand slam play.\nGrand slam tournament play is unique in that, for men, matches are best three of five sets, and that both female and male players do not play singles (or doubles) matches in consecutive days, barring inclement weather or other unforeseen scheduling issues. The fields are expanded as one hundred twenty-eight singles players and 64 doubles teams are featured in the main draws.\nPrevious world tennis tours.\nMen's.\nPrior to 1990 professional men's tour tennis consisted of two competing tennis circuits, the Grand Prix tennis tour and World Championship Tennis. This was particularly true during the 1970s, when tour tennis was started in its current format - previous to this, during the 1930s through to the 1960s, touring professional players tended to play exhibition matches instead of tournaments, as they were given appearance money instead of prize money. This changed most significantly with the advent of open tennis, being in 1968. By 1973, computer rankings were established for singles tennis. (Computer rankings for doubles tennis was begun in the early 1980s.)\nBy the 1980s, the Grand Prix tour was the main men's tennis tour, while WCT events were in certain years even part of the Grand Prix circuit. In 1990, all top tier tour events became part of the ATP Tour as the Association of Tennis Professionals took control of professional tour tennis from the ITF's Men's Tennis Council.\nChallenger tournaments were begun in 1978 and initially were separate events that did not comprise a unified tour. At some point the ATP Challenger Series was formed, the precursor to today's ATP Challenger Tour. Futures tennis tournaments were started by the ITF in the late 1990s. Over time these one-week events replaced satellite tournaments, a mini-circuit typically held over a four-week period at one location. By 2007 satellite events were entirely phased out on the ITF Men's Circuit."

        "text": "Robert Keith Wilson (22 November 1935 – 21 September 2020) was an English tennis player. Wilson reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon four times, Forest Hills twice, and Roland Garros once during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was also a prominent Great Britain Davis Cup team member.\nGrand Slam tournaments.\nWilson was a champion junior player, winning the 1951 British Junior Championship at age 15. He was runner-up the following two years as well as doubles champion partnering Billy Knight. While still a junior Wilson won a senior level singles match at Wimbledon in 1952, then he lost to eventual runner-up Jaroslav Drobný in the second round; the following year, he reached the third round, where he lost to eventual quarterfinalist Sven Davidson in five sets.\nWilson first reached a major quarterfinal in 1958, at Wimbledon. Unseeded, he reached the round without dropping a set, setting up a meeting against No. 1 seed Ashley Cooper. The champion Australian took the first two sets handily before Wilson levelled the match at two sets apiece. The deciding set was closely contested with eventual champion Cooper prevailing 7–5. Wilson, seeded No. 4, reached the same stage the following summer but went out without much of a stir to Roy Emerson in straight sets.\n1960 saw Wilson, the No. 8 seed, reach the quarterfinals at the U.S. Nationals in his fourth appearance at Forest Hills. He then met No. 2 seed Rod Laver. Despite hanging close in the opening set, Wilson went down easily in three straight sets. Wilson reached the quarterfinals again at Wimbledon the following summer. He barely survived his first round match versus Argentine Eduardo Soriano, coming back from two sets to one down to prevail, 6–2, 4–6, 5–7, 16–14, 6–3. Two rounds later, Wilson scored perhaps the biggest match victory of his career, dispatching No. 1 seed Neale Fraser 1–6, 6–0, 13–11, 9–7. The following round, however, proved once again to be a roadblock for Wilson as he went out to No. 8 seed Chuck McKinley in four sets.\n1963 proved to be Wilson's best year as he reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and Forest Hills. In Paris, Wilson, as he often did when he went far into tournaments, breezed through the first four rounds, including a round of 16 win over No. 6 seed Bob Hewitt. However, he went out rather easily in the next round, this time to French champion and No. 3 seed Pierre Darmon. A month later, again unseeded, Wilson made it to the quarterfinals, but was easily beaten by the No. 4 seed Chuck McKinley. His success for the year saw him seeded No. 6 at Forest Hills and he reached the quarterfinals. His opponent this time, however, was not a big name, unseeded Frank Froehling. Taking the first two sets, Wilson looked primed to reach his first major semifinal, but he lost the next two sets. Froehling took the deciding set too, however, by a score of 9 games to 7, saving a match point to do so.\nEven when past his prime, Wilson continued to compete at Wimbledon, often in doubles. He took eventual finalist Wilhelm Bungert to 7–9 in the fifth set of their fourth round encounter in 1967 and in 1969 reached the fourth round, for the last time, in both singles and doubles. His final Wimbledon was in 1977, where aged 41 he played in the mixed doubles and lost in the first round; he played just in the doubles draw from 1971 onward. Overall he played in 124 matches at Wimbledon winning 77 and losing 47. In 1975 he played his last tournament at the Northumberland Championships.\nHis other career singles highlights include winning the Palace Hotel Covered Courts Championships six times (1957–60, 1962, 1967), the Cumberland Hard Court Championships six times (1956, 1958, 1960, 1965, 1968–69), the British Covered Court Championships four times (1959, 1962–63, 1965), the German International Covered Court Championships three times (1961–62, 1964), the North of England Championships three times (1953–54, 1956), the French Covered Court Championships two times (1964–65), and the Irish Championships two times (1963–64). Single tournament wins came at the Scottish Championships (1954), the Welsh Championships (1959), the Midland Counties Championships (1960), the Scandinavian Covered Court Championships (1966), Coupe Albert Canet (1965), the Essex Championships (1967).\nDavis Cup.\nBetween 1955 and 1968, Wilson participated in 34 ties for the British Davis Cup team. He compiled a record of 40 wins versus 20 losses and had a better record in doubles (25–8) than singles (16–12). The most successful year was 1963 when the British team won the Europe Zone, defeating Sweden in the final, to reach the Inter-Zonal semifinal against the United States.\nPost-playing career.\nWilson coached locally in his post-tour days. He was still doing so in 2018 at the age of 82.\nPersonal.\nHe was one of many signatories in a letter to \"The Times\" on 17 July 1958 opposing \"the policy of apartheid\" in international sport and defending \"the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games\".\nIn 1964, Wilson published a book titled \"My Side of the Net\". As of 1981, Wilson was a resident of Finchley, north London, where he also lived as a boy."

        "text": "Mark R. Green (December 26, 1967 – October 5, 2004) was an American professional ice hockey player who played 10 seasons in various North American minor leagues. He was chosen in the ninth round by the Winnipeg Jets, 176th overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft.\nCareer.\nHigh school.\nGreen began his career in Watertown minor hockey. By his sophomore year in high school, Green was a top scorer for the Watertown Cyclones. As a sophomore, he led Section 3 in scoring with 86 points. The following year, he led Section 3 with 40 goals and 68 points. He was named to the Empire State Games roster three straight years, and left Watertown High School after three years to attend New Hampton prep school, finishing with 110 career goals and 181 career points for the Cyclones.\nCollege.\nGreen skated four seasons at Clarkson University. He scored 58 goals and 58 assists in 118 games. During his senior season, he finished with 21 goals and 24 assists and helped the Clarkson Golden Knights reach the Frozen Four in 1991. Green played a key role in the game that clinched the Frozen Four berth, scoring on a power-play late for Clarkson's 4–3 victory over Lake Superior State. Green scored the final goal in Walker Arena history in a preliminary round playoff game against Wisconsin.\nProfessional.\nAfter four seasons at Clarkson University, Green started his professional career with the ECHL's Johnstown Chiefs. On February 15, 1992, during his rookie season with the Chiefs, Green was able to hit the 50 goals in 50 games mark. Defenseman Dave MacIntyre sent a pass up to Green, who had been skating at center ice. Ferreira tipped the puck back to Green, which negated what could have been a two-line pass. Green then skated to the left circle and faked Raleigh defenseman Kris Miller before beating goalie Mike Mudd high on the right side. Green would finish the season with 68 goals, breaking the Johnstown record set by Galen Head, who had scored 67 goals as a member of the Johnstown Jets. Green's 117 points also broke the Chiefs' single-season points record, previously held by Tom Sasso, who had scored 101 points during the Chiefs' 1988–89 ECHL season.\nGreen would leave the Chiefs after one season, but would continue his scoring pace with several minor league teams.\nAs a member of the Louisville Icehawks, Green scored 48 goals in 61 games during the 1992–93 ECHL season. Green would leave the ECHL after falling below his normal point per game pace and signed with the Utica Blizzard for the 1994–95 season. He shattered the Utica Blizzard's single season scoring record by scoring 71 goals in 71 games, and won the Colonial Hockey League most valuable player award. The following season, Green scored 51 goals in 60 games for the Blizzard but finished the season with the Daytona Beach Breakers of the upstart Southern Hockey League.\nIn 1996, Green returned to the Colonial Hockey League and skated with the Saginaw Lumber Kings. He scored a career high 80 goals in 72 games with the Lumber Kings. He re-signed with the Lumber Kings for the 1997–98 season and scored 32 goals in 51 games. Green would leave the team in midseason to sign with the Fayetteville Force of the Central Hockey League. Green finished the season scoring 27 goals in 26 games.\nGreen signed with the Macon Whoopee for the 1998–99 season and scored 45 in 30 games. In 1999, Green signed with the Lubbock Cotton Kings of the Western Professional Hockey League. In his only season with the Cotton Kings, scored 48 goals and 104 points in 68 games. Green returned to Macon and skated 10 games with the Whoopee before retiring in 2001.\nMark Green was the prototypical low-minor league sniper, notching 503 goals in 617 games (including playoffs) in the lower levels of pro hockey. But he never played in the NHL, and only managed nine games in the high minors, with no goals and four assists for the Atlanta Knights in 1992-93 and the Adirondack Red Wings two years later."

In Exhibition Tournament, the player can create a singles tournament, customizing parameters such as the length of matches, and choose between four kinds of surfaces (clay, hard, carpet and grass).\nReception.\n\"GamePro\" stated in their review that \"ATP scores a decisive win over EA's recent \"IMG International Tennis Tour\".\" They particularly praised the game's numerous options, solid controls, and adjustable difficulty, though they did criticize that the scaling of the ball \"sometimes distracts you more than it helps you.\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" applauded the game's originality, commenting that \"The usual \"Pong\" feel of previous tennis games is still all here, but the ability to lob a pass, drill a passing shot, cut the ball, and nail 100 mph serves on the chalk, makes this absolutely the best Genesis tennis product to date.\" Additionally complimenting the highly challenging AI and accessible gameplay, he gave it four out of five stars."

Adamson and NU aimed to be recognized as \"contenders.\" UP coach Aboy Castro commented that while general consensus dictates that Ateneo and FEU were locked in the top two spots, \"it will be tough to get into the 3rd and 4th slot.\" Furthermore, Finals will be aired in ABS-CBN Channel 2.\nElimination round.\nMost games were held at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City and the PhilSports Arena in Pasig, with a single gameday played at Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\"/&gt;\nMatch-up results.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's results\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's results\" /&gt;\nFirst round.\nAfter the opening ceremonies hosted by La Salle, their varsity team blew out UP in the opening game, reminiscent of the opening game blow out during the 2007 tournament where State U finished with a 0–14 record. In the second game, UST won over UE, on what was said to be an upset win over last year's runners-up. Adamson won over NU the next day, and what was rated to be an early match-up of the top two teams, FEU won over Ateneo in a tight contest. FEU won their next six games, sweeping the elimination round; Ateneo on the other hand, after winning another tight game against Adamson, finished second after the first round; their own other loss coming from their arch rivals La Salle, in which the Green Archers capitalized on Kirk Long going to the bench in the final minutes after fouling out. The referees of the Adamson-Ateneo game were later suspended for errant calls that cost Adamson the game.\nAdamson came back after their loss against Ateneo and won two straight against UP and UST. After the loss to Adamson, UP head coach Aboy Castro filed for an indefinite leave of absence from the squad; team consultant Boyet Fernandez was then appointed as interim head coach. On UP's next game, UST was saved by Jeric Fortuna's three-point shots to force overtime and defeat UP.\nUE was unable to secure wins against FEU and NU, while the Bulldogs also suffered a loss against the Tamaraws, before winning against UE. They were beaten anew by UST in another close game, while the Tigers themselves lost to the Green Archers and Tamaraws to cap off their first round with a 3–4 record. UP was still unable to win against UE (which won their first game of the season against them) and Ateneo.\nLa Salle ended their first round with two-point loss against Adamson, which made the Falcons within striking distance from FEU and Ateneo in the standings. Ateneo finished the first round with a triumph against last year's Finals nemesis UE in a close game until the Eagles pulled away late in the fourth quarter.\nSecond round.\nThe Tigers opened the second round with another loss, this time against UE; this led to the two teams being tied with 3–5 records. In the next game, Adamson cut FEU's 7-game winning streak with a one-point loss against Adamson. This assured that there will be no \"stepladder\" format during the playoffs. Ateneo extended their three-game winning streak to four games after a blowout win against the Fighting Maroons; UP then had a record of 0–8.\nLa Salle split their season series against NU with a win to move past the .500 barrier. FEU was brought to another close game, this time against UE, but the Tamaraws were able to defeat the Red Warriors via overtime to notch their first second round win. Off from their win against FEU, Adamson needed two overtime periods to win over UST. The loss effectively close the door for a semifinal appearance for the Tigers.\nLa Salle and Ateneo had similar wins against UP and NU, respectively, with La Salle winning by 21 points while Ateneo won by twenty.\nOff from their win against FEU, and a double-overtime win against UST, Adamson was upset by UE, which by then had two wins in nine games. FEU won over UST, which then had lost five consecutive games, to remain first and clinch the first semifinal berth. Adamson then won against UP, their 11th consecutive loss. The Red Warriors, which had to win all of their remaining games to have shot at the Final Four, shocked Ateneo in what could be a start of an improbable playoff run.\nNU won over UP by two points after a controversial non-call by the referees. Fighting Maroon Mark Juruena had earlier been called for five consecutive lane violations with UP trailing by two points with 1.2 seconds left; UP coach Boyet Fernandez instructed Juruena to deliberately cross the lane while NU's Jewel Ponferrada was attempting his free-throw hoping to tempt NU to do the same act and force a double lane violation (subsequently a jump ball at center court, the possession arrow rule is suspended during the last two minutes of a game); the referees did not call the violation and UP coach Fernandez rushed to commissioner Badolato afterward to plead his case. In their rivalry game against Ateneo, La Salle came up short as Ateneo won, 74–57.\nUST extended UP's woes with another close game, and ended their own five-game losing streak. Off from a loss against Ateneo, La Salle had an upset win against FEU. In what was an elimination game for UE if they lose, UE had their two-game winning run snapped by NU, which then eliminated the Red Warriors from contention.\nWith their last 25 games against Ateneo all losing efforts, Adamson had to win against the Eagles in order to have a realistic chance for a twice-to-beat advantage; however, Ateneo held on to the win, but not after Jumbo Escueta was ejected when a patch fell off his shorts, rendering his uniform dissimilar to his teammates. With the win, Ateneo clinched a semifinals berth.\nFEU won against NU, while La Salle outlasted UST to remain in the top two teams in the standings. In a last-ditch attempt to secure at least a playoff for a twice-to-beat advantage, La Salle was beaten by also-ran UE; Adamson also suffered the same fate, losing to NU to clinch FEU and Ateneo the twice-to-win advantages. FEU then won against UP, their thirteenth loss in the season, and Ateneo won over UST to set up a virtual game for the #1 seed.\nUST ended the season with another loss, this time against NU. This placed NU on the .500 mark, and gave UST coach Pido Jarencio his worst finish as a UAAP head coach. In a virtual playoff for the #3 seed, Adamson won by five points to relegate La Salle to the #4 seed. UE ended the season in a two-game winning streak, beating UP. UP finished the season winless, and had their 18th consecutive loss, including games from the previous season. FEU won over Ateneo after Terrence Romeo and RR Garcia scored on a deciding 8–0 run to lead FEU to victory.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nFEU and Ateneo have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\nControversies.\nCommissioner Ato Badolato suspended the three referees who officiated the Ateneo–Adamson first round game for two games on unspecified \"bad calls.\" Ateneo won that game 69–66.\nBadolato also suspended three players for a single game each for incurring their second unsportsmanlike fouls in the season:\nBadolato further suspended two referees of the NU–UP second round game, and Alvin Padilla of UP for hurling invectives at the officials. Padilla received a one-game suspension, while the referees received suspensions for two play-dates for poor performance; referee Glenn Cornelio was previously suspended as being part of the officiating crew of the Ateneo–Adamson second round game. UP placed the result of the game under protest for the referees' judgment call on UP's lane violation and on a non-call on NU's Emmanuel Mbe's supposedly goal-tending of UP's Alvin Padlla's three-point shot.\nAwards.\nThe UAAP awarded the outstanding players of the season prior to Game 2 of the Finals at the Araneta Coliseum.\nBroadcast notes.\nStudio 23 carried all games live, except for the 1st game of the finals where it was aired live by ABS-CBN in its terrestrial television channel for the first time. ABS-CBN would have aired the third game but the Ateneo Blue Eagles already won the finals series during the second game. SkyCable Channel 166 (Balls HD) aired the finals series on high definition live, with Balls SD airing the replays. The Filipino Channel broadcast the series outside the Philippines."

        "text": "For the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, a total of eight sports venues were used. All of the venues used were new or rebuilt. To make use of television coverage for the first time in the Winter Olympics, the cross-country skiing stadium was constructed to allow the best coverage. Five of the venues used for these games would appear in the James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\" twenty-five years later.\nBefore the Olympics.\nCortina has been a tourist resort since the mid-1800s and quickly became internationally known due to frequent visits by European nobility. Following World War I, Cortina emerged as a sports venue. The first World Championship hosted was the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1927. The city would host the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships five years later.\nBobsleigh was first introduced in Cortina in 1905 though the first track long would not be completed until eighteen years later. It made its international debut in 1928 during the International University Winter Games (now part of the Winter Universiade). The track would be rebuilt in 1936 to meet the standards of other tracks in St. Moritz, Switzerland and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. It hosted it first Bobsleigh World Championships (FIBT) in 1937 in the two-man event. The track was renovated again in 1948 after World War II where all of the turns were rebuilt and the track was lengthened to long and 16 turns. World Championships between 1937 and the 1956 Games took place in 1939 (four-man), 1950, and 1954. Cortina was awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics in 1939, but the games were cancelled due to World War II.\nDuring the Olympics.\n\"Lo Stadio della neve\" () was one of the first venues constructed to meet the needs of television station RAI, Italy's national broadcaster. The Stadium was constructed in an oblong area in an east-west direction with the Grand Stands facing south.\nPrior to the construction of \"La pista di Misurna\" (), the International Skating Union (ISU) had expressed concern over the upkeep, but after a test event the year before the 1956 Games, changed their minds. A sports official for the ISU later stated that the track was easier to maintain than that of Davos, Switzerland even though the track was made of natural ice.\nAfter the Olympics.\nWhen Squaw Valley, California in the United States did not construct a bobsleigh track for the 1960 Winter Olympics, the track served as host for the bobsleigh World Championships in 1960. The death of West German bobsledder Toni Pensperger at the FIBT World Championships 1966 during the four-man event forced the track to improve safety standards. Another Bobsleigh World Championships would not take place until 1981. During the 1981 championships, American bobsledder James Morgan was killed during the four-man event. After Morgan's death, and the death of a stuntman during the filming of the James Bond 1981 film \"For Your Eyes Only\", the track length was reduced to and 13 curves. The track would host the Bobsleigh World Championships twice more in 1989 and 1999. Following the death of Cortina native Eugenio Monti in December 2003, the track was renamed in Monti's honor. In June 2007, the track was selected to host the 2011 world championships. The track withdrew their hosting of the 2011 championships in February 2009 due to issues with the city of Cortina over the track itself. The bobsleigh track is current inactive, but can be re-activated when needed.\nThe ski jump was used as a World Cup venue six times between 1979 and 1985. Its last World Cup competition in 1985 was won by Norway's Roger Ruud. The last known competition of any kind at the jump took place in 1990.\nStadio Olympica is open to the general public and also serves as home to SG Cortina's ice hockey team.\nCortina was first used as an alpine skiing World Cup event in 1981. It was an annual stop for women's alpine skiing from the 1992–93 to the 2008–09 seasons.\nBesides the bobsleigh track in \"For Your Eyes Only\", other venues that appear in the movie are the ski jump, Tofane, Apollonino Stadium, and Stadio Olympica.\nThe only venue to be demolished was the temporary Lo Stadio della neve with all other venues still existing or in use."

He played wing and the school magazine noted that \"on his day his tackles were bone- and morale-shattering.\" After leaving school, Hunter moved to Dunedin and joined the Zingari-Richmond club where he came under the influence of renowned coach Eric Watson. He made a couple of appearances for Otago before a workplace accident left him without his left eye. He subsequently made a career as a coach and selector, coaching Otago from 1992 to 1995, the Otago Highlanders in the 1996 Super 12 competition, and retired from coaching the Auckland Blues in 2001. Hunter was named as assistant All Blacks coach in 1996 and 1997 and an All Blacks selector from 1996 to 1999. He died in Dunedin of cancer in 2002 at the age of 52.\nLegacy.\nSince 2002 the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy has been contested annually between The Auckland Blues and The Highlanders. In 2020, the Highlander's coach Aaron Mauger noted the positive qualities that Hunter had demonstrated and co-captain Aaron Smith said that he \"cared for his players...\"[and]\"...trusted you play your game but also was a bit of a character off the field.\" Writing in the Spinoff in 2017, Scotty Stevenson recounted several humorous stories about Hunter outside of rugby, concluding, \"in essence, he was a coach who loved the game and even more so the boys who played it for him. He was the Detective who left his own fingerprints on New Zealand’s national sport.\" Tony Brown said [Hunter] shaped the way he coached and his impact was because he was respected [and] \"a team first man and someone that was super loyal to all his players and all his players loved him for it and performed for him.\""

        "title": "2002 Winter Olympics torch relay",
        "text": "The 2002 Winter Olympics torch relay was a 65-day run, from December 4, 2001, until February 8, 2002, prior to the 2002 Winter Olympics. The runners carried the Olympic Flame throughout the United States – following its lighting in Olympia, Greece, to the opening ceremony of the 2002 games at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah. The 2002 torch relay was also the 50th anniversary of the Winter Olympic torch relay, which was first run during the 1952 Winter Olympics.\nPlanning.\nPreparations for the torch relay began in March 1999, when the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) issued a Request for Proposals from contractors to plan the relay route, including security and marketing plans. In May, the contract was awarded to Além International Management, Inc., a logistics consulting firm which had previously organized the Olympic torch relays in 1996 and 1998, and was then planning the relay for 2000. Planning of the relay itself began in June, with organizers announcing that the scope of the event would be determined by sponsorships, as all organizing costs would be paid by the relay's sponsors.\nIn February 2000, The Coca-Cola Company and Chevrolet signed an agreement with SLOC to become the official relay sponsors, agreeing to pay two-thirds of the $25 million relay cost. The remainder of the cost would be paid for by official relay providers, such as Delta Air Lines, who flew the flame from Greece to the United States, and Union Pacific, whose trains transported the flame through parts of the United States.\nThe route produced by SLOC and Além was announced to the public on December 4, 2000. It would have the torch cover , passing through 46 of the 50 U.S. states, and be carried by 12,012 torchbearers. The torch would pass through 300 communities, stopping twice a day: once for a midday celebration and then in a larger populated city for the night. 120 of the 300 communities would host the special celebrations, which would allow large groups of people to participate in the Olympic spirit. It also allowed each community to show off local talent, its people, and history. Atlanta, New York City, and Salt Lake City were all selected as special signature cities, and they would host large relay celebrations which would be paid for, planned, and controlled by SLOC. Later plans for special commemorations of September 11, 2001, along the relay route in Washington, D.C., and New York City, would be added to the route plan. The torch and all relay marketing would be designed to closely follow the 2002 Olympic theme \"Light the Fire Within\" and the look of the games theme \"Land of Contrast - Fire and Ice\".\nIn February 2001, the nomination process for torchbearers was begun. SLOC had decided on a theme of \"Inspire\" for the Torchbearers, and people were encouraged to nominate those who inspire others. Of the 12,012 torchbearer positions, SLOC, Coca-Cola, and Chevrolet each got to select one-third of the nominees, while a few were reserved for providers and special guests at the Opening Ceremony. SLOC received approximately 50,000 nominations for its 3,500 positions, so applications were separated by ZIP code then sent to a local community judging panel who scored the applications and selected the torchbearers for their area. Coca-Cola and Chevrolet both received more than 120,000 applications for their positions, and both used a random selection process to choose torchbearers.\nSLOC president Mitt Romney was scheduled to release the names of the selected torchbearers in a press conference at New York City's Battery Park on September 12, 2001. The press conference had initially been set for the morning of September 11, but it was postponed by one day to allow Romney to lobby Congress for additional Olympics security funding. The event was canceled entirely due to the September 11 attacks, which destroyed the World Trade Center towers a few blocks away from the park. The announcement of the torchbearers' names was postponed until October 4, when they were unveiled in an event on the steps of the Utah State Capitol.\nRelay elements.\nTorch.\nThe 2002 Olympic Torch, engineered and manufactured by Coleman, was modeled after an icicle, with a slight curve to represent speed and fluidity. The Torch measured long, wide at the top, at the bottom, and was designed by Axiom Design of Salt Lake City. It was created with three sections, each with its own meaning and representation.\nThe top section was glass, and the Olympic flame burned within the glass, echoing the 2002 Olympic theme \"Light the Fire Within\". The glass stood for purity, winter, ice, and nature. Also inside the glass was a geometric copper structure which helped hold the flame. Copper is a very important natural element of Utah, and represented fire, warmth, Utah's History, and mirrored the orange/red colors of the theme \"Fire and Ice\". The center section was made of silver and finished to look old and worn, while the bottom section was made of clean, highly polished silver. The center section represented the silver mining heritage of the American West, while the bottom section represented the future and modern technology. The Torchbearer gripped the torch at the junction of both the aged and polished silver, during which their hand represented a bridge from the past to the present. The two silver sections also mirrored the blue/purple colors of the \"Fire and Ice\" theme.\nModes of transportation.\nThe Olympic torch was carried through a variety of modes, including runners, skiers, motor vehicles, aircraft, boats, canoes, and bicycles.\nAircraft.\nDelta Air Lines, one of the relay providers, was responsible for carrying the flame across the Atlantic Ocean from Athens, Greece, to the United States. A Boeing 777, known as the \"Soaring Spirit\", decorated in Olympic-themed livery carried the Olympic flame in a ceremonial lantern from Greece to Atlanta, Georgia, during an 11-hour flight.\nRailroad car.\nUnion Pacific, another of the relay providers, used a specially designed railroad car to carry the flame across various areas of the United States (mainly rural and desert areas). Coined the \"Cauldron Car\", it was part of Union Pacific's \"Olympic Train\", which included two diesel locomotives (UP Numbers: 2001 &amp; 2002), 13 passenger cars, and 3 service cars with the cauldron car serving as the caboose. The entire train was painted in Olympic livery, using Salt Lake's \"Look of the Games\" style, known as \"Land of Contrast - Fire and Ice\". The cauldron car contained a 2 million-BTU burner, to keep the flame burning, was originally used during the torch relay for the 1996 Summer Olympics, and was simply redesigned and repainted for the 2002 games. The Olympic train carried the flame on four separate occasions during the 2002 torch relay, for a total of more than through 11 states. Following the games the cauldron car was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum at Union Station, where it is currently on display. In anticipation of the torch relay Overland Models (model railroading) created an H0 scale model of the Olympic Train, which included the two locomotives and several of the passenger cars.\nThe Heber Valley Historic Railroad also played a role in the torch relay. Its historic steam locomotives were joined by another from the Nevada Northern Railway Museum, and together they were known as the \"Olympic Steam Team\". During the games all three locomotives would pull their own eight-car train loaded with spectators to the Soldier Hollow Olympic venue. The day prior to the Opening Ceremony of the games, all three locomotives were combined into one triple-headed train, and used to transport the Olympic flame from Soldier Hollow to Heber City, Utah, as part of the torch relay.\nRoute.\nOn November 19, 2001, the first 2002 Olympic torch was lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece. Greek actress Thalia Prokopiou played the role of high priestess and lit the torch using a flame kept in a clay urn. Usually the torch is lit using a parabolic mirror and the sun's rays, but for the third games in a row, cloudy conditions prevented that from happening during the ceremony. The weekend prior to the lighting ceremony, the flame held in the clay urn had been lit using the parabolic mirror and the sun's rays in case of this situation. Following the ceremony, a two-day Greek torch relay carried the flame to the Panathenian stadium in Athens, Greece, where it burned in a cauldron for two weeks.\nOn December 3, 2001, a Greek skier, Thanassis Tsailas, lit a 2002 Olympic torch from a flame in the cauldron, which in turn was used to light a ceremonial lantern. This lantern was then flown aboard the \"Soaring Spirit\" to Atlanta, Georgia, where it arrived on the morning of December 4. The lantern was unloaded and Bonnie Blair used its flame to light a temporary cauldron to be used at the celebration in Atlanta. During this celebration, Muhammad Ali lit a 2002 Olympic torch from the flame in the temporary cauldron, which he then passed to Olympians Peggy Fleming and Bob Paul, who began the 2002 Winter Olympics torch relay.\nSome elements of the torch relay route were altered or canceled in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Special commemorations were held when the torch passed through Washington, D.C. and New York City, and several survivors, family members of victims, and first responders were given the opportunity to carry the torch. Additionally, the torch was planned to be carried by seaplane from Orlando to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but this was canceled at the last minute because the seaplane operator was concerned about terrorism."

        "text": "The 2017 Rugby League World Cup was the fifteenth staging of the Rugby League World Cup tournament and took place in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea between 27 October and 2 December 2017. The tournament featured the national teams of 14 Rugby League International Federation member countries who qualified through either standing in the previous tournament or a series of qualification play-off matches. In the final, defending champions Australia, playing in their 14th consecutive final, defeated England at Brisbane's Lang Park.\nHost selection.\nAt the 2010 Rugby League International Federation executive meeting, the New Zealand Rugby League made an early submission to co-host the 2017 tournament with Australia. The Rugby League World Cup was last held in Australia in 2008.\nTwo formal bids were subsequently received by the RLIF before a November 2012 deadline; the co-host bid from Australia and New Zealand and a bid from South Africa. On 19 February 2014, it was announced that the joint bid from Australia and New Zealand had won hosting rights.\nMichael Brown, the CEO of several big name Australian sporting franchises and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, was originally appointed CEO of the World Cup in 2015, but resigned less than a year later due to 'workload' and 'homesickness'. He was replaced by Andrew Hill.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nIt was announced on 3 August 2014 that 7 of the 8 quarter-finalists from the last World Cup would qualify automatically for the 2017 tournament; hosts Australia and New Zealand, plus England, Fiji, France, Samoa and Scotland. The USA, who were also 2013 quarter-finalists, were denied automatic qualification after a long-running internal governance dispute saw their RLIF membership temporarily suspended in 2014; later, once the matter was resolved, they were accepted into the qualification process. Papua New Guinea were initially set to be involved in the qualifying competition but were later granted automatic qualification, due to becoming co-hosts of the tournament. In addition to the eight automatic qualifiers, the remaining six spots will come from four different qualification zones; three from Europe, one from Asia/Pacific, one from Americas and one from Middle East/Africa.\nTonga were the first team to qualify from the qualification stage after winning the Asian-Pacific play-off. Lebanon were the second team to qualify from the qualification stage, after winning the Middle East-African play-off. The USA were the third team to qualify, winning the Americas qualification group.\nDraw.\nThe draw was undertaken at the launch of the event in Auckland on 19 July 2016 and involved the same four group format as the 2013 tournament.\nThe first two groups are made up of four teams whilst the other two groups feature three teams each. The top three teams in the first two groups and the winners of the two smaller groups will qualify for the quarter-finals. Group play will involve a round robin in the larger groups, and a round robin in the smaller groups with an additional inter-group game for each team so all teams will play three group games.\nSquads.\nEach team submitted a squad of twenty-four players for the tournament, the same as the 2013 tournament.\nVenues.\nIt was announced in October 2014 that negotiations were being held for Papua New Guinea to host matches. The Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League presented to the RLIF in September 2015, requesting to host three matches. In October 2015 it was confirmed that Papua New Guinea would host three matches in the group stage.\nMelbourne Rectangular Stadium in Melbourne hosted the opening game between Australia and England included an Aboriginal selection and a New Zealand Mãori side. and while Brisbane Stadium in Brisbane hosted the World Cup final.\nOfficiating.\nThe match officials will be headed by Tony Archer and three coaches: Steve Ganson, Russell Smith and Luke Watts.\nGroup stage.\nThe first two groups are made up of four teams whilst the other two groups feature three teams each. The top three teams in the Group A and B, and the winners of Group C and D will qualify for the quarter-finals. Group play will involve a round robin in the larger groups, and a round robin in the smaller groups with an additional inter-group game for each team so all teams will play three group games.\nKnockout stage.\nThree teams from each of Groups A and B and one team from each of Groups C and D advanced to the quarter-finals. All quarter-finalists automatically qualified for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup. The quarter-final fixture were finalised at the conclusion of the pool stages, to ensure that Australia played in Darwin on 17 November and New Zealand in Wellington on 18 November.\nCriticism and controversy.\nThe lack of games in New South Wales, the heartland of rugby league in Australia, drew some criticism. Only one of the 13 confirmed tournament venues was in New South Wales (Sydney Football Stadium) and it is only hosting two group-stage fixtures, both featuring Lebanon. This was due to the refusal of the New South Wales Government to bid for hosting rights. Despite the so-called 'Sydney Cup snub', the RLWC organisers backed their decision and the venues they were using.\nIn the buildup to the Samoa vs. Tonga game in Hamilton, controversy occurred after fans from both countries were caught having brawls in South Auckland. At least 6 people were arrested from the brawls resulting in a massive security increase for the game. Both teams, celebrities, and police urged fans to calm down. Following the results of the controversial incident, a Tongan Advisory Council member lashed out at organisers, saying that this tournament is poorly organised compared to the 2011 Rugby Union World Cup, mentioning that Rugby Union World Cup organisers engaged with community groups 18 months beforehand, whereas this tournament was \"scrambled around\".\nAfter Scotland's 68-point thrashing to New Zealand in Christchurch, captain Danny Brough, Sam Brooks, and Jonathan Walker were sent home for violating code of conduct after being all deemed too 'intoxicated' for their team's flight to Cairns for Scotland's next game against Samoa. Italian players James Tedesco and Shannon Wakeman were under investigation by the World Cup integrity unit for a brawl at a Cairns nightclub.\nThere was criticism on how Samoa and Lebanon qualified for the Quarter-Finals of the World Cup, while Ireland missed out. Samoa played in Pool B where three sides qualify for the finals and only one misses out. Samoa lost to both New Zealand and Tonga, and drew with Scotland. Lebanon was in Pool A which had the same format as Pool B. Lebanon lost to both Australia and England and beat France. Ireland played in Pool C where there are only three teams and the winner is the only team that goes to the finals. Ireland beat both Italy and Wales and only just lost to Papua New Guinea and didn't qualify for the finals. Irish captain Liam Finn, said \"I don't know if it's unfair, it probably makes sense, but to me: try and explain that to someone who's not rugby league,\" , \"That's how we judge it. I tell someone 'we didn't go through, we won two games; someone got through by drawing one,\" and \"That's where we should be focused: how do we attract new fans when that's how you're explaining the game to them?\" in the press conference after his team's victory over Wales.\nBroadcasting.\nSeven Network was the Australian and worldwide host broadcaster, winning the rights for the event in July 2016, beating the likes of Foxtel and Optus."

        "title": "Around the world cycling record",
        "text": "The Guinness World Record (GWR) for fastest circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle is awarded for completing a continuous journey around the globe by bicycle and other means, consisting of a minimum 29,000 km (18,000 miles) in total distance cycled.\nGuinness does not distinguish between supported and unsupported attempts. Most cyclists choose to do the challenge supported, especially through the Australian outback. GWR rules state that the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be 18,000 miles (29,000 km), and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length. The clock does not stop for any waiting time for transit flights or ferries or for the duration of the transit (see full rules below).\nThe principles for unsupported rides are:\nGuinness rules.\nThe rules state \"the journey should be continuous and in one direction (East to West or West to East), that the minimum distance ridden should be , and that the total distance travelled by the bicycle and rider should exceed an Equator's length, i.e. .\" They also state that: \"Any considerable distance travelled opposite to the direction of the attempt must be discounted from any calculations of the overall distance travelled,\" and that the route \"must be ridden through two approximate antipodal points.\"\nAlan Bate writes:\nThe record criteria requires the rider to cover 28,970 kilometers by bike, in an East to West or West to East direction, wavering no more than 5 degrees off course. The total journey distance must be a minimum of 40,075 kilometers, to include all transit by flight or sea. The ride must start and finish in the same place and must pass at least two antipodal points (these are two points that line up through the earth's centre). When the rider reaches a transit point to connect with a flight or boat to the next continent or country start point, the clock stops with regard to the actual riding time *(no longer the case any more since the rules have changed in relation to transit time, which is NOW included in the total time). As most of the earth's surface is water, this is unavoidable and fair as it applies to all athletes attempting the record. Once customs is cleared at the next destination, the clock immediately starts again. The same bicycle must be used throughout the attempt, although repairs and replacement parts and bikes are allowed for mechanical failure. Satellite tracking is highly recommended by Guinness World Records and a daily log, signatures of dignitaries and photographs at strategic points must be collated as evidence.\nThe requirement to pass at least two antipodal points causes some problems in route planning. For example, among popular countries for around-the-world cyclists, the antipodes of Australia is spread out over the Atlantic Ocean, that of North America over the Indian Ocean, that of Africa over mid Pacific Ocean, and that of Europe and most of Asia over the South Pacific Ocean, without any land mass there. Those land areas would not give any opportunities for an antipodal pair while cycling. Some possible pairs are China/Argentina, Malaysia/Peru, and Spain/New Zealand (Madrid and Wellington fall within the ±5-degree difference permitted by Guinness).\nThe length requirement also requires consideration. To cycle Lisbon–Vladivostok (13900 km), Perth–Brisbane (4300 km) and Los Angeles–St. John's (7200 km) with air travel between legs gives 25,400 km. So some detours are needed (such as Invercargill–Auckland, New Zealand, 1800 km, for the sake of the antipodes requirement).\nHistory.\nNick Sanders.\nNick Sanders completed a notable ride in 1984, riding around the Northern Hemisphere in 138 days, although this ride did not meet the requirements to be recognised as a GWR record.\nJay Aldous &amp; Matt DeWaal.\nFrom 2 April to 16 July 1984 Jay Aldous and Matt DeWaal rode 22,997 km/14,290 miles in 106 days, riding a greater distance in a shorter time than Nick Sanders in 1981. Aldous and DeWaal started and ended in Salt Lake City, US, and traveled in an easterly direction passing through 15 different countries. \nAndrew Slodkowski.\nIn December 1993, Andrew Slodkowski () rode \"Around the World in 80 days on a bicycle\". He started and ended in London UK, and traveled in an easterly direction passing through 14 different countries.\nSteve Strange.\nSteve Strange, an Englishman, achieved Guinness's \"Fastest True Circumnavigation of the Globe by Bicycle\": 276 days. On 13 February 2005, he completed the first record attempt under the new Guinness rules, achieving a world record of 276 days and 19 hours.\nPhil White.\nIn April 2005, Phil White completed a record attempt in an estimated 299 days. His time did not beat the one set two months earlier by Steve Strange.\nMark Beaumont (2008).\nOn 14 February 2008, Mark Beaumont completed a circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 194 days and 17 hours.\nJames Bowthorpe.\nIn September 2009 James Bowthorpe completed an eastward circumnavigation, starting and ending in London, in 176 days. This was not ratified by Guinness World Records.\nJulian Sayarer.\nIn December 2009 Julian Sayarer, a London-based cycle courier, completed a circumnavigation, starting at Rouen and going through Europe, Russia, Kazakhstan and China as far as Shanghai; Bangkok to Singapore; the length of New Zealand; Vancouver to the east coast of the US; and finally from Lisbon back to Rouen. The time was first described as 165 days, and ratified by Guinness at 169 days. Sayarer's blog about the ride is at This Is Not for Charity.\nVin Cox.\nOn 1 August 2010, Vin Cox completed an unsupported circumnavigation of the globe, which was certified by Guinness as the new world record with a time of 163 days, 6 hours, 58 minutes.\nAlan Bate.\nOn 4 August 2010, Alan Bate completed the circumnavigation in 106 days 10 hours and 33 minutes, which was ratified by Guinness World Records in January 2012.\nMike Hall.\nOn 4 June 2012, Mike Hall completed his circumnavigation (from Greenwich, eastwards to Greenwich) in 91 days 18 hours. His ride was totally unsupported. After the ride, Guinness World Records changed the rules to include total travel time. Under the new rules Hall recorded a time of 107 days 2 hours 30 minutes, which was not ratified by Guinness World Records.\nJuliana Buhring.\nOn 21 December 2012, Juliana Buhring, of British–German nationality (though born in Greece), arrived back in Naples to complete a circumnavigation in 152 days including total travel time, becoming the first woman to attempt and to complete a circumnavigation of the world by bicycle using a route that complies with the requirements of Guinness World Records. This was an unsupported ride.\nThomas Großerichter.\nOn 31 December 2012, Thomas Großerichter, from Germany, completed a supported circumnavigation in 105 days 1 hour and 44 minutes. This was not certified by Guinness World Records.\nLee Fancourt.\nOn 13 June 2014, Lee Fancourt completed a circumnavigation in 103 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes. \nThis was not ratified by Guinness World Records. Fancourt's record attempt was disqualified after failing to return to the point in India where he took a taxi in order to help out his support crew.\nPaola Gianotti.\nPaola Gianotti started and finished at Ivrea, Turin, Italy, from 8 March to 30 November 2014: 144 days. This was a supported ride. During her voyage, on 16 May 2014, Gianotti was injured in a road accident which resulted in a fractured vertebra. Although the Guinness World Record rules state that the clock does not stop, Gianotti's time was frozen for four months till she recovered and resumed her attempt on 18 September 2014. This was ratified at the time by Guinness as being the world record, but much debated at the time.\nAndrew Nicholson.\nFormer speedskater Andrew Nicholson (New Zealand) completed an unsupported circumnavigation 29,179 km in 123 days, 1 hour and 6 minutes. The ride, which was unsupported, was recognized by Guinness. Nicholson started and ended his journey at Auckland International Airport, New Zealand, between 12 August and 13 December 2015.\nMark Beaumont (2017).\nOn 18 September 2017, Mark Beaumont arrived in Paris having completed a supported circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 78 days 14 hours, and 40 minutes. This beat his previous unsupported attempt by 115 days and beat the previous world record by 44 days and 10 hours and should be regarded as the record. This attempt was verified by Guinness World Records as he finished in Paris. The BBC reported, \"During the trip, Mark was also awarded the Guinness World Records title for the most miles cycled in a month, from Paris to Perth, Australia, verified at 7,031 miles (11,315km)\". Beaumont had significant support on his ride from a \"base camp\" team who stayed in Scotland, and \"on the road\" teams who followed in camper vans which provided him a comfortable place to rest when off the bike. The support team covered duties ranging from preparing his meals and ensuring optimum nutrition, optimising his route to avoid ratification pitfalls, providing massages to help alleviate the discomfort of spending long hours in the same position, and psychological support during low points.\nVedangi Kulkarni (2018).\nBetween July and December 2018, Vedangi Kulkarni, a native of Pune studying at Bournemouth University, attempted to become the fastest woman to circumnavigate the world on bicycle. Although she did not succeed in this, she was the \"fastest Asian\" to do so. Her journey started at Perth, crossing to Brisbane, crossing New Zealand, from Vancouver to Halifax, across Iceland, from Portugal to Finland, across Russia, 4,000 km across India to Kolkata; and from there flying to Perth for a 15 km ride to the starting point. The ride took 159 days as far as Kolkata and its distance exceeded 29,000 km. Kulkarni was 19 when she started and 20 when she finished the ride. She became \"the fourth fastest woman to cycle round the world, as well as the youngest\".\nJenny Graham (2018).\nOn 18 October 2018 Jenny Graham arrived in Berlin having completed an unsupported circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 124 Days, 10 hours and 50 minutes. This has now been verified by Guinness World Records and as such is the new woman's record.\nCaroline Soubayroux &amp; David Ferguson (2021-2022).\nIn September 2021, Caroline Soubayroux and David Ferguson, a married couple based in London, left from The Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel to try and set a new Guinness world record circumnavigation for a married couple on two bikes. Both of them took a six-month sabbatical leave from their full-time career in Investment Banking and Orthopaedic Surgery to allow for the trip. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic meant they suffered delays and rode a majority of their circumnavigation in the Southern Hemisphere, crossing South America and Africa. Their attempt was fully unsupported with the exception of the Australian leg where a camping van driven by Ferguson's father provided camp for the night. New Zealand being closed at the time of their travel, their antipodal point was Honolulu in Hawaii, the archipelago being the antipode of Botswana. Soubayroux and Ferguson successfully completed their circumnavigation on 16 April 2022. The record was checked and validated by Guinness on 28 April 2023.\nTandem record.\nJohn Whybrow and George Agate.\nOn 25 March 2017, John Whybrow and George Agate (known as 'The Tandem Men'), set the first tandem bicycle circumnavigation record. Starting and finishing in Canterbury, UK, the pair completed their attempt in 290 days, 7 hours and 36 minutes aboard an Orbit Tandem. This was an unsupported ride.\nLloyd Collier and Louis Snellgrove.\nOn 16 May 2019, Lloyd Collier and Louis Snellgrove cycled 29,140 km and crossed the finishing line at the Adelaide Oval, Australia in 281 days to achieve the Guinness World Record. They rode through 24 countries and 5 continents. Both emergency doctors, they raised money for Spinal Research and The Brain foundation. Their ride was westwards and unsupported.\nCat Dixon and Raz Marsden.\nOn the 29th June 2019, Cat Dixon and Raz Marsden (both UK) set out on their tandem bike to embark on what would become a record-breaking adventure around the world; completing their journey in 263 days, 8 hours and 7 minutes. \nCat, 54, and Raz, 55, set out from Oxford last year, covering 18,263 miles on a route that took them through 25 different countries and five continents. The record-breaking route: Starting in Oxford, UK, then onto France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, United States, Mexico, Morocco, Spain, Gibraltar and then finally back through France to the UK, where they completed their journey. \"We have highlights from every country that we visited and would definitely return to see many- although maybe at a slower pace,\" the pair said.\nSteLa Tandem: Steven Massey and Laura Massey-Pugh.\nOn 5 June 2022, Laura Massey-Pugh and husband Steven (Stevie) Massey (both Derby, UK) started from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, their aim to set a new mixed circumnavigation record on tandem bicycle and hold the fastest tandem record by completing the trip in 180 days. They returned on 1 December 2022 with a time of 179 days 12 hours and 25 minutes, which has been registered by Guinness as a new record. Their trip took them through Czechia, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia before closed land borders to Azerbaijan forced them to travel directly to India. They then travelled to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, before crossing the South of Australia, both Islands of New Zealand and the breath of Canada before returning to Europe via Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Holland and back to Germany. They suffered monsoons and sickness in India, a motorcycle collision in Malaysia and sub -10°C temperatures in Canada but remained resolved to make their 180 day target despite major mechanical issues within the final 24 hours. They say their trip was certainly not a holiday and they would never do it again but are very proud of their achievement as a couple and a team.\nUnicycling.\nWally Watts.\nBetween 1976 and 1978, Walter J. Watts, known as \"Wobbling\" Wally Watts unicycled 12,000 miles around the world. Travelling eastward, he started and ended in New York. Some countries he unicycled in: UK, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, India, Australia, New Zealand, United States.\nEd Pratt.\nFrom March 2015 to July 27, 2018, Ed Pratt unicycled 21,000 miles (33,000 km) for 3 years, 135 days, starting and ending in Somerset, England. He had a specially made pannier that helped him to complete the trip unsupported. The trip was discontinuous in time: he suspended his trip during the winter time due to icy, slippery conditions. This discontinuity lasted longer than 14 days, and was one of the reasons Pratt did not receive the Guinness World Record for Unicycling around the world. When he was no longer able satisfy the conditions for the Guinness record, he made his own rule that on land he would ride his unicycle, or walk, and push it, so that \"apart from the watery bits [he would make] an unbroken unicycle tire track around the entire planet\". He was awarded the award for using the trip to fundraise for the charity School in a Bag, which delivers school equipment to children in need around the world."

Other prominent matches included The Undertaker defeating CM Punk, concluding a storyline revolving around Paul Bearer's death and The Undertaker's WrestleMania undefeated streak. In the penultimate match, Triple H defeated Brock Lesnar in a No Holds Barred match; had Triple H lost, he would have retired. Also, Alberto Del Rio retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Jack Swagger in the title's final defense at WrestleMania, as it was unified with the WWE Championship in . Due to that, this was the last WrestleMania to feature two world titles until WrestleMania 33 in 2017.\nWrestleMania 29 was a commercial success; it drew 80,676 fans, which became the third highest attended event in the history of WWE after WrestleMania 32 and WrestleMania III, and it became the highest grossing live event in WWE history, grossing $72 million.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Announced on February 16, 2012, WrestleMania 29, promoted as WrestleMania NY/NJ, was scheduled to be held on April 7, 2013, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nThis was the fifth WrestleMania in the New York metropolitan area; WrestleMania I, X, and XX were held at Madison Square Garden, and a portion of WrestleMania 2 was held at Nassau Coliseum. It was the third WrestleMania held in the state of New Jersey after WrestleMania IV and V, both of which were held at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. The event was the fifth WrestleMania to be held outdoors (after IX, XXIV, XXVI, and XXVIII), but the first to be held outdoors in a cold-weather city. To combat this, WWE added a heater that was hanging above the ring. Additionally, six electric furnaces were plumbed underneath the ring and vented into the ring posts to supply warm air.\nTickets went on sale on November 10, 2012, during which WWE set a first-day sales record of 52,029 tickets, beating the WrestleMania X8 record of 51,620 tickets. Partly due to increased ticket prices, WWE also set a first-day revenue record of more than $10 million, which topped WrestleMania XXVIII's previous record of $6.3 million. For the first time, WrestleMania was streamed on mobile devices via the WWE app and on Xbox Live.\nWrestleMania's set included replicas of several New York City landmarks, including the Brooklyn Bridge and Empire State Building on top of the entrance ramp, the Statue of Liberty on a podium above the ring. There are three official theme songs for the event, \"Coming Home\" by Diddy – Dirty Money feat. Skylar Grey, \"Bones\" by Young Guns and \"Letters from the Sky\" by Civil Twilight.\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs performed a medley of tracks during the event, and Living Colour performed \"Cult of Personality\" as CM Punk made his way to the ring.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at WrestleMania 29 featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, WWE. Storylines between the characters played out on WWE's primary television programs, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nOn January 27, John Cena won the 2013 Royal Rumble match, making him the fourth multiple Rumble winner, and earning himself either a WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 29. Later that same night, The Rock won the WWE Championship from previous champion CM Punk. The next night on the January 28 edition of \"Raw\", Cena announced he would challenge the reigning WWE Champion, thus challenging The Rock. At the Elimination Chamber event on February 17, Rock successfully defended the championship against Punk. The next night on \"Raw\", Punk challenged Cena for his spot in the main event, and Cena accepted. Cena won the match on February 25, setting up a rematch of his \"Once in a Lifetime\" match from the previous year against Rock. Cena blamed Rock for sending his life into a downward spiral, citing events such as being attacked by Brock Lesnar on the post-WrestleMania Raw, Big Show turning heel and attacking him, being embarrassed by John Laurinaitis at Over the Limit, failing to cash in his Money in the Bank, losing to CM Punk multiple times and losing to Dolph Ziggler at . He told Rock he would gain redemption by beating him at WrestleMania.\nAt Elimination Chamber, World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio successfully retained his championship against Big Show. Jack Swagger, Chris Jericho, and Mark Henry, who all made their return, earned spots in the six-man Elimination Chamber match, along with Daniel Bryan, Kane, and Randy Orton to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. Swagger won the match and challenged Del Rio for the title at WrestleMania. Throughout the weeks, Swagger and his new manager, Zeb Colter, repeatedly stressed about the ignorance of America and allowing illegal immigrants in, and promised that they would bring a new era of \"Jack Swagger's America\". They also repeatedly attacked Del Rio, and Swagger injured Del Rio's ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez's ankle.\nOn the February 25, 2013 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H returned, brawling with a returning Brock Lesnar (who was last seen at SummerSlam in 2012), who was about to attack Vince McMahon for the second time, thus reigniting their feud from last year. During the brawl, Lesnar's head was busted open and required 18 stitches. The following week, Triple H set out a challenge to Lesnar at WrestleMania. On the March 11 episode of \"Raw\", after Lesnar attacked Triple H's former D-Generation X members, The New Age Outlaws, Lesnar's manager, Paul Heyman, stated that Lesnar accepted Triple H's challenge, but only if Heyman could add the stipulations, to be revealed after Triple H signed the contract. Triple H signed the contract, therefore, he accepted the conditions, then Heyman revealed that the bout would be No Holds Barred and that if Triple H lost the match, he must retire from WWE. On the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania, Shawn Michaels announced that he would be in Triple H's corner for the match to support him.\nOn the March 4 episode of \"Raw\", which celebrated \"Old School Raw\", The Undertaker made his return (his first appearance since WWE Raw 1000) by opening up the show, signaling any challenger to face him and try to end his undefeated WrestleMania streak at the event. CM Punk, Randy Orton, Big Show, and Sheamus all declared they wanted to face The Undertaker, prompting \"Raw\"'s Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero to set a Fatal Four-Way match among the four later that night. CM Punk won the match by pinning Orton, earning him the match against The Undertaker. The following night, Undertaker and Kane's former manager Paul Bearer died of respiratory problems. The next week on \"Raw\", Punk interrupted Paul Bearer's tribute segment to boast that he would break Undertaker's streak, which prompted Kane to attack Punk, although Punk escaped. Later that night, Kane defeated Punk in a No Disqualification Match, before Undertaker came to the stage to perform his signature taunt with Kane to honor Bearer. Punk interrupted once again by hitting Kane with The Undertaker's urn, which prompted Undertaker to chase him away, and Punk escaped with the urn. On the March 18 episode of \"Raw\", The Undertaker came to the ring to tell Punk he had one chance to return Undertaker's property but was interrupted by Punk on the TitanTron, who further boasted about being the one to \"snap the streak\" while nonchalantly tossing the urn in the air. Disguised as a druid, Punk further assaulted Undertaker on \"Raw\" and constantly beat him with the urn. Punk then boldly opened the urn and emptied its ashes over a fallen Undertaker, thus igniting their feud.\nOn the March 15 episode of \"SmackDown\", The Shield (Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose) challenged Randy Orton and Sheamus to a six-man tag team match at WrestleMania 29. Orton and Sheamus accepted, then recruited Ryback as their partner. Later that night, The Shield interfered in Ryback's match with Mark Henry and delivered a triple powerbomb to Ryback before he was given three World's Strongest Slams by Henry. The following Monday on \"Raw\", Vickie Guerrero pulled Ryback from the six-man tag team match and put him in a singles match with Henry. After winning a match on the March 18 episode of \"Raw\", Sheamus and Orton were about to be assaulted by The Shield, but then Big Show – who had also been brutalized by The Shield – came out to aid Orton and Sheamus, causing The Shield to retreat, and on \"SmackDown\" that week, Sheamus, Orton, and Big Show were teamed together by Booker T to test their teamwork in a six-man tag match against 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal), in which they were victorious. Following the match, The Shield came to the ring to confront the victors before retreating once again.\nOn the March 18 episode of \"Raw\", Dolph Ziggler defeated Kofi Kingston, with outside help from his bodyguard Big E Langston. This caused WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane), who both had been attacked by Langston during past matches with Ziggler, to challenge them at WrestleMania. Ziggler's girlfriend, AJ Lee, said they would accept the match only if Team Hell No put their Tag Team Championship on the line, to which they agreed.\nA minor rivalry between Chris Jericho and Fandango (the former Johnny Curtis from NXT) developed prior to Wrestlemania. Fandango made numerous appearances, but he never competed in matches due to announcers and wrestlers repeatedly mispronouncing his name or did not say it with the right kind of \"feel\" he liked. The feud with Jericho began on the March 22 episode of \"SmackDown\" when Jericho made fun of Fandango's name. This caused Fandango to interfere with Jericho's match and attack him following the match. Fandango attacked Jericho once more on the March 25 episode of \"Raw\" after Jericho's match. This caused Jericho to ask Vickie Guerrero to set up a match between himself and Fandango at WrestleMania. According to Jericho, the original plan was Jericho vs. Ryback, but Vince McMahon changed his rival.\nThe other rivalry that had escalated was between The Miz and Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett. Miz and Barrett had been trading jabs back and forth about which of them was the better actor, as Miz had starred in \"\", and Barrett had a minor role in the film \"Dead Man Down\". After defending his title in a triple threat match against Miz and Chris Jericho on the March 18 episode of \"Raw\", Barrett continued the feud with Miz after he shoved him on \"Main Event\" on March 20, which caused Miz to retaliate. On the March 25 episode of \"Raw\", Miz defeated Barrett in a non-title match via submission, thus earning him a championship match against Barrett. The match took place on the WrestleMania 29 Pre-Show.\nCanceled match.\nThe Bella Twins and Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow) were scheduled to participate in an eight-person tag team match against Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay and Tensai) and The Funkadactyls (Naomi and Cameron) at WrestleMania, but the match was canceled due to time restraints&lt;ref name=\"Raw4/1/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and instead took place the following night on \"Raw\", where Tons of Funk and The Funkadactyls emerged victorious.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the WrestleMania XXIX Pre-Show, a panel consisting of Jim Ross, Kofi Kingston, Dusty Rhodes and Scott Stanford discussed the event's matches. Later in the pre-show, Snooki spoke backstage to The Miz and Wade Barrett. Their Intercontinental Championship match, commentated by Matt Striker and Josh Mathews, went back and forth between both wrestlers. Miz went for the Skull Crushing Finale, but Barrett moved and went for the Bull Hammer. Miz moved and knocked Barrett to the ground and locked in the Figure-Four Leglock, shades of Ric Flair, and Barrett submitted, giving Miz his second Intercontinental championship in his career.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with The Shield (Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose) facing Sheamus, Big Show, and Randy Orton in a 6-Man Tag Team Match. Sheamus and Roman Reigns started the match. Big Show ripped off Ambrose's vest and chopped his chest. Sheamus also removed Seth Rollins's vest. When The Shield went for their trademark Triple Powerbomb on Sheamus, Big Show speared all of them at the same time. When Sheamus tried to tag Big Show, Orton tagged himself in, frustrating Big Show. Rollins came off the top rope but Orton performed an RKO on Rollins. Reigns performed a spear on Orton and Ambrose pinned him. After the match, Big Show knocked out both Sheamus and Orton.\nNext, Mark Henry faced Ryback. Henry knocked Ryback out of the ring a few times. Ryback knocked Henry down with a Meat Hook Clothesline, then tried to perform a Shell Shock on Henry, who grabbed the ropes. Henry crashed down on Ryback, driving his face into the mat and knocking him out, then pinned him. Afterward, Ryback gave Henry a spinebuster and a Shell Shock.\nAfter that, Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston. Ziggler mocked Daniel Bryan by kissing his on-screen girlfriend, AJ Lee, as Bryan did before his loss at WrestleMania XXVIII. Bryan flew out of the ring onto Ziggler, while Kane and Big E fought inside. Later, as Big E distracted Kane, Ziggler executed the Zig-Zag on Kane for a nearfall. While AJ distracted the referee, Big E threw Ziggler his Money In The Bank briefcase. Ziggler tried to strike Kane with it, but he ducked and Kane performed a choke slam. In the end, Kane tagged in Bryan and Bryan executed a top-rope headbutt for the pin on Ziggler to retain the titles.\nIn the fourth match, Fandango, in his in-ring debut, faced Chris Jericho, who began by punishing Fandango. Jericho delivered a Codebreaker early in the match. Fandango executed a roundhouse kick, then a diving leg drop on Jericho for a near-fall. When he went for another, Jericho moved, then went for a Lionsault, but Fandango got his knees up. As Jericho attempted for the Walls of Jericho, Fandango quickly rolled him up for the pin.\nNext, Alberto Del Rio defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Jack Swagger (accompanied by Zeb Colter). Del Rio Irish whipped Swagger into the barricade. Swagger later executed the Swagger Bomb, but Del Rio kicked out. Swagger then executed his gut-wrench powerbomb but Del Rio kicked out again. Swagger worked Del Rio's leg, then tried the Patriot Lock a few times, but Del Rio didn't submit. In the end, Del Rio locked in the Cross Armbreaker and Swagger submitted, and Del Rio retained the title.\nMain event matches.\nIn the first match of the triple main event, The Undertaker defended his 20–0 WrestleMania winning streak against CM Punk (accompanied by Paul Heyman). Punk first tried to intimidate Undertaker, finally slapping him. Undertaker retaliated with a chokeslam attempt, but Punk countered it with a roundhouse kick to the back of the head. Undertaker delivered a big boot to Punk and threw him outside, where they brawled. Undertaker cleared the Spanish broadcasting table and executed a guillotine leg drop on the ring apron on Punk. Back in the ring, Undertaker attempted his signature move, Old School, but was pulled off the rope. Punk then stole the move and used it against Undertaker. Undertaker attempted a big boot to the corner but was caught on the top rope when Punk moved. Punk executed a flying double axe handle and then attempted to steal Old School again, but was thrown from the ring. Undertaker then ran the ropes in an attempt to perform his signature over-the-top-rope suicide dive but Paul Heyman stepped onto the apron in his way. Undertaker then attempted to chokeslam Heyman but Punk saved his manager by connecting with a springboard clothesline on Undertaker for a near-fall. Punk then performed a running high knee in the corner and short-arm clothesline followed by a diving elbow drop on Undertaker for another count of two. He then attempted a Go To Sleep, but Undertaker countered with a chokeslam, for a two-count, then Snake Eyes. Punk retaliated with a heel kick and threw Undertaker to the outside. Undertaker tried to Last Ride Punk through the table he'd cleared, but Punk countered and kicked him the back of the head. He laid Undertaker on the table, climbed the turnbuckle, and executed another diving elbow drop onto the broadcasting table. The referee began counting Undertaker out as Punk made it back into the ring, but Undertaker made it back into the ring with one second to spare. As Punk attempted to pick him up from the mat, Undertaker suddenly attempted the Hell's Gate. Punk countered into a bridging pin for another near-fall. He then secured the Anaconda Vice, but Undertaker powered through to his feet and tried another chokeslam, which Punk reversed into the Go To Sleep but Undertaker immediately rebounded off the ropes and nailed Punk with the Tombstone for a dramatic near-fall. Back on their feet, the two traded blows, and the referee was knocked down in the chaos. Punk hit the high knee again, but Undertaker took advantage of the position by attempting Last Ride. While Punk was on Undertaker's shoulders, Heyman handed him the urn, which he struck on the back of Undertaker's head. Punk then mocked Undertaker's traditional pinning style for another two-count. Punk and Undertaker proceeded to trade near-finishers, with the Undertaker's Tombstone finally winning out, securing his victory and improving his streak to 21 wins. He reclaimed the urn and walked backstage, pausing on the ramp to raise his fist.\nIn the second main event match, Triple H faced Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) in a No Holds Barred match with Triple H's career at stake. Prior to the match, Triple H suffered 2nd degree freeze burns due to a pyrotechnic malfunction, causing dry ice to be sprayed on to his chest and torso during his entrance. Triple H and Lesnar quickly spilled to the floor of MetLife Stadium, pummeling each other with anything and everything within arm's reach. Triple H sent Lesnar crashing into the ringside barricade and then Lesnar drove Triple H's sternum into the broadcasting table in return. After a big brawl, both in and outside of the ring, which included Shawn Michaels getting an F5 from Lesnar and Paul Heyman receiving Sweet Chin Music, Triple H stole Brock Lesnar's submission move, the Kimura lock, and locked it on Lesnar for an extended amount of time. In the end, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Lesnar onto the steel steps and got him down for the three-count securing his career and keeping his in-ring skills intact.\nIn the main event, The Rock defended the WWE Championship against John Cena. After the bell rang, Cena struck first before The Rock seized control of the match and halted Cena's momentum by sending him scrambling outside the ring to regroup within the bout's opening moments. The match went on while The Rock had control by striking Cena with blows and punches. Cena then locked The Rock into a Crossface, but The Rock countered into a pin for a 2-count. Cena then locked The Rock in an STF, but The Rock powered out. The Rock then executed a Rock Bottom on Cena but only for a 2-count. Cena then performed an AA on The Rock, but only got a 2-count. The Rock soon delivered a People's Elbow on Cena for another 2-count. Cena soon went for a second AA, but The Rock countered into a second Rock Bottom for a 2-count yet again. A frustrated Rock nearly fell into the same trap Cena did the year before when he taunted Cena with Cena's own \"You Can't See Me\" taunt before going for a second People's Elbow, however, Cena caught The Rock and delivered a second AA for another near-fall. The Rock soon went for a third Rock Bottom, but Cena countered and executed a Rock Bottom instead for a near fall. Cena then tried to sucker The Rock into a third AA by faking a People's Elbow attempt, the same mistake that cost Cena the match the last year. However, when Cena went for the third AA, The Rock countered into a third Rock Bottom for another 2-count. Afterward, both John Cena and The Rock went for an AA and a Rock Bottom respectively. This continued until The Rock delivered a DDT on Cena. But instead of pinning Cena, Rock instead went for a fourth Rock Bottom and Cena countered with a third AA to win the match and the title. After the match, Rock and Cena shook hands and hugged each other and Rock praised Cena as the new WWE Champion, and raised his hand on the top of the stage.\nReception.\nWrestleMania 29 received generally positive reactions. Matt Kodner of The A.V. Club gave the show a letter grade of B. He generally criticized the event as \"too much of the same, with nary a sense of fun to the matches.\" He claimed the main event between John Cena and The Rock was \"all too similar, and the match never popped.\" He named The Undertaker vs. CM Punk \"match of the night\". \"Though it came nearly an hour before the night was over, their match was the clear climax, and the only true triumph of \"WrestleMania XXIX\"\" he said. Kodner claimed P. Diddy gave a \"spectacularly phoned-in performance,\" claiming, \"I'll take last year's funky army of dancing mommas as led by Brodus Clay over Diddy any day of the week.\" He praised the announcers for doing a \"fine job\" but said John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield stole the show during the advertisement for Power Slammers action figures. He also praised Fandango's understated entrance but criticized the technical problems on the live stream that caused many watching through WWE.com to miss the opening match.\nCanadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section gave the entire event a rating of 8 out of 10. The six-man tag team match received a 7 out of 10, the World Heavyweight Championship match received a 5 out of 10 and the CM Punk-Undertaker match received a perfect score of 10 out of 10. The Triple H-Brock Lesnar match received a 7 out of 10, the same rating as the main event.\nWrestleMania XXIX garnered 1,048,000 PPV buys, 205,000 fewer than the previous year's event. The event set a new record for the highest grossing live event in WWE history, grossing $72 million.\nWrestleMania 29 set a new world record of 80,676 fans at MetLife Stadium and was the then second-highest attended wrestling event in history after WrestleMania III.\nAftermath.\nThe Rock suffered legitimate torn muscles and tendons around his pelvis from the match. He later returned at WrestleMania XXX, albeit in a non-wrestling appearance.\nOn the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania, Cena put his championship on the line against anyone. Mark Henry answered the challenge, which turned into a number-one-contender match. Cena won by count-out, and was then assaulted by Henry. Ryback then came to seemingly save Cena – making Henry retreat and helping Cena to his feet – but then attacked Cena. Prior to the April 22 episode of \"Raw\", Cena was scheduled to defend the WWE Championship against Ryback. On the May 6 episode of \"Raw\", the match was made a Last Man Standing match. The match ended in a no-contest after Ryback rammed Cena through the entrance stage. The night after, Ryback came out with an ambulance and challenged Cena at Payback in an ambulance match. Cena accepted and made the match a three stages of hell match, in which Cena won.\nWade Barrett invoked his rematch clause on \"Raw\" and defeated The Miz, reclaiming the Intercontinental Championship for his third reign. In reality, this was done so The Miz could take time off to film the movie \"Christmas Bounty\". Barrett was set to put the title on the line at Payback in a triple threat match against The Miz and Fandango. Fandango was injured and replaced by Paul Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. Axel won the championship.\nAlberto Del Rio and Jack Swagger had one more match to end their feud, but it turned into a 2-on-1 handicap match with Del Rio facing Swagger and Zeb Colter. Del Rio won but had his leg injured by Swagger. Dolph Ziggler took this opportunity to cash in his Money in the Bank contract, and – despite Del Rio putting up a fight – pinned Del Rio to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. Ziggler was soon concussed and put out of action. He still held the title, and Del Rio and Swagger feuded over the number one contendership. At Extreme Rules, Del Rio won an \"I Quit\" match for the number one contendership. Del Rio defeated Ziggler at Payback to win the World Heavyweight Championship for a second time, ending Ziggler's reign at 69 days. During the match a double turn occurred, Del Rio turned heel attacking Ziggler's head taking advantage of his concussion, and Ziggler turned face showing a \"never-say-die\" attitude.\nBrock Lesnar returned to \"Raw\" on April 15, to challenge Triple H (who had suffered second degree burns to his torso and arms during his WrestleMania ring entrance when the stage sprayed dry ice on him) to a steel cage match at Extreme Rules. A week later, Triple H came out to the surprise of Paul Heyman to accept the challenge and gave Heyman a Pedigree. Lesnar won the rematch at Extreme Rules. Paul Heyman came out the next night to reveal his newest client Curtis Axel. Triple H interrupted and issued a challenge to Axel before slapping him. Later that night, Triple H suffered a concussion during the match. The match ended as a no contest, but the victory went to Axel. Triple H returned on the June 3 edition of \"Raw\", attempting to fight Axel, but was forbidden by his wife Stephanie McMahon, and his father-in-law Vince McMahon. He returned to the ring on June 10 edition of \"Raw\" to fight Axel. During the match, Vince took the ring bell and stopped the match after Triple H tried to restart it.\nOn the April 15 episode of \"Raw\", CM Punk came out to talk about his match with The Undertaker and his historic WWE championship reign. Punk gave Heyman the microphone, hugged him and walked out of the arena. He returned by defeating Chris Jericho at Payback. Punk then dropped Heyman as his manager, causing Heyman to turn on Punk and Punk becoming a face again.\nThe Undertaker came out the next night on \"Raw\" to pay tribute to Paul Bearer but was interrupted by The Shield who tried to attack him until Team Hell No made the save. The next week Undertaker wrestled his last match on \"Raw\" teaming up with Team Hell No in a losing effort against The Shield by pinfall from Dean Ambrose on Daniel Bryan. The same week Undertaker wrestled his last match on \"SmackDown\" in a winning effort against Ambrose of The Shield by submission with Hell's Gate. Afterwards Undertaker made some defense against them but Roman Reigns speared him through the barricade in the timekeeper's area and with his teammates triple powerbombed him through the broadcasting table. After \"SmackDown\" went off the air Undertaker was saved by DX (Triple H, Billy Gunn and Road Dogg). CM Punk would become the final victim of Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak as at WrestleMania XXX would lose at the hands of Brock Lesnar, ending the streak at 21-1.\nChris Jericho continued his feud with Fandango, with each man attacking the other after matches. Jericho defeated Fandango in a rematch at Extreme Rules.\nWrestleMania 29 was the last WrestleMania to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, as the title was unified with the WWE Championship at December's event, with the latter being renamed to WWE World Heavyweight Championship. It would in turn be the final WrestleMania to feature two world championships until WrestleMania 33 in 2017."

He played for the Syracuse Athletic Club during the round-robin tournament later called the 1902 World Series of Football, held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Prior to playing for Syracuse, Mason played professionally for the Watertown Red &amp; Black. He was reportedly recruited to join Syracuse before the 1902 series by Colgate University football coach, Frank \"Buck\" O'Neill. Mason scored a touchdown in each of the series two games, as Syracuse defeated the Knickerbocker Athletic Club, and the Orange Athletic Club, to claim the 1902 series title.\nToday Mason's uniform from that series is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. It was donated to the Hall by a man claiming to be his son around 1983. The man offered to donate the uniform, but only if Joe Horrigan, the Hall's Vice President of Communications and Exhibits, would pick it up himself from his home in Buffalo, New York."

        "title": "St. Joseph's Catholic Church (Bowling Green, Kentucky)",
        "text": "The St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is a historic church at 434 Church Street. It was built in 1859 and added to the National Register in 1975. It has also been known as St. Joseph's Church. It was added to the National Register because it possesses exceptional interest for its history and architecture.\nHistorical Sites.\nHalf the population visits historical sites because of an emotional connection to a past experience. The other half of the population visits historical sites because they would like to experience history in a personal way by being \"taken back\" to that time period.\nFoundations (1853–1888).\nIn 1853, Louisville Bishop John Martin Spalding requested the twenty-two-year-old seminarian, Father Joseph DeVries, to continue the evergrowing mission. Father DeVries and eight other missionaries were ordained in 1855. The Church began its foundations in 1859 when a small frame building was constructed for a school of boys but was used for Mass on Sundays. The Church's deed stated that the Church is designated for the Catholic people of Warren County. Francis Leopold Kister, a master German architect began designing and building the structure. The walls were not yet plastered when the first Easter Sunday Mass was held. The Church was completed in 1889 because the Civil War created interruption to the building process. The bell for the church weighing six-hundred pounds, was cast in Troy, New York. Once brought to Kentucky, it was blessed in 1863 and is still in use today. The steeple is 142 feet tall and the highest in the city at the time.\nEarly days (1889-1930).\nThe second pastor, Father Thomas J. Hayes on August 10, 1889, because of the unexpected death of Father DeVries. Father DeVries was buried under the main altar of the Church marked by a marble slab on the sanctuary walls. On Easter Sunday in 1902, the church was badly damaged in a fire. This led to the leaders of the church deciding to decorate the interior of the church with fresco paintings, originally done by Charles and Guido Leber (artists from Louisville, Kentucky). In 1903, additions to the exterior of the church were added. A small stoop was added to the rectory and the church's walls were extended to the street. In August 1912, it was decided that St. Joseph's Catholic Church should open a school. The School and the convent for the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth was built right next to the church. The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth staffed the school for 55 years and the school remained open until 1965 with eight grades.\nWorld War I.\nDuring the years of World War I, St. Joseph's Parish was active in contributing aid by selling handmade paper carnations made by the disabled veterans for about 25 cents each (red if the mother was living and white if the mother was deceased) In 1923, the steeple was destroyed by a cyclone and replaced by the current pyramidal structure which rises to about . This same year the church's street was paved.\nThe Depression, World War II, and the 50s (1930-1965).\nIn 1931, columns were added floor to ceiling and finished with faux marble. However, it was not until 1937 that the interior was redecorated. Father Raymond G. Hill conducted a drive to fund the Leber family to redecorate the interior of the church after 34 years. At this same time, new Gothic lanterns replaced existing chandelier light fixtures. \"Pew rent\" was also introduced that year which was a way for parishioners to pay for their families to have a special seat for Sunday Mass. In the late 50s, Knights of Columbus celebrated their 50th anniversary at St. Josephs Catholic Church. Later that next year in 1959, St. Joseph's parish celebrated its 100th anniversary with a banquet at a local restaurant called Old Fort Restaurant. The Centennial Mass took place on December 7, 1959. However, before the mass Fr. Bowling had the same artist come back and redecorate the interior 21 years after the 1937 redecoration. The majority of the original frescos were painted out because of finances and a new rubber tile floor was installed.\nLate Twentieth Century (1966-1990).\nReverend Charles P. Bowling retired in March 1971 after 24 years of service. Father Richard Powers stepped in to fill the position with a music and welcome party. When the parish sent in information to the National Register of Historic Places, it was noted that the original organ from 1898 was still intact. The Grand Organ has 18 ranked pipes and incases of white quarter oak."

        "text": "\"New York\" (the New Yorks or the New York Philadelphians) was a professional football team formed by promoter Tom O'Rouke for the World Series of Football in 1902. The event was held in New York City at Madison Square Garden. It featured five football teams from New York and New Jersey: the Syracuse Athletic Club, Orange Athletic Club, Knickerbocker Athletic Club, Warslow Athletic Club and \"New York\". The \"New York\" team was designed and heavily favored to win the tournament. However, they were defeated in the opening game by Syracuse.\nOrigins.\nThe \"New York\" team comprised ex-players from the recently defunct Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Athletics of the first National Football League – eight Phillies and four Athletics. It included Charlie Gelbert, Blondy Wallace, Walter E. Bachman and Ben Roller. However, the team also featured some recognizable players from New York such as Curly Davidson. By putting together a team of all-stars calling them the \"New York\" team, O'Rourke expected to give his New York audience the pleasure of watching the \"home team\" win.\nThe tournament was scheduled to last three nights starting on December 29 and ending on New Year's Eve. O'Rourke scheduled his tournament by considering the expected strengths of the teams. On opening night, he scheduled the \"New York\" team against Syracuse. By defeating Syracuse, the \"New York\" team, O'Rouke hoped, would then defeat the team that would probably bring the fewest fans into the Garden. Then on the second night, the Knickerbockers and Warlow would play to determine which team would be beaten by the \"New York\" team in the series' third game. O'Rourke anticipated this game as having the best attendance of the tourney. Finally in the fourth game, by holding out the Orange Athletic Club until the end, he predicted a New York versus New Jersey match-up in which New Jersey would lose a close game to one of the three New York teams.\nOpening game vs. Syracuse.\nO'Rourke didn't realize how seriously the Syracuse team took the tournament. The team was put together by Frank \"Buck\" O'Neill who conducted daily practices in preparation for the series. Syracuse defeated \"New York\" in what has been called the first indoor pro football game. The final score of the game was recorded as 6-0, but in reality it was 5-0, since touchdowns only counted for five points in 1902 and Syracuses' Glenn Scobey \"Pop\" Warner missed the extra point. Warner later suffered a head injury and was replaced by \"New York's\" Blondy Wallace. Syracuse would go on to win the Series with a 36-0 win over the Orange Athletic Club."

He was born in Nacogdoches, Texas and attended Nacogdoches High School.\nHargis enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin in the early 1940s and played college basketball there. In both 1942–43 and 1946–47, he led the Longhorns to the NCAA Final Four, where they would lose to eventual national champion Wyoming and win the third-place game over CCNY, respectively. In each of those two seasons he was named All-Southwest Conference and, in 1947, a consensus Second Team All-American. After the 1943 season, Hargis enlisted in the United States military and fought in World War II for three years, then returned to Austin to finish college in 1947.\nAfter school, Hargis played for the Anderson Packers for three seasons, then split time between the Fort Wayne Pistons and Tri-Cities Blackhawks during his fourth and final year as a professional. For the first two years, the Packers were a member of the NBL. In 1949–50, however, they merged into the NBA. As a rookie in 1947–48, Hargis was second on the team in scoring (642 points; 10.9 ppg). In his second season, he scored 444 points (7.8 ppg), and then in his final season with the Packers, Hargis averaged 10.7 ppg while scoring 643 points. In addition to moderate personal success, the Packers also won the NBL championship in Hargis' second year on the team.\nIn April 1948, Hargis played in final edition of the World Professional Basketball Tournament with the Packers (team finished in third place) and earned \"second all-tournament team\" honour after scoring 34 points in 3 games.\nIn April 1950, Hargis was drafted by the Fort Wayne Pistons from the Anderson Packers in a dispersal draft because their franchise had folded. After only playing in a handful of games for the Pistons, he was sold in December 1950 to the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. Hargis finished out the rest of the season with them but was not re-signed to any team and never played professionally again.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

It was their tenth successive season in the top flight of English football and although they finished 14th, lower than on any of the previous nine occasions, they finished high enough to maintain their top flight membership.\nSeason summary.\nWith the Premiership's lowest crowds and transfer budget, Wimbledon had begun most of their top division seasons since promotion in 1986 as pre-season relegation favourites, but the \"Crazy Gang\" spirit kept Wimbledon going once again, although their 14th-place finish was their lowest since joining the top flight 10 seasons earlier.\nDean Holdsworth and Efan Ekoku were once again a formidable strikerforce, while Vinnie Jones was as combative as ever and Oyvind Leonhardsen's performances attracted attention from several bigger clubs. Manager Joe Kinnear managed to hold on to all his key assets, as well as adding a few more, over the close season as he grew ever more determined to defy the odds once again. \nIt was the last season at Wimbledon for long-serving goalkeeper Hans Segers, who lost his place early in the season to Paul Heald and was transferred to Wolves soon afterwards. Within a few months however, Kinnear had decided on Neil Sullivan as his regular goalkeeper. \nThe season saw Wimbledon play in European competition for the first (and the only) time in their history, in the Intertoto Cup. However, as Selhurst Park was unavailable the club were forced to play the matches at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion's Goldstone Ground. The lack of home support affected Wimbledon's performances, and they finished fourth in their group of five after a 4–0 home defeat to Turkish club Bursaspor, a 1–1 draw at Slovakian side Košice, a 0–0 draw with Israelis Beitar Jerusalem at home and a 3–0 away defeat at Belgian team Charleroi.\nKit.\nCore became Wimbledon's kit manufacturers for the season.

        "text": "The 1936 Winter Olympics, officially known by the International Olympic Committee as the IV Olympic Winter Games, were a multi-sport event held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, from February 6 through February 16, 1936. A total of 646 athletes representing 28 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated at the Games in 17 events across 8 disciplines.\nThe Olympic programme was changed from that of the 1932 Lake Placid Olympics, with the addition of alpine skiing for both men and women. Two demonstration sports were held—eisschiessen and military patrol. Later added to the regular programme as biathlon, military patrol made its third appearance as a demonstration sport in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen Games. Both men and women participated at these Games, with the women's alpine skiing event being the first medal event women contested at the Winter Olympics outside of figure skating. Two figure skating events for women—ladies' singles and pairs—had been part of the programme since the first Winter Olympics.\nA total of 95 athletes won medals at the Games. Norway topped the medal count with fifteen medals, seven of which were gold. Sweden had the second most number of medals with seven, but had one less gold medal than host nation Germany, who had three golds and six overall medals. Austria, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States won medals in more than one event. Athletes from 11 of the 28 participating NOCs won at least a bronze medal; athletes from eight countries won at least one gold. Great Britain's unexpected win in ice hockey remains their only Olympic gold medal in the sport to date.\nSonja Henie of Norway won her third straight gold medal in the ladies' singles figure skating event, her last Olympic medal as she turned professional shortly after the Games. Karl Schäfer of Austria also successfully defended his men's singles figure skating title from Lake Placid. Sweden swept the medals in the cross-country 50 km, as did Norway in the Nordic combined. Norway's Ivar Ballangrud was the most successful athlete, winning three golds and a silver in speed skating and taking his career total to seven Olympic medals. Other multiple medal winners were Oddbjørn Hagen of Norway (one gold, two silvers), Ernst Baier of Germany (one gold, one silver), Joseph Beerli of Switzerland (one gold, one silver), Erik August Larsson of Sweden (one gold, one bronze), Birger Wasenius of Finland (two silvers, one bronze), Olaf Hoffsbakken of Norway (two silvers), Fritz Feierabend of Switzerland (two silvers) and Sverre Brodahl of Norway (one silver, one bronze).\nMultiple medallists.\nAthletes who won multiple medals are listed below."

The Garnet Chargers are a member of ECAC Hockey. They play at the Frank L. Messa Rink at Achilles Center in Schenectady, New York. The Garnet Chargers (known as the Dutchmen at the time) won the 2014 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament by defeating the Minnesota Golden Gophers 7–4.\nProgram history.\nThe hockey team was founded in 1904 making it the 7th oldest college program playing in NCAA Division I and provides the school with a long and colorful history in the sport. Men at Union have played hockey in four distinct periods: club hockey from 1904–1911, varsity hockey from 1919–1949 (from 1943–1948 there was a hiatus from play due to WW II), NCAA Division III hockey from 1975–1990 and NCAA Division I hockey from 1991–present.\nEarly history 1904–1911.\nUnion's first game, played on February 3, 1904, was a victory over the Union Classical Institute. Three other games were played that inaugural season including a 1–4 loss to rival Rensselaer. Lacking a rink of its own during that inaugural season, all games were played on the opponent's home ice. The first attempt at creating an on-campus outdoor rink was made by students in 1905 when a plow and scaper was hired to form a level area with earthen banks near what is now Memorial Chapel. The club team's record in known games during those early years was 6–7–1. No collegiate games were played in the 1910 or 1911 seasons because Union's players couldn't afford the costs of travel and opponent game guarantee fees. The club team subsequently disbanded bringing a close to the earliest era of hockey at Union.\nDivision I era 1991–present.\nIn 2023, the college changed the school's athletic nickname from \"Dutchmen\" and \"Dutchwomen\" to \"Garnet Chargers\" as part of a branding update. Garnet has been the school's official color for 150 years, and the name \"chargers\" is a reference to \"Schenectady’s legacy as a leader in electrical technologies.\"\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nChampionships.\nECAC Hockey Tournament championships (Whitelaw Cup).\nRunners-up in 2010\nECAC Hockey Regular season Championships (Cleary Cup).\n† Shared with Harvard\nAwards &amp; honors.\nHobey Baker Memorial Award\nSpencer Penrose Award - AHCA Coach of the Year\nUSCHO Coach of the Year\nCollege Hockey News Coach of the Year\nNCAA Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player\nNCAA Frozen Four All-Tournament Team\nNCAA East Regional Most Outstanding Player\nTim Taylor Award - ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year\nECAC Hockey Player of the Year\nKen Dryden Award - ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Year\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Forward\nECAC Hockey Student Athlete of the Year\nECAC Hockey Tournament Most Outstanding Player\nECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team\nAHCA First Team All-Americans (DI) - East\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans (DI) - East\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans (DIII) - East\nAcademic All-American Second Team\nAcademic All-American Third Team\nUnion College Athletics Hall of Fame\nHead coaches.\nAll-time coaching records.\n&lt;br&gt;\nGarnet Chargers in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "The Quinnipiac Bobcats men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Quinnipiac University. The Bobcats are a member of ECAC Hockey. They play at the M&amp;T Bank Arena in Hamden, Connecticut. \nHistory.\nQuinnipiac College began sponsoring men's ice hockey as a varsity sport for the 1975–76 season. The program began as an independent team before joining ECAC 3 the following year. The program remained with the third-tier conference for over 20 years despite being a Division II school for much of that time. The Braves left ECAC 3 in 1997 and spent a year as a D-II independent before moving up to Division I as part of the university's transition to the top level. Quinnipiac was a founding member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference ice hockey division, joining the conference as an affiliate member. The Braves won the MAAC Regular season Championship in their first season in the league. The trend continued as Quinnipiac won the title the follow two seasons. In 2002 The Braves won the team's first playoff series, winning the MAAC Playoff Championship with a 6–4 win over Mercyhurst. With the win, Quinnipiac received an automatic bid to the 2002 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the first NCAA postseason appearance in program history. Quinnipiac faced off against Cornell in the first round of the East Regional, held in Worcester, Massachusetts. Quinnipiac's run into the NCAA tournament ended early in a 1–6 loss to the Big Red. The game was the first NCAA tournament appearance for the Braves. Quinnipiac finished the 2001–02 season 20–13–5, marking the team's fourth consecutive season with at least 20 wins.\nIn 2003 the MAAC Hockey league split off from the main athletic conference to form Atlantic Hockey. After two years in Atlantic Hockey Quinnipiac left to join the ECAC, replacing Vermont who left the league for Hockey East and changed their name to the Bobcats. QU was chosen over a number of applicants in large part to the university's commitment to build a new multipurpose sports arena to replace the civic-owned Northford Ice Pavilion. The Bobcats moved into the new 3,386-seat TD Bank Sports Center (then known as TD Banknorth Sports Center) in 2007.\nThe 2012–13 season has brought Quinnipiac to national prominence. The program reached a new high becoming the number one team in the country on February 11, 2013 in both the USCHO.com poll and USA Today College Hockey poll. Quinnipiac retained the ranking the following week despite losing their first game as the top ranked team to St. Lawrence University as the 2nd and 3rd ranked teams also fell the same weekend. The Bobcats also won their first ever Cleary Cup presented to the ECAC regular season champion. On March 24, 2013, the Bobcats received the number one overall seed in the 2013 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament. The Bobcats won the East Region with wins over Canisius (4-3) and Union (5-1) to advance to the school's first ever Frozen Four in Pittsburgh, Pa. In the national semifinals, Quinnipiac defeated St. Cloud State (4-1) to advance to the national championship game against archrival Yale. The Bobcats fell 4–0 to Yale to end the 2012-13 as the national runner-up.\nIn the 2013–14 season the Bobcats once again reached the NCAA tournament yet were defeated in the first round by Providence College 4–0. The team finished the season with a 24-10-6 record.\nQuinnipiac once again had a successful 2014–15 season when they won their second ECAC regular season title in 3 years but lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to North Dakota 4–1. The team finished the season with a 23-12-4 record.\nThe 2015–16 season saw Qunnipiac set a school record for wins with 32 along with winning their 3rd ECAC regular season title in 4 years and winning the ECAC tournament championship for the first time. Quinnipiac blew through the East Regional with wins over RIT 4-0 and UMass Lowell 4–1 to capture the regional championship and advance to the Frozen Four in the Tampa for the 2nd time in 4 seasons. In the national semifinals the Bobcats withheld a late charge by Boston College to win 3-2 and advance to the second national championship game in program history. Once again Quinnipiac was denied a national championship this time at the hands of North Dakota in a 5–1 defeat. The team finished the season with a record of 32-4-7.\nOn April 8, 2023, the Bobcats won their first-ever NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament championship, defeating the Minnesota Golden Gophers 3–2, scoring the winning goal just ten seconds into overtime.\nRivals.\nSince moving to the ECAC, Quinnipiac's biggest rival has been the Yale Bulldogs. The rivalry is dubbed the War on Whitney Avenue as the two campuses are separated by a mere 8 miles on Whitney Avenue in Hamden, Connecticut, to New Haven, Connecticut. The rivalry has reached its highest point in 2013 as both the Bobcats and the Bulldogs rank in the top 10 nationally and are 1 and 2 in the ECAC standings. The winner of the final game between the two teams receives the Heroes Hat which honors those who risked their lives during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The two teams met on April 13, 2013 for the fourth time in the 2012–13 season in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to play for the national championship. Quinnipiac won the previous three meetings by a combined score of 13–3, but was upset in the national championship game, 4–0.\nThe Cornell Big Red have also become a rival of Quinnipiac with the teams meeting in five ECAC Hockey Playoff series since the 2007 season having won in 2007 at Lynah Rink and in 2013 and 2016 in Hamden with the latter two coming with Quinnipiac as the ECAC number one seed and seasons in which Quinnipiac reached the Frozen Four. Cornell won series in 2011 and 2018 both at Lynah Rink. Quinnipiac is 3–2 in those series against Cornell with three of the series going the maximum three games. Things on the ice have been heated at times with a lot of physical play and both Rand Pecknold and Cornell head coach Mike Schafer jawing at each other as well.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nTim Taylor Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nMAAC.\nIndividual awards.\nOffensive Player of the Year\nDefensive Player of the Year\nDefensive Rookie of the Year\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-MAAC\nSecond Team All-MAAC\nMAAC All-Rookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRegular season Goaltending Award\nRegular season Scoring Trophy\nCoach of the Year\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nSecond Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nAtlantic Hockey All-Rookie Team\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nECAC Hockey Player of the Year\nECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year\nKen Dryden Award\nECAC Hockey Student-Athlete of the Year\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Forward\nTim Taylor Award\nECAC Hockey Most Outstanding Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nQuinnipiac Bobcats Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Quinnipiac men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Quinnipiac Bobcats Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nBobcats in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "The Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Princeton University. The Tigers are a member of ECAC Hockey. They play at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1999, future NHL player Jeff Halpern scored 22 goals to tie for the most goals in the ECAC and was co-winner of Princeton's Roper Trophy for athletic and academic achievement. In 2010–11, Andrew Calof was ECAC Rookie of the Year.\nHistory.\nPrinceton University had an ice hockey team organized already during the 1894–95 season, when the school still went by the name of College of New Jersey. On March 3, 1895 the university ice hockey team faced a Baltimore aggregation at the North Avenue Ice Palace in Baltimore, Maryland and won by a score of 5–0. The players on the 1895 team were Chester Derr, John Brooks, Howard Colby, James Blair, Frederick Allen, Ralph Hoagland and Art Wheeler.\nFor the 1899–1900 season the Princeton University ice hockey team became a member of the Intercollegiate Hockey League (ICHL) where they played organized league games against other Ivy League school teams such as Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Yale.\nPrinceton's most famous ice hockey player Hobey Baker (1892–1918) played for the school team between 1911 and 1914, before he graduated and went on to play for the New York City based St. Nicholas Hockey Club.\nAs many college programs did, Princeton's ice hockey squad suspended operations for the 1917–18 season due to the United States entering World War I but the icers returned after the armistice was signed. A few years later the Tigers hired their first head coach, Russell O. Ellis, but they would go through several more before they could find someone to lead the program for more than a few years. Despite the tumult behind the bench Princeton was still producing some of the best teams in college hockey, setting a program record of 15 wins that would stand for 76 years.\nIn the midst of the great depression Richard Vaughan came to Princeton and would helm the team for the next quarter-century. Vaughan would keep the Tigers competitive through much of his tenure and his 159 wins remains a program high 60 years after his retirement. Princeton found it difficult to replace Vaughan, going through 5 coaches in 18 years while producing only two winning records in that time. The team's nadir came under Bill Quackenbush who, despite ending up in the Hall of Fame as a player, was the program's worst coach as far as records go. Quackenbush's tenure began well with Princeton making the ECAC tournament for the first time, but the following season the team slid to 16th in the conference and would not win more than 5 games a year for the next 5 seasons. Quackenbush remained with the program even after a 1–22 season but resigned in 1973 with the Tigers an afterthought in ECAC Hockey. Princeton would not play another postseason game until 1985, the year after 7 teams left to form Hockey East, and they would not win a playoff game until 1992 under first-year head coach Don Cahoon.\nDuring Cahoon's time at Princeton the program recovered from decades as a bottom-feeder and in 1995 produced their first winning season in 27 years. Three seasons later the Tigers won their first conference tournament and made the NCAA tournament for the first time. After Cahoon left to head Massachusetts in 2000, he was replaced by long-time assistant Len Quesnelle but after four years the team was back at the bottom of the conference and he was swiftly replaced by Guy Gadowsky.\nIt took Gadowsky a few years to get the Tigers back on their feet but he led the team to its second conference championship in 2008, setting a program high with 21 wins that he bested by 1 the following year. Two years later Gadowsky left and was replaced by Bob Prier but just as had happened with Cahoon, the successor did not last long and after a dismal third season Ron Fogarty was hired as the 17th head coach in program history. As of 2019 Fogarty's best season came in 2018 when he led an underdog Tigers squad to their 3rd conference title.\nStatistical leaders.\nThe team's statistical leaders are as follows.\nCareer Goaltending Leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nBest Defensive Forward\nKen Dryden Award\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nTim Taylor Award\nMost Outstanding Player in tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Princeton alumni who have played on an Olympic team.\nTigers in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "The Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Harvard University. The Crimson are a member of ECAC Hockey. They play at the Bright Hockey Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The Crimson hockey team is one of the oldest college ice hockey teams in the United States, having played their first game on January 19, 1898, in a 0–6 loss to Brown.\nThe Crimson's archrival is the Cornell Big Red. The teams meet at least twice each season for installments of the historic Cornell-Harvard hockey rivalry.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\n The Crimson hockey team was founded in 1898 making the team one of the oldest college ice hockey teams in the United States. The team played on a local pond and played their first recorded intercollegiate game against Brown on January 19, 1898, at Franklin Field in Boston. The rivalry is the oldest continuing college hockey series in the country. The Crimson lost that game 0–6 but the Brown-Harvard rivalry continued and later become US college hockey's oldest rivalry.\nThe two teams played again the following winter; Brown won that game by a score of 2–1. The Crimson would get their first recorded win in program history in 1900 with a 10–1 win over MIT. That same season Harvard beat Brown in back to back games. On February 26, 1900, Harvard played Yale for the first time. The game was held at the St. Nicholas Rink in New York and the 4–5 loss was the Crimson's only loss of the 1899–1900 season.\nIn 1903 Alfred Winsor became the team's first official head coach. The team previously used captains in a player-coach role, including Winsor who served as the Crimson's captain from 1901 to 1902. Under Winsor the team recorded a 22-game winning streak that spanned five and a half seasons and lasted from January 10, 1903, to Jan 19, 1907.\nAfter beginning the program on a pond and playing on various outdoor rinks constructed on campus over the seasons, the university constructed two ice rinks inside Harvard Stadium for the 1904 season and move some old bleachers to the side of the rink. The university also began charging admission for select important games for the first time. The Crimson later moved home games to the Boston Arena, the first indoor ice rink in Boston and one of the oldest in the United States. A few years after moving into the Boston Arena, on March 14, 1913, the Harvard University Athletic Committee voted to make ice hockey a major sport in the university's athletic department. Following the 1917 season Alfred Winsor stepped down as the head coach after compiling a 124–29 record in 15 seasons as Crimson head coach. The following season was suspended because of World War I with the team resuming play in 1919.\n1919–1944.\nFrom 1919 to 1921 the team went back to playing at outdoor rinks after the Boston Arena caught fire in the fall of 1918. The Crimson returned to the arena after it was rebuilt in the fall of 1921. Following three seasons again with no official coach, William H. Claflin became the second coach in program history in 1921 On March 7, 1923, William H. Claflin and captain George Owen '23 substituted entire forward lines instead of individuals, in the first recorded use of a line change. The idea proved successful as Harvard defeated Yale 2–1 in overtime.\nOn March 12, 1930, Harvard and Yale played the final game of a three-game series to end the 1930 season. The two teams split the first two games of the series. The game was called off at midnight due to blue laws despite the teams being tied in the third overtime and a record crowd in excess of 14,000. The resulting tie caused the two rivals to share the 1929–30 intercollegiate title.\nJoseph Stubbs became the fourth head coach in program history starting with the 1927–28 season. He stepped down after the 1937–38 season with a record of 95–43–6 record in 11 seasons. Stubbs led the team to four seasons of double-digit wins, including two back-to-back 11-win seasons in 1930–31 and 1931–32, as well as a 12-win season in 1935–36, and leading the Crimson to a 15–1 record in 1936–37.\nThe Quadrangular League was created for the 1933–34 with Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth, the league is considered the predecessor to the Ivy League. In 1936, the Council of Ivy Group Presidents agreed on the formal formation of the League, however the agreement did not go into effect until the 1955–56 season.\n1945–1960.\nThe program was suspended for two years during World War II but then returned to the ice for an abbreviated 1945–46 season. In 1950 Ralph \"Cooney\" Weiland became head coach, Weiland was a former NHL scoring champion who won Stanley Cups as both a player and a coach with the Boston Bruins. With the hire, Weiland became the first non-alumnus to become head coach of the program.\nWeiland guided Harvard to win the inaugural Beanpot hockey tournament on December 27, 1952, when the team defeated Boston University 7–4. A few seasons later Weiland's Crimson team competed in the 1955 NCAA Ice Hockey Tournament. It was the first Frozen Four appearance by the university. The 1954–55 season was highlighted by William J. \"Billy\" Cleary leading the nation in scoring with 89 points in 21 games, his point total still stands as the Harvard single-season record. Cleary and classmate Chuck Flynn become Harvard's first All-Americans. The team returned to the tournament in 1957 and 1958. All three tournament appearances under Weiland saw the Crimson exit in the semi-final round.\nIn 1956 Harvard moved into the 2,000-seat Donald C. Watson Rink bringing hockey back on campus from the Boston Arena. The rink was located north of Harvard Stadium.\nHarvard became a founding member of the ECAC Hockey League in 1961. That same season, on January 4, 1962, Harvard defeated Northeastern 6–1 for the program's 500th win. In its second season in the ECAC, Harvard won both the league regular season championship and, with a 4–3 overtime win over Boston University, won the league championship.\nAt the conclusion of the 1970–71 season Weiland left the program after 21 years. He compiled a record of 316–172–17, six Ivy League championships, two ECAC championships, and five NCAA appearances. Weiland was named coach of the year by the American Hockey Coaches Association in 1955 and 1971. In 1971 he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and received the Lester Patrick Award for contribution to hockey in the United States in 1972.\n1971–1990.\nBill Cleary, former Crimson All-American, took over coaching duties for the 1971–72 season after serving as an assistant coach under Weiland. On March 7, 1975 – Harvard defeated Cornell 6–4 to win the 23rd game of the season, the first 20-win season in program history. Unfortunately, the Crimson would lose in the finals the next day to Boston University and finish fourth in the NCAA Tournament with defeats to Minnesota and the same BU squad. The team was captained by All-American Randy Roth '75, who the previous year was named the Crimson's first ever ECAC Player of the Year.\nBy the mid-1970s the Donald C. Watson Rink was becoming outdated and the university made plans to construct a new hockey facility. A decision was eventually made to extensively upgrade the facility and in 1978 the walls were removed and the roof was extended before the new arena was installed at a cost exceeding $5-million. During the renovation the Harvard's men's and new women's teams played out of various local rinks in 1978–79. Following the renovation the facility was named after former Harvard hockey player Alec Bright '19. The Bright Hockey Center increased seating by more than 800 people The ice surface was extended by five feet to 204 feet by 87 feet under the direction of coach Cleary.\nCleary lead the Crimson to their third conference tournament championship by beating Providence 4–1 in the ECAC Championship, sending the Crimson to the 1983 NCAA Tournament. Harvard first defeated Michigan State in the two-game quarter-final series by a combined score 9–8. The Crimson advanced to the Frozen Four in Grand Forks, North Dakota and defeated Minnesota 5–3 to send Harvard to the program's first NCAA Championship appearance. The Crimson was defeated in the NCAA final 2–6 by Wisconsin. Despite the loss in the final, Mark Fusco became the school's first Hobey Baker Award winner. Three seasons later, his brother, Scott Fusco became the second player and first ever pair of brothers to win the Award.\nDespite a 2–3 overtime loss to Vermont in the ECAC semifinals, the 1988–89 team received an at-large bid to the 1989 NCAA Tournament, the team's fifth straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Harvard swept Lake Superior State in the two game quarter-final round by a combined score of 9–4. The team advanced to the Frozen Four in St. Paul, Minnesota and defeated Michigan State 6–3 before facing the hometown Minnesota Golden Gophers in the championship. Harvard won their first NCAA Championship on April 1, 1989 when senior forward Ed Krayer score in overtime to give the Crimson a 4–3 overtime victory. Following the game, Lane MacDonald became the third player in program history to earn the Hobey Baker Award.\nRecent history.\nBill Cleary ended his tenure as head coach at the conclusion of the 1989–90 season to become the director of athletics. In his 19 seasons as head coach for the program he won 324 games and took the Crimson to the NCAA Tournament nine times, the Frozen Four on seven occasions, and the first national championship for Harvard. The ECAC regular season championship, the Cleary Cup, is named in honor of the former Harvard player, coach, and Olympian for his efforts to form the conference. Longtime assistant Ronn Tomassoni was named head coach for the following season. In his first season as head coach on February 1, 1992, Tomassoni guided Harvard to the program's 1,000 win when it defeats Union, 7–3.\nIn 1993 the team returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since their championship in 1989. The Crimson lost in double overtime to Northern Michigan 2–3. Harvard returned to the NCAA the following season in 1994 and advanced to the Frozen Four with a 7–1 win over New Hampshire. In the NCAA semifinal the Crimson fell to Lake Superior State 3–2 in overtime. finishing the year a record of 24–5–4. The appearance in the 1994 Frozen Four was the last of the program to date.\nMark Mazzoleni became the tenth coach in program history on July 16, 1999. Under Mazzoleni the Crimson reached the NCAA Tournament three straight seasons in 2001–02, 2002–03, and 2003–04. The streak was extended to five straight seasons, tying a program high, by Ted Donato in 2004–05 and 2005–06.\nAdam Fox played for the team as a freshman for the 2016–17 season, led all NCAA defensemen with 40 points, and led all NCAA defensemen and all NCAA freshmen skaters in assists with 34, as he played 35 games. He was named 2017 ECAC Rookie of the Year and Ivy League Rookie of the Year. In his junior 2018–19 season, he was the top scoring player and defenseman in the country with 1.45 points per game. He led the NCAA in assists, while also setting school single-season records for assists by a defenseman. Fox also broke the school record for points by a Harvard defenseman in one season, set by Mark Fusco in 1983.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nChampionships.\nBeanpot championships.\nChampionships: 1953, 1955, 1960, 1962, 1969, 1974, 1977, 1981, 1989, 1993, 2017\nCoaches.\nHarvard's men's team has been in continual operation since 1897 with two notable exceptions. The university did not field a team for the 1917–18 season nor was there a team from 1943 through the spring of 1945. These three seasons were lost as a result of the two world wars that occurred during the first half of the 20th century.

        "title": "Colgate Raiders men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Colgate Raiders men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Colgate University. The Raiders are a member of ECAC Hockey. They used to play at Starr Rink from its inauguration in 1959 until the 2015–16 season. Starting with the 2016–17 NCAA season, the Raiders have started playing their home games in the Class of 1965 Arena. The program is located in Hamilton, New York.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nColgate's ice hockey team began as a four-game experiment in 1916 and 1917. The program was put on ice during World War I but returned in 1920 with a coach leading the Red Raiders. James Ballantine stayed with Colgate for eight years despite the program being mothballed in 1923 and remaining fallow until 1928. After ensuring the team returned he handed the coaching duties over to Ray Watkins who stayed for four uneventful seasons before assistant professor of Physical Education John Howard Starr took over. Starr spent the first four seasons toiling with losing records before both he and the team started to turn the Red Raiders' fortunes. In the late 1930s Colgate started posting lofty records of 8–1 and 9–4 and continued doing so into the early-40s. In 1942 Starr left the program to volunteer for service in World War II. The team continued on for two seasons, posting an undefeated record in 1943 of 11–0, before being suspended for the final year of the war. Once peace had been achieved Starr and the team returned. After a down season in 1946 the Red Raiders earned their second undefeated record, going 14–0 in 1946–47. The team kept up its winning ways until 1950 when Starr resigned as head coach. The new bench boss, Tom Dockrell got off to a slow start with the Red Raiders who became a founding member of the first ice hockey conference, the Tri-State League, but didn't get an opportunity to improve his record due to unseasonably warm weather that caused the program to cease operations for the next six years.\nIndoor ice and the ECAC.\nColgate finally returned to the ice in 1958 and continued with new head coach Olav Kollevoll for two seasons before their first indoor ice rink was finished. The building was dedicated to the former coach as the J. Howard Starr Rink at the first game played on its surface in December 1959. With the stability of the program ensured the team was able to build itself into a respectable unit, producing increasing win totals into the early 1960s and founding its second conference, ECAC Hockey along with 27 other schools. Colgate finished their first year of conference play with an 18–6 mark, setting a new school record for wins and finishing tied for 6th but it wasn't enough to earn them a selection as one of the top 8 teams in the conference so they missed the playoffs. The following year saw the team slip to 7th in the ECAC but this time they received an entry into the postseason, losing to eventual champion Harvard in the quarterfinals. The next year brought the team record up to 19 wins and a second playoff berth where they once again lost to the eventual ECAC champion in their first game, this time to Providence. After a down year in 1965 Kollevoll was replaced by Ron Ryan who held the reins for seven seasons but could only lead the team to middling results most years. After two poor showings in the early '70s the team passed through three coaches over five years, eventually landing with former St. Lawrence player Terry Slater.\nRise to prominence and tragedy.\nSlater's first season was an unmitigated disaster, with the team posting its worst record since tournament play began but that was wiped away in his second season when the Red Raiders posted their first winning season since 1970. The following season brought Colgate its first ECAC playoff in over a decade and in 1981 Colgate notched its first 20+ win season, its first ECAC playoff win and its first appearance in the NCAA tournament. Slater would keep Colgate in good standing for the duration of the 1980s, posing winning records in all but one season, however, the Red Raiders couldn't get out of the ECAC quarterfinals in any of their succeeding appearances. All of that changed in 1989–90 when Colgate jumped out with a tremendous start and never looked back. The team won its first ECAC regular season championship by a huge margin and swept its way through the ECAC tournament to take its first conference title. The Red Raiders received the second eastern seed and a bye into the Quarterfinals where they defeated Lake Superior State in two close games. After downing Boston University in the semifinal Colgate only had Wisconsin left in they way but were unable to overcome the Badgers and had to settle for Runner-Up. Colgate predictably declined from its team-record 31 wins the next season but still posted a decent record. In December 1991 Terry Slater suffered a severe stroke and was hospitalized, dying four days later at the age of 54. His death gutted the team, but they still managed a respectable year in his absence.\nContinued success.\nDon Vaughan arrived in 1992 to help heal the program and while the team struggled through sub-par seasons early on there were some encouraging signs with scattered postseason wins. By the mid-1990s the Red Raiders were posing winning records once more and by the end of the millennium Colgate found itself back in the NCAA tournament. Vaughan was so respected by the administration that he was tasked with serving as the interim Athletic Director for the 2003–04 school year, allowing his assistant Stan Moore to lead the team to an ECAC title and earn an ECAC Coach of the Year Award in the process. Not to be outdone, Vaughan returned to the bench the next year and got a second trip to the NCAA tournament followed by his own ECAC title the season after. Vaughan continues to coach the Raiders and now in his 26th season he holds the school record for wins, losses and ties while having produced several NHL players along with many more professional alumni across Europe and North America.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nIndividual.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual.\nPlayer of the Year\nTim Taylor Award\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nKen Dryden Award\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nTournament MOP\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond team all-ecac hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Colgate alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nPlayers.\nWHA.\nTwo players were members of WHA teams."

        "title": "Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Clarkson University. The Golden Knights have been a member of ECAC Hockey since 1962, and play their home games at Cheel Arena in Potsdam, New York. While Clarkson lore has it that their first hockey game was played in 1916 against the Hogansburg Indians, the team was established as a hockey club in 1921, led by captain Bill Johnson. The Knights won their opening encounter against Alexandria Bay, 6–4, and finished the year with a 2–1 record, their first of many winning seasons.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nClarkson College of Technology started its hockey team in 1921, only 25 years after the school's founding. The program played as a minor sport until the mid 1930s but routinely finished with winning records. In 1937–38 The Golden Knights completed a 13–1–1 record and were named the US Intercollegiate champions. A year later the University opened its first indoor rink, the Clarkson Arena, which would serve the college until 1991. The program took a slight downturn in the 1940s and then suspended operations for two years due to the outbreak of World War II but returned to the ice the year after the war ended. When The first college hockey tournament began in 1947 Clarkson was in the running for selection but was beaten out for the two eastern slots. Three years and one coaching change later, Clarkson College became a founding member of the first college ice hockey conference, the Tri-State League. The Golden Knights not only won the conference with a 4–1 record, but because they tied with Middlebury, they also participated in the first conference playoff game to determine the sole champion and were victorious. Unfortunately the team's 12–2–1 mark was still not good enough to receive an invitation to the NCAA tournament. The program continued to build until they produced a superb 23–0 record in 1956 with NCAA scoring champion Ed Rowe leading the way. 'Tech' finally received an NCAA invitation but it came with a caveat; because eight of their players were 4-year lettermen they would have to sit out the tournament for Clarkson to participate. Because of this the team voted to pass on the invitation. The Golden Knights wouldn't have to wait long for their first tournament appearance, however, as they were invited the following year and finished in third place. After a second consecutive third-place head coach Bill Harrison resigned and turned the team over to Len Ceglarski. The first few years under Ceglarski saw the team's record dip slightly but stating in his third season the Golden Knights became a constant power in college hockey.\nECAC Powerhouse.\nClarkson was one of 28 founding members of the ECAC in 1961 and finished in second place both in the conference and the ECAC tournament. Clarkson was invited to the NCAA tournament, boasting the top offense in the nation and used its firepower to down Michigan in the semifinal but couldn't repeat the performance in the title match and fell to Michigan Tech 1–7. Clarkson made the tournament the following year but finished with its third #3 finish. In 1966 Clarkson posted a superb season, winning the ICAC and ECAC crowns before taking its first ECAC Tournament. In the tournament Clarkson faced relatively weak opponents (the 4th- and 6th-place teams from the WCHA) and though they managed to win their semifinal matchup, they couldn't take advantage in the title tilt and fell to Michigan State 1–6. Tech continued to play well over the next few years but would not return to the NCAA tournament until 1970. After defeating the top western team in the semifinal, Clarkson faced off against the undefeated Cornell Big Red and fought tooth and nail for their first championship. The game was tied after both the first and second period with the Golden Knights having taken the lead twice on the strength of Bruce Bullock's goaltending but a natural hat trick by Cornell's Dan Lodboa in the third frame put the game out of reach and Clarkson had to settle for runner-up for the third time. The following year Clarkson finished in second place for both the ECAC and their conference tournament but received a slap in the face from the selection committee when they were passed over for Boston University as the second eastern team. To add insult to injury, the Terriers went on to claim the championship that year. A year later Len Ceglarski would leave the program to take over at his alma mater Boston College, having led Clarkson to 12 consecutive seasons of at least a .600 winning percentage.\nIntermittent Success.\nJerry York, another BC grad, would take over in 1973 and, as it had under Ceglarski, the program's record slumped. It took four years for Tech to climb back to its lofty perch and in 1977 it did just that with future NHL all-star Dave Taylor leading the way. Clarkson finished with the best record in the ECAC and went into the postseason as one of the favorites for the national championship. Unfortunately the team hit a roadblock in the semifinal, losing to Boston University 6–7 and finished the ECAC tournament in 4th place. Once Taylor left the program dipped but still performed well. However, in 1979 York left for greener pastures, turning the team over to Clarkson alumnus Bill O'Flaherty. In O'Flaherty's six seasons behind the bench the Golden Knights never finished with a record below .600 and captured two ECAC titles. Though Tech wouldn't win any of those ECAC tournaments, the expanded NCAA tournament allowed Clarkson to earn three at-large bids into the national tournament. The Golden Knights record in the NCAA tournament was disappointing, going 1–4–1 in three tries and losing in the first round each time. O'Flaherty would turn the team over to former NHL-er Cap Raeder in 1985 and the new coach would shepherd the team well over three seasons but it wasn't until Mark Morris took the reins in 1988 that the program would return to prominence once more.\n90's Resurgence.\nThough Clarkson hadn't had a losing season since 1975 when Morris took over, the team had an air of underachieving about it especially when it came to postseason results. Tech proceeded to produce steadily increasing results in Morris' first three seasons, culminating with a program-record 29-win season in 1991 that also saw the Golden Knights win their first ECAC tournament since 1966. Despite the top finish Clarkson received no respect from the selection committee and was seeded 4th in the eastern bracket despite having a better record than the 2nd- and 3rd-seeded schools. Clarkson pushed past the slight and defeated defending champion Wisconsin in the first round series. In the Quarterfinals Tech took on the top western seed, Lake Superior State, and triumphed in the series 2 games to 1. The Golden Knights reached the frozen four for the first time in 21 years but the magic wore off once they did and they fell to BU 3–7. Clarkson's performance in the 1991 tournament gave them enough credibility to earn an NCAA bid despite flaming out in the ECAC tournament the following year. Similar to what they had done under Ceglarski, Clarkson never had a sub-.600 record during the entire decade, winning four ECAC titles, three conference tournaments and making the NCAA tournament nine out of ten seasons. Despite the success the Golden Knights wilted once they entered the national tournament. Aside from their semifinal run in 1991 Clarkson won only one game in eight other appearances.\nFiring and Decline.\nTech's record slipped with the dawn of a new millennium but Morris' teams still produced winning records. Clarkson was expected to continue this trend for years to come but in November 2002 Morris was suspended following an altercation with one of his players after a team practice. After a 10-day inquiry Morris was dismissed from the team and his assistant Fred Parker took over in the interim. The team played flat most of the rest of the season, posting the program's first losing record in almost 30 years and their worst winning percentage in over 40 seasons. Parker was replaced by George Roll they following year and after a slow start, the Golden Knights recovered and finished as runner-ups in the ECAC tournament. After two middling seasons Clarkson returned to its superior success with a 25-win season in 2007 where the team captured its fifth ECAC tournament title. After winning the regular season ECAC crown the next season Clarkson dropped in the standings, finishing the next three seasons with losing records and, in 2010, posting the program's worst season since before the second world war.\nSlow Climb Back.\nRoll was fired in 2011 with the program at its nadir, becoming the only full-time head coach to finish his tenure at Clarkson with a losing record. His former assistant Casey Jones was eventually selected as the replacement and a slow climb out of the cellar began. It took three seasons before Tech had another winning season and wasn't until 2018 that Clarkson made an appearance in the NCAA tournament. The Golden Knights would lose in the first round that year but with four players making the ECAC all-rookie team over the previous two seasons Clarkson was well placed to improve their standing over the next few years.\nClarkson, which became the fastest Division I college hockey program to compile 1,000 victories and one of only a few to reach that mark, has compiled a 1436–862–160 record for an all-time winning percentage of , which is among the best in the country.\nClarkson has had 36 individuals earn All-American honors since 1928, including 13 who have won the honor twice. Defenseman Fred Dion and center Buzz Williams were the first Golden Knights to receive the honor in 1928–29.\nThe 2020–21 season was cancelled prior to the ECAC tournament due to the team violating COVID-19 protocols.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nAwards and honors.\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nNCAA Division I Ice Hockey Scoring Champion\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nECAC Hockey Player of the Year\nECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Forward\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman\nKen Dryden Award\nECAC Hockey Student-Athlete of the Year\nTim Taylor Award\nECAC Hockey Most Outstanding Player in Tournament\nAll-ECAC.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nClarkson Athletic Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with Clarkson's men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Clarkson University Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nPlayers.\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Clarkson alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nWHA.\nThree players were members of WHA teams."

        "text": "The Brown Bears men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Brown University. The Bears are a member of ECAC Hockey. They play at the Meehan Auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island.\nHistory.\nThe men's ice hockey team at Brown is one of the country's oldest programs, having played their first game in 1898. That season, the team helped to form the first informal conference, the Intercollegiate Hockey Association, and wound up winning the league championship. While there was no formal declaration at the time, Brown's title is sometimes referred to as the first ice hockey national championship. Brown nearly repeated the feat three years later but ultimately fell to Yale in the first two playoff games ever contested for college ice hockey.\nThe program swiftly declined after that near miss and the Bears became one of the worst teams in the nation. By 1906 the team had lost 16 straight contests, failing to score a goal in 9 games during that stretch. The program suspended operations after 1906 and remained shuttered for 20 years. When they returned to the ice they debuted with their first official head coach. Though James Gardner only lasted one season behind the bench the team performed much better with a hand at the tiller and quickly built up to be a respected program. In 1939 the team again suspended operations, though this time it was due to the onset of World War II. Brown's team remained out of commission for the entire duration of the war and didn't return until several years after its conclusion, finally hitting the ice again in 1947. \nIn only 4 years the team climbed all the way to 17–5 record, receiving the top eastern seed for the 1951 NCAA tournament. Though they ultimately fell in the title game, Brown had become one of the better teams in college hockey and, excluding a brief period in the early '60s, would remain so for the next 30 years. When the 1980s rolled around the Bears results started turning sour and Brown found itself looking up at the rest of college hockey. Since 1981 Brown has produced only six winning seasons and more than half of their campaigns have ended with single-digit win totals. The Bears had a brief resurgence in the mid-1990s, managing to make the tournament in 1993 but bowed out after only 1 game.\nBrown Olympians.\nBrown has sent five members of its team to the Olympics. Three former players, Donald Whiston (Silver, 1952), Robert Gaudreau (1968) and Mike Mastrullo (1984 and 1992) represented their respective nations as players, former player Tim Bothwell was an assistant coach on the gold medal-winning 2006 Canadian women's team and former assistant coach Jack Ferreira was an assistant GM for the US men's team in 1998.\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nDerek Hines Unsung Hero Award\nNCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nECAC Hockey Player of the Year\nECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year\nTim Taylor Award\nECAC Hockey Outstanding Defenseman\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman\nKen Dryden Award\nAll-ECAC.\nFirst Team\nSecond team\nThird Team\nAll-Rookie Team\nBrown Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of Brown's men's ice hockey players who were elected into the Brown University Athletic Hall of Fame (graduating class in parentheses).\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nBears in the NHL.\nThe following is a list of Brown's men's ice hockey alumni who played in the NHL/WHA.\nWHA.\nSeveral players also were members of WHA teams."

        "text": "There are four cricket grounds at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan national sports institute in Savar, Dhaka. As well as serving the needs of the BKSP's students, the grounds have also staged first-class and List A cricket matches in Bangladeshi domestic competitions since 2000, and several minor international matches.\nHistory.\nThe No 1 Ground was the first of the four grounds to be developed and was the first to be used for Bangladeshi domestic competitions in 2000. The facilities at the other three grounds have been upgraded in recent years with the help of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Grounds 2, 3 and 4 are now regularly used for first-class and List A cricket. They serve as neutral grounds in domestic competitions.\nBangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 1 Ground.\nSituated on the right just inside the main entrance to the BKSP complex, the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 1 Ground has been in operation since the late 1980s. It first staged matches in the Dhaka Premier Division senior limited-overs tournament in 1996. Its first international matches came in 1998: three warm-up matches for the Wills International Cup.\nThe first first-class matches were in the National Cricket League in 2000–01, when the ground served as the home ground for Biman Bangladesh Airlines. The last first-class matches so far were in 2009–10. Bangladesh A also played first-class matches at the ground against the touring Pakistanis in 2001–02, and Sri Lanka A in 2005–06. The first List A matches were four in the one-day National Cricket League in 2000–01. The last were in 2008–09.\nIn all, the ground has staged 10 first-class and 10 List A matches.\nBangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 2 Ground.\nThe other three grounds are located further inside the BKSP complex. Apart from matches in the major domestic competitions, all of the grounds are in constant use for minor matches.\nThe Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 2 Ground hosted its first domestic first-class and List A matches in 2006. Bangladesh A also played two first-class matches there in 2010. Up to the end of the 2014–15 season the ground had staged 19 first-class, 21 List A and three Twenty20 matches. In 2011 it also held three matches in the qualifying series for the Women's Cricket World Cup.\nBangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 3 Ground.\nThe No 3 and No 4 grounds, situated side by side, share their facilities. Each has a crowd capacity of about 2000. At first, when the List A Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League was played at the grounds in 2013–14, the standard of the facilities received some criticism from the players.\nThe Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 3 Ground has been used for domestic first-class and especially List A cricket since 2013–14. It is one of the principal grounds used in the Dhaka Premier League. Up to the end of the 2016–17 season the ground had staged 17 first-class and 99 List A matches. In 2011 it also held two matches in the qualifying series for the Women's World Cup.\nIn 2013–14, Rajshahi Division, batting first, lost their first six wickets for 77 but finished by declaring at 675 for 9. Farhad Reza scored 259. In 2014–15, Mosaddek Hossain made 250 on the No 3 Ground, then scored 282 on the No 2 Ground five days later. Shuvagata Hom equalled the National League record when he took six catches in the match for Dhaka Division against Chittagong Division at the ground in 2014–15.\nIn September 2015 the BKSP 3 &amp; 4 grounds hosted the ICRC International T20 Cricket Tournament for people with physical disabilities.\nBangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 4 Ground.\nThe Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan No 4 Ground has staged two first-class matches in 2013–14 and one in 2016–17, and 36 List A matches. It was one of the three grounds chosen for the 2016-17 Dhaka Premier Division, when it staged 27 List A matches.\nIn the first first-class match at the ground, in the National Cricket League, Dhaka Division, batting first, made 756 for 5 declared, the National League record total, four batsmen scoring centuries. The match ended in a draw when Rajshahi Division, set 607 to win, finished on 272 for 9 after their last-wicket pair held out for the last 8.2 overs."

Three new venues were added for alpine skiing which had been added to the Winter Olympics program twelve years earlier in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany (Allied-occupied Germany during the 1948 Games). As of 2015, the bob run continues to be used for bobsleigh and the Cresta Run for skeleton while alpine skiing remains popular in St. Moritz.\nBefore the Olympics.\nSt. Moritz hosted the Winter Olympics previously in 1928. All five venues from those games were reused for the 1948 Winter Olympics. St. Moritz hosted the FIBT World Championships in 1931 (four-man), 1937 (four-man), 1938 (two-man), 1939 (two-man), and 1947. Switzerland itself hosted the Ice Hockey World Championships twice in between the 1928 and 1948 Games, doing so in 1935 and 1939 though neither took place in St. Moritz. As an alpine skiing venue, St. Moritz hosted the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 1934.\nDuring the Olympics.\nMidway through the second run of the bobsleigh four-man event, a water pipe burst which halted competition. They still completed all four runs of the event.\nAfter the Olympics.\nThe ski jump was renovated in 1963 to get it to a K-point of . It closed in 2006. The bob run has hosted the FIBT World Championships sixteen more times since the 1948 Games, most recently in 2007. St. Moritz hosted its first recorded alpine skiing World Cup event in 1971. The city hosted the Alpine skiing World Championships in 1974 and 2003."

During their tour they played eight matches, six in the United States of America and two in Canada. The tour contained two first-class fixtures, both contested against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia.\nC.W. Alcock of Surrey originally intended to take the team, but finding himself unable to go had to find a successor. Lord Hawke took on the role of organising the tour. The team was weaker than he wished but the inclusion of Sammy Woods at the last hour considerably strengthed the bowling. Woods turned out to be the success of the tour, taking 76 wickets in the 8 matches at an average of 7, as well as scoring 260 runs.\nMatches.\nFirst-class matches.\nThe party left Liverpool on 16 September 1891, and during the voyage Herbie Hewett, George Ricketts and Charles Wreford-Brown suffered badly from seasickness. Sammy Woods, who was not affected by such ailments, attempted to get the three men to take dinner with him on the fourth evening. He served champagne and vegetable soup, but an American who was also suffering from nausea commented \"Say steward, did you bring this up or did I?\" None of Woods' three team-mates ate the dinner. The party landed in New York on the evening of 23 September and immediately made their way to Philadelphia for a half-day's practice before their first match."

The games were awarded to Toronto, Ontario, Canada on November 6, 2009. The other shortlisted cities were Lima, Peru and Bogota, Colombia. Toronto won an absolute majority of votes after just one round of voting, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds of voting. PASO delegates and the media identified a number of factors in its favor, including the size of the country, safety, experience in staging multi sporting events, government guarantees, security, and cleanliness. Moreover, the other two nations are not as developed, and with the troubles faced with the 2011 Pan American Games, Toronto was seen as the favourite. Mario Vazquez Rana, the president of the Pan American Sports Organization was also known to be favouring Toronto. Moreover, the head of Lima's bid Ricardo Mungi even admitted Toronto was the best choice as they had the facilities and budget to stage the games.\nHost city selection.\nBecause there is no longer a formal process of rotation between the 3 Regions of the Americas policy,and the previous games would have been held in Central America/Caribbean (2003), South America (2007), and North America (2011). It was suggested that bids from Canada or the United States may have an edge. The United States did not bid so as not to interfere with its ultimately unsuccessful 2016 Olympic bid. Nevertheless, South American candidates lobbied as heavily as Canada did.\nOn November 6, 2009 in Guadalajara, Mexico, the candidate cities made their final presentations to the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO). After the first round of ballots, the host was announced by PASO as Toronto.\nShowed preliminary interest.\nThe city of Mar del Plata indicated preliminary interest in bidding for the games to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1995 Pan American Games held in the city. However, at the bidding deadline the city decided against bidding for the games.\nSan Jose initially indicated an interest in bidding the games, in the end San Jose decided against bidding. If San Jose was successful, it would have become the first city to stage the Pan American Games in Central America.\nAs of April 2009, Birmingham mayor Larry Langford was discussing a bid, but the deadline to apply had already passed.\nThe United States showed preliminary interest in bidding with one of three cities (Chicago, Miami or Detroit). However, the country decided to not bid for the games, because it decided to bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics with Chicago."

        "text": "Kandy Sports Club (better known as Kandy SC) is a Division 'A' rugby union team, based in Kandy, Sri Lanka, competing in the Dialog Rugby League. The club has been the most successful Sri Lankan club in the Sri Lanka Rugby Championship, winning 18 league titles in the last twenty years, which is the most wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950. The club has also won twenty Clifford Cups and in the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC had won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.\nHistory.\nThe Kandy Sports Club was founded in 1874 by a group expatriate coffee planters and others working in the plantations sector in and around Kandy, as the Kandy Athletic, Boating, Cricket, Football and Dancing Club. In 1888, 14 years later, the name was changed to Kandy Sports Club when the club also started playing rugby, hockey and polo. The home grounds was Bogambara grounds until 1939 when the British Colonial Army took over during the Second World War. Later the buildings were taken over by the General Hospital to house its offices, however Kandy SC continued to play rugby at the Bogambara grounds without a club house. In 1949 the Municipal Council released the garbage dumping ground area at Nittawela to the club.\nFrom 1997 to 2009 Kandy SC has won every President's Trophy Knockout Tournament with the exception of the 1998 series, where it lost 26-30 in the final round to Ceylonese Rugby &amp; Football Club (CR&amp;FC).\nOn March 10, 2010 the rugby team of the Kandy Sports Club left for a 15-day tour of Dubai and South Africa. The club played one match in Dubai and two in South Africa. This was the first time Kandy SC toured two different countries on one tour.\nPlayers.\nThe Kandy Sports Club was founded by a group expatriate coffee planters, however it has mainly had local players coming in from Kandyan school teams, namely Trinity College, Kandy and tradition in Sri Lanka, Kingswood College which was the first school to introduce rugby in Sri Lanka (by L. E. Blaze, an Old-Trinitian), though it gave up the game soon after and St. Anthony’s College which joined in as a progressive force. Other schools like Vidyartha College, Dharmaraja College and St. Sylvester's College have also had a long history in the sport while producing many players.\nCurrent squad.\nThe squad as of January 2022\nNigel Ratwatte\nSanushka Abeywickrama\nHeshan Jansen\nTharinda Rathwatte\nDilushka Dange\nSrinath Sooriyabandara\nChathura Zoysa\nLasitha Attangoda\nAli Mohamed\nCharles Praveen\nThilina Bandara\nRoshan Weerarathne\nJason Dissanayake\nNotable players.\nThe Kandy Sports Club has had some notable players including players who have played internationally and internationals who have played for Kandy. Some notable players include: Sri Lanka skipper and dynamic Anthonian Priyantha Ekanayake with Lakshaman Ekanayake, Indrajith Bandaranayake, Nalaka Weerakkoddy, Leroy Fonseka, Manjula Pathirana, Shyam Sideek, Rizvi Suhaib, Inthi Marikar, Lasantha Wijesuriya, Fijians Kitioni Ratrudradra, Bati Penaia, Tony Greanny and Viliame Satala.\nOut of the key expat players over the years Meli Nakauta &amp; Viliame Satala have represented Fiji in the World Cup in 1999, Manasa Qoro in 1987, while Kitioni Ratudrara, &amp; Apisai Nagata have also represented Fiji at the highest level\nClub honours.\n2018-19"

The competition was held from 31 July 1952 to 1 August 1952. 66 fencers from 26 nations competed. Nations were limited to three fencers each. The event was won by Pál Kovács, the sixth of nine straight Games in which a Hungarian would win the event. Kovács became the fourth man to win multiple medals in the individual sabre, adding to his 1948 bronze. Hungary swept the medals in the event for the second time (the first was in 1912). Aladár Gerevich's silver completed a set of three different color medals in the event, the first man to win three medals in individual sabre. Tibor Berczelly earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Seven of the eight finalists from 1948 returned (all except American Tibor Nyilas: gold medalist (and 1936 bronze medalist) Aladár Gerevich of Hungary, silver medalist (and 1936 finalist) Vincenzo Pinton of Italy, bronze medalist Pál Kovács of Hungary, fourth-place finisher Jacques Lefèvre of France, fifth-place finisher George Worth of the United States, sixth-place finisher Gastone Darè of Italy, and eighth-place finisher Antonio Haro of Mexico. Gerevich was the reigning (1951) world champion, with Darè (1949) and Jean Levavasseur of France (1950) other recent world champions competing. Kovács was also a world champion, though not so recently—he had won in 1937.\nAustralia, Guatemala, Japan, Saar, the Soviet Union, Portugal, and Venezuela each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy and Denmark each made their 10th appearance in the event, tied for most of any nation, each having missed two of the first three events but having appeared every Games since 1908.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format was pool play round-robin, with bouts to five touches.

The competition was held from 29 July 1952, to 30 July 1952. 85 fencers from 19 nations competed.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format continued the pool play round-robin from prior years. Each of the four fencers from one team would face each of the four from the other, for a total of 16 bouts per match. The team that won more bouts won the match, with competition potentially stopping when one team reached 9 points out of the possible 16 (this did not always occur and matches sometimes continued).

In the second set of matches, Hungary defeated Belgium 13–3 and France defeated Austria 10–6. In the first of the two final matches, Hungary defeated Austria 12–4 to secure first place in the group and eliminate Austria (who would come third regardless of the result between France and Belgium). Belgium (0–2, 10–22 in bouts) and France (1–1, 13–19 in bouts) faced off for the second advancement spot; Belgium would need to win by at least 10–6 to overcome France's advantage in bouts (the tie-breaker if France, Austria, and Belgium all finished at 1–2). When France took a 7th bout in the match after a 6–6 start, the French were guaranteed second place in the group even if Belgium were to win the final three bouts (and thus the match); those final three bouts were not played and France was declared the match victor 7–6.\nSemifinal 2.\nIn the first pairing, Italy defeated Great Britain 11–5 and the United States beat Poland 10–6. In the second set of matches, the United States defeated Great Britain 9–5 and Italy defeated Poland 11–4. The two 2–0 teams advanced without playing each other; the two 0–2 teams likewise did not play each other.\nFinal.\nIn the first pairings, Hungary defeated France 13–3 and Italy beat the United States 12–4. The second set of matches featured Hungary defeating the United States and Italy beating France, each by a score of 13–3. This made the France vs. United States match a \"de facto\" bronze medal match, won by France 8–6. (The match was stopped at 8 wins because the United States trailed in touches against 60–48 and even if the Americans won by the final two bouts 5–0 apiece to even the bouts at 8–8, the French would win on touches against 60–58). The Hungary vs. Italy match was for the gold medal. Italy took a 7–6 lead, but Hungary won the next two bouts to go ahead 8–7. The final bout (between each team's top fencers, Kovács and Darè) never took place; Hungary's 64–50 touch lead was so great that even had Darè been able to beat Kovács 5–0 to draw the teams even on bouts 8–8 the Hungarians would nevertheless win the match."

        "title": "Proposed Major League Baseball franchises in Portland, Oregon",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises have been proposed in Portland, Oregon on two occasions. The Oregon Stadium Campaign and the City of Portland were involved in creating a presentation for a committee in charge of relocating the Montreal Expos in 2003. The proposal included possible sites for new baseball parks. In the midst of the campaign for the Expos, the Oregon State Legislature passed a bill that secured US$150 million in funds for a new stadium, that can still be used. The proposal was passed up and Washington, D.C. was selected as the new home of the Expos. In 2007, the Florida Marlins considered re-locating to Portland. On both occasions, PGE Park, the minor league baseball park at the time, would have been used until a new stadium could be completed. Currently, the Portland metropolitan area is the largest metro area in the United States that houses another major league sports franchise (the Portland Timbers and the Portland Trail Blazers) without having an MLB franchise.\nProposed teams.\nMontreal Expos relocation (2002–2003).\nAfter MLB made it official the Montreal Expos were going to be relocated, Portland was named as a potential candidate. Then-Portland Mayor Vera Katz and other officials went to New York City to address the committee that was in charge of the Expos relocation. In 2003, the Oregon State Legislature passed Senate Bill 5, which provided US$150 million towards a new stadium. If the Expos did move to Portland, under the proposal set forth by the then-mayor would use PGE Park as the team's temporary stadium. The Expos were eventually awarded to Washington, D.C. and now play as the Washington Nationals.\nFlorida Marlins possible relocation (2006–2007).\nIn 2006, there was question of whether or not the Florida Marlins would be able to secure the funds for a new stadium. This opened a proposal for the Marlins to be relocated to Portland. Former professional baseball player Johnny Pesky, who is a Portland native, expressed his desire to see an MLB franchise in his home town stating, \"Why shouldn't Portland have a club? I think they should get a shot. I think Portland will have a team in three or four years.\" The proposed plan would use the funds secured from Senate Bill 5 to build a new stadium. While it was being built, the team would play in PGE Park, which would be expanded into a 25,000 seat facility as a quick fix. On January 6, 2006, Marlins officials visited Portland as a possible re-location site. The officials included team president David Samson, vice chairman Joel Mael and Claude Delorme. Six other cities were possible re-locations sites along with Portland. The Marlins ultimately stayed in Miami and went on to build LoanDepot Park, which opened in 2012.\nPortland Diamond Project (2017–).\nIn 2017, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred announced that an ownership group led by retired Nike vice president Craig Cheek and former Portland Trail Blazers broadcaster Mike Barrett are working to secure financing for a stadium and bring Major League Baseball to Portland. On April 17, 2018, the potential ownership group, Portland Diamond Project, submitted formal proposals to purchase one of two potential stadium sites close to downtown Portland. One site was Portland Public Schools' headquarters, located north of the Moda Center, and the other location is an industrial site in Northwest Portland However, on November 7, 2018, the offer for the PPS site was formally retracted by the Portland Diamond Project.\nOn June 1, 2018 it was announced that former Seattle Seahawks quarterback, current Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, and former Colorado Rockies farmhand Russell Wilson is investing in the Portland Diamond Project, along with his wife, singer, songwriter and entertainer Ciara. In 2019, former MLB player and Portland native Darwin Barney was also investing in the project.\nPortland Diamond Ballpark.\nOn November 29, 2018, the Portland Diamond Project (PDP) announced that it had reached an agreement to build a baseball park on the 45-acre Terminal 2 of the Port of Portland in the Northwest Industrial neighborhood of the city. The park, designed by Populous in partnership with TVA Architects, will be located on the Willamette River. It will have a capacity of 32,000 to 34,000 and will include a retractable roof as well as a gondola lift suite. Construction is estimated to cost around $1 billion and efforts to get a Major League Baseball team to occupy it could cost the same.\nIn 2023, PDP announced that it was now considering two potential sites for a ballpark: at the Lloyd Center shopping mall in downtown Portland and the Redtail Golf Course in Beaverton. In January 2024, they announced they were in negotiations to purchase the 164-acre Redtail site.\nInvolved organizations.\nThree groups, the Oregon Sports Authority, the Portland Baseball Group and Oregon Baseball Campaign, came together for an organization known as the Oregon Stadium Campaign (OSC) to advance the hopes of location an MLB team in Portland.\nMarket.\nESPN.com reported that the Portland metropolitan area was a bigger location than the ones that house the Cincinnati Reds, the Kansas City Royals and the Milwaukee Brewers. As of 2010, Portland was the largest market in the United States and the second largest in North America that houses a major league sports team (the Portland Timbers and the Portland Trail Blazers) without an MLB team. While the Oregon Sports Authority acknowledged in their official proposal that there may be bigger markets with more corporate support, they touted Portland's natural beauty, livability, metropolitan growth rate and television ratings as reason to award Portland with a team.\nPublic opinion.\nThe Oregon Sports Authority cited a poll taken by Grove Insight in March 2003 in their official proposal that stated that over half of Oregon residents claimed that they would attend an MLB game each season. Furthermore, the poll also stated that 60 percent of Multnomah County residents would be \"likely\" to attend a game and 41 percent would be \"very likely\"."

        "title": "2011 Vuelta a España",
        "text": "The 2011 Vuelta a España was held from 20 August to 11 September. The bicycle race began in Benidorm with a team time trial and ended, as is traditional, in Madrid. The 2011 Vuelta was the 66th edition of the race and was the first Vuelta in 33 years that visited the Basque Country. The 33-year absence from the region was due to fear of political protests.\nCommentators claimed that it was a race well suited for climbers due to the short time trials and the large number of climbing kilometres. Nine of the twenty-one stages were ranked as Mountain stages, and six of them had a mountain-top finish (including the very steep uphill finish on the Alto de L'Angliru). Two other stages had steep uphill finishes, both of which were won by Katusha leader Joaquim Rodríguez.\nThis Vuelta saw the introduction of a combativity award, much like that in the Tour de France. The most combative rider in each stage was awarded a red back number which he wore for the next stage.\nThe victory was originally awarded to Juan José Cobo who had a race-winning margin of just 13 seconds over Briton Chris Froome. Neither rider had been marked as a pre-race favourite, and both had gone to the Vuelta as domestiques for their team leaders: Cobo for Denis Menchov, and Froome for Bradley Wiggins; their team leaders originally finished 5th and 3rd respectively. The race was the first time that two Britons had stood on the podium of a Grand Tour, and Froome's second-place finish was, at the time, the best result in a Grand Tour by a British rider, until Wiggins won the Tour de France the following year. Cobo also won the Combination Classification. The King of the Mountains competition was won for the fourth consecutive time by Frenchman David Moncoutié. The points classification was won by Dutch rider Bauke Mollema who finished 4th overall.\nOn 13 June 2019, the sport's governing body, the Union Cycliste International (UCI), announced that Cobo had been found guilty of an anti-doping violation, according to findings from his biological passport. As a result, the UCI penalised him with a three-year period of ineligibility. Cobo was officially stripped of the title on 18 June 2019. On 17 July 2019, as the time for Cobo to appeal the decision expired with no application, the UCI announced it recognised Chris Froome as the 2011 champion, making him retroactively the first Briton to win a Grand Tour. Froome was also promoted to the winning position in the combination classification. Wiggins was promoted to runner-up, his second promotion on a Grand Tour podium due to doping, and Mollema was promoted to the podium in third. \nFroome, who had in the intervening time finally won the 2017 Vuelta a España, 'on the road', officially received the 2011 winner's trophy at the start of the final stage of the 2020 edition on 8 November 2020, ironically receiving his last of seven Grand Tour prizes for his first Grand Tour victory.\nTeams.\nThe 18 teams in the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) Proteam category were obliged to enter the race. Four UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited.\nThe full list of participating teams is:\n†: Invited Pro-continental teams.\nPre-race favourites.\n2010 winner Vincenzo Nibali came to defend his Vuelta title and was seen as the favourite due to the better time-trial skills than climbers as Igor Antón, Joaquim Rodríguez and Michele Scarponi. Anton was regarded as the strongest climber in the 2010 race, but due to a crash he had to withdraw from the race. Ezequiel Mosquera did not start the race, the 2010 runner-up being suspended from racing by his team due to an ongoing doping investigation.\nTwo other Grand Tour winners in the Vuelta peloton were Carlos Sastre (winner of the 2008 Tour de France) and Denis Menchov (two-time winner of the Vuelta and winner of the 2009 Giro d'Italia). Both riders of the team were looking for better results after disappointing Giro campaigns. Sastre finished in thirtieth place, while Menchov finished eighth. Menchov had allergies and physical problems at the Giro d'Italia and was looking for a third Vuelta win. The Russian could count on one of the best team supports in the mountains with climbers as Sastre, Juan José Cobo and Fabio Duarte.\nOther favourites for the podium had had a disappointing Tour de France and were looking to improve in the Vuelta. Janez Brajkovič, Bradley Wiggins and Jurgen van den Broeck crashed out of the Tour in the first week while Andreas Klöden withdrew from the race a week later, also due to injuries of a crash. Wiggins showed good form before the Tour and was seen as a podium candidate for the Tour. His accomplished time-trialling, together with his improved climbing skills, made him a favourite for the Vuelta victory.\nAmong the top ten contenders were several promising talents, including Dan Martin (winner of the 2010 Tour de Pologne, runner up of the 2011 Tour de Pologne and third overall at the 2011 Volta a Catalunya), Steven Kruijswijk (ninth in the 2011 Giro, third overall and a mountain stage win at the 2011 Tour de Suisse), Bauke Mollema (twelfth at the 2010 Giro d'Italia and fifth overall at the 2011 Tour de Suisse) and Rein Taaramäe (twelfth at the 2011 Tour de France, third overall at the 2011 Critérium International and fourth overall at the 2011 Paris–Nice. Other contenders for the top ten were Garmin's co-leader Christophe Le Mével and Ag2R's Nicolas Roche. \nRoute and stages.\nThe full route for the 2011 Vuelta was unveiled in Benidorm on January 12, 2011. The climbers immediately liked the route of the race with six mountain stages with uphill finishes and another two flat stages with steep uphill finishes. Among the uphill finishes were the infamous Alto de L'Angliru and the climb to the Sierra Nevada. Two finishes were on climbs that have never been featured in the Vuelta before. These are to Estacion de Montaña Manzaneda in Galicia on stage 11 and La Farrapona in the Asturias region on stage 14. Olympic Road Champion Samuel Sánchez pointed out that the lack of Time Trial kilometres make the race very interesting because there are not enough of them for GC riders with good time trialing ability to take advantage for the variety of mountain stages.\nIt was the first Vuelta since 33 years that visited the Basque Country. The 33-year absence of the region was due to fear of political protests. Separatists of the Basque Country were unhappy with the return of the Vuelta and calling the coming of the Vuelta 'A Waste of Money'. Although the criticism of several Separatists on the route of this year, the organizers of the Vuelta announced on 8 September that the 2012 event will start in the Navarrese city of Pamplona.\nRace overview.\n\"For details see 2011 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2011 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21\"\nThe Vuelta began with a team time trial in Benidorm. The squad won this stage. Danish General Classification contender Jakob Fuglsang passed the finish line as first and was the first cyclist to wear the red leaders jersey. Fuglsang lost the leaders jersey after just one day to team-mate Daniele Bennati in a sprinter's stage which was won by Christopher Sutton of .\nStage 3 saw the first victory out of a break-away. Out of this break-away it was Pablo Lastras () who attacked on the last climb and held a small margin until the finish line in Totana. Runner-up of the stage, Sylvain Chavanel (), was the third cyclist who was awarded the red leaders jersey.\nNo serious attacks were made by the GC contenders on the first mountain stage of the Vuelta. On the climb to the Sierra Nevada it was Daniel Moreno () who attacked with Chris Anker Sørensen () and who beat the Danish climber in the sprint. Chavanel was the first rider who was awarded the leaders jersey two days in a row.\nIgor Antón () won in the 2009 Vuelta a España the stage on the steep ascend of Valdepeñas de Jaén. The Basque lost much time on stage 4 and showed no good form in the Vuelta. He couldn't repeat his stage victory. Joaquim Rodríguez (), a specialist on very steep hills, won the stage before the surprisingly strong Dutchman Wout Poels () and team-mate Daniel Moreno. Leader Chavanel lost several seconds but managed to keep the lead in the race.\nThe Liquigas team of Vincenzo Nibali rode a strong descent in the final of stage 6 and managed to form a small break-away with four Liquigas riders and former stage winner Lastras. From the four Liquigas riders Peter Sagan took his first Grand-Tour victory. Nibali failed to gain bonification seconds due to miscommunication within the team. The 2010 winner took sixteen seconds on his direct concurrents for the overall victory. The next day Sagan sprinted again for the stage victory but couldn't beat German talent Marcel Kittel () in a sprint which was characterized by a huge crash of American sprinter Tyler Farrar () in which he didn't suffer any serious injuries.\nDoping.\nOn 13 June 2019, the UCI announced that Cobo's biological passport had indicated the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the period between 2009 and 2011. He was therefore considered ineligible for results. Cobo had one month to lodge an appeal against the decision. On 17 July 2019, as the time for Cobo to appeal the decision expired with no application, the UCI announced that it recognised Chris Froome as the 2011 champion. Bradley Wiggins was promoted to second place, and Bauke Mollema promoted to third.\nStandings.\nTeam classification.\nThe UCI disqualified Juan José Cobo and Carlos Barredo from the race. If you ignore them in the daily results, Geox–TMC would drop to 3rd place, Rabobank would end up 13th, and Team RadioShack would be 10th.\nWorld rankings points.\nThe Vuelta was one of 27 events throughout the season that contributed points towards the 2011 UCI World Tour. Points were awarded to the top 20 finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage. Only riders on UCI ProTour teams were eligible to receive rankings points, so winner Juan Cobo was not rewarded in this table."

        "text": "For the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, a total of six sports venues were used. Alpine skiing events took place for the first time and were held in three different locations. Riessersee held the speed skating and some of the ice hockey matches while the bobsleigh events took place south of the lake. The ski jump and its neighboring stadium played host to the cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping events. Even though figure skating and some of the ice hockey matches took place outdoors at the ice stadium, the ice itself was artificially refrigerated to prevent ice thawing.\nBefore the Olympics.\nThe first ski jump in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was constructed in 1902. A permanent structure was completed in 1934 in time for the 1936 Games. Bobsleigh took place in Garmisch as early as 1910. The track used for the 1936 Games was completed in 1934. The first Bobsleigh World Championships that took place at the track was in 1934 in the four-man event. The ice stadium was constructed in only 106 days in 1934. The rink was supported by of steel piping to keep the rink at a consistent temperature. A chiller was used to keep the rink frozen at a consistent temperature.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThe speed skating and some of the ice hockey matches took place at Reissersee near the hotels located on the east side of the lake. In the forest south of the lake was where the bobsleigh track was located. During the men's singles figure skating event, judge John Machado of Canada contracted pneumonia after being outdoors in six hours of inclement weather and had to be replaced.\nAfter the Olympics.\nSince the 1952-53 ski jumping season, the jump has been part of the Four Hills Tournament. It has hosted a ski jumping event every New Year's Day since 1953. The jump was renovated in 1978 before being demolished in April 2007. A new venue was constructed during the rest of that year with it being opened and dedicated for use during the 2007–08 Four Hills Tournament on New Year's Day 2008.\nThe bobsleigh track hosted the FIBT World Championships in 1938 (four-man), 1953, and 1962 before being demolished in 1966.\nThe ice stadium was converted into an indoor arena in 1964, renovated between 1990 and 1994, and is now known as \"Olympia Eissport Zentrum Garmisch-Partenkirchen\" ().\nGarmisch became a popular alpine skiing venue, hosting the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in 1978 and 2011. It was part of Munich's unsuccessful bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics to host all of the skiing events (alpine, cross-country, freestyle, Nordic combined, snowboarding, and ski jumping) for those games should the city that hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics be awarded the games in July 2011."

        "text": "This article lists records for stolen bases within Major League Baseball (MLB). For individual players, leaders in stolen bases for a career, single season, and single game are provided, along with leaders in stolen base percentage for a single season and career. Team records for stolen bases in a single season are also provided.\nStolen bases were not officially noted in a baseball game's summary until 1886, and it was not until 1888 that it officially earned a place in baseball's box score. The modern rule for stolen bases was adopted in 1898. While some sources do not include stolen base records before 1898—because they are difficult to compare to the era after 1898—as the sourcing on the below list indicates, Major League Baseball continues to recognize them.\nIndividual records.\nCareer stolen base leaders.\nSource:\nEntering the 2022 MLB season, only three active players have 300 or more career stolen bases: Dee Strange-Gordon, Elvis Andrus, and Billy Hamilton.\nSingle-season stolen base leaders (100 or more).\nThe pre-modern single-season mark for stolen bases is 138 by Hugh Nicol of the Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA) in 1887. In the modern era, Ty Cobb set a single-season mark of 96 stolen bases in 1915 that lasted until it was broken by Maury Wills with 104 in 1962. A new modern mark was set by Lou Brock with 118 in 1974, and again by Rickey Henderson with 130 in 1982. Henderson and Vince Coleman are the only players to record three 100-steal seasons in the modern era. Coleman is the only player to do it three seasons in a row, much less in the first three season of his career, as well as the only player to record 100 steals as a rookie.\n denotes a player's rookie season\nSingle-game stolen base leaders (5 or more).\nUnder the pre-modern rule, George Gore stole 7 bases in a game in 1881, a mark that was tied by \"Sliding Billy\" Hamilton in 1894. In the modern era, Eddie Collins stole 6 bases in a game on two occasions, both in September 1912, a mark that stood alone for nearly eight decades before being tied by Otis Nixon (1991), Eric Young (1996), and Carl Crawford (2009).\nConsecutive stolen base leaders (35 or more).\nRecords for consecutive successful stolen base attempts are limited by the available data, as times caught stealing has been recorded officially only since 1920. Max Carey established a mark in 1922–23 of 36 consecutive stolen bases without being caught, which stood until it was broken by Davey Lopes with 38 consecutive steals in 1975. Lopes's record was broken by Vince Coleman with 50 consecutive stolen bases in 1988–89.\nMultiple-season stolen base records.\nThree or more seasons with 70 stolen bases.\nUnder pre-modern rules, \"Sliding Billy\" Hamilton amassed six separate seasons of 70-plus stolen bases over his career. In the modern era, Ty Cobb established a mark of three such seasons that stood (though tied by Lou Brock and Omar Moreno) until it was broken by Tim Raines in 1984. In 1986, Raines reached six seasons of 70-plus steals, all consecutive (a record), but Rickey Henderson notched his seventh such season in 1989.\nTen or more seasons with 40 stolen bases.\nIn 1924, Eddie Collins tied Billy Hamilton's pre-modern mark of ten seasons with 40-plus stolen bases. A year later, Max Carey also tied the record. The record was broken by Lou Brock in 1974. Brock eventually recorded a thirteenth 40-steal season, but was in turn surpassed by Rickey Henderson in 1993. Henderson eventually stole 40 bases in sixteen separate seasons.\nStolen base percentage leaders.\nCareer leaders (80% or more, 400+ attempts).\nThose marked in bold have at least 600 career stolen base attempts. Of those, Joe Morgan (in 1984) was the first to retire with a career stolen base percentage of at least 80%. His mark was successively surpassed by Davey Lopes (retired 1987), Willie Wilson (retired 1994), and Tim Raines (retired 2002).\nSingle-season leaders (95% or more, 30+ steals).\nNote: includes all statistics from both leagues for players traded during a season.\nTeam records.\nTables in this section indicate which MLB-recognized league each team played in.\nMost stolen bases by a team in one season, by league.\nWhile not recognized as a major league by MLB, the National Association (NA) operated from 1871 through 1875, with the 1873 Boston Red Stockings amassing the most stolen bases in a single season, 145.\nMost stolen bases by a team in one season (450 or more).\nRecords in this category are dominated by teams of the American Association, which operated from 1882 to 1891, and whose records are recognized by Major League Baseball. In particular, the top four entries in the below table are from the league's 1887 season, when every team in league had at least 305 stolen bases and the league \"average\" was 458 (each team played between 133 and 141 games).\nSource:\nMost stolen bases by a team in one season, 1901–present (300 or more).\nThe below table is restricted to teams that have competed since , the first season of play for the American League.\nSource:\nFewest stolen bases by a team in one season (less than 20).\nNote: this table excludes teams from the shortened season.\nSource:"

        "text": "The UMass Minutemen Ice Hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's college ice hockey program that represents the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The Minutemen are a member of Hockey East. They play at the 8,387-seat William D. Mullins Memorial Center (known as the Mullins Center) in Amherst, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nPond history.\nThe centrally located pond on the UMass campus was once used for multiple purposes. In the winter students and faculty would cut out blocks of ice to use for refrigeration and annual tug-of-war games between sophomores and freshmen were hosted during the spring months. In 1909 the first formal ice hockey team began playing on the pond as well. UMass fielded one of the earliest non-ivy league programs, playing continually until poor weather conditions and a lack of funding caused the team to cease in 1939. The Minutemen were able to return to the ice after the war but couldn't play at home until 1954. \nThe lack of a home venue caused the team to suffer through a stretch where they won only 2 games over a 7-year period. Eventually the pond became usable again and UMass were able to play home games with new head coach Steve Kosakowski. The Minutemen performed decently in his 13 seasons and were among 28 teams to found ECAC Hockey. In 1964 the ECAC split into two divisions and any program that did not possess a dedicated indoor arena was placed in ECAC 2. UMass continued with the second-tier conference for 15 years and achieved their greatest success in 1972 under Jack Canniff, winning the conference tournament title.\nBy the end of the 1970s using the pond as a rink had become untenable and when no alternatives surfaced the program was shuttered.\nReturn to the Ice.\nWhen the Mullins Center opened in 1993 it was designed as a multi-purpose arena and allowed for the university to rekindle its ice hockey program. The men's team started the same year and hit the ice as a Division I independent. With 20 wins in the first season under Joe Mallen, there was hope that the Minutemen could compete in Hockey East. However, once they began a tougher schedule in 1994–95, the team lost a then-school-record 28 games. Though the team rarely finished last in the conference under Mallen, there were very few gains and he was replaced by Don Cahoon in 2000.\nUnder Cahoon the team began to improve, posting a winning season in 2003 and reaching the conference championship game the following year. His greatest success came after recruiting Jonathan Quick, who helped UMass to reach their first ever NCAA tournament in 2007. Cahoon couldn't keep the success going, however, and after being knocked off in five consecutive conference quarterfinals he retired in 2012.\nJohn Micheletto was tabbed as Cahoon's successor and after a decent first season the team slid down the standing and bottomed out for two consecutive seasons. After the second last-place finish Micheletto was fired and replaced by St. Lawrence head coach Greg Carvel.\nGreg Carvel era (2016–present).\nIn Carvel's first season the team reached a nadir; the Minutemen set a new program record for futility, losing 29 games. Carvel led the team to a much-improved finish in his second season and then team took off in year three. The Minutemen reached their first ever Frozen Four and a berth in the 2019 NCAA Division I National Championship in which the Minutemen ultimately lost to Minnesota-Duluth 3–0. Though the year ended on a sour note, the team posted a new program record for wins (31) while Cale Makar won the school's first Hobey Baker Award.\nOn April 10, 2021, the Minutemen won their first-ever NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, beating the St. Cloud State Huskies 5–0.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nCoaches and support staff.\nCurrent as of November, 2018.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer points leaders.\n† - active\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nThe Longest Game.\nOn March 6, 2015, UMass faced Notre Dame in Game 1 of the Opening Round of the 2015 Hockey East Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, played at Compton Family Ice Arena at Notre Dame.

        "title": "Providence Friars men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Providence Friars men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Providence College. The Friars are a member of Hockey East. The skating Friars are currently coached by Nate Leaman has been the head coach of the skating Friars since 2011, leading them to a national championship in 2015. They play at the 3,030-seat Schneider Arena in Providence, Rhode Island.\nHistory.\nSource:\nEarly years.\nProvidence began their ice hockey program in 1927 with a 6–4 win over Springfield. Unfortunately it would be over 25 years before the Friars could get their next win. The inaugural season ended with seven straight losses, utilizing three coaches in total, and due to a lack of available ice the program was shuttered until 1952. When Providence did return to the ice they did so in the Rhode Island Auditorium, and with Providence native Dick Rondeau behind the bench. The results were poor at the start, understandably, but Rondeau did get the Friars to produce a winning season in his third year, coincidentally the same year the Friars played in their first conference, the NEHL.\nRondeau left after 1956 and turned the team over to Tom Eccleston who continued to build the Friar's resume. In 8 seasons Eccleston only had one losing season and when ECAC Hockey was formed in 1961 he had the team well-positioned. Despite a 14th-place finish (out of 28) Providence was selected as one of the 8 teams to participate in the first conference tournament. The Friars shot up the standings the following year, finishing 5th before winning their first conference title in 1964 which they followed up with the Conference Championship. The win sent Providence to the National tournament for the first time but the Friars lost both games to finish a disappointing 4th.\nLamoriello Years.\nEccleston retired from coaching in 1964 and turned the team over to former NHLer Zellio Toppazzini but, after a good first season, the Friars plummeted to the bottom of the conference and remained their for three years before former Friar all-star Lou Lamoriello was installed as head coach. The team began to recover in Lamoriello's second season and made the conference tournament the following year. After a few seasons oscillating up and down the standings Lamoriello recruited Ron Wilson to Providence and the defenseman paid immediate dividends. Wilson won the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year in 1974 and then exploded for 87 points in just 27 games during his sophomore season. Wilson led the entire conference in scoring and finished second in the nation and set an all-time NCAA record for assists (61) and points (87) by a defenseman both overall and per game. While the overall totals have both been surpassed, Wilson still has the records for assists and points per game for a defenseman (as of 2019). Wilson was named the ECAC Hockey Player of the Year but without much help (as evidenced by his contributing on 72.5% of Providence's goals that season) Wilson couldn't get the Friars past the conference quarterfinals in any of his 4 seasons.\nAfter Wilson graduated in 1977, Lamoriello was able to keep the team in the conference playoffs and win their first postseason game since Eccleston and then upset 26–1 Boston University in the semifinal to guarantee the Friars a trip to the 1978 NCAA tournament. When Boston College won the ECAC Championship Providence was given the second eastern seed, however, because BU had such a stellar season the NCAA selection committee gave them an at-large bid. Providence was forced to play the nation's top team a second time to earn a berth in the national semifinal and, with the Terriers looking for revenge, Providence couldn't pull off the upset a second time. Despite the setback success stayed with the Friars and PC made the conference tournament each of the following six seasons. Lamoriello got the team to post its first 20-win season in 1979–80 and followed that up with a surprising tournament championship. Unfortunately the Friars still could not win a tournament game and were swept out by Michigan State in the quarterfinals. After a second 20-win season Lamoriello was promoted to Athletic director in 1982 but remained as coach for another season while he found a suitable replacement. In his final season the Friars demolished the previous program by posting 33 wins, albeit with 9 games more than they had ever played, and finished atop the conference for the second time. Lamoriello's team finished as the conference tournament runner-up and made the NCAA tournament where they finally managed to win a game, sweeping Minnesota–Duluth out of the quarterfinals. Providence was stymied by Wisconsin in the semifinal but the team redeemed itself with a 3rd-place finish.\nHockey East.\nSteve Stirling was introduced as the new coach the following year and kept on rolling with another 20+ win season. In 1984 all 6 teams in the East Division and Lowell left the conference and formed Hockey East. While Providence was mostly a middling team that season, when the playoffs came around, junior goaltender Chris Terreri came into his own. After allowing 2 goals in the two quarterfinal games against Northeastern, Terreri shut down Boston University in the semifinal and led the Friars against Hockey East champion Boston College in the championship. Terreri held one of the nation's top offensive teams to a single goal in his 65-save masterpiece as Providence won in double overtime. Allowing just 5 goals in four and a half games was an astounding effort, especially at a time when most teams were routinely scoring 4 goals per game.\nTerreri continued his MVP performance in the NCAA tournament when the Friars were pitted against Michigan State. The Spartans were the best team all season and entered the tournament having just tied the record for the most wins in a season. In the first game, despite the Spartans potent offense, they only managed to win the game by a single goal, leaving the door open for the Friars in the rematch. Terreri held Michigan State to 2 goals, making 83 saves in the two games, and allowing the 4 his team scored to earn them a trip into the semifinals as one of the biggest upsets in tournament history. In the semifinal Providence met Boston College once more and the two teams battled in a lopsided game. While Terreri was bombarded by shots, BC's Scott Gordon had a much easier time but the teams remained tied after regulation. This time it took three overtime periods and with the Terreri setting an NCAA record for saves in a Frozen Four game (stall a record as of 2019) the Friars won the game and made their first championship appearance. Terreri was again stellar in the final game against Rensselaer, allowing 2 goals on 42 shots, but this time his team couldn't support him offensively and the Friars lost 1–2. Despite the loss, the astounding performance by Terreri (2.14 GAA, .949 sv%) earned him Tournament MOP honors, the only losing player to win the award since 1960.\nMiddling Results.\nAfter the spectacular finish the team suffered a blow when Stirling resigned to return to Division III Babson and he was replaced by Mike McShane. McShane's tenure was neither good nor bad for the Friars as the team finished with a ~.500 record in his nine seasons but early on Providence lost their leading figure when Lou Lamoriello became the team president for the New Jersey Devils. The Friars continued on with McShane leading them to four consecutive 20+ win seasons in the early 1990s but he was eventually replaced by Paul Pooley in 1994. Early on Pooley looked to be the man to lead the Friars, guiding the team to its second Hockey East tournament title in 1996 but the results soon turned and his tenure with Providence ended with 4 straight conference quarterfinal losses.\nAfter Pooley Providence brought back a name from its past, hoping that Tim Army would be able to succeed as Lamoriello one had, but in six seasons Army produced just one winning campaign (his first) and Providence missed out on the playoffs entirely in his final three years.\nReturn to Prominence.\nIn 2011 former Union bench boss Nate Leaman was brought in and the team responded by winning its first playoff round in over a decade. By year two the team had a winning record and in the third season Leaman had led Providence to its first 20+ win year since 2001. In 2015, led by junior goaltender Jon Gillies, Providence won 26 games (the most since 1983) and finished tied for second in Hockey East. Despite this the team was upset in the quarterfinals by New Hampshire and had to wait to see if they could get in on the strength of their record. The Friars did manage to secure of the last at-large berths and opened the tournament against 4th overall seeded Miami. Providence posted an enormous 4-goal second period in their backyard to build a 6–2 lead but the RedHawks came storming back with three extra-attacker goals late in the third. Brandon Tanev ended the comeback bid with an empty-netter to advance Providence to the Regional Final. After the first game jitters Gillies appeared to find his game and limited Denver and Omaha to a single goal each in the next two contests to lead Providence back to the National Championship game. 30 years after their first title tilt it appears that Providence would again lose out but after BU netminder Matt O'Connor dropped the puck into his own net to tie the game the momentum swing in the Friars' direction allowing Tanev to score the game-winning goal just over two minutes later.\nLeaman continues to lead the Friars and had led the program to six consecutive tournament berths winning at least one game in four of those years. Leaman currently sits 3rd all-time in program wins and is #1 in winning percentage (as of 2019).\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nNCAA Division I Ice Hockey Scoring Champion\nTim Taylor Award\nDerek Hines Unsung Hero Award\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-American teams.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nMost Outstanding Player in tournament\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nGoaltending champions\nCoach of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nLen Ceglarski Award\nRookie of the Year\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nThird Team\nRookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Providence alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nProvidence Friars Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Providence men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Providence College Athletic Hall of Fame.\nFriars in the NHL.\nSource:"

The Huskies play home games at the 4,666-seat Matthews Arena, the world's oldest hockey arena still in use. Jerry Keefe assumed the head coach role in 2021 after longtime coach Jim Madigan moved to athletic director.\nHistory.\nThe men's ice hockey program has existed since 1929 and played as an independent NCAA Division I team until joining the ECAC in 1961. Northeastern is a founding member of the Hockey East athletic conference, which the team joined in 1984. The Huskies had their most success in the 1980s, when the team won the prestigious Beanpot tournament four times (1980, 1984, 1985, 1988) and was the runner-up twice (1983 and 1987). The Huskies ended a 30-year Beanpot drought in 2018, followed by further wins in 2019, 2020, 2023, and 2024 for a total of nine championships.\nIts best season came in 1982, when the Huskies finished 25–9–2 and made it to the NCAA Frozen Four.

        "text": "The Merrimack Warriors men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Merrimack College. The Warriors are a member of Hockey East. They play at the 2,549-seat J. Thom Lawler Rink in North Andover, Massachusetts, which underwent renovation in 2010. Merrimack's 92.08% capacity during the 2013–14 season was second in Hockey East.\nHistory.\nThe Warriors started intercollegiate play in 1954–55, as the college offered more support to the program in the form of a modest budget, new uniforms and varsity letters. Babson, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Keene Teachers were among the first intercollegiate competition Merrimack hockey faced that year. And for the first time, the college recognized hockey as a varsity sport.\nThey were successful in the late 1970s and early 1980s while playing in the ECAC Division II. Merrimack won the division II national title in 1978 and were the runner up in 1984. They became an NCAA Division I independent team in 1984 but did not play a schedule against predominantly Division I teams until they joined the Hockey East conference in 1989.\nLed by Coach Ron Anderson, a new era began for Merrimack hockey in 1989 when the Warriors competed in their first season as a member of the Hockey East Association. That team posted an overall record of 10–24–1, but pulled off the surprise of the season by taking eventual league champion Boston College to a third and decisive playoff game. And after being picked for the bottom part of the league in three of the last four seasons, the Warriors continued to baffle the experts by battling for home-ice advantage all season long while defeating several Top 20 teams. And with the roots of the Merrimack hockey tree that were planted in Hockey East seven years earlier firmly entrenched, the 1996–97 Warriors entered a new chapter in history by qualifying for a Hockey East playoff home ice berth. The 1997–98 team raised the bar a little higher by upsetting top-ranked Boston University in the quarterfinals and earning a trip to the conference semifinals at Boston's FleetCenter.\nThe 1998–99 season began yet another era in Merrimack hockey history with the dawning of the Serino age. On April 24, 1998, Chris Serino became just the sixth head coach in the program's history. The Warriors posted a mark of 11–24–1 in Serino's inaugural campaign, and senior forward and captain Rejean Stringer was named an All-American, Merrimack's first ever in the University Division. In Serino's second season, the Warriors set an NCAA record for consecutive overtime contests by playing in six straight at the end of January, and in 2000–01, the Warriors notched 14 victories, the most for Merrimack since 1996–97. Several of those victories were over nationally ranked opponents.\nIn 2002–03, senior goaltender and captain Joe Exter led Merrimack to a surprising race for home ice throughout much of the season, including the team's first-ever regular season Division I tournament title with wins over host Rensselaer and Wayne State at the 52nd Annual Rensselaer/HSBC Holiday Hockey Tournament in late December. Exter was selected to the All-Hockey East Team by league coaches. Long-time assistant coach Stu Irving was also honored, as the American Hockey Coaches Association presented him with its Terry Flanagan Memorial Award in recognition of an assistant coach's career body of work. The season also saw the inauguration of the Blue Line Club, the program's official support organization.\nThe program struggled in the highly competitive Hockey East. The 2006–07 season, in which they won only 3 games, was the nadir of their struggles. In the 2010–11 season, however, they had unprecedented success against several of the nation's top teams. They finished the regular season 22–8–4 and were ranked 9th in the nation. Merrimack gained a home ice advantage for the first round for the first time since 1997.\nThe program received its first No. 1 ranking in the USCHO Poll during the 2011–12 season.\nMark Dennehy was fired as the team's head coach at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season following a 12–21–4 record and a sixth straight losing season.

The main feature of the year was the National Provincial Championship competition that was run by the New Zealand Rugby League. Canterbury won the Championship by defeating Auckland 36–12 in the Final.\nInternational competitions.\nThe New Zealand national rugby league team drew 14-all with the Kangaroos at Mt Smart Stadium. This was the first ever draw between the two countries. They then lost 8–16 at the Palmerston North Showgrounds before finishing the test series by going down 4–16 in Brisbane.\nThe New Zealand squad was: Morvin Edwards, Sean Hoppe, Jarrod McCracken, Dave Watson, Daryl Halligan, Tea Ropati, Gary Freeman (C), Se'e Solomona, Duane Mann, Brent Todd, Gary Mercer, Quentin Pongia, Tawera Nikau, Tony Kemp, Brendon Tuuta, Jason Donnelly, Stephen Kearney, Gavin Hill and John Lomax while Howie Tamati was the coach and Richard Bolton was the manager.\nNew Zealand then toured Great Britain and France, beating Wales, Wigan, St Helens, Widnes, Leeds, France and the Great Britain under 23's but losing to Bradford Northern, Castleford and all three tests against Great Britain.

Georgia Southern University does not have a men's team.\nProgram history.\nBeginning in 1985, the Georgia Southern Volleyball program has been guided by a total of eight coaches. In years 2001, and 2003 the team was named Southern Conference Tournament Champions. This accomplishment took the team to the NCAA Tournament where they competed to earn a championship title. As of 2009 the overall record of the program was 353 wins, followed by 430 losses. Coming into the 2010 season, the team lost a total of 5 players: two freshmen, one junior, and one graduated senior. In return the team gained a total of four newcomers: three freshmen, and one junior.\nHanner Fieldhouse.\nHanner Fieldhouse was completed in 1969, and became a home to Georgia Southern's athletic programs. This facility is where the Volleyball team competes. The complex is named after W.S. Hanner, who was a past athletic chairman in the years 1935, through 1959. Also taking part in coaching tennis and football, Hanner served as a professor in the branch of Exercise Science. Hanner Fieldhouse not only houses athletic teams, but also is a home to \"Health, Physical Education and Professional Studies.\" The Hanner Fieldhouse contains a large gym (capacity of 4,358), a small gym, athletic training room, team locker rooms, coach's offices, and a weight room.\n2010 Season.\nThe Lady Eagles started off with an early pre-season record of 8-6, playing teams such as Duke University, University of Miami, and Auburn University. At the start of conference play the Eagles then went on a 4 match winning streak, slowly to be ended to the College of Charleston. In response the team then came back and won 10 straight games, 5 of them being home games, and 9 being conference games. Within this winning streak the team had a chance to travel to Jacksonville to play North Florida for the ninth straight win. The team also had a home victory over Furman University, coming back in the game to defeat the Paladins in a five-game thriller. Despite the winning streak the College of Charleston once again took the victory away from the Eagles in Hanner Fieldhouse on November 6, and ended the home winning streak of 12 straight matches. This put the team ending the regular conference season at a record of 15-2, earning the second seed in the South Division. This brought them to the Southern Conference Tournament held at Appalachian State, in Boone, North Carolina. The Eagles started the first round of the Southern Conference Tournament with playing Appalachian State. Soon to take a victory and continue to the semi-final round the team then was set out to play Elon University. The Eagles defeated Elon and were headed to the final round of the Southern Conference Tournament to play the College of Charleston Cougars, who has given the Eagles their only regular season losses. The team swept the Cougars in the finals and were then named Southern Conference Champions of the 2010 season."

        "text": "John Kay (12 January 1910 – 16 February 1999) was a British cricket correspondent for the \"Manchester Evening News\" from the end of the Second World War to 1975 and for the \"Brighton Argus\". He toured Australia for the 1950-51 Ashes series for the \"Manchester Evening News\" and wrote several cricketing books, including \"Ashes to Hassett\" (1951) and \"Cricket in the Leagues\" (1970). \nKay played for Middleton in the Central Lancashire League. When Basil d'Oliveira emigrated from South Africa in 1960 because Apartheid banned him from playing first-class cricket, Kay arranged for him to play for Middleton as a professional. He wrote that d'Oliveira was surprised to see white people serving him in restaurants and doing menial work. D'Oliveira later played for Worcestershire (from 1964) and England (from 1966).\nKay's prose style was colourful and he could be critical, as evidenced by these two examples from \"Ashes to Hassett\":\nAll Australia honoured Hutton as the world's best batsman, and never did a man play harder or more successfully on his country's behalf…One man cannot make a cricket team, but Len Hutton did the next best thing in Australia last winter. He stood alone. Superb in craftsmanship, magnificent in the hour of stress, veritably a giant among all batsmen and worthy of ranking with such famous names as Hobbs, Sutcliffe, Woolley, Hammond ... they were masters of all they surveyed. So was Hutton.\nThe First Test between Australia and England is played nowadays at Brisbane. Nobody seems to know why, and all sorts of arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the Woolloongabba ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt ... The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down ... at Brisbane only a Hutton could stay, let alone score runs."

        "text": "John Moir (May 22, 1915 – November 15, 1975) was a professional basketball player between 1938 and 1946 in the United States' National Basketball League.\nEarly life.\nMoir was born in Rutherglen, Scotland, to parents John and Elizabeth Moir. His father was a carpenter by trade, and Moir also had two siblings. In 1923, their family immigrated to the United States and chose to live in Niagara Falls, New York. As a freshman at Niagara Falls High School, Moir stood only tall. When he graduated from NFHS he enrolled at Trott Vocational School, at which point he had finished growing to and 184 lbs. It was at Trott where Moir first played basketball. When he finished his vocational education, Moir got a job at American Sales Book Company as their bookkeeper. He played on the company's industrial league basketball team, but it was actually his job performance that afforded him the opportunity to attend college.\nCollege.\nMoir decided to enroll at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Back then, NCAA rules prohibited freshmen from playing varsity sports, so it was not until Moir's sophomore year of 1935–36 that he was able to play basketball for coach George Keogan.\nDespite having not played basketball until the interim period between high school graduation and college, Moir led the Fighting Irish to a 22–2–1 record and the Helms Athletic Foundation NCAA National Championship in his first season of eligibility. He played the forward position and led the team in scoring at 11.3 points per game (ppg). Moir was also named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year. Over the next two seasons, he led the team in scoring at 13.2 and 10.5 ppg, respectively, while also being named a consensus All-America selection in each of his three years playing for Notre Dame. Moir had broken every single school scoring record that Edward \"Moose\" Krause had set during his three-time All-American career earlier that decade.\nProfessional.\nAfter graduating from Notre Dame, Moir played professionally in the National Basketball League. In his first two seasons in the league, he won two NBL championships as a member of the Akron Firestone Non-Skids in 1938–39 and 1939–40. Over the course of those two championship seasons Moir averaged 7 ppg, and in the 1940 playoffs he led all players with an 11 ppg average. He spent one more season playing for Akron before joining the Rochester Seagrams in 1942. However, World War II suspended Rochester's ability to play.\nWhen Moir resumed play in 1945–46, he joined the Cleveland Allmen Transfers for whom he played his final season. When his NBL career ended, he had played for four years, won two league championships and scored 562 points in 89 total games.\nLater life.\nIn his post-basketball life, Moir lived in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and worked for the Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company. He and his wife Marjorie raised two daughters and one son."

        "title": "Gopichand Badminton Academy",
        "text": " Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) is a badminton training facility in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Founded in 2008 by the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion, Pullela Gopichand, the facility trains several badminton players such as Saina Nehwal, P. V. Sindhu, Srikanth Kidambi, Parupalli Kashyap, H.S. Prannoy, Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma and many others.\nHistory.\nBy the time he won the All England Open Badminton Championships in 2001, Gopichand was already 27 years old and struggling with a few injuries. With not many playing years left, Gopichand decided to bring a world-class training facility for the next generation. With that intention, Gopichand decided to form a badminton academy. Soon after his well-recognized win in England, the Government of Andhra Pradesh under the leadership of Nara Chandrababu Naidu awarded him of land in 2003. The land in Hyderabad's Gachibowli area was offered as a lease at a very nominal rate for 45 years. At the same time, he started talks with Yonex for sponsorship and also wanted to involve a foreign coach.\nIn the following year, Gopichand formulated his plans for the academy and approached Nimmagadda Prasad, a distant relative and a serial entrepreneur, to raise money for this venture. At that time, Prasad sold Matrix Laboratories, a pharmaceutical manufacturing company, to an American pharma company, Mylan Inc. Since Prasad was convinced about Gopichand's idea, he immediately offered US$500,000 and his assistance in raising an additional amount of US$2 million. With cricket being a more popular sport, Gopichand and Prasad found it hard to raise additional money from other sources. Over time, Prasad increased his contribution to US$1.25 million. Gopichand's wife and former Olympian, P. V. V. Lakshmi, was very supportive of him and even contributed to the effort of securing monetary support. Despite other donations, Gopichand could only gather US$1.75 million. It was then he decided to mortgage his family home and raise the remaining money for the already delayed project. In 2008, the facility was eventually completed at the cost of US$2.5 million.\nImmediately after the construction, the Government of India sent the Commonwealth Games team to train at this facility. The government increased the daily rate they pay per player to US$20 for this special Games camp. This was a big jump from the US$5 daily fee per player that the government had previously paid for other training camps.\nIn 2008, Gopichand appealed to Bollywood, the Hindi cinema industry to become badminton's brand ambassador. He felt that by having a popular cinema icon supporting the sport will help popularize it.\nDespite Saina Nehwal's success in international tournaments, Gopichand found it hard to run the Academy. To run it at an optimal level, it requires US$300,000 a year. As of 2010, he was making do with US$100,000 to pay the training cost for 60 players and was holding off hiring more coaches.\nFacilities.\nAfter construction, the US$2.5 million badminton training academy contains eight courts, a swimming pool, weight training room, cafeteria and rooms to sleep. The construction of this facility was modeled after Bangalore's Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy, which is headed by Prakash Padukone. The architectural design was completed by Hyderabad-based Arvee Consultants. The wooden flooring of the courts were made as per international standards. In addition, physiotherapy, food and diet programs are also available. The second such facility is opened at the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex, Greater Noida. They have recently started their unit in Salem, Tamil Nadu. There are already academies at the Gwalior, Vadodara and Hyderabad.\nTournament center.\nThe Academy has also served as a venue for major sporting events. The 2009 Indian Open was held here while the 2009 BWF World Championships used it as a training venue."

        "title": "WrestleMania XXVIII",
        "text": "WrestleMania XXVIII was the 28th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on April 1, 2012, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\nThere were eight matches on the event's card and one pre-show match that was streamed on YouTube. The main event saw The Rock defeat John Cena and was advertised a year in advance, being set up in the main event of the previous year's WrestleMania XXVII. In other prominent matches, The Undertaker defeated Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match with Shawn Michaels serving as the special guest referee, CM Punk defeated Chris Jericho to retain the WWE Championship, Big Show defeated Cody Rhodes to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship, and in the opening bout, Sheamus defeated Daniel Bryan to win the World Heavyweight Championship in an 18 second match.\nThe Rock vs. John Cena match was re-broadcast on August 25, 2012, on NBC and later issued on DVD and Blu-ray, collected under the title of \"The Rock vs John Cena: Once in a Lifetime\". The match was later included in \"WWE Best PPV Matches of 2012\" as the \"Most Anticipated WrestleMania Match of All Time\". Despite the \"Once in a Lifetime\" tagline, the two would wrestle each other again at WrestleMania 29 in the main event for the WWE Championship, with Cena emerging victorious and winning the title from the Rock.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985—in April 2011, the promotion ceased going by its full name of World Wrestling Entertainment, with the \"WWE\" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania XXVIII was the first WrestleMania to occur following the end of the first brand extension in August 2011.\nThe city of Miami Gardens, Florida was one of the two major contenders to host WrestleMania XXVII along with Atlanta; in February 2010, Atlanta was awarded the right to host the event. According to the Miami-Dade Sports Commission, WWE management felt that Miami's planning for the event would have been too hectic with many other sporting events held in the area around the same time of the planning, such as Super Bowl XLIV. However, the Miami area was reportedly considered for the next event due to its international ties, facilities, airports, and experience of hosting previous major events.\nBidding documents were sent to seventeen cities in consideration for hosting a WrestleMania event between 2012 and 2014, with fourteen replying in interest. Other cities under consideration for WrestleMania XXVIII included Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Toronto, Detroit, Tampa, Vancouver, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Orlando, and Houston. The city of Dallas also showed interest, but had to withdraw from bidding for the next two years due to hosting events such as the NCAA Final Four.\nMiami was revealed as the site of WrestleMania on February 9, 2011, by \"The Miami Herald\" and at a WWE press conference at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. The event was scheduled to be held on April 1, 2012, at Miami Gardens' Sun Life Stadium. WrestleMania XXVIII was the second WrestleMania event that was hosted in the state of Florida, the fourth open-air event, and the third event to be held entirely outdoors. For hosting the event, WWE received a $250,000 cash incentive from the Miami-Dade Sports Commission raised through grants and sponsorships. Along with WrestleMania XXVIII, a series of events grouped as \"WrestleMania Week\" was held in the week preceding the event including WrestleMania's annual \"WrestleMania Axxess\" fan convention at the Miami Beach Convention Center, the 2012 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the American Airlines Arena, the finals of the WrestleMania Reading Challenge, and a Celebrity Pro-Am Golf tournament.\nStorylines.\nThe event included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, in which wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nThe main event of WrestleMania XXVIII pitted The Rock wrestling against John Cena, billed as a Once in a Lifetime, face of the company generational match. On the February 14, 2011, episode of \"Raw\", The Rock was revealed as the host of WrestleMania XXVII, and upon his return to WWE, began a feud with John Cena (and Cena's opponent at that WrestleMania, then-WWE Champion, The Miz), which continued for weeks in terms of verbal insults, until the March 28 episode of \"Raw\", where Cena delivered the Attitude Adjustment to The Rock after he fended off attacks from the Miz and his protégé, Alex Riley. At WrestleMania XXVII, The Rock got involved in the main event WWE Championship match between Miz and Cena, which initially ended in a double count-out. After the match was restarted under no disqualifications, no count-outs rules, The Rock delivered a Rock Bottom to Cena as a measure of payback, thus enabling the Miz to win the match. The next night on \"Raw\", Cena challenged The Rock to a one-on-one match; Rock accepted and proposed that it be held at WrestleMania XXVIII. After winning the championship from Miz at Extreme Rules, Cena interrupted The Rock's birthday celebrations during the May 2 episode of \"Raw\" to announce his intention to defend the WWE Championship against The Rock at WrestleMania XXVIII. Such intentions were however thwarted by Cena losing the title at Money in the Bank in July. At Survivor Series in November, Cena teamed with The Rock (who wrestled his first WWE match in almost eight years, last competing at WrestleMania XX in 2004). Billed as \"the most charismatic tag team\", they defeated the Miz and R-Truth. After the match, Rock performed a Rock Bottom to Cena.\nAnother match billed as the \"end of an era\", saw The Undertaker face Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match. The previous year at WrestleMania XXVII, in a No Holds Barred match, The Undertaker defeated Triple H via submission, in their second encounter at a WrestleMania (the first being at WrestleMania X-Seven in 2001, where The Undertaker won as well). However, in the post-match events, due to the harsh physicality suffered during the bout, The Undertaker, for the first time in his career, was carted away from the Georgia Dome by the medical staff on a stretcher. After a near ten-month long hiatus, The Undertaker returned on the January 30, 2012, episode of \"Raw\", confronting and challenging Triple H to a rematch at WrestleMania XXVIII. The Undertaker, having been dissatisfied of his post-WrestleMania match scenario the previous year, stated that he \"did not want 'that scene' to be a lasting memory\" of him and was willing to give Triple H \"another chance at immortality\". After Triple H refused to accept the challenge the next week his close friend and WWE Hall of Famer, Shawn Michaels appeared on the February 13 episode to instigate him in accepting The Undertaker's challenge, which was in vain as Triple H stated he was willing to put his ego and personal agendas aside for the future of WWE, and viewed The Undertaker's 19–0 undefeated WrestleMania streak as a \"brand\" to cash-in for the company, finally ending the argument saying he would not be the one to end it. Then, on the February 20 episode, The Undertaker still remained adamant in getting a WrestleMania rematch with Triple H, going so far as to label Triple H as a \"coward\", and comparing his abilities and career to that of Shawn Michaels. Enraged by these comments, Triple H finally accepted The Undertaker's challenge at WrestleMania XXVIII, saying that if \"he [Undertaker] wanted an end, they would go all the way\", and proposed that they would compete in a Hell in a Cell match. On the March 5 episode, Michaels confronted Triple H again; Michaels expressed his views on who was better than the other, predicted Triple H's chances of defeating The Undertaker, and revealed himself as the special guest referee in their Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania.\nOn July 17, 2011, at the Money in the Bank event, Daniel Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. On the July 22 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan declared his intentions of cashing-in his Money in the Bank contract at WrestleMania XXVIII. However, he apparently cashed-in his contract briefcase on the November 25 episode of \"SmackDown\" and pinned the reigning World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry to supposedly win the title and began to celebrate, but SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long informed Bryan that Henry was not medically cleared to compete, and declared the match void, thereby returning the briefcase to Bryan and the title back to Henry. The next week on \"Raw\", Bryan acknowledged that he went back on his word, saying that headlining WrestleMania \"was\" his dream and that his \"plans changed\"; that the briefcase \"doesn't guarantee [him] anything\", since he could be put out of action at any time. WWE continued to maintain the advertisement for WrestleMania, until Bryan successfully cashed in his Money in the Bank contract briefcase on Big Show at the event on December 18, 2011, to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. In January 2012, at the twenty-fifth annual Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Sheamus won the thirty-man Royal Rumble match, giving him the right to challenge either the WWE Champion or the World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania XXVIII. At Elimination Chamber in February, Sheamus attacked Bryan, after the latter successfully retained his World Heavyweight Championship in an Elimination Chamber match, thus challenging Bryan for his title at WrestleMania.\nIn another match, CM Punk defended the WWE Championship against Chris Jericho. Since the summer of 2011, Punk had successfully defended the WWE Championship numerous times, calling himself the \"best wrestler in the world\". On the January 2, 2012, episode of \"Raw\", after extensive hype through several viral vignettes proclaiming the \"end of the world as we know it\" on that day, Chris Jericho returned to WWE after over a year, and established a villainous persona over the next several weeks. On the February 13 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho accused Punk in an in-ring segment of being a copycat of him, and that Punk stole his proclamation of being the \"best in the world\". While competing in the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Jericho was knocked out by a kick to the head by Punk, rendering him unable to compete any further, and Punk went on to win that match and retain the title. This incident further fueled Jericho's animosity towards Punk. On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho won a ten-man battle royal to determine the number-one contender to face Punk for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII. In subsequent promos, both wrestlers expressed their desire to prove who is \"the best in the world\".\nAnother title match scheduled was for the Intercontinental Championship between defending champion Cody Rhodes and Big Show. Their feud gained increased momentum week after week when, over January and February 2012, Rhodes began mocking Big Show's less than stellar performances at WrestleMania over the years, calling him \"a reverse Undertaker\" (a direct reference to The Undertaker's undefeated 19–0 record at WrestleMania, compared to Big Show's 3–8 record), in addition to citing the \"ridiculous nature\" of some of his matches, such as his Sumo match against Akebono at WrestleMania 21 in 2005 and a No Disqualification match against Floyd Mayweather Jr. at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008, both of which Big Show lost. Rhodes also cost Big Show a chance at the World Heavyweight Championship, by eliminating him from the Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view in February, and a shot at the WWE Championship at WrestleMania, when he pulled Big Show over the top rope, aiding in his elimination by Chris Jericho in the end of a number-one contender's battle royal on the February 20 episode of \"Raw\". On the March 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a match between Rhodes and Big Show for the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII, where the latter has vowed \"to win at all costs.\"\nAt the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view in February 2012, John Laurinaitis, WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent Relations and Interim Raw General Manager, expressed his desire to become the permanent general manager of both Raw and SmackDown. Alberto Del Rio, Mark Henry, and Christian all came out and voiced their support for Laurinaitis over SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long, who later that night put forth his own claim to run both shows. On the February 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", the two General Managers got into an argument following a match between WWE Champion CM Punk and World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan that ended in a draw. The two were then given the chance by the WWE Board of Directors to run the other show for one night in order for the Board to evaluate them, with Long running the March 5 episode of \"Raw\" and Laurinaitis in charge of the March 9 episode of \"SmackDown\". But being still not convinced of either man's decision-making, on March 12, the Board of Directors scheduled a 12-man tag team match for WrestleMania XXVIII, with the stipulation that the General Manager of the winning team being awarded stewardship of both Raw and SmackDown. The same night on \"Raw\", Long appointed his assistant, Santino Marella to be the captain of his team, while Laurinaitis appointed his legal counsel, David Otunga to be his team's captain, naming Mark Henry as the first member of his team. Over the following weeks, R-Truth, Kofi Kingston, Zack Ryder, The Great Khali, and Booker T were added to Team Teddy, with Hornswoggle serving as the team's mascot, while Christian, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, and The Miz joined Team Johnny. Christian, who had joined the team in return for Laurinaitis promising him a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship after WrestleMania, was forced to leave the team due to being (kayfabe) injured by CM Punk on the March 26 episode of \"Raw\" (the real reason being Christian not having fully recovered from his real-life ankle injury) and was replaced by Drew McIntyre.\nAnother match scheduled for WrestleMania was between Divas Beth Phoenix and Eve Torres taking on the team of Kelly Kelly and \"Extra\" co-host Maria Menounos. The feud between Phoenix and Menounos began on the October 12, 2009, episode of \"Raw\" when Menounos accompanied then-\"Access Hollywood\" host Nancy O'Dell, who was the guest host of \"Raw\" that night. Phoenix, angered over having been traded to the SmackDown brand by O'Dell, barged into their office and got into a confrontation with both women, leading to a Six-Diva tag team match later that night in which Menounos' team defeated Phoenix's team. On the 2011 edition of Tribute to the Troops, Menounos made an appearance, this time in an Eight-Diva tag team match, winning the match for her team by pinning Phoenix. Kelly and Eve, on the other hand, had a falling apart of their friendship after Eve turned villainous and admitted to having used Zack Ryder and John Cena to further her own career. On the March 15 episode of \"Extra\", Phoenix and Eve interrupted an interview between Kelly and Menounos, which resulted in a confrontation. Phoenix would then challenge Menounos to a match at WrestleMania, which the latter accepted. Later that night, WWE officials sanctioned a tag team match pitting Phoenix and Eve against Menounos and Kelly for WrestleMania XXVIII.\nAnother rivalry heading into WrestleMania was between Randy Orton and Kane. On the March 2 episode of SmackDown, Kane interrupted Orton's match against Daniel Bryan, causing Orton to lose via count-out. The two men ensued in a brawl, which ended with Kane performing a chokeslam on Orton to \"welcome [Orton] back\" from being injured at the hands of Bryan a few weeks ago. Orton retaliated on the March 5 episode of Raw, by delivering an RKO to Kane after Kane's match. On the March 9 episode of \"SmackDown\", Orton and Kane once again brawled at the end of the show with no man appearing to gain an advantage. The next week on \"SmackDown\", when Orton demanded Kane to explain the root cause of his attacks on him, the latter referred to his handshake with Orton after a Street Fight on the July 22, 2011 episode of SmackDown, in which Orton had defeated him. Kane, explaining that the handshake made him look weak and \"human\", that this \"wretched\" self was now gone, and now wanted to eliminate that memory, challenging Orton at WrestleMania XXVIII.\nOn March 30, a triple threat tag team match for the Tag Team Championship was scheduled between the defending champions Primo and Epico, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and the newly formed team of Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd. This match would be streamed online free before the pay-per-view on both WWE.com and the official WWE YouTube channel.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nA non-televised triple threat tag team match for the Tag Team Championship pitted champions Primo and Epico, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd against each other. The match began with multiple aerial tactics and many pin attempts. In the midst of the match, Justin Gabriel botched a dive outside resulting in an elbow injury. The match ended when Epico hit Jey Uso with a \"Backstabber\" and pinned him to retain the titles.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first televised match, Daniel Bryan defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Sheamus. After receiving a good luck kiss from his (kayfabe) girlfriend AJ Lee, Bryan was surprised by Sheamus, who delivered a Brogue Kick and pinned him to win the title. Lasting only 18 seconds, this was one of the shortest title matches in WWE history.\nIn the second match, Randy Orton faced Kane. After trading moves back and forth, Orton gained the upper hand until Kane made a comeback. Kane continued to dominate the match until Orton kicked out of a chokeslam. Orton gained back momentum but after attempting an \"RKO\" from the second rope, Kane delivered a Chokeslam off the second rope and pinned him to win the match.\nNext, the Intercontinental Championship was on the line between champion Cody Rhodes and Big Show. Rhodes attempted to avoid his opponent until Big Show caught him and tossed him back inside. Big Show dominated from there with vicious attacks. Rhodes managed to deliver a disaster kick. As he went for another one, he took a spear mid-air to the groin from Big Show. Big Show knocked out Rhodes with a \"Knockout Punch\" and pinned him to win his first Intercontinental Championship.\nA tag team match pitted Kelly Kelly and \"Extra\" correspondent Maria Menounos against Divas Champion Beth Phoenix and Eve. Kelly began to get the upper hand over Eve. Kelly tagged in Menounos who got off to a good start but was slowed down by interference from Phoenix. Phoenix and Eve would continue to wear down Menounos who had already suffered two cracked ribs prior to the event. Menounos eventually tagged in Kelly who began to dominate. Phoenix managed to wear down Kelly but Kelly countered a \"Glam Slam\" with a bulldog and tagged in Menounos. The climax of the match came when Kelly saved Menounos, knocked Phoenix into Eve on the apron, and Menounos rolled up Phoenix for the win.\nJim Ross joined the commentators (Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler) for the Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and The Undertaker with Shawn Michaels as special guest referee billed as \"The End of an Era\". The match started with the two going back and forth. The match moved to the outside where The Undertaker dominated. Back in the ring, Triple H assaulted Undertaker with the steel steps and even countered a \"Hell's Gate\". The match intensified when Triple H brought steel chairs and a sledgehammer into the ring. After multiple big moves and weapon shots on each other, the two men repeatedly kicked out. After suffering a \"Pedigree\", a \"Sweet Chin Music\", and multiple chair and sledgehammer shots, Undertaker came back and executed a \"Tombstone Piledriver\"; however, Triple H kicked out. Triple H delivered one more \"Pedigree\" before The Undertaker kicked out, took back control, performed another \"Tombstone\", and won the match to extend his undefeated streak to 20–0. After the match, Undertaker and Michaels helped Triple H out of the ring and made it to the entrance stage, where they embraced.\nThe following match was a twelve-man tag team match to determine who would run both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", pitting teams representing Teddy Long and John Laurinaitis against each other. The match began with a back-and-forth between both teams. After Booker T (of Team Teddy) entered he was worn down by most of Team Johnny until the rest of both teams engaged in an all-out brawl both inside and outside of the ring. Then, Zack Ryder (of Team Teddy) started to dominate Team Johnny's Dolph Ziggler and The Miz, but as he was distracted by his storyline girlfriend Eve, The Miz delivered a \"Skull Crushing Finale\" to Ryder and scored a pinfall victory for Team Johnny, giving John Laurinaitis control of both shows.\nThe penultimate match saw CM Punk defend the WWE Championship against Chris Jericho. However, John Laurinaitis told Punk backstage before the match that if Punk were to get disqualified, he would lose the title. Jericho immediately started attacking Punk. Jericho taunted and slapped Punk, trying to provoke him into getting Punk disqualified. Jericho grabbed a chair and attempted to hit him but Punk quickly cleared the chair and continued on with the match. Punk then successfully connected the GTS, only for a near fall. Punk then applied the \"Anaconda Vise\", forcing Jericho to crawl through and was able to tip the rope. Punk missed the Turnbuckle Shining Wizard, which Jericho countered with a roll-up for a near fall. Jericho caught by Punk with a dropkick, then Punk prepared for a GTS, which Jericho noticed and he fled to the outside of the ring. The match began as Jericho was able to apply several Clothesline, followed by a seated dropkick. Jericho went for his signature submission, Walls of Jericho, but Punk countered. Punk missed the running knee as Jericho hit him with an unexpected 'Codebreaker' for a near fall. At the match's climax, Punk won the match by reversing Jericho's \"Walls of Jericho\" into the \"Anaconda Vise\", forcing Jericho to submit.\nIn a filler segment, Brodus Clay came out with his background dancers, Cameron and Naomi, followed by a group of dancers. Clay then presumably called his \"momma\", after which, Clay's \"momma\" came out and started dancing with rest of the other dancers.\nMain event.\nThe main event pitted John Cena and The Rock in a match billed \"Once In A Lifetime\". Cena and Rock viciously went back-and-forth with each other throughout the match. During the course of the match, The Rock kicked out of two \"Attitude Adjustments\", Cena out of a \"Rock Bottom\" and \"People's Elbow\". When Cena attempted a \"People's Elbow\" on The Rock, throwing his sweatband in the crowd in similar fashion to Rock, he ran into another \"Rock Bottom\" from the Rock, which allowed The Rock to pin Cena and pick up the win.\nReception.\nWrestleMania XXVIII received generally positive critical reception, with praise going to The Rock vs. John Cena, the WWE Championship match between CM Punk and Chris Jericho, and the match between The Undertaker and Triple H. However, the World Heavyweight Championship match between Daniel Bryan and Sheamus was heavily criticized for its short length and perceived burial of Bryan.\nEric Larnick of \"The Huffington Post\" praised the main event match giving it a verdict of good; he applauded Dwayne Johnson, opining that he worked \"his butt off to prove that he can still go in the squared circle\". The post also praised the WWE Championship and Hell in a Cell matches, ranking them alongside the main event. \"IGN\" called Daniel Bryan vs Sheamus the \"worst match of the night\" and The Undertaker vs. Triple H the \"match of the night\". They also applauded the main event match, calling the unexpected outcome a good way for the crowd to go home happy. Wrestling-Edge rated all the matches on a scale of 5 and gave a full 5 star ratings to The Undertaker vs. Triple H Hell in a Cell match.\n\"The Baltimore Sun\"s Adam Testa led with a headline that WrestleMania XXVIII was unable to live up to the hype, while the main event did. He labeled the match as being the match that could break or make the WrestleMania and ended in \"an amazing sequence\". The Rock's victory was again stated as shocking and welcome, leaving people curious about the aftermath of the event. Yahoo's A. Orien Avery found The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan from WrestleMania X8 as the only comparable match from previous WrestleManias, though according to him The Rock being in his prime would make the match more symbolic.\nWrestleMania XXVIII garnered 1,300,000 buys, making it the most purchased wrestling event in history, surpassing WrestleMania 23's buyrate of approximately 1.2 million, with global gross sales in excess of $67 million. The event also set a new record for the highest grossing live event in WWE history, grossing $8.9 million.\nThe Undertaker vs. Triple H Hell in a Cell match won the 2012 Slammy Award for the match of the year as well as being voted the match of the year on Pro Wrestling Illustrated. It has since been regarded as one of the greatest Hell in a Cell matches of all time, as well as one of the best matches in professional wrestling history.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", John Cena talked about his loss to The Rock. He asked for The Rock to come out so that he could offer his congratulations. Instead, Brock Lesnar, in his first appearance since WrestleMania XX in 2004, appeared and laid out Cena with an F-5. The following week, a match between Cena and Lesnar was scheduled for Extreme Rules, which was later changed to an Extreme Rules match. At the event, Cena defeated Lesnar.\nOn the April 10 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was announced that a two out of three falls match between Daniel Bryan and Sheamus for the World Heavyweight Championship would take place at Extreme Rules. At the event, Sheamus defeated Bryan to retain the title and end the feud.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Randy Orton and Kane faced each other again, this time in a No Disqualification match, which Orton won. A Falls Count Anywhere match between the two was later scheduled for Extreme Rules, which Orton won to end the feud.\nA tables match between Big Show and Cody Rhodes was scheduled for Extreme Rules, where Rhodes defeated Show to reclaim the title.\nAlso, a Chicago Street Fight between CM Punk and Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship was scheduled for Extreme Rules, where Punk retained the title.\nAt the 2013 Royal Rumble, John Cena won the Royal Rumble match to earn himself a world title match at WrestleMania 29. Later that night, The Rock defeated CM Punk to end Punk's 434 day reign as champion. The following night on \"Raw\", Cena chose to face The Rock for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 29. At the event, Cena defeated The Rock to win the title."

        "text": "The Sacred Heart Pioneers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Sacred Heart University. The Pioneers are a member of Atlantic Hockey. They play at the Martire Family Arena in Fairfield, Connecticut. From 1993-2016, the Pioneers home arena was the Milford Ice Pavilion in Milford, Connecticut.\nHistory.\nDivision III.\nSacred Heart began sponsoring men's ice hockey as a varsity sport in 1993. The team was placed in the South Division of ECAC North/South/Central and because they were not able to schedule all of their ECAC South opponents twice the Pioneers played half a conference schedule in their inaugural year. With a full conference slate the following year, Sacred Heart greatly improved their record which continued in year three.\nFor the 1996–97 season Shaun Hannah was brought in as head coach and the Pioneers finished with their first winning record and 2nd in the division, narrowly missing the conference postseason.\nIn the late 1990s the MAAC was mandated to form an ice hockey conference. Two of the ECAC South programs would have to promote themselves to Division I and soon after they were joined by Sacred Heart. With an eye for their new conference, Hannah began offering scholarships to incoming students, a violation of Division III rules, which caused the Pioneers (along with two other ECAC South teams) to be ruled ineligible for any postseason play. Additionally all of their conference games would not be counted in the standings, through they would still be able to play the matches and count the results towards their overall standings.\nMAAC.\nDespite the influx of scholarship athletes, Sacred Heart finished 7th in the first year of MAAC conference play. The team rebounded in the second year, doubling their win total and finishing with a winning record. Postseason success was a little slower in coming with the Pioneers unable to win a playoff game until year 4 of D-I play. During the 2002–03 season Iona and Fairfield, the two original MAAC programs, both announced that they would end their sponsorship of ice hockey at the end of the season. With only one full-time member still active the MAAC terminated their ice hockey division. The remaining 9 programs banded together and formed Atlantic Hockey which began the following year.\nAtlantic Hockey.\nSacred Heart played well for the first few years of Atlantic Hockey, reaching the championship game in 2004 and 2010 but after Hannah left in 2009, the team took a tumble down the standings. From 2011 through 2018 the Pioneers never finished higher than 8th in the conference. Bench boss C. J. Marottolo was finally able to push the Pioneers out of the basement in 2019 with a 4th-place finish, ending 1 win shy of .500 on the year.\nThe school announced in 2020 that it would build a $60 million facility for its men's and women's ice hockey programs. After a delayed start, construction began on the Martire Family Arena in March 2021, with a new scheduled completion date of 2023 and a new price tag of $70 million.

        "text": "The Mercyhurst Lakers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association hockey team that represents Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania under Head Coach Rick Gotkin. The team is currently a Division I hockey team playing out of the Mercyhurst Ice Center located on the school campus. The Mercyhurst Lakers started out as a club sport at the school, moving up to Division III, followed by Division II, and now plays Division I in the Atlantic Hockey Association conference. After joining their step up into Division I in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference in 1998, the Lakers have won their conference tournament making NCAA tournament appearances in 2001, 2003, and 2005.\nHistory.\nClub Sport.\nChris Cuzzola, who was a student at Mercyhurst playing club hockey at Gannon University, happened to talk to former president of Mercyhurst University, William Garvey, about hockey. As a result of this, hockey would be instated as a club sport competing in the Erie Senior Hockey League for the 1986–1987 season. The coach for the first club season was Bob Cisek who was a Mercyhurst professor at the time. At the club level in the Erie Senior Hockey League, the Lakers went 15-0-3, finishing first in the league.\nDivision II &amp; Division III.\nAfter just 1 year at the club level, the Mercyhurst Lakers began an independent trial run at the varsity level, Division III in the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) South hockey league. Mercyhurst Athletic Director John Leisering stated, “The administration was immediately enthusiastic about a possible move to varsity status and with the support of the hockey people, the move was approved after just a few months.”\nNamed head coach for the Lakers in their first season at the Division III level was Fred Lane. Lane was one of the founding members for the Gannon University Golden Knights club hockey and was affiliated with the Gannon hockey program since 1967. As a player, he was Most Valuable Player his sophomore, junior, and senior years and coached the team in 1973 returning in 1978. In 10 seasons as the head coach for the Golden Knights, Lane had a record of 153–14–14, winning 2 Western Pennsylvania College Hockey Association league championships, 6 division championships, and was named WPCHA coach of the year 3 times. In addition to coaching, he was a member of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) and the Ontario Coaches Association.\nAlong with Head Coach Fred Lane, was Associate Coach Bob Cisek who ran the program a year ago at the club level. For the 1987–1988 season, the Lakers had a very competitive schedule in their first season as a Division III team playing a combination of both club and varsity teams. The Lakers opened up their first NCAA Division III season on Saturday, October 31 at West Chester University of Pennsylvania playing their home games at both the Erie Civic Center and Glenwood Ice Rink. The highlight of the season being the game against Division I Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey on November 25 which they lost 7–3. With 18 of the 28 players being freshmen on the team, Mercyhurst Lakers ended their first varsity season going 16–7–0.\nFollowing the 1987–1988 season, on April 29 of 1988, Mercyhurst College Athletic Director John Leisering named Rick Gotkin as head coach of the team saying, “Rick’s playing, coaching, and recruiting credentials were just the mix Mercyhurst was looking for.” At 28 years of age, Rick Gotkin comes from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which played at the Division I level in the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference where Gotkin served as Assistant Varsity Hockey Coach for the past 2 years (1986–1988). Before Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Gotkin was a coach at SUNY-Brockport (Division III), coached the Enschede Lions in the Netherlands, was head coach at SUNY-Canton (NCAA-Junior College), and was head coach of the Fife Flyers of the British Hockey League. After coaching Rensselaer, was hired as head coach for the Mercyhurst Lakers.\nFor the 1988–1989 season, the Mercyhurst Lakers played in the ECAC-West Division alongside SUNY-Brockport, Canisius College, SUNY-Fredonia, SUNY-Potsdam and St. Bonaventure University. In the Lakers first full season as an NCAA Division III program, the Lakers took a record of 11–1–1 under new Head Coach Rick Gotkin. The first time the Lakers would be ranked was in the 1990–1991 season where they ranked 9th in the short history of the team. During the 1991–1992, the Mercyhurst Lakers opened up their new rink on campus, the Mercyhurst Ice Center. \nAccording to the first Division II poll released, the Mercyhurst Lakers ranked 2nd in the 1992–1993 season only behind Bemidji State University. In that season, the Lakers finished with 2 wins and 3 losses against Division I teams. The wins coming against Kent State University and the University of Alabama-Huntsville and the losses coming from Kent State and two from the University of Alaska-Anchorage. The first time the team would be ranked 1st in their history was in December 1994. In the 1994–1995 season, the Lakers went 23-3-2 coming out with their first ever ECAC-West division championship and placing second in the NCAA Division II play-offs.\nIn September 1997, while the Meryhurst Lakers were playing in the ECAC-West division, the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) rounded up 8 teams to form a Division I hockey conference. Joining the conferences of Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference, Hockey East, Central Collegiate Hockey Association, and Western Collegiate Hockey Association in NCAA Division I men's ice hockey with 48 schools playing in 5 Division I conferences. The MAAC included Canisius College, Fairfield University, and Iona College (New York) as full members with American International College (AIC), University of Connecticut, Holy Cross College, Quinnipiac College, and Sacred Heart University as associate members with visions of Bentley University and Mercyhurst joining for the 1999–2000 season making the conference 10 teams.\nDivision I.\nIn May 1998, the Mercyhurst board of trustees approved the transition from Division II non-scholarship to play Division I ice hockey in the NCAA. The Lakers ended their long association with the Eastern College Athletic Conference West division to play Division I hockey in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. In the Lakers first full season at the Division I level in the 1999–2000 season, Mercyhurst went 20-14-2 with Rick Gotkin still as head coach of the team. In 2003, the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference reorganized to create the Atlantic Hockey Association with Quinnipiac, Connecticut, AIC, Canisius, Holy Cross, Sacred Heart, Bentley, Army Black Knights, and Mercyhurst as the 9 members of the league.\nCurrently the Atlantic Hockey Association contains 10 teams; Mercyhurst, AIC, Niagara University, Air Force Falcons, Army, Canisius, Sacred Heart, Bentley, Holy Cross, and Rochester Institute of Technology.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nAll-Americans.\nNCAA Division III / II\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC West.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-ECAC\nSecond Team All-ECAC\nMAAC.\nIndividual awards.\nDefensive Player of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nOffensive Rookie of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-MAAC\nSecond Team All-MAAC\nMAAC All-Rookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defenseman\nIndividual Sportsmanship Award\nRegular Season Goaltending Award\nRegular Season Scoring Trophy\nCoach of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nSecond Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nThird Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nAtlantic Hockey All-Rookie Team\nMercyhurst Ice Center.\nBefore the opening of the Mercyhurst Ice Center, the Mercyhurst Lakers played their games at the Erie Civic Center and Glenwood Ice Rink.

        "title": "UConn Huskies men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The UConn Huskies men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Connecticut. The Huskies are a member of the Hockey East conference. The Huskies play in the on-campus Toscano Family Ice Forum, having moved from the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut during the 2022–23 season.\nHistory.\nThe Huskies men's ice hockey program began in 1960 under head coach John Chapman. UConn began NCAA competition at the NCAA Division III level in the ECAC East.\nPrior to 1998, the Huskies played all home games outdoors at a partially enclosed rink on-campus near Memorial Stadium. The UConn Hockey Rink had a roof but was open on the sides. However, in preparation for the upgrade to Division I, the University built the Mark Edward Freitas Ice Forum. Construction began in 1996, and the first indoor home game for UConn was on November 7, 1998.\nThe move to NCAA Division I status allowed the team to join other Husky athletic programs. In 1998 they joined the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, after previously playing for 38 years in the Division III ECAC East. At the time, head coach Bruce Marshall was in his tenth season at the position. In its 2nd season in the 2000 MAAC Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, UConn beat Iona 6-1 to win its 1st league championship. However, due to a 2-year probationary period placed on the MAAC for an automatic bid to the NCAA Ice Hockey championship by the league champion, UConn was unable to participate in the NCAA tournament that year. It has been the only championship Uconn has won since moving to Division I. But when the athletic department was forced to remove all athletic scholarships from the sport in order to comply with Title IX, and the Huskies consistently finished in the bottom few spots of the national computer rankings before the most recent season. In 2003, the MAAC formed a new league called Atlantic Hockey.\nIn June 2010, the University announced that the team would face Sacred Heart at Rentschler Field in East Hartford on February 13, 2011, as part of a doubleheader also featuring a game between the women's team and the Providence Friars. The Huskies won this game 3-1, in front of 1,711 fans. The Huskies also played their first ever game at the XL Center in downtown Hartford that year, though this was not originally scheduled. Due to heavy snow accumulation on the Freitas roof, the team's February 5 game against Army was moved to the off-camps arena, also home to the Connecticut Whale of the American Hockey League. In spite of free admission, only 891 fans turned up on short notice to watch the Huskies lose 5-3. As a whole, the 2010-11 season was also a major improvement for the Huskies, who advance to the Atlantic Hockey Tournament semifinals at Blue Cross Arena before being eliminated. They finished with a final record of 16-18-4. One of the major factors in the turnaround was the young recruits the Huskies had signed. Freshman Cole Schneider led the team with 32 points, while sophomore Sean Ambrosie finished second with 29. Meanwhile, sophomore Garrett Bartus set a school record with 1,085 saves. The 2011-12 AHA preseason rankings reflected the newly gained reputation, with the Huskies ranked fifth out of twelve teams. The Huskies posted a winning record once again in the 2012-13 season.\nOn June 21, 2012, UConn announced the program would join Hockey East as the conference's 12th member beginning in the 2014-15 season. Prior to the move into Hockey East, on January 7, 2013, head coach Bruce Marshall resigned after 25 years and was replaced in interim by Asst. Dave Berard. The season ended with a record of 17-13-4. The team finished 4th in the AHA, drawing a crowd of 1438 for their final home game of the season against Sacred Heart. As part of the move from Atlantic Hockey to Hockey East, the university added 18 scholarships for the men's ice hockey team and additional scholarships to existing women's sports programs to meet Title IX gender equity requirements. The university also investigated options to significantly renovate the Freitas Ice Forum, which has a seating capacity around 2,000 fans, and mostly consists of metal bleachers; or build a new, larger ice arena on-campus. As a new member of Hockey East, the team played home games at the 15,635-seat former NHL arena, the XL Center in downtown Hartford, with other select (home) games at the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport. A study by the university projected a cost around $20,000 a game to play at the XL Center.\nHead coach Mike Cavanaugh, who spent 18 seasons as an assistant at Boston College, was hired to guide UConn into their new era of scholarship hockey in the Hockey East. He coached Uconn's final season (2013–14) in Atlantic Hockey to a record of 18-14-4, with wins over future Hockey East opponents Providence and Umass, while playing to a 2-2 draw with eventual 2014 NCAA Champ Union . Uconn made a successful transition to Hockey East in 2014-15 as they finished in the top 10 nationally in home attendance (5,396) while also leading their new conference . They were also competitive on the ice as their transition year resulted in 4 wins over top 20 teams while gaining ties with national championship game finalists Providence and Boston University. Starting in the 2015-16 season all home games were played at the XL Center, which drew a much better attendance per game (5,879) than those at the Webster Bank Arena (2,900) in which UConn appeared during the 2014-15 season.\nGroundbreaking took place on May 22, 2021 to start construction for UConn's new $48 million ice hockey rink at the Storrs campus, for an opening in fall 2022. The 2,600-seat Toscano Family Ice Forum opened in January 2023 adjacent to the current Freitas Ice Forum in the Athletics District on Jim Calhoun Way. The team facilities will also include team lounges; dry locker area and locker rooms with video displays; training space with a hydrotherapy area; strength and conditioning room; and other areas such as coaches' offices. The new 97,300-square-foot facility will meet all NCAA Division I ice hockey requirements and all Hockey East regulations, which the Freitas Ice Forum does not.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nCoaching staff.\nThe Huskies are coached by Mike Cavanaugh, the fourth head coach in program history.\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC East.\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nMAAC.\nIndividual awards.\nMAAC Defensive Rookie of the Year\nMAAC Tournament Most Valuable Player\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nRookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nRegular Season Goaltending Award\nRegular Season Scoring Trophy\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nThird Team\nRookie Team\nHockey East.\nIndividual awards.\nBest Defensive Forward\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nThird Team\nRookie Team\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nHuskies in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "Barker Lake Golf Course is a golf course that was built in the 1920s by the early prohibition gangster Joseph Saltis, who along with legendary mobsters Al Capone and Hymie Weiss, controlled Chicago's bootlegging business. Barker Lake Golf Course is located in Winter, Wisconsin, and is one of the oldest courses in the northern Wisconsin region, being open almost 90 years. It is still open to the public, and the clubhouse serves as a museum containing Joe Saltis memorabilia that his youngest son donated.\nSaltis effectively ran the southwest side of Chicago until 1929 when his operation began to fall apart after many gang wars and several disputes within the gang. Soon after Joe Saltis retired and spent the remainder of his years at his Baker Lake estate near Winter, Wisconsin. His Barker Lake estate included a lodge, several cabins, a barn, a bar/clubhouse, and a nine-hole golf course. Barker Lake Golf Course is a Scottish style golf course that Saltis had made to entertain himself and his guests during the summer, and in the winter it served as his hunting grounds. It took several years to complete, and even Kentucky soil was shipped in by train to help the richness of the clay-like northern Wisconsin soil. "

        "title": "Thousands Are Sailing",
        "text": "\"Thousands Are Sailing\" is a song by The Pogues, released in 1988. \nThe song is an Irish folk style ballad, written by Phil Chevron, and featured on The Pogues' album \"If I Should Fall from Grace with God\".\nLyrics.\nThe song consists of two 16-line verses, and three occurrences of a chorus that varies each time.\nThe song opens in the third-person voice, setting the song's place and tone: \"The island, it is silent now...\" The torch referred to is clearly that of the Statue of Liberty, and therefore \"the island\" is likely Ellis Island. The Ellis Island federal immigration station opened on 1 January 1892 and was closed in 1954, with twelve million immigrants processed there by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The song continues, \"...but the ghosts still haunt the waves...\" These ghosts are the Irish immigrants who did not survive the long ship crossing to America and whose souls now \"haunt the waves.\"\nThe first verse continues in the second-person voice, with a series of questions about post-immigration life, asked by a modern immigrant of an earlier one, first about employment (\"upon the railroad\"/as a police officer) and class (\"the White House\"/\"the five and dime\"), and then about homesickness. The older immigrant (a ghost, as his words reveal) answers that his voyage was on \"a coffin ship,\" and thus, having died on the journey, he has no answers. According to historical documentation, there was a 30% mortality rate on these coffin ships, and their reference is a recurring theme in many Irish folk songs. His response includes a reference to names being changed, another suggestion of Ellis Island, where Irish names were routinely anglicized.\nThe first chorus reverts to the third-person voice. It is the most optimistic of the three choruses, spoken from Ireland (the Atlantic is called \"the western ocean\") and calling America \"a land of opportunity,\" where hunger and poverty are overcome. Even so, it includes a somber note, that \"some of them will never see\" America.\nWith the second verse, the voice moves to the first-person and remains so through the end of the song. The setting is contemporary, making references to Brendan Behan, George M. Cohan, 'Dear old Time Square's favourite bard', and \"JFK\" (John F. Kennedy). The speaker is in New York City with a companion, enjoying the relatively easier time of the modern immigrant. However, even here there is a dark note: \"When I got back to my empty room, I suppose I must have cried.\"\nThe second chorus reveals why: \"the hand of opportunity draws tickets in a lottery.\" The U.S.'s Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 imposed quotas on Irish immigrants, awarding \"green cards\" via a lottery system. The chorus continues, to describe the furtive life of the illegal immigrant: \"from rooms the daylight never sees, where lights don't glow on Christmas trees.\"\nThe final chorus summarizes the conflicted psychology of the Irish emigrant (\"where'er we go we celebrate the land that makes us refugees\") and takes a parting shot at the Irish Catholic church: \"from fear of priests with empty plates/ from guilt, and weeping effigies.\"\nLegacy.\n\"Thousands Are Sailing\" was one of the inspirations for the graphic novel \"Gone to Amerikay\", by Derek McCulloch and Colleen Doran.\nThe first few seconds of the song serve as a repeating sample in Berry Sakharof's song 'White Noise' (Hebrew: רעש לבן, Ra-ash Lavan), from his 1993 album \"Signs of Weakness\"."

        "title": "Canisius Golden Griffins men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Canisius Golden Griffins men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Canisius College. The Golden Griffins are a member of Atlantic Hockey. They play at the LECOM Harborcenter in Buffalo, New York across the street from KeyBank Center, home of the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League. Canisius has won an automatic bid to the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament twice, after winning the Atlantic Hockey title in the conference playoffs in both 2013 and 2023, but lost in the first round to the top-ranked team each time.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCanisius founded their hockey team, then known as the Ice Griffs, in the fall of 1971 as a club sport led by Dr. David Dietz. Two years later they joined their first conference and by 1976 had claimed two conference titles. Dietz resigned after the 1976 championship and allowed Mike Kelly to take over. Kelly kept the team performing at a high level but finished runner up two years running before reclaiming the title in 1979. Canisius join a new conference the following year and after claiming the championship, their fourth in a six-year span, the program was elevated to varsity status.\nWith a new division to play in Canisius also received a new coach in Brian Cavanaugh. Their first two seasons in Division III went well for the Golden Griffins but when Cavanaugh took a year off in 1982 the program slumped to single-digit wins before rebounding after the coach's return. During Cavanaugh's tenure he kept the team mostly above .500 and aside from a dip in the early 1990s Canisius was a contender for the ECAC West crown most years. Canisius was able to reach two ECAC West title game in the '90s but lost both contests by one goal.\nDivision I.\nWhen the MAAC announced it was forming an ice hockey division in 1997 only three member teams had extant programs, one of those was Canisius who became a founding member of the league that began play in 1998–99. The Golden Griffins played well in their first season, finishing with a winning record, but it was their play in the conference tournament, allowing them to reach the title match, that made Canisius stand out. Unfortunately that was the height of Canisius' time in the MAAC. Despite a 20-win season the following year the Griffs were bounced in the first round and won only one MAAC playoff game after their inaugural year in D-I.\nWhen two of the MAAC's teams ended their ice hockey sponsorship in 2003 the conference was able to end its support for the hockey division. The remaining nine schools simply reformed into a new conference called Atlantic Hockey and continued on without much trouble. Canisius' trouble in the conference tournament continued throughout the decade and saw them win two out of their first ten games. During that streak, however, the Canisius program went through some upheaval. Long-time coach Brian Cavanaugh came under fire for his conduct through complaints from his players. In December 2004 he was fired when players threatened to sit out a game and he was soon replaced by assistant Clancy Seymour. The following season began with yet a third coach, Dave Smith and it took the new bench boss a few years to repair the program.\nIn 2009–10 Canisius posted its first winning season in nine years and reach the conference semifinal. After a couple of modest seasons the Golden Griffins shocked Atlantic Hockey by winning the 2013 Tournament as a 7th-seed and made its first appearance in the NCAA tournament. The Golden Griffins played well but bowed out in their first game against top-seeded Quinnipiac. Over the next few years Smith pushed the program to better results, culminating in their first conference title in 2017. Smith was hired away by Rensselaer soon after but the Golden Griffins continue to perform well under new coach Trevor Large.\nThe Golden Griffins finished fourth in the 2022–23 Atlantic Hockey division standings. Canisius defeated fifth seeded Army in three games to advance to the conference tournament semifinals, where they defeated sixth seeded Niagara in three games and advanced to their second straight conference championship game, their first as hosts. The Golden Griffins went on to defeat seventh seeded Holy Cross by a score of 3–0 to clinch the program's second appearance in the NCAA tournament. Canisius faced the No. 1 seeded Minnesota Golden Gophers in the opening round of the tournament. Canisius maintained a 2–1 lead early in the second period thanks to goals by forwards Daniel DiGrande and Nick Bowman, before allowing two goals to make the score 3–2 heading into the third period. The Golden Griffins would end up losing to the Golden Gophers by a score of 9–2, finishing the season with a 20–19–3 record.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nAll-time coaching records.\n&lt;br&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nMAAC.\nIndividual awards.\nMAAC Goaltender of the Year\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-MAAC\nSecond Team All-MAAC\nMAAC All-Rookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defenseman\nRegular Season Scoring Trophy\nRegular Season Goaltending Award\nIndividual Sportsmanship Award\nMost Valuable Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nSecond Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nThird Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nAtlantic Hockey All-Rookie Team\nCanisius Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of Canisius' men's ice hockey players who were elected into the Canisius College Hall of Fame (induction year in parentheses).\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nNotable former players.\nNotable alumni include:"

The Falcons are an original member of Atlantic Hockey, The Falcons play their home games at the Bentley Arena on the school's campus in Waltham, Massachusetts, having moved into the new, on-campus arena in February 2018. The Falcons are coached by former Falcon forward Ryan Soderquist ('00), the program's all-time scoring leader.\nHistory.\nHockey at Bentley began as a modest club team organized by students in the mid-1960s. Bentley Hall of Famer Reg Pearless was the first captain. The team gained official varsity status beginning with the 1977–78 season, and claimed consecutive ECAC 3 championships in 1980 and 1981.\nThe program made a provisional move to Division I for the 1998–99 season, and became a full Division I member for the following season, being a member of the MAAC. The Falcons then became one of the founding members of Atlantic Hockey when the league was founded for the 2003–04 season.\nThe team played its home games at the John A. Ryan Arena in Watertown from 1977 to 2018, before they moved into their new, on-campus home, Bentley Arena in February 2018.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nUniform.\nThe Falcons have undergone a couple of uniform changes since the start of the 2010–2011 season. In accordance with the new Bentley brand, the Falcon's moved away from the white, navy and gold color scheme. The first switch made was to their road uniform. They moved from navy blue, with gold \"Bentley\" lettering, and white trim to a black uniform with a navy blue B in the middle and white trim. The new home uniforms were unveiled in the 2013–2014 season, and are still their current home uniforms. They are white with the Bentley back and grey B in the middle, navy blue and black trim, and black numbers/names on jerseys on the back. The new home jerseys were unveiled at Frozen Fenway on 12/28/2014. To start the 2014–2015 season, the Falcon's unveiled another new road uniform.

        "text": "The American International Yellow Jackets men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the American International College. The Yellow Jackets are a member of Atlantic Hockey. They play at the MassMutual Center in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nAIC began its varsity program in 1948, playing a modest schedule for the first dozen years, building the program under William Turner before he handed it off to Joe Bucholz. In 1961, the Yellow Jackets joined with 27 other eastern schools (mostly in New England) to form ECAC Hockey. AIC finished near the bottom for three seasons and in 1964 it was decided that the conference was too unwieldy to continue and was split into two divisions. The Yellow Jackets joined the lower division, becoming a founding member of ECAC 2.\nAmerican International had some success when Turner returned to take over, winning the conference tournament in 1969, but dipped slightly after his retirement in 1970. When Paul Thornton took over in 1974, AIC saw a resurgence, and by the late 1970s, it had returned to the ECAC 2 Tournament, but after his departure in 1978, the program slumped once more.\nIn 1984, the Division II ice hockey level collapsed and sent almost all teams at that level down to Division III. AIC followed along, and when ECAC 2 split, the Yellow Jackets stayed with the eastern side, joining the new ECAC East. In all that upheaval, it was not lost that American International had gotten its sixth head coach since 1970, but they were finally able to find someone willing to stick around in Gary Wright.\nWright's time with AIC began successfully, with the team earning its first 20-win season in his fourth year. The following season, 1989, saw the Yellow Jackets pace the ECAC East with 20 wins and set a program record with 24 wins overall. Still, they faltered in the conference tournament and failed to make the D-III National championship. The following year, they won the ECAC East title, their first conference championship in 21 years. However, they were left out of the National Tournament due to a relatively poor overall record (only eight teams made the tournament, and the league champions did not receive an automatic berth). AIC continued to play well in the mid-90s, but in 1995, the program declined sharply, dropping from 14 to 4 wins, and remained in the ECAC East cellar for the rest of its time there.\nIn 1998, the MAAC began sponsoring an ice hockey conference, and AIC joined as an affiliate member, returning to the top tier of college hockey. In their first year back the Yellow Jackets posted a decent record, finishing 5th in the 8-team field but bowed out in the first round of the conference playoffs. After that brief glimpse of success, however, AIC fell to the bottom of the conference and remained there for almost the next 20 years. Even with several new teams joining the conference and the division's reworking into Atlantic Hockey, AIC could finish no better than 9th from 2000 through 2017, with the lone exception coming in 2006 when Atlantic Hockey had only 8 league members.\nAIC lost 20 games for 13 consecutive seasons and 18 out of 19 years after 1999.

        "text": "Martin Clarke (born 22 May 1967) is an Australian former professional basketball player and coach. He is the former head coach of the National Basketball League's Adelaide 36ers and was an assistant coach of the Australian Boomers at the 2012 London Olympics. In 2018, Clarke was hired as the director of the NBA Global Academy at the Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence in Canberra.\nPlaying career.\nAs a player, Clarke was a Guard who originally played for the Devonport Warriors in the Tasmanian State League in 1984. He was then offered a scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) where he played for the program's South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) team from 1985 to 1987. While attending the AIS, Clarke captained the Australian Under-19 team to fifth place at the 1987 FIBA Under-19 World Championship held in Bormio, Italy.\nMarty Clarke then joined the NBL's North Melbourne Giants in 1988, playing 120 games with the club until retiring at the end of the 1992 season. His time at the Giants included winning the 1989 NBL Championship over the Canberra Cannons with a 2–1 series win. The win reversed the Grand Final result of the previous season where the Cannons had defeated the Giants 2–0.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from playing, Marty Clarke began his coaching career in his native Tasmania, where he coached in the Tasmanian State League from 1993–1997. In 1996, he was appointed as Head Coach at the Tasmanian Intensive Training Centre program, a position he held until 1998.\nAustralian Institute of Sport.\nClarke then relocated to Australia's capital city Canberra, where from 1998-2002 he was the Assistant Coach at the Australian Institute of Sport. He was then named as head coach of the AIS from 2003–2010. Clarke was also Australian National Junior Team Assistant Coach from 2001–2003, and Head Coach from 2005–2009, coaching such players as current NBA players Andrew Bogut and Patrick Mills along with European-based Aussie Boomers Brad Newley and Joe Ingles.\nAdelaide 36ers.\nOn 29 March 2010, Clarke took up a three-year role with the Adelaide 36ers as head coach starting in the 2010–11 NBL season. Despite his previous coaching experience, it was his first time in charge of a professional team at club level. His first two seasons as 36ers coach were far from successful. The four-time championship winning club was coming off its first ever wooden spoon in 2009–10, and expectations were high for a move back up the competition ladder. However, the 36ers only improved to 8th in 2010–11, and, for the first time the club failed to win at least 10 games in an NBL season, finishing with a 9–19 record. His second season as an NBL coach would also prove to be of little joy as the club slumped to its second ever wooden spoon with an 8–20 record. The 2011–12 NBL season also saw the 36ers endure a club record eight game losing streak\nGoing into the 2012–13 NBL season, much was expected of the Clarke coached 36ers who had recruited well (helped by the demise of the Gold Coast Blaze) with players such as Adam Gibson, Anthony Petrie and Jason Cadee joining the club and many experts pre-season predictions had Adelaide as top-3 contenders. The team started the season well, with a 5–4 record after two months of the season and a place in the top 4 after Round 8 This included back to back wins over the Perth Wildcats, with the second win seeing Adelaide spoil the Wildcats first game at the new 14,856 seat Perth Arena on 16 November. This would prove to be the 36ers last win for the 2012 calendar year as they embarked on another eight game losing streak and slumped to a 5–11 record by the end of Round 14.\nFollowing the club's record equalling eighth loss in a row (against the Sydney Kings at the Sydney Entertainment Centre) on 5 January, speculation was rife in the Adelaide media that Clarke would be replaced as 36ers head coach, though the club's owners and management remained tight lipped on the situation. Following the loss to Sydney, the 36ers played the Kings at home the following week. The team stopped its slide with an 82–64 win, after which the club released a statement telling Clarke would see out his contract.\nOn 4 April 2013, Clarke's contract was not renewed with the 36ers, parting ways with the club after 3 seasons having led the team to a second last place finish and two consecutive wooden spoons.\nAustralian Boomers.\nOn 8 March 2011, Marty Clarke was named as Assistant Coach of the Australian Boomers. Clarke replaced outgoing assistant Shane Heal who stepped down from the position due to time constraints. Clarke joined then head coach Brett Brown (who resigned as coach following the 2012 London Olympics citing wanting to spend more time with his family and also his job as assistant coach with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs), and fellow assistants Andrej Lemanis (New Zealand Breakers head coach), and technical assistant Mo Dakhil.\nSaint Mary's.\nAfter not being re-signed as coach of the Adelaide 36ers, Marty Clarke was hired as an assistant coach for the Saint Mary's Gaels (the former college of Boomers Patty Mills and Matthew Dellavedova) who play in the West Coast Conference of the NCAA."

He's been a great assistant to me and he's got the respect of everybody there in the playing group so I'm elated for him.\"\n\"It's the way it should work.\"\n\"He knows what works. He's seen it now, he's lived it,\" Bennett said. \"He'll have his personality, put his own pieces to it, but the end result is he knows what works.\"\n\"There is no reason why he should be daunted by the task.\"\n\"I wouldn't be if I was his age.\"\n\"When I came to the Dragons there was only two staff that I kept here and he was one of them,\" Bennett said.\n\"I made a few inquiries and everywhere I went, the ex-players and current players, they all had a wrap on him.

        "title": "1950–51 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1950–51 Ashes series consisted of five cricket Test matches, each of six days with five hours play each day and eight ball overs. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1950–51 and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. The England team under the captaincy of the big-hearted all-rounder Freddie Brown was regarded as the weakest sent to Australia and \"without Bedser and Hutton, England would have been little better than a club side\". Few gave them a chance of regaining the Ashes and they lost the series 4–1 to Lindsay Hassett's Australian team, which had far greater reserves of talent. In the Fifth and final Test England beat Australia for the first time since 1938 and ended their unbeaten run of 14 Tests against England, 26 Tests against all teams and 96 games in all cricket since the Second World War. After this victory England would defeat Australia in 1953, 1954–55 and 1956.\nIt was a great all round team effort from the Australians; the captain Lindsay Hassett made 366 runs (40.66), Neil Harvey 362 runs (40.22), Keith Miller 350 runs (43.75) and Jim Burke 125 runs (41.66). The fast bowler Ray Lindwall took 15 wickets (22.93), his new-ball partner Keith Miller 17 wickets (17.70), Bill Johnston 22 wickets (19.18) and the mystery spin of Jack Iverson 21 wickets (15.23) in his only Test series. This was the first Ashes series to be played since the retirement of Don Bradman and it saw the debut of Ken Archer, Jim Burke, Graeme Hole and Jack Iverson for Australia and John Warr and Roy Tattersall for England.\nDespite their defeat it was two English players who dominated the series; Len Hutton \"a Titan among the minnows\" made 533 runs (88.83) with an average double that of any other batsman, English or Australian. Alec Bedser took 30 wickets (16.06) and began his dominance of Australian batsmen that would continue into 1953, when he and Hutton would be instrumental in regaining the Ashes for England. The forty-year-old Freddie Brown had a successful series and won considerable popularity with his jovial determination to fight on regardless of the odds. Given the close results in the First and Second Tests it is possible that England could have won had Bill Edrich or Jim Laker been brought over, or Denis Compton had been fully fit. The Middlesex strokemaker had a chequered tour, averaging 7.57 in the Tests and 92.11 in his other First Class matches.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\nPreliminaries.\n\"The First Test between Australia and England is played nowadays at Brisbane. Nobody seems to know why, and all sorts of arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the Woolloongabba ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at Brisbane only a Hutton could stay, let alone score runs.\"\nSelection of the Australian team would seem to be a simple process as eight of its members were highly talented cricketers who almost picked themselves; Lindsay Hassett, Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey, Don Tallon, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Ian Johnson, and Bill Johnston. Don Tallon replaced Ron Saggers who had kept wicket on the tour of South Africa in 1949–50, which Tallon had missed. Ray Lindwall had been dropped for the last Test in South Africa, his form suffering from a series of ailments, but was recalled to the team to replace Geff Noblet. Batsmen Jack Moroney and Sam Loxton kept their places, but leg-spinner Colin McCool was replaced by the 35-year-old debutant mystery spinner Jack Iverson. The task for the England tour selectors was not quite so easy. The managers Brigadier Michael Green and John Nash, captain Freddie Brown, vice-captain Denis Compton and senior professional Len Hutton kept most of the team from the Fourth and final Test against the West Indies in 1950. This was not the best recommendation as they had lost the series 3–1 and the last Test by an innings even though Hutton carried his bat for 202 out of 344. Freddie Brown, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Reg Simpson, John Dewes, Trevor Bailey, Arthur McIntyre, Alec Bedser, Doug Wright all stayed, but the young opener David Sheppard was replaced by veteran Cyril Washbrook and Godfrey Evans returned as wicket-keeper. Apart from Hutton, Washbrook, Compton and Simpson the batsmen were not in fine form. Dewes was chosen after he had made a gritty 117 against Queensland in the last tour match before the Test. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was in the team for his batting and as \"Brown's Cows\" were desperately short of good fielders and McIntyre had a good throwing arm. While the crowd was waiting for the captains to come out and toss a dapper little man came out and inspected the pitch and he passed by the spectators completely unnoticed. It was the Test selector Sir Donald Bradman, such is fame. Keith Miller had recently made a slow 201 not out against Queensland on the flat Woolloongabba pitch and predicted that the Test would be \"the dullest in history\". Lindsay Hassett won the toss (as he would 9 times out of 10 in Ashes Tests) and although the Woolloongabba Ground had a reputation as \"result\" wicket it looked plumb and he batted without hesitation.\nAustralia – First Innings.\n\"Seldom has an England cricket team gone into the field with the odds greater against them than did the side under Freddie Brown's command at Brisbane on the first day of December 1950. The tour had up to that date been one long succession of inglorious displays that had riled the critics without exception...it was no exaggeration to state that before the game began not one man in the crowd of 13,000 was prepared for the shocks that followed.\"\n\"Brown called his team together the night before the Test began. His first words were \"Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it.\" He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.\"\nOne of the good points about the tour so far had been the rise of Trevor Bailey as new ball partner for Alec Bedser. He bowled the first over, but mistimed his run up for the first ball and had to walk back and start again, swinging his fourth ball to tickle the edge of Jack Moroney's bat and send it to Len Hutton at fine leg for a duck.\nNeil Harvey joined Arthur Morris and they took the score to 66/1 by lunch, though Morris constantly played and missed at Bedser's in-swingers and made only 24 runs to 38 by the more fluent Harvey. Doug Wright (1/81) came on to bowl a typical over with two long hops, which Harvey cracked into the square-leg fence, but the first ball of the next had him groping at a googly that turned so fiercely that it missed both bat and stumps, \"a real pearl that morally bowled Harvey all the way\". The following ball had Wright appealing for lbw, but it was turned down as it turned so much that it would have missed the stumps.\nReturning after the break Bedser dismissed the labouring Morris lbw to bring Keith Miller on at 69/2. England's fielding had dramatically improved over its reputation on tour – Bedser had bowled seven eight ball overs for 6 runs – but these two strokemakers increased the run rate much to the joy of the crowd. Miller hit a typical Doug Wright over for 12 as he served up a mixture of full tosses, long hops, googlies, fierce leg-breaks and cunningly flighted balls. Harvey's 50 with 6 boundaries brought a cheer from the crowd, and he hit 3 more, a cover-drive and a pull off Bedser and dancing three steps down the wicket to hit Wright to the sightscreen. The Kent spinner returned to the wicket with his hop, skip and a jump and bowled a googly that Miller mishit it to a surprised Arthur McIntyre at short mid-on to have him out for 15.\nLindsay Hassett was almost out first ball to Bedser, but a difficult chance was missed by Denis Compton and the Australian captain took a single. Bedser then bowled one of his rare out-swingers to Neil Harvey, Godfrey Evans taking the catch and whipping off the bails to have the Victorian left-hander caught and stumped, but the bowler's umpire responded first and Harvey was \"c. Evans b. Bedser\" for 74.\nHassett did not survive long, his off-stump was knocked over by a Bedser \"special\" and from 116/2 Australia had collapsed to 129/5. Freddie Brown came on the relieve Bedser and Evans took another great catch to remove Loxton (24), though Ray Lindwall (41) saw Australia to tea for 166/6.\nBrown (2/63) continued after the break, mixing up his medium-paced seamers with leg-spin to have the out of form Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon caught by Reg Simpson on the square leg boundary at 172/7.\nLindwall and Ian Johnson held things up for three-quarters of an hour while adding 47 before Bailey (3/28) took the new ball. Simpson caught Johnson off Bailey and Bedser took Lindwall to give Bailey his third wicket.\nBedser was brought back on and Bill Johnston flipped him over the slips to the boundary. As he came to a halt half way down the pitch he stopped to chat with Alec while Iverson completed two runs. Only now did Johnston realise that Reg Simpson had stopped the ball and was throwing it in to Evans. He ran back towards his crease running like a duck trying to take off from water alongside Iverson making his third run. Johnston got home, Iverson stopped two yards short to turn back to the bowler's end, but Evans missed the bowler's stumps and he was safe.\nAfter this comedy routine Bedser (4/45) had Bill Johnston caught by Hutton in the slips to dismiss Australia for 228 ten minutes before stumps, the last 4 wickets falling for just 9 runs. This low score after Australia had chosen to bat on a good wicket was a coup for the touring team, whose performance surprised everyone, it now only remained to see how well their batsmen could perform.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"...the ball proceeded to perform capers all against the laws of gravitation, and there came the craziest day's cricket imaginable, with twenty wickets falling for 130 runs and two declarations that must surely be unique in the annuals of Test cricket.\"\nOn the recommendation of an MCC committee member in Australia the tour selectors had decided to demote Len Hutton – the best opener in the world – to bat at number 5 so that he could stiffen the fragile lower order. This was possible as they had two other openers in Cyril Washbrook and Reg Simpson and Hutton declined to object as he was outvoted and did not want to appear obstinate. The two new openers went out to the middle on the first day, but Simpson successfully appealed for bad light and no ball was bowled. It rained on the Saturday morning and though it dried out on the rest day that followed more rain poured down overnight and play was suspended until the Monday afternoon. Keith Miller and Denis Compton took advantage of the situation by going to the local horse racing track, ringing the ground to check when play was to resume and dashing back just in time.\nAlthough other First Class games had their pitches covered they were not for Test matches – a ruling that would change as a result of what was to follow. The pitch was reduced to a \"mudheap\", \"sticky dog\" or \"glue-pot\" so beloved by purists as only a batsman with classic technique could hope to play on it, in other words Len Hutton. The roller reduced the effects of the rain and Simpson (12) and Washbrook (19) added 28 for the first wicket while the going was good.\nThe wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans (16) was brought in as a \"daywatchman\" while the pitch dried out to normality. Ray Lindwall bowled only one over before being taken off and Keith Miller (2/29) and Bill Johnston (5/35) were brought on by Hassett to exploit the conditions with their part-time spin as England collapsed from 49/1 to 67/7 as good length balls leapt chest-high, shot along the ground, turned and straightened.\nBrown declared on 68/7, 160 runs behind, a move without precedent in Test cricket, but the England captain wanted to get the Australians onto the pitch before it dried out and became inhabitable. With hindsight he should have delayed as Hutton was still 8 not out and could have added some runs. As it was England was forced to bat again before stumps, but few captains anticipate getting Australia 32/7.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\n\"...the ball hit first a thigh, then a chest. Sometimes it would go over the batsman’s head, and whenever it came through at a playable height one of the many pairs of snatching hands in the leg trap took a catch that spelled doom first to Morris, then Loxton and finally Harvey. Miller, Moroney, Ian Johnson and Hassett preferred to thrust their legs in the way and found the umpire in league with the opposition on this afternoon of \"crazy\" cricket.\"\nIf the English batsmen had struggled the Australians completely floundered. Jack Moroney, Arthur Morris and Sam Loxton were out for ducks and Australia were 0/3 in a matter of minutes as Trevor Bailey took his new best Test figures of 4/22 and Alec Bedser 3/9. This was the worst start to a Test innings until Alec Bedser and Fred Trueman reduced India to 0/4 at Headingley in 1952. Neil Harvey top-scored with 12, but the only runs came from the edge of the bat and after an hour Hassett gave up and declared on 32/7, leaving England 193 to win. This was a gamble as although there was still time to take quick wickets the pitch might recover the next day.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n\"At Brisbane, on a wicket that was the worst that I have ever seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high deliveries of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, out of the way of the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.\"\nThe batting captain is allowed seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown asked for the heavy roller to press down the wicket and take some of the demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown did not get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great importance as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual \"rolling\" instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially it made no difference as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc; When Simpson was out one wag called out \"How long Bill, and how many fours?\" which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd.\nCyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch to get rid of the Lancastrian (Washbrook) off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball.\nBedser holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run.\nBrown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win \"if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again\". It did not rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes.\nIn the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans \"c Loxton, b Johnston\".\nBrown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43).\nDoug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit-and-miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that \"with a bit of luck I'd have won the game\".\nResult.\n\"Australia's cricket ego was in no way deflated by what happened at Brisbane. All teams have their bad days, and that generally was considered sufficient excuse for Australia's collapse for 228 on a plumb pitch: as for the other collapse – Australian cricket thought does not believe in pondering long over national deficiencies on a sticky pitch. The possibility of a wet pitch in Brisbane was suggested by other Tests there and the weather preceding the game. There was too many clouds about in Brisbane for the city to miss rain for a whole week. Old women of both sexes \"[sic]\" were blaming our weather upsets on the atomic bomb experiment carried out by the Americans on Bikini Atoll, to our north... and so there was no national caterwauling over Australia's loss of face at Brisbane. Few stopped to think that had Australia lost the toss, they would have certainly have lost the Test.\"\nAustralia won the First Test at Brisbane by 70 runs to go 1–0 up in the series, but the real winners were England and Australian cricket. Before the match the press and public had been contemplating a one-sided contest in which a weak England team would be overwhelmed by Australia, now they had a fighting series on their hands. Few Australians fail to credit a gutsy performance and the stock of the tourists rocketed. It was also apparent that Australia had a chink in their armour as their batting collapsed on a perfectly good wicket on the first day and had been badly shown up on the rain-affected wicket on the third, but their bowling remained strong and Jack Iverson (4/43) had justified the selector's confidence in him.\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\n\"It was apparent that Brown could just string together a Test Eleven, and that was all. Nothing had been more disappointing that the continued poor showings by the young men of the side. Bailey was the only new-comer to lend an accomplished hand. So badly had the others shaped that Close...was to be given a Test berth in Melbourne on the strength of a second innings century against a country team at Canberra.\"\nThe main story leading up to the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the health of the England vice-captain Denis Compton. His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century – 115 vs an Australian XI – and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager Brigadier Michael Green expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was replaced by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the Australian XI game and opener Ken Archer (12th man at Brisbane) was given his Baggy Green ahead of the middle order batsman Jim Burke (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128. Lindsay Hassett won the toss and batted first on a yellow, matted wicket made for batting.\nAustralia – First Innings.\n\"...at Melbourne the young boys and girls go almost hysterical...I know several English cricketers who used to breath a sigh of relief whenever they reached the security of their quarters without the loss of a tie, a button, or even a cap...no film stars ever had more adulation that did the cricketers of England and Australia – especially the young ones – for the few brief days around Christmas at Melbourne in the year 1950.\"\nIt was too much to hope for that Alec Bedser would dismiss Arthur Morris cheaply for the third time in a row, but he did in his second over and the Australian vice-captain was taken by Len Hutton in the slips for 2. Neil Harvey (42) came in at 6/1 and Australia were 67/1 at lunch despite the bowling of Bedser (who bowled unchanged throughout the morning) and Bailey and surprisingly good English fielding. Hassett even apologised to Brown as the ball constantly fell just short of the slips, or flew over their heads as Harvey rode his luck. After lunch Bedser tickled Harvey's edge with a ball that Godfrey Evans snapped up instinctively, but had he missed few would have realised was a chance. The big bowler then held onto Ken Archer (26) in the slips by throwing himself to the ground and taking the ball in his outstretched right hand and Australia were 89/3. Keith Miller, whose matinée idol looks greatly affected his teenager fans, made 18, but his potential boundaries were stymied by Cyril Washbrook in the covers and Reg Simpson on the boundary-fence and he was trapped lbw by Freddie Brown (1/28) to bring Australia down to 93/4 on a good pitch on a perfect sunny day. Lindsay Hassett played a careful captain's innings of 52, adding 84 in an hour and a half with Sam Loxton (32). Brian Close was a short-leg to Hassett and kept on edging closer until he was almost face-to-face. He was brought on to rest Bedser and Bailey before the new ball was taken and Loxton was given \"not out\" when he appeared to give Hutton a straightforward catch in the gully. Soon after Loxton was out to a catch by Evans off Close when he \"didn't\" make contact and he glared at the umpire; \"Tha' were lucky once, Sam\" said Hutton \"so don't grouse\" and Australia were 177/5, which soon became 177/6 when Bedser yorked Hassett while loosening up with the old ball. The new ball was taken and Bedser (4/37) and Bailey (4/40) promptly cleared up the tail for 17 runs and Australia were all out for 194 at stumps.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"...the Yorkshireman's bewildered look, as he walked slowly away, set all tongues wagging, and the fact that Close came and went passed almost unnoticed. Many were the theories advanced in support of Umpire Cooper, an Adelaide man, during the interval, but the dressing-rooms on both sides seethed with indignation, and Hutton had the consolation of knowing that several of the Australians nearer to the ball than Iverson, considered a mistake had been made.\"\nWith Australians out for their third low score in a row and with no rain in sight England had every chance of making a large total on a good wicket and equalising the series. It was an opportunity they did not take as Ian Johnson caught Reg Simpson (4) off Keith Miller (2/39), who then took a magnificent driving catch to take John Dewes (8) off Bill Johnston (2/28). Cyril Washbrook was joined by Len Hutton – still batting in the middle order – to re-establish their old partnership and set about restoring the innings. Washbrook (21) made some charming cover-drives before he was given out lbw to Ray Lindwall (2/46), although only he and Don Tallon appealed and the other nine fielders remained silent. Jack Iverson was brought on and saw a ball flick off Hutton's pads as he checked a sweep (it was the over before lunch). Iverson yelled \"Catch it\", Tallon dived forwards to take the ball an inch off the ground and the bewildered opener was given out for 12. Only Iverson appealed and \"Not even Tallon, one of the most notorious appealers of all time, asked for a catch\". and Miller, standing four feet away at silly-leg \"stood there with his arms folded, feet wide apart, completely uninterested\" Hutton returned to the pavilion with a face like thunder and Umpire Cooper was obviously upset that he so obviously disagreed with the decision and ended the over after only seven balls. One Yorkshireman was soon followed by another as Brian Close swished a ball to Sam Loxton and England went into lunch on 54/5. Captain Freddie Brown and Gilbert Parkhouse returned to the crease after lunch and made the best of things, but the Welshman's stilt-like footwork was his undoing and he was caught by Hassett off Miller. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who steadfastly defended at one end while his captain brought the crowd to its feet hitting Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. Godfrey Evans hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a boxer, and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was \"c Johnson, b Iverson\" for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. Alec Bedser (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but Doug Wright (2) only lasted five minutes and England were out for 197, exceeding Australia's First Innings by only 3 runs. This was both a failure and a relief, given how the innings had progressed.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\n\"Australia was 151 for seven – and the man wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the remarkable part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was his name on the board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.\"\nKen Archer (15 not out) and Arthur Morris (10 not out) saw Australia safely to Christmas Eve with 25/0 and a 22 run lead. They returned on Boxing Day and took their partnership to 43 when Morris (18) was lbw to Doug Wright and Ron Wright with the leg-spinner giving him a straight ball and the umpire raising his finger. Neil Harvey made another profitable second wicket stand before Archer (46) was taken in the gully by Trevor Bailey off Bedser (2/43) on 99/2. Harvey soon went, run out by Cyril Washbrook who made a splendid pick up in the covers and threw down his stumps when backing up to Miller. Miller himself was bowled by Bailey (2/47), then Brown (4/26) broke the back of the Australian innings with the wickets of Loxton, Lindwall, Tallon and Hassett in spell of 4/5. The Australian wicket-keeper was snatched by a diving Trevor Bailey at second slip, which Bill O'Reilly called \"truly sensational\" and Jack Fingleton \"unforgettable\". Ian Johnson (23) decided to hit out on the advice of Keith Miller and added a vital 30 runs with Bill Johnston (6) before Bedser and Bailey got them out on 181 and closed the innings.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n\"The flies were bad. Little black ones. They pestered the batsmen and fieldsmen incessantly. Ranjitsinhji once explained that his dismissal in Sydney by saying that a fly got into his eye as the vital moment, which could well be true. They are an intense annoyance to a batsman, who must time his last quick flip of his face as the bowler is a few yards off delivery.\"\nEngland needed 179 runs to win, not an impossible task even though John Dewes had been struck with a throat inflection and had been absent from the field. Brown continued with his opening partnership of Reg Simpson and Cyril Washbrook and kept Len Hutton in the middle order. To be fair they had made 212 for the first wicket against the West Indies at Trent Bridge earlier in the year. On this occasion they added 21 against Lindwall and Miller when the spinners were brought on. Washbrook always found \"Wrong Grip Jake\" difficult to play and was bowled by his googly. The nightwatchman Trevor Bailey by bowled by Ian Johnson (1/24) for a duck and England were 28/2 at stumps. Simpson and Hutton \"opened\" the innings again in the morning, Hutton was inclined to fancy England's chances if he stayed in past lunch, and he did, but Simpson was bowled by Lindwall (3/29) for 28. John Dewes, coming in to bat from his sick bed like Eddie Paynter in the Fourth Test of 1932–33, stayed in for 46 minutes making a gutsy 5 before falling to Iverson (2/36) at 82/4. In the lunch break England needed less than a hundred runs to win and there was an earnest discussion as to whether Hutton should bat in his usual careful way or should try to make the runs before he ran out of partners, as had happened at Brisbane. He decided on the latter and by forcing the pace struck out at Bill Johnston (4/26) and was caught at square leg for 40, which caused a deathly silence across the 50,000 strong crowd. As in the first innings Brian Close was soon out (lbw to Johnston for 1), Brown was bowled by Lindwall, who then removed Evans \"with a ball which pitched outside the off stump, came in at a crazy angle and knocked back the off stump without leaving the turf by a centimetre\". Gilbert Parkhouse, who batted manfully for 102 minutes and when he was out for 28 England were 134/9 and still needed 45 to win. Alec Bedser (14 not out) had nothing to lose and struck out with the bat before Doug Wright (2) succumbed to Johnston and England were out for 150.\nResult.\n\"The remarkable part about the finish of this game was that Hassett and his fellow-Australians left the ground in complete silence. There was not the slightest evidence of jubilation at Australia's second victory of the rubber. Everybody, it seemed, wanted England to win.\"\nAustralia won the Second Test at Melbourne by 28 runs to take a 2–0 lead in the series. It was the closest result in an Ashes Test since England's 12 run win at Adelaide in 1928–29. Once again the dismal performance of the Australian batsmen and the tight finish rebounded to England's credit. The all-round performance of Freddie Brown, who top-scored with 62 and took his best Test return of 4/26, proved that he wasn't a passenger in the England team. The Australians had the more consistent batting and a strong bowling attack, but it was Len Hutton's dismissal in the first innings that most saw as the deciding point of the Test.\nThird Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\n\"Because of a traffic jam I was outside the ground on the first day of the Test when the captains tossed. There was a terrific roar. \"I take it,\" said the traffic policeman as I passed him, \"that Brown has won the toss. Good on him. He deserves it.\"\"\nEngland now had to win the final three Tests if they wanted to regain the Ashes, for which the only precedent was when Don Bradman made three big centuries in the 1936–37 Ashes series to win 3–2 after being 2–0 down to Gubby Allen's England side. Sydney is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the MCC had seen many runs for few wickets. In the New South Wales game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with Len Hutton making 150 and Reg Simpson 259 and the fast-medium bowler John Warr took 4/67. As a result the unhappy Brian Close was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and England went into the Test with Doug Wright as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of Freddie Brown and Denis Compton. The leg-spinner Eric Hollies had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and off-spinner Bob Berry was going for 4 runs an over in his containment role and were not chosen. Denis Compton was fit again and replaced the ailing John Dewes, but Gilbert Parkhouse stayed in the team thanks to his fighting 28 at Melbourne and 92 against New South Wales. Australia kept the same team from the Second Test, though if they had lost the performances of a few of them would have resulted in their being dropped. For the only time in Lindsay Hassett's career as captain he lost the toss in an Ashes Test and Freddie Brown was able to bat first on another flat batting track.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"Miller, in one spirited over, altered the whole course of the game. With the third ball of that eventful over he trapped Hutton with his legs in front of the wicket trying to defend against an inswinger which moved in late. The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well under the control of the batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone...with the sixth ball of the over Compton played-on before he had opened his score. The seventh and eighth balls did everything else but put paid to Parkhouse's account. Miller deserved every bit of the thunderous applause which the big crowd handed him when the over was completed.\"\nBrown dispensed with the experiment of having Hutton bat down the order and the old Roses opening partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook went to the crease. Hutton was full of confidence, 19 runs came off the first three overs and Keith Miller asked for a new ball in the fourth. Umpire Elphinstone examined the ball and changed it for a new one, which he ground into the dust to take the shine off. Hutton insisted on a look and bounced on the grass a few times so that it would lose its shape. It made no difference as another 8 runs came of the next two overs and Miller was taken off, only to take a diving catch off Ian Johnson (3/94) to dismiss Washbrook. Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; \"He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot. I ran across before he played it, flung out my hand and held the ball. I was just as astonished as Cyril\". Hutton (62) and Simpson (49) took the score to 128/1 when Miller was brought back on to bowl one of his most famous overs. He bowled a \"super ball\" to dismiss Hutton lbw and bowled Denis Compton for a duck when the ball clipped the edge of the bat and ricocheted into the stumps. Gilbert Parkhouse survived until tea, but Reg Simpson guided another ball from Miller to Sam Loxton at short-fine-leg and England were 137/4. The popular Freddie Brown strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit Bill Johnston to the fence, lofted Lindwall into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto Umpire Barlow's foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the Welshman pulled Ian Johnson to Arthur Morris at mid-on at 187/5. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who held up one end while Brown scattered the in-field and clouted the Australian bowling round the ground. When he was finally out the next day, playing over a yorker from Ray Lindwall for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for England so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. England was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall bouncer at 263/6 and was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Godfrey Evans struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but Alec Bedser was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and John Warr by Miller (4/37). Bailey returned at 281/8 and tried to bat one-handed before he was caught by Don Tallon of Ian Johnson. Doug Wright joined Evans, but was run out for a duck by his Kent team-mate, tripping over his bat and pulling a muscle as he rushed home and England were all out for 290.\nAustralia – First Innings.\n\"Brown had only himself and John Warr to bowl along with Bedser, and there began a performance that for sheer determination and willingness to work must stand unrivalled in Test history, for it was essential that runs should be kept down as well as wickets taken...\"\nThe England bowling attack was badly depleted, Trevor Bailey was unfit to play and did not field and the leg-spinner Doug Wright, who might have been a real handful on the turning Sydney wicket, played for only a few overs before retiring. The bowling thus fell heavily on the shoulders of Alec Bedser, the 40-year-old captain Freddie Brown and debutant John Warr. They had no regular spinner and would have to rely on Brown's part-time leg-spin, the left-arm unorthodox spin of the injured Denis Compton and the comedy leg-breaks of Len Hutton. In the end Compton only bowled 6 overs and Hutton none; the bowling was completed by Bedser (43–4–107–4), Warr (36–4–142–0) and Brown (44–4–153–4), bowling eight-ball overs. The innings began with John Warr bowling to Ken Archer as Arthur Morris always batted second and his nemesis Alec Bedser bowled him with the first ball of the second over. Although Neil Harvey had made 74, 12, 42 and 31 batting at number 3 Lindsay Hassett finally saw that the left-handed strokemaker would fare better further down the order and came in himself. With rain expected over the weekend Brown set defensive fields and with the England fielding on top form Archer (44 not out) and Hassett (62 not out) slowly batted out the day for 110/1 despite the constant barracking of the crowd, who shouted \"Get on with it!\". There was rain on the rest day, but most of it avoided the ground and it rolled out well. When play resumed the wicket took a lot of pace and bounce from the ball and England were doomed to a long day in the field. Even so Godfrey Evans took a brilliant catch off a leg-glance by Archer (48) off Bedser, who was involved in the first 6 wickets to fall. Brown bowled a leg-spinner that fizzed off the pitch and beat Hassett (70) and missed the stumps, but his next ball the Australian captain hit a catch to Bedser at mid-on and his team was 122/3. The presence of Neil Harvey and Keith Miller at the crease against a depleted bowling attack would usually ensure a flow of runs, but while Harvey hit 39 in 79 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, Miller nudged his way at the funeral rate of 24 runs an hour. Sam Loxton survived a close run out when Cyril Washbrook brilliantly threw down his stumps, but was out for 17 when he hoisted a long hop from Brown into the hands of Bedser, who then caught Don Tallon lbw for 18. At 252/6 Australia were still 38 runs behind when Ian Johnson came to the crease and started to hit the ball around in his top Test score of 77, he added 150 with Miller in the highest seventh wicket stand for Australia since Clem Hill and Hugh Trumble made 165 at Melbourne in 1897–98. They took Australia past 300 and 400 for the first time in the series and Miller reached his century after 274 minutes. Brown bowled Johnson, had Lindwall lbw and had Australia 406/8. With the tail now in Miller lifted Warr for six, but ran out Bill Johnston and Jack Iverson to end the innings with his then highest Test score of 145 not out. He had taken Australia to 426 and gave them a lead of 136.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n\"When a bowler of Jack Iverson's ability to control direction and length can spin the ball so far as that, no batsman is likely to give him trouble. I am certain that no batsman of my time, English or Australian, could have held the fort on this pitch against accurate spin-bowling.\"\nLen Hutton and Cyril Washbrook started the innings in fine form against the fast bowlers, who struggled to make the ball lift on the unresponsive wicket. Lindsay Hassett soon took the off and brought on the spinners. Jack Iverson had not bowled in the first innings and with his negligible ability with the bat and in the field some thought he was due to be dropped. It was soon apparent that he was in complete control of the situation, his line and length were flawless and he was turning the ball from outside the off-stump past the leg-stump. He had Hutton out for 9, the ball was snicked behind, where the wicket-keeper Don Tallon knocked it to Ian Johnson in the slips who juggled the ball and dropped it, upon which Tallon dived across and took the catch. Reg Simpson showed his usual bad form against spinners and was caught behind for a duck (even though Tallon did not appeal) and Washbrook was bowled for 34 after hitting two boundaries off Johnson. England were now 45/3 and Iverson had taken 3/2. Denis Compton avoided his pair and held out for 104 minutes making 23, his highest score of a terrible series, before running out Gilbert Parkhouse for 18 and popping a catch to the hungry Ian Johnson off Bill Johnston (1/31). Evans whacked 14 runs with 3 fours before Johnson (1/32) bowled him. Trevor Bailey bravely came out to bat with one hand in plaster, much to the surprise of his captain who asked \"What are the devil are you doing here, Trevor?\", Bailey replied \"I thought I would hold them up for a bit Skipper\" and held up one end with his 0 not out. Iverson bowled Brown, Bedser and Warr to finish with 6/27 and as Doug Wright was absent hurt and England were out for 123.\nResult.\n\"Brown and Bedser deserved at least two-day's rest – but the whole English side was in and out while the sun was still shining. One of the saddest sights I have seen on a cricket field was the weary Bedser trudging out to bat less than two hours after his marathon bowling effort...Bailey batted one handed and Wright did not bat. It was a sickening blow for the Englishmen, to lose by an innings after such heroic efforts by the bowlers, but Iverson was just too good.\"\nAustralia won the Third Test at Sydney by an innings and 13 runs to win the series 3–0 and retain the Ashes. The victory was marred by the injuries that had crippled the England bowling attack and their depressingly slow run-rate. The England bowlers received great praise for their sterling efforts, but the hero was a \"35-year-old flip-bowler, Jack Iverson, who, until he had played in the Brisbane Test, had never seen a Test played\" Brown sent a telegram to Lord's requesting two new bowlers to replace Bailey and Wright and the fast-medium seamer Brian Statham and off-spinner Roy Tattersall of Lancashire were flown out. Unfortunately, he did not ask for a fresh batsman as the England batting could well have used the presence of Bill Edrich. As it was he went to Adelaide with too many bowlers that he couldn't use and few batsmen he could trust.\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\nPreliminaries.\n\"It was one of the poorest Test matches in technique and spirit that I have witnessed. It lacked virility from birth. The Australians came to it with no great spirit of adventure or relish after the Ashes had been won. The policy was, after winning the toss, to hold tight and let the pitch and the Englishmen go to pieces. What went to pieces, of course, was the game itself.\"\nAlthough Australia had wrapped up the Ashes there was still considerable interest in the series as many felt that Freddie Brown's team deserved a win for all their efforts. Since the Third Test they had won four games on the trot by 9 wickets, 10 wickets, an innings and 25 runs and 152 runs and morale was as high as it had ever been. After his dismal showing at Sydney the Australian vice-captain Arthur Morris asked to be dropped, he had been dismissed four times out of five by Alec Bedser (for 25, 0, 2 and 0) and was nicknamed \"Bedser's Bunny\". The selectors declined and instead dropped Sam Loxton after 11 consecutive Tests and brought in Jim Burke of New South Wales to strengthen the lower order batting. Loxton was an outstanding fielder and was still brought to Adelaide as 12th man. Roy Tattersall of Lancashire had been flown out as a replacement for the injured Doug Wright and was picked for his debut. This young off-spinner had topped the tables in 1950 with 193 wickets (13.59), including twenty 5-wicket hauls and six 10-wicket hauls. The England players had been singing his praises since they arrived in Australia, so there was much curiosity about him down under. Doug Wright's pulled leg-muscle has recovered and he would also play and Tattersall replaced Trevor Bailey, whose broken thumb had not yet mended. Gilbert Parkhouse was dropped and replaced by his fellow amateur David Sheppard and despite taking 0/142 at Sydney John Warr was kept in the team. The Adelaide Oval was notorious for being the flattest wicket in Australia, but had taken spin from the first morning in the tour match when the MCC (211 &amp; 220) beat South Australia (126 &amp; 153) by 152 runs. Even so when Lindsay Hassett won the toss he made the easy decision to bat first.\nAustralia – First Innings.\n\"Morris had become very fed up of hearing Bedser's name. He sat that morning at No. 13 table in the hotel dining-room and gave a shudder when he saw it – but decided to sit tight. This, then, was a happy day for him. he had come back to the ranks of Test batsmen again.\"\nThe first Australian wicket fell before a run was on the board for the third time in the series, but it was Ken Archer who succumbed to Alec Bedser when he glanced the third ball of the day to Denis Compton at short fine-leg, though he hung about the wicket even after he was given out by Umpire Barlow. Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the Adelaide Oval was up to its usual standards. Arthur Morris batted a very careful and composed innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as \"Bedser's Bunny\" to rest. He made 206 out of Australia's 371 before he was the last man out, spending 7 hours and 42 minutes at the crease and striking 23 boundaries in the process. He passed 2,000 runs in Tests and made his seventh Ashes century in four years, overtaking Victor Trumper and Bill Woodfull placing him behind only Sir Donald Bradman on the list of Australian century-makers against England. No other Australian batsman made 50, but he added 95 runs for the second wicket with Lindsay Hassett (43), 110 for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (44) and 76 for the fourth wicket with Keith Miller (44). Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by Roy Tattersall (3/95). The young Lancashire off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow E.W. Swanton's boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant Jim Burke with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled Don Tallon, getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders. Alec Bedser returned figures of 3/74, but Hassett protected Morris early in his innings and Miller hit his first over of the second day for 15. Doug Wright took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but John Warr (0/63) could still not take a wicket.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"The Yorkshireman was magnificent. This was not perhaps an innings to be compared with his Brisbane classic, but it was, nevertheless, batsmanship sublime, worth first a hundred and then 150, with off drives, late cuts, hooks and leg glances, all performed with that easy composure so completely the Yorkshireman's own.\"\nEngland's innings – like Australia's – revolved around their opener, in this case Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891–92. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved the ball to the leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\n\"M.C.C. captain Freddie Brown, and a joint manager of the team, Brigadier M. A. Green, were injured in a car accident on North Terrace, city, last night. Brigadier Green was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a semi-conscious condition, suffering from a probable fractured nose, and Brown was treated for cuts to the head and left knee. Brown, who had four stitches inserted in his left knee and two in his head, is reported to have said soon after the accident that he would play today. Doctors at the hospital, however, think it is doubtful, because he will be suffering from stiffness. Brown told the police that he was driving along North Terrace when he swerved to avoid another car. In doing so he crashed head-on into a tram standard in the middle of the road.\"\nAustralia now had three and a half days to set England an unreachable target and bowl them out. Ken Archer ran a four off Alec Bedser in the first over and Arthur Morris struck two boundaries off Doug Wright when he replaced John Warr in the sixth over. Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from David Sheppard. Lindsay Hassett was almost bowled first ball, but survived and Australia were 34/1 at stumps. Archer (32) and Hassett (31) returned in the morning to take the score along to 95/3, but it was Neil Harvey (68), Keith Miller (99) and debutant Jim Burke (101 not out) who put the match beyond doubt. Harvey and Miller ran the bowling ragged and added 99 for the fourth wicket until Harvey was bowled by Brown (1/14) and Miller chopped a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Doug Wright (2/109) and Roy Tattersall (1/116) were heavily punished and Bedser (0/62) was wicketless. Australia ended the fourth day 384 runs ahead and that evening Freddie Brown and Brigadier Green were hospitalised after a car crash returning from dinner with Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia. A car had pulled out suddenly from a side street and Brown swerved into a post for holding electric tram lines. Brown left the hospital early in the morning, but was unfit to play and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional captain to lead England since Jack Hobbs when Arthur Carr was injured in 1924–25. He was unable to prevent Jim Burke from making a Test century on debut, the ninth Australian to do so (compared to 10 Englishmen at the time). John Warr took his first and only Test wicket when Ian Johnson cut the ball to Evans, who knocked it up on the first attempt then ran forward to catch it on the rebound. Umpire Cocks took so long to make a decision that Johnson walked (almost unheard in Australia) to give the long-suffering Warr his first Test wicket and a bowling average of 281.00, the highest by an England bowler. The 12th man Sam Loxton was sent out by Hassett to tell Burke that he could take all the time he wanted over his hundred and the dour stock clerk reached his target after 245 minutes at the crease. Hassett then declared at 403/8 to give England a day and a half to make 503 to win.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n\"John in fact in these two Tests took one for 281, which caused a few of us thereafter childishly to hum in his presence the Ancient and Modern Hymn number 281, 'Lead us Heavenly Father, lead us', with emphasis on the lines \"Lone and Dreary, Faint and Weary, Through the Desert thou did'st go.\" In fact, of course, it was J.J. Warr's prime virtue was that he never seemed either faint or weary, on the field or off. Laughter was seldom far away when he was about...\"\nNo team has ever made 500 runs to win a Test, though Len Hutton and Doug Wright had played in the Timeless Test when England made 654/5 chasing 696 to win, but drew the match because they had to catch their boat home. Realistically England could only hope to draw and Len Hutton (45) and Cyril Washbrook (31) added 74 for the first wicket, the highest opening stand of the series. Bill Johnston (4/73) removed them both, Hutton taken by Sam Loxton at short-leg (substituting for Iverson, who twisted his ankle on the ball), who also caught Denis Compton for a duck. In between he had Washbrook lbw and England entered the last day on 114/3. Reg Simpson (61) and David Sheppard (41) batted out the morning in a stand of 91 that lasted 157 minutes. He was also out to Johnston, caught Burke and Miller (3/27) snapped up Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Sheppard for 7 runs to leave them 228/7. Ian Johnson (2/63) had Roy Tattersall caught by Arthur Morris then bowled John Warr without a run being added and as Freddie Brown was absent injured England were out one hour and forty minutes from stumps on the sixth and last day.\nResult.\n\"The South Australian Cricket Association made a presentation to Jim Burke to commemorate his performance in scoring a century in his first Test. In introducing the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, who performed the little ceremony, Mr Roy Middleton, the president, explained that it was the policy of the Association to recognize any outstanding performance carried out on the Adelaide Oval. He recalled to the minds of those present that both Morris and Compton had been honoured similarly four years previously when each of those batsmen had scored a hundred in each innings of the Test played at Adelaide. It was a pleasant thought on the part of the Association, but it was a great pity that they had overlooked Hutton's outstanding performance.\"\nAustralia beat England in the Fourth Test at Adelaide by 274 runs to take a 4–0 lead in the series. It was Australia's 26 consecutive Test without defeat, its 14 without defeat against England and it was England's seventh Test defeat in succession. After the tightly contested First and Second Tests and the crippling injuries in the Third Test this was Australia's most conclusive victory in the series.\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\n\"The tide has turned but it is not yet high tide for England. There must be few people who did not welcome England's victory in the Fifth Test because it broke the monotonous string of Australian victories and sympathy was entirely with Freddie Brown and his men for the gallant performances they had put up throughout the tour.\"\nGoing into the final Test England dropped the luckless John Warr in favour of Trevor Bailey and Freddie Brown has recovered enough for him to retain his place as captain. The Australian selectors declined to use the game to test some new players and kept their team except to drop Ken Archer in favour of debutant Graeme Hole. Jim Burke was promoted to open the innings with Arthur Morris, even though he had failed as Morris' opening partner for New South Wales and had found success only as a middle order batsman. The players returned to Melbourne – scene of the Second Test – as in those days Sydney and Melbourne alternated having two Tests in the Ashes series. Ian Johnson played even though he had a foot infection, and was spared from bowling too much by Hassett. There had been thunderstorms in the week before the Test, and the outfield and bowler's run ups were soft. Lindsay Hassett won the toss as a matter of course and Australia batted first.\nAustralia – First Innings.\n\"Iverson, last man in, arrived on the scene with his old battle-axe bat. This bat, which must be one of the strangest ever to make an appearance in a Test match, is bolstered up with a solid slab of leather bound firmly round the blade. It has the colour of a very old violin. Its handle is so pliable that it can be twisted in all directions. It must have seen its best days when its owner was a little boy at school. It has been a scrap-heap job for years. But Iverson seldom places much strain upon it.\"\nJim Burke provided the customary early wicket to fall, caught by Roy Tattersall at forward short-leg off Alec Bedser after he swopped ends with Trevor Bailey. Regardless of his recent double-century at Adelaide Morris (50) \"mistimed, misjudged and mishit\", but managed to stay in as he and captain Lindsay Hassett (92) slowly increased the Australian innings. They were barracked heavily by the small crowd of 7,000 (in a stadium capable of holding 80,000) who wanted them to make way for the strokemakers Neil Harvey and Keith Miller. Their quality only became apparent when Morris was lbw to Brown at 111/2, closely followed by Harvey caught behind on 114/3 and Miller caught-and-bowled on 123/4 to give the England captain a spell of 3/0. The crowd increased to 20,000 as news of the England success traveled during the day and people came into see the fun. Hassett continued to hold the innings together, but Bedser worked his way through the line-up, bowling Graeme Hole and catching Ian Johnson lbw. Len Hutton took an excellent catch off Brown to dismiss the Australian captain 8 runs short of his century and another off Bedser to dispose of Don Tallon. Ray Lindwall (21) and Bill Johnston (12 not out) led a small fight back to get Australia from 187/8 to 206/8 at stumps and not for the first time England had the advantage on the first day. The injury-prone Trevor Bailey had fallen heavily when bowling and an X-ray over the weekend found that he had chipped a bone in his foot, but he came back to play. The second day was lost to heavy rain and fears of another Brisbane-like sticky rose, but the pitch dried out on the Sunday and flattened out nicely when pressed by the big electric roller on the Monday. Bedser (5/46) had Lindwall caught by Compton in second slip and Brown (5/49) had Iverson caught by Washbrook in the covers and the Australian innings closed on 217. It was Brown's best bowling and his only five-wicket haul in Tests.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"It was interesting to see the crowd's reaction to the English last-wicket partnership. They cheered every scoring shot and went into ecstasy over Tattersall's efforts. It was quite obvious that they had decided to fight the battle out for England and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and I am one of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging. These were the people who cheered the tenth-wicket partnership to the echo.\"\nThe old firm of Hutton and Washbrook opened for England and added 40 runs in 32 minutes for the first wicket before Washbrook tickled a ball from Keith Miller into the gloves of Don Tallon. Brown thought that if the Australian bowling was attacked they would buckle under and England would get more runs, in any case Hutton hit 8 boundaries in his 79 and added 131 runs with Reg Simpson in 142 minutes, the only century stand of the series for England . With Hutton in fine form the Notts opener was able to play himself in and at 171/1 the English batsmen were in finally in control. In desperation Hassett brought on debutant Graeme Hole to try out his off-spinners and to everyone's surprise his fourth ball clean bowled the England opener and the Australian bowling attack took an interest in affairs again. Lindwall (3/77) and Miller (4/76) bowled with greater speed and hostility than at any time in the series and by stumps England were 218/6 with Compton, Sheppard, Brown and Evans all gone and Simpson (80 not out) left with Alec Bedser (3 not out). Lindwall bowled Bedser for 11 and Jack Iverson (2/40) disposed of Trevor Bailey and Doug Wright to bring last man Roy Tattersall in at 246/9 with England just 18 runs ahead. With Simpson on 92 the main concern was whether he would reach 100 on this his 31st birthday, but this was soon resolved when he hit 11 runs off his next over from Miller. Hassett spread out the field to allow Simpson to take singles so they could concentrate on Tattersall, who was surrounded with close fielders. The young Lancastrian kept a straight bat and Simpson cracked 6 fours as they hit 50 runs in the 34 minutes before lunch. Miller bowled Tattersall for 10 after the break and Simpson was left on 156 not out, his highest score in Tests and his greatest Test innings. Their stand added 74 runs in 55 minutes and took England to 320, their only score of the series over 300, and a lead of 103 runs.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\n\"Bedser was given a wonderful ovation when he came off the field with five more wickets to his name, and a match record of 10 for 105 – just one more instance of proof furnished by the Surrey man that on Australian wickets he is the world's outstanding pace bowler.\"\nAustralian hopes that they could set England a good target received an immediate double blow as Alec Bedser sent Morris and Burke straight back to the pavilion. Lindsay Hassett and Neil Harvey salvaged a stand of 81 from the wreckage of 6/2, with Harvey swashbuckling his way to 52 in what Bill O'Reilly thought was his best innings of the series. He was torpedoed by a shooter from Doug Wright (3/56) and Freddie Brown (1/32) caught and bowled Keith Miller for a duck to leave them 89/4. Hassett found another partner in Graeme Hole and saw out the day at 129/4, but was skittled in the morning for 48 – Doug Wright's 100th test wicket – when a leg-spinner zipped one past his bat and toppled his off-stump. Wright finally showed why he was so feared on the county circuit when Ian Johnson lofted a googly to Brown at mid-off. Australia were now 142/6, a mere 39 runs ahead, but Hole stood steady for three hours making 63 until he was bowled by Trevor Bailey (1/32). Brown figured that if anybody deserved some easy wickets it was Bedser and the big Surrey bowler removed Lindwall, Johnston and Iverson for five runs and ending his superb tour with 5/59, 10/105 in the match. His 30 wickets (16.06) was the most by an English bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n\"Not once, but three times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab souvenirs of an historic occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a full toss down the leg side and took it for granted that Compton would hit the ball to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.\"\nEngland needed 95 runs to win and \"an earthquake would not have shaken Hutton's determination not to be out when until victory was gained\". he made 60 not out, his fifth innings over 50 and fourth unbeaten innings of the series and hit the winning runs. Washbrook (7) and Simpson (15) did not last the pace, but Denis Compton finally had some luck as he made 11 not out. Lindsay Hassett bowled the last over with the fielders crowded round the batsman, not in the hope of a catch, but so they could fight Don Tallon and the umpire for souvenir stumps and bails. They jumped the gun twice, once when Hassett bowled a rank full toss down the leg side, expecting Denis Compton to sweep it to the boundary, so did the umpire who called no ball and grabbed two stumps, Hassett the other and Tallon three, but the Compton missed, Tallon dropped his stumps as he jumped on the ball and they had to start again. The next ball was a single, then with one run to win Hutton amused himself by smothering a full toss amidst the chaos. Play was held up until Ian Johnson returned a bail he had hidden in his pocket. Finally, Compton pulled a stump out the ground and ran down the wicket as Hutton pushed the ball wide of square-leg and trotted over the crease to be congratulated by Hassett while Tallon fought off the close fielders for the stumps. The English batsmen were cheered off the pitch and they shouted for Brown to give them a speech, which he did, giving particular thanks to Len Hutton and Alec Bedser. The team repaired to their hotel for toasts of Champagne \"To England – and to Freddie Brown\" and to read the congratulatory telegrams that poured in from all over the world.\nResult.\nEngland beat Australia by 8 wickets, but still lost the series 4–1. It was the first Test England had won since the First Test vs the West Indies at Old Trafford in 1950, having lost the 7 intervening Tests. It was their first victory over Australia since the Fifth Test at the Oval in 1938, 15 Tests previously. The only survivors were Len Hutton and Denis Compton, the batsmen at the wicket when the winning runs were scored, and Lindsay Hassett, who bowled the final over. It was the first Test Australia had lost since the Oval in 1938 and ended their run of 26 Tests and 96 games in all cricket without defeat.\n1950–51 Test series averages.\nSource As was the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if used at all. The Australians were all amateurs until the Packer Revolution, even though they played like professionals. Jack Iverson in his only Test series took 21 wickets (15.23), giving him the 10th lowest bowling average of those who have taken 10 or more Test wickets. Len Hutton's batting average (88.83) was double that of every other batsmen in the series. Keith Miller (43.75) topped the Australian batting averages, the lowest average to do so by an Australian since the 1911–12 Ashes series when Sidney Barnes and Frank Foster ran riot. Only five centuries were made in the series, the lowest in an Ashes series since 1920–21. England's 10th wicket stands produced 195 runs (32.50), better than for any other England wicket, except the 2nd, which made 412 runs (45.78).\nThe press corps.\nThe 1950–51 cricket press corps presented a formidable team in its own right; Sid Barnes, Dick Whitington, John Kay, Jack Fingleton, Vivian Jenkins, Arthur Mailey, Harold Larwood, Evelyn Wellings, Bert Oldfield, Bill Bowes, Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett. They played several games on the tour against minor teams and schools, including a Christmas Eve charity match against Bill Ponford's XI which presented £1,000 to a nursing charity and games against schoolboy teams in Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The radio commentators included the Australian captain Vic Richardson and Arthur Gilligan the popular England captain of the 1924–25 Ashes series. Gilligan's \"What do you think, Vic?\" was inevitably followed by Richardson's \"I dunno, what do you think, Arthur?\", which became an Australian catchphrase."

        "title": "History of the FIBA Basketball World Cup",
        "text": "The history of the FIBA Basketball World Cup began in 1950, with the first FIBA Basketball World Cup, which was the 1950 FIBA World Championship. The FIBA Basketball World Cup is an international basketball competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1950 (the 1958 tournament was postponed to 1959 and did not get back on its current schedule until the 1970 tournament was held three years after the 1967 tournament).\nThe tournament was conceived during the 1948 Summer Olympics when FIBA leaders, seeing how successful the Olympic basketball tournament had become, wanted to hold a Championship every four years between Olympiads. The first tournament was held in 1950 in Argentina and was won by the hosts. The tournament was later dominated from 1963 through 1998 by Brazil, the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United States, and Yugoslavia (and later Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro), as those four teams won every medal in that era. Since 2002, however, parity has seen new teams claim medals as basketball continues to grow throughout the world.\nThe tournament was restricted to European and South American professional players for the first forty years of its existence. In 1989, FIBA made the decision to allow NBA players for future tournaments. Starting in 1994, NBA players have played in each Basketball World Cup.\nBackground.\nThe first international basketball tournament took place in South America in 1930, some forty years after Dr. James Naismith invented the game.\nThe International Amateur Basketball Federation (better known by its French acronym FIBA) was founded two years later with founding members Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, and Switzerland. In 1935, Europe held its first continental championship; based on the success of the event, basketball was introduced as an outdoor game for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.\nThe 1936 tournament was largely a success, drawing 21 teams from five continents (excluding Spain and Hungary, who withdrew just prior to the competition), the largest of any team competition. The United States, Canada, and Mexico took the three podium spots. The tournament was not without its faults, as FIBA attempted to impose two last-minute rules. The first, that no player could be taller than was rejected after the United States (the only team with players over that stature) objected because half of their team would have been ineligible. The second, that only seven players could suit up for each game, was passed. Players also complained about the basketball, which was lighter than most players were used to and tended to get tossed about in the wind. Finally, the final turned into a sloppy affair held in a driving rainstorm on a clay tennis court; the United States won over Canada 19–8 in what was the lowest scoring game of the tournament (future events were moved indoors because of the disastrous weather). Despite the storm and the lack of any seating, 1,000 fans showed up for the final, and basketball was kept on the Olympic program for future years.\nAlthough the European Basketball Championship was put on hold between 1939 and 1946 because of World War II, the South American Basketball Championship was held every year between 1937 and 1945. Following the war years, basketball continued to grow in popularity; the 1947 European Basketball Championship drew a record fourteen teams. Basketball was again part of the Olympics in 1948. Despite the continued dominance of the gold medal-winning American team, the tournament was a resounding success, drawing 23 nations that were evenly disbursed around the world (eight from Europe, five from South America, five from Asia, four from North America, and one from Africa), though defending European champions Soviet Union did not take part in the event.\nWith the successful Olympic tournament taking place in the background, the FIBA Congress met in London in 1948. At the urging of FIBA Secretary-General Renato William Jones, FIBA decided to organize a World Championship tournament every four years between the Olympics. The first tournament was to be held in 1950. Argentina was nominated to host for three major reasons – first, European countries were still recovering from the War and none had expressed interest in hosting; second, Argentina had a positive image in the international basketball community and were a founding member of FIBA; finally, and probably most importantly, they were willing to take on the unenviable task of hosting the first World Championship. FIBA decided to invite ten teams – the hosts Argentina, the medalists from the 1948 Olympics (the United States, France, and Brazil), plus two teams each from South America, Europe, and Asia.\nHistory.\nEarly Years, South American dominance (1950–1963).\nLike the first FIFA World Cup twenty years before, the first World Championship in 1950 experienced severe growing pains. The most prominent concern was teams' unwillingness to participate: South American champion Uruguay refused to make the short trip to Buenos Aires after Argentinian immigration officials refused to grant visas to members of the Uruguayan press. South American runner-up Brazil had already qualified by finishing third at the 1948 Olympics, so the two South American berths fell to third and fourth placed teams Chile and Peru. As no Asian team wanted to make the long trip to Argentina, FIBA invited European champion Egypt and Ecuador. None of the stronger European teams wanted to make the journey either, so Europe was represented by Yugoslavia (which had finished 13th in their only European Championship appearance in 1947) and Spain (which had not participated in a European Championship since 1935). All three Olympic medalists participated, although the United States did not take the tournament particularly seriously and sent a team of factory workers from a Denver, Colorado Chevrolet plant, rather than holding tryouts. France, meanwhile, returned only two players from their Olympic silver medalist team.\nTwo more unfortunate incidents took place on the court: First, Yugoslavia refused to stand for the anthem of Franco's Spain in the ninth place game before walking off the court, forfeiting the game and receiving a nine-month ban from FIBA for their actions. Second, a refereeing error gave Egypt a preliminary round win over France; when Egypt refused to replay the game, France appealed, threatening the schedule of the tournament. Fortunately, the French withdrew their protest and the tournament proceeded as scheduled.\nThe 1950 tournament also had bright spots, most coming from the home team. Argentina, which had finished 15th in the previous Olympics, kept the same team together in what amounted to a two-year training camp for the team, including six-hour practices every day for the three months directly preceding the tournament. It paid off, as the Argentines beat the top-seeded Americans in the final, the first ever loss for the United States in international competition. An overflow crowd of 25,000 fans packed into Luna Park in Buenos Aires to watch the final between Argentina and the United States.\nIn 1954, the World Championship returned to South America, this time held in Brazil. Originally scheduled to be held in São Paulo to celebrate the city's 400th anniversary, the tournament was moved to Rio de Janeiro's Maracanãzinho stadium after the la Palais des Sports in São Paulo was damaged in a storm. Once again, the majority of teams (seven of twelve) were from the Americas, though defending champion Argentina did not participate for political reasons. Europe was represented by France, Israel, and Yugoslavia. Although each of the three European teams had made improvements, finishing in the top six at EuroBasket 1953, the strongest teams from the Eastern Bloc all refused to participate for the second straight tournament. Israel's appearance in the tournament caused Egypt to withdraw in protest; they were not replaced in the draw. Asia made its first appearance in the tournament, represented by Formosa (Taiwan) and the Philippines. The Philippines impressed in the tournament, finishing with a bronze medal, still the highest finish for any Asian team in the tournament. The United States took the tournament more seriously this time, sending three-time AAU champions Peoria Caterpillars. The Americans cruised to an undefeated 9–0 record, winning each game by an average of more than 25 points, including a 21-point victory over previously unbeaten Brazil in the final. Once again, attendance was impressive for the final, as a still-standing record 35,000 watched the final at Maracanãzinho.\nAlthough the 1959 tournament was again dominated by teams from the Americas, the Eastern Bloc finally made its first appearance, with EuroBasket 1957 champion Soviet Union and runner-up Bulgaria participating in the tournament for the first time. The tournament was originally scheduled for 1958, but was moved to January 1959 after delays in the construction of Metropolitan Indoor Stadium. Money previously dedicated to the arena was instead dished out to football stadiums throughout the country after Chile was awarded the 1962 FIFA World Cup. This caused the tournament to move outdoors to the Estadio Nacional de Chile, which was converted from a football to a basketball stadium for the occasion. In a precedent that would continue until the 1982 FIBA World Championship, the host team was given a bye into the final round of the tournament. The tournament was briefly threatened when the United States first declined the invitation because the postponed tournament was scheduled in the middle of the NCAA and AAU seasons. After FIBA told the Americans that this would ruin the competition, the U.S. relented and sent a team from the United States Air Force. The Soviet Union impressed in its matchup with the second-rate American team, dominating in a 62–37 victory witnessed by 30,000 fans, a FIBA record for non-final games. Still, the European champion Soviets were beatable, as evidenced by a preliminary round defeat to Canada. Despite the loss, the Soviet Union seemed well on their way to gold; a victory over Formosa in the final round robin game (there were no playoffs at the tournament) would have given them the gold.\nCold War politics intervened, however, as the Soviets refused to take the court against Formosa because of their support to the People's Republic of China (Bulgaria did the same, although they were out of medal contention by that point). The Soviet Union and Bulgaria were relegated to the last two places in the final round. Brazil eventually took their first gold medal, avenging their loss five years previous in an 81–67 victory over the Americans in what proved to be the deciding game. Bulgaria and the Soviet Union's demotions pleased the home crowd, as Chile was promoted to the bronze medal position.\nPolitics reared its head again at the 1963 FIBA World Championship. The event was awarded to Manila, Philippines in what was to be the first tournament held outside South America. However, the Philippine government refused to give visas to the socialist countries (Soviet Union and Yugoslavia). The tournament was instead moved back to Brazil for the second time in three tournaments. Rio de Janeiro again hosted the final round, and routinely had sellout crowds of more than 25,000. The tournament belonged to the hosts, as Brazil did not lose a game en route to winning its second consecutive world championship. Although the tournament was once again dominated by teams from the Americas (eight of thirteen teams), Europe grabbed its first medals with Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union claiming the silver and bronze, respectively. The United States team, although later deemed \"inferior\" by FIBA, was still composed of the same AAU, college, and armed forces players that won the gold medal at the 1963 Pan American Games just weeks before. Despite this, the Americans had three losses to finish in fourth place, the first time they failed to win a medal at the tournament.\nEuropean Dominance (1967–1982).\nThe 1967 FIBA World Championship was held in South America for the fifth consecutive time, this time in Montevideo, Uruguay. The 1967 tournament ushered in a new era in the World Championship – it was the first all-European final and the first tournament that had a qualification process, albeit an informal one. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Italy qualified by finishing in the top four at EuroBasket 1965; Japan grabbed the Asian qualifier spot by winning the 1965 ABC Championship; and Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and Chile qualified by finishing in the top four at the 1966 South American Basketball Championship. They were joined by hosts Uruguay and North American teams USA, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, which had no formal qualification process. Israel was also invited, but declined the participation. Chile likewise elected not to participate and were replaced by fellow South American side Paraguay. For the first time, a European team won the tournament, as the Soviet Union finished the round robin final round in first place despite an early 59–58 loss to the United States. Yugoslavia, Brazil, and the United States each finished at 4–2, with Yugoslavia taking the silver and Brazil the bronze based on their head-to-head results. The United States once again sent a hodgepodge team, assembling for the first time only ten days before the tournament. The hosts Uruguay were embarrassed in multiple ways – they finished last in the final round after going only 1–5 in the tournament, and games were hosted in \"The Cylinder\", a massive steel and concrete structure that required blankets and electric heaters for the players when temperatures inside dropped to . Starting with this tournament, the Naismith Trophy was awarded to the tournament champion.\nThe 1970 FIBA World Championship became the first to be held outside South America when Yugoslavia was awarded the event. The host position proved valuable for the Yugoslav team, as they won the gold medal after finishing with the silver medal for two consecutive tournaments. The 1970 tournament was notable as the first time that the champions of Oceania and Africa were given automatic berths in the tournament. The Asian champion was given an automatic berth for the second time. The chasm between the established basketball nations in the Americas and Europe and the developing nations in Asia, Oceania, and Africa became apparent when Korea, Australia, and Egypt (competing as the United Arab Republic) finished 11th, 12th, and 13th of thirteen teams, respectively. Cuba and Panama, the top two teams at the 1969 Centrobasket, also earned berths. Like Australia, Egypt, and Korea, both were knocked out in the group stage, although neither were as badly overmatched, finishing eighth and ninth, respectively. With the new teams, South America's total representatives dipped to two teams, with Brazil and Uruguay representing the continent. Brazil (silver) and the Soviet Union (bronze) medaled for the third straight tournament. The United States, again fielding a team of lesser-known NCAA players, finished a disappointing fifth place, their worst finish so far at a World Championship.\nIn 1974, the tournament moved back to the Western Hemisphere when it was held in basketball-crazy Puerto Rico. The tournament expanded to 14 teams for the first time, with the defending champions being given an automatic berth in the tournament. Both Yugoslavia, the defending champions, and host Puerto Rico were automatically qualified for the final round. Qualification remained the same, with the top three Eurobasket finishers, the top two Centrobasket finishers, the top two South American Basketball Championship finishers, the top two North American teams, and the champions of Africa, Asia, and Oceania each earning berths in the tournament. The developing nations again picked up the rear of the field. African champions Central African Republic particularly struggled, losing 140–48 to the Soviet Union in a preliminary round game that still ranks as the most lopsided defeat in FIBA World Championship history. The 140 points is even more spectacular, considering that FIBA had not yet installed a three-point line. Meanwhile, the United States sent a young and inexperienced, but very talented, team to the World Championship. Led by tournament MVP John Lucas II, the Americans went 8–1, their best result in years, but had to settle for the bronze based on a tiebreaker when the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia finished with identical records. The Soviet Union, boasting five veterans of the 1972 Olympic team that beat the United States for the first time, again defeated the Americans en route to winning the gold medal. Yugoslavia finished with the silver medal, their fourth consecutive podium at the tournament.\nThe 1978 FIBA World Championship was the first held in Asia, with the Philippines hosting the event fifteen years after they were originally scheduled to host the 1963 tournament. Fourteen teams participated in the tournament for the second time, while the qualification again remained the same. The tournament took a slightly different format for this edition; the top eight teams again qualified for a final round robin, but the top two teams after the round robin met in a playoff for the gold medal, while the third and fourth placed teams met for the bronze. The high-powered Yugoslav team scored more than 100 points in eight of their ten group stage games, cruising to an undefeated record. The Soviet Union went 9–1 to finish second and meet Yugoslavia in the gold medal game. The Soviet team held Yugoslavia to its lowest point total of the tournament, but fell 82–81 in a back-and-forth overtime thriller. After scoring a World Championship record 154 points in a preliminary round victory over China, Brazil beat Italy for the bronze medal, the fourth time in the last five years that those three teams had claimed the podium. After sending college players to the previous two World Championships, the United States sent an Athletes in Action squad because the early October schedule interfered with college team preparations. Somewhat predictably, the team struggled to a 6–4 record and a fifth-place finish. Oceania champions Australia improved, qualifying for the final round for the first time, becoming the first team from outside the Americas and Europe to qualify for the final round since the Philippines in 1954 (Philippines also qualified for the final round in this tournament, although they qualified automatically as hosts). Senegal won a game, beating Asian champion China in the consolation round to become the first African champion to win a game since they were given an automatic berth at the World Championship in 1970.\nThe 1982 FIBA World Championship was held in Colombia – a surprising choice given that the squad had never previously qualified for the World Championship. Given an automatic berth in the semifinals, the team predictably was overmatched by the traditional basketball powers and were outscored by 183 points in six games, including a 143–76 loss to the Soviet Union that ranked as the second most points ever given up in the World Championship. Despite Colombia's performance and lack of basketball history, attendance was solid, with a massive public outpouring of support. Qualification changed slightly for this tournament, as the tournament was pared down to thirteen teams for this edition. The United States, plus the winners of Centrobasket, Eurobasket, Oceania Championship, Asian Championship, African Championship, and South American Championship were afforded only one berth each, with the top three finishers at both the Summer Olympics and 1978 World Championship also gaining berths. Italy was scheduled to compete as the silver medalist at the 1980 Summer Olympics, but withdrew and were replaced by fourth-placed finisher Spain. Canada was later given a wildcard berth to the tournament. Once again, the final group stage ended with a gold medal and bronze medal match. After the Athletes in Action debacle of 1978, the United States sent a talented college team led by tournament MVP Doc Rivers. The US team went 5–1 in the final round to qualify for the gold medal match against the Soviet Union. However, the Soviets avenged a group stage loss to the Americans in a thrilling 95–94 victory, as the Americans' last minute jumper fell short. Yugoslavia won its sixth consecutive medal by beating Spain 119–117 in the bronze medal game, while Australia captured fifth place for its best finish to date.\nTournament Expansion and Contraction, the Big Three: Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, the United States (1986–1990).\nThe 1986 FIBA World Championship brought major changes. The tournament expanded to 24 teams for the first time, divided into four preliminary round groups of six teams each. The three top teams in each group then qualified for two six team semifinal round groups before the top two teams in each of those groups met in a four-team single elimination playoff round. Additionally, the three-point line was added for the first time at this tournament. The defending champions Soviet Union and host Spain earned automatic berths; the remaining spots were given to six European teams, two North American teams, three South American teams, three Centrobasket teams, three Asian teams, two African teams, and one Oceanian team. Wild cards were also given out to France and New Zealand. The expansion proved to be questionable, as there were huge disparities between the top and bottom teams. Group D was particularly disastrous, as last place Malaysia, which replaced Asian champion Philippines after they withdrew, were outscored by 226 points, while fourth place New Zealand were outscored by 114 points. Even these numbers were deceptive, as New Zealand only beat Malaysia by two points; in other games, Canada beat the Malaysians by 90 and Yugoslavia beat them by 70. The twelve-team semifinal round proved more competitive. After boycotts in the last two Olympics, the United States saw the World Championship as more prestigious, and sent a college team filled with future NBA players David Robinson, Charles Smith, Kenny Smith, and Muggsy Bogues. The college stars brought home the first World Championship gold for the Americans since 1954, beating the Soviet Union 87–85 in another thrilling gold medal game to avenge their championship game loss four years previous. Yugoslavia beat Brazil to capture a second consecutive bronze after being beat by a point in a semifinal overtime game versus the Soviets. Host Spain again turned in a solid performance, finishing in fifth place four years after finishing in fourth.\nAfter the preliminary round mismatches four years previous, the 1990 FIBA World Championship was trimmed to a sixteen team format that would remain in place until 2006. Like it did in 1950, Luna Park in Buenos Aires hosted the tournament final as FIBA returned to its roots in Argentina. The sixteen teams were divided into four groups of four teams each; the top two teams in each group advanced to the second group stage. The top two teams in each of the second group stage groups then advanced to the single-elimination knockout round. Qualification was again revised as Asia and Africa were given two berths each, and Oceania one. Five teams each qualified from the newly restructured Tournament of Americas (which now included teams from North, Central, and South America) and the Eurobasket tournament. Host Argentina also was given a spot in the tournament. This tournament would be the last to feature Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and both made the most of it, meeting in the gold medal match. Led by Croatian Dražen Petrović and Serbian Vlade Divac, the golden generation of Yugoslav basketball played together for the last time in a major international tournament at the World Championship. The team won the gold medal, beating the Soviet Union 92–75, a fitting end for a country that was soon to break into ethnic war and pit former teammates against each other. The Soviet Union won a silver medal in their last tournament, although they were already weakened on account of the Baltic countries declaring independence in early 1990. Most importantly, the Soviets were without star center Arvydas Sabonis after Lithuania declared independence in March 1990. The United States captured the bronze by beating Puerto Rico 107–105 after trailing by eight points with 1:28 left. Despite not winning a medal, the fourth-place finish was the best finish for the Puerto Ricans in the World Championship. Once again, Asian and African teams struggled, as Angola, Egypt, China, and Korea all finished winless in group play.\nNBA enters the competition, the United States dominates (1994).\nThe 1994 FIBA World Championship, held in Ontario, Canada after original host Belgrade was forced to withdraw on account of the Yugoslav Wars, was full of new sights. In 1989, FIBA made the decision to open up future competitions to NBA players (prior to that only European and South American professionals were allowed to participate), starting with the 1992 Summer Olympics, and at the same time dropped the word \"Amateur\" from its official name. Led by Shaquille O'Neal, Reggie Miller, and Joe Dumars, the United States fielded a team of NBA players, known as the \"Dream Team II.\" Meanwhile, the Soviet Union had broken apart and was succeeded by Russia. The newly structured FR Yugoslavia was prevented from competing by a UN embargo, while former Yugoslav republic Croatia appeared under its own flag for the first time. However, neither Russia, Croatia, or any other team were any match for the United States NBA players, as the Americans cruised to the gold medal, winning every game by an average of 37.7 points per game. In the final, the United States beat Russia 137–91 in a game witnessed by an official World Championship record crowd of 32,616 that was by far the most lopsided final in World Championship history. Only Spain, in the first game of the tournament, was able to put up any sort of resistance against the Americans, losing by only 15. Russia and Croatia took the silver and bronze medals, respectively, in their first tournament. The tournament also saw the first appearance of the reunified Germany, which finished 12th. Asian champions China finished eighth after becoming the first Asian team to qualify for the second group stage in the tournament's new format.\nLockout, Yugoslavia wins the title (1998).\nThe 1998 FIBA World Championship, held in Athens, lost some of its luster when the 1998–99 NBA lockout prevented the American NBA players from participating. Unlike the record crowds that turned out to see the Dream Team II in 1994, no more than a few thousand people watched the Americans' first game, an 83–59 victory over Brazil. The scrappy Americans, made up of college, semi-pro, and overseas players, did manage to exceed expectations and win the bronze medal over the host Greek team. New faces again turned up at the tournament, as former Soviet republic Lithuania made its debut. The most resounding debut, however, belonged to the new look Yugoslavia team, now consisting of the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Despite missing some its best players, Yugoslavia won the gold medal over Russia to pick up where they left off eight years ago.\nParity and Further Expansion, Fall of the United States, Yugoslavia sets a record, Rise of Spain (2002–2006).\nAlthough no one would have guessed at the time, the 2002 FIBA World Championship, held in Indianapolis, ushered in a new era of parity in international basketball. Since 1963, some combination of Brazil, the Soviet Union (and Russia), Yugoslavia (and its post-breakup republics), and the United States had won every medal. With the United States again fielding a team of NBA players, and Russia and EuroBasket 2001 champion Yugoslavia still going strong, no one seriously expected other teams to challenge for medals. In retrospect, the writing was on the wall for the era of dominance for those teams. First, after the United States had dominated every tournament with NBA players since 1992, winning 53 straight international games, many of the top-flight NBA players had lost interest and decided not to participate. Second, Russia's golden generation had passed; the team failed to medal in the 1999 and 2001 EuroBasket tournaments – the first time since the Soviet Union started participating in 1947 that the team had failed to medal in two consecutive European championships. Finally, a new format debuted in 2002, making Cinderella runs more likely. Teams were still divided into four groups of four teams each, but the top three advanced to the next group stage. From there the teams were divided into two groups of six, with the top eight advancing to the eight-team single elimination knockout stage. This made it more likely that the powerhouse teams would not medal, as a loss in the quarterfinal knockout round would send the team to the consolation bracket.\nThis eventually proved to be the case for the United States. After the Americans opened up the tournament 5–0, Argentina stunned the United States in the final second group stage game, opening up a 20-point second quarter lead before hanging on for an 87–80 victory. The Americans could never come all the way back from the deficit, as Argentina ended the 58-game winning streak for the United States in tournaments that NBA players competed in. In the opposite group, Yugoslavia also struggled, finishing third; this set up a quarterfinal match between the two teams, meaning only one of the two favorites would medal. The US was shocked yet again, 81–78, in a game that the US led by as many as ten points. Although Yugoslavia went on to win gold, the US lost again in the consolation bracket to Spain to finish sixth in the tournament. Russia, meanwhile, did not even get out of the second group stage, finishing in tenth place with a 3–5 record. Argentina won the silver medal for its first medal since it won the 1950 tournament, while Germany beat New Zealand for the bronze, its first ever medal. New Zealand's fourth-placed finish was the best for an Oceania team, while African champion Angola and Asian champion China both continued to improve with both qualifying for the second group stage.\nAfter the 2002 FIBA World Championship ushered in a new era of parity, FIBA made the decision to expand the 2006 tournament to 24 teams for the first time since the failed expansion in 1986. In announcing the expansion, FIBA cited the \"increased level of basketball around the world and the increasing number of competitive teams at the highest level.\" FIBA also removed the second group stage; instead, the top four teams in each group of six would move on to a 16-team, single-elimination knockout stage. The host and Olympic champion received automatic berths, while six European teams, four Americas teams, three Asian teams, three African teams, and two Oceanian teams were given berths. Additionally, FIBA reserved four spots for wild-card invitations, which were later given to Serbia and Montenegro, Italy, Puerto Rico, and Turkey. Russia was notably absent for the first time since the Soviet Union began competing in 1959. A record 44 NBA players, signed to fifteen different teams, competed in the event.\nThe expansion experiment was immediately successful this time around, as African, Asian, and Oceanian teams had all improved. On day one of the tournament, African side Nigeria made their World Championship debut by defeating two-time defending champion Serbia and Montenegro in stunning fashion. Although all nine European teams qualified for the eighth finals, they were joined for the first time by two African teams in Angola and Nigeria. China was the only Asian team to advance to the eighth finals, although Lebanon went 2–3 and defeated France in group play before being eliminated on a tiebreaker. Both Australia and New Zealand qualified for the eighth finals as well. FIBA Americas teams suffered the most, as Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela were all sent home early with a combined two wins between them – a stunning development that showed just how far basketball had come in other parts of the world. In the end, Argentina, Greece, Spain, and the United States all finished group play undefeated; because of the new format, the three teams met each other in the semifinals after each won their first two knockout stage games. In the first semifinal, Spain narrowly beat Argentina 75–74 in an ugly defensive struggle to assure their first ever World Championship medal. In the second semifinal, Greece beat another team of NBA players, 101–95, as the US was unable to slow down the Greeks' offense. The final between first-time medalists Spain and Greece turned anticlimactic, as Greece's shooting went cold in a 70–47 victory for the Spanish. The United States recovered to win the bronze medal over Argentina.\nThe United States returns to the top (2010–2014).\nAfter the success of the 2006 tournament, the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey also featured 24 teams. 41 NBA players participated in the tournament. Once again, European teams were the most successful in the early rounds of the tournament; nine of ten European teams advanced to the knockout stage, as only Germany was sent home early after an overtime loss to Angola in group play. Six European teams advanced to the quarterfinals, tying their total from 2006. For the second straight tournament, the United States and Argentina were the only non-European teams to advance to the quarterfinals. Both Oceanian teams were knocked out in the eighth finals for the second straight tournament, as were the lone eighth finalists from Africa (Angola) and Asia (China). Defending World champion, European champion and Olympic silver medalist Spain struggled without star Pau Gasol, losing two of their first three games before Serbia knocked them out in the quarterfinals. Top-ranked Argentina was also knocked out in the quarterfinals. Eventually, the Argentines beat Spain for fifth place in a match that many thought would be for the title. The United States again brought a roster of NBA players, although none of the gold medal-winning 2008 Olympic team returned for the Americans. Instead, the Americans brought a young team, led by 21-year-old Kevin Durant and went undefeated in group play for the second consecutive tournament. Host Turkey and Lithuania, both looking for their first World Championship medal, also finished group play undefeated.\nFor the second straight tournament, all four group winners cruised into the semifinal round, with the USA facing Lithuania and hosts Turkey facing Serbia. The US cruised to a victory over Lithuania while Turkey used last-second heroics from Kerem Tunçeri, whose last-second layup sent Turkey to the final. Turkey became the first host team to reach the final since Yugoslavia in 1970. In the bronze medal game, Lithuania rebounded from their loss to the Americans, beating Serbia to win their first ever World Championship medal. Lithuania's victory, along with Turkey's appearance in the final, meant that first-time medalists have won two medals in each of the last three tournaments. The USA would go on to stop Turkey's Cinderella run in the final, becoming the first team to win four World Championships in the process.\nThe 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup was awarded to Spain, the first time that Europe had hosted consecutive championships. Although currently the tournament is projected to have the same format, FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann held out the prospect that the tournament will expand to 32 teams in a statement during the 2010 tournament. The 2014 newly named FIBA World Cup witnessed USA dominating the tournament and fielding a perfect 9–0 record en route to its record fifth gold medal, led by tournament MVP Kyrie Irving, defeating Serbia 129–92 to capture its second straight gold medal. France defeated Lithuania in the bronze medal game to receive its first ever medal.\nIn 2012, FIBA president Yvan Mainini announced major changes to the competition beyond 2014. The competition calendar will be changed significantly after the 2014 World Cup; in the future, the Basketball World Cup will be held in the year following the FIFA World Cup. To that end, there will be no Basketball World Cup in 2018; the next tournament will take place in 2019. Also, the expansion to 32 teams, which had been proposed for 2014, will instead occur in 2019.\nNew Era (2019–current).\nThe 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup was awarded to China, the first time the country has hosted the tournament. The 2019 edition of the World Cup saw a record of 32 participating teams. In this tournament, then defending champions, the United States, failed to advance to the finals, losing to France in the quarter-finals. This was the first World Cup in history at which all three of the historically most successful teams (United States, Serbia/Yugoslavia and Russia/Soviet Union) failed to make it through to the semi-finals. It is also the worst result for the United States men's team at a World Cup; their previous worst result was sixth place in 2002.\nSpain captured their second title after beating Argentina in the final. France went on to win the bronze medal for the second consecutive time after defeating Australia.\nThe 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup was the first tournament to be co-hosted by multiple nations: the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia. It was the second straight World Cup to be held in the Asian continent and the first in tournament history where a host nation did not qualify. Then-defending champions Spain failed to make the quarter-finals for the first time since 1994, while Olympic champions United States failed to win a medal for the second consecutive tournament. Latvia, South Sudan, Georgia, and Cape Verde made their tournament debut, with Latvia finishing at 5th place.\nIn their first finals appearance, Germany captured its first title after beating Serbia. Led by tournament MVP Dennis Schröder, the country became only the 7th nation to win the World Cup. Canada went on to win the bronze medal, its first medal in World Cup history, after defeating the United States.\nThe 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup will be the first tournament to be held in the Arab world and the third straight to be held in Asia, with Qatar being awarded the hosting rights to host the event.\nFormat of each final tournament.\nThe FIBA Basketball World Cup has used several different formats between 1950 and 2010 as they have expanded and contracted between 10 and 24 teams throughout the years. Prior to 1978, the tournament most often used two group stages, with the final round being a round-robin. In every year since 1978, the tournament has used some variation of a group stage followed by a single-elimination tournament to determine the champion. The following table lists the format used for each tournament:\n(*) Results from 1st phase between qualified teams are carried on to the 2nd phase.\n(**) All results from 1st phase are carried on to the 2nd phase."

        "text": "Crystal Palace Park Cricket Ground was a cricket ground in Crystal Palace in south-east London. It was located in Crystal Palace Park in the shadow of The Crystal Palace. The ground was established on 3 June 1857 and used for first-class cricket between 1864 and 1906.\nThe site of the ground was part of the county of Kent when it was first established and it was initially used by Kent County Cricket Club in the 1860s before becoming the main ground for London County Cricket Club between 1900 and 1904. The site of the ground is now in the London Borough of Bromley and forms part of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre.\nCricket history.\nThe cricket ground at Crystal Palace was laid out in 1857 as part of the development of The Crystal Palace itself which had opened in 1854. A site was used and the ground became the home of Crystal Palace Cricket Club – prior to the development of the site the general location had been used as a ground by Sydenham Cricket Club. The club played at the ground until 1900 when they were wound up and its funds were distributed to local charities and Kent County Cricket Club.\nThe first recorded first-class cricket match on the ground was in 1864, when Kent County Cricket Club played Nottinghamshire. From 1869 to 1870, Kent played four further first-class matches at the ground, two in each season. The club has a tradition of playing cricket at grounds in what it terms \"Metropolitan Kent\". Grounds in nearby Beckenham, Blackheath, Catford and Dartford have all also been used by the club in the past for a total of more than 150 matches and the first match played by the county club after its foundation in 1842 was played at White Hart Field in Bromley.\nTen years passed before first-class cricket returned to Crystal Palace, when in 1880 the Players played the touring Australians at the ground. In 1888 an England XI played another touring Australian side and three further first-class matches took place on the ground from 1890 to 1900.\nIn 1898, the Crystal Palace Company formed London County Cricket Club after offering W.G. Grace the roles of the club's secretary, manager and captain. Grace accepted the offer and his 29-year association with Gloucestershire ended as a result of the conflicts between the new club and his county side. London County played their first first-class match at the ground in 1900 against Surrey. From 1900 to 1904 the team played 34 first-class matches at Crystal Palace, the last of which saw them play Warwickshire in August 1904. The increase in the importance of the County Championship, Grace's decline in form due to age and the lack of a competitive element in the matches led to a decline in attendances and meant that the team lost money, with the club winding up in 1908.\nThe Gentlemen of England used the ground for three first-class matches in 1905 against a touring Australian side, Oxford University and Cambridge University and in 1906 a WG Grace's XI played the touring West Indians and Cambridge University.\nModern use.\nDuring World War I the ground and surrounding ornamental gardens were used as a training depot by the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. This largely destroyed the cricket pitch and after the war the original cricket field was used as tennis courts from 1921 and then for football pitches. The pavilion was demolished in 1960 and the site today forms part of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, which was built in 1964. Facilities include an athletics stadium, indoor arena, swimming pool and a range of other sports facilities.\nA cricket ground was re-established on the site in the early 1990s. there are no cricket pitches in use in the park.\nRecords on the ground.\nA total of 48 first-class cricket matches were held on the ground between 1864 and 1906. London County were the home team in 34 of these with Kent playing as the home side in five. The two teams never played each other at Crystal Palace."

The Hall was owned by the Earls of Darnley and a number of the family were keen cricketers.

        "text": "The 1950-51 Australians defeated the touring England team 4-1 in the 1950-51 Ashes series, Australia's last Ashes success until 1958-59. The series was tilted the balance from the powerful Australian teams of the 1940s to the strong England teams of the 1950s. While in the end they won easily the team made heavy weather of defeating a weak touring team and would lose the next three hard-fought Ashes series. The newly knighted Sir Donald Bradman had retired from cricket, but most of his great 1948 Australian team still played and Australia had not lost a Test series since 1932-33.\nUnbeaten Run.\n\"At the fifteenth attempt since the war we won at Melbourne...It was then that I felt that the great Australian team was just beginning to deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.\"\nWhen they were defeated in the Fifth Test it ended their unbeaten run of 14 Tests against England, 26 Tests against all countries and 96 games in all cricket, having lost their last game to England at the Oval in 1938. Their record remained until England played 27 Tests without defeat in 1968-71. \nThe Captain.\n\"Hassett played to win, to the last inch and the last second. If he could not do that, he set out to prevent the other fellows from winning. Yet, if defeat was inevitable, he could take it as well as anybody\".\nLindsay Hassett had been Don Bradman's vice-captain in 1948, but his rise to the captaincy was not certain despite his seniority and talent. Australian cricket swung around the twin poles of Victoria and New South Wales who dominated the Sheffield Shield. Hassett was captain of Victoria and his rival Arthur Morris was captain of New South Wales, with some board members being biased against Hassett's Irish Catholic background, he only received the post by the barest of margins (7-6). Hassett was 37 by the 1950-51 season and Morris was tipped to lead the 1953 tour of England, but remained vice-captain to Hassett and his Victorian successor Ian Johnson and only led Australia in two Tests in their absence (which he both lost). Hassett himself was a dimulative (5'6\") batsman who had been a great strokemaker before the war and had made his Test debut in England in 1938. He performed well for the Australian Services cricket team and in the Victory Tests against England in 1945. After the war he took his batting more seriously and was more defensive, though never dull, and he never failed in a series. He had an impish good humour, but as captain tended to become serious on the field. Although a keen tactician he lacked the aggressiveness and self-confidence of Bradman, but then he also lacked Bradman's batting and Hassett would see Australia overshadowed by the strong England teams of the mid-1950s.\nBatting.\n\"One of Lindsay Hassett's biggest problems in the series just completed against Brown's team was to attempt the impossible and hide his fear of losing a wicket. In each and every Test match Alec Bedser exposed the Australian weakness, and young Neil Harvey was sacrificed in an attempt to keep the bad news from the crowds.\"\nThe only weakness that could be seen in the Australian team was their batting, Don Bradman (99.94), Sid Barnes (63.05) and Bill Brown (46.82) had all retired and had not been fully replaced. The vice-captain Arthur Morris (46.48) was labeled \"Bedser's Bunny\" as the English bowler dismissed him easily in the first three Tests, but he made 168 and 105 against the tourists for New South Wales and 100 for an Australian XI. He finally laid the bunny to rest with his highest Test century in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 206 out of 371. The real trouble was finding him a suitable opening partner as Jack Moroney made a pair, Ken Archer never made a Test 50 and Jim Burke failed when promoted after making an unbeaten century on his Test debut. It was a problem that was not solved and Lindsay Hassett took to opening the batting in 1953 and Morris had another succession of partners in 1954-55. Neil Harvey (48.42) was still a baby-faced youngster in 1950-51, committed to strokeplay regardless of the situation. He had a steady series and initially came in at number 3 before being moved down to his natural position at number 4. Lindsay Hassett replaced him and the Australian captain made more runs than anybody else in the team, but failed to make a century. However, he did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, Miller topped the Australian batting averages and was the only man who could - briefly - take the attack to the accurate bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. Sam Loxton (36.93) was a big-hitting all-rounder, but his bowling days were behind him and was used as a middle order batsmen, without success. Ian Johnson was a useful tailender who could have been a fully-fledged all rounder with greater application and made 77 in the Third Test at Sydney. Don Tallon was a useful lower-order batsmen in 1948, but failed in all the Tests and his increasing deafness made him a poor runner. Bill Johnston was an awkward batsmen who could be difficult to remove, but the last man was Jack Iverson \"...whose batting pretensions are possibly no higher than those of a third-grade schoolboy player\".\nBowling.\n\"Iverson's final figures were the magnificent ones of 19.4-8-27-6, and never have I seen a bowler so completely on top of batsmen, length, spin and flight all being allied in perfect formation to produce a performance bearing the stamp of genius. Those who belittled this Victoria man, who learned to bowl his spinners in an unorthodox manner during the war years, were now forced to admit that Australia had found another bowling trump card.\"\nThe home side were still able to call on the bowlers of Don Bradman's Great 1948 Team; the hostile pace of Ray Lindwall (23.03) and Keith Miller (22.97), the left-arm swing and left arm spin of Bill Johnston (23.91), the flighted off-spinners of Ian Johnson and the mystery spin of Jack Iverson. Ray Lindwall was regarded as the finest fast bowler after the war, with a perfectly controlled action; \"he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps - until the last couple of strides of his approach, when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride...when he releases the ball, his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round-arm\". He had had a mixed tour of South Africa in 1949-50, failing to take a wicket in the first three South African innings and being dropped for the last Test, his form suffering from groin strain, fibrositis and a stomach disorder. This led to speculation that at 29 the fast bowler's career might soon be over as \"his pace was not what it was by any means, and his arm is much lower...his action is more laboured and his body does not follow through\". Lindwall returned to the team and would bowl for Australia throughout the 1950s, though Lindsay Hassett tended to underuse him in the series, the opposite of Bradman who overbowled him. Keith Miller was the \"glamour boy\" of the Australian team \"his batting was a joy to behold, his fast bowling can be both fascinating to watch and deadly in effect, while his fielding in the slips and in the covers is feline in its anticipation and soundness\". There was a national outcry when he was not picked for the South Africa tour, both as the mercurial all rounder didn't want to bowl (his back had in injured when a night-fighter pilot in the Second World War), not helped by his well-known antipathy with the new Test selector Don Bradman, but was later flown out as a replacement. \"Big Bill\" Johnston was a powerful left-arm swing bowler who would be Australia's best wicket-taker in the series despite the fame of Lindwall and Miller. Like Miller he could bowl spin, but instead of mixing his bowling he saved his slow left arm spinners for when the opposition were caught on a sticky wicket. Ian Johnson was an off-spinner, a rarity in Australian cricket which tended to prefer leg-spinners. He was not a big turner of the ball, and one of the slowest bowlers in cricket, but he used flight to deceive the batsmen and tied down one end while the fast bowlers rested. To these veterans could be added the extraordinary mystery spin of Jack Iverson, who had found that he could use his long middle finger to turn the ball either way when whiling away the hours in the New Guinea campaign. Although never more than an occasional Grade cricketer before the war Iverson perfected his art and was chosen to play for his native Victoria in 1949-50, but was on the verge of quitting cricket when the England team arrived. He was 35 and his ailing father needed him to take over the family business, but stayed at the helm against his doctor's advice so that Iverson could play for Australia. He took 3/85 for Victoria vs the tourists and though he only dismissed three tailenders he caused the batsmen enough trouble to be picked for the Test team and the First Test at Brisbane was the first Test match he ever saw. His greatest day came in the Third Test at Sydney when he took 6/27 in Australia's innings victory. He retired at the end of the season even though he had \"the world's best batsmen at his mercy, if he could spare the time\".\nFielding.\n\"His fielding was almost a minus quality. Hassett would be saddled with the difficult task of hiding him away from busy corners all day long. But the fielding of the team as a whole was thought to be brittle. Moroney...would never be accused of being a mobile unit of the out-cricket, and Ian Johnson was, in my opinion, anyhow, a very doubtful quantity especially as a slip-fieldsman, where he seemed likely to do duty...I sympathized with Hassett over the big job he faced in getting good fielding done with the quality of the manpower as his disposal. There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.\"\nQueensland's Don Tallon was reaching the end of his career, but despite his poor performances managed to hold his place against his rivals Gil Langley and Ron Saggers even though he had missed the tour South Africa in 1949-50. He took only 8 catches in the 5 Test series, missed every stumping chance and only satisfied his critics in the Third Test at Sydney. Otherwise the Australians were usually far superior to the England side in the field - the 1953 Australians were considered to be the best fielding team ever to tour England - and they trained hard to improve their performance. Neil Harvey was an outstanding in the covers, Ian Johnson was considered to be one of the best slip fielders in the world and Keith Miller and Sam Loxton were good catchers of the ball in any position.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nReferences.\nAshes Australian Cricket team 2017/18"

Foley (April 19, 1939 – November 29, 2020) was an American professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected in the second round as the 18th pick in the 1962 NBA draft by the Celtics and spent one season playing in the league. Foley was given the nickname \"the Shot\" because of his explosive offensive ability.\nA native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Foley attended Assumption High School, where he graduated in 1958. He decided to stay close to home when playing college basketball and enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross. Since college freshmen were ineligible to participate on varsity teams, Foley's college career did not officially begin until 1959–60. In his three seasons as a Crusader, he scored so many points that his nickname, \"the Shot\", was what he was commonly referred to. In his sophomore season, Foley averaged 24.6 points per game (ppg), followed by 26.9 ppg and 33.3 ppg during his junior and senior seasons, respectively. In his senior year of 1961–62, he finished second in the nation in scoring behind Utah's Bill McGill (38.8 ppg). That season, Foley garnered consensus Second Team All-American honors. In addition to his high season scoring averages, Foley also put up big single game numbers. He is the record holder of the two highest scoring games in school history—56 points against Connecticut in 1962 and 55 against Colgate in 1960—as well as having scored 40 or more points five times in his career. Foley became the first player in school history to score 2,000 career points, and his 2,185 points was the most in school history until the early 1980s.\nFoley's professional career was not spectacular, especially compared to his college career. He played in five total games for the Celtics in , averaging 6.4 points, before being sold to the New York Knicks on January 22, 1963. He then played in six games for the Knicks and averaged 3.5 points. For his career, Foley scored 53 points, grabbed 16 rebounds and recorded 5 assists.\nFollowing his basketball career, Foley became a high school teacher and girls' basketball coach. He died from Parkinson's disease on November 29, 2020, at his home in Worcester.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "The 1952 Winter Olympics were held in and around Oslo, Norway, from 14 to 25 February 1952. Ten competition and eight non-competition venues were used, in addition to three designated, but unused, reserve competition venues. Six of the competition venues were located in Oslo, while one each was located in Bærum, Skedsmo, Drammen and Krødsherad. Bislett stadion was the centerpiece of the games, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, the speed skating and the figure skating. Bislett featured both a circumference speed skating track and a long rink used for figure skating, separated by snow banks. Two reserve venues were designated for the skating events, Tryvann stadion in Oslo and Hamar stadion in Hamar.\nJordal Amfi, an outdoor artificial ice rink, was built with a capacity for 10,000 spectators. This allowed ice hockey to be played on artificial ice for the first time at the Olympics. Of the tournament's 36 matches, 23 were played at Jordal, while the remaining were played at Kadettangen in Bærum, Dælenenga idrettspark in Oslo, Lillestrøm stadion in Skedsmo and Marienlyst stadion in Drammen.\nThe ski jumping, cross-country skiing and Nordic combined events were held at Holmenkollbakken, from the city center. Although upgraded several times since its opening in 1892, the former wooden superstructure was replaced with a concrete tower and in-run ahead of the Olympics, with the out-run being extended to . Stands were erected to seat 13,000 people, with capacity for an additional 130,000 standing spectators at the base of the hill. Cross-country races started and ended at the base of the ski hill. A switchboard was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors during the races. Most of the stands built for the ski jumping competition had to be removed for the cross-country races. As a result, there was little room for spectators to sit and watch the cross-country events. Spectators were therefore allowed to walk within the course.\nThe alpine skiing events were split between Rødkleiva, located in Oslo near Holmenkollen, and Norefjell, located at Krødsherad, from Oslo and the only venue outside Greater Oslo. Rødkleiva featured the slalom events, with an elevation difference on the hill of and a course length of . Downhill and giant slalom, the latter of which was making its Olympic debut, were competed at Norefjell. Considerable construction and upgrades were made to the area to make it suitable for Olympic competition. A bridge was built across the lake of Krøderen to help with transportation concerns; a new hotel, two ski lifts, and a new road were also constructed.\nThere was no permanent bobsleigh run in Norway as there was very little interest in the sport. The organizers decided to build a temporary course, Korketrekkeren, out of snow, which ran down the hill from Frognerseteren, near Holmenkollen. The course was long and featured 13 turns. The run was built and tested in 1951, and was rebuilt in 1952 in time for the Olympics.\nCompetition venues.\nThe following list contains the ten venues used for competitions during the 1952 Winter Olympics. They are listed by their name, as well as containing the sports held at the venue, the municipality where they are located and the spectator capacity.\nReserve venues.\nThree reserve venues were designated, should the weather not make it possible to hold events in Oslo. The following list contains the venue, the municipality they are located in, and the events for which they were designated.\nNon-competition venues.\nThe following is a list of the eight non-competition venues for the Olympics. This includes the name of the venue, the municipality in which it is located and its purpose.\nPost-Olympic use.\nBislett remained a speed skating venue until 1988, after which it only hosted athletics and football. Between 1925 and 1986, it saw 13 world championships and 10 European championships in speed skating. The structure was demolished and replaced with a new stadium in 2005. It hosts the annual Bislett Games, now part of the Diamond League in athletics. Marienlyst is used as a football stadium, and hosts both Strømsgodset IF and the Norway national under-21 football team. Lillestrøm, Dælenenga and Kadettangen are only used for lower-level football, as they lack any significant spectator stands. Jordal Amfi received a roof in 1972 and hosted the World Ice Hockey Championships in 1958 and 1999. Holmenkollbakken has been rebuilt several times since the Olympics; most recently it was entirely rebuilt in 2010. The complex has received a ski stadium, collectively known as Holmenkollen National Arena. In addition to the annual Holmenkollen Ski Festival, the hill hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011."

        "text": "The 2004 Snooker Grand Prix (known as the 2004 Totesport Grand Prix for sponsorship reasons) was the 2004 edition of the Grand Prix snooker tournament and was held from 2 to 10 October 2004 at the Guild Hall in Preston, England. World number one Ronnie O'Sullivan won the tournament defeating Ian McCulloch by nine frames to five (9–5) in the final. In the semi-finals O'Sullivan defeated Paul Hunter 6–3 and McCulloch beat Michael Judge 6–1. Mark Williams, who won the same event under the name LG Cup the year before, lost in the first round. John Higgins made the highest break with a 147. The 64-man tournament was the first of eight World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) ranking events in the 2004/2005 snooker season and the next event following last season's World Championship, which was won by O'Sullivan. It preceded the second ranking event of the season, the British Open.\nTournament summary.\nThe tournament was created as the Professional Players Tournament in 1982 by the snooker governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), to provide another ranking event. It was renamed the Grand Prix for the 1984 event until 2001, when it was called the LG Cup, before reverting to the Grand Prix this year. The tournament was the first of eight WPBSA ranking events in the 2004/2005 snooker season, and the next event following last season's World Championship, which was won by Ronnie O'Sullivan, now a two-time world champion and the world number one. Mark Williams won the same event under the name LG Cup last year. The tournament preceded the second ranking event of the season, the British Open. Sponsored by totesport for the first time after signing a one-year contract announced the day before the event started, it had a prize fund of £400,000 and was broadcast on the BBC and Eurosport.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying rounds were played between players on the main tour ranked 33 and lower for one of 32 places in the final stage at Pontin's Snooker Centre in Prestatyn, Wales. The matches were best-of-9 frames until the semi-finals. Highly regarded 17-year-old Chinese player Ding Junhui narrowly missed out in qualifying. The other successful qualifiers included the likes of Mark Selby, Barry Hawkins, Shaun Murphy and Neil Robertson.\nRound one.\nIn round one the 32 qualifiers faced members of the top 32, including the top 16 seeds. In this round O'Sullivan defeated Mark Davis 5–2, compiling a century break of 114. After the match O'Sullivan praised his mentor Ray Reardon. World number 51 Andy Hicks won against the UK champion Matthew Stevens 5–1, compiling two century breaks and three half-centuries in the 72-minute match. After struggling early on, 1997 world champion Ken Doherty went through by beating Anthony Davies 5–1. Dominic Dale, the 1997 winner, made breaks of 108, 68, 61 and 58 in defeating Scott MacKenzie 5–1. David Gray whitewashed Lee Walker 5–0, while Joe Perry beat Pakistan's Shokat Ali 5–1. James Wattana lost a frame after three consecutive misses from an position, but still defeated John Parrott 5–2, a match in which Parrott's highest break was 32.\nSix-time world champion Steve Davis, the oldest player on the tour at 47, defeated Sean Storey 5–1, after which he said \"At the start I couldn't hit the side of a bus station, but Sean let me off and in the end I didn't play badly.\" Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry prevailed 5–4 over Jamie Burnett in a narrowly fought contest. Burnett, the world number 49, was 4–3 ahead and had potted the final red, but he missed the black, however, and Hendry forced a deciding frame which he won. After the match, Hendry said \"I got out of jail\". Breaks of 75, 61 and 56 enabled 2002 world champion Peter Ebdon to claim a 5–2 victory over Simon Bedford. Chinese player Jin Long, in his first appearance in the final stage of a ranking event, led Tony Drago 3–0 before Drago won five consecutive frames. Nigel Bond defeated Gerard Greene 5–2, while Anthony Hamilton overcame Jimmy Michie by the same scoreline. Marco Fu, a former Grand Prix runner-up, claimed a 5–2 victory over David Roe. After coming back from 3–4 down to beat Patrick Wallace 5–4, Jimmy White revealed he nearly withdrew from the tournament because of a back injury he sustained in a charity pool match the week before the tournament.\nWilliams, the world number two, was the highest ranked player to lose in the round when he lost 2–5 against Michael Judge. In the fifth frame, at 2–2, Williams was 64–0 ahead but a black ball clearance of 70 gave Judge the lead, who went on to win the match. After the match, Williams said that he was nowhere near the player he was a year ago. World number four and Masters champion Paul Hunter made breaks of 108 and 127 in defeating Darren Morgan 5–3. European Open winner Stephen Maguire defeated Murphy 5–2, a match in which Maguire had a frame docked. As the match was about to begin and after they had shaken hands, Maguire realised he had not brought his with him. He asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to retrieve it, which was granted. As Maguire was away, Murphy spoke to the referee and questioned whether Maguire should be docked a frame, as he was technically not ready to play at the scheduled time. Mike Ganley, the tournament director, was called and docked a frame from Maguire, a ruling which angered Maguire. Of the incident Maguire said \"Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before.\" The incident was said to be a key point in the rivalry between Maguire and Murphy.\nJohn Higgins made the highest break in the tournament with a maximum break in his 3–5 loss to Ricky Walden. It was his fifth maximum and the 49th in snooker history. It also earned him a bonus of £20,000. For Walden it was the second time he reached the second round of a ranking event. In a match in which the deciding frame lasted 64 minutes and ended past midnight, Alan McManus overcame Fergal O'Brien 5–4. Graeme Dott, the surprise runner-up at the World Championship, emerged a 5–4 winner over Ryan Day. Of the other seeded players, Chris Small lost 4–5 to Selby, Stephen Lee beat Hugh Abernethy 5–2 and Quinten Hann lost 3–5 against Marcus Campbell.\nRound two.\nDavis became the first player through to the last 16 when he defeated Drago 5–1, after which he expressed his surprise he was still in the tournament. O'Sullivan overcame a chest infection to beat Joe Swail 5–1, but missed his post-match press conference. Hunter came from 2–4 down with a score of 0–39 in the seventh to beat Ali Carter, compiling a century break in the decider. Preston's Ian McCulloch beat White 5–4 with a break of 73 in the deciding frame. After beating Robert Milkins 5–3, Hendry expressed dissatisfaction with his performance. Maguire, the Snooker Writers' Association Young Player of the Year, saw off Walden 5–3 and said of the chalk incident \"I made sure I had it this time.\" In the match between Fu and Hawkins Fu led 4–2, before Hawkins forced a deciding frame, which Fu won. Judge continued his run by defeating Campbell 5–4 with breaks of 76, 61, and 52, and said his victory over Williams had given him confidence. Although he fluked the final brown from a snooker, Wattana potted the blue and pink balls in the final frame of his match against Doherty to win 5–3. Doherty said \"It was a cruel blow. ... I had James in a really good snooker and from where I was sat it did not even look as though he could hit it.\" Of the other seeds, Lee enjoyed a 5–1 victory over Hamilton, Dott defeated Dale 5–2, Ebdon beat Joe Jogia 5–4, Perry beat David Gray 5–3 and McManus lost 4–5 against Nigel Bond. The other non-seeded victors were Selby and Australian Robertson.\nRound three.\nIn the third round Dott failed to comeback from his loss in the final of the World Championship, as he was defeated 3–5 by O'Sullivan. After beating Davis 5–1, Hunter said he wished Davis would speed up his play. In the match Hunter made his fourth century break of the tournament and had breaks of 71, 66, 43, and 53. Hendry was defeated 3–5 by McCulloch by losing five of the last six frames, and said he was not the player he was. His break of 67 in the last frame was eclipsed by McCulloch's 72, who also made a break of 105 in the match. Breaks of 133 and 103 plus further runs of 41, 70, and 87 enabled Perry to beat Robertson 5–3 from 1–3 down. Selby saw off Ebdon 5–3 and said \"Hopefully there's more to come.\" Maguire defeated Bond 5–1, while Wattana beat Lee and Judge beat Fu by the same scoreline.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals O'Sullivan took 71 minutes to whitewash Selby 5–0, compiling two breaks of 135 and outscoring Selby 522–46. After the match O'Sullivan said \"My safety was good, so was my thinking, and so was my break-building. It's as well as I have played in the tournament.\" Another whitewash occurred when Wattana was defeated 0–5 by Hunter, a match eight minutes longer than O'Sullivan's, whom he would face in the semi-finals. After the match Hunter said \"I was racing Ronnie. I could see from the scoreboard that he was 3–0 up when I was leading 2–0.\"\nIn the other quarter-finals McCulloch defeated Maguire 5–2 after an error from Maguire, when he missed the pink for a probable 2–0 lead. The match included a 137 clearance from McCulloch. After the match Maguire said \"I went for a crazy one and paid the price but I think today I was just a bit too cocky. I didn't believe I was going to lose.\" Judge beat Perry 5–1 to face McCulloch in his first ranking event semi-final, and became the fourth Irish player to achieve this feat after Eugene Hughes, Doherty and Fergal O'Brien.\nSemi-finals.\nIn the semi-final, now best-of-11 frames, O'Sullivan defeated Hunter 6–3. O'Sullivan started strongly and opened up a lead of 3–1 at the mid-session interval. Hunter closed the gap to 2–3, before O'Sullivan won the sixth frame. A break of 80 from Hunter followed, before O'Sullivan won the next two for the match, compiling a 107 in the final frame.\nThe other semi-final saw McCulloch beat Judge 6–1, a match in which Judge's highest break was 44 early in the game. McCulloch achieved runs of 132 and 89 after Judge hit a kick shot on a red ball that went away from its projected path on his way to victory. After his defeat Judge said he was happy with his form during the tournament.\nFinal.\nIn the best-of-17 frame final O'Sullivan defeated McCulloch 9–5 to win his second consecutive ranking title. It was his 21st ranking final and 16th ranking title, which meant he was now third on the list ahead of Williams and Higgins. The victory earned him £60,000 and meant he had won all the ranking events on the calendar at least once. After the match O'Sullivan said he could still improve: \"I have set myself high standards and I don't think I was firing on any cylinders.\" McCulloch said he was sure he would win a ranking title: \"I have lost two finals now but I will win one—it is just a matter of when.\"\nIn the first session of the final O'Sullivan won the first frame with a break of 86. The next two frames were shared, before O'Sullivan made a century, which he followed with a 72 in the frame after. The sixth frame lasted 36 minutes, when O’Sullivan struck in the pink to a distant pocket before clipping in a tricky black for a 5–1 lead. McCulloch won the next to bring the score to 5–2 in O'Sullivan's favour at the end of the first session. In the second session O'Sullivan took the first two frames with breaks of 66 and 104. O'Sullivan won two of the next three frames to bring the score to 8–4, before missing a relatively straightforward pot in the 13th, which allowed McCulloch to take the frame. A break of 71 in the next gave O'Sullivan the victory.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nMain draw.\nNumbers to the left of the players' names are the tournament seedings.

        "text": "The 2010–11 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team represented Princeton University in intercollegiate college basketball during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The head coach was Sydney Johnson, who was in his fourth season. The team's tri-captains were senior Kareem Maddox, senior Dan Mavraides, and junior Patrick Saunders. The team played its home games in the Jadwin Gymnasium on the University campus in Princeton, New Jersey. The team competes in the Ivy League athletic conference. The team was coming off of a 22–9 2009–10 season in which it achieved the most wins by a Tigers men's basketball team since the 1998–99 team and its first back-to-back finishes of at least second place in the Ivy since 2001–02 season. The team was also following on the heels of its first postseason appearance since the 2003–04 team went to the 2004 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, and its first postseason victory since the 1998–99 team won two games in the 1999 National Invitation Tournament.\nThe team was led by returning second team All-Ivy League selections junior Douglas Davis and senior Dan Mavraides. This was the first team to have two returning first or second All-Ivy players since the 2003–04 team returned Will Venable and Judson Wallace. The team was attempting to defend its scoring defense statistical championship, which it won for the twentieth time since 1976 in 2010. Following the season, seniors Mavraides (2nd team) and Maddox (1st team, unanimous) earned All-Ivy recognition. They were joined by sophomore Ian Hummer (2nd team). Maddox earned conference Defensive Player of the Year.\nAfter the annual 14-game round robin home and away schedule, Harvard and Princeton tied as co-champion, resulting in a one-game playoff to determine the league's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Tigers prevailed. Princeton then lost its round of 64 NCAA contest against Kentucky. The season marked the team's 26th Ivy League championship and 24th invitation to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship.\nPreview.\nPrinceton entered the season having not won a championship since the 2003–04 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team achieved the feat and went to the 2004 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The six-season championshipless spell tied a school record and put the team on the verge of establishing a new one should the season not be successful. The team entered the season with its top five scorers from the prior season returning. The team's schedule included the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament champion Duke as well as Tournament participant who were the 2010 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference champions (both regular season and tournament).\nMost preseason publications predicted Princeton would finish in first place and Harvard would finish in second place, although the \"Sporting News\" projected that would finish in first followed by Princeton and Harvard. Breaking a three-year streak by Cornell, the Ivy League media poll selected Princeton as the top team with twelve first place votes, Harvard second with four first place votes and Cornell third with one first place vote. It was the first Princeton team to be the preseason top-ranked media selection since the .\nPlaying style.\nHead coach Johnson employs the Princeton offense. However, in 2010, Johnson tweaked it to be a slightly more uptempo version of the motion offense, which resulted in the highest scoring Princeton team in decades. The offense was still considered slow compared to most schools.\nSchedule.\nThe team lost to its only two ranked opponents (#1 Duke and #21 University of Central Florida), but defeated Siena in overtime. The team also defeated power conference opponents of Conference USA, of the Atlantic 10 Conference and of the Big East Conference. Princeton recorded its 11th and the Ivy League's 30th perfect conference record at the halfway point of the 14-game conference schedule. The team posted a perfect 12–0 home record. It was the team's sixth perfect home season in 42 full seasons at Jadwin gymnasium. In 2009, the team adopted 11-year-old Christian Michael \"Crunch\" Regulski, a pediatric brain tumor patient, as part of the Friends of Jaclyn program. In early February, Crunch, who had previously sat on the team's bench, lost his cancer struggle. During the season, Princeton swept defending Ivy League champion Cornell.\nMavraides scored 25 including 5 three-point shots, but Princeton lost to Harvard at Lavietes Pavilion on March 5 and giving them a split of the season series. Princeton fell a half game behind Harvard who clinched at least a share of the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season Championship with a 12–2 conference record. Princeton fell to 11–2 with one conference game remaining to force a one-game playoff for the conferences automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Following the game, Sydney Johnson made his team sit on the bench and watch the Harvard fans celebrate. On March 8, Princeton defeated Penn to force a one-game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Maddox scored 21 of his 23 points from off the bench in the second half to key the victory.\nThe one-game playoff is the eighth in Ivy League history and the eighth for Princeton, who has won at least a share of twenty-six league titles. The share of the championship ended a six-season championshipless run, which tied a record for the longest in school history. In the one-game playoff, Harvard took 58–57 lead with 2:33 remaining and then the teams traded one-point leads 5 times. Princeton won by a 63–62 margin thanks to a last second shot by Davis to earn its 24th NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament bid. Although Princeton did not appear in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings all season, in the final regular season poll on March 13, Princeton received 3 points in the Coaches' Poll.\nPrinceton was awarded the number thirteen seed and a first round match against the Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky had eliminated Ivy League representative Cornell the prior season.

The team finished tied for first in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association regular season, won the CCHA tournament and the 1996 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament.\nSeason.\nComing off of its 5th consecutive 30+ win season, 3rd Frozen Four appearance in 4 years and returning both the NCAA's scoring leader (Brendan Morrison) and wins leader (Marty Turco) the 1995–96 Michigan Wolverines were expected to again compete for the national title. Michigan was second in the preseason rankings by American Hockey Magazine, the first time that any poll was nationally recognized.\nFast start.\nEven though they dominated an outclassed Guelph squad in one of the last seasons that the NCAA permitted official games against CIS schools, Michigan opened its conference schedule against Western Michigan and fell flat on its face. The Wolverines lost the first game 2–7 at home before salvaging the weekend with a 3–2 road win. While the Wolverines dropped to fifth in the polls, they were down three forwards for the big game against Maine. The first annual US Hockey Hall of Fame Game was a rematch of last year's national semifinal, the then-longest game in NCAA tournament history, but with Morrison still recovering from a knee sprain and both Matt Herr and John Madden suspended for the game, fortunately for the Wolverines, Madden's suspension was reversed and he was allowed to play in the game. Despite facing 37 shots and 9 power plays from the Black Bears Turco dominated throughout the game, surrendering only three goals while his counterpart Blair Allison allowed 6 goals on just 23 attempts.\nAfter the high-profile win, Michigan won each game over the next three weekends and temporarily regained its #2 ranking. During that span Morrison returned from his injury and his 3-point night showed he was more than ready. Michigan also shut but out the opposition for the second time that season but with Turco sharing the net with Gregg Malicke on both occasions no goaltender received credit for either '0'.\nMid-season hiccup.\nThe Wolverines headed into the third annual College Hockey Showcase ranked third and after an easy win against Wisconsin the Wolverines looked a bit flat against #5 Minnesota, dropping the game 2–3.\nThree days later Michigan faced off against arch-rival Michigan State and though the Spartans were unranked at the time they were still a force to contend with. MSU handed the Wolverines their second consecutive loss and, with #8 Bowling Green up next, Michigan was in jeopardy of dropping from the polls. An offensive outburst of 5 goals in the first period helped arrest Michigan's slide and the 8–1 win gave the voters enough confidence in the Maize and Blue to keep them at the #4 spot. One side story with the game was Jason Botterill, a first round pick of the Dallas Stars, had already been suspended twice for fighting and was piling up unneeded penalty minutes. In the Bowling Green Game he was finally able to keep his nose clean while retaining his physical game, performing exactly how coach Red Berenson hoped he would.\nMichigan Would end the first half of its season with an oddly scheduled weekend where they won at home against Lake Superior State then lost in their worst offensive performance of the season at #10 Western Michigan. The loss to the Broncos was even worse considering that Michigan had finally claimed the top spot in the CCHA from WMU the day before but now with the season series permanently in favor of their conference rivals Michigan was dropped back to third place.\nGreat Lakes Invitational.\nAt the 31st Great Lakes Invitational, Michigan was looking to continue its run of championships. After trouncing Northern Michigan in the semifinal, the crowd of 18,000 at the Joe Louis Arena watched the Wolverines defeat #10 Michigan State for their 8th consecutive GLI title. Brendan Morrison was named as the tournament MVP for the third consecutive year after contributing on 6 of Michigan's 9 goals.\nMichigan did not rest on its tournament win, completely dominating both opponents the following weekend by a combined score of 23–3. Morrison was again the star, earning 11 points in the two games and climbing up into the scoring race. Both weekends were missed by Botterill who was busy playing at the 1996 World Junior Championships, becoming the first player to win three gold medals at the event. The Wolverines continued to dominate the opposition for another two weeks winning each game and closing to within 2 points of the top spot in the CCHA with a game in hand. Botterill continued to build on his game, recording a hat-trick for the third time in 5 games.\nThe good times could not keep rolling, however, and the following weekend Michigan could only escape with a tie against a down Ohio State squad before losing the following night at Bowling Green. The next weekend Michigan hosted the Buckeyes and earned 3 points but had now dropped 6 points behind Michigan State for the CCHA crown.\nCatching up.\nThe schedule handed Michigan a win when the Spartans and Broncos split a weekend series, allowing the Wolverine's 2 wins to put them in second place with a showdown against MSU looming. After both teams won on Friday, Michigan and Michigan State met at the Joe Louis Arena for the second time the game remained close for 40 minutes but the Wolverine's potent offense broke the game open in the third, finding the net 5 times with the power play finishing 4 for 6 and leading Michigan to an 8–1 win and putting them 2 points back with a game in hand.\nRiding high from their win, Michigan endured a nightmare weekend at #7 Lake Superior State, losing both games and bringing the Lakers into a tie for second with Blue. Fortunately Michigan's next game was against the Spartans and the conclusion of their regular season series. The Wolverines won their third game against MSU and followed that up with a win over Bowling Green. With the Spartans idle, the two points sent Michigan above Michigan State in the standings and allowed Michigan to claim a shared CCHA title with the Lakers.\nCCHA tournament.\nThe series loss to the Lakers left Michigan with the #2 seed and a first round meeting with Miami. Turco was stellar in the series, surrendering only one goal in the two-game sweep. In the semifinal they were met by the Spartans once more and the third time at 'The Joe'. The Wolverines continued their winning streak with a 6–2 win then met Lake Superior in the championship and avenged their earlier losses with a 4–3 victory.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe CCHA tournament title almost earned Michigan the #1 seed but Colorado College's superior record had them as the top western seed. The second spot for Michigan did grant them a bye into the regional semifinal where they faced WCHA champion and fifth-ranked Minnesota. The Gopher defense was stifling throughout the first half of the game, limiting Michigan to just 2 shots in the first. With the Wolverines down 1–2 in the second and in desperate need of a goal, Mike Legg for himself alone behind the Minnesota net and when no Gopher went to challenge him he had time to scoop the puck up with his stick and stash it into the top corner while he was still behind the net. 'The Michigan Goal' immediately became famous as the first time anyone scored a lacrosse-style goal during a game, or at last a game with cameras rolling. The stunned Golden Gophers continued to play well but with the tension that the Wolverines had been playing with now apparently gone, Michigan was able to score twice in the third and advance to the Frozen Four.\nIn Cincinnati, Michigan faced #3 Boston University who had spent much of the year as the #1 team, but the defending national champions had faltered at the end of their season and continued that trend against Michigan. Defense was the key to the game, allowing BU to only get 17 shots on goal with each being turned aside by Marty Turco for his 5th solo shutout of the season. Part of the bad game can be attributed to a damaged cooling pipe that caused the game to be delayed by 90 minutes, but the Wolveries had to endure the same wait.\nThe championship game saw Michigan returning for the first time since 1977 where they faced a familiar foe. The Wolvers had played Colorado College for the NCAA championship three times before, though not since 1957 (which was CC's last championship appearance), and now the top two teams in the nation were the only ones left vying for the title. Michigan opened the scoring in the first but after the Tigers' rebounded in the second Michigan found itself down 1–2. Mike Legg tied the game on the power play but neither team could regain the lead before the end of regulation. When overtime began the Michigan faithful grew worried; the Wolverines had lost in overtime in each of the previous three NCAA tournaments and desperately hoping that they were not about to see a repeat performance. Both team played conservatively for the first few minutes but when a clearing attempt from Colin Schmidt hit Morrison the puck bounced to the Wolverine alternate captain who slid the puck to Greg Crozier in the high slot. Crozier's shot was blocked but the puck bounced to Bill Muckalt who was standing off to the side of the net. Bob Needham slid to block the shot but it got on goal where Ryan Bach made the save but ended up off-balance, falling away from the front of the cage. The rebound slid to a stop at the top of the goal crease when Morrison came streaking in from the right circle and knocked the puck into a half-vacated net for Michigan's 8th national championship and 1st in 32 years.\nAwards and honors.\nBrendan Morrison was awarded the Tournament MOP and was joined by Marty Turco and Steven Halko on the All-Tournament team. Morrison finished tied for fifth in the nation in scoring and was Michigan's lone appearance on the AHCA All-American West First Team while Kevin Hilton both players were also on the All-CCHA First Team while Halko and Jason Botterill made the Second team. Marty Turco tied the record for most wins in an NCAA season with 34 and finished second in the nation with a 2.16 goals against average but received no recognition from the voters for his accomplishments. Morrison and John Madden were the only Wolverines to receive an individual conference award, with Morrison earning Player of the Year while Madden took home the Tournament MVP.\nMorrison earned \"The Hockey News\" U.S. College Player of the Year award for the first of two consecutive years. He was joined on the CCHA All-Conference first team by Kevin Hilton.\nJohn Madden established the current NCAA Division I national record for single-season shorthanded goals (10). The team led the nation in both goals allowed per game and scoring margin per game. Hilton led the CCHA in assists (44) and points (50), while Jason Botterill led the conference in goals (26). Madden led in conference shorthanded goals (5). The team had the conference's best power play. The team had the top two, four of the top five and five of the top ten conferences scorers.\nThe win by Michigan also began a resurgence in popularity of the program that had been lagging far behind the football and basketball teams for years.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The head coach was Red Berenson and the team captain was Brendan Morrison. The team played its home games in the Yost Ice Arena on the University campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The team finished first in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association regular season, won the CCHA Tournament and qualified for the Frozen Four of the 1997 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nThe team was led by John Madden, Brendan Morrison, and Marty Turco who were Division I All-Americans selections of the American Hockey Coaches Association. For Morrison it was his third consecutive selection. Morrison earned the same Central Collegiate Hockey Association Player of the Year and \"The Hockey News\" U.S. College Player of the Year awards he had won the year before. He also earned the Hobey Baker Award. He was joined on the CCHA All-Conference first team by Turco and Madden, who was selected as the conferences best defensive forward. Madden has gone on to become the only Wolverine to win the Stanley Cup three different times as a player with the 2000 and 2003 New Jersey Devils as well as the 2010 Chicago Blackhawks.\nMorrison ended his career as the school recordholder for both single-season (57, 1996–97) and career (182, 1994–97) assists as well as career points (284, 1994–97). The records remain unbroken. Madden established the current NCAA Division I national record for career shorthanded goals (23). Morrison led the nation in points per game (2.02) and assists per game (1.31); Jason Botterill led the nation in power play goals (19); Madden led the nation in short-handed goals (8); and Marty Turco led the nation in goalie winning percentage (.850). The team led the nation in both goals allowed per game and scoring margin per game for the second year in a row. Morrison led the CCHA in goals and points, while Turco led in goals against average. The team led the conference in both power play and penalty killing. The team had the top two and three of the top four conference scorers. Madden tied with Randy Robitaille in conference shorthanded goals.\nThe team concluded the Central Collegiate Hockey Association regular season as the conference championship with a 21–3–3 record. Their 3 losses were at Michigan State, vs Michigan State in Joe Louis and at Miami, meaning they went undefeated at Yost Ice Arena. In the first round, number one seeded Michigan defeated Alaska in a two-game sweep by scores of 8–1 and 11–0. In the second round, Michigan defeated number five seed Bowling Green 7–2. In the championship game, they defeated number three Michigan State 3–1.\nIn the 12-team 1997 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament as the number one seed in the west, after a first round bye the team defeated Minnesota 7–4 before losing in the semifinals to Boston University 3–2."

The head coach was Tom Izzo who was in his 12th year. The team played home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan. MSU finished the season 23–12, 8–8 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for seventh place. The Spartans received their tenth consecutive bid to the NCAA tournament where they lost in the Second Round to North Carolina.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2005–06 season 22–12, 8–8 in Big Ten play to finish in sixth place. Michigan State received an at-large bid as a No. 6 seed to the NCAA tournament, their ninth straight trip to the Tournament, and lost in the First Round.\nThe Spartans lost seniors Paul Davis (17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game), Maurice Ager (19.3 points per game) and junior Shannon Brown (17.2 points per game) to the NBA draft following the season.\nSeason summary.\nMSU was led by junior Drew Neitzel (18.1 points and 4.3 assist per game) and freshman Raymar Morgan (11.7 points and 5.2 rebounds per game).\nNon-conference.\nMSU started the season well with wins over Brown, Youngstown State, and The Citidel in East Lansing. The Spartans then participated in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic held at Madison Square Garden where they edged out No. 19 Texas in the semifinals on a Drew Neitzel last second basket. In the championship game, the Spartans lost on a controversial no-call of a shot clock violation allowing Maryland to maintain their lead and hold off the Spartans 62–59. Wins over Vermont and Oakland at Breslin Center led to a loss at Boston College in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge. MSU closed the non-conference schedule strong, winning their last seven games. However, the Spartans finished the non-conference slate 1–2 in their only trips outside the state of Michigan in the non-conference schedule. MSU finished the non-conference schedule with a record of 13–2, but was not ranked in the polls.\nBig Ten play.\nFollowing back-to-back losses to open the Big Ten season the prior year, the Spartans again suffered back-to-losses to open the season, this time on the road to Iowa and Indiana. The remaining Big Ten season was a roller coaster with a four-game winning streak immediately followed by a four-game losing streak and losses to Ohio State (ranked No. 4 and No. 5). A win against No. 1 Wisconsin highlighted the Big Ten season and likely assured the Spartans a trip to the NCAA Tournament. The Spartans finished 8–8 in the conference, finishing in a tie for seventh place. MSU lost to Wisconsin after beating Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament.\nNCAA Tournament.\nHelped by the win over No. 1 Wisconsin, the Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the 10th consecutive year, receiving a No. 9 seed, their lowest seed since 2002. A victory over Marquette, coached by former Izzo assistant Tom Crean, in the First Round of the Tournament was followed by a loss to No. 3 North Carolina in the Second Round.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nSource"

Held annually since 1982, the event crowns world champions in several divisions in the professional disc golf fields. Since 1983, male and female competitors have played at the same venue every year.\nThere have been 18 different Champions in the Men's event with an average field of 155 competitors, and 17 different Champions in the Women's event with an average field of 26. The event has been held in 19 US states as well as 1987 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nStarting in 2017 the Open Men's and Women's divisions began playing in one tournament, while the age-based divisions will play in a separate World Championships. Thus allowing the potential to be the world champion in both Open and an age-based division. In 2017, the \"Final 9\" round was eliminated from the Championship format. This was a card of the top 4 competitors, occasionally more, playing a 9-hole final round without any other competitors in the field.\nThe 2020 PDGA World Championships were cancelled on June 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the PDGA Professional Disc Golf World Championships in Odgen, Utah, the PDGA Junior Disc Golf World Championships in Emporia, Kansas, the PDGA Amateur Disc Golf Championships in Orlando, Florida, and the PDGA Professional Master Disc Golf Championships in Johnson City, Tennessee. \"All four events will run in the same host cities in 2021, with previously awarded 2021 World Championship bids moving back to 2022,\" announced the PDGA, citing international travel concerns, the inability to allow spectators, the member experience, and the difficulty of postponing the events as reasons for this decision. \"Rescheduling events now, with only two to three months of lead time to make these new arrangements and execute required contracts, puts a considerable strain on our partners. Pushing these decisions out by an additional month or more, with no clear end dates on international travel restrictions, will further hinder our hosts' abilities to successfully run these events.\"\nOn December 20, 2023, PDGA announced that the upcoming 2025 world championships will be held for the first time outside of North America in Finland, in the cities of Tampere and Nokia located in the Pirkanmaa region."

        "text": "The men's foil was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1956 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twelfth appearance of the event. The competition was held on 26 November 1956. 32 fencers from 14 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Christian d'Oriola of France, the second man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the foil and second man to win three medals in the event (he had a silver medal in 1948 along with gold in 1952). It was France's third consecutive and seventh overall victory in the event. As in 1952, the next two spots were taken by Italians, this time Giancarlo Bergamini and Antonio Spallino. \nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Four of the nine finalists from 1952 returned: gold medalist (and 1948 silver medalist) Christian d'Oriola of France, silver medalist Edoardo Mangiarotti of Italy, fourth-place finisher Jacques Lataste of France, and eighth-plae finisher Giancarlo Bergamini of Italy. Once again, the French and Italian teams were favored. D'Oriola had added two more world championships since the Helsinki Games and come in second at the third, behind József Gyuricza of Hungary.\nThe United Team of Germany made its debut in the men's foil. The United States made its 11th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nWith a smaller than usual field, the event used a three-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Barrages were used to break ties necessary for advancement (touches against were the first tie-breaker used to give ranks when the rank did not matter). However, only as much fencing was done as was necessary to determine advancement, so some bouts never occurred if the fencers advancing from the pool could be determined. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 4 fencers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nStratmann won the barrage vs. Mangiarotti, 5–4.\nQuarterfinal 3.\nDelaunois beat Paul, who beat Bergamini, who beat Delaunois, in the barrage, all at 5–4; touches against in the main pool were used to break the tie.\nSemifinals.\nThe top 4 fencers in each pool advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe three-way barrage for 3rd and 4th places resulted in Stratmann losing twice to be eliminated. Gyuricza and Jay did not face each other in the barrage, with their nominal 3rd and 4th place ranks (not relevant to advancement) determined on touches against in the main pool.\nFinal.\nThe two Italian fencers faced off in a barrage to determine silver and bronze medals. Bergamini won, 5–4 (he had also beaten Spallino by that score in the main pool)."

        "text": "The men's team foil was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1956 Summer Olympics programme. It was the ninth appearance of the event. The competition was held 23 November 1956. 50 fencers from 9 nations competed.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a pool play format, with each team facing the other teams in the pool in a round robin. Each match consisted of 16 bouts, with 4 fencers on one team facing each of the 4 fencers on the other team. Bouts were to 5 touches. Total touches against were the tie-breaker if a match was tied 8 bouts to 8. However, only as much fencing was done as was necessary to determine advancement, so some matches never occurred and some matches were stopped before the full 16 bouts were fenced if the teams advancing from the pool could be determined.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top two nations in each pool advanced to the semifinal.\nPool 1.\nIn the first match, Belgium defeated the Soviet Union 9–7. The Soviet Union then defeated France 9–7. The third match ended when France took a 10–4 lead over Belgium, ensuring that all teams would finish 1–1 and Belgium would necessarily lose the three-way tie based on individual bouts.\nPool 2.\nIn the first match, Great Britain defeated Colombia 15–1. In the second, Italy reached 9 wins without a loss against Colombia to win the match; because this put Colombia at 0–2 and guaranteed advancement for the other two teams, the Italy–Colombia match was halted.\nPool 3.\nIn the first match, the United States defeated Australia 13–3. In the second, Hungary and Australia each won 8 bouts, but Hungary prevailed on touches against (57–65). This eliminated Australia at 0–2 and advanced the other two teams, so the United States did not face Hungary.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two teams in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nSemifinal 1.\nIn the first match, the United States defeated Great Britain 9–7. In the second, Italy and Great Britain tied: not only in bouts, 8–8, but in touches, 56–56. For the third and final match, then, Italy needed only to do better against the United States than Great Britain had; as soon as Italy won its 8th bout against the United States (leading the match 8–4), the pool was finished. That the United States could still have come back to win against Italy was immaterial; those two would advance regardless, with Great Britain eliminated.\nSemifinal 2.\nHungary (11–5) and France (9–4) each defeated the Soviet Union, with the French–Soviet match stopped as soon as France reached 9 wins due to the certainty of the Soviet Union's elimination.\nFinal.\nThe first two pairings saw France defeat the United States (10–6) and Italy beat Hungary (8–8, 59–63). France and Italy each won again in the second pairings, this time France over Hungary (11–5) and Italy against the United States (9–7). With two 2–0 teams and two 0–2 teams, the third set of pairings in the round-robin were effectively a gold medal match and a bronze medal match. Hungary defeated the United States 9–5 to take the bronze medal, while Italy prevailed over France 9–7 for the gold."

        "text": "The men's épée was one of seven fencing events on the fencing at the 1956 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twelfth appearance of the event. The competition was held on 30 November 1956. 41 fencers from 18 nations competed. Nations were limited to three fencers each. The event was won by Carlo Pavesi of Italy, the nation's fifth consecutive victory in the men's épée (most among all nations, above France with three). In all five of those Games, Italy earned at least two medals in the event; this was the second sweep during that period for Italy (and fifth overall, with Cuba achieving that once and France twice). Giuseppe Delfino was the silver medalist while Edoardo Mangiarotti took bronze. It was Mangiarotti's third medal in the event, along with gold in 1952 and another bronze in 1948; he was the first man to win three medals in the individual épée.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFive of the 10 finalists from the 1952 Games returned: gold medalist (and 1948 bronze medalist) Edoardo Mangiarotti of Italy, fifth-place finisher József Sákovics of Hungary, sixth-place finisher Carlo Pavesi of Italy, seventh-place finisher Per Carleson of Sweden, and eighth-place finisher Carl Forssell of Sweden. The reigning (1955) World Champion, Giorgio Anglesio of Italy, was on the Italian team for the team event but did not compete in the individual event, with Mangiarotti (a two-time World Champion as well as two-time Olympic medalist), Pavesi, and Giuseppe Delfino making up the nation's heavily favored three-man squad for the individual competition.\nIndonesia made its debut in the event. East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. Belgium and the United States each appeared for the 11th time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a pool play format, with each fencer facing the other fencers in the pool in a round robin. For the first time, bouts were to 5 touches. Barrages were used to break ties necessary for advancement (touches against were the first tie-breaker used to give ranks when the rank did not matter). However, only as much fencing was done as was necessary to determine advancement, so some bouts never occurred if the fencers advancing from the pool could be determined. The smaller field resulted in fewer pools and smaller pools (the final was only 8 fencers for the first time since 1912, after decades at 10 or 12 fencers).\nFencers from the four nations that reached the team event final received byes to the quarterfinals.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top 4 fencers in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals. Fencers from the four teams that advanced to the final of the men's team épée event received byes through round 1:\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top 4 fencers in each pool advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe top 4 fencers in each pool advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe three-way tie among the Italian fencers for the medals at 5–2 required a barrage to settle. The first barrage resulted in another three-way tie at 1–1 (Pavesi defeated Delfino; Delfino defeated Mangiarotti; Mangiarotti defeated Pavesi). In the second barrage, the results were the same except Pavesi defeated Mangiarotti to win the gold medal. Delfino took silver and Mangiarotti bronze. In all, Mangiarotti had faced Delfino 4 times (Mangiarotti winning in the semifinal pool, Delfino winning three times: the final pool and both barrages), Delfino had faced Pavesi 3 times (Pavesi winning all 3 in the final pool and both barrages), and Pavesi had faced Mangiarotti 3 times (Mangiarotti winning in the final pool and first barrage, Pavesi winning in the second barrage)."

The competition was held on 5 December 1956. 35 fencers from 17 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Rudolf Kárpáti, the seventh of nine straight Games in which a Hungarian would win the event. Jerzy Pawłowski of Poland took silver and Lev Kuznetsov of the Soviet Union took bronze, the first medals in the event for each nation and the first time since 1924 that any nation other than Hungary and Italy earned a medal in the men's sabre.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Four of the nine finalists from 1952 returned: gold medalist (and 1948 bronze medalist) Pál Kovács of Hungary, silver medalist (and 1948 gold and 1936 bronze medalist) Aladár Gerevich of Hungary, fourth-place finisher Gastone Darè of Italy, and sixth-place finisher Jacques Lefèvre of France. The last three world champions were on the heavily favored Hungarian team: 1953 champion Kovács (who had also won in 1937), 1954 champion Rudolf Kárpáti, and 1955 champion Gerevich (also in 1935 and 1951).\nColombia, Indonesia, and Luxembourg each made their debut in the men's sabre; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany. Italy made its 11th appearance in the event, most of any nation (surpassing Denmark, which missed the men's sabre event for the first time since competing in 1908), having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 St. Louis Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a pool play format, with each fencer facing the other fencers in the pool in a round robin.

        "text": "Brooklyn Rugby Football Club, is a Rugby Union club founded in 2007 and based in Brooklyn, New York. The club competes in the Empire Geographic Union and is a member of USA Rugby. The Women's team plays at the Division II level and the Men's team plays at Division III level. \nClub History.\nFounding.\nBrooklyn Rugby Football Club was founded in 2007 by a small group of former college and club players looking to build a competitive and community-oriented club in the borough of Brooklyn. At the time, New York City was serviced by several clubs within the 5 boroughs including NYAC Rugby, Old Blue, The Village Lions, Landsdown Rugby, Rockaway, and Old Maroon. There were, however, no rugby teams in the city's largest borough of Brooklyn.\nIn the Fall of 2007, the core group of players, who would start the club, played that season for the NY Americans (who later merged with another club to form the Kingston Mad Dogs). Since the travel to games for the NY Americans was becoming cost-prohibitive, the core members got together and started a club in Brooklyn, which would later be named Brooklyn Rugby Football Club.\nIn the early days, the club was fully sponsored by Barons Brewing Company of Sydney, Australia and, in line with this sponsorship, was named the Brooklyn Barons Rugby Football Club. Barons eventually pulled their sponsorship in light of the economic downturn in 2008 and the club re-branded itself as Brooklyn Rugby Football Club, the name of the club to this day.\nThe club started its history in the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union Division III, which is the fourth tier of United States Rugby.\nMerging With the Women's Club.\nIn 2014 the Brooklyn Rugby Football Club and the Brooklyn Women's Rugby Football Club, two separate clubs throughout their histories, merged and became one club with one governing body. The club known as Brooklyn Rugby Football Club now provides rugby playing opportunities to all genders in the Brooklyn area.\nFounding Women's Members.\nBrooklyn Women's Rugby Club was founded in 2007.\nMen's Team History.\nMike Haynes Era.\nBrooklyn Rugby started its first league season with coach and founder Michael Haynes at the helm and Captain Geoffrey Gordon leading the team on the field. Fellow core founding members Justin Knight, Keyth Weiss, and Joshua Magnas helped fill out the inaugural team.\nIn 2008, Brooklyn Rugby finished in 2nd place in their inaugural Fall season. The team ultimately lost in the Final to eventual NRU champions Danbury Rugby Club, who went on to be promoted to Division II. The team showed a high level of competitiveness in their first league season and were an early favorite to win the championship in 2009.\nIn the spring of 2009, Brooklyn Rugby secured its first two pieces of hardware, winning both the Four Leaf 15's Tournament hosted by the Village Lions and the North Bay Grey Ghost Cup hosted by North Bay rugby.\nIn the 2009 campaign, Brooklyn Rugby lost two games in the regular season but secured a playoff berth thanks to a last-minute penalty goal against Hudson Valley. In the playoffs, Brooklyn Rugby avenged their regular season loss to Rockaway Rugby Football Club on Rockaway's home field. Brooklyn eventually lost in the Met Union Final to eventual NRU champions North Jersey RFC. This was Brooklyn's second year in the final in as many Fall seasons, an excellent record for a new club.\nUndefeated Season.\nBrooklyn Rugby came into the 2010 season as one of the favorites to finish in first place. On October 21, 2010, Brooklyn Rugby completed an undefeated season with a 59-0 home win over The Rockland Rogues. The undefeated regular season included a 15-10 away win over rival Rockaway, however, Rockaway were to overturn this result in the D3 Championship final 23-14. Brooklyn still earned the 5th seed in the NRU playoffs which meant that Brooklyn had to travel to Boston to play MIT in the first round. After a back and forth game Brooklyn was able to win a tough game on the road 15-14. The result gave Brooklyn their first NRU playoff victory and granted them entry to the Northeast Final Four, along with rival Rockaway, Saratoga and Brooklyn's semi-final opponent the Syracuse Chargers. Brooklyn would lose its semi-final encounter with Syracuse but would come out strong in the consolation game against Saratoga to secure 3rd place in the NRU, Brooklyn best finish in its history.\n2nd Mike Haynes Era.\n2011 saw the return of founding coach Mike Haynes to the team as the head coach with the retirement of Tri Do. Brooklyn's 2011 spring season saw a competitive schedule with some positive results against top tier opponents but were denied promotion by the union. Brooklyn Rugby Football club were informed that they would remain in DIII for the upcoming Fall 2011 season.\nIn August 2011 it was announced that Brooklyn Rugby FC's new main sponsor would be the Black Grouse, a brand in the family of Scotch Wiskey produced by the Edrington Group, makers of The Famous Grouse. Brooklyn Rugby's crest was changed to reflect this new relationship as the rugby ball in the upper let hand quadrant of the crest was changed to an image of a Grouse.\n2011 saw Brooklyn Rugby have another successful regular season campaign finishing the season with 5 victories and 1 loss, including a home win over top ranked Montclair RFC. For the 2nd straight year Brooklyn rugby would host a home semifinal against Suffolk RFC, who had beaten Brooklyn for the first time in their history in the regular season. The Semi-Final was played in a winter Noreaster but the players fought through the freezing rain a snow to play the game, which was won by Brooklyn 10-0. Brooklyn would meet Montclair in the final, Brooklyn's fourth in as many years. Brooklyn were out matched on the day by a clinical and physical Montclair side and lost the final 41-10.\nEmpire GU and Jeff Dincher Era.\n2012 Saw Brooklyn Rugby take the field in a more competitive and restructured Division III under the newly formed Empire GU. The season was the first in charge for new head coach Jeff Dincher. Brooklyn RFC dropped their first two games of the season. A loss to Old Blue in the season opener and a lopsided loss to yearly league rival Suffolk at their home field. Brooklyn RFC would bounce back though with successive wins over Rockland RFC and Old Maroon. Brooklyn RFC's next match was a tough test against newly relegated side North Jersey. The team comported themselves well with a 12-12 draw at Nojo's home turf. Brooklyn would finish the season with a tough road draw to a much improved Hudson Valley side and a lop sided win over city rival Gotham Knights. The season was a tough one in the standings for Brooklyn RFC as they finished 4th and missed the playoffs.\nDivision restructure and Daniel Newcombe Era.\nAfter a series of friendlies in the Spring season of 2013, Jeff Dincher stepped down as coach of Brooklyn Rugby. His departure coincided with a number of changes being made to the Empire GU's league structure, particularly in the lower divisions. The changes that affected Brooklyn the most were new teams (formerly from D2 of the Empire GU) entering the division. Furthermore, league matches were now to be contested across both the fall and spring seasons - previously all league activity took place in the fall. In the absence of a new coach, player and former captain Daniel Newcombe stepped in as coach of the team, while continuing his position as a hooker for the club. Newcombe was joined on the coaching staff by former player Jason Maschi, joining as the attacking play coach, and former coach Jeff Dincher, who joined as the club's defensive play coach.\nBrooklyn's inaugural season in the restructured Division III South started promisingly with away wins over Montauk and Connecticut Yankees. These successive victories were followed by a tough 7 - 14 loss to league leaders Lansdowne RFC, an unfortunate 10 - 7 away defeat to local rivals Rockaway, a lopsided 38 - 5 to second-placed Old Blue and a tough away visit to Danbury that resulted in a score of 36 - 17 to the home team. Galvanized by this string of losses, Brooklyn finished out the first half of their 2013/14 league season with a decisive 50 - 0 victory over Hudson Valley. The league season restarted in March 2014 with a 22 - 0 win over Suffolk in extremely adverse weather conditions. A closely fought contest against NoJo followed, with a final score of 13 - 10 to Brooklyn. This win was notable due to it being the first time the club had beaten NoJo in regular league play. Brooklyn's final result of the 2013-14 league season was a 21 - 17 win over Bayonne, meaning the club finished the second half of their league season undefeated. Overall, Brooklyn finished 4th out of 11 in the division, an improvement on the previous year given the increased size of the division and tougher competition.\nHonors.\nEmpire Geographic Union/Metropolitan Rugby Football Union.\nDivision III Championship\nPlayoff Runner-up (4) - 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011\nRegular Season Titles (1) - 2010\nNortheast Rugby Football Union.\nDivision III\nPlayoff Berths - 2008, 2009, 2010\nTournaments.\n4 Leaf 15's Tournament NYC\nParticipant - 2009, 2011\nSocial Division Champions - 2009\nNorth Bay Grey Ghost Cup - Maryland\nParticipant - 2009, 2010\nTournament Champions - 2009\nLong Island Mother's Day Tournament\nParticipant - 2007, 2008, 2011\nRunners Up (1) - 2011\nCAN-AMS Rugby Tournament\nParticipant - 2011-2013\nConsolation Champions - 2013\nInternational Tours.\nTurks and Caicos 2012:\nResults:\nTCIRFC President's XV 10 - Brooklyn Rugby 5\nTCIRFC First XV 27 - Brooklyn Rugby 0\nWomen's Team History.\nThe Women's team was established in 2007 by Jaimee Lynn Nelson and joined the Men's team in 2014 to form Brooklyn Rugby Club. \nSince, they have played consistently in the Empire GU Division II league, fielding 15s teams for Fall (competitive season), and Spring (social season).

        "text": "The ACU British Motocross Championship (abbreviated to MXGB and currently known for sponsorship reasons as the Dirt Store ACU British Motocross Championship) is the premier Motocross series in the United Kingdom.\nThe championship is recognised as being the official British championship in the sport of Motocross by the ACU. It is currently under the stewardship of promoter RHL Activities.\nHistory.\nThere is uncertainty about the origins of motocross, but it is likely that it began in 1914 when the Scott Trial was started by Alfred Angas Scott, owner and founder of The Scott Motorcycle Company. The Scott Trial was held on the Yorkshire moors in Northern England and after World War I test riders of new British motorcycles started racing against each other on off-road factory courses. The French came up with the term 'moto cross' to describe this off-road racing and the first recorded Motocross competition was on Camberley Heath in Surrey, England on 29 March 1924.\nClasses.\nThe British Motocross Championship competition is organised into classes of MX1 and MX2. MX1 is for 251cc to 450cc (fourstroke) and MX2 for 175cc to 250cc 4-stroke motorcycles or 120cc to 250cc 2-stroke motorcycles.\nIn addition to the senior classes, several youth classes take place across each round in support of the series, forming the British Youth Motocross Championship. These include the 250cc, 125cc, Big-Wheel 85cc, Small-Wheel 85cc and 65cc classes.\nThe British Women's Motocross Championship, with a supporting youth class, was also revived upon the beginning of the stewardship of current promoter RHL Activities. However, this was discontinued before the start of the 2022 season due to lack of entries.\nA 'Veterans' series was introduced in 2009 with just two rounds. This class was later discontinued and does not form part of the British Motocross Championship.\nAuto-Cycle Union.\nThe Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) is the governing body of the British Motocross Championship. The ACU sets the rules for the British Motocross Championship and organises the training of stewards and marshals to ensure track safety. The ACU also sets and checks safety standards and tracks the progress of national championships. The ACU has an important role to defend and develop motorcycle sport and is independent of any commercial organisation.\nSponsorship.\nThe British Motocross Championship currently has a title sponsor with Dirt Store UK, a partnership that commenced in 2024."

The tournament was hosted by Ateneo de Manila University. ABS-CBN covered the games on Studio 23.\nAfter a UAAP Board decision that upheld the UE Red Warriors' protest against the DLSU Green Archers, three teams ended tied for first after the elimination round. By virtue of having the superior point differential from games among the tied teams, the defending champions Ateneo Blue Eagles secured the #1 seed; the FEU Tamaraws defeated UE in the second-seed playoff in a virtual game one of a best-of-3 series. Ateneo needed their twice-to-beat advantage to outlast La Salle in a fight-marred series to advance to the Finals, while FEU needed one game to eliminate a stubborn UE team. In the Finals, FEU coach Koy Banal led the team to victory over a tired Ateneo team coached by his brother Joel to win FEU's first UAAP men's basketball championship since 1997.\nUE's James Yap was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the season. Arwind Santos was named Finals MVP.\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nSecond seed playoff.\nSince Ateneo, FEU and UE finished the eliminations with identical 11-3 cards, the quotient system was used. Ateneo emerged with the best quotient among the three, so UE and FEU figured out for a playoff game for the second seed to determine which team will clinch the twice-to-beat advantage that goes along with it, leading to a \"de facto\" first game of a best-of-three series. The winner only has to win once in the series, while the loser have to win twice to qualify for the Finals.\nUE fell behind by as much as 18 points in the fourth quarter, but caught up with FEU due to their trapping defense. Olan Omiping hit a shot to start a 21–4 UE run, that was ended by RJ Masbang when he scored on a three-point play to cut FEU's lead to one point. Denok Miranda and Mark Isip initiated a 5–0 FEU run when UE coach Boyzie Zamar benched Masbang for shooter Charles Tan, who turned the ball over and fouled Santos that caused a three-point play to put FEU up by eight points. Up by three points, Santos tipped-in a Miranda miss to seal the win for FEU and the #2 seed.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;*Number of asterisks denotes the number of overtime periods.&lt;section end=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nFEU and Ateneo have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) Ateneo vs. (4) La Salle.\nGame 1.\nWith former Chicago Bulls player Scott Burrell at court side, Ateneo led for much of the game; La Salle top scorer Mark Cardona was injured. La Salle's Joseph Yeo led the Archers back into the game; Jerwin Gaco scored on a put-back after a La Salle miss to force overtime. With 1:31 left in the overtime period, a bench-clearing brawl erupted after Gaco bumped LA Tenorio after a loose-ball scramble. Slo-mo replays later showed Tenorio sneaked in a punch to Gaco's side. After commissioner Joe Lipa and Araneta Coliseum personnel restored order, referees thrown out Ateneo's Magnum Membrere and La Salle's Ryan Araña. Yeo, who scored 31 points, and JV Casio led La Salle at the end of overtime to extend the series.\nGame 2.\nAfter the fracas at their first semifinals game, Tenorio was suspended. This gave Macky Escalona Tenorio's starting point-guard spot. Cardona, who was dressed to play, was not fielded in by La Salle coach Franz Pumaren. At the end of the first half, a commotion broke out between the two teams in the Araneta Coliseum tunnel as they went to their respective locker rooms. At the stands, there were at least three incidents of shoving, punching and debris-throwing involving officials and supporters. Lipa ordered a certain fan to be expelled after having a word war with the Ateneo supporters. Midway through the third quarter, Ateneo led 47–33 but La Salle crept up. At the fourth quarter, as Ateneo's shot clock was running out, center Paolo Bugia made an improbable three-pointer to pad their lead 63–59. Larry Fonacier scored six straight points in the final 61 seconds to put Ateneo up for good; after Joseph Yeo scored on a three-pointer to cut Ateneo's lead 71–68, Fonacier made two free-throws off Cabatu's unsportsmanlike foul to put them up by five points. A last-ditch foul from Casio on Macky Escalona settled the final score as Escalona split his free-throws.\nAt the end of the game, another scuffle between the supporters broke out, and included former Ateneo players Enrico Villanueva, Rainier Sison and Andrew Cruz; both Sison and Cruz suffered bruises. Uniformed policemen, including the SWAT team, and Araneta Coliseum security guards restored order.\n(2) FEU vs. (3) UE.\nFEU and UE were locked in a close game until the final minutes. Paul Artadi scored a three-pointer to put the Red Warriors up 61–60. RJ Rizada and Gerald Jones scored baskets late in the game to eliminate the Red Warriors anew.\nFinals.\nIn the finals, defending champion Ateneo coach Joel Banal faced his brother, FEU coach Koy.\nGame 1.\nAteneo threatened to blow the game wide open in the first quarter, but FEU responded with defense that gave Ateneo few easy points. The Tamaraws grabbed rebounds that led into easy fast break points to cruise to an easy win to lead the best-of-3 series 1–0.\nGame 2.\nFEU led for most of the game, with Cesar Catli, RJ Rizada and Rhagnee Singco scoring baskets to increase FEU's lead 39–26. Ateneo cut the lead 46–39 near the end of the third quarter thanks to Larry Fonacier's free-throws. However, Jeffrei Chan scored on a three-point shot to increase FEU's lead to ten to end the quarter. At the start of the fourth quarter, FEU led for good, 56–39, after a Gerald Jones shot. The Eagles threatened anew late in the fourth, but Dennis Miranda converted a three-point shot with 2:31 left to put the Eagles away, 63–50. FEU won their first UAAP men's basketball championship since 1997.\nBroadcast notes.\nUAAP Final Four.\nSeptember 25, 2003\nSeptember 30, 2003\nAwards.\nThe awards were given out prior to Game 2 at the Araneta Coliseum:"

The tournament was hosted by National University. ABS-CBN covered the games on Studio 23.\nFour-time defending champion De La Salle Green Archers were on their way on scoring a rare 14–0 sweep of the elimination round when they were stopped by the Ateneo Blue Eagles in their last game of the elimination round. The UE Red Warriors won over the UST Growling Tigers on the elimination round finale to secure the #2 seed against Ateneo in the semifinals. UST were blown out by La Salle in their semifinals series, while Ateneo won twice against UE, the deciding game via last-second shot from Gec Chia, to face La Salle in the Finals, a rematch of the previous season's championship series. In Game 1, Ateneo upset the Green Archers, but La Salle tied the series on the next game. In the deciding Game 3, Ateneo pulled away late in the fourth quarter to win their first title since 1988.\nAteneo's Enrico Villanueva was named Most Valuable Player, while teammates Larry Fonacier and Wesley Gonzales were named co-MVPs of the Finals.\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nWith a 14–0 sweep giving them a bye up to the best-of-3 finals, La Salle won their first thirteen games; their last game was against arch rival Ateneo. The two teams were locked 43–all when Wesley Gonzales, Rich Alvarez, Larry Fonacier and Andrew Cruz engineered a 21–3 run to put Ateneo up 64–46 with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. Alvarez scored on a slam dunk to give Ateneo the biggest lead of the game, 73–53 with 3:13 left.

The lead reached 26 points in the third quarter. The Tigers cut the lead to 59–72 with a 7–0 run at the start of the fourth quarter, and another time, this time with an 11-point lead with a 78–89 scoreline, but La Salle's lead was too big for the Tigers to overcome.\n(2) UE vs. (3) Ateneo.\nGame 1.\nAteneo defeated UE to extend their series to a deciding second game. While Most Valuable Player (MVP) candidate James Yap was limited to only four points by the Ateneo defense, returning LA Tenorio (who was previously injured with a hand injury) led the decisive run that increased Ateneo's lead to 11 points to prevent their elimination.\nGame 2.\nThe deciding game would also go down to the wire; Gec Chia turned over the ball to UE, where James Yap converted at the other end to put the Red Warriors up, 70–68. Chia would later score to force the game's seventh and last deadlock with 35 seconds left. Yap missed a three-pointer on the ensuing possession, Jay-arr Estrada grabbed the rebound but Paul Artadi committed a turnover. With Ateneo now having the possession with 7.8 seconds remaining, LA Tenorio dribbled the entire length of the court to find his path blocked by two UE players. Off a pick from Enrico Villanueva, Chia scored a 15-foot jump shot to win the game for Ateneo and eliminate UE from contention.\nFinals.\nGame 1.\nAteneo kept pace with La Salle throughout much of the game, with the Green Archers leading by as much as eight and the Eagles giving up hairline leads. Late in the game, LA Tenorio missed both free-throws, but drew an offensive foul from Mike Cortez to give Ateneo the possession with 39.3 seconds left. Rich Alvarez missed consecutive shots, but Enrico Villanueva split his free-throws to put Ateneo up by two points with 9.2 seconds remaining. In the ensuing possession, Mark Cardona attempted a field goal twice but was blocked each time by Larry Fonacier as time expired to give Ateneo a 1–0 series lead.\nGame 2.\nAfter the first game, La Salle coach Franz Pumaren talked to Mike Cortez where he reminded him that as a veteran, he should lead by example to his teammates. La Salle started strongly, leading 50–32, capped off a slam dunk from Cortez off an Ateneo turnover. The Blue Eagles will cut the deficit to nine points at 64–55, but Cortez scored each time to prevent Ateneo from cutting the lead even further. With La Salle up 78–73, Fonacier scored on a put-back; Adonis Sta. Maria scored at the other end to restore the 5-point lead, with 65 seconds left. Enrico Villanueva scored via two free-throws, but Carlo Sharma scored two points also from the free-throw line. LA Tenorio drove hard to the basket but missed; Santa Maria was fouled on the rebound attempt. Santa Maria made both free-throws, Cortez caught the airball from Fonacier's three-pointer, was fouled, and split his free-throws to end the game. La Salle evened the series and forced a deciding games off Cortez' 21 points.\nGame 3.\nAteneo led for much of the game via small margins, when LA Tenorio made successive three-point shots and Wesley Gonzales made a lay-up to give Ateneo a 10-point 64–54 lead; the two players would later leave the game due to fouls for the former and cramps from the latter. Sonny Tadeo and Epok Quimpo scored on a 5-point run to add Ateneo's lead to eleven points with barely over two minutes left. Adonis Santa Maria narrowed the gap to 66–73 but Villanueva made it a 9-point lead after being fouled by Santa Maria during a rebound play off Fonacier's miss. Santa Maria and BJ Manalo scored a 4–0 run, but Fonacier scored on the free-throw line off a Cortez to foul to win the championship for Ateneo, their first since their consecutive title run from 1987 to 1988, and denying La Salle to set a new record of a 5th-consecutive men's title in the Final Four era.\nBroadcast notes.\nUAAP Final Four.\nSeptember 19, 2002\nSeptember 22, 2002\nAwards.\nThe awards were given out prior to Game 2 at the Araneta Coliseum:"

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1890 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire had been playing twenty years. Derbyshire's matches were not considered to be first class in this season. Derbyshire had recruited Fred Spofforth a former Australian captain to help revive the club's fortunes. Spofforth was successful off the field in uncovering irregularities that contributed to the financial difficulties that had bedevilled the club for many years.\n1890 season.\nDerbyshire played fourteen games, winning seven and losing five. They played the same county teams as in previous years and also minor county Norfolk for the first time. They also played against MCC and the touring Australians. Fred Spofforth, known as the \"Demon Bowler\" had toured England with the Australians in 1886, and afterwards chose to live in Derbyshire. With the residential qualification met in 1890, Spofforth was able not only to play for Derbyshire but to captain the side. Although the Demon Bowler took 9 for 56 against Leicestershire, it was George Davidson who took most wickets. Levi Wright was top scorer. Derbyshire did not have had a dedicated wicket-keeper during the season.\nWicket Keeper.\nThere does not appear to have been a regular wicket-keeper this season, and no wickets were taken by stumping.\nFinancial scandal.\nBy 1890 Derbyshire County Cricket Club was found to be in deep financial crisis. Fred Spofforth played a key part in identifying a fraud that had been committed. The cricket club's losses amounted to £1000 and Derby County Football Club was also raided. In 1880 Samuel Richardson, the club's first captain had become an administrator of the club, and in 1884 the remit was extended to the associated Derby County Football Club. Richardson admitted his guilt, fled the country in disgrace and settled in Madrid."

The tournaments are divided into two divisions: the Juniors tournament for male high school students, and the Seniors tournament for male college students.\nColegio de San Juan de Letran hosted the season, starting with an opening ceremony held at the Araneta Coliseum on June 25, 2005 followed by a double-header. Games in the elimination rounds and semifinals then are subsequently held at the Cuneta Astrodome, with the Finals played at the Araneta. Men's games are aired lived by ABS-CBN Sports via Studio 23.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nPostseason teams.\nThe Knights had an amazing streak of eleven straight wins right from opening day. The streak was threatened when they faced fellow unbeaten team, the PCU Dolphins, at the end of the first round. Both sporting 6-0 records, the game went into overtime, and Boyet Bautista and John Paul Alcaraz saved the day for the Knights beat the Dolphins resulting a first round sweep.\nThe streak ended when the Mapua Cardinals, led by the former All-Canadian Kelvin dela Peña beat the Knights as Letran failed to stop dela Peña and collapsed at the end game.(If Letran won that 2nd round game against Mapua, the Knights could have already scored a 14-0 sweep of the eliminations) The Knights recovered as they blew out the Stags, and swept the regular season series vs. PCU in the season finale.\nThe defending champions PCU Dolphins also had their own 6-0 streak, beating Mapua and CSB. But it was ended by Letran (see above) in a tight contest.\nThen came the shock loss against the San Beda Red Lions under San Beda's debuting coach Koy Banal. The Dolphins bounced back, beating last year's runner-up UPHSD Altas. However, PCU was defeated by the San Sebastian Stags in their second round rematch. On the next game, they clinched the twice to beat advantage when they beat Mapua. However, they failed to beat Letran in the regular season.\nThe Mapua Cardinals had their best start in fourteen years as they boasted a 4-0 card. But losses against defending champions PCU Dolphins and Intramuros arch rivals Letran dropped their record to 4-2. A buzzer-beater by Neil Pascual off a Kelvin dela Peña pass against the CSB Blazers kept their Final Four hopes alive. But successive loses against underachievering teams Perpetual Altas and JRU Heavy Bombers put the Final Four aspirations in doubt.\nAfter successive wins against the San Beda Red Lions and CSB Blazers, the Cardinals found confidence in their game, and they beat the then undefeated Letran Knights under the heroics of Kelvin dela Peña and Joferson Gonzales. PCU defeated them again in the eliminations, depriving the Cardinals for a twice to beat advantage in the semis. Mapua bounced back and scored a victory against the Stags. (It can be said that if the Cardinals have beaten the Bombers and the Altas, then they would have been seeded as second, armed with a twice-to-beat advantage in the Semifinals and could've been in the Finals.)\nAfter failing to enter the Final Four for the first time since its inception in 1998, the Stags are itching to bring back the glory to their school. With 2003 NCAA MVP Leomar Najorda and Redentor Vicente, the Stags look poised to barge back into the Final Four. But with a disappointing 0-3 start, the Stags needed to win against the then undefeated CSB Blazers (3-0). Under the exploits of Najorda and Vicente, the Stags won the game.\nThe rest of season was a roller-coaster ride, with San Sebastian winning games against weaker teams. But a win against the PCU Dolphins finally sealed their Final Four appearance.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's playoffs\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nLetran and PCU have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) Letran vs. (4) San Sebastian.\nThe Knights, which had previously routed the Stags in their two elimination round games, dealt their opponents a 32–6 fourth quarter run that blew the game wide open and eliminated San Sebastian from championship contention. The Knights qualified for their second Finals stint in three years.\n(2) PCU vs. (3) Mapua.\nWith the game tied 49–all at the start of the fourth quarter, the Dolphins staged a 21–2 with last year's Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Rob Sanz scoring key three-pointers to erect a 72–51 advantage at the final two minutes. The defending champions qualified for their second consecutive Finals stint, against Letran, whom they eliminated the previous year in the semifinals in two games.\nFinals.\nLetran and PCU started their two-year rivalry in the 2004 tournament, when the Dolphins eliminated the Knights in the do-or-die semifinal game that went into overtime via former Knight Ronjay Enrile's flubbed freethrows. The Dolphins then beat 2004's first seed UPHDS Altas in two games, taking their first NCAA seniors basketball title.\nTrailing 65–70 late in Game 1 when Gabby Espinas fouled out, Jayson Castro and Sanz each had a three-pointer in the deciding 11–0 PCU run to put the Dolphins ahead, 76–70 with less than five minutes left. After Jonathan Alvade made a field-goal to cut the lead to three at 74–77, the Dolphins defense prevented another Letran scoring opportunity the rest of the way as they held on to stun the Knights, which had only one loss in the season prior to the game.\nIn an elimination game for Letran, they scored 25 points in the second quarter to erect a 44–33 lead at halftime. They increased their lead to a commanding 54–33 lead after preventing the Dolphins from scoring in the first five minutes of the third quarter. The Dolphins will cut the lead to fourteen, but that was the nearest they were able to get as the Knights tied the series to force a deciding Game 3.\nLetran and PCU were locked in a tight contest at the first quarter, although the Dolphins never led; Letran's Boyet Bautista hit a running three-pointer at the end of the first quarter to prevent the Dolphins from getting close. In the second quarter, Letran twice led by as many as ten points, but the Dolphins limited the Knights to 5 points and a single field-goal to cut Letran's lead. PCU would eventually stare at a 43–41 deficit at the start of the fourth quarter, but Bautista scored on a lay-up that prevent further PCU incursions as the Knights cruised to the victory, and their second championship in three years. Bautista would be named as Finals MVP as he led Letran to their 16th men's basketball title.\nAwards.\nIn what was billed as one of the league's closest and most interesting MVP races, former volleyball star Ernie Jay Sagad won MVP honors, defeating last year's MVP and Rookie of the Year Gabby Espinas.\nNCAA Players of the Week.\nStarting on the 2005-06 Season, the NCAA Press Corps has awarded the NCAA Player of the Week award to the most outstanding basketball player in a given week.\nJuniors' tournament.\nElimination round.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' standings\" /&gt;\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Juniors' playoffs\" /&gt;"

Prior to the relay, a lighting ceremony was held back on October 9, 2010. Some 2,068 torchbearers were expected to carry the torch. The relay leg in Harbin was held in a minor scale due the climatic conditions,as the leg was held inside the main venue of the 1996 Asian Winter Games complex, the Harbin Ice Hockey Rink, while the relay on October 22, 2010 was affected by Typhoon Megi as it was held under the rain. The leg held from November 6–8 acted as a test relay.

The secondary official mark of the torch relay was unveiled on July 15, 2010, featuring a silhouette of a running goat holding a torch.\nLighting ceremony.\nOn October 9, 2010, the flame lighting ceremony was held at the Juyongguan pass at the Great Wall of China near Beijing. A 22-year-old Yunnan Arts University student Kang Chen-chen () was chosen to light the torch. The condition at the time of the lighting was foggy, while she tried to light the torch with a solar mirror with little sunlight. Therefore, it took upwards of 2 minutes before the torch flame could come up. Kang received quite a bit of media attention afterwards. Most of it praised the way she handled the situation. The ceremonial cauldron was then lit-up by president Hu Jintao."

Weather gave two events run at these games problems, creating the largest margin of victory in Olympic history for one and the cancellation of the other.\nDuring the Olympics.\nThe 50 km cross-country skiing event took place on 14 February around the hills of St. Moritz with time markers at Silvaplan (), Sils (), Plaun da Lei (), Maloja (), Isola (), Fex (), and Surlej () before returning to St. Moritz. There was an ) change in elevation during the 50 km race. The race was also unusual in the sense of the extreme change in weather when it started at nearly and ended at . It would produce the largest margin of victory in Olympic history with Sweden's Per-Erik Hedlund beating fellow Swede Gustaf Jonsson by 13 minutes and 27 seconds.\nOn that same day in the 10,000 m speed skating event at the ice rink, the event was stopped 2000 meters into the fifth and final pair due to thawing ice. Officials in charge ordered the day's times cancelled and the races rerun. The problem was that by the time the decision was reached to rerun the event, Norway had made it clear that American Irving Jaffee was event champion and had left for their home country. The contest was cancelled as a result. Skaters involved in the event considered it settled when Jaffee came from behind to edge Norway's Bernt Evensen in the opening pair. According to David Wallechinsky, most sports historians consider the 1928 10,000 m to be a non-event.\nAfter the Olympics.\nAll five venues used for these games were reused for the Winter Olympics held in St. Moritz twenty years later.\nThe bob run, which opened in 1904, is still in use and has hosted the FIBT World Championships a record 22 times, most recently in 2013.\nThe ski jump was built originally in 1905 and renovated in 1927 for the 1928 Games.

The catcher was a native of Kinston, North Carolina; he was tall, weighed , batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\nEarly career.\nWhite broke into pro ball with the Philadelphia Stars of the Negro American League in . After that season, he was acquired by the St. Louis Browns, whose owner, Bill Veeck, was active in integrating his organization's playing ranks. White spent three seasons in the upper levels of minor league baseball in the Browns' farm system before being traded to the Milwaukee Braves prior to the season.\nMajor League career.\nWhite then spent the entire season and the first two months of on the Braves' National League roster. Playing behind one of the league's workhorse catchers, Del Crandall, White appeared in 50 games in 1954, 16 as starting catcher (while Crandall started 133 of the Braves' 154 games). In his third Major League game, on April 23 against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, White hit his only big-league home run, a solo blow in the top of the 13th inning off Cot Deal. The homer temporarily put the Braves ahead, 5–4, and they would triumph, 7–5, in 14 innings with White handling the catching chores. He also had a three-hit game (in five at bats) against the Cardinals at Busch Stadium on July 5. But he batted only .237 for the season. At the outset of the 1955 campaign, White again backed up Crandall, and in the season's first two months he started nine games at catcher and batted .233.

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. In 1950, the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) selected its first All-American baseball team. It has since chosen All-American teams and a player of the year for each division (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, junior college, and high school). \"Collegiate Baseball\" selects All-American, Freshman All-American, and High School All-American teams. \"Baseball America\" magazine selects pre-season and post-season All-American teams and College Player of the Year honorees.\nVarious organizations selected All-American lists of the best players for the 1994 NCAA Division I college baseball season. The ABCA, the magazine \"Baseball America\", and \"Collegiate Baseball\" were the NCAA-sanctioned selectors. This list only includes players selected to the post-season All-American first team for each selector. However, many All-American selections choose second, third, etc. teams from the remaining eligible candidates.\nAccomplishments.\nThe 1994 College Baseball All-America Team included the most highly regarded college baseball players as recognized by various national selectors and its members accumulated numerous collegiate awards. With Nomar Garciaparra, Jason Varitek, and Danny Graves, the team included three future Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Stars. The following is a summary of the collegiate and MLB accomplishments of the players from the team. However, , R. A. Dickey remains an active MLB player. Five players were selected by all three NCAA-sanctioned selectors: pitcher Danny Graves; catcher Varitek; first baseman Tommy Davis; shortstop Garciaparra; and outfielder Payton. Varitek and Todd Walker had both been selected unanimously to the 1993 College Baseball All-America Team, while Antone Williamson is a repeat All-American according to \"Baseball America\". Veritek had also been a unanimous selection to the 1992 College Baseball All-America Team. José Cruz Jr. would repeat as a selection to the 1995 College Baseball All-America Team by all selectors and Shane Monahan would repeat as a selection by \"Collegiate Baseball\". Walker won the 1993 College World Series Most Outstanding Player. Varitek swept the Dick Howser Trophy, the Rotary Smith Award, and the Golden Spikes Awards in 1994.\nGarciaparra is a two-time American League (AL) batting champion, AL Rookie of the Year, six-time All-Star, who led the AL in at bats, hits, doubles, triples, and intentional walks. He led the AL in errors regardless of position in 2002 and in putouts as a shortstop in 1997. Varitek is a three-time All-Star (2003, 2005 and 2008), Gold Glove-winner, Silver Slugger-winner, and two-time World Series champion (2004 and 2007). He called the pitches for a major league record four no-hitters. Danny Graves, who is a two-time All-Star (2000 and 2004) and won the 2002 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, is the only Vietnamese-born player in MLB history. Georgia Tech had three selections and Clemson had two.\nSeveral other players made notable marks as professional players. Paul Wilson became the MLB number one overall draft pick in 1994. Walker led the NL second basemen in fielding percentage and putouts during the 2002 season. Cruz, who won a Gold Glove in 2003 in the NL, led the NL in putouts as a rightfielder (2003) and the AL in putouts as a centerfielder (2000) but also led the AL in errors committed as a rightfielder (2004). He accumulated over 1,100 hits and 200 home runs. Payton led the AL outfielders in fielding percentage in both 2005 and 2008 with perfect ratings. He led the NL in putouts as a leftfielder in 2003 and in assists as a centerfielder in 2004, but he also led the NL in errors as a centerfielder in 2000.\nKey.\nAll-Americans.\nBelow are the Division I players selected to the various NCAA-sanctioned lists.

Heavyweights were limited to those boxers weighing less than 91 kilograms (200.62 lbs). 17 boxers competed.\nLike all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of four rounds of two minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the white area on the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches by the end of the bout."

The head coach was Sydney Johnson and the team captains were Nick Lake and Marcus Schroeder. The team played its home games in the Jadwin Gymnasium on the University campus in Princeton, New Jersey, and was the runner-up of the Ivy League, which earned them an invitation to the 16-team 2010 College Basketball Invitational single-elimination tournament where they were advanced to the third round to play in the semifinals.\nThe team posted a 22–9 overall record and an 11–3 conference record. On January 6, 2010, against Patrick Saunders had a perfect shooting night from the floor on eight field goals including five three-point shots.

        "text": "The 2010–11 IRB Sevens World Series was the 12th annual IRB Sevens World Series of rugby union sevens tournaments for full national sides run by the International Rugby Board since 1999–2000.\nSevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. However, the most famous event, the Hong Kong Sevens, was played over three days, largely because it involved 24 teams instead of the normal 16.\nItinerary.\nThe IRB announced dates for the 2010–11 events on 1 June 2010, only two days after the final event of the 2009–10 series, the Edinburgh Sevens. The stops remained unchanged from recent years; the only scheduling change for 2010–11 was that the Adelaide event, which moved from its traditional slot of one week after Hong Kong to one week before in 2010, returned to its prior slot for 2011.\nThis was the last season for the South Africa leg in George and the Australia leg in Adelaide. On 13 April 2011, both countries' national unions announced that their respective legs of the series would move to new sites for 2011–12. The South Africa Sevens will move to Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. The Australia leg will move to Skilled Park in the Gold Coast; it was initially known as the \"International Rugby Sevens Gold Coast\", but later rebranded simply as the \"Gold Coast Sevens\".\nCore teams.\nBefore each season, the IRB announces the 12 \"core teams\" that received guaranteed berths in each event in that season's series. The core teams for 2010–11 were:\nThe core teams were unchanged from 2009–10.\nPoints schedule.\nThe season championship was determined by points earned in each tournament. The points allocations for all events were identical to those in the 2009–10 series, reflecting changes that the IRB made starting with that season:\nTournament structure.\nIn all tournaments except Hong Kong, 16 teams participated. Due to its place as the sport's most prestigious annual event, the Hong Kong tournament had 24 teams. In each 16-team tournament, the teams were divided into pools of four teams, who played a round-robin within the pool. Points were awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss. The first tiebreaker was the head-to-head result between the tied teams, followed by difference in points scored during the tournament.\nFour trophies were awarded in each tournament. In descending order of prestige, they were the Cup, whose winner was the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. The Shield was contested in Hong Kong for the first time in 2010. Each trophy was awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\nIn a 16-team tournament, the top two teams in each pool advanced to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers dropped into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl was contested by the third- and fourth-place finishers in each pool, with the losers in the Bowl quarterfinals dropping into the bracket for the Shield.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens adopted a new structure effective with its 2010 edition. As in previous years, the 24 teams were divided into six pools of four teams each, with the competition points system and tiebreakers identical to those for a 16-team event.

The aim of the Euroleague American Tour is to expose to American basketball fans a different basketball approach than the one presented by the NBA, a lot more similar to the NCAA one.\nThe Euroleague teams that participated in that first edition were Partizan Belgrade, Olympiacos and Maccabi Tel Aviv. On the other hand, the NBA franchises that played against them were the Denver Nuggets, the Phoenix Suns, the San Antonio Spurs, the New York Knicks and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The NBA rules that applied to the event combined with the fact that the opponents were all top class NBA teams led to consecutive losses for the Euroleague representants. In Partizan's case, things were even worse as they competed without future All-Euroleague point guard Bo McCalebb and power forward Lawrence Roberts.\nOverall, in spite of the fact that Euroleague teams seemed unable to threaten their NBA competition within the United States, they demonstrated some of the advantages that make them high-class basketball organizations: Solid fundamentals, outstanding team play and some of the best players of FIBA Basketball like Theo Papaloukas, Miloš Teodosić, Aleks Marić, Ioannis Bourousis and Sofoklis Schortsanitis to name a few."

        "text": "Boca Juniors basketball section is part of the Boca Juniors sports club based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The team plays in the Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB), the first division of the Argentine league system. Boca's home games are played at the Estadio Luis Conde, also called the \"Bombonerita\" (in English: \"Small Bombonera\"), as a reference to the club's football stadium known as the \"La Bombonera\".\nAt the local level, the club has 4 First Division championships, among which three editions of the LNB (1996–97, 2003–04 and 2006–07) and 5 national cups, all of them in the Copa Argentina consecutively (top winner of the contest: 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006). It also has 22 titles in the amateur era, the most notable being the 1963 Argentine Club Championship (the highest category of Argentine basketball in the amateur era).\nAt the international level he achieved 3 titles, all of them in the South American Championship of Champion Clubs (2004, 2005 and 2006). Adding national and international tournaments, it is the third most successful club with the most titles in the history of Argentine basketball: 13 official titles behind Peñarol (17) and Atenas (20). At the same time, it is one of the most successful teams in Argentina, since it had great prominence both in the amateur and semi-amateur era of the different metropolitan basketball leagues of the city of Buenos Aires, and in the National Basketball League, where he is one of the greatest champions, which is why he is considered one of the so-called Greats of the National Basketball League.\nGreat players and coaches wore the blue and gold jersey before and/or after representing the National Basketball Team and even playing in the major leagues in Europe and the NBA.\nHistory.\nThe beginning.\nThe basketball section of Boca Juniors was created in 1929, requesting affiliation to the association but it was rejected. In 1930 the club could be registered to Federación Argentina de Básquet (the body that governed basketball in Argentina by then) but only junior teams took part of the competitions. The good results encouraged the club to continue participating in the league. In 1934 the team debuted at second division finishing second.\nIn 1936 a dissident association, the \"Asociación de Básquet de Buenos Aires\" was created. This organized its own championships from 1936 to 1973 when it would later merge with the Federación Argentina again. Boca played the tournaments held by the ABBA becoming one of the most successful teams during the decades of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.\nOn 27 November 1938 Boca Juniors played United States' team Amateur Athletic Union at the Luna Park of Buenos Aires. Boca won the match 38-33 being the first victory achieved by an Argentine basketball team over a North American side. The line-up was José Giuliano, Víctor Di Vita, Pedro Aizcorbe, Carlos Stropiana y Roberto Contini.\nThe \"all-star\" team.\nDuring the decade of the 1940s, Boca played in the Torneo Apertura (organized by the ABA) and then in the Torneo Metropolitano (since 1951) where the best ranked teams from both leagues, ABA and FBA, took part.\nDuring the decade of 1940, Boca was nicknamed \"el equipo de las estrellas\" (\"the all-stars team\" in Spanish). During those years Boca won the 1938 and 1939 Apertura championships and the Campeonato Oficial in 1940 and 1941, all of them organized by the ABBA. The roster was: Pedro Aizcorbe, Daniel Anglés, Elías Bissio, Roberto Contini, Alberto Dayán, Víctor Di Vita, José Giuliano, Carlos Induni, Felipe Mattianich, Mario Mattioni, Pedro Rodríguez and Carlos Stroppiana. Nevertheless, Boca did not got any other championship until middle of the 1950s.\nIn 1951 a new championship, \"Torneo Metropolitano\" was created. This competition joined teams from both rival leagues, Federación Argentina and Asociación de Buenos Aires. To form a more competitive team, Boca hired Rosarian players Enrique Borda and Bernardo Schime, then acquiring Rubén Petrilli. Andrés \"Naranjito\" Rossi was the coach. Despite having lost the first six games, Boca finished in the 4th position in the 1955 tournament. In 1957, with the addition of notable players such as José Olivera, José Novoa and Luis Pérez, Boca won the 1957 and 1959 Metropolitano championships and was runner-up in 1958. The team was also runner-up in 1958 and 1958.\nAfter the tenure of Rossi as coach, Abelardo Dasso replaced him. Under his coaching, Boca Juniors achieved its most significant success, winning during 3 consecutive years (1961, 1962 and 1963) all the tournaments disputed: the Oficial, Apertura and Metropolitano championships. During that period, the squad played a total of 93 games, winning 89.\nBoca Juniors continued with his successful path, winning also the 1964 Apertura and the 1965, 1966 and 1967 Oficial championships.\nBoca won another Metropolitano title in 1969 and the Oficial championship in 1970, defeating Lanús by 91–76 at River Plate arena. The most frequent line-up was Juan Carlos Mazzini, Néstor Delguy, Adalberto Gusso, Emilio Dumani, Juan Tito, Jesús Díaz, with Enrique Borda as coach.\nLiga Nacional titles.\nBoca played the 1984 season, the last before the creation of Liga Nacional de Básquet, although the severe crisis of the club by then caused the team went off the competition few days before the beginning of the tournament. Boca made an effort to play in the second division in 1986 but the association did not allow the team to participate so Boca had to play at the last division, the Regional C. The team promoted to Liga B that same year.\nIn 1988 Boca promoted to Liga A, where the team debuted one year later. Boca Juniors did not make a good campaign so it was relegated to Liga B, where the team promoted again in 1990. At the top level again, in 1996 Boca Juniors inaugurated its first stadium built specifically for the practise of basketball, then named \"Luis Conde\" (mostly known as \"La Bombonerita\") in honour of a recently dead manager of the club. That same year Boca won its first title in the Liga Nacional (defeating Independiente (GP) at the finals. The team roster was: Byron Wilson, Jerome Mincy, Ariel Bernardini, Luis Villar, Sebastián Festa, Gabriel Fernández, Claudio Farabello, Gustavo Fernández, Diego Prego, Claudio Chiappero, Sebastián Acosta, Esteban Acosta, Fernando Oyarzún and Ariel Eslava. Julio Lamas was the coach.\nThat first achievement in the modern era would be succeeded by a second championship in 2003–04 (being its rival at the finals Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP)). The successful era continued, winning its third title in 2006–07 against Peñarol (MdP). Apart from the domestic league, Boca disputed the Copa Argentina de Básquetbol, winning the title in 2002 (inaugural season), 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 (five consecutive times). At international level, Boca won three Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes in 2004, 2005 and 2006 (three consecutive achievements).\nBudget problems.\nIn the 2007–08 season he finished fifth. He was runner-up in the 2007 South American Championship of Champion Clubs, earning 9 points, just like Minas Tênis Clube, but the latter finished with a better point difference. In the 2008–09 season he finished seventh. For the 2009–10 season , Boca Juniors is going through a series of economic difficulties that force the institution to drastically reduce the budget allocated annually to the development of basketball activity in the club. As a result of these inconveniences, the club came very close to losing its place in the National League. However, the board of directors manages to sign an agreement with the airline Aerochaco that allows it to obtain the money necessary to maintain the seat, and to finance the activity of the professional team. In addition, he signed an agreement with the president of the Club Atlético Sarmiento de Resistencia (Chaco), Jorge Capitanich, by which the team would move its home to the basketball stadium of the Chaco institution, in addition to changing the Boca Juniors team name for Aerochaco Boca. They achieved an important fourth place, after being eliminated in the semifinals against Peñarol de Mar del Plata by 3–0, exceeding expectations prior to the start of the tournament. The beginning of the 2010–11 season was marked by strong controversy, since according to some sources, the board of directors had considered selling the team's place in the national league, due to the high economic costs involved in maintaining a team. top-level professional in a discipline that historically had not enjoyed relevant importance, as happened with football.\nBoca had a bad start to the season, quickly falling to the bottom of the competition. The team did not find answers and wandered in the lower part of the table, finally finishing in 17th place, with 13 games won and 17 lost. This forced the team to play a best-of-5 tie to avoid relegation to the second category of the league against the Argentino de Junín, last classified in the regular phase. Finally, Boca won the series 3–0 and, in this way, will maintain its place in the vanguard league of Argentine basketball. In the 2011–12 season he finished eighth. For the 2012–13 season they reached the final stages, losing in the semi-final against Regatas by 3–2. In the 2013–14 season they played again in a semifinal against Peñarol where they were defeated 3–0.\nBad results and fight to maintain the category.\nIn the 2014–15 season it finished in 14th place out of 18. In 2015–16 it finished in 17th place out of 20 teams. In the 2016–17 season they finished tenth (last) in the first phase in the Southern Conference. For the second phase, Boca was reinforced with former NBA Carlos Delfino who had been inactive for 4 years due to a foot injury. Once again they occupied the last place in the Southern Conference, having to compete in a third phase to remain against Echagüe, which finished last in the first and second phases of the Northern Conference. They achieved permanence by beating Echagüe 3–2. For the 2017–18 season it finished in 14th place out of 20. For the 2018–19 season, Boca moved away from the last positions and managed to reach the quarterfinals, losing to San Lorenzo 3–2.\nChange of leadership and return to being the protagonist of the LNB.\nAfter the club's presidential elections in 2019, where Jorge Ameal won, it opted to maintain professional basketball, deciding to invest in the section. He finished in ninth place in the 2019–20 season after its suspension due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. After returning to the fields, with new coach Gonzalo García Boca reached the semifinals of the 2020–21 season where they were defeated by Quimsa 2-0. For the 2021–22 season they would reach the semifinal again and would be defeated again against Quimsa by 3–1. In the 2022–23 season, coach Gonzalo García would present his resignation, after losing against Platense after a bad start (7-8). Carlos Duro would take charge of the team in his third step as coach of the club. He would qualify fifth in the qualifying stage, reversing the bad start and finishing with a record of 25–13. In the reclassification stage they would beat Peñarol 3–0, they would also do the same in the quarterfinals against Oberá. In the semifinals they would face Instituto where they would lose the first two matches. He would manage to tie the series 2–2  , respectively winning both matches in \"La Bombonerita\". The fifth game would be at the Instituto stadium, where after losing by 13 points at halftime, they would win the match 75–72, reaching a new final of the National Basketball League after 16 years. In the final they would be defeated by Quimsa 4-1.\nHome arena.\nLuis Conde Stadium.\nLocated at Arzobispo Espinosa 600, in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca, the Luis Conde Stadium, known as \"La Bombonerita\", was inaugurated on 29 June 1996 and has a capacity of 2,400 spectators. On that date, its baptism took place with a friendly confrontation between the local team and Obras Sanitarias, which ended 85–74 for the homeowner. \nIn June 2022, a series of renovations were announced that were estimated to be completed by October of that same year, but were finally completed in January 2023. The renovation of the stadium, according to the head of the club basketball, was inspired by the Roberto Pando Sports Center, and consisted of replacing the game field, with FIBA certification; a 5700K LED projector lighting system; a reconditioning of changing rooms, offices, entrances and exterior, in addition to the installation of central air conditioning. The stadium was re-inaugurated on January 16 with the match between Boca and the Ciclista Olímpico Club for the 2022–23 National Basketball League, which culminated in Boca's victory by 84–76.\nSeason by season.\n Champions   Runners-up   Promoted   Relegated  "

Butch van Breda Kolff served as head coach and the team captain was Art Hyland. The team played its home games in the Dillon Gymnasium in Princeton, New Jersey. The team was the champion of the Ivy League, earning an invitation to the 25-team 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nThe team posted a 19–6 overall record and a 12–3 conference record. After ending the regular season tied for the conference lead, the team won a one-game playoff against on March 8, 1963, at the Rose Hill Arena at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, by a 65–53 margin for the Ivy League championship and the automatic invitation to the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The team lost its NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament East region first round contest against the by an 82–81 margin at The Palestra on March 11, 1963. Bradley set the current NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament record for free throws made in 100% effort (16) against St. Joseph's. That continues to be the second best perfect free throw shooting night in Ivy League history. Although the Princeton record book credits Bradley with a 21 for 21 night on January 19, 1963, against , the Ivy League record book only recognizes one performance better than Bradley's 16 free throw effort (John Lee's 21 on December 27, 1957).\nBill Bradley, who for the first of three consecutive seasons led the conference in scoring with a 27.5 points per game average in conference games, and Art Hyland were both first team All-Ivy League selections. In addition, Bradley was a 1963 NCAA Men's Basketball All-American selection by numerous panels: First team (\"Sporting News\", Helms Foundation), Second team (Associated Press, United Press International, \"Look\", Converse, NEA), Third team (National Association of Basketball Coaches). Bradley would become the school's only three-time All-American two years later. Bradley also led the conference in rebounding with a 13.6 average, while Hyland led the conference in field goal percentage with a 48.2%."

        "text": "William E. Green (December 8, 1940 – March 15, 1994) was an American basketball player. He was a college basketball standout for Colorado State University (CSU) between 1960–61 and 1962–63. A , 230 lb center, Green was CSU's first-ever NCAA All-American when he was named to the consensus second team in 1963. He led the Rams in both scoring and rebounding for all three seasons and remains etched in the school's record book for both categories. He scored 1,682 points and grabbed 726 rebounds which remain second- and fifth-all time, respectively, through the 2009–10 season. Six of the top 13 single game scoring records belong to Green including the top two: 48 points versus Denver and 44 against Regis. Every season that Green suited up for CSU they qualified for a postseason tournament. In his sophomore and junior years, the Rams earned berths into the National Invitation Tournament. They reached the quarterfinals and first round, respectively. During his senior year, the Rams lost in the first round of the 1963 NCAA Tournament to Oklahoma City, 70–67. For his three-year career, Green averaged 22.1 points and 9.6 rebounds per game.\nFear of flying.\nAfter Green's collegiate career ended and he graduated from CSU in the spring of 1963, the Boston Celtics selected him in the first round (8th overall) of the 1963 NBA draft. It was a foregone conclusion that he would play a professional sport, as Green was also drafted by the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) that year. Green ultimately never played any sport professionally due to an ever-increasing fear of flying. The fear had emerged gradually throughout his college career, and after a rough flight back to CSU from Utah during his senior year he realized how terrified he really was of flying.\nThe Celtics had tried to convince Green to work through his fear during the 1963–64 preseason. Professional help did not work, and Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach allowed him to take a bus out to St. Louis, Missouri for a preseason game on the condition that Green flew back. When it came time to go home, he could not step on the plane. Green later said, \"The fear just built to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I made up my mind: I wouldn't do it. Auerbach told me to go work on it [the fear] and come back later.\" Green quit the Celtics right before the regular season began and never returned to attempt professional basketball (or any other professional sport), knowing that in order to play he would have to get over his fear of flying, which was something he could not do.\nLater life.\nRealizing that any future as a professional athlete was out of the question, Green earned a master's degree from Brooklyn College. He taught in several New York City public schools afterward, and then in 1971 became the principal of Jordan L. Mott School in the South Bronx. The school, an extremely dangerous and under-performing one, greatly turned around with Green's direction. He enacted stringent rules that made students earn certain grades and reach specified numbers of \"class points\" to be able to even \"attend\" the school's basketball games, let alone play in them. Green also created an atmosphere of intellectual competition whereby different classes within each grade would compete against one another—literally sitting desk-to-desk—and earn points for their class based on the outcomes. He would then post the school's weekly updated class and grade rankings in the hallways, which the students would intently follow. His methods, although unconventional, worked, and even though Jordan L. Mott School was pulling its students from two of the poorest performing elementary schools in New York City, most students were in the top 11% of all city public schools in terms of their reading level by the time they left Mott (after 8th grade). He had earned myriad awards honoring his school's success.\nGreen died on March 15, 1994, at age 53."

        "text": "The National Field Archery Society (NFAS) is a British organisation that exists to foster and promote field archery as a sport.\nInformation in this article is taken from items in newsletters of the NFAS.\nHistory.\nField archery was introduced to the United Kingdom by US armed forces personnel stationed in the UK during World War II and the subsequent Cold War period.\nArchers wanting to practice field archery formed clubs such as the Severn Valley Field Archers and the Dunkery Field Bowmen.\nIn 1959 the British Field Archery Association (BFAA) was formed at Dunster in Somerset. The association held annual championships, and defined various rounds shot at unmarked distances in woodland. The BFAA did not require clear lanes between the shooting position and the target - the preference was for the course to be as natural as possible.\nIn 1970 the BFAA merged with the more recently formed English Field Archery Association (EFAA). The EFAA drew its membership largely from areas around US military bases in the UK, and followed the US practice of shooting at marked distances through cleared lanes.\nThe merged organisation followed the EFAA's preferences for marked distances and cleared lanes.\nMany archers who had been members of the BFAA were dissatisfied with the changes to the character of field archery. In 1972 a group of archers drafted a constitution and a set of rules that enshrined their preferred style of shooting unmarked distances in natural conditions. This led to the formation of the National Field Archery Society, whose first Annual General Meeting took place on 10 March 1973 at Clayton Community Centre, Norwood Lane, Clayton, Newcastle, Staffordshire.\nCurrent status.\nThe NFAS has grown to become the largest field archery organisation in the UK. The NFAS is not affiliated to any international organisation.\nThe NFAS recognises 12 styles of bow:\nThe general rules are determined by a committee and ratified or rejected by the membership. Specific rules applying to each bow style are determined by votes cast only by archers who shoot that bow style.\nRounds are shot at unmarked distances, predominantly using 2D and 3D animal targets.\nTwo championship events are held every year:"

It began at 7:00 PM (IST) on 3 October 2010 ending at 10:00 PM (IST) displaying India's varied culture in a plethora of cultural showcases. Wizcraft was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\nGuests of Honour.\nThe following were the guests that attended the opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games:\nThe Royal Family.\nThe Prince of Wales (now Charles III, representing Elizabeth II as Head of the Commonwealth), Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex attended the ceremony.\nInternational Guests.\nA total of three heads of state from outside India attended the opening ceremony; two from Commonwealth nations and one from a non-Commonwealth nation. The three head of states are Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, Marcus Stephen, President of Nauru and a multiple Commonwealth gold medallist, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco, a former Olympian, whose country Monaco is not a member of the Commonwealth. Sir Anand Satyanand, the Governor General of New Zealand (the first of Indian descent), attended the ceremony as well.\nAlongside the Commonwealth president, attendees included International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge. He was quoted as saying, \"I think India has set a good foundation stone for the Olympics bid and a successful Commonwealth Games can help India mount a serious bid for the Olympics.\"\nProgramme.\nThe opening ceremony featured aspects of India's heritage and culture in seven segments. It featured an aerostat costing U$8 million, measuring 40×80x12 meters and manufactured in Oswestry, England. The original plan was to have drummers on the aerostat, but the plan was cancelled. The ceremony started with the Indian national anthem which was played live at the stadium. The roof of the stadium turned into orange colour and the ground was lit up with three colours of the Indian flag – orange in the center, white in the middle and green near the boundary.\nRhythm of India.\nThe countdown for the opening of commonwealth games started as the drums were being played, and fireworks exploded from the roof of the stadium. The aerostat slowly raised from the ground to the center space of the roof while a traditional Rajasthani hymn was being played by the musicians. Various Drummers from Assam, Kerala, Manipur, Karnataka, Odisha, Punjab and Meghalaya played a symphony that aimed to be \"uniquely Indian in character, yet global in appeal\". Seven year old tabla player Keshav from Puducherry played the tabla instrument in front of the audience live and he was given a big applause from the audience.\nSwagatam.\nHariharan led this segment, which created an amalgamation of Hindustani classical, Carnatic and folk music. The song was composed by A. R. Rahman, who also composed the official theme song of the games, and was performed by various artists along with Hariharan. Children from various Delhi schools participated in a simultaneous performance forming hands of an Indian woman in a pose of Namaste – a popular Indian salutation. Later, they separated and rearranged themselves in another formation representing the Indian flag colors of saffron, white and green while another group of children entered the stadium and covered the flag formations with a large white cloth. In a widely appreciated act, the children then made a mehndi – a traditional Indian art – on this large white piece of cloth in under 30 seconds on the spot.Latest News Updates\nTree of Knowledge.\nPt. Birju Maharaj (Kathak), Guru Rajkumar Singhajit Singh-Charu Sija Mathur (Manipuri), Dr. Saroja Vaidyanathan (Bharatnatyam), Dr. Sonal Mansingh (Odissi), Bharati Shivaji (Mohiniattam) and Raja Reddy-Radha Reddy (Kuchipudi) choreographed 480 dancers bringing alive India's \"Guru-Shishya Parampara\" or the master-protege tradition on stage through classical dance recitals which also depicted four different seasons of India. The aerostat (the largest ever helium balloon built for such an event) formed the leaves of the Bodhi tree, while large strips elevated from the ground, made of silk and bamboo fibre form the tree trunk. After the display of classical dance, the dancers displayed yoga moves.\nThe Great Indian Journey.\nThis segment will give a glimpse of the lives of the masses in India, as seen through a train window. Art director Omung Kumar created a 600-ft train of bamboo sticks for this. It portrayed a common man's life and every thing in it, such as the bangle shops, politicians campaigning, Bollywood, the cycle shop etc.\nFinale.\nAcademy and Grammy award winner A. R. Rahman ended the programme with his rendition of \"Jiyo Utho Badho Jeeto\", the theme song of the Delhi games, and \"Jai Ho\".\nList of national flag bearers.\nAustralia entered first as the host of the last games, and India entered last as the host. Excluding these two nations, the flag bearers entered by alphabetical order of their nations; Anguilla was the first (after Australia) and Zambia was the last (before India). Each flag bearer was preceded by a woman in traditional Indian dress, each reflecting a different part of the country, carrying a placard with the country's name.\nSpectators' response.\nIn the opening ceremony the head of organizing committee faced embarrassment, when he was booed by the spectators at the start of his welcome speech to 60,000 spectators in the opening ceremony. The atmosphere otherwise for the teams and officials was fine, especially when they offered warm applause to the neighbouring Pakistan squad, with whom it has tense relationships. Sri Lanka also got a loud applause. The head finished his speech in five minutes and then handed over to Michael Fennell, the Chief of the Commonwealth Games Federation.\nBaton Procession.\nBoxer Vijender Singh carried the Queen's Baton into the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, at the Opening Ceremony. The baton was then passed to boxer Mary Kom, 5-time world champion. It was then passed to Samresh Jung, who was named best competitor of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia . It was then passed to Sushil Kumar, world champion wrestler, who finally handed the Queen's Baton to the Prince of Wales (now Charles III)."

        "text": "Two human polls make up the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls.\nAP poll.\nThe Associated Press (AP) preseason poll was released on October 28, 2010. This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as \"March Madness\".\nESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. Any team receiving votes after the top 25 are listed after the top 25 by their point totals. However, these are not real rankings: They are not considered #26, #27, etc. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775. The preseason poll was released on October 21, 2010.\nPreseason polls.\nVarious publications and news sources release their preseason top 25 months before the season commences."

        "text": "Skeleton Cave is a lava tube within Deschutes County, Oregon, of the United States. The cave is within Deschutes National Forest and is located on the northern flank of Newberry Volcano near the city of Bend. The cave is between 75,000 and 400,000 years old.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe cave was first documented by American settlers circa 1924, although a stick was found inside the cave with pencilled markings showing visitation from 1894. Perhaps on that same visit, an illegal moonshiner's still was found inside the cave. At one time the lava tube may have been referred to as Bone Cave but it received its current moniker as Skeleton Cave from Phil Brogan who observed many assorted pieces of skeletons within. One theory put forth by Dr. James W. Gidley, a scientist from the National Museum, claimed all the fossils fell into the cave from cracks in the ceiling created by earthquakes. Gidley believed this because he couldn't fathom why an animal would crawl all the way into the cave to die. The skylight entrance to the cave served as a natural trap in which animals could not escape. Several newspaper accounts note fossils within. The most noteworthy remnants belonged to a horse from the Pleistocene that was later identified as \"Equus niobrarensis\". A bear at least \"one third larger than any living species\" was also found in the cave. Many other pieces of bone were found inside the cave. \nA list of the known skeletal remains include:\nHistory.\nThe cave was surveyed by Walter J. Perry and Phil Brogan using a compass and pace method. They measured a length of 3,036 feet. Perry then later sketched the outline of the cave passage. He noted a side passage at about 1,734 feet into the cave, which was later named the Bear Passage. This same passage is where the majority of the skeletons and bone dust were found. Perry would later be filmed in the cave by MGM and FOX News for a history film about the area.\nIn a book published by Ronald Greeley of NASA, the cave was surveyed and his map produced a length of 3,300 feet. But it did not include the small portion south of the entrance. In 1971, a complete survey by Jim Nieland discerned a more accurate length of 3,560 feet. Boyd Cave is a part of the same lava flow as Skeleton Cave and trends toward the Bear Passage, also known as the Tributary Tube.\nIn recent times, the cave, along with others nearby, was evaluated and an environmental impact assessment done. Skeleton Cave in particular had its parking lot relocated to minimize impact to the vegetation and cave resources. A seasonal closure was placed from October 15 to May 1 of every year for bat hibernation. The cave was historically known to be a bat cave (harboring bats) and was possibly mapped by the Bend Commercial club.\nToday, Wanderlust Tours \nis the only company permitted to lead tours through Boyd Cave."

It was the first time that India hosted the Commonwealth Games and the second time it was held in Asia after Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. A total of 6,081 athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) participated in this Games, competing in 272 events in 21 sports.\nAthletes from 36 participating CGAs won at least one medal; athletes from 23 of these CGAs secured at least one gold. Australia led the medal table for the sixth consecutive time with 74 golds and 177 medals overall. Host nation India finished second in the table for the first time in Commonwealth Games history with a tally of 38 golds and 101 medals overall. Botswana, the Cayman Islands and Samoa won their first ever Commonwealth Games gold medals. Australian swimmer Alicia Coutts emerged as the most successful athlete with five gold medals.\nMedal table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by an NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nIn Boxing two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class. Additionally there was a tie of three athletes for the third place in the women's pole vault in athletics meant that three bronze medals were awarded. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. \n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nWrestling.\nMen's Greco-Roman – 96 kg.\nSilver medallist Hassene Fkiri of Australia was disqualified from the entire competition for making an obscene gesture at the judges.\nKakoma Bella-Lufu of South Africa was elevated from bronze to silver. Eric Feunekes of Canada was elevated from 4th to the bronze medal position.\nAthletics.\nWomen's 100 metres.\nSally Pearson, an Australian hurdles specialist, was the initial winner of the gold medal in the women's 100 metres contest. However, the English Commonwealth Association launched an appeal arguing that Pearson had also false started at the same time that Laura Turner was disqualified for doing so. A final decision could not be made before the final as the chief start judge had left the stadium and the starter has no authority to disqualify an athlete. Pearson was disqualified later that night but a delay in communication meant Pearson was only told of the decision against her immediately prior to the medal ceremony. Nigeria's Oludamola Osayomi was promoted to the gold medal, while Natasha Mayers of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and English athlete Katherine Endacott were elevated to the silver and bronze positions, respectively. On 11 October Oludamola Osayomi was reported to have tested positive for the banned stimulant Methylhexaneamine. She was disqualified from the gold medal position on 12 October and as a result Natasha Mayers and Katherine Endacott was promoted to the gold and silver positions respectively while Bertille Delphine Atangana of Cameroon was promoted to the bronze position.\nWomen's 400 metres.\nOn 15 October it was announced that silver medallist Folashade Abugan had been disqualified after testing positive for testosterone prohormone. Aliann Pompey of Guyana was promoted to the silver medal position, with the bronze medal going to Christine Amertil of the Bahamas.\nWomen's 4 x 400 metres.\nFollowing the positive doping test recorded by Folashade Abugan Nigeria were disqualified from second place. England were promoted to the silver medal position, with the bronze medal going to Canada.\nBoxing.\nBantamweight.\nOn 8 May 2011 Sri Lanka's Manju Wanniarachchi was provisionally disqualified by the Commonwealth Games Federation after testing positive for Norandrosterone during the Games. He had 21 days to appeal the decision but on 26 May announced that he did not wish to file an appeal and retired from the sport. On 6 June 2011 the Commonwealth Games Federation announced Sean McGoldrick of Wales as the new gold medallist. Tirafalo Seoko of Botswana was upgraded from bronze to silver on the basis that he had lost to Wanniarachchi in the semi-finals.

Beach Volleyball Charity Tournament is a philanthropic volleyball tournament that aims at earning money and gaining awareness on behalf of various charitable organizations. The first tournament took place in the summer of 1989, in Ottawa Ontario at Britania Beach and moved to Mooney's Bay Beach a few years later and continues at Money's Bay Beach today. The tournament is completely nonprofit and is put together by unpaid volunteers. The program normally reaches out to smaller, local charitable organizations. The tournament is held in Canada, on Toronto Island and in Ottawa, Ontario. The acronym H.O.P.E. stands for \"Helping Other People Everywhere\". The tournaments take place annually during the summer months.\nGeneral history.\nSince the first tournament in 1989, HOPE has raised more than $650,000 for local charities. Annually the tournament treats to up to six thousand people. The ages range from 18-to mid-40s. To apply for the tournament you must be at least eighteen years old. Teams must have six to ten players. Everyone is guaranteed to play six games, and must pay a three hundred dollar entrance fee. There are six divisions; Beginner, Recreational, Intermediate, Competitive, Corporate Challenge, and New Individuals. Different rules may apply for different divisions. All divisions are separated my amount of experience. The tournament is the largest in southern Ontario and it caters to 400-500 teams annually. The tournament brings people from all parts of Canada and the United States. The event also gets extensive media coverage which has helped it grow and spread its cause extensively throughout its history. Since it is a non-profit organization the charity receives most of its resources and funds solely through donations.\nLocation.\nThe tournament is located on Toronto Island, Ontario, Canada. To arrive on the island players and family members must take the Queens Quay Ferry and pay a small fee. The island is relatively small and has been chosen for its short distance from Toronto and its view of the city. The island provides a small eatery and a beer garden for the players and their families. These facilities are in no way connected with the charity. The tournament brings people from all parts of Canada and the United States.\nHOPE chose volleyball as its charity because it is the number one amateur sport in Canada. Statistics show that over 800,000 Canadians play volleyball regularly. Volleyball is a very inexpensive sport to play which makes it much easier for every class to become involved in.\nDonations and fundraising.\nTo enter the tournament all teams must pay around three hundred dollars. Individual players are required a smaller fee. Individuals may also pledge to donate a set amount annually. All funds that are collected go straight towards the two chosen charities and are in no way used for profit. The tournament raises all of its funds through fees and donations. To emphasize donations the organization has created an incentive program that delivers prizes to the highest donating individuals. A large number of charities have received money from the tournament over its history.\nH.O.P.E Volleyball.\nIn junction to the HOPE tournament, the annual summer fest has become a part of the annual HOPE tradition. The fest provides various activities for the players and their families free of cost. The event has live entertainment, vendors, and food.

        "text": "The Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball team represents Santa Clara University in NCAA Division I basketball competition. The team plays home games at the Leavey Center in Santa Clara, California and have been members of the West Coast Conference since its formation in 1952. The team is currently coached by Herb Sendek, who had previously been the head coach at NC State and Arizona State. Sendek was hired on March 29, 2016.\nSanta Clara has a long history of basketball success, having appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments and 6 National Invitational Tournaments and producing a number of both collegiate All-Americans and NBA players. The 2010–11 team won the 2011 CollegeInsider.com Tournament, and the 2012–13 team won the 2013 College Basketball Invitational. They are the only team to have won a CBI and a CIT.\nMore recently, the Broncos have returned to the NIT in both 2022 and 2023, and in each season produced a first round draft pick in the NBA draft.\nHistory.\nBasketball made its inauspicious debut at Santa Clara in 1904 with a 9–7 victory over Alameda High School. Later that year, Santa Clara played its first intercollegiate game, a loss to the University of the Pacific, then located just down the road from Santa Clara. Early schedules composed of high school and YMCA opponents gave way to wholly intercollegiate schedules, and by 1916, the Broncos were matching up with teams like Stanford, USC, and Nevada, in addition to traditional arch-rivals San Francisco and St. Mary's. Santa Clara has long had a series of long-tenured coaches; since 1935, only seven different men have coached the Broncos.\nThe first long-tenured coach of Santa Clara was Harlan Dykes, who led the team to a 101–48 record. Much like the university football team, the Broncos played many home games in San Francisco, both at Kezar Pavilion and at the Civic Center.\nMore sustained success for Santa Clara came under Head Coach George Barsi, whose tenure spanned from 1935 to 1945. Barsi was a graduate of Santa Clara in 1930. Barsi's \"Magicians of the Maplewood\" included future Warriors Head Coach Bob Feerick as well as Santa Clara's first All-American, Ralph \"Toddy\" Giannini. The Broncos dazzled crowds in excess of 20,000 at Madison Square Garden and defeated City College of New York and La Salle University by 20 points apiece during an exhibition match-up. Santa Clara was among the first teams to shoot one-handed or run the fast break.\nSome of Santa Clara's earliest basketball stars, like Bruce Hale, Dick O'Keefe, and Stan Patrick, played in the NBL, the forerunner to the modern NBA.\nFollowing the post-war period, former Santa Clara star Bob Feerick returned to coach the Broncos. Under his guidance, the Broncos advanced to the 1952 Final Four, as well as Elite Eight trips in 1953 and 1954. Santa Clara forward Ken Sears appeared on the cover of the new \"Sports Illustrated\" in December 1954, becoming the first basketball player, college or pro, to do so. After leading the Broncos back to the NCAA tournament in 1960, Feerick left Santa Clara in 1962 to coach the NBA's San Francisco Warriors, who had just relocated from Philadelphia.\nReplacing Feerick was Dick Garibaldi, a member of the 1952 Final Four team, who led the Broncos for eight seasons and compiled an overall record of . His 1968 squad finished at 27–2, dropping only one regular season game, to local rival San Jose State. Led on the court by Bud Ogden and Dennis Awtrey, Santa Clara reached as high as second in the AP poll. The Broncos also appeared in the NCAA tournament in 1967 and 1969. In a three-year period, they compiled a record.\nGaribaldi resigned in the summer of 1970 to work for Converse shoes, and Carroll Williams became the longest tenured coach in Santa Clara's basketball history, leading the Broncos from 1970 to 1991. He led the team to a record. Despite the sustained success, Williams took the Broncos to an NCAA tournament only once (1987); in addition, the team reached the NIT in 1984, 1985, and 1989. Williams' tenure produced two of Santa Clara's most memorable players, Kurt Rambis and Nick Vanos, the former remembered for his time with the Lakers and the latter remembered for his untimely death shortly after entering the NBA. Both players would have their numbers retired.\nDick Davey became the head coach in 1992, after serving as an assistant for many years. He experienced immediate success, thanks to a young Canadian point guard, Steve Nash, who led the Broncos to three NCAA tournaments in 1993, 1995, and 1996. In 1993, the fifteenth-seeded Broncos upset second-seeded (and #5) Arizona, becoming the second team to do so. Nash went on to become Santa Clara's most decorated player at the professional level, twice winning the NBA MVP award.\nFollowing the 2006 season, Davey retired under controversial circumstances, as it appeared some boosters had pushed hard for his retirement. Davey compiled overall record, and a record in West Coast Conference play. He won three straight regular season WCC titles and one WCC tournament.\nHe was replaced by Kerry Keating, an assistant coach from UCLA. In nine seasons at the helm of the Broncos, Keating led the Broncos to both CBI and CIT championships, but was unable to take the Broncos to the NCAA tournament or finish better than 4th in the WCC. Keating's overall record as head coach was , with a record in WCC play. Keating is the only coach to post a lifetime losing record in conference play with Santa Clara. On March 7, 2016, Keating was fired by Santa Clara.\nThree weeks later, Santa Clara announced the hiring of Herb Sendek, whose head coaching experience included time at Miami University, North Carolina State, and Arizona State. Sendek's resume includes trips to the NIT or NCAA tournament in 18 of his 22 seasons as a head coach. In 2022, Santa Clara returned to the NIT for the first time since the 1980s, and saw Jalen Williams drafted 12th overall, the first Bronco selected in the NBA draft since Steve Nash. The following year, Brandin Podziemski was drafted 19th overall by the Golden State Warriors.\nRivalries.\nSanta Clara maintains a number of rivalries, most of which are almost a century old. Santa Clara's most heated rivals have traditionally been the other Bay Area WCC members, San Francisco and Saint Mary's. All WCC members are treated like rivals, as are all four in-state members of the Pac-12.\nSan Francisco Dons.\nSanta Clara and San Francisco first met in 1908, and have met 211 times since. Santa Clara has leads the series, 111–101. As two comparably sized Jesuit institutions within an hours drive of each other, the Broncos and Dons are natural rivals. The rivalry was heightened in the 1950s, with Santa Clara advancing to the Final Four in 1952, and San Francisco winning the tournament in 1954 and 1955. In a time when the NCAA tournament field was limited to 16 teams, the winner of the rivalry series was often the WCAC representative. The rivalry has remained competitive to the present day, however, it has lost some of its luster following San Francisco's self-imposed death penalty in 1981. Up to that point, the Dons had been one of college basketball's powerhouses, and the Broncos had played the role of foil. Santa Clara has won a majority of the match-up since the San Francisco program was revived in 1985.\nSan Jose State Spartans.\nSan Jose State and Santa Clara first played in 1909, and Santa Clara leads the all-time series, 82–32. The rivalry between the two schools was formalized in 2002 as the Rivalry Series which compiled point totals in men's and women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's golf, men's and women's cross-country, baseball, softball, and women's volleyball, tennis and water polo.\nSaint Mary’s Gaels.\nSaint Mary's and Santa Clara first played in 1910, and Santa Clara leads the all-time series, 131–83. The rivalry between the two schools has been most intense in football, and was less competitive in basketball. However, with both schools dropping football and Saint Mary's recent rise to prominence in basketball have heightened the rivalry.\nPacific Tigers.\nSanta Clara and Pacific own the oldest intercollegiate basketball rivalry in California, with the series beginning in 1904. Santa Clara leads the all-time series 89–51. The rivalry was initially one of proximity, as Pacific was founded in Santa Clara and later moved to San Jose. When the basketball rivalry began, the schools were located a stone's throw from one another. When Pacific relocated to Stockton in 1923, the rival lessened somewhat. Pacific was a founding member, along with Santa Clara, of the WCAC conference in 1952. However, the rivalry took another hit when Pacific moved to the 1971 to join the Big West Conference. However, the teams remained fixtures on one another's schedules. With Pacific returning to the WCC in 2013, the rivalry will take-on renewed significance.\nStanford Cardinal.\nStanford and Santa Clara first met in 1912, and Stanford leads the all-time series 51–25. Both universities are in Santa Clara County, and have long shared a rivalry on and off the court. The two teams have not met on the court since 2008. Former Bronco head coach Dick Davy served as an assistant at Stanford from 2008 to 2012 following his retirement as head coach of Santa Clara in 2007. Santa Clara's Kevin Foster passed Stanford's Todd Lichti as the leading scorer in Bay Area college basketball history. The series is set to resume in 2019.\nGonzaga Bulldogs.\nA newer rivalry for the Broncos has been with the Gonzaga Bulldogs. The teams first met in 1946, but did not become regular competitors until Gonzaga joined the West Coast Conference in 1979. Gonzaga leads the all-time series 49–31. In 2007, Santa Clara became the first, and to date, one of only two WCC members to beat Gonzaga in the McCarthey Athletic Center. In 2012, the attendance at the Santa Clara-Gonzaga game was 4,907, a Leavey Center record.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 11–13.\nThe Broncos win over Arizona in 1993 was the second time in tournament history that a 15 seed has upset a 2 seed.\nNIT results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in six National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 2–6.\nCBI results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational. Their record is 5–1 and were the 2013 champions.\nCIT results.\nThe Broncos have appeared in one CollegeInsider.com Tournament. Their record is 5–0 and were the 2011 champions.\nFacilities.\nSan Francisco Years.\nThe earliest Santa Clara Bronco home games were played at the San Jose YMCA, located down the Alameda from the campus. By 1927, however, the Broncos had adopted Kezar Pavilion, about 50 miles north of campus in San Francisco, as their home arena. In 1932, the Broncos began splitting time between the San Francisco Civic Center and Kezar. Though it may seem strange in a modern context to play games so far from campus, before the post-war boom, the vast majority of the Bay Area's population lived in San Francisco, and with them, the majority of Santa Clara's alumni and fans. Santa Clara's campus was considered rural and isolated at the time. With the Construction of the Seifert Gymnasium on campus in 1935, some less marquee match-ups were scheduled to be played on campus, much to the delight of the student body. \nSan Jose Civic Auditorium.\nWith its construction in 1935, San Jose finally had a building worthy of hosting intercollegiate basketball. Though the Broncos would still play 'home' games in San Francisco intermittently until 1951, San Jose Civic became Santa Clara's true home. The San Jose Civic Auditorium was designed for stage productions, giving the building a unique feeling during basketball games. Those sitting on the ground floor had an intimate view of the game, and opposing students were often state on opposite sides of the balconies. During the Second World War, due to wartime travel restrictions, most home games were played at the smaller, on-campus, Seifert Gymnasium.\nToso Pavilion.\nFollowing Santa Clara's successful run in the late 1960s, boosters and fans clamored to move the team to a modern, spacious, on-campus home. The Civic Auditorium was small for major college basketball tenant, and scheduling was made difficult by sharing the space with both concerts and productions, as well as the rival San Jose State Spartants basketball team, who also called the venue home. With funds raised, Santa Clara began construction on Toso Pavilion in 1974. Once it was completed in 1975, the Broncos moved, for the first time, to an on-campus home with modern amenities. The facility featured an air supported vinyl fabric roof supported by 11 large fans constantly producing a higher air pressure inside the dome than outside, similar to the Pontiac Silverdome or BC Place Stadium. The inside of the facility featured the main activity floor, two recreation areas, and team locker rooms. The building was named for Hal Toso, a basketball player at Santa Clara in the 1920s, and a major donor, supporter, and member of the Santa Clara Athletic Hall of Fame.\nLeavey Center.\nThe roof of Toso Pavilion developed several tears, and by 2000, the decision was made to renovate the building. A more permanent roof structure was built, and the interior of the building was renovated and brought to modern standards at a cost of $14 million. The newly christened Leavey Center was named for Thomas Leavey, a 1922 Santa Clara Alumnus who founded Farmers Insurance. The Leavey Center contains the whole of the Athletic Department, and locker rooms for all team, excluding baseball, are in the building. The Capacity was reduced from 5,000 seats to a listed capacity of 4,500 with the renovation, due to the addition of chairback seats. However, larger crowds have been known to watch the Broncos play, with 4,907 on hand to watch the Santa Clara-Gonzaga game in 2012. The Leavey Center has also played host to nine West Coast Conference Basketball championships, most recently in 2005.\nOther off campus venues.\nSanta Clara has been known to host games against some opponents at off-campus sites to accommodate larger crowds. In 2004, Santa Clara upset No. 3 North Carolina 77–66 at Oracle Arena. Santa Clara has also hosted Kansas, San Jose State, and others at the SAP Center, which is located on Santa Clara Street in downtown San Jose, only a few miles from campus."

        "title": "Professional ice hockey in Connecticut",
        "text": "Professional ice hockey in Connecticut has a rich tradition dating from the mid-1920s. Most of these teams were NHL minor league affiliates located in New Haven, though with the closure of the New Haven Coliseum, minor league affiliates now exist only exist in Hartford and Bridgeport. Hartford had its own Major league team, the Whalers team that existed in Hartford from 1974-97. Independent hockey leagues teams have also been gaining a foothold in Danbury starting in 2004.\nThis article concludes with a summary of all past and present hockey teams from Connecticut, listed by city and league for reference, and to provide links to main articles about each team.\nHistory.\nNew Haven/Bridgeport.\nWhile New Haven has no currently active teams, New Haven has long been considered the birthplace of hockey in Connecticut. Teams have been hosted since the mid-1920s, first at the New Haven Arena until 1972 (demolished 1975), and followed by the New Haven Coliseum until 2002 (demolished in 2007). The New Haven Haven Blades (1954–72) and later the New Haven Nighthawks (1972–93) were the most popular franchises. Since the Coliseum's closure in 2002, professional hockey has not returned to New Haven. The American Hockey League Sound Tigers have played in nearby Bridgeport since 2001.\nIn 1992, the Nighthawks signed a last-minute player-development affiliation with the Ottawa Senators, which required the team to be re-branded as the New Haven Senators for the 1992–93 season. Fans were ambivalent to the name change and attendance plummeted, making this the franchise last season in New Haven.\nHockey had a brief reboot with the arrival of former Hartford Whalers' affiliate, the Beast of New Haven (formerly the Carolina Monarchs), which were displaced from North Carolina by their parent team's relocation in 1997. They were followed by a two seasons of the independent New Haven Knights from 2000–02. Following the Knights' departure, however, chronic maintenance issues in the New Haven Coliseum, as well as competition from other southern Connecticut arenas, prompted state and city officials to permanently close the arena in 2002. Demolition of the Coliseum was completed in throughout 2006, concluded by the implosion of the signature elevated parking garage on January 20, 2007.\nThe Bridgeport Sound Tigers begin play in the AHL in 2001, in the newly constructed Arena at Harbor Yard. During the first season of play, the Sound Tigers won their division championship and played in the Calder Cup Finals, though ultimately losing to the Chicago Wolves four games to one. As of the 2009 season, the team had seven winning seasons. Located 20 miles west of the New Haven Coliseum, competition from the Arena at Harbor Yard was one of the factors in the coliseum's demise. In 2021, the team was rebranded the Bridgeport Islanders after their long time NHL affiliate the New York Islanders.\nHartford.\nHartford, the capital of Connecticut, was bereft of a professional ice hockey team until 1974, when the Whalers franchise from the World Hockey Association came to town, occupying the newly built Hartford Civic Center. After the Whalers relocated to North Carolina in 1997, the minor league team the Hartford Wolf Pack relocated to the Civic Center. In the years since, various proposals for a new arena have been submitted with the hope of attracting a new major league hockey team.\nMajor league.\nThe former Hartford Whalers were the first and only major league hockey team located in Connecticut, nestled halfway between the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers/Islanders hockey markets. The team was founded in Boston as the New England Whalers, one of the original World Hockey Association teams (from whose initials \"WHA\" inspired the Whaler's name). The WHA planned for a rival team to play in New York on Long Island, however the NHL created the Islanders franchise to fill the desired arena, shutting them out of the market.\nThe Whalers moved to Hartford in 1974, and entered the NHL in 1979, where it became the Hartford Whalers. Although it had losing seasons its first two years in Hartford, the team had won the 1972–73 WHA championship while in Boston and, never missed the playoffs while in the WHA. The team had mixed success in the NHL before relocating to Raleigh, North Carolina in 1997 due to attendance and revenue issues.\nPost NHL.\nYears after the departure of the Whalers, the team remains a focus of civic pride among Connecticut residents. The retired jersey numbers still hang on green and white banner from the rafters of the former Hartford Civic Center (now called the XL Center) where the team played in Hartford. Aside from the jersey numbers officially retired by the team, the banners include former team members Ulf Samuelsson (#5), Gordie Howe (#9), Ron Francis (#10), and Kevin Dineen (#11), which were symbolically added by Hartford Wolf Pack management in honor of the players in 2006, nine years after the team departure.\nMany fans have continued to follow the team after its move to North Carolina, however some have boycotted the team as former players from Hartford were traded to other teams or retired. Loyalty remains focused on the team's Hartford years, with new Whalers merchandise sales alone among the highest selling brands in the NHL as of August 2010. This continued popularity throughout the intervening years has led to many efforts to bring NHL Hockey back to Hartford by individuals such as Hartford real estate magnate and former XL Center operator Larry Gottesdiener and former Whalers franchise owner Howard Baldwin.\nEfforts to attract new NHL Team.\nSeveral efforts have been made over the years to revive NHL hockey by promoting the Hartford market for a new or relocated NHL franchise.\nLarry Gottesdiener, head of Northland Investment Group, has scouted for years for an NHL franchise to bring to Hartford. Northland, a firm heavily invested in Hartford real estate, jointly operated XL Center from 2007–10. Gottesdiener hoped to bring a new team temporarily to the XL Center until a modern arena could be built in a possible deal with the state. The new team would have likely been named after the Whalers, as at least some of the logos associated with the \"Whalers\" franchise were registered by Northland until 2009, when the registration with the patent office expired. Northland has since divested of its share in the XL Center, and appears to have abandoned its attempts to attract an NHL team.\nFormer Whalers owner Howard Baldwin has sponsored numerous events such the \"Whalers Reunion and Fan Fest\" in August 2010 featuring charitable events and appearances by former players. His company planned the \"Whalers Hockey Fest and Whale Bowl\", a hockey festival in East Hartford, Connecticut at Rentschler Field held in February 2011. The festival featured over 20 outdoor high school and college hockey games and an AHL Outdoor Classic contest featuring the Connecticut Whale and the Providence Bruins.\nMinor League.\nAfter the NHL team, the Hartford Whalers, left for North Carolina in 1997, the minor league Hartford Wolf Pack relocated from Binghamton, NY to Hartford. The Wolf Pack had a previous relationship with Hartford in the 1980s as the Whaler's AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Whalers, until they started their current affiliation with New York Rangers in 1990. In 2010, the team announced it was changing its name to the Connecticut Whale, to honor hockey tradition in Hartford started by the Whalers. The name reverted to the Wolf Pack in 2012.\nDanbury.\nDanbury has a fairly short history of minor league hockey from mostly independent leagues (no affiliation with the NHL). Most of the teams succumbed to budget and management problems. Danbury teams played at the Danbury Ice Arena, built in 1999 and renovated in 2004 just before the Danbury Trashers began play.\nThe Danbury Whalers of the Federal Hockey League (FHL) were named in honor of the former Hartford Whalers NHL hockey team. The team and the FHL league have no affiliation with the NHL or any NHL franchise. The Danbury Titans replaced the Whalers in the FHL in the 2015–16 season but would also fold after two seasons"

In July 1971 at its annual meeting, the ILTF voted to ban all WCT contract professionals from their tournaments and facilities from the beginning of 1972 onwards. This meant that leading WCT players such as Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Arthur Ashe and John Newcombe did not initially have permission to compete in the Grand Prix circuit and Newcombe could not defend his two consecutive Wimbledon titles of 1970 and 1971. In April 1972, however, an agreement was reached between the ILTF and WCT that divided the 1973 tour in a WCT circuit that ran from January through April and a Grand Prix circuit that was scheduled for the rest of the year.

The creation of the Grand Prix circuit, on an experimental basis during its first year, was announced in April 1970 by the president of the ILTF, Ben Barnett. It was the brainchild of Jack Kramer, former tennis promoter and winner of the Wimbledon and US championships, and was aimed at countering the influence of commercial promoters, particularly Lamar Hunt and his World Championship Tennis circuit and George MacCall's National Tennis League.\nThe tournaments were graded in one of three categories which determined the number of ranking points available: Class A, comprising the three Grand Slam tournaments, Class 1 and Class 2. The Pepsi-Cola Masters and Davis Cup Final are included in this calendar but did not count towards the Grand Prix. In addition to the tournament prize money a bonus pool of $150,000 was available for the top 20 ranked players. The bonus pool was jointly funded by Pepsi-Cola as title sponsor and the participating tournaments which reserved 10% of their prize money. Cliff Richey earned $25,000 bonus as the winner of the first Grand Prix circuit. At the end of the season the top six ranked players qualified for a Masters round-robin tournament held in Tokyo which was won by Stan Smith.\nAll open tennis tournaments were eligible to be included in the Grand Prix circuit provided they committed to not paying any management fees to commercial organizations with players under contract.
