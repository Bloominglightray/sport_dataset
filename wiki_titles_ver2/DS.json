        "text": "The Super Bowl of Poker (also known as Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker or SBOP) was the second most prestigious poker tournament in the world during the 1980s. While the World Series of Poker was already drawing larger crowds as more and more amateurs sought it out, the SBOP \"was an affair limited almost exclusively to pros and hard-core amateurs.\"\nPrior to 1979, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP. 1972 WSOP Main Event Champion and outspoken ambassador for poker Amarillo Slim saw this as an opportunity. \"The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament,\" he said. Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in February 1979. Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament \"more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire.\" Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event.\nOne of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure. The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool. The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure. In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third. This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.\n1986 Tournament.\nJack Keller, a member of the Poker Hall of Fame, won the Pot Limit Omaha in the 1986 SBOP. But it was the Deuce-to-Seven Lowball event that may have had the toughest final three competitors ever. Doyle Brunson, a Poker Hall of Famer, has won ten WSOP bracelets and won this event. In order to win, he had to defeat two other Poker Hall Famers. Billy Baxter, who owns 7 bracelets, came in second place while Johnny Chan, the third-place finisher, is tied with Doyle for the second most bracelets at 10. T. J. Cloutier, another member of the Hall, and Jack Keller both won separate $500 Limit Hold'em events."

        "text": "The Israel Tennis Association (the ITA; Hebrew: איגוד הטניס בישראל), founded in 1950, is the national governing body for the sport of tennis in Israel. The ITA governs the arrangements for Israeli tennis leagues and tournaments, Israel's Davis Cup participation, and Israeli participation in tennis tournaments abroad. It has a history of stormy relationships with some of Israel's top players and the Israel Tennis Centers.\n1980–88: Chairman Harnik I.\nDavid \"Dedi\" Harnik was chairman of the ITA from 1980 to 1988.\n1988–90: State of turbulence.\nKollie Friedstein, also the executive director of the Israel Tennis Centers (\"ITC\") and one of the founders of Kibbutz Shoval in the Negev, become chairman of the ITA in 1988 for a 2-year period, at which time \"a state of turbulence\" existed between the ITA and the ITC. Appointed to head both bodies at the same time, Friedstein felt that by 1990 he had succeeded in bringing \"industrial peace\" between them.\n1990: Chairman Harnik II.\nIn October 1990 Harnik was re-elected chairman of the ITA, a position that he held for many years.\n1996: Mansdorf dispute.\nIn early 1996, Amos Mansdorf got into a tiff with the ITA when he accused it of mismanagement, suggesting that it was run in \"an amateur fashion\".\n2005: Dispute with Davis Cup players.\nIn 2005, during at the peak of a disagreement between the Israeli Davis Cup players and the ITA, Eyal Ran was made Israeli Davis Cup captain. Ran spoke to the players and the association and settled the crisis.\n2006: Return of pro tennis to Israel planned/cancelled.\nThe ITA announced the return of professional tennis to Israel in 2006; the Anda Open high-level WTA tournament for top women players, featuring more than US$140,000 (NIS 643,000) in prize money. But the ITA cancelled the tournament in August 2006, citing the precarious security situation in the region. The ITA said the decision to cancel the event was taken after Sony Ericsson WTA Tour CEO Larry Scott wrote to them informing them that under the circumstances, the event could not be held. The 2007 tournament remained on the calendar.\n2008.\nAt the same time, the Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" was bringing the ITA and the Israeli Tennis Center to task for squabbling with each other to the detriment of the development of Israeli tennis.\nIn 2008 Israel's top singles player, Dudi Sela, was very angry at the Israeli Olympic Committee and the ITA which decided not to send him to the Olympics in Beijing. \"It maddens me that I am not taking part in the Olympics,\" Sela said. \"Everyone ranked in the top 100 will be there except for me. In the past some players ranked in the bottom 100 have even taken gold medals. But for Israel being ranked in the top 100 is not enough. Not since the days of former Israeli tennis player Amos Mansdorf has Israel been in the top tier of the Davis Cup, and I carried us there. After such an achievement they still don't appreciate me enough to send me to the Olympics. This has sapped my motivation to play in the next Davis Cup.\" He continued, \"No one gets how mad I am at the Association. Who am I playing tennis for in the Davis Cup? For myself?\"\nThe ITA ultimately sided with Sela, but was overruled by the Olympic Committee of Israel (OCI). The decision to leave Sela out enraged the ITA, which appealed immediately, to no avail. The director of Israel's Elite Sport Department, Gilad Lustig, had no regrets of the OCI's decision, and put the blame in part on the ITA. \"We set the criteria after a very long process and all the different associations, including the ITA, gave their approval,\" he maintained.\n2009: Ramat Hasharon vs. Nokia Stadium dispute.\nOver the protests of all four of their own players (including Harel Levy, who said: \"\"Only Ramat Hasharon. We're not even thinking about Nokia. There's no reason to play against the Russians indoors – we love Ramat Hasharon\"), who preferred to play outdoors in the heat on the hard court of Canada Stadium in Ramat Hashoaron which they were accustomed to, the ITA moved the tie against Russia in 2009 to the larger indoor Nokia Stadium. But the ITA was sensitive to the fact that the indoor arena has a capacity of 11,000 – more than double that of the Canada Stadium. ITA CEO Moshe Haviv denied that his prime consideration was the extra money such a move would bring in, and said the larger stadium would give more Israelis the chance to see the national team play, and allow them to watch the sport in more comfortable conditions.\nThe Israel Tennis Center (ITC) turning to the Tel Aviv District Court in an effort to prevent the ITA from playing the matches at the Nokia Stadium rather than the Canada Stadium in Ramat Hasharon, claiming that the previous ITA chairman, Assaf Hefetz, had given the ITA a written guarantee that future Davis Cup and Fed Cup ties would be played at Ramat Hasharon after the ITC renovated the venue in 2008. The court ruled in favor of the ITA, however, after the sides failed to reach a compromise as Judge Yehuda Fargo had suggested. \"The stadium at Ramat Hasharon doesn't fit the requirements for such a world class event, and therefore it is better off to play at Nokia,\" said Fargo. \"I think this is the wrong decision,\" ITC CEO Janine Strauss said. \"It was important for the players to play at Ramat Hasharon.\""

The head coach was Frank Martin, who served his 3rd year at the helm of the Wildcats. The team played its home games in Bramlage Coliseum in Manhattan, Kansas. Kansas State is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The Wildcats began conference play with a trip to Columbia, Missouri and faced the Missouri Tigers and finished the year with a home game against the Iowa State Cyclones. They finished the season 29–8 and ranked #7 in the AP Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll. They lost to the rival Kansas Jayhawks in the finals of the Big 12 tournament, 72–64.\nThe team received a #2 seed for the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, and beat North Texas and BYU to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where the Wildcats faced Xavier. The KSU-Xavier game was a double-overtime thriller won by Kansas State 101-96, which CBSSports.com called \"one of the best games in the history of the Sweet 16.\" Kansas State lost in the next round to Butler.\nRecruiting.\nThe following is a list of the recruits that are on the 2009-10 roster.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big 12 tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament\nRecord breaking season.\nKansas State earned its highest ranking since the 1987–88 season on December 14, as the Wildcats jumped into The Associated Press Top 25 poll for the first time this season at No. 17. K-State also appeared in the ESPN/USA Today poll at No. 22. The team had been receiving votes in both polls since the preseason. The Wildcats are ranked for the first time in the AP poll since the 2007–08 season when the squad was ranked No. 24 on Feb. 19, 2008. K-State appeared in the poll eight times during the season, including 18th twice on Nov. 20, 2007 and Feb. 12, 2008. The last time the team was ranked as high or higher than 17th was during the 1987-88 when the Wildcats were 14th on Feb. 9, 1988. It is also the highest ranking prior to conference play since K-State was ranked No. 14 in the preseason poll in 1975.\nOn December 21, Kansas State's rise in the polls reached historical levels, as the Wildcats earned their highest ranking in nearly 36 years on Monday at number 12 in The Associated Press Top 25. Those rankings marked the first ranking since the 2007-08 season when the team checked in at number 24 on Feb. 19, 2008. It is the highest ranking in the AP poll since head coach Jack Hartman led the Wildcats to a number 9 ranking in the poll on March 13, 1973, with a 23-5 record. In addition, it is the highest ranking prior to conference play since K-State was ranked No. 10 in the preseason poll in 1965. The two wins over ranked non-conference teams are a first since the 1958-59 squad knocked off number 4 N.C. State (69-67) and number 14 St. Joseph's (68-55) on consecutive days on Dec. 19-20, 1958. The eight 80-point games after 11 games are the most in school history.\nWith the win over Cleveland State on December 29, the Wildcats moved to 12-1 on the season and are off to their best start since the 1958–59 squad also began 12-1. Also, the last time a K-State team won nine games in a row was back in 1997-98, when that squad won its first nine games of the season.\nOn January 12, Kansas State beat Texas A&amp;M 88-65. The victory set a new record for consecutive home wins at Bramlage Coliseum with 13. The school record for consecutive home victories is 20, which occurred in Ahearn Fieldhouse that stretched from January 1981 to January 1982.\nOn February 15, Kansas State rose to a number 7 ranking. It is the highest in The Associated Press poll in almost 50 years since the Wildcats were ranked sixth on March 13, 1962. It is the highest ranking in the Coaches' poll since \"USA Today\" took over ownership of the poll in 1991-92.\nThe Wildcats have now been ranked among the nation's Top 25 in both polls for 10 consecutive weeks, while they have been ranked among the AP Top 15 for seven straight weeks. It is the longest stretch in the Top 25 since ranking 16 consecutive weeks in the AP poll from 1972–73, while it is the longest stretch in the AP Top 15 since the 1961–62 team was among the Top 10 for 14 weeks in a row from Dec. 19, 1961 to March 13, 1962. Kansas State is off to its best start in nearly 50 years with a 20-4 overall mark. The record ties for the fifth-best start in school history and the best since the 1961–62 squad opened the year at 21-3. The team posted their 20th win of the season against Colorado on 13 February, becoming the first team to tally 20 or more wins in four consecutive seasons. Head coach Frank Martin also became the first head coach to post three 20-win seasons to start a career. It is also the earliest a K-State squad has won 20 games, surpassing the 1958-59 team that won its 20th game on Feb. 16, 1959."

This set off a melee that saw Drummond get a flagrant foul and four technicals called. Following the game, Johnson said \"That was nasty, but that's basketball. I don't expect anything less from anybody that's trying to win. Frustration sets in when you want to win—no hard feelings.\" When asked to comment on the dunk itself, Johnson remarked, \"That was nasty, right? I cocked that joint back and banged on him!\" Johnson's quote, combined with the dunk, garnered social media buzz by Raptor fans, gaining popularity as a catchphrase associated with him to the point that it once spawned online T-shirt sales featuring his quote printed on T-shirts by an entrepreneur for a charitable campaign.\nOn February 21, 2015, Johnson scored a career-high 27 points in a 76–98 loss to the Houston Rockets.\nMiami Heat (2016–2020).\nOn July 10, 2016, Johnson signed a one-year, $4 million contract with the Miami Heat.

        "text": "The Hayt Golf Learning Center, also known as the \"Golfplex\" is the golf facility on the University of North Florida campus. It is a public course and the practice facility for the North Florida Ospreys golf team.\nHistory.\nThe concept of the Hayt Center began when former golf head coach John Brooks met with former UNF president Adam Herbert and former athletic director Dr. Richard Gropper and was promised the land. Brooks coordinated the funding, design and construction of the center. Local businessman John Hayt initially donated $750,000 to the project. With Hayt's later donation of another $200,000, a $100,000 donation from The First Tee, state funds, and other gifts, the project received about $2 million. UNF did not have to use any funds for the project. The course was designed by professional golfer Mark McCumber. The Hayt Center opened in 2002 and provided the UNF golf team and the campus with its first facility.\nFeatures.\nThe center is set on on the southeast part of the campus. It features two par threes, and a final hole that can be played as a par 3, 4, or 5. Golf News called the third hole \"possibly the best in the area.\" The center also comprises a lighted driving range and chipping &amp; putting area, and building. It is an \"all walking\" course, which means there are no golf carts."

        "title": "List of New Zealand national rugby league team players",
        "text": "There have been 828 rugby league footballers who have played for the New Zealand national rugby league team since the national side started competing internationally in 1907. Players are listed according to the date of their first international test match. The below list is the official roll of honour and only lists players who have played a test match for the Kiwis or have gone away on a tour with the squad. The list does not include players who only played non-tests in New Zealand or who were unused substitutions in test matches. The New Zealand Rugby League omitted Ed St George as early records were poorly kept and it was assumed the \"St George\" who played for New Zealand in 1932 was Neville St George who debuted for New Zealand in 1925. It was however his younger brother Allen (Ed) St George. He has been added to the NZRL Roll of Honour and given the number 220a.\nDual internationals.\nSeveral of the original New Zealand team had already represented New Zealand in rugby union. This trend has continued with many players representing New Zealand in two sports or representing two different countries in rugby league due to the eligibility rules in place at the time. For example, Dally Messenger represented Australia in both rugby union and rugby league as well as playing with the 1907 touring side.\nOf the 36 players that have played for both the Kiwis and the All Blacks, only Karl Ifwersen, Sonny Bill Williams, and Roger Tuivasa-Sheck have been a Kiwi before they became an All Black.\nAs well as the dual internationals below, Charles Savory won the New Zealand National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing championship in 1914, while Sonny Bill Williams won the New Zealand Professional Boxing Association Heavyweight Championship in 2012.\nCharles Finlayson was Kiwi #100 and played for the Kiwis in 1913. Then in 1928 he played for New Zealand at cricket against Australia, although the match was not an official test match. The only player to play for New Zealand at rugby league and then an official test match in cricket for New Zealand was Verdun Scott who achieved the feat in 1939 and 1946 respectively.\nKiwi 221, Wilf Hassan became the New Zealand Diving champion in 1934 and 1935, and Kiwi captain Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene became a Member of Parliament after his retirement from rugby league.\nFour Kiwis have gone on to be test referees; Albert House, Maurice Wetherill, Vic Belsham and Henry Perenara.\nNumbering.\nThe general rule is that a player does not become a Kiwi until he actually plays in the jersey. However this rule is ignored for players who tour with the squad and do not get capped, these players still qualify as Kiwis.\nDue to incomplete records, before 1939 touring teams are listed by alphabetical order and home teams are listed by position from fullback to the forwards. Post War players are listed in order of appearance."

        "text": "The 2009–10 IRB Sevens World Series was the eleventh of an annual series of rugby union sevens tournaments for full national sides run by the International Rugby Board since 1999–2000. Samoa won the IRB Sevens World Series crown for their first time.\nSevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. However, the most famous event, the Hong Kong Sevens, is played over three days, largely because it involves 24 teams instead of the normal 16.\nThe 2009-10 Series was won by Samoa, who won four of the eight tournaments and placed second in two others. Samoa were led by top try-scorer Mikaele Pesamino, who led the Series with 56 tries.\nItinerary.\nThe series' tournaments were identical to those in 2008–09 and spanned the globe, visiting five of the six populated continents.\nTwo minor changes were made to the schedule:\nCore teams.\nBefore each season, the IRB announces the 12 \"core teams\" that will receive guaranteed berths in each event in that season's series. The core teams for 2009–10 were:\nThe core teams were unchanged from 2008–09; the most recent change came before that season, when the USA replaced its neighbor Canada.\nPoints schedule.\nThe season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. Effective with this season, the IRB changed the points allocations for all events as follows:\nTournament structure.\nIn all tournaments except Hong Kong, 16 teams participate. Due to its place as the sport's most prestigious annual event, the Hong Kong tournament has 24 teams. In each 16-team tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss. The first tiebreaker is the head-to-head result between the tied teams, followed by difference in points scored during the tournament.\nFour trophies are awarded in each tournament. In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. The Shield was contested in Hong Kong for the first time in 2010. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\nIn a 16-team tournament, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third- and fourth-place finishers in each pool, with the losers in the Bowl quarterfinals dropping into the bracket for the Shield.\nThe Hong Kong Sevens adopted a new structure effective with its 2010 edition. As in previous years, the 24 teams were divided into six pools of four teams each, with the competition points system and tiebreakers identical to those for a 16-team event. Also as in the past, the six pool winners and the two top second-place finishers advanced to the Cup competition. The changes made in 2010 were:\nFinal standings.\nThe points awarded to teams at each event, as well as the overall season totals, are shown in the table below. Points for the event winners are indicated in bold. A zero (0) is recorded in the event column where a team competed in a tournament but did not gain any points. A dash (–) is recorded in the event column if a team did not compete at a tournament.\nNotes:\n\"Light blue line on the left indicates a core team eligible to participate in all events of the series.\""

Wotherspoon played one game in the 1891 Championship, which saw Scotland win all three matches making Wotherspoon a Triple Crown winning player.\nPersonal history.\nWotherspoon was born in Aberdour, Fife in 1868 to Charles Grey Wotherspoon, a barrister of Aberdour. Wotherspoon was educated at Loretto School before being accepted into Clare College, Cambridge in 1887, gaining a BA in 1891.\nHe came back to Fife to play cricket for Burntisland, with his brother.\nA sometimes Assistant Master of Blairlodge School in Stirlingshire (which is today a Young Offenders Institute), Wotherspoon became a barrister for Nobel's explosive factory in London. In 1902 he married Annie Manning, the youngest daughter of William Arthur Judkins of Northamptonshire.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Fettesian-Lorettonians.\nWotherspoon then played for Cambridge University team during his student years, winning a sporting blue in 1888 and 1889.\nHe then played for London Scottish.\nIn 1892 Wotherspoon, a master at Borlase School, Marlow played for the newly formed High Wycombe RFC.\nBack in Scotland, Wotherspoon played for West of Scotland.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for East of Scotland District against West of Scotland District in 1891.\nHe was selected for Middlesex to play against Yorkshire in the 1893 English County Championship. Five Scots were selected for Middlesex: Gregor MacGregor, George Campbell, William Wotherspoon, Robert MacMillan and Frederick Goodhue, all with London Scottish who played in the county. He played in that match, but Yorkshire won and then secured the championship.\nInternational career.\nWhilst still at university he was selected to represent the Scottish national team, coming into the team to face Ireland away, in the 1891 Home Nations Championship. It was a celebrated start for Wotherspoon, scoring three tries in his debut in a 14-0 victory of the Irish. This raised Wotherspoon's status within rugby: although he did not appear in the last game of the Championship against England, he was then chosen to represent the first official British Isles team to tour, travelling to South Africa in 1891.\nThe 1891 tour of South Africa took in three Tests against South Africa and 17 games against regional and invitational sides. Wotherspoon played in the first match of the tour against Cape Town, and was given kicking duties, scoring two conversions and two penalty goals. He missed the next four games, but was back against Port Elizabeth and then Eastern Province, scoring two tries in each match. He faced the South African national team, in the first Test, played at Port Elizabeth, where he was partnered at half back with Arthur Rotherham. The tourists won the game 4-0.\nOn his return to Britain Wotherspoon was reselected for the Scottish team, playing in a win over Ireland in the 1892 Championship. He played in two games during the 1893 Home Nations Championship, facing Wales and England; in 1894 he completed his first full tournament. He played all three matches in the 1894 Championship, switching from half-back to centre in the second game (against Ireland), when Scotland adopted the four threequarter system that season."

        "text": "Howard Marshall OBE (20 December 1870 – 9 October 1929) was an English rugby union half-back who played club rugby for Blackheath and Richmond and was a member of the first official British Isles tour in 1891. Marshall played just one game for England, scoring a hat-trick of tries on his debut.\nPersonal life.\nMarshall was born in Sunderland in 1870 to John Ferrow Marshall, a ship-owner. He was educated at several schools, including Barnard Castle and Norfolk County, before gaining entry into Caius College, Cambridge in 1888. Although Marshall would later have a notable rugby career, he did not win a sporting Blue while at Cambridge.\nMarshall first entered medicine when he joined the medical college, St. Bartholomew's, becoming a House Surgeon and the Clinical Assistant in the Throat Department. He later became an Assistant House Surgeon at Nottingham General Hospital, before becoming a General practitioner at Bexhill-on-Sea and Cirencester. From 1910 he became a surgeon at Cirencester Memorial Hospital. Marshall was the medical officer to the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester and was also the civil surgeon to the 4th Battalion of the Gloucester Regiment. On the outbreak of World War I, Bingham Hall in Cirencester was turned into a Red Cross Hospital and Marshall was made medical officer in charge of it. For his services in Cirencester during the war he was awarded the OBE.\nRugby career.\nMarshall played for several club teams during his rugby career, and in 1890 he was representing first-class English team Blackheath. That season saw William Percy Carpmael, a fellow Blackheath player, form the invitational touring team, the Barbarians; and Marshall was asked to join the club on their first tour. On the first tour Marshall had the distinction of scoring the first ever points in Wales by a Barbarian player, when he scored a try against Cardiff. Marshall later became a committee member for the Barbarians.\nIn 1891 Marshall was selected for another rugby first, when he was chosen to represent the British Isles team on their first official overseas tour. Played in South Africa, the British Isles team faced 17 regional and invitational teams, and three international Tests against South Africa national team. Marshall played in two international games, paired with Edward Bromet in the Second Test at Kimberley and then with Arthur Rotherham in the third and final Test, at Cape Town.\nIn 1893 Marshall played his one and only England international tour when he was selected to face Wales as part of the Home Nations Championship. The game became famous after the pitch was prevented from freezing over when hundreds of braziers were left burning on the pitch over night; leaving multiple black circles on the pitch during the match. Marshall had an incredible debut, scoring a hat-trick of tries, but incredibly finished on the losing side after a great Welsh come back. Despite his high try scoring debut, this was his only international cap for England."

        "text": "The Super Bowl of Poker (also known as Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker or SBOP) was the second most prestigious poker tournament in the world during the 1980s. While the World Series of Poker was already drawing larger crowds as more and more amateurs sought it out, the SBOP \"was an affair limited almost exclusively to pros and hard-core amateurs.\"\nPrior to 1979, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP. 1972 WSOP Main Event Champion and outspoken ambassador for poker Amarillo Slim saw this as an opportunity. \"The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament,\" he said. Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979. Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament \"more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire.\" Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event.\nOne of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure. The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool. The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure. In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third. This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.\n1982 tournament.\nPuggy Pearson is the Poker Hall of Famer who is credited with coming up with the concept of a freeze-out tournament. As a four-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner, Pearson was well known in poker circles. In 1982, Puggy was playing Chuck Bemus heads up in the \"Follow the Stars\" tournament. The \"Follow the Stars\" tournament was known for offering a prize equal to half the total buy-in and a new car. Pearson was one of two future Poker Hall of Famers to win a SBOP tournament in 1982; the other one was Chip Reese, who won the $10,000 Deuce to Seven Lowball event."

        "title": "Dick King (American football)",
        "text": "Richard Stewart Cutter King (February 9, 1895 - October 16, 1930) was an American football running back. He played college football for Harvard University and was selected as an All-American at halfback) in 1915. In 1916, he signed with the Pine Village professional football team, becoming one of the first eastern football stars to play professional football. He also played professionally for the Hammond Pros, Milwaukee Badgers, Rochester Jeffersons, and St. Louis All-Stars.\nAthlete and All-American at Harvard.\nA native of Boston, Massachusetts, King attended the Boston Latin School before enrolling at Harvard University. He was 5 feet, 8 inches in height and weighed 175 pounds. At the time of his selection as an All-American in 1915, King was not the typical Harvard athlete. He was married and had two children (a two-year-old daughter and a six-month-old son), and was working his way through college. He first tried out for the freshman football team in 1912. At that time, he knew little or nothing about the game and \"did not even threaten to 'make' the team.\" He failed to make the varsity team as sophomore and was also rejected by the baseball team and crew. In 1914, King made the cut for Harvard's varsity football team, but saw limited playing time as a substitute.\nKing did not start a game for Harvard until his senior year, and was selected as an All-American in his first full year playing the game. He played halfback for the 1915 Harvard team that boasted one of the best backfields in the early years of college football with King, Eddie Mahan and Hardwick. With Harvard's opponents focused on stopping three-time All-American Mahan, King was able to score the only touchdown on a 30-yard run in Harvard's 1915 victory over Princeton. After King's \"long leap in the lair of the Princeton Tigers,\" one writer noted King's progression from scrub to star: \"Stubborn Dick King, once the lowliest of scrubs, now stands full flush at the entrance to the Harvard gallery of big football heroes.\"\nAt the end of the 1915 season, Walter Camp and Fielding H. Yost both named King to their first-team All-American squads, and Chicago football expert Walter Eckersall selected him as a second-team All-American.\nFootball coach at Wisconsin.\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1916, King accepted a position as the backfield coach for the University of Wisconsin. He served in that capacity for only one year. The \"Wisconsin State Journal\" called him one of the school's most important coaches, noting that he had instilled his \"fighting spirit\" in the Wisconsin backfield. In October 1916, King announced that he had been offered a position as an engineer with a South American mining operation. He planned to leave for South America at the conclusion of the football season.\nPioneer of professional football.\nIn November 1916, while still serving as a coach at Wisconsin, King signed with \"the famous Pine Village team\"—one of the first professional football teams. King was hired as both a player and coach, and was the highest paid player on the team. In signing with Pine Village, King became \"one of the first of the eastern greats to step into the pro ranks.\" Prior to 1917, professional football had attracted only a narrow following, principally in Ohio and Indiana. Professional football was viewed as unworthy of graduates of major universities, and college stars who played in the early days of professional football frequently used assumed names to hide their identities.\nIn 1916, the Pine Village team consisted of King and a group of former players from Indiana University. By signing King, Pine Village hoped to bring the sophistication of Eastern football to Indiana.\nIn December 1916, Pine Village played a highly anticipated game against the Hammond Pros for the championship of Indiana. In the build-up to the game, one Indiana newspaper focused on Pine Village's acquisition of King:\"The Pine Village aggregation is one of the strongest in the entire country and is composed almost entirely of ex-college players who have won berths on All-American, All-Western and All-Conference elevens. Among the stars with Pine Village are Dick King, of Harvard, All-American halfback in 1915, and the greatest fullback playing today. He is the highest salaried player on the Pine Village team and his stipend per game runs well into three figures. King is a wonderful line plunger and on nearly all of his runs carries from three to five men along with him for several yards.\"\nKing continued to play for Pine Village from 1917–1919, and was known both for his coaching and his \"line-plunging\" skills. In 1919, a Fort Wayne newspaper noted:\"King acts as coach for the Pine Village outfit and local fandom can expect to see some wonderful interference displayed by the Pine Village team. King is a firm believer in interference, profiting by his experience at Harvard, where this branch of the game went a long way in making Harvard teams invincible in the four years preceding the war.\"The publicity for the fledgling Indiana professional circuit may have peaked in 1919 when Hammond signed another major eastern star, quarterback Eddy from Princeton. King was the star of the Indiana league, and when the teams featuring King and Eddy met in November 1919, one Indiana newspaper noted, \"King hits the line like a streak and is seldom stopped before he reaches the secondary defense.\" In another article, an Indiana paper wrote, \"King needs no introduction to local fans, as he is a former All-American back with a country wide reputation and perhaps the greatest line plunger in the game today.\"\nKing also played for the Hammond Pros from 1919 to 1921, the Milwaukee Badgers and Rochester Jeffersons in 1922, and the St. Louis All-Stars in 1923.\nThe 1919 Hammond Pros, featuring King (and a rookie named George Halas), had a payroll of $20,000 for eleven players, said to be one of the highest team payrolls in the history of professional football to that time. Also in 1919, an Indiana newspaper called King \"one of the greatest backs who ever wore moleskins\" and noted: \"As a line plunger, King ranks with the best in the game, while his ability to place kick from anywhere within the 50-yard mark makes a score possible for his team whenever the ball is advanced into enemy territory.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nKing's first marriage, to Hazel Hatch, ended in divorce in May 1918. On March 1, 1919, at Crown Point Indiana King married Vera I Ketrick of Chicago. The marriage of the famous football player to Ketrick drew press attention focusing on the fact that King's new bride was a two-time divorcee. One Indiana newspaper reported: \"Famous Football Player, Once Divorced, Takes a Twice Divorced Wife.\"\nKing died of pneumonia on October 16, 1930, at a hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, where he had been working as a South American sales representative for the Gillette Company."

        "text": "Robert Thomas (1871 – 7 March 1910) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Morriston and Swansea. Thomas was a Triple Crown winner, after representing Wales for all three matches on the 1900 Home Nations Championship.\nRugby career.\nThomas began his rugby playing career for local clubs across the Swansea area, before joining Morriston. Morriston was well known for providing players to first class club Swansea, and in 1892 Thomas too joined the team. Despite joining Swansea in 1892, it took until 1900 for him to be selected for the Wales national squad, joining the team in the opening match of the 1900 Home Nations Championship, played at Gloucester against England. The Welsh team saw an influx of new players, mainly brought into the back positions, but Thomas was one of two new caps in the forwards, along with Pontymister's William Williams. Wales won the game 13–3, and the Welsh selector's reacted by keeping faith with the Welsh forwards for the next game, apart from the enforced change of Dick Hellings. Played at Swansea's home ground at St. Helens, Thomas was part of the Welsh team to beat Scotland in another convincing win, this time by 12 points to three. The final game of the Championship was played at Belfast against Ireland, and with the Hellings returning the pack was back to the same line up as the first game of the tournament. A single try by Welsh centre George Davies gave Wales the win and their second Triple Crown, and made Thomas a Championship winning player. \nThomas played just one more international game, the opening match of the 1901 Home Nations Championship, facing England for the second time in his career. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Thomas again found himself on the winning side, but the next game he was replaced by William Alexander. Thomas finished his international career with four wins out of four.\nAt the end of the 1900/01 season Thomas retired from rugby and Swansea RFC responded by awarding him badges, 'up to the value of £10', but the presentation was not sanctioned by the Welsh Rugby Union. The argument of professionalism surrounded rugby union, and after the fallout from The Gould Affair, the WRU were worried of any international sanctions.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nPersonal history.\nThomas was a steel tube millman at the Mannesmann Tube Works in Landore. In 1905 he was involved in an industrial accident at his place of work when a pair of tongs went through his right hand, injuring him severely. The incident scarred him mentally as well as physically."

        "title": "Chris O'Brien (American football)",
        "text": "Christopher O'Brien (October 23, 1881 – June 3, 1951) was a Chicago, Illinois house painter and plumber who became a pro football franchise owner. He is mostly known as the owner of the Chicago Cardinals (later known as the St. Louis Cardinals, and now the Arizona Cardinals), and has been called the \"Father of Professional Football in Chicago\". O'Brien was also a co-founder of the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922) by representing the Cardinals (then called the Racine Cardinals) at the September 17, 1920, league meeting at Ralph Hay's Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio.\nEarly Cardinals ownership.\nIn 1898, O'Brien organized the Morgan Athletic Club. He and his brother Pat also played on the squad. Chris then changed the club's home games to nearby Normal Field, prompting the new name the Normals. That same year O'Brien gave the team its longstanding moniker when he, finding a bargain, bought used football jerseys from the nearby University of Chicago. Because the jerseys had long since faded from Chicago's traditional maroon color, O'Brien declared, \"That's not maroon, it's Cardinal red!\" He renamed the team the Racine Cardinals, because Normal Field was located on Racine Avenue in Chicago.\nFootball in the Chicago area was mostly amateur in the early 1900s, with opponents almost impossible to book, let alone find. This caused O'Brien to suspend the team from 1906 until 1913. By 1917, O'Brien was able to buy new uniforms as well as hire a coach, Marshall Smith. That year the Cardinals won the Chicago City Championship. However, World War I forced the Cardinals to suspend operations again in 1918. After the war, the Cardinals were reorganized, and have played without interruption since then.\nFounding the NFL.\nIn 1919, Ralph Hay and George Halas saw the popularity of O'Brien's Cardinals in the Chicago area as a boost to the new league. O'Brien saw this an opportunity to keep costs down and prevent players from jumping from team to team. He traveled to Canton, Ohio in September 1920 and represented Racine (Chicago) at the league meeting. O'Brien's attendance made the Cardinals a charter member of the new league.\nIn the NFL.\nIn 1920, O'Brien lured great halfback John \"Paddy\" Driscoll to the Cardinals for $3,000 a year, a sum considered outlandish at the time. The following year, he moved the team's home games to Comiskey Park and the team officially became the Chicago Cardinals, so that they would not be confused with a new NFL franchise, the Racine Legion from Racine, Wisconsin.\nThat same year, in 1920, with the Chicago Tigers and Cardinals competing for the same fan dollar, O’Brien offered—and the Tigers’ boss Guil Falcon agreed—to play for the right to represent the city of Chicago in the APFA. The winner would remain as the city’s only professional team; the loser would fold operations. Driscoll scored the game’s only touchdown on a 40-yard run and the Cardinals won 6–3. As promised, the Tigers dropped out of competition, becoming the first NFL/APFA team to fold and finished the season with a 2–5–1 record.\nIn 1921, George Halas, owner of the Decatur Staleys, requested permission from the NFL and from O'Brien to move his team to Chicago. Although the Cardinals win over the Tigers gave O'Brien the right to block any professional team from settling in Chicago, O'Brien approved the request for unknown reasons. With O'Brien's and NFL approval, Halas renamed his team the Chicago Staleys, changing the name again to the Chicago Bears in 1922. This move would come back to haunt the Cardinals. The Bears quickly replaced the Cardinals as Chicago's favorite team. After years of futile attempts to compete with the Bears, the Cardinals moved to St. Louis in 1960.\n1925 Championship.\nO'Brien presided over the Cardinals' first NFL title in 1925. However, it still carries controversy. On December 6, 1925, the Pottsville Maroons defeated the Cardinals, 21–7, to establish the best record in the league and seemed to all but officially clinch the NFL championship. NFL President Joseph Carr then suspended the Maroons for playing a team of University of Notre Dame All-Stars in Philadelphia (and winning 9–7) on the same day the Frankford Yellow Jackets were scheduled to play a game in Philadelphia, violating Frankford's franchise rights. Pottsville was unable to complete its 1925 schedule because of the suspension and was stripped of their title. Chicago, with the second-best record in the league, was declared the 1925 champion by default. Two of Chicago's games against the Hammond Pros and Milwaukee Badgers were also not played because the Pros disbanded and the Badgers were forced out of the league for using high school players. \nAlthough the NFL attempted to officially award the 1925 NFL championship to the Cardinals, they refused the title. At the time, O'Brien felt his team did not deserve it over a team which had beaten them fairly, and thus the 1925 championship was never officially awarded to anyone.\nSelling the Cards and legacy.\nAfter running the Cardinals for 28 years, O'Brien sold the team to Chicago physician David Jones in 1929 for $25,000.\nDespite his accomplishments as a pioneer and promoter for the early years of professional football, O'Brien has never been a finalist, let alone inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2022, he was named one of the 10 inaugural members for the Football Learning Academy's Hall of Honor, which looks to acknowledge icons not currently inducted in the hall."

        "text": "In March 1983, the West Bengal side from India came to Dhaka, for a short tour. The side was led by Dilip Doshi. The visitors convincingly won both their matches.\nThe 3 day Match (4–6 March 1983).\nBatting first, the tourists established an early control, as their opening pair of Palash Nandy and Pranab Roy posed a century partnership. Roy fell for 45, but Nandy went on to score a well made century (107). With Raja Venkat contributing 38, WB declared, early on the 2nd morning at 267/6. Yousuf Rahman was the most successful Bangladeshi bowler with 3/40.\nIn reply, the local side badly capitulated against the left arm spin of the WB captain. Doshi took 7/39 to dismiss the hosts for a meager 93. Only Raquibul with 26 and Rafiqul Alam with 20 could play him with any confidence.\nFollowing on, the local side needed to bat the whole of the third day to avoid an embarrassing defeat. Things started well, as the top order showed greater determination. Nazim 29, Raqibul Hasan 26 and Yousuf Rahman 18, took the score up to 76/2 at the lunch break. After that though, the middle order collapsed completely as the off spinner Sujan Mukherjee joined his captain in the carnage. The pair equally shared the 10 Bangladeshi wickets, as the hosts were bowled for 132. Only Rafiq, with 26, showed any resistance after lunch. Bangladesh lost the game by an innings and 42 runs. \nThe One-day (45 overs) Match (8 march, 1983).\nDespite the heavy defeat of the local side in the 3-day fixture, a good holiday crowd gathered to watch the 45 over match in the following Sunday. After the crushing defeat, the Bangladesh team went through big changes. Most interesting was the recall of the experienced all-rounder Omar Khaled Rumy.\nWest Bengal batted first, and after a brisk start Palash Nandy was run out. Left arm fast bowler, Dipu Chowdhury, then took 2 wickets in 2 balls to put the visitors under pressure. When Jahangir Shah bowled Prabir Chel, the WB side was struggling badly at 45/4.\nUnfortuantley for the local side, the back up bowlers failed to apply the same pressure, and WB middle order recovered. Pranab Roy with 59 &amp; left-hander Arup Bhattacharya with 54 gave the innings some stability. The tail collapsed against the gentle medium pace of Yousuf Rahman and the WB side was bowled out for only 175. Yousuf Rahman 3/18 &amp; Dipu Chowdhury 3/29 did most of the damage.\nThings started to go wrong for the local side even before they started their chase. Their most experienced opener Yousuf Rahman injured himself in the field, and did not bat at all. A reshuffled batting line up saw Assaduzzaman Misha join Nazim Shirazi in the opening partnership. Their inexperience in One day cricket was evident, as both of them got run out very cheaply. The experienced pair of Omar Khaled Rumy &amp; Raqibul Hasan, batted for a long time, but they failed to give the innings any momentum. Rumy scored a sluggish 20 while Raqibul top scored 27, but the rest of the batting collapsed against the WB spinners. Doshi, the nemesis of the Bangladesh batting, took 3/27, and Arup completed a splendid all round performance by taking 3/18. Bangladesh finished at 120/8, losing the match by 55 runs.\nThree members of the same family played for Bangladesh in this match. Jahangir Shah, a regular member of the side, was joined by his younger brother Nadir Shah (Now, an international umpire), and his much younger cousin Nazim Shirazi. The WB side included the Nandy brothers, Palash &amp; Pranob."

The Disc Golf Association | DGA, is the founding company of the sport of disc golf and was the acting overseeing body for the sport until the establishment of the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA). The PDGA was run by Ed Headrick and the DGA until 1982. They are a manufacturer of disc golf baskets for the sports of Disc Golf. The company does not have any retail stores, but rather sells disc golf courses to park departments, disc golf clubs, and private parties. The company also sells large quantities of discs and other related disc golf equipment to resalers and wholesalers around the world.\nDisc Golf Association's Mach 1 Disc Pole Hole disc golf basket was the first formal disc golf target to incorporate chains and a basket on a pole and became the Technical Standards used by the PDGA.\nDisc Golf Association (DGA) sponsors a disc golf team called Team DGA and various Disc Golf Tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe DGA was established by Ed Headrick in order to focus his attention on building and inventing equipment for the sport he founded. Ed Headrick coined and trademarked the term \"Disc Golf\" when formalizing the sport and invented the Disc Pole Hole (The Mach 1), the first disc golf target to incorporate chains and a basket on a pole.\nApart from establishing the Disc Golf Association (DGA), Headrick was the founding figure behind the International Frisbee Association (IFA) in 1967, as well as the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) and the Recreational Disc Golf Association (RDGA). He standardized both the regulations and the gear used in the sport. Ed open-sourced his trademark term \"Disc Golf\" and turned over control and administration of the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) to the growing body of disc golf players to run in 1983.\n\"Steady\" Ed Headrick, suffered two strokes while attending the 2002 Professional Disc Golf Association Amateur World Championships in Miami. He died in his sleep, August 12, 2002, at his home in La Selva Beach at the age of 78.\nAs per his wishes, his ashes were incorporated into a limited number of discs. The discs were given to friends and family and the limited remaining discs will be sold with all proceeds from the sales going to a nonprofit fund for the \"Steady\" Ed Memorial Disc Golf Museum at the PDGA International Disc Golf Center in Columbia County, Georgia."

        "title": "Super Bowl of Poker",
        "text": "The Super Bowl of Poker (also known as Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker or SBOP) was the second most prestigious poker tournament in the world during the 1980s. While the World Series of Poker (WSOP) was already drawing larger crowds as many amateurs sought it out, the SBOP \"was an affair limited almost exclusively to pros and hard-core amateurs.\"\nSix of the thirteen SBOP Main Events and many of the preliminary events were won by players eventually elected to the Poker Hall of Fame. Numerous events had several future members of the Hall sitting at the final table. For example, the competition at the final table of the included Poker Hall of Famers T. J. Cloutier, Chip Reese, Stu Ungar, Jack Keller, and 1992 WSOP Main Event winner Hamid Dastmalchi. But it was the event that may have had the toughest final three competitors ever. As of 2009, the final three competitors, all members of the Poker Hall of Fame, own a combined twenty-seven WSOP bracelets. Doyle Brunson, a ten-time WSOP bracelet winner, won this event. In order to win, he had to defeat seven time bracelet winner Billy Baxter and ten time bracelet winner Johnny Chan.\nIn addition to winning three WSOP Main Events, Stu Ungar was the only person to win the SBOP Main Event three times. Stu's first major poker tournament was at the 1980 SBOP. Four years later, having already won two WSOP Main Events, Stu's Main Event victory in 1984 helped establish the SBOP as a premier event while his back-to-back victories in 1988 and 1989, gave the SBOP a publicity boost as one of the premier poker tournaments. Prior to Stu's victory, the top professionals had encountered some difficulty at the SBOP. 1982 was noted for the poor performances of many of the game's top names. By the second break of the second day of the Main Event, all of the tournament favorites had been knocked out.\nHistory.\nPrior to 1979, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP. 1972 WSOP Main Event Champion and outspoken ambassador for poker, Amarillo Slim, saw this as an opportunity. \"The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament,\" he said. Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in February 1979. Slim modeled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event.\nWorld Poker Tour commentator Mike Sexton recalls that \"All the big players at the time were there. Amongst the big players [the SBOP] was very popular. They all went.\" While only 30 people participated in the inaugural event, six of them were future Poker Hall of Famers (Johnny Moss, Bobby Baldwin, Chip Reese, Amarillo Slim, Sailor Roberts and Doyle Brunson). It was held at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas, but because the Hilton closed its door to poker later that year, the tournament was forced to move to the Sahara in Reno the following year.\nAfter two years at the Sahara in Reno, the casino was acquired by the Hilton Corporation and the SBOP was forced to change its location again. Starting in 1982, the SBOP was held at the Sahara in Lake Tahoe. After a few years at the Sahara in Lake Tahoe, Slim moved the event to Caesar's in Lake Tahoe where it would be played for just one year. The location again changed to Caesar's in Las Vegas, where it would be held for several more years. When Caesar's closed its poker room in 1990, Slim took the best deal he could find. This took the tournament to a small casino the Flamingo Hilton in Laughlin, Nevada. Slim said that in order to get to the tournament, \"You had to fly to Vegas and rent a car and drive 125 miles, and that didn't go over real big.\" Only 12 people showed up for the 1991 SBOP Main Event. The lack of stability in the tournament's location has been cited as one of the reasons why the tournament ultimately failed.\nPrize.\nWhile the WSOP uses a flat model wherein there were a fairly large number of contestants making it \"in the money\", the SBOP used a top heavy formula where the top finishers walked away with a disproportionate share of the cash. For many of the events, the tournament only paid the top three finishers. As the SBOP grew, the number of winners increased, but the prize structure always remained top heavy. From 1985 to 1989, there were enough participants that the Main Event always paid at least the top seven players. Despite the top heavy pay-out structure, the WSOP Main Event always paid at least twice the amount as the SBOP Main Event during the same year.\nOne of the trademarks of the SBOP was the personalized gift from Amarillo Slim that the winner received. The first year, the gift was a $3,000 pair of customized cowboy boots, but as the tournament grew so too did the value of the gift. In 1980 a trophy was presented to the winners, with SBOP main event winner Gabe Kaplan describing it as \"a loving cup that was so enormous it made the gaudy gold bracelets given to the winners at the World Series of Poker look understated.\"\nNotes.\nThe number of entrants to the SBOP varies from source to source. Events marked with a \"ca.\" indicate events where the exact number is not known.\nThe location of the SBOP varies from source to source. The Hendon Mob records the location of all of the events as Caesar's Las Vegas. One of the legacies of the SBOP, however, was that it could not find a permanent home and kept moving. According to Amarillo Slim, the event was held at the Sahara in Lake Tahoe for several years before moving to Caesar's in Lake Tahoe. It only stayed at Caesar's Lake Tahoe for one year before moving to Caesar's Las Vegas."

During WSC many of the West Indian squad also played against the official Australian touring side, that did not feature WSC cricketers. Against in effect a second string Australia West Indies won the first two tests convincingly (by an innings in the first and nine wickets in the second). Only Alvin Kallicharran and Derick Parry played who were not signed to WSC. However, when the WSC cricketers were unavailable from the third test, the contests were more even. Australia won the third test (by three wickets), West Indies the fourth (by 198 runs), while the fifth was drawn."

The Earl of Chesterfield who had played for and against All England Eleven was the first President, George Henry Strutt was vice president and Walter Boden, who had campaigned for the club's foundation for three years, was secretary. When Chesterfield died in 1871, William Jervis, a well connected lawyer, became president. The main problem that arose from the beginning was that of arranging matches against other counties. For the first three seasons only Lancashire County Cricket Club were willing to make fixtures.\n1871 season.\nDerbyshire CCC played two matches in its first year, both against Lancashire CCC and joined the (then unofficial) County Championship. One match was won, and the other lost.\nThe club's first captain was Samuel Richardson, a gentleman's outfitter in the town of Derby. Derbyshire's bowling strength came from the professionals Dove Gregory who had played for a Derbyshire team in the 1850s, William Hickton a former Lancashire player and John Platts who was on the ground staff of MCC. Amateurs who began long careers with the club were Robert Smith (future captain) a farmer, John Smith a solicitor, Unwin Sowter a miller and baker, John Tilson a lace maker and John Burnham a clerk. Shorter careers were enjoyed by Thomas Attenborough a cattle dealer and Joseph Davidson a miner. Single appearances were made by Rev, Arthur Wilmot local rector, Edward Foley Oxford University student and vicar's son and James Billyeald a commercial traveller. Some had played for Gentlemen of Derbyshire, South Derbyshire and Derby Town.\nThe initial first-class match was at Old Trafford Cricket Ground on 26 and 27 May 1871. In this match the Lancashire batsmen were destroyed in their first innings by the pace of the Derbyshire fast bowler, Dove Gregory, who took six wickets for nine runs. They made a record low innings score of 25. Derbyshire replied with 147, and Lancashire failed in their second innings to achieve a combined total that surpassed it. In the return match in August, the club's first at the County Ground, Derbyshire replied with 80 to Lancashire's first innings score of 116, and with 58 to their second innings score of 84. Lancashire's Arthur Appleby did great damage with 6 for 38 and 7 for 21"

        "text": "The Shanghai Masters (, also known as Shanghai Rolex Masters for sponsorship reasons) is an annual tennis tournament for male professional players held in Shanghai, China. It is played on outdoor hard courts at the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena in the Minhang District, and is held in early October. The tournament is part of the nine ATP Tour Masters 1000 events on the ATP Tour, and is the only one not played in Europe or North America.\nThe tournament was not held from 2020 to 2022 due to Chinese travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOrganization.\nCompetition format.\nMatches in the singles and doubles main draws are played over eight days, from one Sunday to the next (in 2013, competition was held from October 6 to October 13, and this year competition will be held from October 11 to October 18). Qualifying matches for the singles main draw will be played in the weekend preceding the first complete week of competition (in 2012, on Saturday, October 5 and Sunday, October 6).\nThe singles main draw features 56 players (six rounds of play to the title for all competitors but the top 8 seeds), including 44 or 45 direct acceptances, 7 qualifiers, 4 wild cards, and 1 eventual special exempt. The singles qualifying draw features 28 players (two rounds of play to qualification for all competitors including the 14 seeds), with 24 direct acceptances, and 4 wild cards. The doubles draw, finally, features 24 teams (five rounds of play to the title for all competitors but the 8 seeded teams), including 22 direct acceptances (16 in advance, 6 on-site), and 2 wild cards.\nThe entry deadline for direct acceptance comes twenty-one days prior to the first Monday of the tournament week for the singles main and qualifying draws, and fourteen days prior to the first Monday of the tournament week, with six spots reserved for on-site entries, for the doubles draw. Players and teams on the acceptance list are sorted according to their position in the computerized ATP rankings in the week preceding competition, to enter the main draws, the qualifying draw (in singles) or to be kept as alternates (in doubles).\nThe singles and doubles draws are set first by selecting the eight seeds in both the singles and doubles competition, according to the most recent ATP rankings in the week preceding competition. After the seeds and byes are placed, the remaining players, including wild cards, qualifiers and special exempts (in singles) are placed in the rest of the draw, from top to bottom.\nAll singles matches are played in best-of-three tie-break sets format, while the doubles matches are played in two tie-break sets and a match tie-break, and use the no ad scoring system.\nPoints and prize money.\nAs an ATP Tour Masters 1000 event, the tournament distributes up to 1000 ATP rankings points to the singles and doubles champions. For the 2023 edition, a total of US$8,800,000 will be shared between the singles and doubles competitors. These are tables detailing the points and prize money allocation for each round of the 2023 Shanghai Masters:\nVenue.\nAll matches are played in outdoor conditions at the Qizhong Arena, after the venue held the Tennis Masters Cup indoors from 2005 to 2008. The surface is hard court, specifically DecoTurf.\nThe venue was originally built in 2004 and 2005 to host the Tennis Masters Cup, after the ATP awarded the tournament to Shanghai for a three-year contract (2005–2007), later extended to a fourth year. The site was conceived to become the largest tennis venue in Asia, with a 15,000-seats main stadium featuring a retractable roof of eight steel panels representing Shanghai's city flower, the magnolia. As of 2013, the Arena's Grand Stand Court 1 stands in fifth place in the list of tennis stadiums by capacity, alongside Beijing's National Tennis Stadium (built for the 2008 Summer Olympics) and Wimbledon's Centre Court.\nIn preparation of the first edition of the Shanghai Masters, the venue was expanded with several new stadiums and courts constructed by August 2009, including a Grand Stand Court 2, with a seating capacity of 5,000 spectators, and a Grand Stand Court 3, with a seating capacity of 3,000 spectators.\nHistory.\nThe Shanghai ATP Masters 1000 was established to fulfill the desire of the ATP World Tour and the Chinese Tennis Association to develop the market for tennis in China and Asia in general. In 2010 following a sponsorship deal the tournament was renamed the Shanghai Rolex Masters.\nIn 1996, a professional tournament was held for the first time in Shanghai, the largest city in China. The inaugural Shanghai Open was won by Russian Andrei Olhovskiy over Mark Knowles of the Bahamas. In 2002 the year-end championships, then called the Tennis Masters Cup. were held in the city. The success of the 2002 Tennis Masters Cup, won by World No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt from Australia, prompted the ATP, which had abandoned the idea of a touring Tennis Masters Cup, to award Shanghai the right to hold the tournament from 2005 to 2007.\nWhile the ATP International Series tournament of Shanghai was held two more years in 2003 and 2004 at the Shanghai New International Expo Center created for the 2002 Tennis Masters Cup, a new facility, the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena, was built to host the year-end championships starting from 2005. The ATP eventually extended the three-year deal to a fourth year in 2006, allowing the Tennis Masters Cup to increase its success in Shanghai. Over the four years spent at the Qizhong venue, the tournament saw Swiss World No. 1 Roger Federer reach three finals, losing the first in 2005 to Argentine David Nalbandian before winning the following two in 2006 and 2007, and Novak Djokovic of Serbia taking the 2008 title.\nIn March 2007, the ATP announced that their 2009 rebranding would also be the occasion to use the Qizhong facility and the Shanghai Tennis Masters Cup organisation to host an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in the city, the equivalent of what were then the ATP Masters Series. Shanghai was eventually given the October spot in the calendar, previously held by the Mutua Madrileña Masters Madrid indoor hard courts event, but was to be held as an outdoor hard surface tournament, thereby reducing the number of indoor Masters events to one, that being the Paris Masters. The new Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open moved to outdoor red clay courts during the spring European clay court season. The Tennis Masters Cup became the ATP World Tour Finals and moved to the O2 arena in London, United Kingdom.\nOrganized by Juss International Sports Event Management Company directed by Jiang Lan, the event was formally presented in a press conference on November 13, 2008, during the season's Tennis Masters Cup tournament, where the choice of the draw sizes, of the surface, and the building of additional courts were announced. Rolex, the Swiss watch company, was also revealed as the official sponsor of the event. The promotional campaign for the tournament started in early 2009, with the presentation of its slogan, \"Simply The Best\", and the event was officially launched on May 5, 2009. Expecting nearly 150,000 spectators during the tournament, the Shanghai Rolex Masters was introduced as the flagship of an Asian swing in the 2009 ATP World Tour calendar after the late September ATP World Tour 250 Thailand Open of Bangkok and Malaysian Open of Kuala Lumpur, and then early October ATP World Tour 500 Japan Open Tennis Championships of Tokyo and China Open of Beijing.\nPast finals.\nIn singles, Novak Djokovic (winner in 2012–13, 2015, and 2018) holds the record for most titles (four). Djokovic and Andy Murray share the records for most consecutive titles (two victories in a row each), and most finals (four). In doubles, Marcelo Melo (winner in 2013, 2015, and 2018) holds the record for most titles (three), and no player has collected back-to-back titles yet.\nRecords.\nSource: The Tennis Base\nSingles.\nLongest final\nShortest finals"

They are nocturnal animals and can be found in both tree canopies and on the ground.\nThis species should also not be confused with the cerrado mouse, \"Thalpomys cerradensis\", the cerrado red-nosed mouse, \"Wiedomys cerradensis\", or the cerrado grass mouse, \"Akodon serrensis\". The Atlantic Forest climbing mouse (\"Rhipidomys mastacalis\") has sometimes been similarly referred to as the \"long-tailed climbing mouse\". Rodents of genus \"Vandeleuria\" are also commonly known as long-tailed climbing mice.\nMorphology.\nCerrado climbing mice are medium-sized mice with a head-and-body length of with dull reddish gray-brown dorsal pelage. The underparts are white or pale cream, typically with gray bases to the hairs. The tail is slightly longer than head-and-body length, has a tuft of long hairs at the tip and is medium to dark reddish brown. The medium brown ears are large. The hindfeet are robust and moderately long; there is a sometimes ill-defined dark patch in the centre of the upper surface and the surrounding area is golden brown.\nEcology.\nThis mouse is found throughout most of the cerrado in gallery forest and semi-deciduous woodland. It is nocturnal and mainly arboreal, but also descends to the ground on occasion. It has been known to enter houses. Cerrado climbing mice are seed eaters."

His career is documented beginning in 1889 with the Montreal Victorias. Though his success would not be seen until near the end of his career. Between 1889 and 1894 he only won one game.

Robert was initially the starting goaltender for the Victorias though many other players would often challenge for this position in the early days of hockey. He would once again establish dominance as the team's starting goaltender in 1895.\nJones was given the opportunity to start a game with the Montreal Victorias after a string of two losses by the Victorias in 1895 by then goaltender Hartland MacDougall. Jones won the job again by going on a 4-game winning streak securing the Stanley Cup for the Montreal victorias for the first time. After losing the Stanley Cup to Winnipeg in 1896 he did not play again. Gordon Lewis would take over goaltending duties. Jones is known for winning a Stanley Cup.

Williams was first chosen for the Welsh squad as part of 1900 Home Nations Championship, playing in the opening game against England. Williams, along with Bob Thomas, were the two new caps brought into the forward positions for the game. Wales won the game 13-3, and Williams was reselected for the second game of the tournament, over Scotland. Wales beat Scotland, scoring four tries in the process, with Williams among the scorers, his first international points. The final game, away to Ireland, decided the Championship, and Wales took the Triple Crown with the only points coming from Swansea's George Davies.\nWilliams played just one more international game for Wales, the opener of the 1901 Championship, again against England. The game ended in another confident win for Wales, with Williams again on the score sheet with another try. The next match he was replaced by Hopkin Davies.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

This was the final day of the Games, and the top three finishers were presented their medals as part of the Closing Ceremony.\nThis is the first time in Olympic history that the 50 kilometre race is run as a mass start, where all skiers start at the same time, and the winner of the race is the first to cross the finish line. This is unlike the individual start, where skiers start one by one at 30-second intervals, and the winner is the skier whoever runs the distance the fastest.\nThe 50 kilometre had previously been skied only once as a mass start event at the World Championships, in 2005, with Frode Estil of Norway winning. However, that was in the classical style. The last 50 kilometre freestyle race at a World Championship was in 2003, and Martin Koukal of the Czech Republic won that event. Mikhail Ivanov of Russia was defending Olympic champion on 50 kilometre, but that event was held in classical technique with individual start. The last Olympic mass start race in 2002, won by Christian Hoffmann of Austria, was a shorter 30 kilometre event.\nWith a pack of 10–15 skiers coming together towards the finish, Giorgio Di Centa won Italy's second gold medal in cross-country skiing. This was the closest Olympic 50 km ever (0.8 seconds), eclipsing the 4.9 seconds that separated Thomas Wassberg from Gunde Svan (both from Sweden) at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.\nA photograph of Di Centa in action during this event would be used as the pictogram for the cross-country skiing events at the following Olympics.\nResults.\nThe race was a 'mass start', with all 79 skiers starting at the same time. 13 skiers failed to finish the race, while 3 were originally entered, but did not start."

The defending World Champions were Norway, with a team of Odd-Bjørn Hjelmeset, Frode Estil, Lars Berger and Tore Ruud Hofstad. The Norwegians were also the defending Olympic champion, with Anders Aukland, Estil, Kristen Skjeldal and Thomas Alsgaard winning gold in Salt Lake. At Nagano in 1998, the Norwegians beat the Italians by less than one tenth of a second, and in 1994 at Lillehammer the Italians beat the Norwegians by less than one tenth of a second. In the previous three Olympics, the winning team beat the silver medalists by a cumulative time of just under one tenth of a second. One further relay event was held before the Olympics, at Val di Fiemme on 15 January 2006, which was won by an Italian team consisting of Giorgio Di Centa, Valerio Checchi, Pietro Piller Cottrer and Cristian Zorzi. Four teams finished within 2.6 seconds of the Italian winners.\nHosts Italy won this relay, their fifth straight medal in relays in the Winter Olympics. They were over 15 seconds ahead of any competitors. Sweden took bronze, their first medal since 1988, and Norway failed to win a medal for the first time since 1988.\nResults.\nEach team used four skiers, with each completing racing over the same 10 kilometre circuit. The first two raced in the classical style, and the final pair of skiers raced freestyle. The Austrian team was disqualified after the IOC declared all four members permanently ineligible for doping-related violations. This had a minimal effect on the final standings, as the Austrian team had been lapped during the race, ending up last overall.\nThe race was started at 10:00."

        "title": "Sweep rowing",
        "text": "Sweep rowing is one of two disciplines of the sport of rowing. In sweep rowing each rower has one oar, usually held with both hands. As each rower has only one oar, the rowers have to be paired so that there are equal numbers of oars on each side of the boat. In the United Kingdom, rowing generally refers to sweep rowing only. The term pulling was also used historically. In the other rowing discipline, sculling, each rower holds two oars, one in each hand.\nSweep or single oar rowing has a long history and was the means of propulsion for Greek triremes and Viking longboats. These boats were wide enough for the pairs of rowers to sit alongside each other. Boats can go faster, the narrower they are, because a smaller cross-sectional area reduces drag and wave drag and gives a sharper angle to the bow. The hulls can be kept narrower by attaching riggers to the gunwales, so that the oarlocks can be placed farther out to carry longer oars. A narrower hull means the rowers cannot sit side by side and so they sit one behind another. The riggers are placed alternately along the boat so that the forces are approximately equal to each side of the boat, but they are nevertheless asymmetrical. This means a sweep oared racing shell has to be stiffer in order to handle the unmatched forces, and so requires more bracing, which means it has to be heavier and slower than an equivalent sculling boat.\nSweep rowing has to be done with crews in multiples of two: pairs, fours and eights (sixes and boats longer than eight are not used in competitive racing today). Each rower in a sweep boat is on either stroke side (port) or bow side (starboard), according to which side of the boat the rower's oar extends from. In a sculling boat the oars and riggers apply forces symmetrically to the shell. While sculling boats are also in multiples of two, it is possible to have a single scull or triple scull.\nThe primary sweep oar racing boats are as follows."

He was chosen for the final game of the 1896 Home Nations Championship, against Ireland; one of only two new caps to be brought into the Welsh team along with Llewellyn Lloyd.

This was the beginning of the First Golden Age of Welsh rugby, and Miller was part of the team that won all three of the 1900 Championship games to lift the Triple Crown. Miller played in all three matches, and did enough to secure his reselection for the entire 1901 Home Nations Championship.

With the score at 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7), 7–6(3), 59–59, the match was suspended due to failing daylight for the second straight day, after a total of 9 hours and 58 minutes of play. Isner had already served a world record 98 aces by that time, with Mahut scoring 94 aces, both breaking Ivo Karlović's previous record of 78. The second day's play alone totalled 7 hours and 8 minutes, more than the longest previous complete match, therefore also making it the longest session of tennis ever played in a single day. Isner eventually defeated Mahut 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7), 7–6(3), 70–68. The match lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes in total, and the fifth set alone lasted 8 hours and 11 minutes.\nThe match has been noted as officially the longest match ever in a tennis Open in terms of both times and games, beating the previous records set (respectively) by the match between Frenchmen Fabrice Santoro and Arnaud Clément at the 2004 French Open, which lasted for 6 hours and 33 minutes, and the first round match at Wimbledon in 1969 where Pancho Gonzales defeated Charlie Pasarell in 112 games (before the introduction of the tie-break). \"Time\" magazine named the Isner–Mahut match one of the Top 10 Sports Moments of 2010.\nQueen visits Wimbledon.\nQueen Elizabeth II visited Wimbledon on Thursday 24 June, her first visit to the annual tennis tournament in 33 years. The last time the Queen had attended the championships was in 1977, when she watched British player Virginia Wade win the ladies' singles title. Arriving shortly after 11 am, the Queen's visit included a tour of the grounds and an observation session of the All England Club's Wimbledon Junior Tennis Initiative on Court 14, before moving to the Members' Lawn where she greeted a line-up of players: the defending champions in singles Serena Williams and Roger Federer, multiple-time Wimbledon champions Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Venus Williams, and a selection of top professionals: Caroline Wozniacki, Jelena Janković, Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick. She also met four British women's tennis players: Heather Watson, Elena Baltacha, Anne Keothavong and Laura Robson. Following that, she walked across the bridge to Centre Court, where she later had lunch in the Clubhouse with a selection of former and current tennis players.\nThe Queen finished her visit by watching Britain's fourth seed Andy Murray play Jarkko Nieminen on Centre Court, from the Royal Box. Before and after the match, Murray and Nieminen bowed to the Royal Box, a tradition that had previously not been in use since 2003.\nRecords.\nIn addition to all the records set during the match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut, the following records were also established:\nSingles seeds.\nThe following are the seeded players and notable players who withdrew from the event.

The right-hander worked in 11 games, including two starting assignments, for the Milwaukee Braves in 1962 and 1964. Nicknamed \"Slewfoot,\" he was born in Dallas, Georgia, stood tall and weighed .\nButler's professional baseball career lasted for nine seasons (1957–65), all in the Braves' organization. He won a spot on the 1962 Milwaukee roster out of spring training and in his second MLB appearance, he worked 4 innings of three-hit relief on April 28 against the newly formed Houston Colt .45s at Colt Stadium. His scoreless effort netted him his first big-league win, as the Braves rallied from a 3–2 deficit to come back and prevail, 9–3. Fifteen days later, he started against the National League's other expansion team, the New York Mets, at the Polo Grounds, and threw a six-hit, complete game victory, 3–2.\nBut after another start on May 19, he suffered a severe elbow injury, and was very slow to recover. Butler made two appearances with the Braves over the final four months of 1962, spent 1963 in the minor leagues, and then got into two more games for Milwaukee in July 1964, but was ineffective. He retired after the 1965 season due to his injury.\nIn his 11 MLB games, Butler allowed 33 hits and nine bases on balls in 35 innings pitched, with 24 strikeouts. He finished with a 2–0 record and a 3.31 earned run average.\nButler died at his home on October 2, 2019, in Dallas, Georgia."

        "title": "Rugby union in Guatemala",
        "text": "Rugby union in Guatemala is a minor, but growing sport.\nThe governing body is the Union de Rugby de Guatemala, which is not affiliated with World Rugby.\nHistory.\n2006–2008.\nThe first documented game of rugby union in Guatemala was in 2006, although it may have been played much earlier. The game was between the Jules Verne School in Guatemala and Liceo Francés from Costa Rica.\nThe first rugby team was founded April 2007 in Quetzaltenango (\"Xela\"), the second-largest city in Guatemala. Xela Rugby Football Club (\"XRFC\") was founded in January 2007 by Joshua Macy, an American who at the time was principal at a local school, and Pedro Hecht, a Guatemalan national; together they started XRFC, expanding the sport within the city, and later the rest of the country. A few months later graduates of \"Escuela Internacional de Educación Física y Deporte de Cuba\" and residents of Guatemala City (\"Guate\") with the support of expatriates began rugby training thanks to Macy's and Hecht's efforts by sending balls and other equipment to Guatemala City. News of training quickly spread and a team was established in Guate on September 15, 2007. Nilton Noriega, the main organizer of rugby in Guate, and Macy of XRFC were able to make contact.\nThe difficulty of finding basic training equipment in the country was soon evident. The team in Guatemala City only had an American football and a late 1970s rugby ball for training. The team from Xela, which at that time was better organized, sent the first modern rugby balls to Guatemala City by public transportation in support of the new team.\nDue to the Guatemala City team's location and contacts they were tasked to organize the first Guatemalan Rugby Union inter-club game. The event was scheduled to take place October 20, 2007, in Xela. The Guatemala City team, needing an official name before the match, chose to be called the Jaguares by majority vote. The Jaguares won this first game by a score of 17 to 13. The game was covered by the local newspaper \"El Quezalteco\". A rematch was scheduled for November 11, 2007.\nBetween the first and second matches Nilton Noriega was contacted by Ramón Colé and members of the Costa Rica Rugby Union. Costa Rica having noticed the growth of rugby in their neighboring nations (Guatemala and Panamá) decided to host the first Central American Tournament “Tri-Nations Cup” on December 15, 2007, and extended an invitation to Guatemala. The Jaguares and XRFC met, agreed on selecting a national team and accepted the invitation.\nThe second rugby game in Guatemala's history took place at Estadio Central del Parque La Democracia on November 11, 2007, in Guatemala City. “Jaguares” won, 21–7. Two major changes happened that day: first the naming of the first national squad as the “Jaguares”, Guatemala City team giving away their name and then choosing by simple vote to be known as “Guatemala Rugby Club” (\"GRC\"), and the Guatemala Ministry of Sports was contacted to begin formalizing the first national rugby league in Guatemala.\nIn December, 2007, Guatemala participated in the First Central American Rugby cup. The other competing teams were Panama and the Costa Rica A and B sides. Costa Rica A came first in this tournament, Guatemala captained by Josh Macy came in 2nd, Panama 3rd, and Costa Rica B 4th.\nIn February 2008 the need for more rugby teams in Guatemala and ideological differences found the departure of players from GRC to create three separate teams. These teams came to be Guatemala Rugby Club, Antigua Rugby Club and Santa Rosa Rugby Club. This brought the total number of club teams in Guatemala to four. The first inter-club tournament was between these teams used a single game elimination structure and was named \"Torneo Apertura\". The tournament was won by GRC followed by Xela RFC, Santa Rosa and Antigua RC.\nWith a solid rugby foundation in place Guatemala was better prepared for the 2008 Central American Tri Nations Cup hosted by Costa Rica. Guatemala, again voting Josh Macy as captain, were victorious over the Costa Rica National Team, securing second place with first place taken by a Venezuelan select \"30+\" team. Panama did not participate.\n2009–present.\nThe 2009 Guatemalan inter-club tournament was once again won by Guatemala Rugby Club with Xela RFC taking 3rd place. Antigua was unable to support a team in 2009 and were replaced by the first rugby team in El Salvador \"Torogoces\" which took 2nd place in their debut tournament. Rugby 7s made its tournament debut in Guatemala in 2009 as well. The “Copa República Argentina 7's A-side” sponsored by the Argentine Embassy and Consulate was organized by Santa Rosa RC with teams from: Mexico (Tazmania “A” and “B”), “Red Devils” from Panama, ”Bocaracas” from Costa Rica, Guatemala Rugby Club, Santa Rosa Rugby Club, Xela RFC and a barbarians team participating. Tazmania “A” from Mexico took 1st place, Panama \"Red Devils\" 2nd, Guatemala Rugby Club taking 3rd place.\nIn January 2010 the rugby community gathered for the premiere of Invictus to further promote rugby in Guatemala.\nAgain ideological differences from within GRC ended with the formation of a new team. Several members of GRC left to form Guatemala Quetzal Rugby Club (\"GQRC\"). GRC filed a complaint with league organizers to have Guatemala Quetzal Rugby Club removed from the tournament for using the country's name \"Guatemala\" citing that it would cause confusion between prospective players attempting to join GRC. The Quetzales were allowed to play as guests and were undefeated during the 2010 season and secured first place with El Salvador Torogoces \"A\" in second and GRC in 3rd.\nGuatemala did not participate in any international tournaments in 2010.\nIn 2011 GRC again filed a complaint with league officials regarding the use of \"Guatemala\" by another club. GRC has since formally dropped all complaints."

        "text": "The United Arab Emirates Rugby League team (nicknamed The Falcons) represented the United Arab Emirates in the sport of rugby league football.\nHistory.\nThe sport of rugby league enjoyed a surge in popularity surrounding the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. As a result, a number of new nations took up the sport. The UAE was an early participant in this trend, playing their first international match in March 2008.\nLacking an established rugby league tradition in the Emirates, the Falcons were initially made up a mixture of natives and expatriates from England, South Africa and other Commonwealth countries. Most notable amongst these was Wayne McDonald, former captain of the Scotland national team and player in the Super League in Europe.\nFrom November 2007, Sol Mokdad was the Director of Development of the Emirates Rugby League. \nSol Mokdad arrest.\nIn 2015, it was announced that UAE Rugby League was planning a bid to host the 2021 Rugby League World Cup. The organization also secured a sponsorship with Nissan for the fledgling four-team UAE Rugby League Cup. On April 23, 2015, it was announced that the competition had been ordered to drop all references to \"UAE Rugby\" at the behest of the UAE Rugby Federation, who, as the recognized body for rugby union, claimed sovereignty over all variations and designations of \"rugby\" in the UAE - UAE Rugby League was subsequently renamed \"Rugby League Commission\".\nOn May 8, 2015, it was announced that Mokdad had been arrested at the behest of UAE Rugby Federation authorities for “unauthorised representation of the UAE sovereignty”. It was also alleged by the UAE Rugby Federation that Mokdad was an illegal immigrant.\nThe RLIF responded by meeting with UAE government officials in order to attempt to clarify the status of rugby league as a distinct sport from rugby union and to end the legal proceedings against Mokdad.\nOn May 20, Mokdad was released from prison and the charges brought by the UAERF dropped on the condition that he signed a document stating that he would have no future involvement in the administration of rugby league. In the meantime, the UAERF claimed ownership of rugby league and organized a rearranged date for the final of the Rugby League Cup, but the two finalists (Abu Dhabi Harlequins and Xodus Wasps) declined to participate, forcing the cancellation of the competition. On May 25, Mokdad was forced by the UAERF to issue a public statement relinquishing control of the sport to them and apologising and admitting his 'guilt' in organising a rugby league competition. UAE's affiliate membership of the Rugby League European Federation was cancelled on the same day.\nInternational Results.\nThe Falcons' first international series was a three-match series against the Liban Espoir, the Lebanese domestic representative team, in 2009. The first match of the series ended early, after an on-field brawl prompted the referee to call the game off after 56 minutes of play.\n2009 Liban Espoir Series\n2012 Tariq Niazi Cup"

Also that year, UAERL announced the formation of the country's first junior international sides, which were to be coached by Apollo Perelini.\nIn April 2015 the Rugby League was forced to change its name to remove all references to the United Arab Emirates following threats from the UAE Rugby Federation, and was disbanded altogether following Mokdad's arrest at the behest of rugby union officials in May 2015."

        "text": "The England cricket team visited Ireland in 2009 to play one One Day International (ODI) as a warm-up for the ODI series against Australia.\nOnly ODI.\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat, but only added two runs before losing Ravi Bopara for a duck in the third over. Debutant Jonathan Trott then followed two overs later without troubling the scorers. Fellow debutant Joe Denly and wicket-keeper Matt Prior struck up a good partnership for the third wicket, adding 53 runs, but Prior was tempted into a big shot by Andre Botha and caught at long leg by Regan West. By the half-way stage of the innings, England were only on 73/3, far below the typical scoring rate for an ODI. Paul Collingwood was the next to fall, hitting the ball skywards as he attempted a big shot off West, and Owais Shah followed suit soon after, caught at cover while attempting a slog. Meanwhile, Denly had reached his maiden ODI half-century off 89 balls to take England past the 100-run mark, but he was out for 67 in the 39th over. Luke Wright then came in and picked up the baton dropped by Denly, making a quick-fire 36 runs off 26 deliveries before becoming Trent Johnston's fourth wicket of the innings. The England tail added another 26 runs for two more wickets to finish the innings at 203/9.\nA prolonged spell of rain during the interval meant that play did not resume until 17:30, and Ireland's innings had to be reduced to 20 overs, with a revised target of 116 runs. Tim Bresnan struck first for England, removing Ireland captain William Porterfield and wicket-keeper Niall O'Brien with almost identical dismissals, both batsmen cutting to Paul Collingwood at point. The next two wickets fell to spin as Graeme Swann trapped Andre Botha LBW for 15 before Adil Rashid caught-and-bowled Ireland's top scorer, Paul Stirling, for 30 runs. Five wickets then fell in four overs to leave Ireland at 94/9 with just two overs left to play. Trent Johnston hit 21 runs off 15 balls but his effort was not enough to secure the win for Ireland as they fell two runs short."

        "title": "2009 World Series of Poker Europe",
        "text": "The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants have had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas.\nIn 2004, Harrah's Casinos purchased the rights to the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area: Fifty, Leicester Square, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a \"style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be surprised if we require participants to wear blazers at the tables. If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe.\"\nIn marketing the WSOPE, Harrah's Casino did not rely upon the reputation of Harrah's or the WSOP alone. On 5 July 2007, Harrah's announced its alliance with England-based Betfair, one of the largest online gaming companies in the world. The agreement, the largest-ever union of an online and offline gaming company, is intended to build on Betfair's European reputation in advertising the WSOPE. Due to changes in U.S. laws, effective in 2007, the WSOP could no longer accept money from online gambling companies. This prevented the WSOP from acknowledging WSOP qualifiers from online events. The WSOPE is not bound by this limitation. The United Kingdom Gambling Act of 2005 allows for legal regulated online poker sites. Furthermore, as the laws that govern the age of gambling differ in England than the U.S., the WSOPE admits younger players. In 2007, one of these younger players, 18-year-old Annette \"Annette_15\" Obrestad became the youngest player to win a WSOP bracelet event.\nThe third WSOPE took place between 17 September and 1 October 2009. It consisted of four events held at the Casino at the Empire in Leicester Square, London. The first event saw J.P. Kelly emerge as the winner of a less-than-an-hour long heads up battle, overcoming a 3-to-1 chip deficit against Fabien Dunlop and earning his second World Series of Poker bracelet of the year. Kelly won most of his final chip stack in a flush-over-flush situation, leaving Dunlop with only 1% of chips in play. In the second event, Erik Cajelais easily defeated runner-up Mats Gavatin after entering the heads up phase with an almost 6-to-1 chip lead. The third event saw Finnish Full Tilt Poker pro Jani Vilmunen defeat Howard Lederer, the owner of Full Tilt brand, over the course of a 90-minute-long match with nearly even stacks. The Main Event featured a heated battle between Barry Shulman and Daniel Negreanu that lasted over five hours before Shulman eventually eliminated Negreanu by hitting a three-of-a-kind on the river. However, even in second place, Negreanu still topped the All Time Money List, the list of WSOP players ranked by total winnings."

Moore was a Center for the UConn Huskies from 2000 to 2005.\nHigh school.\nMoore was introduced to basketball at the age of 10 by her older brother. By the time Moore reached Colony High School in Palmer, Alaska, she was a good all-around athlete. She was on the basketball, track and volleyball teams. The basketball team reached the state finals four times winning the State Championship twice, and the volleyball team also won two State Championships. Jessica was voted Alaska's Athlete Of The Year her junior and senior high school years. Her most memorable experience from high school was winning her first of two State Championships in 1998.\nAAU.\nMoore got recognition from an Athletic Amateur Union (AAU) in Oregon. The coach spoke to Jessica's high school coach, inviting her to play for his team during the second half of the summer. This team traveled all around the country, offering her great exposure. During her sophomore, junior and senior summers, she spent half of it with her Alaska team, and half playing, and living in Oregon.\nCollege.\nMoore narrowed her college choices down to four – University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Oregon, University of Connecticut and Ohio State University. She chose the University of Connecticut because of the family atmosphere and the high possibility of winning a National Championship. Once she picked a school she had to decide if she would play both volleyball and basketball or just pick one. She picked basketball to focus on. The basketball team was already stacked with post players so Jessica wasn't going to get much playing time as a freshman. She was a medical red shirted player her first year gaining an extra year of eligibility. It all paid off, the Huskies won three National Championships in Jessica's years at Connecticut. However it would not come without some hardship. During the championship game (the 3rd Championship) Moore suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in the second half of the game. She remained in the game finishing with 14 points, and nine rebounds despite the injury that would require surgery. In May 2005, Moore earned her bachelor's degree in political science.\nUSA Basketball.\nMoore was named to the USA Women's U19 team which represented the US in the 2001 U19 World's Championship, held in Brno, Czech Republic in July 2001. Moore scored 6.4 points per game, and helped the USA team to a 6–1 record and the bronze medal. She was the third leading rebounder on the team averaging 5.3 per game.\nWNBA.\nMoore was selected number 24 by the Charlotte Sting in the 2005 WNBA draft. The team struggled and then made some roster changes. She was cut but not without notice from other league teams. Two days later she was picked up by the Los Angeles Sparks where she enjoyed a winning team making it to the WNBA playoffs. In the WNBA off-season she went over to Europe to play basketball. She played in Spain for Universitario de Ferrol, and the next year she played in France for Challes Les Eux.\nIn 2011, Moore was waived by the Indiana Fever, but picked up by the Connecticut Sun. She played in the WNBA for a total of 8 seasons.\nHuskies of Honor induction.\nOn December 29, 2013, the University of Connecticut inducted two women's basketball teams into the Huskies of Honor: the National Championship winning teams of 2002–03 and 2003–04. Moore was a player for each of those two seasons."

        "text": "Michael Wolf (born January 24, 1981) is a German former professional ice hockey forward who played with the Iserlohn Roosters and EHC München in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).\nPlaying career.\nWolf began his hockey career with EV Füssen. He spent his junior career there, before earning a spot on the professional roster in 1998 as a 17-year-old. Wolf went on to play two more years in Füssen and moved up with his team to the Oberliga in 2000. In 2001 Wolf signed with SC Bietigheim-Bissingen in the 2nd Bundesliga. He established as a solid scorer over three years. In 2004 Wolf signed with the Essen Mosquitoes. With a breakthrough performance he led all German players in scoring at the end of the season, with many clubs from the Deutsche Eishockey Liga competing to sign him to their roster.\nWolf eventually signed a contract with the Iserlohn Roosters over one year with a club option to extend it for one year. At the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Wolf showed his goal scoring instinct and was competing for the top scoring position. In October 2005 he scored his first DEL-hat-trick against the current champions at the time, Eisbären Berlin. He was named DEL Rookie of the Year and the Roosters extended his contract for two years. For the next season Robert Hock, the highest German scoring player the previous season, came to Iserlohn. Roosters coach Geoff Ward put them together with David Sulkovsky and the three formed the most dangerous native line in the DEL. Nevertheless, Iserlohn missed the playoffs again.\nIn the 2007–08 season Wolf and Hock went on to dominate the league in all offensive categories. Wolf was leading the league in goals and powerplay goals, while Hock was leading in points, assists and powerplay assists. Canadian players like Brad Tapper, Pat Kavanagh, Tyler Beechey, Jimmy Roy, Ryan Ready, and Bob Wren also performed unexpectedly well, so that the Roosters finished fifth in the league and Iserlohn reached their first playoffs in almost 20 years. In game 2 of the quarterfinal series against the Frankfurt Lions, Wolf scored the game-winning goal in the third overtime. The game was the longest in German hockey history. After the Roosters were defeated by Frankfurt Wolf was named DEL MVP, best native player, and best winger.\nAfter an impressive season performance, and despite other DEL interest he re-signed for two more years with the Roosters. Wolf was quoted that \"money is not all\" and expressed his desire to stay in this great organisation. The next year Iserlohn struggled, and missed the playoffs. Nevertheless, \"Hand und Handschuh\" (hand and glove; the nickname of Wolf and Hock given by coach Rick Adduono for being a highly skilled duo) won the scoring title (Hock) and finished second in goals (Wolf). On December 8, 2009, Wolf re-signed with the Roosters to a two-year contract extension.\nWolf played with the Roosters for nine seasons, before leaving the club on June 2, 2014, to sign a multi-year contract with fellow DEL competitors, EHC München.\nIn the 2018–19 season, Wolf scored 24 points in 33 regular season games, helping Red Bull return to the Finals for the fourth consecutive year with 4 points in 18 games. After a finals defeat to Adler Mannheim, Wolf concluded his professional playing career."

        "title": "World Series Cricket results",
        "text": "World Series Cricket results are the results of the main games played in the now defunct World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. World Series Cricket was a break away professional cricket competition staged between 1977 and 1979, organized by Kerry Packer for his Australian television network, the Nine Network. The matches ran in opposition to established international cricket. World Series Cricket drastically changed the nature of cricket, and its influence continues to be felt today.The intention for creating World Series Cricket is not to offer the media and broadcasting rights by the Australian cricket board to him and after few years when board agreed to give broadcast rights to kerry packers then he no more interested to run the world series cricket and this how IPL started in India with the same thought and mindset.\nWSC involved a three-way competition between the WSC Australia XI, WSC West Indies XI, and WSC World XI, a team composed of players from the other cricketing nations, although a number of West Indian players also played in the World team when they were not playing for the West Indies. Towards the end of the competition a fourth team named the Cavaliers was added for the Country Cavaliers Tour. It was composed of players not selected by the other three sides for that rounds' fixtures; this was a way of making better use of all the players contracted to the competition.\nOrigin.\nThe series originated due to two main factors—the widespread view that players were not paid sufficient amounts to make a living from cricket, and that Packer wished to secure the exclusive broadcasting rights to Australian cricket, then held by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). After the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) refused to accept Channel Nine's bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976, Packer set up his own series by secretly signing agreements with leading players from the national cricket teams of Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies.\nOfficial cricket won a series of minor victories. WSC was unable to call the Australian team \"Australia\", or use the official rules of cricket, which are copyright of the MCC. The Australian team therefore became \"WSC Australia XI\", and former Australian captain and leading commentator Richie Benaud took the job of writing rules and playing conditions for the series. WSC was also shut out of traditional cricket venues, so Packer leased two Australian football stadiums, VFL Park in Melbourne and Football Park in Adelaide, a trotting track in Perth, Gloucester Park, and the Sydney Showground.\n1977–78.\nAnother of the victories of official cricket was to ban WSC from using the term \"Test match\". The five-day matches were therefore retitled \"Supertests\" in WSC.\nSupertests.\nThe Supertests for the 1977–78 season were five-day matches. Two separate series were played, WSC West Indies XI vs WSC Australia XI, and World XI vs WSC Australia XI.\nWSC West Indies XI vs WSC Australia XI.\nWSC West Indies XI won the series 2–1.\nWSC World XI vs WSC Australia XI.\nWSC World XI won the series 2–1.\nInternational Cup.\nThe International Cup consisted of one-day limited overs matches, with both sides allocated forty overs of eight balls each. Two points were awarded for a win, one for a no result or abandonment. If points were level, combined run rate would determine position. The two top two sides contested the first semi-final. The winner of that match progressed to the final, while the loser played the bottom side in the second semi-final for the other place in the final. The final was a one-off winner-takes-all match.\n1st Semi-Final\n2nd Semi-Final\nFinal\n1978–79.\nSupertests.\nFor the 1978–79 season the Supertest format was changed to a round-robin format, with the top team going to the final, and the other two teams playing-off in a semi-final. The Supertests were also changed from the traditional five-day Test match format to four-day day–night matches.\nBy winning both matches the WSC World XI qualified for the final. A semi-final between WSC Australia and WSC West Indies determined the other finalist.\nSemi-Final\nFinal\nInternational Cup.\nFor the 1978–79 season the limited overs International Cup saw both sides allocated fifty overs of six balls each. Two points were assigned for a win, one for a no result. If teams were level on points, combined run-rate would be used to separate them. The top two teams would contest a best-of-four final series.\nA crowd of 44,377 attended the first match of the 1978–79 International Cup, under the new floodlights at the SCG.\nFinals\nWSC West Indies XI won the finals 3–1.\n1979 tour to the West Indies.\nIn 1979, following the tour of New Zealand, the WSC Australians team set off for a more extensive tour to the Caribbean that would encompass five Supertest games and twelve one-day games against the WSC West Indies.\nSupertests.\nFor this series the Supertests reverted to a traditional five-day format.\nDrawn series 1–1."

The purpose of these holes is to reduce the surface area of the blade so that sticky foods do not cling to it. Most skeleton knives are used for cutting very soft foods.\nThe knife was created by a Swiss restaurant and after its creation and advertisement it was stolen by many cutlery companies and private manufacturers, and is now widely manufactured by companies like Victorinox.\nPenknife.\nThe less commonly known type of skeleton knife is a penknife that was made without bolsters or handle material and sold to jewelers or other artisans for final finishing.\nThese types of knives were mostly made in the 19th century and as late as 1950. Wostenholm of Sheffield, England made many of these knives as did Imperial Knife Co. in the United States. Jewelers would finish the knives' handles in semi precious stones and in some cases gold or other precious metals in their own style."

        "text": "Rugby union is a popular sport in Tokelau.\nHistory.\nLike many other Pacific nations, Tokelauan rugby is a popular, but often not formally organised sport. Tokelauans due to their small numbers, and scattered island population, have often preferred rugby sevens to the XV game, although Tokelau did play rugby 15s at the 1983 South Pacific Games, including a creditable 15–28 loss to , a much larger Pacific nation. Rugby sevens has been a sport in the South Pacific Games since the late 1990s.\nThere is also a semi-formal league structure.\nTokelau's main problems are related to population and geographical factors - its population is a mere 1,416, and lives on three widely separated tropical coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean. All of this makes a rugby infrastructure difficult to construct, and the islands are beset by rising sea levels. The geographic future of Tokelau depends on the height of the ocean. No significant land is more than two metres above high water of ordinary tides. This means Tokelau is particularly vulnerable to any possible sea level rises caused by global warming. There is also a lack of land for specifically designated rugby pitches.\nTokelau's close relationship with New Zealand and Australia, however, ensures that rugby union gets a lot of media coverage in Tokelau.\nTokelau took part in a rugby sevens tournament in the Cook Islands in June 2009.\nRugby league comparison.\nAs is the case with most Pacific Islands, rugby league has had a presence in Tokelau since the late 1980s. However, like some other national rugby league teams, the national side has relied on Australian based players with Tokelauan heritage to bolster its strength."

        "text": "Rugby union is played in Tuvalu. Unlike most South Pacific islands, rugby union is largely played on an informal basis. alongside association football, which is the main sport played by Tuvaluans.\nThe Tuvalu Rugby Union, an organising body for Rugby Union, was established in 2007 with the intention of forming a national team. Rugby sevens was first introduced to Tuvalu in 2007.\nHistory.\nRugby is played at the two secondary schools; Fetuvalu Secondary School, a day school located on Funafuti, and Motufoua Secondary School, a boarding school located on Vaitupu. They have their own internal tournaments.\nThe club level rugby competition has eight clubs, all based on the main island of Funafuti. However all teams attract supporters based on the home island of the team members, such as the 'Niutao Sharks'. The Tuvalu Sports Ground is shared with the association football competition. Training activities are also carried out on the Funafuti International Airport, which is a shared facility, used for sport and recreational activities.\nThe Tuvalu Rugby Union also selects a national team. Tuvalu participated in the Rugby Sevens competition in the XIVth Pacific Games in 2011. It is also a featured sport at the Tuvalu Games.\nTuvalu's main problems are geographical - its population of 11,992 makes it the third-least-populated independent country in the world, with only Vatican City and Nauru having fewer inhabitants. It is also one of the smallest member by population of the United Nations. In terms of physical land size, at just Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City—0.44 km2; Monaco—1.95 km2 and Nauru—21 km2. It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls. All of this makes a rugby infrastructure difficult to construct.\nTuvalu's close relationship with New Zealand and Australia, however, ensures that rugby union gets a lot of media coverage in Tuvalu."

Wallis and Futuna is still a French colony, and this has proven a mixed blessing, as players have the prospect of \"promotion\" to French professionalism/semi-amateurism, but this also potentially weakens the local system, removing players from local competitions.\nWallis and Futuna also has geographical problems. The two main island groups are 160 km apart, making regular competition difficult. There is also the issue of population, since the islands only have around 13,000 inhabitants. However, the islands have strong ties to Tonga and Samoa, both of which are major rugby nations, despite their small size. The \"Kailao\" often thought of as the Tongan \"haka\" and used by the Tonga national rugby union team is of Wallisian origin.\nPacific Games.\nWallis and Futuna first played international 15-a-side rugby in 1966 at the South Pacific Games (as it was then called), but has since switched focus onto playing rugby sevens. Rugby Sevens has been a sport in the South Pacific Games since the late 1990s. The Wallis and Futuna team has competed at 7-a-side rugby tournaments in recent Pacific Games."

However, rugby can be found in almost all the South American nations, partly because of massive immigration from Europe, notably the British Isles and France. Rugby was also introduced to some regions of the continent by the Irish Marist Brothers and their schools.\nHowever, Bolivian rugby was not really established from these waves of European immigration in the 19th and early 20th century, but during the late 20th century. The impetus came partly through large numbers of foreign nationals working for various countries, but most especially people from Argentina. It has been claimed for example that British workers connected with the mines were playing in the mid 20th century.\nThe confirmed roots of Bolivian rugby go back to the 1960s, when José Pipo Viale, from Córdoba, Argentina introduced the game to Cochabamba. As in Paraguay, the French have been instrumental in expanding the game. French diplomats from the Embassy, and the \nColegio Franco Boliviano produced a team which managed to tour Chile, and played an informal match against a French Guiana side touring South America.\nTraditionally rugby is most popular in La Paz, the capital, but it is also fairly successful in the Santa Cruz region, and is played by some university sides. There are also clubs in Cochabamba and Tarija.\nThe interest in Santa Cruz was partially the result of a community of Argentine expatriates, who formed a club with the locals. The first Santa Cruz team was Jenecheru.\nThe first Bolivian Club Championship was in 2006.\nTouring sides occasionally visit from neighbouring countries."

        "text": "Rugby union was first introduced into Lebanon both by the mandated French forces, and subsequently by the Lebanese returning from the diaspora. Introduced into other parts of the Middle East, by the British military in the mid 20th Century, rugby has begun to develop across the Arabian peninsula with the establishment of many national rugby federations and the development of the Dubai Sevens.\nIn 2009, the Lebanese Rugby Union Federation was established with the intention of developing the game at a local level and representing Lebanon on the international rugby scene. The Federation was formed by representatives of the Beirut Phoenicians, Ahed/Reay, Jamhour Black Lions and Grey Wolves Rugby Clubs. In 2013, the Jounieh Rugby Club was formed and applied to join the LRUF. During this period the Lebanese Rugby Union Federation was recognised as a member of the Asian Rugby Federation Union. \nThe Current State of Lebanese Rugby Union.\nThe Lebanese Rugby Union Federation at the present time is made up of five teams, which play in domestic tournaments including,\nIt is from these clubs that players are selected to play for the Lebanese National team, which is often supplemented by expatriate Lebanese players from nations with large Lebanese expatriate communities with an interest in Rugby such as England and Australia. The Lebanese National team competes in the Asian Rugby Federation Union competition.\nDomestically.\nLebanese Club Championship.\nThe Lebanese Rugby Union Federation's representative side, \"Phoenix Select XV\" competes in rugby matches against visiting United Nations Interim Force troop teams including teams from the French, Irish and Fijian battalions stationed in Southern Lebanon.\nInternationally.\nThe Lebanese National Rugby Union Team, the \"Phoenix\" has participated in international tournaments and test matches since the inception of the Federation in 2009. \nLebanese Expatriate Rugby Participation.\nThe Australian Lebanese community has had a long and proud association with the game of rugby union commencing within a short period of time after the establishment of the Syrian (Lebanese) colony in Australia. In 1888, George P Barbour was selected to represent the New South Wales Waratahs against Queensland and from 1894 to 1897 All (Alf) Hanna played 16 Caps for the Waratahs.\nUndoubtedly, the most distinguished of all rugby players of Australian Lebanese descent is former Australian Wallabies Captain and President of the Australian Rugby Football Union (ARU), Sir Nicholas Shehadie AC. OBE. Sir Nicholas began playing at the age of 15 and played more than 175 club games for the famous 'Galloping Greens', the Randwick Rugby Club.\nHis career eventually spanned almost five decades representing the Waratahs with 37 caps and by age 20, Sir Nicholas was selected to represent Australia against the New Zealand All Blacks in the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1947.\nWhile not being able to definitively single out a greatest career highlight, Sir Nicholas remembers with great fondness his selection in the nine-month tour of the United Kingdom, France and North America in 1947/48. Eventually playing more than 100 games for the Wallabies, Sir Nicholas captained Australia three times. The Australian Rugby Union still considers him to be \"one of the world's best props, Sir Nicholas Shehadie set a new Australian record for being the most capped Wallaby, with 30 Tests to his name between 1947 and 1958.\"\nSir Nicholas was selected to tour Europe with the Wallabies in 1958, ten years after his previous tour. At the end of the tour, he was selected to represent the prestigious Barbarian Football Club against his beloved Wallabies. Neither feat had ever been accomplished by any other player. His illustrious rugby career did not end with his playing retirement. He went on to become the President of the Australian Rugby Football Union from 1980 to 1986 and was instrumental in establishing the inaugural Rugby World Cup, which is now the third largest sporting event after the Olympics and the Football World Cup. Sir Nicholas was inducted into the ARU Hall of Fame in 2006 and the International Rugby Board's Hall of Fame in 2011.\nDuring Sir Nicholas' era there were a number of Australians of Lebanese descent playing rugby union at grade or state level. Nick Aboud played 1 cap for the Waratahs in 1935 and Sir Nicholas' brother, George Shehadie played for the Eastern Suburbs Rugby Club. George went on to be selected for the Waratahs for 3 caps in 1960.\nWhile Manager of the 1981 Australian Wallabies tour of the United Kingdom, Sir Nicholas had the regrettable honour of having to farewell Wallabies' Hooker, Bruce Malouf who unfortunately broke his ankle at a training session four days after arriving in the UK.\nCurrent New South Wales Waratahs Head Coach, Michael Cheika played more than 300 games for the Randwick Rugby Club, captaining Randwick from 1997 to 1999 winning seven Shute Shield Premierships. He represented Australia in the Under 20s and played three games for the Waratahs in 1997. Michael made a successful transition into coaching winning the European Championship with Leinster Rugby Union Club. Michael Cheika played for Randwick against the World Champion All Blacks at Coogee Oval in 1988, the only domestic Australian Club to play an international team in the 20th century.\nYet it is not just the New South Welshmen of Lebanese descent who have represented at the highest levels of rugby union. Queenslanders have a fierce reputation for being hard-hitting and powerful rugby players with Brendon Nasser being no exception. Playing in the position of flanker, Brendon had an illustrious rugby career with Queensland from 1986 to 1992 before being selected to represent Australia as a Wallaby in 1989/90. Brendon played eight Test matches for the Wallabies and was a member of the 1991 World Cup winning squad. In 1992, his final year of international representative rugby, Brendon was selected to play in a World XV against New Zealand to celebrate the All Blacks' Centenary of Rugby.\nMany younger players of Lebanese descent have represented Australia at an international Schoolboy level including David Azar, Nicholas Ghattas, David Basha, Robert Shehadie and Anthony Nehme.\nOther players of Lebanese origin that have played at an international level of Rugby include New Zealand All Black, Joe Karam. An extremely hard trainer at a club level, Karam was named as an All Black for the 1972–73 tour of the British Isles and France. He played 10 test matches for the All Blacks between 1972 and 1975. Joe Karam was inducted into the Lebanese Rugby Union Federation's Hall of Fame in a ceremony in 2013 for his contribution to international rugby.\nOmar Hasan, who is Lebanese, phase been voted as the best tighthead prop by world rugby"

        "text": "The Australian national cricket team toured India in the winter of 1959–60. The two teams played five Tests, with Australia winning two, India winning one, and two others being drawn. The Australians also played several matches against domestic Indian squads.\nAt the time of its arrival in India, the Australian cricket team was acclaimed as the strongest side in the world, having won 11 of its last 16 Tests and lost none. In the years just prior, they had not only defeated India, but also South Africa, England, and Pakistan as well. The confident Aussies, led by captain Richie Benaud, featured such names as Neil Harvey, Norm O'Neill, Ray Lindwall, and Ian Meckiff among others. Meanwhile, India had dropped 11 of its last 13 Tests, including humbling defeats at the hands of Australia, the West Indies, and England, and had not won a single one. The Indians seemed to be struggling with every aspect of the game – batting, bowling, and fielding – not to mention leadership and the maintenance of a \"fighting spirit.\" Hence, this series between Benaud's Australians and Gulabrai Ramchand's Indian team had a true David vs. Goliath nature to it.\nTest matches.\n2nd Test.\nThe second Test at Kanpur was notable for being India's first-ever Test victory over the Australians. Indian off-spinner Jasu Patel distinguished himself, taking 14 wickets in the match (nine wickets in the first innings and five in the second). He would go on to take 19 wickets in the series."

        "title": "Albert Sharpe (American football)",
        "text": "Albert Hayes Sharpe (October 7, 1877 – May 17, 1966) was an All-American football player, coach and athletic director and medical doctor. He played football for Yale University and was selected as a halfback for the 1899 College Football All-America Team. Sharpe was also a star basketball player in the early years of the college game. Sharpe also excelled in baseball, gymnastics, rowing and track. In 1915, Sharpe was selected by one sporting expert as the greatest living athlete in the United States. He later served as a coach and administrator at Cornell University, Yale, the Ithaca School of Physical Education and Washington University in St. Louis.\nAthlete at Yale.\nFootball.\nSharpe began his athletic career as a student at the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia. After graduating from the Penn School, Sharpe enrolled at Yale University, where he played halfback for the Yale football team from 1898 to 1900. He also handled punting and place-kicking responsibilities for the team. In 1899, he was selected as an All-American in football. On the gridiron, Sharpe's \"end running and kicking thrilled Yale students.\" In 1929, sports writer Lawrence Perry wrote that Sharpe was best recalled for a 50-yard dropkick in the 1899 Yale-Princeton game. In an October 1900 game against Amherst, Sharpe had one of his best games. A contemporary newspaper account reported: \"Sharpe was again the sensational hero of the game. He got Yale's first touchdown by a series of three runs that carried the ball for 85 yards. He got Yale's second touchdown when the first half was almost ended by a 95-yard run that set the grand stand wild.\"\nBasketball pioneer.\nSharpe was also a pioneer of college basketball. Intercollegiate basketball did not gain traction until the 1900s, but Yale students organized a team in the 1890s. In February 1898, Sharpe led Yale's basketball team to a 27–7 win over New York's Knickerbocker Athletic Club. A newspaper account of the game praised Yale for its \"signal work\" in passing the ball from one to another without a hitch. Sharpe led all scorers with five goals including a halfcourt shot described as follows:\"In the second half Sharp wound up the good work of his team by throwing a goal from the centre of the field on a backward pass from Lockwood. The ball sailed through the air and landed in the basket without touching anything. This was an unusual feat.\"\nIn January and February 1899, Sharpe played left forward and center on a Yale basketball team that played games against teams from the New Britain Athletic Club, the Fourth Separate Company of Yonkers, and Trinity College. In December 1899, Sharpe was elected captain of the Yale basketball team. On the day after Christmas 1899, Sharpe led the Yale basketball team on a road trip for a series of seven games against teams from the Midwest, including the Western University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State, a team made up from the Wisconsin Second Regiment of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. After returning from the Western trip, Sharpe led Yale to a 30–10 victory over the Dreadnought Athletic Club—a New York team considered one of the best in basketball at the time.\nAll round athlete.\nSharpe also excelled in other sports. He was referred to in 1919 as \"the best all around athlete Yale has produced, having won his varsity letter when at Yale, in three branches of sport—football, baseball and crew.\" In addition to football and basketball, Sharpe was also a fine baseball player and a skilled gymnast. In 1900, \"The New York Times\" noted that \"Sharpe of Yale is as good a first baseman as he is a halfback, which is saying a good deal.\" In 1915, Dr. A.C. May, a noted athletic trainer, rated Sharpe as \"the greatest living all round athlete today.\" May supported his selection as follows:\"Look at him once and you will see the reason for his success. He is 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weights 196 pounds. He is evenly proportioned and owes his build, not to athletics, but in gymnastics, and he owed his athletic success not to his build so much as his ability to handle his body, which he developed in the gymnasium. He can handle himself on the bars and rings and other apparatus with as much skill as he can play football or other sports. He can turn a backward and forward flip and he knows the other tricks of a gymnast. ... Sharpe could row, run a fine relay, jump, put the shot, and, in fact, do about anything on the athletic field.\"\nAfter completing his undergraduate studies, Sharpe attended Yale Medical School and became a medical doctor.\nAthletic coach, administrator and official.\nIn 1901, Sharpe accepted a position as the director of physical education at the William Penn Charter School. He remained at the William Penn school for nine years.\nDuring his time at William Penn, Sharpe remained active in college football, serving as an official at important college football games, including the Army–Navy Games. Sharpe also spoke out about various proposals to reform or change the rules of football. He was quoted as saying that young men in the United States needed football, because it was \"the only game in which a gentleman can fight.\" While defending the game, Sharpe conceded that some rule changes were appropriate: \"Slight changes will be made in the rules by us, fully believing that the accidents this year were due to coincidence rather than to any unnecessary roughness in the game.\"\nSharpe also advocated relaxation on the rule against professionalism. In 1905, amid calls to rid college athletics of professionalism, Sharpe spoke in favor of allowing college baseball players to play summer baseball to earn some money. He proposed that \"scholarship, not professionalism, should be the basis of eligibility tests.\"\nCornell.\nIn February 1912, Sharpe was hired by Cornell University where he served as the coach of the football, basketball and baseball teams. In 1915, he coached the first Cornell football team that ranked at the top of the Eastern schools. At the end of the 1915 season, sports writer Frank G. Menke offered Sharpe (along with Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn Warner and Percy Haughton) as one of the coaches deserving of consideration as the All-American coach. Menke wrote:\"Al Sharpe at Cornell started the season with only one real star from his 1914 eleven -- Charles Barrett, the amazing quarterback. But Sharpe wasn't discouraged. He took the material that offered and built it around Barrett. He tinkered with that machine; he worked at it unceasingly. As a result, he has given to Cornell the greatest team it has had in a decade; a team that beat Harvard decisively; a team that has swept along, unbeaten, toward the championship goal.\"\nSharpe's six-year record as football coach at Cornell was 34–21–1. His best seasons at Cornell were the three years from 1914 to 1916, when the Big Red football teams were 23–4 and outscored opponents 709 to 177.\nYale.\nIn 1919, Sharpe returned to Yale as athletic director and football coach. Sharpe had built a reputation at Cornell as one of the country's best athletic coaches. \"The Washington Post\" reported on Sharpe's hiring as follows:\"Yale undergraduates and alumni welcome the news that Dr. Albert Sharpe, long athletic coach at Cornell , will return to his alma mater after an absence of sixteen years. Sharpe has made a reputation since he became the dominant figure in Cornell athletics as the greatest all round coach in the country. ... Sharpe's appointment is in keeping with the new athletic .policy of the colleges and universities of the country. As the active director of major sports, he in reality will be a member of the faculty. Instead of being a seasonal coach he will be at New Haven the year round.\"\nAfter a disappointing 5–3 performance by the Yale football team in 1919, Sharpe was replaced as Yale's football coach by Tad Jones. Sharpe remained the athletic director until 1921.\nIthaca College.\nIn March 1921, Sharpe announced that he would resign as Yale's athletic director when his contract expired in June. After leaving Yale, Sharpe founded and served as the president of the Ithaca School of Physical Education, later part as Ithaca College. Sharpe remained at the Ithaca School of Physical Education from 1921 to 1927. While at the Ithaca school, Sharpe also developed a reputation as one of the leading football and basketball officials in the East.\nWashington University in St. Louis.\nIn 1928, Sharpe became the athletic director and head football coach at Washington University in St. Louis. When he was hired at Washington University, sports writer Lawrence Perry wrote: \"No athletic director and coach coulc by any possibility have more friends pulling for him than this former Yale backfield star whose character is so outstanding that no young men ever came in contact with him without being better for it.\" In four years as head football coach (1928–1931), Sharpe's teams compiled a disappointing record of 11–18–4. In 1932, Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Jimmy Conzelman replaced Sharpe as football coach, but Sharpe stayed on as the university's athletic director.\nLater years.\nIn the 1930s, Sharpe was also the president of the Touchdown Club, an organization of former football players, and an executive with the Red Cross. Sharpe lived in East Aurora, New York in his later years. He died at Buffalo General Hospital in 1966 at age 88."

Players were given cards of real baseball players from all of baseball's ages (card sets range from 1907 to the 2009 MLB All Star Game) to create teams of players using their cards. Players then attempted to move up \"classes,\" from Rookie to Hall of Fame by defeating other players' teams through simulated challenges. Players spent tickets, earned for sending challenges to other teams, to purchase new packs of cards from the Market or new cards from other users in the Auction House. \"Baseball Boss\" features two brands of cards, the \"National\" base brand and the \"Spire\" premium brand. In addition to playing against other online users, \"Baseball Boss\" allowed users to collect entire sets or a group of their favorite cards in a way that resembled virtual baseball card collecting, using \"Shoeboxes\".\n\"Baseball Boss\" shut down operations on March 10, 2010 when the sponsor, Challenge Games, was unable to license certain rights from Major League Baseball. In June 2010 Challenge Games was purchased by Zynga.\nThe Cards.\nVirtual baseball cards were a central part of the \"Baseball Boss\" game experience. A player's virtual baseball card collection was used to build their team's rosters. Like real life baseball players, each baseball player card has ratings and abilities that affect the outcome of game play. The card's ratings and abilities were based upon historical statistics for that real life baseball player in a given year. Each card also had a rarity tier and a corresponding color. This attribute measured how rare the card was within the overall distribution of the game. Tier 1 cards were the most common, and Tier 7 cards were the rarest.\nThe color system is as follows:\n• Tier 1 – Grey\n• Tier 2 – White\n• Tier 3 – Green\n• Tier 4 – Blue\n• Tier 5 – Purple\n• Tier 6 – Orange\n• Tier 7 – Red\n\"Baseball Boss\" offered two brands of cards, Spire and National. Both of these card brands also had attributes that affected game play. For example, Tier 6 and 7 cards were only available in a Spire brand.\nManaging Teams.\nAn owner played the role of both general manager and manager for each team they create. A team's roster contained up to 25 players and is built from an owner's baseball card collection. The owner then set fielding positions, batting lineups, starting rotations and bullpen assignments. After these decisions are made, the owner's team wa ready to compete against other players with a number of game types.\nGame Currencies.\n• Challenge Coins – Challenge Coins wee the virtual currency of Challenge Online Games. They were used to acquire items and services in any of their free-to-play online titles. Challenge Coins could be purchased with real money or exchanged for tickets in \"Baseball Boss\" in the game's currency exchange.\n• Tickets - Tickets were the official in-game currency of \"Baseball Boss\". Tickets were generated from playing various game types and milestones. Tickets were used to purchase packs and other items from the Card Store.\n\"Baseball Boss\" Membership.\nPlayers could buy memberships to the game. Members gained multiple benefits, including an unlimited number of card collection slots, and weekly stipends of packs and Challenge Coins.\nEnd Game.\nChallenge Games ceased operations with \"Baseball Boss\" effective March 10, 2010. Exact details could not be provided per standard procedures in relation to the game."

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between the British &amp; Irish Lions and other countries",
        "text": "Since 1989, the British &amp; Irish Lions have developed a regular 12-year cycle of tours visiting one of the following three Southern Hemisphere nations, in turn, every four years:\nHowever the history of their tours is more variable and diverse than the current status quo might indicate. Prior to the Second World War the Lions routinely toured Argentina, tours of Australia and New Zealand were frequently carried out in the same trip, intervals between tours were sometimes as much as 14 years (1910–1924) and sometimes as little as one year (1903, 1904) or even in the same year (1910 South Africa and Argentina). Additionally, whilst making tours the Lions would frequently play other neighbouring nations or teams in countries where the ship pulled into port or where the aircraft landed en route.\nThe Lions have also played several one-off matches when not on tour; these have all taken place in the United Kingdom with the exception of one match played in France.\nThe Lions have not always awarded caps for these matches, depending on whether it was felt by the team management that the opposition merited full-international status.\nMatches in minor rugby playing nations.\nThe Lions played Rhodesia (a territory which, at different times in history comprised one or more of the modern day countries of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe), South-West Africa (now Namibia) and East Africa (a British colony composed of Kenya, Tanzania/Tanganyika and Uganda) on some of their earlier South African tours. While travelling to or from Australia, New Zealand or Argentina, the Lions also played matches against teams in Canada, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Fiji.\nCanada.\nOne of the most famous matches in Canadian rugby history became known as the \"victory for the ages\"; it was British Columbia's defeat of the 1966 British Lions\nsee:\n1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand\n1966 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand\nCeylon.\nOn the return journey to the UK, the Lions stopped off in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to play the final tour match of the 1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia and the 1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia. The games were played on 1 October 1930 and 18 September 1950, both at the Racecourse in Colombo. The 1930 game was won 45–0. The 1950 local team was composed of executive staff from British companies, British armed forces and three local players: Summa Navaratnam, Leslie Ephraims and Clair Roeloffsz. The Lions won 44–6. This was to be the last Lions match played by the great Irish outside-half, Jack Kyle.\nsee:\n1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia\n1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia\nEast Africa.\nWhen the British Lions went to South Africa for their 1955 and 1962 tours, they played East Africa in Nairobi on the return legs of their journeys. The Lions won both of these games, 39–12 and 50–0 respectively. The 1955 game was East Africa's first international and also saw the official opening of the team's home stadium, the RFUEA Ground, then called the Ngong Road Ground. \nsee:\n1955 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1962 British Lions tour to South Africa\nFiji.\nOn 16 August 1977, Fiji played their 88th test match and first against the British Lions. An examination of Fiji's results in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s demonstrates that they were far more proficient at the 15-man game than they are today. A hard-fought game saw the lead change four times with no side getting more than seven points ahead at any time. Fiji scored five tries to the Lions' three and finished worthy winners. The Lions made one replacement during the match, Gordon Brown going on for Trevor Evans. Fiji picked six replacements but used none.\nsee:\n1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand\nRhodesia.\nA regular feature of Lions tours to South Africa between 1910 and 1974 were matches played against Rhodesia, though during this period of history in Southern Africa the designation of Rhodesia is not straightforward. At its simplest it can be regarded as the territories that today comprise Zambia and Zimbabwe. These territories in no way can be regarded as a single entity, let alone a country. It is also not apparent if players selected to play for Rhodesia were drawn from one, two or all three of these territories or even (for the period between 1953 and 1963) if any players came from modern day Malawi.\nIn 1910 when the Lions first visited, Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia were two independent territories (administered by the British South Africa Company that together essentially made up the modern day country of Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia was a British colony that is now Zimbabwe.\nBy the time of the 1924 and 1938 Lions tours, North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia had been merged to form the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia; the colony of Southern Rhodesia still existed.\nFor the 1955 and 1962 tours, these two territories had been combined and, along with modern-day Malawi, made up the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\nIn 1964 Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were granted independence and became Zambia and Malawi respectively. Southern Rhodesia remained a colony and called itself Rhodesia (between 1964 and 1979) and Zimbabwe Rhodesia (in 1979), though this name was not accepted by the British government who, until the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980, continued to call the territory Southern Rhodesia.\nsee:\n1910 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1924 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1938 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1955 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1962 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1968 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1974 British Lions tour to South Africa\nSouth West Africa.\nAs for Rhodesia above, the designation of South West Africa is not simple but for different reasons. The area of land has always been essentially the territory that makes up modern day Namibia; but its legal status was far from clear. As with South Africa, it was essentially under an apartheid regime.\nSouth West Africa was a German colony (German South West Africa) from 1884, several small parts were annexed by Britain and added to the Cape Colony which itself was combined with Colony of Natal, Transvaal Colony and the Orange River Colony to become the Commonwealth realm of the Union of South Africa in 1910. After World War I South-West Africa was declared a League of Nations Mandate to be administered by South Africa and after World War II it was supposed to become a United Nations Trust Territory, but South Africa objected and refused to allow it to achieve independence. South Africa's position was supported by the International Court of Justice which required, however, that South Africa follow the previously applied League of Nations Mandate.\nThus for the 1955 and 1962 Lions tours South West Africa was being regarded and administered as a fifth province of South Africa though it was never officially incorporated into the Commonwealth realm.\nIn 1966 the United Nations General Assembly declared the League of Nations Mandate terminated and required that South Africa withdraw from Namibia immediately. There followed a protracted struggle for independence by the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) with the territory finally achieving independence as the Republic of Namibia in 1990. As a result, when the Lions played South-West Africa in 1968, 1974 and 1980 they were technically playing an independent nation that should have been called Namibia, but a nation that was yet to come into existence.\nsee:\n1955 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1962 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1968 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1974 British Lions tour to South Africa\n1980 British Lions tour to South Africa\nOne-off matches (not part of a tour).\nThe British &amp; Irish Lions have made three official non-tour appearances, all of which have been on home soil. Teams styled as \"the Lions\" have turned out on three additional occasions, two on home soil and one in France. Four of these matches have been played in Cardiff (three at the Arms Park and one in the Millennium Stadium), one has been played at Twickenham stadium, London and one at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\nOne other match, The Skilball Trophy match has been played by a Four Home Unions side against The Rest of Europe to raise money in aid of the rebuilding of Romania following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceaușescu. It was played at Twickenham on 22 April 1990, the home side wore the Lions badge on their shirts but were not officially a British Lions side.\nCardiff RFC.\nThe first match of a British Lions team played not while on tour took place on 22 September 1951 at Cardiff Arms Park against the Cardiff club side. The match is sometimes listed as the last game of the Lions 1950 tour, though this was technically not a true Lions team. It may have been difficult to pick a full Lions side however as five members of that Lions touring party played for Cardiff; Billy Cleaver, Jack Matthews, Bleddyn Williams, Rex Willis and Cliff Davies. The match, which was staged to celebrate Cardiff's 75th Anniversary, was won by the Lions 14–12.\nWales.\nThe second Lions match at home, though sometimes listed as the last match of the 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa was also not technically a true British Lions match; it was not officially sanctioned by the team and did not include all the big names of that tour, such as Tony O'Reilly, Jeff Butterfield, Phil Davies, Dickie Jeeps, Bryn Meredith and Jim Greenwood. This match too was played at the Cardiff Arms Park, then the Welsh national stadium, against a Welsh XV on 22 October 1955. This match was staged to mark the 75th anniversary of the Welsh Rugby Union, the Lions won 20–17.\nsee:\n1955 (vs Wales XV)\nBarbarians.\nThe first officially sanctioned home match was a charity fund-raiser held as part of the Queen's silver jubilee celebrations; it was played at Twickenham on 10 September 1977 against the Barbarians. The Lions were at full tour party strength and the Barbarian side included J. P. R. Williams, Gerald Davies, Gareth Edwards, Jean-Pierre Rives and Jean-Claude Skrela. The match nearly did not take place, the players threatened to boycott the match when their wives and partners were initially not invited to attend. The Lions won 23–14. A second meeting between the sides took place in Hong Kong on 1 June 2013 before the Lions embarked on their tour of Australia, The Lions won the match 59–8. \nsee:\n1977 (vs Barbarians)\n\"The Rest\".\nOn 16 April 1986, the second officially sanctioned Lions home match was played against \"The Rest\" (meaning the other member countries of the International Rugby Board) at Cardiff Arms Park. This was a warm-up match played both to prepare the side for the impending tour to South Africa and also as a celebration match to mark the International Board's centenary. It turned out to be the only match played by this Lions side; the tour had already been called off by the hosts under political pressure due to the apartheid regime that still existed in South Africa. The Lions won the match 15–7.\nsee:\nBritish Lions v The Rest\nFrance.\nOn 4 October 1989, a Lions team played a match at the Parc des Princes against France. The Lions were made up mostly of players form the recently completed tour to Australia. The match formed part of the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution. France lost the match 29–27.\nsee:\n1989 (vs France)\nArgentina.\nThe most recent officially sanctioned Lions home match was played against Argentina at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 23 May 2005. Although six test matches have been played against Argentina on three tours (one in 1910, four in 1927 and one in 1936), they have only faced the Lions this one time on foreign soil. The match was designed to be a warm-up match for the impending tour to New Zealand. The Pumas were underdogs going into the match, never having won a match in their 95-year history of playing the Lions. However, they played a scintillating game and were only denied victory by a Jonny Wilkinson penalty seven minutes after the end of regulation time. The final result was a 25–25 draw.\nsee:\n2005 (vs Argentina)\nJapan.\nA match against Japan at Murrayfield in Edinburgh was scheduled for 26 June 2021 to serve as a warm-up for that year's tour of South Africa."

        "text": "Andrey Alexandrovich Kuznetsov (, born 22 February 1991) is a Russian professional tennis player and coach. On 25 April 2016, he achieved his singles career-high of world No. 39.\nKuznetsov won the Boys' Singles title at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships.\nCareer.\nEarly life.\nAndrey Kuznestov started playing tennis at age six, coached by his father Alexander. In 2001, his family moved to Balashikha, attending the sports club there. His father resumed coaching Andrey and his elder brother Alexey.\nAccording to some mass media reports, Andrey allegedly had problems with his back since his childhood, so he attended manual therapies. But Andrey's coach and father declined it, stating he had problems with his hip and the therapy could be described as tough fitness.\n2006–09: Grand Slam Junior title.\nKuznetsov played his first ITF junior tournament at the 2006 Black Gold of Udmurtia, but received a walkover in the qualifying round. His first notable achievement was at the Governor Cup in St. Petersburg, reaching the semi-finals there. He reached his first final at the NBU Cup in Uzbekistan. Most of the tournaments were on a clay court, but in 2007 he played on carpet and hard. In this season he reached three finals in singles, winning once, and three doubles finals in doubles, winning twice. His best season was in 2008, when he won three singles titles and played well in doubles. Andrey's last junior tournament became the 2009 Wimbledon, winning his first Grand Slam title. For the first time in 43 years a Russian won the Wimbledon since Soviet Vladimir Korotkov achieved that feat in 1965 and 1966.\nAs a junior Kuznetsov posted an 80–24 win–loss record in singles, reaching a combined ranking of No. 3 in the world in July 2009.\n2010–15: Grand Slam debut, Top 100, first Grand Slam and first top-10 win.\nHe made his first main draw Grand Slam appearance at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships where he lost in five sets to the 31st seed Romanian Victor Hănescu.\nHe defeated the 11th seed of the 2013 Australian Open, Juan Mónaco in straight sets in the first round to reach the second round of a Grand Slam for the first time.\nAt Wimbledon in 2014, Kuznetsov recorded his first win over a player ranked inside the world's top-10 by defeating seventh seed David Ferrer in five sets. The win also took Kuznetsov to the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.\nAt the 2014 US Open, he defeated Fernando Verdasco in the second round, but lost to Andy Murray in the third round.\nAt the 2015 Australian Open, he got into the second round, but lost to the top seed Novak Djokovic.\n2016: Russian No. 1, second top-10 win.\nAndrey debuted in 2016 at the Qatar Open, losing in the quarterfinals to Rafael Nadal in three tight sets. At the 2016 Australian Open, he got his best ever result in a grand slam, beating Dudi Sela to make it to the fourth round. In the following tournaments he got beyond the first rounds. Reaching the second round of the Miami Open, Kuznetsov became Russia's new number one male tennis player, replacing Teymuraz Gabashvili, who lost in Miami in the first round. Kuznetsov in the second round defeated 4th-seeded Stan Wawrinka, the second time he won against a top-10 player. He then beat Adrian Mannarino in the third round 2–6, 7–5, 6–0. In the fourth round he lost to Nick Kyrgios 6–7, 3–6.\nKuznetsov debuted at the Olympic Games. In the first round he retired before the start of the third set of the match against Roberto Bautista Agut because of injury.\n2017: First 3 ATP singles semifinals and first doubles final.\nAfter a first round loss to fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Doha, Kuznetsov made his maiden ATP semifinal appearance in Sydney where he fell to fellow first time semifinalist Dan Evans in another three setter. In the first round of the Australian Open, he pushed fifth seed Kei Nishikori to five sets. In the first round of the Davis Cup World Group, he teamed up with Konstantin Kravchuk in Russia's doubles rubber against Serbia but they lost in four sets to Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjić. A week later, he lost to Troicki and Zimonjić again, this time in the doubles final of the Garanti Koza Sofia Open. He ended a three match losing streak at the Miami Open where he reached the second round.\nKuznetsov began his clay season in Monte Carlo where he qualified for the main draw following wins over established players Julien Benneteau and Mikhail Youzhny. He then lost to the ninth seed Tomas Berdych after taking the first set. He reached his second quarterfinal of the year at the inaugural Hungarian Open where he upset the third seed Fabio Fognini en route. After a three set first round loss to Tsonga at the Mutua Madrid Open, Kuznetsov advanced to his second ATP semifinal in singles at the Geneva Open where he fell to world No. 3 and defending champion Stan Wawrinka in straight sets. At the French Open, he took a set off world No. 1 Andy Murray in the first round. In the SkiStar Swedish Open he made it to his third career semifinal, also his third semifinal this year. He first beat German tennis player Jan-Lennard Struff in only 2 sets. He then defeated no.1 seed, Pablo Carreño Busta, after Carreño Busta retired in the third set. He then beat 7th seed Diego Schwartzman in the quarterfinals in straight sets to eventually lose to Alexandr Dolgopolov in the semifinals.\n2018–2019: Hiatus and coaching career.\nKuznetsov's only tournament of 2018 was when he participated in the Koblenz Challenger, taking place in January and lost his first round match against alternate player Ilya Ivashka.\nIn 2019, he was announced as the coach of Russian tennis player Evgeny Donskoy.\n2020: Comeback, Challenger title and French Open qualification.\nKuznetsov returned on court at the 2020 US Open after nearly three years absence.

He likes to hit it very hard and especially cross-court. While his forehand used to be somewhat of a weakness, it has now developed into a competent shot which he can use as a weapon. On the other hand, his main weakness is his second serve.\nPatrick Mouratoglou in 2011 noted his flat shots, nice serve and volley play and a great forehand, but also felt his shot placement and movement should be improved.\nPersonal life.\nOn 30 June 2018, Kuznetsov married Darya Levchenko, a TV show presenter on Match TV.\nSingles performance timeline.\n\"Current through the 2022 Australian Open.\""

        "text": "Rugby union in Colombia is a minor but growing sport, with around 15,000 registered players and 80 rugby union clubs in Colombia. The Colombian national team is currently ranked 44th by World Rugby.\nThe governing body is the Colombian Rugby Federation (Federación Colombiana de Rugby or F.C.R. in Spanish)\nHistory.\nRugby was first introduced into Colombia from the southern parts of South America, but really started going in the mid 1970s, when British and French expats, along with Colombians who had received rugby training at the Alianza Francesa, played on Sundays in Bogotá. By the 1990s there was a growing number of Colombians engaged in the sport. In 1977 Colombia hosted a visiting team from Ecuador, and in 1978 a Colombian team captained by Brian Perry (veterinarian) from the Bogota Sports Club travelled to Ecuador, playing the international match on a ground near the equator north of the capital Quito.\nIn Colombia, rugby is not well supported by the government or media, as football (soccer) has a stronger tradition in the country. The Colombian rugby team is called Los Tucanes.\nThe game is centred nowadays in most regions, with a very strong presence in Medellin, due to wide support from the local government, which uses rugby for social and performance programs.\nBrian Perry (veterinarian) initiated sevens rugby in Bogota in 1977 with mostly expats, then Hans Joseph Rausch, a Medellín-born player, who in 1994, after having played in Pittsburg, introduced Rugby to locals and started the first Colombian generation of players.\nLos Tucanes, have been active internationally since 2000, although the Colombian Federation just became official in 2010. They have won five of the last seven U18s \"Suramericano B\" Tournaments (against Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador) and the last four with their senior side. Right now they are disputing with Paraguay a spot in the \"Suramericano A\" (against Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Brasil).\nWomen's rugby.\nColombia's women's national side qualified for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and has a strong presence by South American level standards."

For a number of years, the local rugby scene was dominated by expatriates.\nIn 1954, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment was stationed in Guyana, and formed their own team to play local sides in the colony. They played sides formed of British and Portuguese residents of Georgetown and the sugar estates. The soldiers had not played for a long while, but had an advantage due to their physical fitness.\nGuyana has done particularly well in the Caribbean Sevens.\nIt also supports two national teams."

        "text": "The 2013 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France was a tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team to compete at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. New Zealand won Pool B of the tournament as well as their quarter and semi-finals, before losing to Australia 2-34 in the World Cup final.\nNew Zealand were the defending World Cup champions after winning the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.\nBackground.\nAlongside Australia and France, New Zealand have competed at all thirteen World Cups. New Zealand finished runner up in 1988 and 2000 before winning the 2008 World Cup by defeating Australia 34-20 in the final.\nAfter the 2008 tournament, international football focused on three Four Nations tournaments held between 2009 and 2011. New Zealand won the 2010 tournament but finished third in 2009 and 2011. New Zealand also lost four Anzac Test matches to Australia in this period and two trans-Tasman test matches.\nBuild up.\nNew Zealand held a pre-season training camp in Sydney in January 2013 to start their World Cup build up. The camp involved between 30 and 40 players and was funded by Sport New Zealand.\nIn February, Benji Marshall was stripped of the captaincy and replaced with Simon Mannering. Marshall had been the Kiwis captain since 2009 but his form had been poor at international level as captain.\nThe New Zealand Kiwis played the annual ANZAC test against Australia at Canberra Stadium on 19 April, losing 12-32. The squad was Josh Hoffman, Sam Perrett, Shaun Kenny-Dowall, Dean Whare, Jason Nightingale, Kieran Foran (c), Shaun Johnson, Jesse Bromwich, Issac Luke, Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, Frank Pritchard, Kevin Proctor, Alex Glenn, Bench: Elijah Taylor, Sam McKendry, Ben Matulino, Tohu Harris. Captain Simon Mannering was ruled out on the day of the test, with Glenn replacing him in the starting side and Harris joining the bench. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck was the reserve.\nBenji Marshall signed for rugby union franchise the Blues in August, making him unavailable for the Kiwis World Cup squad. Sonny Bill Williams also declared himself unavailable for the World Cup.\nDuring the 2013 NRL Grand Final, Shaun Kenny-Dowall was injured and was subsequently ruled out of the World Cup.\nFollowing the naming of the squad, Sonny Bill Williams declared that he would be available for the tournament. After deliberation, he was added to the squad at the expense of Tohu Harris. Harris declined the offer to travel with the squad as a travelling reserve.\nThe Kiwis assembled in Narrabeen, Sydney for a two-day training camp before flying to the United Kingdom.\nStaff.\nThe national selectors were Richie Barnett, Ivan Cleary, Stephen Kearney and Tawera Nikau, with Tony Iro serving as the convenor of selectors.\nSquad.\nTrain-on squad.\nAn initial training squad was named on 11 September 2015 and added to as teams were eliminated from the NRL finals.\nBrisbane Broncos: Alex Glenn, Josh Hoffman\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs: Greg Eastwood, Krisnan Inu, Sam Kasiano, Sam Perrett, Frank Pritchard\nMelbourne Storm: Jesse Bromwich, Tohu Harris, Kevin Proctor\nNorth Queensland Cowboys: Jason Taumalolo, Antonio Winterstein\nSt George Illawarra Dragons: Bronson Harrison, Jason Nightingale\nPenrith Panthers: Lewis Brown, Sam McKendry, Dean Whare\nNew Zealand Warriors: Shaun Johnson, Thomas Leuluai, Kevin Locke, Simon Mannering, Ben Matulino, Sam Rapira, Elijah Taylor, Manu Vatuvei\nWests Tigers: Adam Blair, Tim Simona\nUnavailable: Gerard Beale, Benji Marshall\nFixtures.\nWarm up match.\nNew Zealand played a warm up match against the Cook Islands on 20 October in Doncaster. The match was played with unlimited interchange and as a result was not regarded as a test match. It was Simon Mannering's first match as Kiwis captain. The halftime score was 24-0.\n1 Josh Hoffman, 2 Jason Nightingale, 3 Krisnan Inu, 4 Dean Whare, 5 Manu Vatuvei, 6 Kieran Foran, 7 Shaun Johnson, 8 Jesse Bromwich, 9 Issac Luke, 10 Sam Kasiano, 11 Frank Pritchard, 12 Simon Mannering (c), 13 Elijah Taylor. Interchange: 14 Greg Eastwood, 15 Ben Matulino, 16 Alex Glenn, 17 Kevin Locke, 18 Bryson Goodwin, 19 Roger Tuivasa-Sheck\nWorld Cup Pool B.\nPapua New Guinea.\nThe 18,180 attendance was higher than all but one of Leeds Rhinos' home Super League attendances for 2013.\nSemi-final.\nNew Zealand won the match when Shaun Johnson scored a try with 20 seconds remaining.\nTouch Judges:\nJames Child (England)\nGrant Atkins (Australia)\nVideo Referee:\nAshley Klein (Australia)\nFinal.\nTouch Judges:\nVideo Referee:\nAftermath.\nDuring the tournament several players were accused of mixing sleeping pills with energy drinks to help their recovery. While not illegal, concerns were raised by New Zealand support staff. Sonny Bill Williams and Kieran Foran were named as two of the players involved. The All Blacks had a similar problem at the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The National Rugby League set up a taskforce in response to the issue, with NZRL represented by high performance manager Tony Iro.\nThe NZRL's player of the year was Kieran Foran.\nFollowing a post campaign review, the NZRL re-appointed Stephen Kearney for two more years, with an option to renew the contract until the 2017 Rugby League World Cup."

        "text": "United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Company, 532 U.S. 200 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case that deals with the federal tax code. The question before the court was “Is back-pay subject to federal taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, based on the year the money should have been paid out?” The court held that wages are to be taxed on the year they were actually paid. Carter G. Phillips argued for the respondent and James A. Feldman argued for the petitioner, the Department of Justice.\nBackground.\nThe Cleveland Indians Baseball Company owed eight of its players back wages that were due in 1986 and fourteen players back wages that were due in 1987. The company paid the wages in 1994. The company paid taxes on the wages for the 1994 formula. The Company then requested that some of the taxes be refunded by the IRS under the argument that the taxes should be paid based on the year that they were supposed to be paid instead of the year they were actually paid. The taxes would have been significant because the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) which are used to fund Medicare, Social Security and Unemployment. The FICA and FUTA were both passed after 1987. The Cleveland Indians used Sixth Court precedent in its argument that late wages are taxed upon the year they should have paid. The District Court bound by precedent ordered the government to return the taxes. The Sixth Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s ruling.\nOpinion of the Court.\nUnlike the Sixth Court of Appeals the court had limited precedent in which to follow. Therefore, the court simply decided to use the IRS’s interpretation of the law. Justice Ginsburg, delivering the opinion of the court stated “according due respect to the service’s reasonable, longstanding construction of the governments statues and its own regulations, we hold that back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to the year the wages are in fact paid.”"

        "title": "Peter Wright (darts player)",
        "text": "Peter Stuart Wright (born 10 March 1970) is a Scottish professional darts player who plays in the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC), where he is currently ranked No. 8 in the world. Nicknamed \"Snakebite\", he is a two-time world champion, having won the PDC World Darts Championship in 2020 and 2022. He is also a World Matchplay champion and has been ranked as the World No. 1 in the PDC twice (both times occurring in 2022).\nWhen he was 24, Wright qualified for the first round of the 1995 BDO World Darts Championship, but then stopped playing darts professionally, working instead as a builder and tyre fitter while competing in local darts leagues. He resumed his professional darts career in his late 30s, playing his first full schedule of PDC events in 2008. He qualified for his first PDC World Darts Championship in 2010, entered the top 16 for the first time in 2013, and reached his first world final in 2014, where he was runner-up to Michael van Gerwen. He won his first major PDC title at the 2017 UK Open; as of March 2024, he has won 14 televised events, including 8 major titles. On the PDC Pro Tour he has won 33 events and has won 47 PDC titles overall. He has hit one televised nine-dart finish, at the 2020 Premier League Darts.\nKnown for his flamboyant stage persona, Wright typically wears colourful attire, multicoloured Mohican hairstyles created by his hairdresser wife Joanne, and elaborate designs painted on his head. He is known for performing a sidestep dance before his matches to the song \"Don't Stop the Party\" by Pitbull.\nEarly life, BDO, and beginnings of PDC career.\nBorn in Livingston, Scotland, to a 16-year-old single mother, Wright moved to London with his mother when he was three years old because she feared that her sisters would take her child away from her. Although he has lived in England ever since, he chooses to represent Scotland in sports. He stated that he first became interested in darts through watching players such as Cliff Lazerenko, Jocky Wilson, and Eric Bristow on TV in the early 1980s. He received a set of darts for his 13th birthday, but since his mother could not afford a dartboard, he initially threw them at trees. After some practice, he was able to beat his stepfather and his stepfather's friends. Within a few years, he was regarded as one of the most promising young players in London.\nWright competed at the 1995 BDO World Darts Championship, losing 3–1 in the first round to eventual champion Richie Burnett. He did not pursue a professional career afterward; instead, he worked as a builder and tyre fitter while playing in local darts leagues. He competed in the 2005 UK Open, where he lost 5–4 in the third round to Dave Smith. After he and his wife Joanne watched the inaugural Grand Slam of Darts on TV in 2007, and Wright mentioned that he had beaten some of the players who were competing in the event, Joanne encouraged him to pursue professional success in the sport. He first played a full schedule of Professional Darts Corporation events in 2008, although he had little success, winning just £1,200 in prize money.\nPDC.\n20092010.\n2009 proved to be a much better year for Wright as he made his PDC televised debut at the 2009 Las Vegas Desert Classic where he was defeated 6–3 by Colin Lloyd in the first round. His good form on the PDC Pro Tour, helped by a semi-final showing in the Las Vegas Players Championship, earned him qualification for the 2009 World Matchplay. Wright played Terry Jenkins in the first round and lost 10–4. Further quarter-final and semi-final runs followed in Players Championship events to qualify for his first PDC World Championship, where he lost 3–1 in sets to Michael van Gerwen in the opening round.\nIn 2010, Wright also made his debut in the Players Championship Finals and lost in the first round 6–2 against Wes Newton. In April, he reached his first final on the PDC tour at the sixth UK Open Qualifier where he lost 6–2 to Phil Taylor. Wright was knocked out in the third round of the UK Open 9–7 by William O'Connor.\n2011 season.\nWright won a match at the World Championship for the first time in 2011 by beating Co Stompé 3–1 and then saw off Paul Nicholson to face defending champion Phil Taylor in the third round. Wright lost 4–1 and averaged a very respectable 96.56. He enjoyed a good run at the UK Open which was ended in the last 16 by Mark Hylton and played in his second World Matchplay where Simon Whitlock beat him 10–7 in the first round. Wright's first quarter-final appearance in a major event came at the European Championship with victories over John Part and Gary Anderson, before losing again to Whitlock this time 10–6. His form continued by reaching the final of the 18th Players Championship of the year and a 6–2 loss to Anderson. Wright defeated Denis Ovens 6–4 in the opening round of the Players Championship Finals but lost 8–6 to Wes Newton in the subsequent round.\n2012 season.\nWright was unable to repeat his 2011 run in the 2012 edition of the World Championship, as he lost 3–1 to Jelle Klaasen in the first round. Wright missed 11 consecutive darts at doubles in the first two sets of the match. Wright represented Scotland with Gary Anderson in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts and together they were beaten by South Africa in the second round, losing in a sudden-death leg. Wright defeated Andy Brown and former world champions John Part and Richie Burnett to reach the last 16 of the UK Open where he played Raymond van Barneveld. Wright led 8–6 and was on a 138 finish on his throw to advance to the quarter-finals and beat the Dutchman for the first time. He hit treble 20 with his first dart and then single 18 to leave 60, meaning single 20 with his last dart would have left double top for the win when he returned to the board. However, Wright hit another treble 20 to bust his score and went on to lose the match 9–8.\nWright won his first PDC ranking title in October 2012, at the 15th Players Championship of the year in Killarney, Ireland, where he beat Robert Thornton 6–1 in the final with a 107 average. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Wright was 17th on the Order of Merit, comfortably inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He beat Colin Lloyd and Wayne Jones, before losing to Kim Huybrechts 10–6 in the quarter-finals.\n2013 season.\nAt the 2013 World Championship Wright saw off Arron Monk 3–0 in the first round to set up a meeting with the second favourite for the tournament, Michael van Gerwen, who Wright described as \"not good enough\" before the match. Wright won the first two sets, but van Gerwen won 12 of the next 14 legs to triumph 4–2. In the eight UK Open Qualifiers during the early part of 2013, Wright was a losing quarter-finalist twice and a losing semi-finalist three times to be placed fourth on the Order of Merit. It was at the UK Open where Wright reached his first major PDC semi-final. He had impressive victories over Gaz Cousins (9–4), BDO number one Stephen Bunting (9–2), Steve West (9–4) and Adrian Lewis (10–6). He played Phil Taylor in the semis and was beaten 5–10, with Wright stating afterwards that he had played the player instead of the dart board and was tensing up and snatching darts. He set himself a goal of reaching the top 16 in the world rankings by the end of the year. Later in the month, Wright won his second career ranking title at the fifth Players Championship. He averaged an incredible 118.66 in beating Gary Anderson 6–0 in ten minutes in the quarter-finals and then saw off Kevin Painter 6–3 in the semis and Wes Newton 6–1 in the final. He lost 6–4 to Colin Lloyd in the first round of the European Championship and 13–3 to Michael van Gerwen in the second round of the World Matchplay. Wright reached the final of the German Darts Championship, but lost 6–2 to Dave Chisnall. He also lost to Chisnall in the final of the next event, the seventh Players Championship, having beaten van Gerwen 6–2 in the semi-finals. He picked up another appearance in a final at the tenth event but lost 6–3 to Raymond van Barneveld. At the World Grand Prix he lost 2–0 in sets to Wes Newton in the first round, but after the event he moved into the world's top 16 for the first time. This earned him a spot in the first staging of the Masters, a tournament exclusively for the top 16 on the Order of Merit, where he was defeated 6–2 by Van Gerwen in the opening round.\n2014 season.\nWright advanced to the third round of the 2014 World Championship, where he faced Michael Smith who had knocked out Phil Taylor in the previous round. Wright produced his then highest televised averaged of 105.07 but at one point was 3–2 behind, before winning six of the next seven legs to reach the quarter-finals of the event for the first time in his career. He trailed 2–0 early on against Wes Newton but rallied to level with the match eventually going into a deciding set. Wright missed four match darts at two legs to none up but eventually edged the contest with a 121 finish on the bull to face Simon Whitlock in the semi-finals. He outplayed Whitlock from the start and maintained his high level by averaging over 100 for the second time in the event and win 6–2. Wright lost 12 of the first 14 legs in the final against number two seed Michael van Gerwen, before winning two unanswered sets and then missed one dart to trail just 4–3. He went on to be 6–2 behind and again won two sets in a row, but missed two chances to extend the match into a 12th set as he was beaten 7–4. The runner-up's cheque of £100,000 was the highest of his career at that point and he rose to world number seven. He was named the Most Improved Player and PDPA Player of the Year at the PDC's Annual Awards in January.\nWright's exploits earned him a place in the Premier League for the first time and he started the campaign very strongly with victories over the likes of Taylor (7–4), Adrian Lewis (7–1) and Whitlock (7–3) to be top of the table between weeks four and six. Despite three defeats in a row in the middle of the season, Wright was in the play-off places until week 13 and he then battled to a 6–6 draw with Taylor to ensure he would have a chance of progressing in the final round of league matches. However, after other results had not gone his way he was guaranteed to finish fifth in the table before he had played and he ended the season with a 7–5 defeat against Van Gerwen. Wright won his third title carrying ranking points of his career at the ninth Players Championship by beating Justin Pipe 6–2. At the Dubai Duty Free Darts Masters, Wright eliminated Taylor 10–5 and Dave Chisnall 11–8 to reach the final, where Van Gerwen was once again the victor as he defeated Wright 11–7. Wright played in his second World Cup of Darts this year and first with Robert Thornton and they progressed to the quarter-finals where they played Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan and Michael Mansell. Wright lost his singles match 4–2 to Dolan, but Thornton saw off Mansell to send the tie into a deciding doubles game which Scotland lost 4–1. At the European Darts Open, Wright averaged 111.29 whilst beating Michael Smith 6–1 in the second round and he went on to reach the final where he won his first European Tour title by defeating Simon Whitlock 6–2. He also advanced to the final of the last Players Championship of the year, but lost 6–5 to Gary Anderson.\n2015 season.\nWright had a largely trouble free passage into the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Championship as he dropped just one set in his opening three games. However, he was second best against Gary Anderson in a 5–1 defeat. A 9–1 victory over Raymond van Barneveld at the UK Open marked Wright's first ever win over the Dutchman with Wright going on to meet Phil Taylor in the quarter-finals. Wright won 10–6 after producing a match defining run to go from 5–4 behind to 9–5 ahead and broke down in tears in the post match interview. He recomposed himself to thrash Stephen Bunting 10–0 with an average of 105.10, over 20 points higher than his opponent's. However, a victory over a fifth world champion in the tournament proved a step too far as he couldn't quite reach the same heights in the final against Michael van Gerwen in an 11–5 defeat. A week later, Wright lost 6–5 to James Wade in the final of the second Players Championship event. On his return to Scotland, Wright recovered from 5–1 down to steal a point against Stephen Bunting in the Premier League, stretching his run to five matches unbeaten. However, four of those games were draws and Wright went into the ninth week of fixtures needing a win over Adrian Lewis to avoid being relegated from the competition, but he was beaten 7–4. Wright threw the first nine-dart finish of his career during his run to the final of the seventh Players Championship and won the title by defeating Wade 6–5 with an average of 110.14. He also won the 12th event by overcoming Jelle Klaasen 6–1 in the final. Wright and Anderson beat the Dutch duo of Van Gerwen and Van Barneveld in a doubles match in the semi-finals of the World Cup to ensure Scotland would reach their first final in the event. They played England's Taylor and Lewis and it went to the final singles game in which the winner of Wright against Lewis would win the title, with Lewis triumphing 4–1. In the inaugural Japan Darts Masters, Wright advanced to the final by edging past Van Gerwen 8–7 with a 141 finish. He was 7–2 down to Taylor, but then produced three ton-plus finishes during a five leg burst to level the match. However, Taylor was first to a double in the deciding leg to inflict Wright's fourth defeat in a televised final.\nWright reset his highest televised average to 108.13 whilst eliminating Kim Huybrechts 10–5 in the opening round of the World Matchplay. A pair of straight forward wins over Andrew Gilding and Gerwyn Price saw him reach the semi-finals of the event for the first time, but he lost 17–12 to Van Gerwen. Terry Jenkins defeated Wright 6–4 in the final of the 15th Players Championship. He led Kim Huybrechts 5–2 in the final of the European Darts Grand Prix, before losing four successive legs to be defeated 6–5, missing one championship dart in the process. Wright won his third Players Championship title of the year by edging Benito van de Pas 6–5 with all 11 legs going with the throw. He lost each of the first five legs to Van Gerwen in the semi-finals of the European Championship, but then pulled it back to 8–7 behind. However, Wright missed two darts at a single number to set up a double to level and went on to lose 11–7. The pair would meet once more in the final of the first World Series of Darts Finals and this time Wright lost the game's opening four legs, before moving 5–4 up. At 10–9 ahead and one leg away from the title, Wright hit a 180 to leave 90 only for Van Gerwen to take out 129 on the bull and, after Wright was unable to checkout 121 in the final leg, Van Gerwen finished 50 to complete an 11 dart leg and deny Wright his first televised title.\n2016 season.\nWright did not drop a set in reaching the third round of the 2016 World Championship and survived one match dart from Dave Chisnall to win 4–3. He missed one dart against Adrian Lewis to reduce his deficit to 4–3 in the quarter-finals and lost 5–2. Wright reached the final of the UK Open for the second year in a row and just like 12 months previously he faced Michael van Gerwen. He stayed with Van Gerwen early on by only trailing 5–3 and missed a dart for a nine-dart finish, but Wright would ultimately lose 11–4. A week later Wright won the first Players Championship of 2016 by recovering from 5–3 down to Lewis to triumph 6–5. At the end of March, Wright reached the final of the German Darts Masters losing 6–4 to Van Gerwen.\nWright missed out on a Premier League finals spot by two points. A subsequent fallout on social media between Wright's wife Jo, Adrian Lewis and members of the management team of Gary Anderson led Wright to withdraw from the Scottish World Cup of Darts team, for whom he had represented in the previous years final, and was replaced by Robert Thornton.\nWright returned to PDC major televised action by reaching the quarter-finals of the World Matchplay after impressive 10–5 and 11–6 wins over Joe Cullen and Ian White respectively, before losing narrowly 16–14 to Lewis. He was edged out 6–5 by Van Gerwen in the final of the European Darts Open and the pair met in a European Tour final for the third time this year at the European Darts Grand Prix, with the world number one triumphing once again this time 6–2. Wright lost 2–0 to Brendan Dolan in the first round of the World Grand Prix, but reached the semi-finals of the European Championship and was ousted 11–8 by Mensur Suljović.\nFrom 10–8 up in the semi-finals of the World Series of Darts Finals, Phil Taylor missed a total of seven match darts as Wright sneaked through to his seventh televised final and second in a row in this event 11–10. Once again Van Gerwen waited and Wright rallied from 10–6 to trail 10–9, but then missed five chances to level the game and was beaten 11–9. It was a similar story at the Grand Slam as Wright went 5–0 up on Taylor in the quarter-finals and knocked him out 16–10, missing a dart at double 12 for a nine darter along the way. In the semi-finals he lost to Van Gerwen for the 16th time in a row as the Dutchman averaged 111.17 to Wright's 102.13 in a 16–10 win. However, Wright, who so often changes his darts, stated that he had found a set he would be finally be staying with. Another semi-final exit followed at the Players Championship Finals as Dave Chisnall beat him 11–8.\n2017 season: First major title.\nWright averaged over 100 in each of his three matches at the 2017 World Championship leading up to a quarter-final meeting with James Wade in which he averaged even higher at 104.79. He closed out the match with a 134 finish to win 5–3 and move on to a semi-final against Gary Anderson. Wright battled to 3–3 having trailed 3–1, but lost nine of the final ten legs to be defeated 6–3. His current world ranking of three is the highest he has ever been. Wright won the first UK Open Qualifier of the year by beating Adrian Lewis 6–4 in the final and took the third event with a 6–5 win over Michael Smith in the final.\nHe made it three wins out of six events by defeating James Wade 6–3 in the final of the last qualifier to top the UK Open rankings.\nWright produced the second highest televised three-dart average of all-time of 119.50 in a 7–2 victory over Lewis in the fifth week of the Premier League. At the end of the same week he played in the UK Open, where he was the bookmakers' pre-tournament favourite due to his strong form and the absence of an injured van Gerwen. He defeated James Richardson, Dave Chisnall, and Rob Cross in the first two days of the tournament. From the quarter-final stage he beat Raymond van Barneveld 10–8 (with an average of 110.88) and Daryl Gurney 11–5 to play in the final of the event for the third year in a row. Wright raced into a 7–2 lead over Gerwyn Price and held on to claim his first major title with an 11–6 win. Wright won the German Darts Championship by overcoming Van Gerwen 6–3 in the final. It was his first victory over the world number one in a final after Wright had lost 10 in a row. He also added the German Darts Open to his growing collection of tournament wins after edging out Benito van de Pas 6–5 in the final by taking out a 121 finish with his opponent waiting on seven. He quickly made it a hat-trick of European Tour tournament wins this year when he whitewashed Van Gerwen 6–0 in the final of the European Darts Grand Prix.\nWright came close to topping the Premier League table as he finished a point behind Van Gerwen. Nevertheless, he qualified for the play-offs for the first time and was 4–0 ahead of Taylor in the semi-finals. Wright still had to rely on Taylor missing darts at doubles including one to win the match and edged through 10–9. He also had a fast start in the final to be 7–2 up on Van Gerwen, before being pegged back to 8–8. At 10–9 Wright was one leg away from winning. He left 32 after nine darts, before missing six darts for the title. Wright still had the throw in the next leg, but Van Gerwen had a 12-dart leg to break and win 11–10. Despite this disappointment, two days later Wright won the 11th Players Championship by overcoming Daryl Gurney 6–3. Wright and Gary Anderson suffered a surprise first round 5–2 defeat to Singapore at the World Cup.\nWright reached the finals of the 2017 World Matchplay and the 2017 Grand Slam of Darts losing to Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen respectively. He won his first title on the World Series of Darts at the 2017 German Darts Masters, beating Taylor 11–4 in the final.\n2018 season.\nWright had an early exit in the 2018 World Championship, losing to Jamie Lewis in the second round. He only finished 7th in the 2018 Premier League Darts, but turned his season round by reaching the final of the 2018 PDC World Cup of Darts, alongside Gary Anderson, losing to the Netherlands team.\nWright followed his World Cup final appearance with a semi-final place at the 2018 World Matchplay and a win at the 2018 Melbourne Darts Masters. He also reached the finals of the 2018 World Grand Prix and the 2018 Champions League of Darts, losing to Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson respectively.\n2019 season: World Cup Champion.\nAt the 2019 World Championship, Wright again suffered an early exit, losing 3–1 to Spaniard Toni Alcinas in the second round. He finished the 2019 Premier League Darts season in 8th, only beating Raymond van Barneveld and contender Steve Lennon over the season. The Scotland team of Wright and Gary Anderson won the 2019 PDC World Cup of Darts, beating Ireland in the final. Wright subsequently won the 2019 German Darts Masters, beating Gabriel Clemens in the final.\nWright made the final of the 2019 Champions League of Darts, and at one point led the first-of-eleven match against Michael van Gerwen 10–7, but he missed three match darts and allowed Van Gerwen to win 11–10. Wright also made the final of the 2019 Grand Slam of Darts, losing 16–6 to reigning champion Gerwyn Price.\n2020 season: World, Masters and European Champion.\nAt the 2020 World Championship Wright survived a match dart at bullseye to win a sudden-death leg against Noel Malicdem in the second round, before beating Seigo Asada and Jeffrey de Zwaan to reach the quarter-finals, where he triumphed 5–3 over Luke Humphries to reach the semi-final for the first time since the 2017 tournament. In a bad-tempered affair, Wright defeated Gerwyn Price 6–3 in the semi-final and defeated Michael van Gerwen 7–3 in the final to become the 2020 World Darts Champion at the age of 49. On 2 February Wright beat Michael Smith 11–10 to win his first Masters title. In November, Wright won his 4th major by beating James Wade 11–4 in the final of the European Championship. Wright had a poor showing at the Grand Slam, failing to progress from the group stage after a 2–5 loss to Devon Petersen in his final match, later stating \"When I lost to Devon I could have walked away from the sport quite easily.\" Wright had better luck the following week with a run to the semi-finals of the Players Championship Finals making him just the third player in history (after Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor) to exceed £1,000,000 on the PDC Order of Merit.\n2021 season: World Matchplay Champion and Players Championship Finals winner.\nWright kicked off the defence of his world title by beating Steve West in his opening match of the 2021 World Championship, dressed in a Grinch costume. His reign as world champion came to an end in the third round, when he was defeated 4–3 by Gabriel Clemens.\nIn July, Wright won the World Matchplay title for the first time with a dominance performance whereby he won all five of his matches by a minimum of six legs and averaged over 100 throughout. He defeated Danny Noppert, Joe Cullen, Michael Smith, Michael van Gerwen and finally defending champion Dimitri van den Bergh. He followed this up with a second world cup win for Scotland, this time partnering John Henderson. A dry period including a first round loss to Rob Cross at the Grand Prix ended with a third Grand Slam of Darts final, beating Jose de Sousa, Fallon Sherrock and Michael Smith in the knockout rounds (the latter being a 16–12 win from 8–12 behind) before once again losing to Gerwyn Price. The following week, Wright won his first Players Championship Finals title, following comfortable wins over van Gerwen and Jonny Clayton with a deciding leg victory over Ryan Searle in the final. This completed Wright's set of reaching the final of every active PDC major and was his fifth win in two years.\n2022 season: Second World Championship, World Number 1.\nWright started his 2022 World Championship campaign with a convincing 3–0 win against Ryan Meikle, before fighting back from 2–0 down to defeat Damon Heta 4–2 in the third round. He next beat Ryan Searle 4–1, before coming back from 4–3 down to beat Callan Rydz in extra legs to make the semi-final. There he beat Gary Anderson 6–4 to reach the final for the third time in his career. Wright defeated Michael Smith 7–5 in the final to win his second world title. In the Masters, Wright suffered an early exit, losing 10-8 to Simon Whitlock in the round of 16. In the UK Open, he defeated Joe Cullen 10-6 in the fourth round before convincingly beating Simon Whitlock 10-5. However, his tournament would come to an end after losing 10-7 to William O'Connor after many missed doubles. On the 7th of March, Wright became the PDC World Number 1 for the first time, becoming the 11th player to do so and the oldest ever first time world number 1 at 51 years old. In the Premier League, Wright would finish 5th in the league table, meaning he did not qualify for the play-offs after only winning 1 night in the league stage. In the World Cup of Darts, alongside John Henderson, the pair defeated Hong Kong 5-1 in the opening round, before overcoming Portugal 2-0 in the round of 16, with Wright himself scraping past José de Sousa 4-3 to secure the victory, although Scotland would go on to lose 2-0 to England in the quarter-finals, with Wright himself losing 4-1 to James Wade. On 13 November, Peter's wife, Joanne, was rushed to hospital, following complications from surgery to remove her gallbladder and a hysterectomy. \nFollowing the conclusion of the Grand Slam of Darts tournament, Wright withdrew from the Players Championship Finals, in order to be with his wife.\nWright announced that Jo was left in severe pain, suffered a collapsed lung, which was apparently caused by a slit in the bile duct, which was causing fluid to leak, and her health deteriorated, following the surgery.\nShe spent 13 days in hospital, before finally being discharged on 26 November.\nHowever, less than 2 days later, Wright announced on his Twitter page, that she had been taken into hospital again, and were awaiting to be admitted to a ward.\n2023: Second European Championship title.\nAt the 2023 World Championship, Wright opened his world title defence with a 3–0 win over Mickey Mansell. His reign ended when he lost 4–1 to Kim Huybrechts in the third round. On the 12 January, in the inaugural Bahrain Darts Masters, he defeated Toru Suzuki 6–3 in the opening round, before losing a last-leg decider to Rob Cross in the quarter-finals, but the next week he went on to win the Nordic Darts Masters for the first time beating Gerwyn Price in the final 11–5.\nAt the European Championship, Wright beat James Wade to win his second European darts title.\n2024.\nAt the 2024 World Championship, Wright suffered a shock 3–0 second round loss to Jim Williams.\nStyle and stage persona.\nWright has become known for his colourful Mohican hairstyle and extravagant clothing which change between every round of his tournaments. His hair takes two hours to complete and is done by his hairdresser wife Joanne and inspired by their daughter. He usually has a snake painted on to the side of his head which many believed was reference to his favourite drink, the snakebite, which is also Wright's nickname. However, he is actually called Snakebite due to his love of snakes, stating in an interview after his first World Championship win, \"I just like snakes. I'm a bit like a snake – I'm a quiet person who likes to be left alone. If you keep poking me, I'll bite you,\" he said.\nWright equates his look to applying war paint before going into battle, as he is naturally shy away from the oche. In the past he has used specially designed darts which changed colour depending on the light. Wright is known to regularly try different sets of darts as he tweaks the weight, flights and stems. He did so between every round when he reached the 2014 World Championship final.\nWright performs a sidestep dance across the whole stage to Pitbull's \"Don't Stop the Party\" at the beginning of his matches. He regularly pauses on the third dart of leg winning doubles and moves away from the oche to encourage the crowd to make more noise upon his return. In a Premier League match he bent his knees to lower his height by about a foot to throw an exhibition dart. Such acts of showmanship have created negative reactions among his fellow professionals with world champions Adrian Lewis and Michael van Gerwen calling it disrespectful. Wright has stated that his job is to entertain spectators and would continue playing in the same manner.\nPerformance timeline.\nBDO\nPDC\nPDC European Tour"

Its home venue was Bourne Paddock. Bourne was patronised by Sir Horatio Mann, owner of the Bourne Park House estate, and was in reality his own private club. When Sir Horatio relocated to Dandelion, near Margate, the Bourne club ceased to exist.\nHistory.\nBourne is first recorded as a cricket team on Monday 29 September 1766 when it played Dartford at Bishopsbourne. Details of the match, including the result, are unknown.\nBourne played Surrey at Bishopsbourne in August 1767 and again in August 1768. Earlier in the 1768 season, Bourne played three matches against Henry Rowett's Caterham Cricket Club. The last match in which the Bourne club is named as a participant is Bourne v. Middlesex &amp; Surrey at Bishopsbourne in August 1771, the combined team winning by a single run.\nSir Horatio continued to raise his own team for many years and Bourne Paddock was a regular venue for major matches until 1790. It is no longer in use as a cricket ground. A modern cricket club, Bishopsbourne Cricket Club, played matches on a ground at Charlton Park to the south of Bourne Park. This ground is still in use."

        "title": "John Cranston (American football)",
        "text": "John Samuel Cranston (November 18, 1865 – December 17, 1931) was an American football player and coach. He played for Harvard University from 1888 to 1890. He was selected as an All-American in 1889 and 1890—the first years in which College Football All-America Teams were selected. He was also the first football player to wear protective \"nose armor\", which was invented by a Harvard teammate to protect his \"weak nose\". He later served as a football coach at Harvard from 1893 to 1903. During the 1905 football reform movement, Cranston was part of the reformist camp and proposed the abolition of professional coaches.\nBiography.\nFootball player.\nA native of Sheridan, New York, Cranston began his football career at Phillips Exeter Academy in 1887. As a freshman in November 1888, he began playing center after a knee injury to Harvard's starting center, Findlay. In 1889, a Pennsylvania newspaper described Cranston as \"a capital center rusher and snapper back.\" \"The World\" of New York called Cranston one of Harvard's best men, and experienced player who was \"as strong as a bull.\" Cranston was selected as a guard on the first College Football All-American Team selected by Caspar Whitney in 1889.\nIn 1890, a newspaper reported that \"the former invincible Cranston\" was not playing to the level he had in 1889 -- \"The old men, instead of improving with age, are rather deteriorating in the quality of their play.\" \"The New York Tribune\" offered a more positive take on Cranston in November 1890:\"John Cranston, the Crimson's center rusher, is one of the oldest and strongest men on either team. He has played four years on the Harvard team, becoming center rusher in his freshman year. He played a right guard in the two following years, but returned to his old place, because there was no one else to fill the old place. Cranston is aggressive and active and always gives his opponent a great deal of work.\" The \"Springfield Republican\" wrote that Cranston was not a great blocker and \"is rather pugnacious and wastes time splitting heads; but he is a strong, heavy man, and will do his part very nearly as it ought to be done.\" At the end of the 1890 season, Cranston was again selected for on the College Football All-America Team, this time as the center. In 1891, \"The New York Times\" reported that Cranston had left Harvard:\"Cranston is another man who will be missed. Year before last he played in the center but last year he was the left guard. Late in the Spring Cranston withdrew from college, and in all probability will not enter Harvard again. Although his game last year was not up to his usual standard, he was an extremely valuable man.\"\nFirst player to wear \"nose armor\".\nCranston was also noteworthy as the first player to wear equipment to protect his face during an American football game. Football was a brutal game that resulted in many serious injuries and deaths in the 19th century, prior to modern innovations of helmets and padding. Though he was an excellent football player, Cranston was known to have \"a weak nose.\" In order to protect Cranston's nose, and to allow him to play on Harvard's football team, Harvard's captain Arthur Cumnock invented a device that he called \"nose armor.\" Cumnock's invention gained popularity, and in 1892, a newspaper article described the growing popularity of the device:\"By the invention of nose armor football players who have been hitherto barred from the field because of broken or weak noses are now able to thrust an armor protected nose (even though it be broken) into the center of the roughest scrimmage without danger to the sensitive nasal organ. The armor is made of fine rubber and protects both the nose and teeth.\"\nHarvard crew and coaching.\nCranston also rowed with Harvard's crew. Cranston returned to Harvard as an assistant football coach in 1893 and became one of the leading coaches at the school over the next several years, helping William H. Lewis develop the centers. In March 1903, Cranston was appointed as Harvard's head football coach. At the time of his appointment, the \"Boston Morning Journal\" summarized his accomplishments as follows:\"John Cranston played at Harvard in 1888, 1889 and 1890, two years as centre and one as guard on the 'varsity team. In his freshman year he rowed on the 'varsity crew, and before entering college played four years of football at Exeter. He stands as the best center Harvard ever boasted, and his long experience in football, and his past coaching, coupled with remarkable business ability, should work wonders with the Crimson candidates when they report for the eleven next September.\"\nCranston took over as head coach after Harvard lost to Yale, 23–0, in 1902. He told reporters that Harvard's prospect were not good, and the team would have to work hard, and talk less, if it were to rebound. Cranston said the team had the 23-0 score from the prior year \"printed right on the seats of our trousers.\"\nIn 1905, college football was struck by scandals involving professionalism, as some schools were accused of hiring \"ringers,\" and also by concerns over the sport's brutality and injuries. Cranston sided with the reformers and published an article in the \"Boston Journal\" advocating that universities ban the use of professional coaches and require that only university undergraduates may be involved in coaching. The proposal was endorsed by the reform movement, though Harvard's long-time assistant coach William H. Lewis rejected the proposal. Lewis argued that Cranston's undergraduate coaching system would result in \"the blind leading the blind,\" and suggested that universities might then also consider doing away with professors and tutors, leaving college students to go to school and \"dig for themselves.\"\nCranston drew further attention in late 1905 when he published a further article in the \"Boston Journal\" opining that athletics were being overdone at universities. Under the headline, \"Wishes He Had Not Been a Famous Athlete When In College,\" Cranston wrote:\"I have had several serious sicknesses since I left college which I attribute to the great strain of my athletic training. On the whole I can't say that athletics have benefitted me any in my business career. I sincerely believe I would have been better off in my life since college if I had left athletics alone. ... I've never received any benefit in business life from athletics. I am not a broken down man by any means, but I only speak the truth when I say I should have been better off had I left athletics alone.\""

He has previously played for the Buffalo Sabres, Winnipeg Jets, New Jersey Devils, Edmonton Oilers, Minnesota Wild, Anaheim Ducks and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nKulikov began his career in his homeland Russia with Lokomotiv-2 Yaroslavl in the Pervaya Liga, and left his club in November 2008 to sign for the Drummondville Voltigeurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) in North America. In his lone season with Drummondville, Kulikov led all QMJHL defencemen with 62 points in 57 games, and took home a slew of post-season awards, including the Emile Bouchard Trophy as the QMJHL Defenceman of the Year, the Raymond Lagacé Trophy as the Defensive Rookie of the Year and the Mike Bossy Trophy as the League's top professional prospect.\nProfessional.\nAfter his rookie year with the Voltigeurs, Kulikov was drafted by the Florida Panthers 14th overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, and was later signed to a professional contract the club on 29 September 2009.\nDespite his age, Kulikov managed to play in 68 games with Florida in his rookie season, 2009–10, displaying high levels of skill and confidence. Panthers General Manager Dale Tallon expressed that the Panthers organization had high expectations of Kulikov for the future.\nOn 18 July 2014, Kulikov signed a three-year, $13 million contract extension with the Panthers, worth $4.3 million annually.\nOn 25 June 2016, Kulikov was traded to the Buffalo Sabres, along with the 33rd overall pick in the 2016 NHL Draft in exchange for defenceman Mark Pysyk and picks 38 and 89 in the 2016 draft. In the 2016–17 season, Kulikov's time with the Sabres was largely affected through injury. In the last year of his contract, he appeared in 47 games to produce a career low 2 goals and 5 points.\nOn 1 July 2017, as a free agent from his disappointing tenure with the Sabres, Kulikov was signed to a three-year, $12 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets.\nAfter the completion of his contract with the Jets, Kulikov left as a free agent and on 22 October 2020, he was signed to a one-year, $1.15 million contract with the New Jersey Devils. In the pandemic delayed 2020–21 season, Kulikov brought a sound defensive game to the Devils, registering 2 assists through 38 regular season games. With the Devils out of playoff contention, Kulikov was dealt at the trade deadline to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a conditional fourth-round selection in 2022 on 12 April 2021.\nAt the conclusion of his contract with the Oilers, Kulikov left as a free agent and on 28 July 2021, was signed to a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Minnesota Wild.\nAfter one season with the Wild, Kulikov was traded to the Anaheim Ducks for future considerations on 31 August 2022.\nOn 3 March 2023, the Ducks traded Kulikov to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Brock McGinn and a third-round pick in the 2024 NHL Entry Draft.\nAs a free agent from the Penguins, Kulikov opted to return to his original club after seven seasons away, signing a one-year, $1 million contract with the Florida Panthers for the season on 1 July 2023.\nInternational play.\nKulikov represented Russia in two Under-18 World Cups: 2007 in Finland and 2008 in Russia. He was then a member of Team Russia at the 2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships."

He played college football at Louisiana State University.\nEarly years.\nScott was born in Tampa, Florida to Charles and Phyllis Scott. He grew up on Air Force bases, and he earned the nickname \"Junior\" by his father.\nScott attended to Jonesboro-Hodge High School where he was an All-district performer in baseball, basketball and football. Scott was the Consensus top running back prospect in the state of Louisiana and one of the most highly recruited in the nation, he was named by Scout.com the tenth-best at the running back position and eighth by Rivals.com. He was named State of Louisiana Gatorade Player of the Year.\nCollege career.\nScott committed to Louisiana State University in 2006. He made his first collegiate start against Mississippi State and scored two touchdowns. Scott recorded his first career 100-yard rushing game against the Tulane Green Wave, gaining 101 yards and scoring two touchdowns on 15 carries. With his performance against Tulane, he became the quickest true freshman to 100 yards since Kevin Faulk did so in the second game of his career in the 1995 season.\nIn the 2007 season, at the season opener against Mississippi State, Scott had his first career receiving touchdown from quarterback Matt Flynn. He had a minor role on the Tigers' route to the National Championship, finishing the season with 324 yards on 45 carries for five touchdowns, 7.2 yards per carry and 115 receiving yards on 12 catches and two touchdowns.\nIn the 2008 season-opener against Appalachian State, Scott ran for a 56-yard run, the first touchdown of the season for the Tigers. He also rushed for a career-best 160 yards and two touchdowns in the game. His 160 rushing yards were the most by an LSU player since Alley Broussard broke the school record with 250 yards against Ole Miss Rebels in 2004. At the week 3 match-up against the Auburn Tigers, his 21-carry, 132-yard performance marked the first 100-yard rusher for LSU at Jordan–Hare Stadium in the school's history. Scott became the first LSU running back to rush for three consecutive 100-yard games since Joseph Addai in 2005. After his performance against Auburn, he was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week and \"National Player of the Week\" by Rivals.com. Against Mississippi State, Scott became the first LSU player to record four straight 100-yard rushing games since Justin Vincent did so in the final four games of the 2003 season and the school's first player to open a season with four straight 100-yard rushing games since former All-American Charles Alexander. At the end of the season, he finished the regular season with 202 carries for a career-high 1,109 yards and 15 touchdowns to lead the Tigers in rushing, and his 5.5 yards per carry average ranks third in school history for a single season, moving into a tie for third place for LSU single-season rushing touchdowns with 15.\nScott earned first-team All-SEC Coaches honors and second-team All-SEC honors by the \"Associated Press\".\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nScott was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round (200th overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed to a four-year, $1.88 million contract on June 2, 2010.\nArizona Cardinals.\nScott was traded to the Arizona Cardinals in exchange for 2010 sixth-round draft pick Jorrick Calvin on August 30, 2010. He was waived on September 3, but re-signed to the team's practice squad on September 4.\nNew York Giants.\nScott was signed by the New York Giants from the Cardinals' practice squad on September 6, 2010.

Organized by the \"South American Volleyball Confederation (CSV)\", this championship served as a platform for countries in the region to showcase their talent, compete at a high level, and vie for the prestigious title.\nAs part of the broader landscape of international volleyball competitions, events like the South American Championship often play a crucial role as qualifiers for global tournaments, such as the FIVB Volleyball World Championship. Participating nations put forth their top athletes and finest teams to engage in intense and competitive matches.\nThe tournament format typically involves a series of matches between the participating countries, with round-robin stages leading to knockout rounds. Teams battle it out on the volleyball court, demonstrating their skills, teamwork, and strategic prowess in pursuit of victory. Beyond the competitive aspect, these championships foster camaraderie and sportsmanship among the nations involved.\nWhile specific details about the 1987 edition, such as the participating teams, match outcomes, and standout performances, would require consulting historical sports archives, official CSV records, or dedicated volleyball databases, it's reasonable to assume that the tournament featured thrilling moments and showcased the high level of volleyball expertise present in the South American region during that period.\n\"For enthusiasts and historians interested in delving deeper into the specifics\" of the 1987 Men's South American Volleyball Championship, exploring resources such as sports federations' archives, libraries, or online databases dedicated to volleyball history would likely yield a wealth of information, helping to paint a more comprehensive picture of this particular chapter in the region's volleyball legacy."

The Test match, which was for the Women's Ashes, was drawn; ensuring that England retained them.\nBuild-up.\nPrior to the series, both sides took part in the 2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20, which was also held in England in June. England won the tournament, in the process beating Australia by 8 wickets in the second semi-final. The semi-final defeat was Karen Rolton's final game as captain of the Australian side, having announced before the tournament she would be standing down. Jodie Fields was announced as the new captain for the tour of England, with Alex Blackwell as her deputy.\nMatches.\nTwenty20 International.\nThe Twenty20 International between the two sides was played as the first part of a doubleheader at Derby; with Derbyshire's match against Lancashire providing the second half of the entertainment. Australia batted first having won the toss, and recorded a \"competitive\" total of 151 for 3 from their allocation of 20 overs. Leah Poulton and Shelley Nitschke compiled 55 for the first wicket, a partnership that was described as \"momentum-seizing\", before Karen Rolton contributed an unbeaten 43 and Lauren Ebsary a 13-ball 24.\nEngland, who had rested bowler Katherine Brunt and batsman Caroline Atkins from the side that had won the World Twenty20 tournament, found their response stifled by Australia's opening bowlers Sarah Andrews and Rene Farrell. The pair accounted for both openers while maintaining an economy rate no higher than five. Claire Taylor, Beth Morgan and Lydia Greenway all briefly threatened, before England's innings closed on 117 for 6.\nShelley Nitschke was awarded the player of the match award, having scored 32 while opening the batting and taking the wicket of Morgan in her economical four-over spell of bowling.\nOne Day Internationals.\nEngland began the One Day International series the strongest, defeating Australia by nine wickets in the first of two ODIs at the County Ground in Chelmsford. Led by vice-captain Nicki Shaw after Charlotte Edwards had fallen ill, England took two quick wickets after being made to field first. Katherine Brunt, returning to the side after missing the Twenty20 International, had Shelley Nitschke caught off of the first delivery of the match, before making Lisa Sthalekar edge the ball to wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor to leave Australia 4 for 2 after the first over.\nEngland's bowlers were rotated regularly, with the introduction of Holly Colvin into the attack proving key. Colvin removed Leah Poulton with a flighted delivery lofted to long on and Ellyse Perry, who was stumped by Taylor to leave Australia 42 for 6. Lauren Ebsary and Rene Farrell helped Australia avoid their lowest-ever total in ODIs by adding 30 for the eighth wicket, before Farrell and Sarah Andrews added a national–record 36 for the final wicket to get Australia to an all out total of 133.\nEngland, by contrast, batted more competently than the Australians, with Taylor and Caroline Atkins barely offering a chance as they moved towards the target of 134. Jodie Fields rotated her bowlers, but the Australian spin bowlers were comfortably played by England. Taylor brought up a half-century in exactly an hour, having faced 55 balls and hit 6 fours, before she was dismissed playing \"a loose slog\" with England still requiring 15 to win. Her namesake, Claire Taylor, helped Atkins to reach the victory target off the last ball of the 27th over.\nTest match.\nDay 1: Australia won the toss and elected to bat first, quickly lost 5 wickets for 28 runs (Brunt took 4 of these wickets), but Jodie Fields scored 139 runs (her first century) and together with Rachael Haynes broke the record by the sixth partnership with 199 runs. Australia closed the day with 271 for 7, and Katherine Brunt took 5 for 55.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 2: Australia only added 38 runs and closed the Innings in 309 runs. England lost their first 4 wickets for 28 runs, and closed the day with 116 runs for 5 wickets, trail by 203 runs.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 3: England fell with 268 runs, and Beth Morgan scored 58 runs (her first half century). Australia scored 128 for 1, with Alex Blackwell scored 59 runs (her second half-century), and leading by 169 runs. Karen Rolton scored her run 1,000th (1st Australian, and 10th All-time)&lt;br&gt;\nDay 4: With England need a draw, Australia fell with 231 runs (272 ahead) on the second session. England only scored 103 runs, but survived the day and secured the draw, retaining the Ashes. Charlotte Edwards scored 53 runs unbeaten (her 8th half century)."

        "text": "Anthony Alexander Shaw is an Australian former rugby union player. A Queensland state and national representative flanker, Shaw captained the national side consistently from 1978 to 1982.\nEarly life and style.\nTony Shaw was born 23 March 1953 in Brisbane, Queensland. His early rugby was played at St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace in Brisbane. He was a proficient water-polo player and represented for Queensland in that sport.\nShaw's greatest rugby success was achieved at flanker, he was a hard driving forward who lead from the front and was an outstanding rucker and mauler. Howell asserts that although the standard of Australian representative sides during the early 1970s was less than consistently world-class, Shaw would have been competitive in the best All Black packs of that and any other era. Howell regards him as a cunning line-out technician who could outwit taller and more spring-heeled opponents. Queensland packs containing Shaw and Mark Loane dominated their New South Wales rivals in the late 1970s.\nRugby career.\nShaw was first selected for Queensland when Tonga visited in 1973. That year, aged 20 he was picked for the 1973 Australia rugby union tour of Europe and he played in the second-row in five games including his debut Test appearances against Wales and England.\nEarly in his career Shaw played at number-eight and although he was picked in the Queensland team of 1974 against the visiting All Blacks, Mark Loane was preferred by the selectors at number 8 for the three Test matches against those visitors. Shaw set out at that point to become the first-choice flanker in the national side. In 1975 he was back in the Australian team at breakaway for two domestic Tests against England and one against Japan. He made the 1975–76 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland and played in nineteen of the total twenty-six matches. He was the only back-rower to play in all five Test matches of the tour.\nIn 1976 he played against Fiji for Australia in three Tests. Wearing a Queensland jumper he also met Fiji and in that year's interstate series the Reds dominated New South Wales with a 42–4 victory. He made the 1976 Australia rugby union tour of Europe and played in eight of the ten games including the two Test losses to France. Coach Bob Templeton's tenure and the reputation of a number of senior players suffered as a result of the poor tour record but Shaw held his own and returned well regarded.\nThe new national coach Daryl Haberecht, in 1978 built his side around the leadership strength of Shaw and his Queensland back star Paul McLean. Shaw wasn't even the captain at his club side Brisbane Brothers and Mark Loane was the state captain but Haberecht valued Shaw's \"blood &amp; thunder\" leadership style and Shaw debuted as national captain in two Tests against Wales, both won. The Wallaby forwards in those Tests were a pack of \"hard-heads\" who gave no quarter to the Welsh. They were Shaw, Loane, Greg Cornelsen, Garrick Fay, David Hillhouse, Stan Pilecki and Steve Finnane. Finnane was attributed with breaking Welsh prop Graham Price's jaw, in the brutal second Test.\nShaw was the squad and Test captain on the 1978 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand on which coach Haberecht suffered a heart attack after the 2nd Test 6–22 loss. A mid-game rallying speech from Shaw inspired the Wallabies to a form turnaround that saw them win the 3rd Test in Auckland 30–16. In 1979 under new coach Dave Brockhoff, Loane led the Wallabies in a Test match in Sydney where they won the Bledisloe Cup for the first time in 45 years; Shaw played in that game. Shaw led Queensland in matches against Ireland and the NZ Maori, and played in two Tests against Ireland under Loane. Loane also led the Wallabies on the 1979 Australia rugby union tour of Argentina but Shaw played in six of the seven matches and captained Australia in a mid-week game.\nIn 1980 under Shaw's leadership the Wallabies won two of a three Test home series against the All Blacks and retained the Bledisloe Cup. Australian had further success under Shaw's leadership on a tour of Fiji that same year and hosting France in 1981 – all Tests were won. Shaw was selected to captain the Wallabies on the 1981–82 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland becoming the first Queenslander to captain the Wallabies on a tour of the Home Nations since his future father-in-law Bill McLean in 1947–48. Shaw would later marry McLean's daughter and made the 81–82 tour alongside Bill's son Peter and nephew Paul. Disaster struck for Shaw in the Test against Scotland when he retaliated recklessly to niggling from Scots player Bill Cuthbertson with a king-hit right in front of the referee and the TV cameras. This transgression would mark the end of Shaw's Test captaincy career. He was also dropped from the team following the Scottish Test.\nShaw played again for his country against Scotland in 1982 and against Argentina in 1983 but his rugby career ended in 1983 at age 31 following an appearance for the Queensland B team against the All Blacks. In total, Shaw played thirty-six tests for the Wallabies between 1973 and 1982. He made a further forty-eight tour match appearances including some matches as a lock or number eight. He captained the Aussies for fifteen Tests and a further fourteen international tour matches. He is Australian cap number 565. Howell regards Shaw and one of the greatest captains Australia has ever had.\nAccolades.\nShaw was inducted into the Wallaby Hall of Fame in 2012 and was named as an Australian Rugby Union Classic Statesman that same year."

        "text": "Rugby union in Mexico is a minor but growing sport. Rugby union has a stronger following in Mexico with French communities.\nThe Mexican Rugby Federation () is the body directing rugby union in Mexico. It has the responsibility of organising and developing rugby in the country.\nRugby in Mexico comprises 800 players and twenty clubs. Rugby in Mexico is purely amateur, lacking structure and funding. There is no rugby culture and even a regional or local solid foundation.\nHistory.\nRugby union was introduced in Mexico for the first time around 1930 by British oil workers. The teams were essentially made up of foreign players. Following the nationalisation of the Mexican oil industry the British left the country and rugby disappeared. In 1971 another Briton, Mr. Walter Irvine, again introduced rugby into the Reformed Athletic Club, an association of British origin.\nWalter Irvine founded \"Unión Mexicana de Rugby A.C.\" in 1973 to organise and develop rugby union in Mexico. The \"UMR\" was the body directing Mexican rugby union until October 2003 when the Federación Mexicana de Rugby (FMR) was founded. In November of that year the FMR was made an associate member of the International Rugby Board. Mexico could thus take part in competitions organised by the supreme authority of rugby on a world level. The FMRU organises rugby in the country: a championship takes place at the highest level in the country, and in the same way organises a championships for youth, veterans and women.\nAt the beginning of 2007, the Mexican Olympic committee recognized the FMR as an affiliate member. The federation of Mexico is a fully affiliated member of the IRB.\nNational team.\nOn October the 25th 2007, the Mexican national rugby union team, nicknamed ´Los Serpientes´ (The Snakes), played three unofficial matches, winning one, losing one and drawing the other. The IRB did not recognise these meetings as the administrative checks to ensure that the players were eligible to represent Mexico were not made.\nTheir first official test match, in March 2008, was a 47-7 victory over Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national team in Rugby World Cup 2011 qualifying. They were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Barbados, by a score of 21-20. Their overall record however was 2-2, finishing 6th place in Round 1A of the Americas qualification zone after defeating hosts the Cayman Islands 13-6 then losing 23-17 to the Bahamas.\nMajor League Championship.\nThe Major League championship of 2006-7 had the following eleven teams competing:\nBetween 2011 and 2012 a new team was formed by young players, called:\nAfter their first year they won the ascension match, getting themselves the entrance to the Major League."

The club has two 18-hole courses: the Championship Course and the Struie Course. The older Championship Course is a links course located on the Dornoch Firth.\nRoyal Dornoch has never hosted any of the modern professional tournaments. The British Amateur Championship was held there in 1985 and the Scottish Amateur in 1993, 2000, and 2012. The Women's and Men's Senior Amateur championships will be held at Royal Dornoch in 2022.\nThe Championship Course was ranked No. 3 on the 2007 \"Golf Digest\" list of Top 100 International (outside U.S.) courses. David Brice, of \"Golf International\", called it the \"king of Scottish links courses\".\nThe internationally renowned Championship Course at Royal Dornoch Golf Club was named No. 1 in the world by the online golf reservation service golfscape and is widely regarded as one of the world's finest links golf courses.\nHistory.\nGolf was played in Dornoch, over the extensive linksland there, in the early seventeenth century, circa 1616. Expenses covering the cost of a young aristocrat's golf clubs in 1616 have provided the earliest evidence so far of the sport's presence in Dornoch. John, the 13th Earl of Sutherland, was sent to the town in Sutherland to be educated. The reference was uncovered by researcher Wade Cormack, who is a PhD student at the University of the Highlands and Islands. The current golf club was established in 1877, and was awarded its royal status in 1906 by King Edward VII. \nThe design of the Championship Course is attributed to Old Tom Morris. Several of the original holes were lost to the construction of an airfield during World War II. After the war, George Duncan was commissioned to restore and extend the course over newly acquired land. The work introduced the present 6th through 11th holes on the Championship Course.\nTom Watson is an honorary member of Royal Dornoch, and is quoted as saying of Dornoch: \"It's the most fun I've ever had on a golf course\" which was the home of the course architect Donald Ross.\nMembers of the club traveled to the northwest United States in September 2005 for a friendly international competition and cultural exchange with the Coeur d'Alene Tribe at their Circling Raven Golf Club in northern Idaho."

        "text": "William Castle Rhodes (July 5, 1869 – February 5, 1914) was American football player and coach. Rhodes played tackle at Yale University from 1887 to 1890 and was selected for the 1890 College Football All-America Team. After playing for the Cleveland Athletic Club and coaching at Western Reserve in 1891, Rhodes return to his alma mater to serve as head coach for the Yale Bulldogs football team in 1893 and 1894, compiling a record of 26–1. Rhodes' 1894 team won all 16 of its games and was later recognized as a national champion by a number of selectors.\nFootball player at Yale.\nA native of Cleveland, Ohio, Rhodes went east to enroll at Yale University. At Yale, he played on the 1888 Yale football team that was coached by Walter Camp and included five players who were later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: George Washington Woodruff, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Lee \"Bum\" McClung, Pudge Heffelfinger, and Pa Corbin.\nRhodes was also elected captain of the 1889 Yale football team, but he declined to serve. He was then elected, and did serve as, captain of the 1890 team. As captain of the 1890 team, Rhodes led Yale to a 32–0 win over Princeton in front of 25,000 spectators in Brooklyn. Though he was a lineman, Rhodes played an important role as a rusher in the 1890 Princeton game. He set up Yale's first touchdown with a run that took the ball to within two feet of the goal line, had another run of 30 yards, scored a touchdown and returned a punt through the Princeton line for a gain of 25 yards. One newspaper described Rhodes' reaction to the victory as follows:\"The deep frown that has mantled the face of Capt William Castle Rhodes of the Yale foot-ball eleven since Saturday, gave way to a smile this afternoon. The smile became a genuine grin, as one by one the teeth of the Princeton Tiger were drawn, until by a score of 32 to 0 the formidable beast lay helpless and humiliated.\"\nRhodes had a reputation as an aggressive player. In the 1889 Yale–Princeton game, Rhodes was disqualified due to rough play early in the second half. Prior to the 1890 Harvard–Yale game, one newspaper noted that Harvard's tackle would have to \"look out\" for Rhodes and questioned whether he could withstand \"the hard knocks and blows which Yale's captain has the reputation of giving.\" Another newspaper focused on Rhodes' ability to cover the entire field of play: \"Rhodes is an experienced and exceedingly talented player. He handles his man well, knows where to put them and literally seems to cover the whole field himself.\"\nFootball coach at Yale.\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1891, Rhodes returned to his home in Cleveland where he played football in the fall of 1891. He returned to the East to serve as a referee at the November 11, 1891 Yale–Amherst game. Though Yale scored 27 points, Rhodes concluded that Yale had a lot of work to do and agreed to serve as the team's coach for the remainder of the season. He became Yale's second head football coach, following the legendary Walter Camp. \"The World\" of New York described Rhodes' return to Yale as follows:\"W.C. Rhodes, captain of last year's Yale team, came to New Haven to-day, and will coach the eleven through Thanksgiving. He saw the Amherst game this afternoon as referee and expressed himself as far from satisfied with the team's showing.

Its home venue was at Chislehurst Common.\nHistory.\nChislehurst is first recorded in July 1738 when it played London Cricket Club on Chislehurst Common. A rematch was quickly arranged and took place at the Artillery Ground a week later, with a third match at the same venue played in September.\nChislehurst played London each season from 1738 to 1741. In 1743, a combined Chislehurst and Bromley XI played London in two matches and, in 1746, a combined Chislehurst and London team played Addington.\nToday.\nCricket is still played on Chislehurst Common as the Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club has its ground there on the appropriately named Cricket Ground Road. The club is an amalgamation of two 19th-century clubs. The West Kent Cricket Club was originally based in Bromley but lost its ground in 1821 due to the enclosure of Bromley Common. The club was rescued by an offer from the Chislehurst authorities to let them establish a new ground on Chislehurst Common. In 1876, three small local clubs amalgamated and called themselves the Chislehurst Cricket Club and agreement was reached so that the two clubs shared Cricket Ground Road for the next 100 years. West Kent CC was dissolved in 1980 and the Chislehurst club, now known as the Chislehurst and West Kent Cricket Club, has sole use of the ground."

Rugby union was first introduced by British, Kiwi and Australian sailors, and also through the French and the strong presence of the game amongst Pacific Nations. Top Tahitian clubs participate in the domestic club league, the Championnat de Tahiti. Clubs also competed in friendlies vs foreign club teams from neighboring nations as far across the Pacific to Chile. \nThe national side competes annually in the Oceania Cup, last winning the competition in 2017. Traditionally, rugby union matches in French Polynesia tend to be held in the evening rather than the afternoon, due to the tropical climate. Because of this, organisers of rugby union in Tahiti tend to put on entertainment during the day, to keep visiting rugby players etc. happy.\nGoverning body.\nThe Tahitian union was founded in 1989, and affiliated to the IRB in 1994.\nHistory.\nRugby is greatly growing in popularity in Tahiti, but the national sport still remains football.\nRugby came to Tahiti via three separate streams, firstly, through the visits of British, New Zealand and Australian sailors; secondly, through the French presence (many of the main teams are still French military); and thirdly through contact with neighbouring Pacific islands, where the game is popular.\nUp to 2003, Tahiti played in international rugby sevens (Pacific Games) and XV-a-side, in the qualifying rounds for the Rugby World Cup.\nIn 2006, there were fourteen clubs in the national championship and two divisions. There were also sevens competitions, women's rugby, and under-18 rugby competitions as well.\nNational team.\nLack of infrastructure and the dispersed nature of both the geography and population of Tahiti has hindered international success.\nThe Tahiti national rugby union team had its first internationals in 1997, losing 92-6 to Papua New Guinea,\nand 40-0 to the Cook Islands. To be fair, Oceania is perhaps the toughest arena in World Rugby,\nhaving not just the mighty All Blacks, but also the likes of the Wallabies, Fiji, Tonga\nand Samoa, all of which do well in the Rugby World Cup.\nDue to Tahiti being a territory of France, rugby players born in Tahiti are actually French citizens, making them eligible to represent France. The issue has been resolved with the IRB, giving the players themselves to choose which country they wish to represent."

        "title": "Challenge Cup (Australian rules football)",
        "text": "The Challenge Cup was the name of several football trophies contested in Melbourne, Australia, during the 1860s and 1870s under the Melbourne Football Club rules and the Victorian rules (which were early versions of Australian rules football).\nHistory.\nFootball in Victoria was played under an informal administrative structure prior to the formation of the Victorian Football Association in 1877. As such, any trophies or competitions were unofficial, and were arranged entirely at the agreement of the participating clubs. Trophies were either purchased by the clubs or donated by a third party.\nThere were three Challenge Cups which were contested among the top senior metropolitan clubs between 1861 and 1871: \nThe Challenge Cup, which was won and held based on the results of specific games, was separate from the premiership (which is considered to have officially existed from 1870), which was based on a club's results in all games during a season.\nCaledonian Society Challenge Cup.\nThe inaugural football Challenge Cup was a silver cup donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne. It was initially put up as the prize for a football match between University and a team of challengers which was to have been played during the Society's Caledonian games on 28 December 1861. \nThe game was attempted, but abandoned well short of its full length as there was inadequate space among the other Caledonian games events to accommodate a football game. The cup itself was nevertheless presented to University.\nIn May 1862, the same cup was put up as a prize in a scheduled match between University and the Melbourne Football Club, but the game was twice postponed due to University having insufficient players to field a team. Melbourne claimed that University had forfeited the match and that it should take ownership of the cup, but University rejected this and remained in possession. The matter was finally resolved on-field in 1863, when Melbourne defeated University 2–1 over three afternoons' play in July and August – at that time, matches were untimed and won by the first team to score two goals: the first day's play on 18 July was scoreless, the second day's play on 8 August resulted in one goal to each team, and the winning goal was scored after half an hour's play on 22 August.\nThereafter, the cup was put up by Melbourne as a perpetual prize to be contested in all matches between the holder and a challenger. As was commonplace with trophies in many sports at the time, the cup would remain a perpetual prize until won three times consecutively by the same team, at which point permanent possession would pass to that team.\nOnly three more matches were played for the Caledonian Society Cup, all won by Geelong:\nThus, Geelong became the permanent owner of the Calendonian Society Challenge Cup.\nAthletic Sports Committee Challenge Cup.\nIn 1865, the Athletic Sports Committee put up a new Challenge Cup trophy, valued at ten guineas. As with the previous trophy, any match between the holder of the trophy and a challenger would be played for the trophy, matches would be played on the ground of the holder, and the first club to win the cup three times consecutively (with an unlimited number of drawn matches in that streak) would become its permanent owner. The Athletic Sports Committee could be called upon to resolve disputes.\nMatches played during 1865 for the cup were as follows:\nPrior to the 1866 season, the Athletic Sports Committee made adjustments to the rules relating to Cup matches:\nWhile another rule had called for matches to start promptly at 2 pm, to prevent the holder of the cup from delaying the start of a match to reduce the time available for the challenger to score two goals, this rule was repeatedly broken over the following year by South Yarra, which was often up to an hour late, drawing considerable bad will towards the club. Matches played during 1866 were:\nThis gave South Yarra its third consecutive win (with five drawn matches in between), thus giving it permanent possession of the cup. No cup was contested between 1867 and 1869.\nThe trophy itself – a 20 cm high silver cup inscribed with the words \"Champion Football Cup – Presented by the Athletic Sports Committee 1865\" – was long thought to have been lost. It resurfaced unexpectedly in 2007, having been inherited by a man in Bristol, England with no obvious connection to 1860s football. It was subsequently loaned to be put on display at the National Sports Museum.\nSouth Yarra Presentation Challenge Cup.\nThe South Yarra Football Club decided to purchase and donate a new trophy for competition in 1870. As with the previous cups, it was contested in all matches between the holder and a challenger, but this time a club would be required to win it four times consecutively without defeat (still with no limit on the number of drawn matches) to claim it permanently. \nIn 1869, the rules of football had been changed so that matches were won by the team which secured the most goals in two halves of 50 minutes, rather than by the first team to score twice. \nFive clubs contested the Cup during the 1870 season: Melbourne, Carlton, South Yarra, Albert-park and Railway. Albert-park took possession of the trophy from South Yarra in the first game it was contested, and then claimed three wins and five draws from its next eight games to claim permanent ownership of the cup, but South Yarra and other clubs disputed the claim, arguing that the club's second victory, a walk-over after Railway forfeited when only fourteen of its players arrived, should have counted as a cancellation and not a forfeiture. Albert-park ultimately gave the Cup back to South Yarra at the end of the year, but maintained its position that it had won it outright and was making the gift in its capacity as the trophy's owner.\nThe South Yarra Challenge Cup was again put up for competition again in 1871. While Albert-park declined to contest it, it continued to play senior games against the other clubs. The remaining three clubs – Carlton, Melbourne and South Yarra – decided that each club would play the others three times during the season, and the top two would play a single playoff match for the cup. This meant that the cup was being contested in a league-type competition, and by traditional definitions was no longer a challenge cup with a perpetual holder.\nCarlton and Melbourne were clear qualifiers for the final ahead of South Yarra, who were winless: two Carlton-Melbourne matches were postponed by four weeks due to rain, while two unplayed Carlton-South Yarra matches were scratched as they would have no effect on the outcome.\nCarlton won the Grand Final (the first of its kind in history) 2–0 to claim undisputed and permanent ownership of the South Yarra Challenge Cup.\nThere were no further Challenge Cups contested among the senior metropolitan clubs, with the bitterness arising from repeated disputes over ownership of each cup being a significant factor in this.\nOther Challenge Cups.\nThere were several other challenge cups presented in provincial and junior football. Among them were:"

A total of twenty-four Games records were set or improved over the competition, leaving just five previous best marks untouched. The 1954 edition saw the introduction of the shot put and discus throw for women, as well as the first 4×110 yards relay for women (which replaced a medley relay).\nThe men's mile run competition – dubbed \"The Miracle Mile\" – represented a landmark in the history of the Four-minute mile. Roger Bannister had been the first to have broken the barrier earlier that year, but Landy followed soon after with sub-4 minute (and world record time) of his own. The games offered the first time that two sub-4 minute runners had duelled against each other. Landy led until the final curve, at which point he turned to gauge Bannister's position. Bannister took the opportunity to overtake him on his blind side and he edged out a victory over Landy with a time of 3:58.8 minutes. Landy also ran under four minutes, representing the first time two men had done so in the same race. A sculpture of the race-deciding moment was later placed outside the stadium in memory of the duel.\nJim Peters, then the world record holder in the marathon, entered the stadium some seventeen minutes ahead of his nearest rival in the Games marathon. He collapsed in his final lap of the stadium, however, and did not finish the race (which was won by Joe McGhee).\nA new Commonwealth record for the high jump was established at the games by Emmanuel Ifeajuna of Nigeria, who became the first Commonwealth athlete to clear six feet and eight inches. Ifeajuna was also the first black African to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games."

The stadium, set in the suburb of Floreat, was purpose-built for the competition. A total of 31 events were contested, of which 21 by male and 10 by female athletes. The competition was affected by hot weather and soldiers from the Australian Army were called upon to supply athletes with water throughout the competition. Heavy wind also affected the programme, with the sprints and jumps most affected by the conditions.\nThe 1962 Games saw the reintroduction of the men's 3000 metres steeplechase and the women's 880 yards – events which had both been absent for four editions, having previously been held at the 1934 British Empire Games. Kenyan Seraphino Antao won double gold in the sprints, an achievement which marked a breakthrough in the sport for his country. Dorothy Hyman completed the same feat on the women's side. Peter Snell won gold medals in both the 880 yds and the mile run. In the men's 3 miles race, Ronald Clarke found himself outdone by reigning Olympics 5000 metres champion Murray Halberg. Women's thrower Valerie Young built upon her 1958 shot put gold with victories in both the shot put and discus throw."

It was first granted Commonwealth Games sport status in 2002, and has been held in each edition since, except in Delhi 2010 Games due to the lack of suitable venue for the swimming leg in Delhi. Until 2022, it was a core sport which had to be included in each competition's sporting programme. Para-triathlon was first included as an optional sport in the Gold Coast 2018 games. The next appearance of the sport will take place in the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Australia\nCurrently there are five triathlon events in the Commonwealth Games.\nIndividual events are held for men and women and have been since the sport's introduction in 2002, while a mixed team relay has been on the programme since 2014.\nAdditionally, as part of its program of integrating parasport into the Commonwealth Games, two paratriathlon events were included in the 2018 Games in Gold Coast, Australia. These events, one for each sex, where wheelchair paratriathlon events ('PTW1' and 'PTW2' classifications) using a multiple start format to ensure fairness across different wheelchair classes. In the 2022 Games the paratriathlon events were retained, and were for athletes with visual impairments ('PTVI' classification). A third set of paratriathlon events, as yet undesignated, has been announced for Victoria 2026.\nAt the 1990 Commonwealth Games at Auckland, Triathlon was a demonstration event; won by Erin Baker (women) and Rick Wells (men), both from New Zealand.\nFlora Duffy of Bermuda is the only triathlete of either sex to win two individual gold medals, or to win gold medals in separate Games, while Alistair Brownlee. Jodie Stimpson and Alex Yee have each won two Commonwealth Games gold medals, one individual, one mixed relay, in a single Games. Alistair Brownlee, with two golds and one silver medal, is overall the most successful triathlete in Commonwealth Games history. Jacob Birtwhistle, Matthew Hauser, Jonny Brownlee and Vicky Holland have also won 3 medals, including at least one relay gold."

The youngest competitor from Canada competing in the commonwealth games was 18-year-old diver David Snively, then considered \"one of Canada's top divers\".\nIn the women's 3 metre springboard event, Janet Nutter led all the competitors after the first six dives with 264.27 points, despite battling a cold and laryngitis.\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"

In 2008, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nProfessional career.\nChicago White Sox.\nMitchell was drafted in the first round ( overall) of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft by the Chicago White Sox. White Sox scouting director Doug Laumann was familiar with Mitchell because he played the previous two summers in an amateur league near Laumann's Cincinnati-area residence. He began his professional career with the Kannapolis Intimidators, the Single–A affiliate of the White Sox. He finished the season with a .296 batting average, 12 doubles, two triples, no home runs, 10 runs batted in, 5 stolen bases, 23 walks, and 40 strikeouts in 115 at bats.\nOn March 16, 2010, Mitchell underwent surgery to repair a tear of the tendon in his left ankle; he missed the entire season.

        "title": "2010 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2010 Giro d'Italia was the 93rd edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race started off in Amsterdam on 8 May and stayed in the Netherlands for three stages, before leaving the country. The route included climbs such as Monte Zoncolan, Plan de Corones, the Passo del Mortirolo and the Passo di Gavia before ending in Verona with an individual time trial.\nPrincipal favorites for overall success in the Giro included Ivan Basso of the team, Cadel Evans for , and 's Carlos Sastre. After three weeks of racing, it was Basso who claimed his second Giro d'Italia title, after also winning in 2006. David Arroyo from and Basso's teammate Vincenzo Nibali rounded out the podium. Australian riders won all the lesser jersey awards, with Evans taking the points classification, 's Matthew Lloyd the winner of the mountains classification, and Richie Porte of the Giro's best young rider.\nThe road race stages in the Netherlands were both marred by repeated crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13 minutes against the remainder of the field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22 teams, as 17 of them came away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.\nTeams.\nThe 22 teams in the race were announced on 22 March. Sixteen teams were guaranteed a place in the race by virtue of a September 2008 agreement between the UCI and the organizers of the season's three Grand Tours. Those guaranteed a place are those who were members of the UCI ProTour at the time of the agreement. Two from this group, and , declined to participate in the race, instead focusing on the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. Two new teams joined the ProTour for 2010. One, , participated in the race, but the other, , did not wish to participate, since they planned to send their best riders to the partially concurrent Tour of California. Seven UCI Professional Continental teams, two of which ( and ) were part of the September 2008 agreement as they were members of the ProTour at that time, joined the 15 ProTour teams to round out the teams list. Each team entered a squad of nine riders, giving the event a 198-rider peloton at its outset.\nThe race's 22 teams were:\nNon-invitation of Dutch teams.\nThe Giro, like the 2009 Vuelta a España before it and the forthcoming Tour de France, began in the Netherlands. The two Dutch Professional Continental teams, and , had both ridden Grand Tours in 2009. Throughout the season, the two teams tried to prove their combativeness in the hopes of securing Grand Tour invites, trying especially to outdo one another. Since the openings to the Giro and the Tour were partly financed by Dutch tax money, Vacansoleil's team manager called for political help to get invites for his team, but neither Dutch team made it into either the Giro or the Tour. Consequently, neither made the Vuelta a España teams selection, either. The teams' disappointment at their non-invitation led to communications with UCI President Pat McQuaid, which may result in reforms to how teams are selected for the Grand Tours.\nPre-race favorites.\nThe Giro was often described as being wide open in terms of who had the best chance to win it. This is because many notable riders, including the past three champions, did not enter. 2007 Giro d'Italia champion Danilo Di Luca, who originally finished second in the 2009 Giro d'Italia, was suspended by his national federation in February for a doping incident in the 2009 Giro. 2008 Giro d'Italia champion Alberto Contador skipped the Giro to better focus on the Tour de France, as he also had in the previous season. After first indicating that he might defend his championship, 2009 champion Denis Menchov also announced that he would not ride the Giro, instead focusing on the Tour de France, in order to complete the career sweep of the Grand Tours. Lance Armstrong and Levi Leipheimer, leaders of the squad in the 2009 Giro, announced in October 2009 that they would ride the partially concurrent Tour of California instead of the Giro, which is why was not selected for the Giro.\nJust five days before the race began, the UCI announced several riders were under suspicion of doping by virtue of irregular values in their biological passports. Among them was Franco Pellizotti, who had been set to be one of the leaders for the team and had been described as a pre-race favorite. While team firmly stood behind Pellizotti in the case and expressed anger that the UCI unveiled their findings so close to the start of the Giro, they obligingly pulled him from their squad. He was replaced by Vincenzo Nibali, who had been planning to ride the Tour of California as a squad leader. While not an overall favorite, Alessandro Ballan intended to participate in the race, stating in October that it was a certainty he would start, after missing out on the Giro in 2009 when he was world champion. This was an indication well in advance that the was in line for an invite to the race. Ballan was later suspended by his team as a result of an internal doping investigation, meaning he had to miss the Giro. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing.\nMost pre-race analyses identified Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, and Carlos Sastre as the major favorites to win the overall classification, with Evans perhaps the consensus pick. Basso and Sastre had both ridden the Giro in 2009 and come away finishing in the top five. Sastre also won two difficult mountain stages in the race's final week, and was noted as a rider who gets stronger as a race goes along, making the Giro's very climbing-intensive third week possibly sit in his favor. Evans had finished on a Grand Tour podium in each of the past three seasons, including in the most recent three-week event, the 2009 Vuelta a España. He also entered the race as the reigning world cycling champion and had had a successful 2010 season to date, with a win in La Flèche Wallonne and a podium finish in the Tirreno–Adriatico. Neither Basso nor Sastre had raced much in the 2010 season prior to the Giro. Other riders named as contenders included Bradley Wiggins, former Giro winners Damiano Cunego and Stefano Garzelli, Alexander Vinokourov, Marzio Bruseghin, Christian Vande Velde, Domenico Pozzovivo, David Moncoutié, and Michele Scarponi. Race director Angelo Zomegnan also named Basso, Evans, and Sastre as his three favorites, and included Wiggins and Linus Gerdemann as possible darkhorses.\nMark Cavendish and Daniele Bennati, stage winners in the past two editions of the Giro, were absent from this race, but several top sprinters took the start in Amsterdam. These included Tyler Farrar, André Greipel, and Alessandro Petacchi, all of whom had themselves won Grand Tour stages in 2009 and figured to be top favorites for the Giro's flat stages. Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut in this race, but he pulled out due to sinusitis shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.\nRoute and stages.\nThe Giro's 21 stages were divided into the following classifications by race organizers Gazzetta dello Sport: four time trials (three individual and one team), seven flat stages, five mixed stages, and six mountain stages. The race began in the Netherlands, the ninth time in the Giro's history that the race began outside Italy, and the first since 2006's start in Belgium. A short individual time trial and two flat stages were held there. Starting the race away from Italy meant that an early rest day, coming just three days into the 23-day race, was necessary to transfer to Italy. The first stage upon entering Italy was a team time trial, the fifth consecutive year that discipline had featured in the Giro. Stage 7 visited Tuscany and was raced partly on unpaved roads used yearly in the Italian semi-classic Montepaschi Strade Bianche. The course honored Italian cycling legends Gino Bartali, Fausto Coppi, and Costante Girardengo by passing through their hometowns in the first road race stages in Italy.\nFive stages ended with climbs, with most coming in the race's last week. The first was stage 8 to Monte Terminillo, a long climb gaining of vertical elevation for an average gradient of 7.3 percent, one of the most difficult climbs in the Apennine Mountains in the region of Abruzzo. The next was Monte Zoncolan in the Carnic Alps, which at in length was shorter than some of the other climbs in the race, but with of vertical gain in that time, its 20 percent maximum gradient made it one of the most difficult. The Stage 16 individual time trial went to Plan de Corones, on a course identical to the one used in the 2008 Giro d'Italia. In , this stage gained over and featured a section with 24 percent gradients in the final kilometer. The Giro's last two road race stages were especially climbing-intensive, including the Passo del Mortirolo, rising in for an average gradient of 10 percent, and the Passo di Gavia, known for being climbed during the 1988 Giro d'Italia in the middle of a driving blizzard. The Gavia was also the \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point, and Stage 20, in which it featured, was considered the queen stage. Other climbs during the race included the Passo del Bratello, Monte Grappa, the Passo delle Palade, the Passo di Santa Cristina, the Forcola di Livigno, and the last climb of the race, the Passo del Tonale. Most of these climbs also featured difficult descents.\nThe route was noted to appeal to many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were inviting for breakaways. Sastre, one of the first riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time trialing was not great and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time trialing to be Giro champion.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began in Amsterdam with an individual time trial. Favorites for the stage included two British riders, captain Bradley Wiggins and ' David Millar. Several riders in the Giro peloton considered Wiggins the prohibitive favorite. Wiggins won the stage, securing the first pink jersey. A major surprise on the stage was Grand Tour rookie Brent Bookwalter from coming in second, just 2 seconds off Wiggins' winning time. Millar was seventh, 6 seconds back. This set the stage for a turbulent opening to the Giro, as both of the road race stages in the Netherlands featured several crashes. The courses for the road stages in the Netherlands were noted to have a lot of street furniture on them, which combined with the riders' nerves on the first day of a three-week Grand Tour as well as crosswinds from the North Sea to make the first mass-start stages very perilous. Tyler Farrar, Carlos Sastre, Christian Vande Velde, Greg Henderson, Wiggins, Alessandro Petacchi, Domenico Pozzovivo, Marzio Bruseghin, Filippo Pozzato, and Gilberto Simoni all fell from their bikes at some point while the Giro was in the Netherlands. There were also many other crashes that took down so many riders it was difficult to keep track of exactly who was effected. Crashing and, consequently, falling away from the leading group on the road, meant different things for different riders. For sprinters like Farrar and Petacchi, crashing meant they were unlikely to be able to contest the finishes for stage wins, while overall contenders like Wiggins and Sastre lost time in the general classification. For the second year in a row, Vandevelde suffered a broken collarbone as a result of his crash, consequently abandoning the race. Despite crashing during stage 2, Farrar got up and was able to win the stage from a depleted field sprint. The state of the roads in the Netherlands and the sheer quantity of crashes that took place there incurred much criticism and questions over whether they should be included in a Grand Tour. Cadel Evans and Alexander Vinokourov both took the pink jersey while the Giro was in the Netherlands. Vinokourov held it prior to the transfer to Italy, with six riders from three teams within 10 seconds of him, meaning the pink jersey still remained very much in flux.\nAfter the transfer, the first stage in Italy was a team time trial, a race where each member of the squad races against the clock together, and the team's time is taken for the fifth rider to cross the finish line. was the winning squad, and had a time gap over Vinokourov's team that was sufficiently large enough for Vincenzo Nibali to become the fourth race leader in as many stages. At last, there was stability in the race leadership, as Nibali comfortably retained over the next two stages, both of which featured breakaways taking the day's honors while the peloton finished together. Stage 7 was a major one, incorporating stretches of gravel roads near the finish. The day on which this stage was run also happened to have very heavy rainfall, making the course muddy and dangerous. Much like had happened in the Netherlands, a great many riders crashed in this stage, perhaps chief among them Wiggins and Sastre, who both lost more than four minutes. Nibali also crashed, and upon seeing this, Alexander Vinokourov, Damiano Cunego, and Cadel Evans broke free of the leading group. Evans won the stage, one of many riders to cross the finish line covered in mud, and Vinokourov took back the race leadership. Through the first mountain stage and two flat stages that followed, the overall standings did not change much, and Vinokourov retained the jersey.\nStage 11 into L'Aquila provided for major changes to the overall standings. More than 50 riders formed the day's escape group, and they quickly took 20 minutes advantage. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and 's Richie Porte, who was holding the white jersey as best young rider and, at sixth overall, was the best-placed man in the group. Sastre, Wiggins, and Porte all had multiple support riders with them in the breakaway who set strenuous paces to keep the group away. The main field, containing the Giro's top favorites, pulled back a little time but was still nearly 13 minutes behind stage winner Evgeni Petrov at the finish. The day's result massively shuffled the overall classification. Porte was the only rider who had been in the top ten before the stage who remained there afterward, and took the pink jersey. Sastre and Wiggins, who entered the Giro as contenders but had fallen well back in the overall standings before this stage, both moved back into the top ten.\nPorte kept the pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow member of the L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall favorites began to creep back into the top of the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.\nAfter a stage each for the breakaway and the sprinters, during which there were no major changes to the overall standings, the riders were faced with the very climbing-intensive final two road stages. The team rode a very hard tempo in stage 19 over the Passo del Mortirolo, which eventually whittled that group down to just Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi. They crossed the Mortirolo more than two minutes ahead of Arroyo, which was nearly enough time to make Basso the virtual race leader. Arroyo, noted as a far better descender than Basso, took very aggressive lines coming down the Mortirolo and caught up with Vinokourov, Sastre, Evans, and John Gadret, who had been between him and the leading trio. Basso's group had only 30 seconds on Arroyo's at the start of the stage-concluding Aprica climb, but they took more and more time as the climb went on and finished three minutes ahead, giving Basso the pink jersey with two days left to race. Arroyo elected not to try to aggressively descend any of the four large climbs on course in the final road race stage, settling for second place by riding with Basso and the other top riders in the peloton most of the day. There were a few changes in time gaps, but the same riders remained in the top ten from the previous day, as Johan Tschopp won the stage from a breakaway. The individual time trial in Verona which closed out the Giro also provided for small changes to the overall, but Basso's 15th place on the stage was easily enough to make him Giro champion. Arroyo and Nibali rounded out the podium.\nAustralian riders won each of the lesser jersey awards. Evans won the points classification, represented in 2010 with a red jersey in a return to the original colour scheme for the three minor classifications that reflected the colours of the Italian flag. Evans's victory came about by way of nine top-ten finishes, including a stage win, over the course of the race. This classification was tightly contested throughout the race; six different riders held the jersey, and it changed hands nine times. Matthew Lloyd of won the green jersey for the mountains classification, taking maximum mountains points during his stage-winning breakaway in stage 6. He made morning breakaways later on in mountain stages to take points on other climbs and consolidate his lead. Porte won the white jersey as best young rider, holding it for all but three stages. Success was widespread among the 22 teams in the race. In sharp contrast to the 2009 Giro, the only rider to win multiple stages in this year's race was Farrar, who took the sprint finishes to stages 2 and 10. , , , , , , , and each won one stage. had two stage wins, first with Wouter Weylandt in a depleted sprint finish to stage 3 in the Netherlands, and two stages later Jérôme Pineau led a winning breakaway across the finish line. 's Chris Anker Sørensen won stage 8 on Monte Terminillo after figuring into a morning breakaway, and their time trial specialist Gustav Larsson won the final race against the clock in Verona. won multiple sprint stages, first with leadout man Matthew Goss when ace sprinter André Greipel missed out on the opportunity, and later Greipel himself took a win. took back-to-back stage wins, first with Petrov in L'Aquila and then with Filippo Pozzato, who won a 10-man sprint after a late breakaway in stage 12. After there had been no Italian stage winners for the first 11 days of racing, Pozzato's stage win was the first of five in a row and six overall for Italian riders. Nibali and Basso were among those stage winners; as they also won the stage 4 team time trial, theirs was the only squad with more than two stage wins. They also won both teams classifications, the time-based Trofeo Fast Team and the points-based Trofeo Super Team. , , and did not win any stages, but Vinokourov's and Arroyo's stints in the pink jersey and Tom Stamsnijder's win in the \"Traguardo Volante\" classification meant that they did not come away from the Giro empty-handed. Only , , , , and came away from the Giro with nothing, even though Milram had one of their riders (Paul Voss) wearing the Mountains jersey at some point.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2010 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage had no effect on what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25 points, second place earned 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1985 were eligible.\nThere were also three classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team; and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the \"Traguardo Volante\", or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known in previous years as the \"Intergiro\" and the \"Expo Milano 2015\" classification. It was won by Tom Stamsnijder of the team.\nOther awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner Matthew Lloyd won this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was won, like the closely associated points classification, by Cadel Evans. Additionally, the \"Premio della Fuga\" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. 's Jérôme Pineau was first in this competition. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. was most successful in avoiding penalties, and so won the Fair Play classification.\nWorld Rankings points.\nThe Giro was one of 26 events throughout the season that contributed points towards the 2010 UCI World Ranking. Points were awarded to the top 20 finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage."

        "title": "List of Men's World Ice Hockey Championship players for Canada (1977–present)",
        "text": "Canada has participated in 70 of 79 Ice Hockey World Championships, an annual ice hockey tournament organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). During the first 40 years of the tournament (1920–1961), Canada did not have a national team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Allan Cup winner. A national team program, consisting of amateur players, was implemented following the 1961 tournament. By the late 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive and pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF voted to allow Canada to use nine non-National Hockey League (NHL) professional players at the 1970 World Championships, but the decision was reversed in January 1970. In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition. Canada's ice hockey team did not participate in the 1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics. Günther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. The IIHF agreed to allow \"open competition\" between all players in the World Championships, and moved the competition to later in the season so players not involved in the NHL playoffs could participate. The first open World Championship was held in 1977 in Vienna, Austria, and saw the first participation of active NHL players, including team captain Phil Esposito, a two-time NHL MVP. Many of the players on the Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the gameplay at the international level. The team finished fourth. Hockey Canada is responsible for the Canadian team roster and operations.\nSince 1977, Canada has participated in all 39 tournaments, sending 66 goaltenders and 492 skaters (forwards and defencemen). During this period, Canadian teams have won 18 medals: six gold medals, seven silver medals and five bronze medals. Thirty-one players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and sixteen into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux have also been inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame and are the only players to have been inducted into all three. Dany Heatley and Shane Doan have each won five medals (two gold, three silver), more than any player since 1977. Eric Brewer has won the most gold medals, with three. Heatley, who has scored 38 goals and registered 62 points over six tournaments, is Canada's all-time goals and points leader at the tournament since 1977. Twenty-six players have served as team captain during this period. Ryan Smyth has played for eight teams and captained six (from 2001 to 2005, and in 2010), more than any other player since 1977 in both cases, and has been given the nickname \"Captain Canada\"."

The facility is also called Woodley Cricket Field(s) or Woodley Cricket Complex due to its location in Woodley Park. Former Jamaican Test cricketer Franklyn Rose has said of the complex: \"It has the best cricket field facilities in the US. There is no comparison.\"\nHistory.\nThe cricket complex is named after Leo \"Jingles\" Magnus, a Jamaican cricketer who also played for the University Cricket Club and coached the Los Angeles Krickets, Sheenaway Serendipity Cricket Club and the Compton Cricket Club. It first opened in 1975.\nIn 1978, the Glendale Equestrian Center took over the Burbank-area Griffith Park Cricket Association grounds, which had been home to L.A. cricket via the Hollywood Cricket Club since 1933. An active West Indian cricket community obtained land in the Sepulveda Basin in 1977 and two fields at Woodley opened in 1980 (named the Clifford Severn and Ernie Wright grounds), with two more added in 1996 (the Jean Wong and John Marder grounds (now under Los Angeles Cricket's, a 501 (c)(3), guardianship), both named for former Southern California Cricket Association presidents). The complex has a small stand, which can seat 50, and a clubhouse with bathrooms.\nIn 1997, Woodley hosted the Jamaican team (featuring Jimmy Adams and Franklyn Rose) and in 1999 hosted a List A match between an India A side (with VVS Laxman) against an Australia A side (with Brett Lee, Adam Gilchrist, and Andrew Symonds), which attracted a crowd of 5,000. In the 2000s, Twenty20 cricket became popular and Southern California Cricket Association President Vehman Reddy helped bring the Trinidad and Tobago side and Punjabi Blues to L.A. for three annual tournaments. The complex is frequently used for United States of America Cricket Association trials. The first American College Cricket west-coast regional championship took place at Woodley in 2010. The American Cricket Federation hosted its first Twenty20 tournament at Woodley in 2012.\nIn 2016 the International Cricket Council (ICC) held the World Cricket League Division Four tournament at the LMCC. This was the first time an ICC WCL divisional event had been played in the United States. The U.S. won the tournament by beating Oman in the Final and both were promoted to Division Three.

        "title": "1971 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 1971 Daytona 500, the 13th running of the event, was a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race held on February 14, 1971 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Spanning on the paved oval track, it was the first Daytona 500 in the Winston Cup era of NASCAR. During this time, Richard Petty (the race winner and the eventual Winston Cup champion) was becoming one of the winningest veterans on the NASCAR circuit.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nRace report.\nThe manufacturers that were involved included Chevrolet, Mercury, Ford, Plymouth, and Dodge. For the 500 miles the average speed was .\nThe fastest qualifying speed for the 1971 Daytona 500 was more than . The forty car field included legends like A. J. Foyt and David Pearson, both eventually acquiring top-five finishes. A.J. Foyt in the Wood Bros. Mercury had the car to beat all day, but the crew had trouble filling it with gas. He ran out while leading on lap 162. Foyt's crew found out someone crushed the filler neck on the gas tank. There were 34 lead changes in the first 250 miles of the race.\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for Bill Dennis and Maynard Troyer. Only Daytona 500 start for Pedro Rodriguez, Freddy Fryar, Marv Acton, and Larry Baumel. Last Daytona 500 starts for Fred Lorenzen, LeeRoy Yarbrough, and Friday Hassler.\nDrivers who failed to qualify for the race were: Ed Negre (#8), Vic Elford (#59), Charlie Roberts (#63), Dick May (#67), J.D. McDuffie (#70), Bill Shirey (#74), Dick Poling (#78), Joe Hines (#80), Bobby Mausgrover (#84), Butch Hirst (#87), Leonard Blanchard (#95), Robert Brown (#58), E.J. Trivette (#56), Roy Mayne (#46), Jimmy Crawford (#02), Pedro Rodríguez (#14), Dub Simpson (#16), Fritz Schultz (#23), Earl Brooks (#26), Bill Hollar (#28), Walter Ballard (#30), Wendell Scott (#34), Blackie Wangerin (#38) and Ken Meisenhelder (#41).\nNotable crew chiefs for this race were Paul Goldsmith, Junie Donlavey, Harry Hyde, Dale Inman, Tom Vandiver, Vic Ballard, Jake Elder among others.\nFinishing order.\n\"† Driver is known to be deceased\" \n\"* Driver failed to finish race\"\nPost-race report.\nWinnings and championship potential.\nThe winner's purse for the 1971 Daytona 500 was $45,450 American dollars ($ when inflation is taken into effect). Last place finisher received $1,000 ($ with inflation). Richard Petty would go on to win four more Daytona 500 races (1973, 1974, 1979, and 1981). There were seven cautions for forty-four laps.\nAttendance.\nAttendance for the 1971 Daytona 500 reached 80,000 spectators; Expansion in the next eighteen years would bring attendance up to 180,000 people. ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" televised the race. The commentary was done by the legendary Chris Economaki who did the Daytona 500 races in the 1970s.\nEnd of a tradition.\nAll of the vehicles utilized during that running of the Daytona 500 were based on street version sheet metal and engine blocks of cars manufactured between 1969 and 1971. Deviation of up to two or three model years was expected because parity wasn't enforced by NASCAR during that era and different teams had different budgets from each other.\nOut of the forty racers competing in the 1971 Daytona 500, thirty-nine were American and one was Mexican. Pedro Rodriguez (who would finish in thirteenth place) would have an asphalt racing course named after him after he died six months later in Germany during a sports car race (along with his older brother Ricardo Rodríguez).\nIn this race, Dick Brooks would be the final driver to make a competitive run with a winged vehicle. Following the 1970 season, special, limited production 'aero' cars such as the Dodge Daytona and Plymouth Superbird, as well as the Ford Torino Talladega and Mercury Spoiler II, were restricted to a 305 ci engine. Brooks' Mario Rossi team was the only team to run a winged car in the race, and although they had a 7th-place run in the race, elected to run a conventional big-block powered car the rest of the season. Rear wings would not appear again in NASCAR until 2008 with the 'Car of Tomorrow'."

It is believed that the first rugby in Libya was played by British troops or possibly Italians. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Libyan rugby tended to look to Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa.\nThe first Libyan team, the Benghazi Wasps, was set up in the 1970s and played against teams from expatriate oil workers. In 1998, Jamal abed founded team called the Tripoli Barbarians, but it was not until 2008 that official club teams recognised by Libya's governing body for sports were set up in Benghazi.\nThe first official tournament took place in 2008 in Benghazi, organised by Thair El Heri. The first officially recognised body for rugby was the Benghazi Rugby Committee."

        "text": "Family Mini Golf (Okiraku Putter Golf in Japan) is a miniature golf video game developed by Arc System Works for WiiWare. It was released in Japan on March 10, 2009, in North America on June 22, 2009 and in the PAL region on April 2, 2010.\nGameplay.\nSimilar to \"Family Table Tennis\" and \"Family Glide Hockey\", players control a member of a family, including a mother, father, son (Billy), and daughter (Sarah), to play against another in a round of mini golf.\nThe game features three, 9-hole courses, with an additional three available as paid downloadable content.\nEach 9 level pack is 200 Wii Points each. The game is 500 Wii Points itself so it's 1100 Wii Points in all.\nReception.\nIGN called the game a \"frustratingly un-fun effort\", and were left confused by the controls which were at odds to the instructions in the game's operations manual. However, \"Nintendo Life\" found no apparent issue, praising their simplicity as well as the design of the courses, and thought the game excelled in multiplayer."

        "title": "Trinity College Dublin American Football",
        "text": "Trinity College Dublin American Football (competing as Trinity College; formerly known as the Trinity Thunderbolts) is the American Football team of Trinity College Dublin.\nFirst established as the Gridiron Society in 1993, a competitive team was formed in 2008. The team's first season was played in the Irish American Football League (IAFL) Development League. Since then they have competed in the Shamrock Bowl Conference (SBC) South.\nHistory.\nDublin University Gridiron Society.\nThe club was first established in the early nineties as the \"Dublin University Gridiron Society\". It went on to play flag football under the name \"Trinity Thunderbolts\" for one season but soon folded due to lack of numbers and interest.\nTrinity Thunderbolts.\n2008 season.\nIn 2007, the club was reinstated by new club captain Conor O'Shea, once again as the \"Trinity Thunderbolts\". IAFL commissioner Darrin O'Toole was recruited as coach. In their first year of full contact football, the Thunderbolts formed part of the new IAFL Development League (also known as the \"DV-8 league\"). Their season began with successive losses against the IAFL's oldest team, the Craigavon Cowboys. Another loss followed against the Dublin Rebels, the eventual league winners. The team then scored what would be its only victory of the season against the Dublin Dragons, in a 51–20 blowout. The Thunderbolts then lost to the Cork Admirals and the Rebels again to leave them at 1–5.\nDublin University American Football Club.\n2009 season.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2008 season, the team undertook moves to become an official Trinity College club, as required by college rules, renaming itself the \"Dublin University American Football Club\". After the departure of Darrin O'Toole, injured captain Conor O'Shea became head coach. The club went on a recruiting drive to increase its squad size, looking to improve on its 1–5 record.\nThe moves proved successful, as in the club's first match of the 2009 season, it defeated the Edenderry Soldiers on a scoreline of 56–0, which would prove to be both the highest margin of victory in the league that season, and the first of seven shutout victories for Trinity. Trinity's only loss of the season came in their second game, against the UCD Sentinels. They followed this quickly with two victories against the Sentinels, followed by victories against the Craigavon Cowboys, the Dublin Dragons, and two against the Erris Rams, to leave the team with an unassailable record of seven victories and one loss.\n2010 season.\nIn 2010, Darrin O'Toole returned as head coach, and the club looked to continue its success in the DV-8 league by moving into the main IAFL league. Trinity was placed in the IAFL Central division, alongside collegiate rivals the DCU Saints, the West Dublin Rhinos, and the league's most successful team, the Dublin Rebels. Despite a strong showing in early season games, including inaugural victories over the DCU Saints and the Belfast Trojans, the club suffered from poor form during the middle of the season, culminating in a 36–6 loss to the Saints in what would transpire to be their last competitive game before folding the following season.\n2011 season.\n2011 began brightly for the club, as they captured the IAFL College Bowl for the first time in spectacular fashion. Facing the UL Vikings in Limerick, the game finished 12–6 after triple overtime (7 quarters) and 3 hours and 45 minutes of play; an IAFL record for match length. The victory was sealed in the third quarter of overtime with a touchdown from Rob McDowell. Linebacker Stephen Carton was named game MVP. This form continued into the full IAFL league, as the club recorded three victories in its opening four games: against UCD, the Dublin Dragons, and the West Dublin Rhinos. However, the season would end poorly: the club was forced to withdraw from the league in early June due to a lack of players (the college's term having finished in May, many students became unavailable after this time). Despite forfeiting three games, running back Rob McDowell would go on to be named the 2011 IAFL league MVP.\n2012 season.\nTrinity hosted a preseason charity game in November against rivals UCD, with Trinity coming out on top 7–0 thanks to a Rob McDowell touchdown. But more importantly the game ensured the children in Temple Street hospital received presents that were donated by both sets of fans and players. Competing in the newly formed IAFL South division, following the restructuring of the IAFL's divisional system, Trinity was set to embark on their 2012 campaign with early match-ups against the top three-seeded teams in the country.\nIn their season opener, Trinity endured a crushing 55–8 defeat at the hands of the second-ranked UL Vikings. This was immediately followed by a 52–18 loss to the reigning league champions, the Dublin Rebels. Having begun the season 0–2, Trinity sought to redeem their poor start with a win against the number three-seeded Carrickfergus Knights. Trinity sprang to an early 12-point lead and would hold on to beat the Knights 19–16. Trinity went on to dominate the rest of their season, ending 6–2 and setting various offensive records. The club concluded its season with an exhibition game on 2 June against the New England Ironmen, a collection of graduating seniors from a number of NCAA Division III football programs located mainly in the New England region, including Endicott College, UMass Dartmouth, Juniata College, Curry College, and Worcester State University.\n2013 season.\nTrinity competed in the South division of the then newly formed Shamrock Bowl Conference (SBC) in the 2013 season.\nCaptains.\nThe captain of the club is the team's central figure. He, along with the committee, decides team policy and procedure according to the club's constitution and previous precedents. The committee appoints the team's Head Coach and resigns football related matters in the club to him. The current captain is Griffin Steinman.\nRecords.\n2014 season.\nWinning all eight regular season games, Trinity won the south division of the Shamrock Bowl Conference. En route to their undefeated year, Trinity's offence set league records in nearly every category. As well, Trinity had three players leading in the Shamrock Bowl Conference individual statistical categories in the 2014 season (QB Dan Finnamore, WR Daniel Murphy and K Conor McGinn). On 25 May 2014 they defeated the Belfast Trojans 18–0, bringing an end to their two-year unbeaten streak. After the regular season they matched up with the Dublin Rebels in the semi-finals of the playoffs. Trinity got the best of the Rebels with a dominant 41–8 win. The students then faced the Belfast Trojans once again in Shamrock Bowl XXVIII. In a rain-soaked matchup in Tallaght Stadium, the Trojans eked out a 7–0 win to capture their third Championship in a row.\nShamrock Bowl Playoffs.\nTrinity received a first-round bye in the playoffs and matched up against the Dublin Rebels in the semi-finals. After a commanding win over the Rebels, Trinity went on to play in Shamrock Bowl XXVIII against the Belfast Trojans. In a rain-soaked Tallaght Stadium, Belfast capitalised on a crucial Trinity turnover for the only score, and their second Shamrock Bowl win in a row.\n2015 season.\nTrinity followed its undefeated campaign with a 7–1 record. They lost the first game in a slow, muddy affair in UL. Following that they got a pair of unconventional wins including a scrappy 21-point comeback win at the Dublin Rebels. In a truly memorable game, the Rebels became the only IAFL team in history to squander such a large lead. Trinity drove to score the winning touchdown and capped it off with a successful 2-point conversion to WR Alex Gurnee. Their season rolled on much like their previous undefeated season with a defence that began firing on all cylinders to match their high-powered offence. A game against the Dublin Rhinos involved a jersey mishap where Trinity wore the Rhinos jerseys for the duration of their win. Some matches this season also took place at ALSAA due to scheduling issues. Trinity advanced to the playoff where they once again matched up with the Dublin Rebels. During the rainy match Trinity's offence couldn't be stopped and they advanced to Shamrock Bowl XXIX with a commanding 22–0 win over the rival Rebels. In the Dalymount Park rematch of the previous bowl game Trinity was stopped by the best team in Ireland. the Trojans got the victory by beating the students 28–14 and earning their fourth Championship in a row.\nShamrock Bowl Playoffs.\nTrinity received a first-round bye in the playoffs and matched up in a rematch of the regular season classic with the Dublin Rebels. In the away match at a neutral venue, Triniy held the high power Rebels to a shutout. Advancing to the Shamrock Bowl, Trinity played a rematch of last year's Shamrock Bowl against the Belfast Trojans.\n2016 season.\nOn the back of a second Shamrock Bowl loss Trinity's 2016 season never got off the ground: a paltry 2–6 record was all the students had to show. Coming into the campaign Trinity lost a core part of the team to the expatriation of Offensive Coordinator Craig Marron, Offensive Weapon Rob McDowell, OL Kieran Coughlan, QB Dan Finnamore, WR Alex Gurnee. Beleaguered, Trinity went into the season trying out different offensive combinations none of which provided for a stable week in week out team like the previous years. The season began in November with an 8–6 loss to UL in the College Championships. Beginning the SBC season Trinity lost away to UCD 22–0. They rebounded the next week against Craigavon at home. A close home loss to UL followed. Then an ugly loss away to North Kildare in a game overshadowed with penalties made for a 1–3 record at the halfway point. The students gained back some players from key injuries and recorded a 31–0 shutout win in a home rematch with North Kildare. It would be their last win during a season marred by inconsistent play on both sides of the ball. Trinity nevertheless faced a strong UL team in the first round of the playoffs and lost by a missed XP 7–6, ending their 2016 regular season. Emerging from the 2–6 season was Conor O'Dwyer who with a strong season at Tight End, was named to the Irish National Team. Trinity also played an international fixture against the visiting NYPD Finest Football team.\nShamrock Bowl Playoffs.\nTrinity received a Wild Card spot in the playoffs against UL Vikings. In the away match, RB Ola Bademosi scored the lone touchdown, but a missed extra point led to a Vikings win, and the end of Trinity's season.\nOverall records.\n\"Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\""

        "text": "The second Grand Prix of the Royal Automobile Club, commonly referred to as the 1927 British Grand Prix, was a Grand Prix motor race held at the Brooklands circuit on 1 October 1927. It was the fifth and final race of the 1927 AIACR World Manufacturers' Championship season. The race was won by French driver Robert Benoist. It was his fourth victory from the season's five races, a performance that put the seal on his Delage team's already-unassailable lead in the Championship.\nA similar circuit was used as in the race the previous year, that is using the Finishing Straight, on which two sandbank chicanes were constructed. However, the footbridge across the Finishing Straight, which in 1926 had two supports on the track itself, had been rebuilt as a single-span, which enabled the full width of the straight to be used and allowed the layout of the chicane at the top of the Finishing Straight to be altered. The race itself also started half-way around the circuit, on the Railway Straight, rather than from the 1926 start at the junction of the Finishing Straight and the Members' Banking, meaning that the race distance was actually 124 and a half laps.\nClassification.\nNote: Fastest lap wasn't recorded."

        "title": "2012 IIHF World Championship",
        "text": "The 2012 IIHF World Championship was the 76th IIHF World Championship, an annual international ice hockey tournament. It took place between 4–20 May 2012 in Helsinki, Finland and Stockholm, Sweden. This tournament determined the countries' seeding for the men's Olympic Ice Hockey tournament in Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics, and for all countries participating in the qualification program leading up to the Olympics.\nRussia won the tournament by defeating Slovakia 6–2 in the Final game; the Russians finished the tournament undefeated with a record of 10–0–0, becoming the first team to win every game in regulation since the Soviet Union in the 1989 World Championships. The Czech Republic captured the bronze medal by defeating co-host Finland 3–2 in the bronze medal game. The tournament's top scorer, Russia's Evgeni Malkin, was named the most valuable player of the tournament.\nHost selection.\nAt the IIHF congress in Moscow in 2007 four nations submitted bids to host the 2012 World Championship: Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The Hungarian and Czech bids were withdrawn before the vote, which was then contested by Finland and Sweden. Finland won with 64 votes to Sweden's 35. Sweden later won the vote to host the 2013 World Championship. At the congress in Bern in 2009, it was announced that Finland and Sweden would instead co-host both the 2012 and 2013 tournaments.\nKimmo Leinonen served as the general secretary of the jointly-hosted events. \nVenues.\nGroup A preliminary round and quarterfinals were played in Hartwall Areena, Helsinki. Group B preliminary round and quarterfinals were played in Ericsson Globe, Stockholm. All semifinal and medal games were played at the Hartwall Areena.\nFormat.\nFor the first time since 2000, a new format was adopted in the IIHF World Hockey Championships. The preliminary round and qualification round were merged into one (two pools of eight teams), with the top four teams from each pool advancing to the quarterfinals.\nRosters.\nEach team's roster for the 2012 IIHF World Championship consisted of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 22 skaters and 3 goaltenders. All sixteen participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, had to submit a roster by the first IIHF directorate meeting.\nSummary.\nPreliminary round.\nThis group saw the three favourites, Canada, the United States and Finland advance pretty easily. All three teams advanced a day before the group play was done. Canada lost just one game, their second game, against the Americans in overtime. The Americans themselves needed to win their last game against Switzerland to capture the second place in the group ahead of Finland and did so with the result being 5–2. For the final spot of advancing, Slovakia and France played in a \"final\", where France needed a win to advance to the quarterfinals. The game was close throughout, tied the whole way until it was 4–4, this is when Slovakia scored the final and decisive goal to win 5–4 and get to the fourth spot in the group. France, Switzerland were eliminated alongside Belarus, with Kazakhstan finishing in the last spot and being relegated. They ended the tournament with one point, by losing to the United States in overtime.\nCanada faced Slovakia, and the United States played against Finland in the quarterfinals.\nRussia went through the group undefeated by winning all seven games. Co-host Sweden captured the second place, after falling short to Russia. Czech Republic rounded up the third place and advanced to the quarterfinals. Norway, Latvia and Germany all fought for the last spot in the next round but Germany was eliminated after failing miserably 4–12 to Norway. Latvia lost to Denmark and was eliminated, which meant that Norway advanced. Italy finished last and was relegated to Division I.\nIn the quarterfinals, Russia took on Norway, while Sweden battled the Czech Republic.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe Slovak team was the underdog going against Team Canada who had lost just one game so far. But the game started with a surprising strong start by Slovakia, who scored twice in the first 10 minutes to get a 2–0 lead. Evander Kane was able to cut into the lead before going into the first break. In the second period Canada scored twice and got the lead and Slovakia was down by one going into the last period. With just 6 and a half minutes to go Milan Bartovič tied the game before Michal Handzuš even took the lead with a bit over two minutes to go. Canada pulled the goalie but was not able to connect against and lost 3–4. The crowd was stunned and the surprise perfect, Slovakia advanced to the semifinals while Canada was eliminated.\nThe undefeated Russian team added Alexander Semin and Alexander Ovechkin to their roster before the quarterfinals.\nOvechkin went right away and scored the equalizer after Per-Åge Skrøder gave Norway the lead. After Russia took the lead, Patrick Thoresen made it a tied game just 28 seconds after the second period started, with his 18th point of the tournament. The game went into the last period tied, 2–2. Not even one minute into the third period, Alexei Emelin gave Russia the lead. After Russia raised the lead to two, Ilya Nikulin finished Norway off by making it a 5–2 lead with just five minutes to go. Norway was outshot 45–21 and eliminated.\nCo-Host Finland tried to advance against the US-team who they lost to in the preliminary round. The first period ended scoreless, before Jesse Joensuu broke the tie, just to be answered 21 seconds later by Kyle Palmieri. With the game going 1–1 into the last period, the United States took the lead with under two minutes played. Mikko Koivu tied the game seven minutes before the end of the game. With everyone expecting an overtime, Jesse Joensuu struck again, just nine seconds before the end. The US pulled the goalie but never had another chance and were eliminated.\nThe last quarterfinals saw Co-host Sweden going up against the Czech team. The first period ended in a 2–1 lead for the Czech Republic after Sweden took the lead early on. Martin Erat scored and gave the Czechs a two-goal lead before Henrik Zetterberg cut into the lead 45 seconds before the end of the second period. Jonathan Ericsson continued the Swedish way of climbing back by tying the game just 45 seconds into the last period. Both teams had their chance in the next few minutes, Sweden hit the post and the Czechs failed to score against Viktor Fasth. 29 seconds before the end, Michálek took the puck away from a Swedish defender and scored. Sweden pulled the goalie and had one last chance but it was missed and the Czech advanced to the semifinals. The Czechs became the first team since Finland in 2000 to eliminate Sweden in a World Championship quarterfinal.\nSemifinals.\nSeven minutes into the game, Janne Niskala gave Finland the lead. Two goals from Evgeni Malkin brought Russia back into the game going into the first intermission. In the second period Alexander Ovechkin increased the lead to 3–1; a while later Malkin would increase Russia's lead to 4–1. Denis Kokarev then scored another goal and with Russia in control of the game, yet another after that. Four minutes before the end of the game Mikael Granlund scored the last goal of the game, as it ended 6–2 in favour of Russia although they were out-shot 23 to 31. Malkin was the player of the game with scoring a hat trick to give him 18 points for the tournament. Russia advanced to the final to try to win their twenty-sixth title, while Finland will battle for bronze.\nThe Slovak team tried to continue their ride at this championship by advancing to the final even though the Czech team was the favorite before the game started. The game started slow, but Miroslav Šatan broke the tie 15 minutes into the game to give Slovakia the lead. Another 15 minutes in, this time the second period, Michael Frolík made it a 1–1 game going into the last period. The third period was not more than one minute old, when Šatan struck again with his second goal, despite Slovakia being shorthanded. Libor Hudáček then gave Slovakia a two-goal lead four minutes later. The Czech team had 15 minutes to turn the game around but did not create enough opportunities. They pulled their goaltender with two minutes to go, but Slovakia kept up their defense well enough not to concede another goal. Slovakia finished off another upset and advanced to the final, while the Czech Republic plays in the bronze medal game. Slovakia had no penalties but was outshot by nine.\nBronze medal game.\nThe bronze medal game featured Finland and the Czech Republic. The Czechs took the lead in the first period before Finland tied the game at one, three minutes before the first break. Jiří Novotný and David Krejčí raised the lead to two goals, being 3–1 at the first intermission. The second period went scoreless before the Finnish team got new hope when Jussi Jokinen scored a goal ten minutes before the end of the game. But they did not score again, and the Czech team captured the bronze medal and Finland ended the tournament in fourth place.\nGold medal game.\nThe gold medal game featured Russia and Slovakia. Slovakia played in the World Championship final game for the first time since 2002, while Russia advanced to their fourth gold medal game in the last five years. Russia defeated Slovakia 6–2 to take home the gold medal from the tournament. The Russian team went through the tournament undefeated.\nNations.\nThe following 16 nations qualified for the elite-pool tournament. 13 nations from Europe, 2 nations from North America and 1 nation from Asia are represented.\nOfficials.\nThe IIHF selected 16 referees and 16 linesmen to work the 2012 IIHF World Championship. They were the following:\nSeeding and groups.\nThe seeding in the preliminary round was based on the 2011 IIHF World Ranking, which ended at the conclusion of the 2011 IIHF World Championship. The teams were grouped accordingly by seeding (in parentheses is the corresponding world ranking):\nGroup H (Helsinki)\nGroup S (Stockholm)\nPreliminary round.\nThe top four teams in each group moved to the quarterfinals where the group winner met the fourth place, and the group runner-up met the third place within the same group. The last placed team in each group was relegated to Division I, Group A.\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal standings.\nThe official IIHF final standings of the tournament:\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top skaters sorted by points, then goals.

The game featured the second-ranked California Golden Bears of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) against the #4 Alabama Crimson Tide of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), two of the top teams from the 1937 college football season. This game was the fifth trip to Pasadena for the Tide, which had gone without a loss in the previous four.\nGame summary.\nThe game was a Vic Bottari and Sam Chapman show, as the duo combined for all 13 points. It was Alabama's first loss in the Rose Bowl, which prompted former \"Los Angeles Examiner\" reporter Maxwell Stiles to write: “The Crimson Tide was at its ebb, Alabama at last had lost a Rose Bowl Game.”\nAftermath.\nCalifornia's record in the Rose Bowl improved to 2–1–1, but this remains their most recent victory, with four losses since. The Golden Bears' next appearance was eleven years away, and the most recent was in January 1959.\nAlabama's record in Pasadena dropped to 3–1–1; their next Rose Bowl was a win in January 1946, the last edition prior to the exclusive agreement with the Big Nine (now Big Ten). The Tide played in three major bowls in between, with two wins."

        "title": "2010 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2010 British Grand Prix (formally the 2010 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was the tenth race of the 2010 Formula One season. On 7 December 2009, it was confirmed that the race would take place at Silverstone for the next seventeen years after the failure of Donington Park to raise the necessary funds to hold the race. The event was staged on 11 July, the same day as the 2010 FIFA World Cup final (as also happened in 1990 and 1998).\nThe race was won by Red Bull driver Mark Webber, taking his third victory of the season.\nThis was the last time until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix that Ferrari did not score a point.\nRace location.\nThe 2009 British Grand Prix was due to be the last held at the Silverstone Circuit. Donington Park was due to hold the race from 2010 but was unable to find the money to redevelop its circuit due to financial problems. On 29 October 2009 Bernie Ecclestone confirmed that there will be no British Grand Prix at Donington Park. Silverstone subsequently signed a 17-year deal to hold the race from 2010 onwards. Under this deal, the pit lane and paddock will be redeveloped with work starting as soon as possible after Christmas 2009 to be completed in 2011. The new track layout for the race featured a new complex of corners known as the \"Arena\" layout. The new corners from Abbey have been named; Farm, Village, The Loop, Aintree and the Wellington Straight leading to Brooklands on the old layout. This was also the last race to use the pit complex between Woodcote and Copse corners; the basic structure of the new complex was visible between Club and Abbey, and was used for the first time the following year.\nReport.\nBackground.\nSakon Yamamoto returned to a race seat after Hispania Racing decided to drop Bruno Senna in favour of the former Super Aguri and Spyker driver for reasons that remained undisclosed as the weekend began. Team principal Colin Kolles claimed that the switch was not related to sponsorship; the only new sponsor for the team was the Jaypee Group, owners of the new Jaypee Group Circuit in India, and attracted to the team by Karun Chandhok. Senna refused to speak on the subject, whilst Yamamoto claimed he would \"talk\" to the Brazilian driver, prompting speculation that the team was experiencing internal troubles and that Yamamoto's appointment had come after Senna had criticised the team in an internal e-mail. Nevertheless, the team refused to comment on why the change had been made and confirmed that Senna would return to his seat at Hockenheim.\nOther line-up changes for the first practice session saw Paul di Resta stand in for Vitantonio Liuzzi at Force India and Fairuz Fauzy take over Jarno Trulli's driving duties at Lotus. The race also saw Virgin bring their most significant upgrade of the season, whilst Lotus brought their final update for 2010 as the team shifted its focus to the 2011 car. Meanwhile, McLaren introduced their interpretation of the blown diffuser concept pioneered by Red Bull at the start of the season and debuted by Ferrari and Mercedes at the , only for the Woking-based team to abandon it after struggling during Friday practice.\nThe new addition to the circuit was well-received, but several drivers requested that changes be made to the high kerbs through the Maggotts-Becketts complex, one of the fastest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar.\nThe drivers' representative on the stewards' panel was Nigel Mansell.\nFree practice.\nThe Friday free practice sessions marked the first time the drivers experienced the new layout. The reception was mixed, with Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso enthusiastic about it, while Robert Kubica and Heikki Kovalainen expressed a preference for the older circuit. Almost every driver commented on a large bump on the approach to the reprofiled Abbey turn, with some drivers claiming it was potentially better than Copse corner.\nThe Friday sessions were once again dominated by the Red Bulls, with Vettel posting the fastest time in the first session and Webber in the second. The new layout caught several drivers out, with Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher running wide at Abbey. Whether a byproduct of the new layout or another factor, the Friday session produced some unusual times, with the Ferraris of Alonso and Massa struggling to find any real pace in the first session, whilst Renault's Vitaly Petrov was quicker than teammate Kubica. In both sessions, just four drivers were within a second of the leader. Elsewhere, the new teams experienced troubles. While Lotus' Heikki Kovalainen slowly ate away at the difference to the established teams, Sakon Yamamoto was the slowest of the twenty-four drivers, seven and a half seconds off the pace. After surrendering his car to test driver Fairuz Fauzy for the first session, Jarno Trulli was hampered by reliability problems and limiting his time on the new layout before Kovalainen's car expired on the circuit late in the session.\nThe third and final session on Saturday morning continued the trend, with Sebastian Vettel returning to the top of the time sheets, with Mark Webber a close second; both drivers were the only two men to break the 1min 31sec barrier all weekend. Several drivers were hampered with mechanical issues, with Trulli losing more time to hydraulics problems, as did Adrian Sutil. Timo Glock also had little on-track time after this VR-01 fell victim to a throttle problem. Vettel also suffered his own mechanical problem when his front wing detached itself on the high-speed approach to Abbey late in the hour. The young German driver was able to slow the car down and prevent an accident, and his time remained unbeaten for the last few minutes of the session.\nQualifying.\nThe beginning of qualifying was marked by controversy following Vettel's wing failure. Red Bull had brought a new aerodynamic package to the race that included a new front wing, and team principal Christian Horner made the decision to remove the new front wing from Webber's car and give it to Vettel. This prompted an angry outburst from the Australian, with public perception being that Red Bull had robbed Webber for the sake of favouring Vettel, particularly following the aftermath of their collision in Istanbul. Otherwise, the first session saw the elimination of Jaime Alguersuari and the Lotuses, Virgins and Hispanias. Timo Glock edged out Kovalainen in the dying moments to qualify as the best of the newcomers, only to have Kovalainen take the place back moments later.\nThe second session saw the elimination of Jenson Button, with commentator Martin Brundle noting that the McLaren MP4-25 was incredibly rough over the bumps in the circuit, particularly on the approach to the new section. The Renaults of Robert Kubica and Vitaly Petrov also struggled despite their promising form in practice, and while Kubica just made it through to Q3, Petrov's session ended early when the car developed a fuel problem. Although the team were able to get the Russian out for one final lap at the end of the session, it was a sedate effort that only elevated him to sixteenth. Following the worst qualifying performance of his career in Valencia, Michael Schumacher set the fifth-fastest time of the session, with the team attributing their recent run of poor results to upgrading the car without fully understanding the effects of their new parts. Vitantonio Liuzzi was issued with a five-place penalty after qualifying for impeding Nico Hülkenberg when the Italian violently cut across the Williams driver as he made a mistake at Abbey. At the end of the session, Adrian Sutil had qualified eleventh, ahead of Kamui Kobayashi, Hülkenberg, Button, Petrov and Sébastien Buemi, with Liuzzi relegated to twentieth place after his penalty.\nThe final session was dominated by Red Bull, with Vettel and Webber going blow-for-blow. The German prevailed by a tenth of a second, prompting Webber's outburst, with the Australian expressing extreme dissatisfaction with lining up on the dirty side of the grid, which had traditionally been a bad starting place at Silverstone. Fernando Alonso out-qualified Lewis Hamilton after the Briton somehow managed to overcome the troubles experienced by teammate Button, with Nico Rosberg fifth. Despite earlier problems – suspected of being related to the car being caught in a crosswind – Robert Kubica managed sixth ahead of Felipe Massa, Rubens Barrichello and Pedro de la Rosa, the Spaniard's first time in Q3 all season. Michael Schumacher had to settle for the tenth and final place on the grid after only doing one lap as he had only had one set of tyres left over.\nIn addition to Liuzzi's penalty, Jaime Alguersuari was fined five thousand dollars for an unsafe pit release, and Sakon Yamamoto was warned for slowing other drivers.\nRace.\nThe race began with Sebastian Vettel attempting to force teammate Webber into yielding on the approach to Copse corner, but the Australian prevailed and Vettel ran wide as he made contact with Lewis Hamilton in third. As the field passed through the Maggotts-Becketts corner, Vettel was seen to run wide, having picked up a puncture from the contact with Hamilton as Webber and the Briton escaped the rest of the field. Other first-lap incidents saw Felipe Massa earn a puncture after contact in the new section, and the two drivers were forced to pit, shunting them to the back end of the field.\nThe first casualty of the race was Lucas di Grassi, his VR-01 once again crippled by hydraulics failure, while at the front of the pack, Hamilton kept in touch with Webber as they raced on the softer tyre. His teammate Button was able to carve his way through the field, having started fourteenth. The early phase of the race was marked by another minor stewarding controversy as Fernando Alonso attempted to pass the struggling Robert Kubica on the entry to Vale. Alonso was forced off the circuit and recovered to take the second half of Club corner, but passed Kubica in the process. Alonso was given a drive-through penalty for failing to give the place back to Kubica, but problems began when Adrian Sutil made contact with Pedro de la Rosa on the main straight. Although both drivers were able to continue for the time being, de la Rosa's rear wing was damaged and it started to disintegrate as the Sauber took to the Hangar straight. He pitted and was released back into the race, but it was a mortal wound and de la Rosa was forced to retire. The debris on the circuit at the approach to Stowe prompted the deployment of the safety car, bunching the field back up. This was a problem for Alonso because he was unable to serve his drive-through penalty until after the safety car had withdrawn, sending him plummeting back down the order. Reactions from the commentators were unsympathetic, with many feeling that Alonso could have avoided trouble by giving the place back to Kubica at the earliest possible opportunity. Nevertheless, it was still described as a harsh penalty because Kubica had been forced out of the race with driveshaft problems before the de la Rosa-Sutil incident. Charlie Whiting, the FIA's race director, later told reporters that Alonso and Ferrari had been advised to yield to Kubica as soon as the Spaniard had passed the Renault, and twice more after that before the penalty was issued. Ferrari later released a timeline of the Alonso-Kubica pass and following events, showing that Charlie Whiting had told them he \"had to look at pictures\" and did not recommend Alonso return the position until a full two minutes after the controversial pass (critically after Alonso had already passed Alguersuari). The decision not to allow Kubica pass immediately after was a key moment in the championship, the lost points ultimately cost Alonso the championship.\nThe unintended effect of the safety car deployment was that it bunched the field up again. Sebastian Vettel, who had been just three seconds ahead of Mark Webber on the road, was able to join the rear of the safety car train and proceeded to wage war against the rest of the grid, picking them off one by one. Several other battles also picked up, with Alonso and Liuzzi bashing wheels and Petrov threatening Nico Hülkenberg's tenth place until the Russian developed a slow puncture and was forced to pit. Meanwhile, Vettel continued his charge, made more complicated by the retirement of Jaime Alguersuari. The Toro Rosso driver beached himself at low speed on the outside of Luffield with eight laps to go, prompting marshalls to display yellow flags at the end of the new Wellington Straight and thus denying Vettel the opportunity to pass countryman Sutil into Brooklands. Vettel eventually bullied his way through, forcing a gap at Aintree several laps later. Sutil was left unimpressed by the pass as he came under fire from Schumacher, who himself had to fend off the tenth-placed Nico Hülkenberg.\nMark Webber claimed line honours as the first man home, just over a second ahead of Lewis Hamilton. Nico Rosberg claimed third place, Mercedes' first podium since the , with Jenson Button missing out on the winner's rostrum by half a second. Rubens Barrichello led Kamui Kobayashi across the line before the German quartet of Vettel, Sutil, Schumacher and Hülkenberg completed the points. The Ferraris of Alonso and Massa finished fourteenth and fifteenth, one minute down and the last drivers to finish on the lead lap. Jarno Trulli was the first driver for the new teams to finish, ahead of teammate Kovalainen and the sole surviving Virgin of Glock and the two Hispanias. Despite being classified two laps behind race winner Webber, Timo Glock was within sight of the Lotuses when he crossed the line as the Australian had passed him close to the end of the final lap.\nPost-race.\nRace winner Mark Webber was still outspoken about the apparent favouritism within the Red Bull team; his first words after crossing the line were, \"Fantastic, guys, not bad for a number two driver. Cheers.\", whilst in the press conference he expressed dissatisfaction with the team, claiming that he never would have signed a contract for 2011 if he had known he would have been treated the way he had been. Elsewhere, Ferrari and Alonso accepted their penalty for the pass on Kubica, claiming that if harsh penalties were to be issued, then Silverstone was an example of how it should be done, briefly reigniting the controversy associated with the previous race.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Asahi (baseball team)",
        "text": "The Asahi was a Japanese-Canadian baseball team of amateur and semi-professional players that was based in Vancouver from 1914 to 1941. The team won many league championships, particularly in the 1930s.\nHistory.\nThe Asahi was established as a senior team in 1914, under its first manager and coach, Matsujiro Miyazaki. Team members included both issei and nisei. These include the notable players: Yo (Yoshitaro) Horii, Mickey (Hatsu) Kitagawa, and Tom Matoba. After 1918, Asahi was the sole Japanese Canadian team after the Vancouver Nippon team disbanded. Many of Vancouver Nippon's players joined the Asahi. The team was based in Vancouver's Oppenheimer Park—originally known as the Powell Street Grounds—in the city's Japantown.\nCoach Miyazaki, who was raised in Japan, was largely influential to the team’s enduring success. He incorporated Japanese strategies into his coaching, which was dubbed “smartball” or “brainball” by the media, due to its reliance on speed and defense as opposed to power and heavy hitting. This strategy was devised to capitalize on the player’s small frames. Bunting, cutoff and base-stealing were among their most popular strategies, and emphasized teamwork to create an impenetrable defense.\nRacism.\nAsahi was active during a time of harsh anti-Asian racism. While players were praised in the media, they experienced racism in their everyday lives including limited employment opportunities and segregation in places like movie theatres. The success of the Asahi, in spite of these hardships, made the team a symbol of Japanese Canadian perseverance and cultural participation. The team has contributed to closing off the intergenerational gap between the issei and the children born during the interwar period. The team helped to mediate the relationship between Japanese Canadians and the white community by creating a common interest that brought the two together. During a time of prominent racial discrimination, Oppenheimer Park became a place where barriers fell as the Asahi and Occidental fans would support one another. The Asahi's style of play and determination on the field gave them \"grudging respect\" from European-Canadian fans. \nAfter the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Canada invoked the 1914 War Measures Act and all Canadians of Japanese descent were registered as ‘enemy aliens’ and forcibly moved in internment camps. This resulted in the disbanding of the Asahi team. They never played as a team again. \nLegacy.\nThe team was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003, and the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. The team was designated an Event of National Historic Significance on August 26, 2008. A plaque honoring the team was unveiled in Oppenheimer Park on September 18, 2011, the 70th anniversary of the team's last game. On April 24, 2019, the team was honoured with a postage stamp issued by Canada Post.\nIn media.\nIn December 2014, a Japanese studio released a period drama movie called \"The Vancouver Asahi\" starring Satoshi Tsumabuki and Kazuya Kamenashi. The film premiered at the Vancouver International Film Festival, receiving the Top Audience Award, and was released in theatres on December 20.\nA 2003 documentary about the team, \"Sleeping Tigers: The Asahi Baseball Story\", was directed by Jari Osborne. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, the documentary combines archival film and dramatic recreations, along with interviews with the last of the Asahi. The 50-minute film garnered four awards including a Rockie Award for Best Sports Program at the Banff Television Festival and a Golden Sheaf Award.\n\"Heart of a Champion\" is a 2016 novel by Ellen Schwartz. The story is about a boy named Kenji \"Kenny\" Sakamoto who aspires to be a baseball player for the Vancouver Asahi, but his dreams were crushed when the Canadian government issued an order for all Japanese Canadians to be placed in internment camps, then got permission to clear the land and make a baseball field. The novel has won a Silver Birch Award.\nOn February 19, 2019, a Heritage Minute was released, depicting an Asahi baseball game and the subsequent internment of a player alongside other Japanese Canadians. The short segment was narrated by the last surviving member of the team, Koichi Kaye Kaminishi, and novelist Joy Kogawa.\nNotable alumni.\nMatsujiro Miyasaki was the team's first manager. He was known for his \"Small Ball\" strategy, which included their signature double steal. He emphasized speed and flawless defense.\nRoy Yamamura was a regular with the team from 1924-1941. He became the team's manager in 1938 while he continued to play for the club. He was a fan favourite due to his prolific base stealing and defensive ability, which earned him the nickname \"the dancing shortstop\". He is the only Japanese Canadian to play for the Arrows team in Vancouver's top division for two years.\nKaye Koichi Kaminishi is the last known survivor from the team. He played between 1939 and 1941.\nKaz Suga was a star player during the team's last season in 1941. He had a batting average of 0.395 and was an expectation to the team's \"smartball\" playstyle.\nJunji Ito was one of the Asahi Baseball team's legendary players. He became known as the 'King of Bunting' as his batting average climbed to over 0.400 and on the bases, his reactions were almost instant. He modelled the \"smartball\" strategy to perfection."

The club is a member of the Tasmanian Rugby Union, affiliated with the Australian Rugby Union, and plays in the Tasmanian Statewide League men's First Division.\nThe club's home ground is at Upper Burnie sports centre in the Burnie, Tasmania. Known as \"the Emus\", the club colours are blue and red. The club fields a team in Men's First Division along with a Women's team in the statewide competition.\nHistory - post-reformation.\nThe club was reformed in 1997 after a seven-year absence from competition. With the encouragement of Ron Willet, a prop forward and Northern Tasmanian President from Launceston, meetings commenced with Ken Allan &amp; Shane Bentley at Burnie’s Beach hotel. Former Burnie president Brett \"Crusty\" Kershaw came on board as player and treasurer. Peter Letcher was recruited as coach for the side. Warren and Robbie Taylor came on board as manager and secretary respectively.\nPast player Fergie Baird assisted in locating some lost funds that had been set aside for future club use. Kershaw paid for the club's first insurance bill and the Emus were reestablished.\nThe Northern Competition at that time comprised Burnie, Devonport, two Launceston teams, Georgetown, and the West Coast Miners (the last two are now defunct). The Emus played in the Acton Rugby and Softball ground which they shared in and developed. In 2003 the club moved to the Montello Sporting Grounds, the home of the Burnie United Soccer Club. After six years the club parted ways with Montello and moved to the McKenna Park Regional Sporting Complex in early 2009.\nBurnie has played in three Northern Grand Finals since 1997, winning one in 2003 defeating Launceston at Montello Sporting Ground in a memorable 14 -10. Big Willie Johnson scored the winning try under the posts with Josh Baldwin converting to secure the victory on the day. Burnie had narrowly lost in two grand finals to the Devonport Bulls. \nIn 2008 after its first season of the Statewide Second Division, Burnie won the championship with a more than convincing victory over Glenorchy.\nIn 2009 the Emus participated in the revised Statewide First Division Competition. Burnie is back in the Statewide First Division after a 20-year absence.\nOfficials.\nThe current President is Isabella Hardy, the first female and youngest person to ever take on the role. Women's coach Brett \"Crusty\" Kershaw is Vice President. Vanessa Davies is the current Secretary and Melissa Coull is the Treasurer. \nPremierships.\nSenior Team"

He was selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 25th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft but chose to play college baseball at Cal State Fullerton. Johnson set Fullerton's career record for strikeouts with 365 and was named the Pitcher of the Year in the Big West Conference in 2000. That year, he was selected by the Twins with the second pick in the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.\nAt the time of the draft, John Sickels wrote on ESPN.com that Johnson \"[s]hould move through the minors quickly.\" Indeed, Johnson made his Major League Baseball debut just over a year later on July 16, 2001, against the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing three earned runs over six innings pitched. Johnson gave up 14 runs in his next 15 innings pitched and was replaced on the roster by outfielder Bobby Kielty. The Twins brought Johnson up again when rosters expanded in September. He finished the season with an earned run average (ERA) of 8.28.\nIn 2002, Johnson failed to make the Twins out of spring training. When he was given his assignment papers, he tore or crumpled them and stormed out of manager Ron Gardenhire's office. He spent the entire season in Triple-A with the Edmonton Trappers.\nIn 2003, Johnson was called up to the big leagues for the first time once the rosters expanded on September 1 after a full season at Triple-A Rochester. He appeared in two games that season. On September 28, he pitched in what would be his final Major League game and gave up six earned runs in a third of an inning pitched.\nJohnson pitched until 2008 in the Oakland Athletics farm system, in the Mexican League with the Pericos de Puebla and in the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and Golden Baseball League.\nJohnson was widely considered a draft bust after the conclusion of his career."

Despite being English born there was a two-year residency rule that allowed non-Welsh born players representing the Wales national team, and in 1895 he was selected to represent Wales as part of the Home Nations Championship. Elsey was brought into the Welsh pack for the Championship opener against England. The Welsh team had changed much since the previous match of the lase season, with only six of the original fifteen reselected, though only Elsey and Swansea's Tom Jackson were new caps amongst the forwards. The match was played at St. Helen's, Swansea with Wales led out by Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, in a team that contained over 100 caps from just seven players, against an English team fielding 10 new caps. Despite being in a far more experienced team, Elsey found himself on the losing side as the English won 14-6, scoring four tries. The Welsh points game from two tries, one of which was scored by Elsey. Even with a score on his international debut, Elsey was replaced for the next match of the Championship by Ernie George and never represented Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "David Andrews (born October 4, 1948) is a Canadian ice hockey executive and former player. He is chairman of the Board of Governors and former president of the American Hockey League (AHL), the primary developmental circuit for the National Hockey League. He has been inducted into the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame (2005), the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame (2006), and the American Hockey League Hall of Fame (2021). In 2010, Andrews was a recipient of the Lester Patrick Award for contributions to hockey in the United States.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Nova Scotia, Andrews attended King's-Edgehill School in Windsor, Nova Scotia, then went on to Dalhousie University in Halifax and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he excelled in varsity hockey at these institutions as a goaltender, garnering multiple conference all-star status. After graduation, he played four years of professional hockey in the Netherlands.\nCareer.\nAndrews became the hockey development coordinator for the province of British Columbia in 1975 and served in this capacity for five years until joining the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League as a coach. In this time, Andrews coached numerous players who became NHL standouts, including future Hall of Fame goaltender Grant Fuhr, and the Cougars were WHL champions in 1981. He took over as head coach and Director of Hockey Operations for the Cougars in 1982. In addition to his involvement with the Cougars, Andrews was on the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association's Developmental Council for 10 years and was Chairman of its Coaching Committee. He was the first head coach of Canada's National under-18 program in 1982. From 1984 to 1987, he served as a senior consultant with Sport Canada working with five national winter sport organizations in preparing their athletes for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.\nFrom 1987 to 1994, Andrews was the director of AHL operations for the Edmonton Oilers and guided the Oilers' AHL affiliates, the Nova Scotia Oilers and Cape Breton Oilers. This period was highlighted by Andrews being awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award in 1990 as the AHL's outstanding executive, the Cape Breton Oilers setting a record with 36 sellouts in the 1990–91 season, and the Oilers capturing the 1993 Calder Cup as AHL champions.\nAndrews assumed the presidency of the AHL in 1994, taking over from longtime president Jack Butterfield. Under Andrews, the league saw record levels of attendance and exposure while expanding its geography across the United States and Canada. During his tenure, the AHL became the sole primary development league for all National Hockey League organizations, serving as a training ground for players, coaches, executives, on-ice officials, broadcasters, and training staff.\nIn 2001, Andrews led one of the largest expansion efforts in professional sports, bringing nine new cities into the AHL including six from the folding International Hockey League. In 2015, Andrews managed the process of relocating five AHL franchises to California, allowing for the creation of a Pacific Division to better meet the needs of western-based NHL organizations. The Pacific Division has since grown to include teams in Tucson, Arizona; Loveland, Colorado; Henderson, Nevada; and, in 2022, Palm Desert, California.\nLeague attendance has climbed dramatically, more than doubling from 2.9 million in the final season before his term began in 1994 to more than 7 million annually. The league also grew its television presence airing on national networks such as Sportsnet, CBC, TSN, NHL Network, ESPN2, and CBS Sports Network, as well as on satellite radio and the internet through live video streaming. The All-Star Classic was also re-introduced in 1995 after a 35-year absence, and Andrews coordinated the unique 2014 event that saw the AHL's best host renowned Swedish club team Färjestad BK.\nAndrews has contributed to the growth of hockey by playing a leadership role in rules innovations — such as hybrid icing and 4-on-4 and later 3-on-3 overtime play — and player safety initiatives. The AHL has instituted safety standards relative to head checking and checking from behind; introduced mandatory visors for all skaters; and provided a safer environment for its players by adopting a modified schedule that reduced the number of games played, increased the length of the playing calendar and eliminated sequences of teams playing four games in five days.\nOn the business front, Andrews has grown corporate and broadcast partnerships to new levels, built strong platforms for the league’s special events such as the All-Star Classic and Calder Cup Finals, and has overseen dramatic increases in league-wide revenues and franchise values.\nRetirement.\nOn May 6, 2019, the AHL announced that Andrews would retire on June 30, 2020, following the end of the 2019–20 season; Scott Howson was elected as Andrews' successor on February 14, 2020, with Andrews set to assume the role of chairman of the board of governors on July 1, 2020.\nAccolades.\nAndrews was inducted into the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame in 2006.\nIn 2010, Andrews was a recipient of the prestigious Lester Patrick Trophy for contributions to hockey in the United States. In 2020, following his 26-year tenure as league president, the AHL awarded him the 2020 Thomas Ebright Memorial Award for outstanding career contributions to the league.\nAndrews currently serves on the executive committee of the Hockey Canada Foundation, as vice-chair of the board of governors of King's-Edgehill School in Nova Scotia, and as chairman of the selection committee for the Order of Hockey in Canada. He is also a former adjunct professor of sport management at Springfield College.\nIn 2021, Andrews was inducted into the AHL Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Freestyle swimming",
        "text": "Freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of the International Swimming Federation (FINA), in which competitors are subject to only a few limited restrictions on their swimming stroke. Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions, with distances beginning with and reaching , also known as the mile. The term 'freestyle stroke' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl', as front crawl is the fastest surface swimming stroke. It is now the most common stroke used in freestyle competitions.\nThe first Olympics held open water swimming events, but after a few Olympics, closed water swimming was introduced. The front crawl or freestyle was the first event that was introduced.\nTechnique.\nFreestyle swimming implies the use of legs and arms for competitive swimming, except in the case of the individual medley or medley relay events. The front crawl is most commonly chosen by swimmers, as this provides the greatest speed. During a race, the competitor circles the arms forward in alternation, kicking the feet up and down (flutter kick). Individual freestyle events can also be swum using one of the officially regulated strokes (breaststroke, butterfly, or backstroke). For the freestyle part of medley swimming competitions, however, one cannot use breaststroke, butterfly, or backstroke. Front crawl is based on the Trudgen that was improved by Richmond Cavill from Sydney, Australia. Cavill developed the stroke by observing a young boy from the Solomon Islands, Alick Wickham. Cavill and his brothers spread the Australian crawl to England, New Zealand and America, creating the freestyle used worldwide today. During the Olympic Games, front crawl is swum almost exclusively during freestyle. Some of the few rules state that swimmers must touch the end of the pool during each length and cannot push off the bottom, hang on the wall, or pull on the lane lines during the course of the race. However, other than this any form or variation of strokes is considered legal with the race. As with all competitive events, false starts can lead to disqualification of the swimmer.\nNew developments in the sport.\nTimes have consistently dropped over the years due to better training techniques and to new developments in the sport.\nIn the first four Olympics, swimming competitions were not held in pools, but in open water (1896 – the Mediterranean, 1900 – the Seine river, 1904 – an artificial lake, 1906 – the Mediterranean). The 1904 Olympics freestyle race was the only one ever measured at 100 yards, instead of the usual 100 meters. A 100-meter pool was built for the 1908 Olympics and sat in the center of the main stadium's track and field oval. The 1912 Olympics, held in the Stockholm harbor, marked the beginning of electronic timing.\nMale swimmers wore full body suits up until the 1940s, which caused more drag in the water than their modern swimwear counterparts. Also, over the years, some design considerations have reduced swimming resistance, making the pool faster, namely: proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy-absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic, and illumination designs.\nThe 1924 Olympics was the first to use the standard 50 meter pool with marked lanes. In freestyle events, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were eventually incorporated at the 1936 Olympics. The flip turn was developed in the 1950s, resulting in faster times. Lane design created in the early 1970s has also cut down turbulence in water, aiding in the more dynamic pool used today.\nRules and regulation.\nFreestyle means \"any style\" for individual swims and any style but breaststroke, butterfly, or backstroke for both the individual medley, and medley relay competitions. The wall has to be touched at every turn and upon completion. Some part of the swimmer must be above water at any time, except for the first 15 meters after the start and every turn. This rule was introduced (see History of swimming) to prevent swimmers from using the faster underwater swimming, such as the fish kick, to their advantage, or even swimming entire laps underwater. The exact FINA rules are:\nCompetitions.\nThere are nine competitions used in freestyle swimming, both using either a long time (50 meter) or a short time (25 meter) pool. The United States also employs short time yards (25 yard pool). In the United States, it is common for swimmers to compete in a 25-yard pool during the Fall, Winter, and Spring, and then switch over to a 50-meter pool format during the Summer.\nYoung swimmers (typically 8 years old and younger) have the option to swim a 25 yard/meter freestyle event.\nFreestyle is also part of the medley over the following distances:\nIn the long-distance races of the , some meets hosted by FINA (including the Olympics) only have the distance for women and the distance for men. However, FINA does keep records in the distance for women and the distance for men, and the FINA World Championships, as well as many other meets, have both distances for both sexes."

        "text": "Rugby union in Serbia is a minor but growing sport. The game was first played in Belgrade after the first World War and was revived again in the 1950s. Serbia currently has 12 rugby clubs and around 2,000 players.\nGoverning body.\nThe Rugby Union of Serbia (Рагби Савез Србије) is the national governing body for the sport. It has been a member of World Rugby (formerly the IRB) since 1988.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1918 to 1931.\nThe first known Serbian rugby players were students at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, Scotland during the First World War. On March 8, 1918, they played the first unofficial international game against students from a British Colonies and won by eight points to three in front of 10,000 spectators. Notable players were Toma Tomic from Leskovac, Dimitrije Dulkanovic from Cuprija and Danilo Pavlovic from Prokuplje. \nUnder the name Serbians they played games against Edinburgh school teams - Royal High School, George Heriot's School, etc.\nAnother group of Serbian boys played rugby in Glasgow, in Hillhead High School. The best player was Slavoljub DJordjevic. From 1917 till 1926 he played more than 100 games for Hillhead High School, Hilhead High School FP and Glasgow University. \nIn Dundee three Serbian boys - Miodrag Dimitrijevic, Dusan Bozjakovic and Vladimir Orovic, played for the High School of Dundee. In total more than 30 Serbian boys played rugby football in UK during WW1.\nThe students returned to Serbia after the war and formed the \"Jugoslavija\" club in Belgrade and the \"Beli orao\" club in Sabac. By 1923, however, rugby activities had ceased due to a lack of available pitches. \nIn 1931 group of former students from Scotland - Toma Tomić, former George Heriot's School student, Krsta Balic, ex Hillhead High School and Milorad Jevdjovic, former Harris Academy, Dundee, formed Belgrade Rugby Club.\nRugby in Yugoslavia: 1953 to 1992.\nRugby was re-introduced to the country in the 1950s. A Belgrade team, RK Partizan, was formed in 1953 and a few months later the Radnicki club was formed. The first match between the two teams was played in April 1954 with Partizan winning 21–11.\nThe Rugby Championship of Yugoslavia ran from 1957 to 1992. Dinamo Pančevo won the first championship played in 1957, and later in '68, '69, '74 and '79. Dinamo Pančevo won the first Cup competition held that same year, in 1979. RK Partizan, won the second, third, and fourth titles in 1958 to '60 as well as the final two in '91 and '92 before the breakup of Yugoslavia.\nThe Yugoslavia national rugby union team played its first international in July 1968 against a Romanian XV, losing 3 points to 11. Through the 70s and 80s, Serbian players represented Yugoslavia together with players from Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. This came to an end in 1991 with the Yugoslav Wars which resulted in a gap of five years with no international rugby.\nPost-breakup: 1992 onward.\nThe Serbian clubs played in the Serbia and Montenegro Championship from the 1992–93 season through until 2005–06. The competition became the Rugby Championship of Serbia from 2006 to 2007 onwards.\nWhen the Yugoslav team reformed in 1996, it consisted of players from Serbia only and they played their first international against at Vršac in May of that year. From 2003 to mid 2006, they played as Serbia and Montenegro. After the two countries split in 2006, Serbia and Montenegro had their own national teams.\nSerbian national teams.\nThe first official international match played by the Serbia national rugby union team was in October 2006. The Serbia women's national rugby union team played their first international in 2007, but now mainly focus on rugby sevens. The men's and women's national teams (15s and 7s) compete mainly in European competitions.\nAs of February 2015, the Serbian national team was placed 84th in the World Rugby rankings.\nDomestic structure.\nThe teams in the Rugby Championship of Serbia as of 2021 are:\nTeams that previously participated in the Serbian Championship (senior and youth programs) include: RK Dorćol, RK Red Star, Balkan Mosquito, Royal Belgrade, RK Singidunum, RK Zmajevi, RK Palilulac, RK Leva obala, RK Borac (all from Belgrade),RK Petrovgrad (from Zrenjanin), RK Iron Fortress (from Smederevo), RK Giants (Gornji Milanovac), RK Morava gepardi (from Leskovac).

        "text": "Rugby union in Slovakia is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Slovak Rugby Union.\nHistory.\nRugby union was introduced to Czechoslovakia (as it was then) by the Czech/Moravian writer Ondřej Sekora, when he returned from living in France in 1926, with a rugby ball and set of rules. It developed during the interbellum, but was severely disrupted by the tribulations of World War II, and the Cold War.\nAlthough Slovakia was under the aegis of Czechoslovak rugby bodies, the centre of gravity was firmly in Bohemia and to a lesser extent Moravia, with Slovakia finishing a distant third in terms of participation. However, rugby union was being played in Bratislava by ŠK Slávia Bratislava as early as 1927.\nCzechoslovakia was a founder member of FIRA in 1934, and joined the IRB in 1988. The Czechoslovak Rugby Union was founded in 1926; after the Velvet Divorce, Slovakia founded its own in the 1990s.\nLike many minor European rugby nations, Slovak rugby has tended to centre on the capital: Bratislava, with fleeting starts in provincial towns and the countryside. It has a minor presence in one or two schools.\nRugby union is completely amateur in Slovakia, leading by RC Slovan Bratislava, club settled in the capital of Slovakia."

Although rugby union in Croatia was the main centre for the sport in Yugoslavia, there was still quite a bit of rugby played in Slovenia. The Rugby Championship of Yugoslavia ran from 1957-1991.\nPost independence.\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia broke up many of the Slovenian rugby structures, which had to be started afresh.\nIn the early 1990s, former Italian cap, Dr Giancarlo Tizanini was a major driving force in Austrian rugby. Before his death in 1994, he tried hard to establish a Central European equivalent of the Six Nations between Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia.\nSlovenia also borders Italy, which is a major rugby playing nation. In recent years, however, there have been serious attempts by rugby league to expand into the Balkans, using substantial financial incentives, and expats from Australia.\nClubs.\nAs of 2009, the following clubs were active:"

        "title": "Rugby union in Greece",
        "text": "Rugby union in Greece is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Greek Rugby Federation or Hellas Rugby Federation (ΕΟΡ).\nThe Hellenic Rugby Federation was set up in 2001, by those involved in rugby at the time and in 2004 at the instigation of the then Deputy Minister of Sport, George Orfanos, with the subsequent appointment of Dr Evangelos Stamos as President overthrowing the then first board (2001 - 2004). Τhe Greek government removed its administrative authority in 2014. From September 2014 to May 2023 the governing body was Hellenic Handball Federation, after the Greek Government withdrew sports representation authority from the Hellenic Rugby Federation (\"Ελληνικής Ομοσπονδίας Ράγκμπι\"), which was affiliated to World Rugby. Greece was suspended from World Rugby at the end of 2014 but was reinstated in May 2015 and has since been suspended again. An explanation has not been given for the suspension.\nIn May 2023, the Greek General Secretariat of Sports restored recognition of the Greek Rugby Federation.\nHistory.\nRugby first appears to have been played by British sailors in Greece, probably in the early 20th century. However, it has not been well organised until recently. The Greek Diaspora emigrated to many rugby playing countries, notably England, South Africa and Australia, and some of these people have returned or informed their family about the game. A second factor is that a number of British expatriates have come to live in Greece and some have set up clubs. However, these invariably are not very inclusive of native Greeks .\nRugby started developing in Greece during the 1990s, and the setting up of the HRU in October 2001, led to the national team participating in the European Nations Cup in 2005, and the establishment of annual league competitions from 2005 to the present. This is partly due to pressure from rugby league in Greece which has started aggressive recruitment in recent years, and has set up a national team composed mostly of Greek Australians, managed by Colin Mylonas, himself an Australian. Although rugby union has a much longer history in Greece, the Greek Rugby League was set up in 2003.\nDomestic Championship.\nThe domestic championship began in 2005–06 and has been dominated by Athens RFC who won the first four championships.\nIn 2005–06 Athens claimed the title in unsatisfactory manner when Rhodes Colossi were unable to get to the final in Athens because bad weather prevented their ferry from leaving Rhodes. Athens were thus given a walkover although in fairness they had dominated the season and were clear favourites to win.\nIn 2006–07, Athens and Rhodes again made it to the final which Athens won 19 – 0 at the Zirinio Stadium in Athens. The following year the championship was played as a straight league with no Grand Final - Athens comfortably won it with Attica Springboks finishing as runners-up.\nThe 2008–09 season again saw Athens emerging triumphant although only after an exciting final against Attica Springboks at the stadium in Glyka Nera which Athens won 22 – 18.\nSeven teams took part in the 2009–10 championship. These were Athens RFC, Athens Spartans, Attica Springboks, Iraklis Thessaloniki, Macedones Evosmos, Rhodes Colossi, Thessaloniki Lions. After a 44-match winning streak Athens were finally beaten by Rhodes on October 18, 2009."

The Cornhuskers were coached by Connie Yori. The Cornhuskers are a member of the Big 12 Conference and did not qualify for the NCAA tournament. Those hopes were tempered with the loss of two-time first-team All-Big 12 forward Kelsey Griffin to a season-ending ankle injury in late-August. Despite playing without Griffin, the Huskers fought their way to a 9-3 record early in the season that included a dramatic come-from-behind win over No. 24 Arizona State on Dec. 28. Nebraska, which had received votes in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Top 25 for five weeks, knocked off a Sun Devil squad that went on to advance to the 2009 NCAA Elite Eight. However, just days after defeating ASU, the Huskers took another hit inside with the loss of junior center Nikki Bober to a season-ending knee injury. Without two of their most experienced post players for a final non-conference game at five-time NCAA Final Four participant LSU, the Huskers closed non-conference play at 9-4 with all four setbacks coming to 2008 NCAA Tournament teams, including three on the road.\nAwards and honors.\nEight Nebraska women's basketball players claimed spots on the Big 12 Commissioner's Spring Academic Honor Roll. Nikki Bober, Kala Kuhlmann and Harleen Sidhu posted perfect 4.0 GPAs. Bober, Kuhlmann and Sidhu were joined on the spring honor roll by teammates Kaitlyn Burke, Kelsey Griffin, Cory Montgomery, Nicole Neals and Jessica Periago.\nTeam players drafted into the WNBA.\nNo one from the Huskers was selected in the 2009 WNBA draft."

The EuroCup is the European-wide league level that is one tier below the EuroLeague level. It began with qualifying round matches on October 20, 2009, and ended with the Eurocup Finals on April 17 and 18, 2010, at Fernando Buesa Arena in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country, Spain. The competition was won by Spanish club Power Electronics Valencia, who won their second EuroCup title, and also secured a place in the 2010–11 edition of the EuroCup's parent competition, the EuroLeague.\nFor the first time, the EuroCup conducted a four-team final round, as in the EuroLeague. To accommodate this change, a quarterfinal round was introduced. As in the EuroLeague, where the top two teams from each of the four groups in its Top 16 phase advanced to the quarterfinals, the top two teams from each group in the analogous Last 16 phase advanced to the quarterfinals. However, the structure of the EuroCup quarterfinals was very different from that of the EuroLeague — instead of a best-of-5 series, as in the EuroLeague, each EuroCup quarterfinal was a two-legged tie, with the winner determined on aggregate score. Unlike virtually all other basketball competitions, the quarterfinals did not use overtime, unless necessary to break an aggregate tie.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were two-legged ties determined on aggregate score. The first leg of the Bilbao–Nymburk tie was played on March 23, with all other first legs played on March 24. All return legs were played on March 31. The group winner in each tie, listed as \"Team #1\", hosted the second leg.\nFinal four.\nThe first-ever \"final four\" in the history of the competition, officially called the Eurocup Finals, was held at Fernando Buesa Arena in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.

He played the position of goaltender for the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC) (affiliated with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association) and was a member of the first Stanley Cup-winning team in 1893.\nPlaying career.\nPaton was a pioneer goaltender in organized hockey. His hockey career can be traced back to the early Montreal Carnivals prior to the formation of the AHAC in 1885. He was a founding member of the Montreal Hockey Club. His career would be marked by dominance. Throughout every season he played between 1888 and 1893 for the Montreal HC, his team would win the AHAC championship.\nThe authors of the reference book \"Ultimate Hockey\" consider Paton's performance in 1890, 1891 and 1893 to be worthy of winning the equivalent to the Vezina trophy that the NHL awards today for top goal tender. He was regarded in many history texts as being undefeated in 1890 and 1891.\nIn the 1892 AHAC season, Paton and the Montreal HC lost the championship to the Ottawa Hockey Club in the first game of the season. But in the final challenge of the season Paton and the Montreal HC defeated Ottawa 1–0 to regain the championship. In the 1893 AHAC season, the Montreal HC would win the season series and become the first winners of the Stanley Cup. Paton would retire from play after the season, making him also the first goalie to retire from Stanley Cup hockey competition as a current champion.\nPaton's 1885 Montreal Carnival championship medal sold for over in a 2009 auction.\nInternational.\nNotes:"

He played representative level rugby union for Wales, and at club level for Crumlin and Cross Keys as a flanker, and representative level rugby league for Great Britain and Wales, and at club level for Salford (captain), as a , or .\nBackground.\nBilly Williams was born in Crumlin, Monmouthshire, and he died aged 67 in Manchester, Lancashire, England.\nRugby career.\nRugby union.\nWilliams first came to note as a rugby player when he represented rugby union team Cross Keys. By the time he was selected for international duty, he was playing for unfashionable lower league team Crumlin. The fact that Williams was, and still is, the only player to be selected for international duty directly from the club is an indicator to the talent he showed as a flanker. Williams played in four union internationals, all of them part of the 1927 Five Nations Championship. His first encounter was against England, played away at Twickenham. The game ended with a 9-11 loss, and despite the result Williams was re-selected for the next three games. Wales ended the Championship with just one win, a home match against France. It is unknown if Williams would have been selected the next season as in 1927 he switched to professional league club Salford. By switching to a professional club, Williams was not only banned from playing union again for life, but also had his union international cap withheld.\nIn 1975, his Wales rugby union cap was awarded to him posthumously under an 'amnesty'.\nRugby league.\nWilliams played his first league game for Salford on 15 October 1927, and won three Championship and one Challenge Cup winners medals with the club over his career. On 15 January 1930, Williams was selected for the Great Britain team, to face a touring Australia side. Just three days later he won his first Wales league cap, in a match against the same touring Australians at Wembley. He won two more caps for Wales, a 1932 encounter with England and a 1933 match against Australia. In-between his Welsh caps, Williams also toured Australia with Great Britain in 1932. He played in 15 games of the tour and one Test against Australia.\nBilly Williams was one of the players who successfully toured in France with Salford in 1934, during which the Salford team earned the name \"Les Diables Rouges\", the seventeen players were; Joe Bradbury, Bob Brown, Aubrey Casewell, Paddy Dalton, Bert Day, Cliff Evans, Jack Feetham, George Harris, Barney Hudson, Emlyn Jenkins, Alf Middleton, Sammy Miller, Harold Osbaldestin, Les Pearson, Gus Risman, Billy Watkins, and Billy Williams.\nBilly Watkins played at in Salford's 7-4 victory over Barrow in the 1938 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London, in front of a crowd of 51,243.\nAbout Billy Williams' time, there was Salford's 2-15 defeat by Warrington in the 1929 Lancashire Cup Final at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 23 November 1929, the 10-8 victory over Swinton in the 1931 Lancashire Cup Final at The Cliff, Broughton, Salford on Saturday 21 November 1931, the 21-12 victory over Wigan in the 1934 Lancashire Cup Final at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 20 October 1934, the 15-7 victory over Wigan in the 1935 Lancashire Cup Final at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 19 October 1935, the 5-2 victory over Wigan in the 1936 Lancashire Cup Final at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 17 October 1936."

She is considered one of the female pioneers in the sport, having helped bring women's basketball international attention.\nBasketball career.\nGamble was born and raised in Grand Cane, Louisiana, and gained attention for her athletic abilities during high school. She would later, in 1980, be inducted into the Louisiana High School Athletics Hall of Fame. That same year Joe Ferguson was also inducted. She attended college at Ouachita Baptist University, where she played both basketball and tennis, and was named the National College Rookie of the Year in basketball for the 1968-'69 season. Under Head Coach Carolyn Moffit, Gamble led Ouachita Baptist to 48 regular season victories in three seasons, and a fourth place national finish during her freshman season, and third place national finish in 1970. In 2007 she was inducted into the Ouachita Baptist University Athletic Hall of Fame, joining other graduates from that university, to include former Dallas Cowboys star Cliff Harris.\nUSA Basketball.\nGamble went on to play for the USA Pan American team of 1971, in Cali, Colombia, where they finished second to Brazil, winning a silver medal. Although both the Brazil and USA teams finished with a 5–1 record, following Brazil being upset by Canada, Brazil was awarded the gold medal because they had defeated the USA team in the first game of the series. Gamble led the USA team during the games, averaging 20 points per game. They would go on to compete in the 1971 Women's World Championship, held in Brazil, where they finished a disappointing eighth.

The other individual classifications in the Tour de France are the points classification, also known as the sprinters' classification (green jersey), the mountains classification (polka dot jersey), and the young rider classification (white jersey).\nThe first Tour de France was in 1903, but the first Dutch cyclists started only in 1936. Already in that first year, Theo Middelkamp won a stage, but it would take until 1951 before Wim van Est was the first Dutch cyclists to wear the yellow jersey.

        "text": "The Australian Baseball League (ABL) is a professional baseball league in Australia. The league is governed by the Australian Baseball Federation (ABF). It uses the same name as a now-defunct competition held during the 1990s, and though it shares some history of the original league with the Claxton Shield awarded to winners of both competitions, it is considered to be a separate competition.\nBecause the ABL's season takes place from November to February, the ABL is one of baseball's recognised winter leagues (although it is summer in Australia when the season takes place), where minor-league prospects in North America are often assigned as an English-speaking alternative to the primary Spanish-speaking Latin America-based winter leagues.\nOrganisation.\nThe ABL was originally jointly owned by Major League Baseball (75%) and the Australian Baseball Federation (25%) before the ABF became the sole owners prior to the 2016–17 season. Rather than following more traditional models of the franchises being owned privately by individuals or organisations, the league is the owner of each team. One of the rationales for this structure is to closely manage the financial situation, helping to ensure that all teams are equally viable. It is expected that this arrangement will continue for at least the first five seasons: the period of time covered by the financial commitment made by MLB and the ABF.\nAs a result of the central ownership of the teams, all players are paid by the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The pay scale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. The ABL has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final decision has been made with regard to this. One concern about high rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.\nHistory.\nBaseball was brought to Australia by American gold miners and played on the gold fields of Ballarat for fun on their rest days in the 1850s.\nCricketers Gaggin &amp; Goldsmith tried to play baseball at Yarra Park, Melbourne in 1867, but Australian rules football fans arriving for the adjacent football disrupted the games.\nThe first series of full competitive games of baseball by Australians were played by members of the Surry Baseball Club on Moore Park and by members of the NSW Cricket Association on the adjacent Sydney Cricket Ground in June/July 1878.\nIn 1881, American residents formed a Union Baseball Club and a year later with Australians, formed a Sydney Baseball Club with U.S. Consul Gilderoy Wells Griffin forming a NSW Baseball Association in 1885.\nFollowing the A.G. Spalding tour by the Chicago White Sox and All-America teams in 1888 &amp; 1889, Harry Simpson stayed in Australia, formed baseball clubs in Melbourne, Adelaide, Broken Hill, and eventually Sydney with competition games being played. Simpson also travelled to New Zealand to promote baseball. When he suddenly died in September 1891, after setting up the NSW Baseball League, it was a New Zealander, Tony Chuck, who took his place in Australia.\nOriginal league.\nThe original Australian Baseball League commenced in 1989. At the time, it replaced the Claxton Shield as the top baseball competition in the country, with eight teams from Adelaide, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Over the course of the league's life, teams were also based in Canberra and Newcastle, with the number of teams competing in any one season varying from six to nine. Only four teams contested each of the ten seasons, with the others folding due to financial problems, or due to a lack of a suitable venue for home games.\nThe financial difficulties were not restricted to the clubs, as the league was forced to close after the summer of 2000. Running at a loss of A$2 million a season, the rights to the league were sold to Dave Nilsson—an Australian Major League Baseball player with the Milwaukee Brewers at the time—for a reported A$5 million.\nFormation.\nOn 1 July 2009, a joint press-conference was held by the ABF, MLB and Australian Federal Government at the Palm Meadows Baseball Complex on the Gold Coast in Queensland, the site of the Major League Baseball Australian Academy Program (MLBAAP). During the conference the intention to resurrect a national baseball league for Australia was announced, with the Government announcing A$400,000 towards the new league. Though some sources reported that the new league could be running as early as October 2010, there had been no official timeframe released for the new league to commence.\nInitial reports suggested the competition would likely include between eight and ten teams from around Australia. Discussions were held between the ABF and Baseball New Zealand about the possibility of a team based in New Zealand being included in the competition. The offer, however, was declined on the basis that there was not sufficient infrastructure, specifically citing the need for a suitable stadium and a major sponsor for the team. The possibility of a New Zealand team joining the competition at some point in the future had not been ruled out though. Auckland Tuatara joined in 2018.\nThere were additional concerns about the viability of a team based in South Australia, primarily based on the lack of a suitable stadium with lights to be able to play night games. This, along with playing on baseball-specific grounds — as opposed to playing on temporarily converted rugby league grounds as had been the case in the old ABL — was seen as a necessary requirement to insure the long-term profitability of the competition.\nIn August 2009, a bid process was launched by the Australian Capital Territory Baseball Association (ACTBA) for a team to be based in Canberra with the name and motto of \"Let's Do It Canberra\". The bid was not in competition with any other bids, but was required to meet certain minimum standards, such as fan and sponsorship support, to be successful and join the other five teams from Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney that were at the time confirmed. On 18 November 2009, it was announced by the ABF that the Canberra bid was successful, confirming that the inaugural season would include six teams.\nIn December 2009, a competition was launched for fans to decide the names of the foundation franchises, called \"Name Your ABL Team\". For each franchise, four team-name options were available to choose from, in addition to being able to enter another name created by the entrant. In August 2010, the names of the teams were announced, along with team logos and colours: Adelaide Bite, Brisbane Bandits, Canberra Cavalry, Melbourne Aces, Perth Heat, and Sydney Blue Sox.\nSeason structure.\nRegular season.\nFor the inaugural season, the regular season was played from November through to January over ten weeks, similarly to the 2010 season of the Claxton Shield. With the expansion from five to six teams, each team played every week as opposed to the two bye weeks the teams had previously. In addition, rather than a three-game series each week, the series were four games each, resulting in each team playing 40 games over the season. As had been the case in 2010, the majority of games were played on Fridays and Saturdays, though some games were also played on Thursdays and Sundays, depending on the team hosting and whether or not a doubleheader was included in the series.\nThe 2011–12 season largely followed the same format as the 2010–11 season, with only minor changes. Though the opening game of the season was scheduled again be the only game played that day, the whole series was played over the same weekend along with the first series for each of the other four teams. To allow for the Perth Heat's participation in the Asia Series, each of the teams had a bye weekend during the first half of the season. The season expanded from 40 to 45 games per team; one of the two series played against each opponent expanded from 4 to 5 games.\nThe 2012–13 season also had minor modifications from the previous season. Each team's bye weekends were in the first three rounds of competition, and each series held during these weekends were only 3 games long, and were billed as \"... against their two closest geographical neighbours; building upon both traditional and newly established rivalries.\" The match-ups for these games echoed the divisions used in the 2008 Claxton Shield, where teams based in Brisbane, Canberra and Sydney were in the Eastern Division, and teams from Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth were in the Southern Division. The remaining 10 weeks were made up of 4-game series, like the 2010–11 season. By the end of the season, each team had played each other team at least eight times, with an additional three against both of their geographic rivals.\nAll-Star Game.\nIn the league's second season, it was announced that an All-Star Game would take place, to be held in Perth on 21 December 2011. Like the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, it would be held midway through the regular season, and would feature the best players in the league. Rather than the teams in the All-Star Game being made up of players from certain teams, the game would be contested by Team Australia and a team of World All-Stars, selected from the import or international players participating in the ABL at the time.\nPostseason.\nFor the first two ABL seasons, the postseason involved the top four teams in a three-round structure following the Page playoff system. In the inaugural season, each round consisted of a best–of–three-game series between the respective teams, however this was changed in 2011–12 such that the first two rounds were decided in a best–of–five series, with the championship series remaining best–of–three. The first- and second-placed teams played each other in the major semi-final series, with the winner proceeding directly to the championship series and the loser to the preliminary final series. The winner of the minor semi-final series between the third- and fourth-placed teams also went to the preliminary final series, while the loser was eliminated. Likewise, the winner of the preliminary final series qualified for the championship series, the loser eliminated.\nThe third season used a shortened format from the two previous seasons. Only the top three teams qualified for a two-round postseason, with each round consisting of a best–of–three-game series. The first-placed team directly qualified for the championship series, and the second- and third-placed teams played each other in the preliminary final series, the winner of which qualified for the second place in the championship series.\nFor the 2017–18 season, the ABL announced that the top four teams at the end of the regular home and away season would qualify for the semifinals, providing more opportunities for teams to compete for Championship glory. Teams will be seeded from #1 to #4 based on their record and finishing order in the home and away season. The #1 Seed and #2 Seed will be awarded home semi-finals, and will host all three games in a best of three series. The ABLCS will be a home and away split series with the Highest Seeded Winner awarded the choice to host either Game 1, OR Games 2 and 3.\nThe winner of the championship series is named the ABL Champion for that season, and is awarded the Claxton Shield; the prize given to the top Australian baseball team since 1934.\nIn the 2018–19 season, a Wild Card game was added as part of the league's expansion to 8 teams with the winner advancing to the divisional semi-finals, and Canberra won the inaugural game against the Melbourne Aces.\nAsia Series.\nAfter the inaugural ABL season had been completed, it was announced that the league's champions each season would be invited to the restarted Asia Series. The event had previously been contested between the winners of Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) Japan Series, Korea Professional Baseball's (KPB) Korean Series, Chinese Professional Baseball League's (CPBL) Taiwan Series, and China Baseball League's (CBL) championship series. The 2011 tournament did not feature the CBL's champions, but officials stated that a team would participate in future editions. Unlike all four previous editions of the tournament which were held in Japan, the 2011 edition was held in Taiwan. The tournament follows a round-robin format, where each team plays each other once. The top two teams then face each other in a single game to decide the champion.\nThe Asia Series is held in November, which would otherwise create a conflict for the ABL champion team as the following season would have already commenced. To avoid this, the League announced that during the 2011–12 season, the Perth Heat—2010–11 champions—would be scheduled to have a bye while competing in Taiwan.\nRoster formation.\nIn any regular four-game series (or fewer), the players eligible to play, or 'Active List', is limited to 22 players. Three ineligible 'Reserve List' players are named on each roster that may replace an active player mid-series due to injury or a reserve player completing a suspension. In addition to the Active List, four 'Development List' players may be named to play during the series. These development list players must be 23 years of age or younger, have Australian citizenship or residency and not yet accumulated 130 at-bats or 50 innings pitched. Such development players are not eligible to appear in extra innings games.\nThe majority of the rosters in the league are made up of local and international players who play their northern hemisphere summer in North America's Major League Baseball, Minor League Baseball, the South Korean KBO, the Japanese NPB, the Taiwanese CPBL, European baseball, or one of the various independent baseball leagues. In addition, many local amateurs who are formerly professional or play in the regional amateur club teams make up the balance of these rosters.\nSince the inaugural season, there have been limitations on the number of internationals or 'imports' either on an active roster or any given game. As of 2018, a cumulative points system is in place to limit the number of foreign born players over the course of a season. 150 points may be used cumulatively over the season's ten series.\nFor the 2020–2021 season only, this was changed to 360 points used on a per game basis across 24 regular season games. Non-affiliated overseas players were also changed from 4 points to 2.\nTeams may nominate two Marquee Players who were either:\nIn addition to Australian players, New Zealand citizens and residents are considered native players for Auckland and South Korean players for Geelong.\nMedia coverage.\nAs of the 2019–20 season, the live coverage is provided by:\nFor the inaugural season, there had been no television coverage of regular season games, either live, delayed or in a regular highlights package review format, despite having been in negotiations with Fox Sports and Network Ten. After completing negotiations for live television coverage of the finals, the championship series was broadcast live on Fox Sports.\nOn 1 November 2010, Sydney community radio station Triple H FM announced it would provide live broadcasts of Sydney Blue Sox home matches as well as Canberra Cavalry's home series against the Blue Sox, Melbourne Aces and Perth Heat—the weeks Sydney was away from home. Perth Now's radio station SportFM announced it would cover the Perth Heat spring training games as well as the opening game of every Heat home series.\nThe Adelaide Bite, Brisbane Bandits and Perth Heat provided free audio and video streaming through internet website Ustream.\nFor the second season, Fox Sports expanded its television coverage of the ABL to include the All-Star Game in addition to the championship series. The game was also carried live via ESPN Star Sports in China, India and Taiwan. It was shown on delay in the United States on the MLB Network, as well as also being shown on delay in Japan and South Korea. The international television coverage of the championship series expanded from that of the All-Star Game, with Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines also getting live coverage through ESPN Star Sports, with several additional countries in Asia and Oceania including New Zealand getting delayed television coverage. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) introduced live radio coverage of the championship series via the digital ABC Radio Grandstand station. In recent years, ABL coverage of its All-Star Game and championship series has expanded to Canada through SportsNet Ontario (effectively simulcasting MLB Network in the United States).\nFor the 2015—16 season, one Sunday match for each of the last five regular season rounds was shown live nationally on ESPN. This marked the first time in the franchise's history that regular season matches had been shown on television. In addition, all five were also aired live in Asia via Fox Sports Asia, while three of the matches were shown live in the U.S. on the MLB Network.\nESPN has broadcast live the 2013–14, 2014–15, and 2015–16 Championship series'. In addition, the 2014–15 and 2015–16 series' were broadcast in the United States on MLB Network and online on MLB.com, and in Asia on Fox Sports Asia.\nAccording to Ministry of Sport, the 2018/19 ABL season became the most viewed since its inception.\nCurrent clubs.\nThough the locations for the six teams had been known for some time previously, it was not until 5 August 2010 that the names of the teams were announced. Websites were also launched on the same day for each of the teams with the exception of the Perth Heat, which had been the name of the Western Australian team playing in the Claxton Shield since 2006, as well as being one of the franchises from the original ABL, contesting all ten seasons. The Brisbane Bandits is also a reintroduction of a team name from the original ABL that participated in all but the final season.\nPrior to being renamed the Giants, the Adelaide Bite used a name that the South Australia state baseball team has previously used at various times in the Claxton Shield, which in turn refers both to the great white shark common to South Australian waters as well as the geographic feature, the Great Australian Bight. Likewise, the Melbourne Aces uses the Victoria state baseball team's moniker from Claxton Shield competitions past. The Canberra Cavalry and the Sydney Blue Sox both use names not previously used in Australian baseball at the national level.\nPrior to the 2016–17 ABL season, the Adelaide Bite's home ground, Norwood Oval (known as \"Coopers Stadium\" due to sponsorship) was the only ABL venue not built specifically for baseball use. Norwood Oval is the long time home of Australian rules football team the Norwood Redlegs who play in Adelaide major local competition the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). The oval however, due to having lights installed, has generally been the main venue for baseball in Adelaide since 1951. Although the oval has a normal spectator capacity of 22,000 for football, due to the configuration of the baseball diamond spectators are not permitted beyond the outfield fence and capacity is generally restricted to around 10–15,000 for ABL games still making it easily the largest capacity venue in the league. For the 2016–17 season the Adelaide Bite moved from Norwood Oval to the purpose-built Diamond Sports Stadium.\nAuckland Tuatara and Geelong-Korea both folded following the 2022–23 Australian Baseball League season.\nPotential expansion.\nIn November 2017, the league officially announced plans to add two more teams for the 2018–19 season. The expanded eight team league will continue to work with partners around the region. On 6 April 2018, it was announced that a New Zealand team based in Auckland would be joining the league for the 2018–19 season. On 18 May 2018, it was announced that an all-Korean team based in Geelong would be joining the league for the 2018–19 season.\nAfter the expansion of the league into Auckland and Geelong in the 2018–19 season the league immediately benefited from an exponential increase in viewership numbers and has looked to expand to ten teams as early as the 2020–21 season. An additional two teams would be similar to the Geelong-Korea concept; a foreign sponsored roster based in an Australian city. These teams would have Japanese, Taiwanese or even Chinese comprised rosters.\nThe league has publicly stated the most likely expansion to ten teams would be based in regional Australia, being either Tasmania, Wollongong, Alice Springs or a second team in either far south or north Queensland.\nA second team in New Zealand, Lismore, Newcastle and the Gold Coast have also been mentioned as other potential expansion cities.\nWomen's Australian Baseball League.\nIn October 2018, it was announced by Baseball Australia that it was working towards a women's ABL and began a process of crowd funding to help kick start the league with the support of sponsors and partners. In September 2019, it was announced that the league with a name to confirmed would begin in the 2021 financial year, most likely following the conclusion of the 2020–21 Australian Baseball League season.\nFour teams were confirmed to be a part of the first season with licenses were granted to the Adelaide Giants, Brisbane Bandits, Canberra Cavalry and Baseball Victoria. Auckland, Geelong, Perth and Sydney opted against submitting a team in the inaugural competition, but expressed interest in joining after the first season. The Melbourne Aces were not part of the licensing process due to a then ongoing change of management.\nExhibition games and testing are set to take place during the 2020 Women's Nationals and beyond."

        "text": "The Indonesia men's national basketball team represents the Republic of Indonesia in international basketball competitions. The governing body of the team is the \"Persatuan Bola Basket Seluruh Indonesia\" (Indonesian Basketball Association – \"PERBASI\").\nIts biggest success was the gold medal at the 1996 South East Asian Championship. Team Indonesia is one of the major teams in Southeast Asia. The team finished among the top-four teams in Asia at the 1967 Asian Basketball Championship. At the 1996 SEABA Championship, Indonesia was the dominant country and won the gold medal.\nAt the 1997 SEA Games in Jakarta, Indonesia failed to get a medal. Then, two years later Indonesia won the bronze medal at the Brunei 1999 SEA Games.\nIndonesia participated at the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship as well, which was held 6–16 August 2009, in Tianjin, China. They were able to qualify for the said tournament by placing second in the 2009 SEABA Championship held from 6–9 June 2009.\nAt the FIBA Asia Championship, only the top 3 qualified for the World Basketball Championships. For these events, the head coach of the team was Rastafari Horongbala.&lt;br&gt;\nAt the FIBA Asia Championship 2009, Indonesia finished 15th, leaving behind Sri Lanka.\nOn individual performances, Kelly Purwanto and Isman Thoyib finished among the tournament's top performers. Purwanto finished in the top ten in steals per game, Thoyib finished in the top ten in blocks per game.\nIndonesian basketball-icon Mario Wuysang was not able to represent his country at that event due scheduling conflicts (the final four of the Indonesian IBL was scheduled about the same time as this Asian Championship). \nIndonesia co-hosted the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup along with Philippines and Japan although its national team did not finish at least among the top eight in the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup and failed to qualify.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s, even though it had not officially become an independent country, several cities in Indonesia already had local basketball clubs. After the proclamation of independence on 17 August 1945, basketball games began to be widely known in the cities that were involved in rivalries as Yogyakarta vs. Solo. The game of basketball was played for the first time at the national level in 1948 in Solo at the National Sports Week I (PON I). Although this organization does not yet have a national sports master, it can get a quite lively welcome, both in terms of viewers and from the participants themselves.\nThree years after that, on 23 October 1951, the Indonesian Basketball Association was formed and named Persatuan Basketball Seluruh Indonesia. In 1955, due to the improvement of the name in accordance with Indonesian rules, the federation was renamed Persatuan Bola Basket Seluruh Indonesia (PERBASI). Perbasi was later accepted as a member of FIBA in 1953, and a year later, for the first time Indonesia sent a team to compete in the 1954 Asian Games in Manila.\nKit.\n2015–2021: Hype Clothes\n2021–2023: Nuraga\n2023-present: One Stop Apparel\nSponsor.\n2016: Hi-Test\n2021–2022: Sinar Mas Group\n2022-present: Bank Mandiri\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nCompetition: 2025 FIBA Asia Cup qualification&lt;br&gt;\nOpposition: Thailand (February 22, 2024)"

        "text": "Joseph Dominic Vitale (born August 20, 1985) is an American former professional ice hockey player and the current radio color analyst for the St. Louis Blues. Vitale was drafted 195th overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins, with whom he made his NHL debut. He also played with the Arizona Coyotes.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nAs a youth, Vitale played in the 1999 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the St. Louis Blues minor ice hockey team.\nVitale graduated from Christian Brothers College High School in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was part of three state championships and two undefeated seasons. He also played for the St. Louis Jr. Blues of the Central States Hockey League for two seasons, including a national championship in 2003–04. In 2004–05, he played for the Sioux Falls Stampede of the United States Hockey League.\nOn July 30, 2005, Vitale was drafted by the Penguins with the 195th selection in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. He enrolled in Northeastern University and began his college career as a freshman for the Huskies in 2005–06. He was named Hockey East Rookie of the Week in February and received Northeastern's Ed Arrington Memorial Rookie of the Year Award. In 2006–07, he was named alternate captain of the squad as a sophomore and was named to Hockey East's All-Academic Team. As a junior in 2007–08, he was named All-New England and New England's Most Improved Player, was named to the All-Hockey East Second Team, and was Northeastern's Most Valuable Player. Vitale's college career concluded when Northeastern lost to Cornell in the first round of the NCAA tournament, Northeastern's first trip to the NCAA tournament in 15 years. He finished his career at Northeastern with 34 goals and 60 assists for 94 points and 268 penalty minutes in 143 games.\nProfessional.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nOn April 3, 2009, Vitale signed a one-year, entry level NHL contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the 2009–10 season. He also signed an Amateur Try-Out contract with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. He recorded his first professional goal and assist on April 4, 2009 against the Albany River Rats. He finished the season with 4 points in 5 regular season games. Vitale also played in all 12 of the Penguins playoff games. During the 2009–10 season, Vitale played in 74 games in the AHL, scoring six goals and recording 26 assists for a total of 32 points. In January 2010, the Penguins and Vitale agreed to a two-year contract extension through the 2011–12 season.\nVitale made his NHL debut with the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 10, 2011 against the Los Angeles Kings. On February 16, 2011, Vitale scored his first NHL goal against Peter Budaj of the Colorado Avalanche.\nOn February 3, 2012, Vitale was re-signed by the Pittsburgh Penguins to a two-year contract extension worth $1.1 million.\nArizona Coyotes.\nAs a free agent, Vitale joined his second NHL team, signing a three-year contract with the Arizona Coyotes on July 1, 2014. In his second year with the Coyotes, Vitale began the 2015–16 NHL season. On October 17, 2015, Vitale was injured in his first game of the year against Boston Bruins. In a fight against Kevan Miller, Vitale suffered a fractured orbital bone and was expected to miss 4–6 weeks. Suffering lingering concussion issues as a result of the fight, Vitale was unable to make progress and on February 11, 2016, he was ruled out for the remainder of the 2015–16 season.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nOn June 24, 2016, the Coyotes traded Vitale, the 20th overall pick, and the 53rd overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for Pavel Datsyuk's $7.5 million cap hit and the 16th overall pick. Due to a concussion that sidelined Vitale for all but one game of the previous season, he sat out the entirety of the 2016–17 season and, with his contract expiring that year, he never played a game for the Red Wings. Vitale retired in July 2017 due to his career-ending concussion.\nPost-playing career.\nOn August 15, 2018, St. Louis native Vitale was named as the new radio color analyst of the St. Louis Blues on KMOX, the team's flagship station."

        "text": "The World Series Cricket tour of the West Indies took place between February and April 1979. It was the second tour event of World Series Cricket after the World XI New Zealand tour earlier in the season. It was the first tour to feature the WSC West Indies and WSC Supertests. The five match Supertest series was drawn 1–1. It ran in parallel with the ODI series which the West Indies won easily, 8–2.\nSquads.\n\"Note: Number of Supertests and One-Day matches in brackets\"\nItinerary.\nCompared to previous international tours to the West Indies the schedule of the WSC tour was rigorous. The previous year the official Australia side had conducted a tour of the West Indies that took in five Test matches, two ODIs and six tour matches in 75 days from 17 February to 3 May 1978. The WSC tour featured five Supertests and twelve ODIs in just 52 days from 20 February to 13 April. What made the tour so physically demanding were the back to back ODIs and constant travelling between Islands with only a day between fixtures. On top of the gruelling itinerary, the cricket was intense and of the highest standard, unlike traditional tours that feature matches against weak opposition.\nSupertests.\n1st Supertest.\n\"The Australian\" newspaper reported that never before had an Australian XI led by Ian Chappell been so humiliated in defeat. Australia had started well reducing the West Indies to 119–7. But Clive Lloyd as he had done so often before, resisted scoring a vital 56, aputting on 40 runs for the last wicket with the capable Wayne Daniel (17*). Chappell was delighted with his bowlers performance on a first day that closed with Australia 33/2, Ian out along with Bruce Laird and brother Trevor retired hurt. Twelve wickets would fall on the second day, Australia were bowled out for just 106, the four pronged West Indian attack making mince-meat of the Aussie batting card. With a lead of 76 the West Indies batted positively, compiling a total of 481 at a remarkable run rate of 4.39 runs per over. Clive Lloyd was again the star scoring a brilliant 197 before being the eighth batsman dismissed. Requiring an unlikely 558 runs to win in their second innings, the aggressive Ian Chappell chose to open the batting, protecting Trevor from the new ball. Ian made 41 but his side were only 83–4 at his dismissal and on the verge of a crushing defeat. Ray Bright made a good 47 not out, but the Australian tail were blown away by the four quicks, complemented by the medium pace of Richard Austin. The West Indies completed a 369 run win on the fourth day.\n2nd Supertest.\nPlay was suspended midway through Day 5 after the crowd threw bottles onto the ground. This was to protest against the umpire's decision to dismiss Roy Fredericks by leg before wicket. The match was abandoned at 2:30 pm and ended in a draw.\n4th Supertest.\nA result was never likely in the 4th Supertest at Bourda. When the Australians landed at Guyana they discovered it had been raining for days. On the scheduled first day play was abandoned before the players had even left for the ground. That evening the pitch was still underwater. On the second day the rain had stopped and it was hot and sunny. Yet the two captains, Chappell and Lloyd, decided the condition of the outfield was unfit for play, Greg Chappell describing it as a \"quagmire\". Unfortunately for the cricketers and officials at Bourda, thousands of spectators had been allowed into the ground that morning. Ian Chappell recalls how he was visited in the dressing rooms by the local chief of police and told, \"If there is no play today, I am afraid to tell you that I can no longer guarantee your safety at the ground.\" The consensus was that there must, therefore, be some sort of play. The captains and umpires agreed to start play at 4 pm and play for roughly an hour until the light faded. However a misinformed PA announced to the crowd that play would begin at 3 pm. This enraged the volatile Chappell, who then reneged on the deal and refused to play. The crowd, many of whom had been drinking rum and partying all day, sensed no play and began a riot. Both teams and the officials were locked in their dressing rooms. The Australians donned their new batting helmets and took guard with their bats, behind the bolted door. The rioters attacked the pavilion causing major damage and a couple of unnamed West Indian cricketers suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Chappell recalls a conversation after the event with West Indian wicketkeeper Deryck Murray. Murray insisted that the riot was a result of growing unhappiness at the Guyanese president Arthur Chung and that they used the abandoned cricket as an excuse. He believed that the rioters would never have intentionally harmed any of the cricketers. The words reassured some of the Australians, but many wanted to leave Guyana immediately and head to the next island, while some (about eight, which is half the squad) were considering returning to Australia. Chappell demanded his players stay and play, making a statement to the West Indian fans that they are not intimidated and will play to win. Play proceeded on the third morning as if nothing had happened. The ground was cleared of broken glass and the game played out to a draw with a century from Greg Chappell confirming his status as the outstanding batsman of the series."

He played for the New York Giants and the New York Jets. He later worked as a radio color commentator for Jets and Giants games until 2007. He died of complications with Parkinson's disease in 2013.\nLife and career.\nJennings played both college football and college basketball and graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1974. As a high school student, he did not play football. He lettered in both football and basketball at St. Lawrence, and was inducted to the St. Lawrence Saints hall of fame in 1988.\nAfter graduating from St. Lawrence, Jennings was not drafted, and briefly signed with the Houston Oilers as a practice squad member until he was released and recruited to the New York Giants as a free agent. He played for the Giants from 1974 to 1984, and then moved to play for the New York Jets from 1984 to 1987. During his professional career, he went to the 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1982 Pro Bowl games. He also led the league for total punts in the 1979 season, and in punting yards in both the 1979 and 1980 seasons. He retired after the 1987 season.\nAfter his career playing professional football, Jennings began work as a radio color commentator. He commented on Jets games from 1988 to 2001 for New York sports radio station WFAN. He then moved to commenting on Giants games from 2002 until 2007, when he was replaced by former Giants linebacker Carl Banks. During this time, Jennings worked as a game analyst alongside fellow WFAN Giants announcers Bob Papa and Dick Lynch. In addition to his booth work, Jennings was a part of the Giants pre- and post-game shows, covering player interviews from the locker room. \nDave Jennings was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1995, and publicly revealed his condition in 2005. It was speculated around when he retired from broadcasting in 2008 that fatigue due to Parkinson's may have been the cause of his change in broadcasting roles and eventual retirement. He was inducted into the Giants' Ring of Honor in 2011 as one of the best punters in the franchise's history. Jennings died due to complications with Parkinson's on June 19, 2013, eleven days after his 61st birthday."

        "title": "Double-A (baseball)",
        "text": "Double-A (officially Class AA) is the second-highest level of play in Minor League Baseball in the United States since 1946, below only Triple-A. There are currently 30 teams classified at the Double-A level, one for each team in Major League Baseball, organized into three leagues: the Eastern League, the Southern League, and the Texas League.\nHistory.\nClass AA (\"Double-A\") was established in 1912, as the new highest classification of Minor League Baseball. Previously, Class A had been the highest level, predating the establishment of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues—the formal name of Minor League Baseball—in 1901. Entering the 1912 season, three leagues were designated as Class AA:\nEach of these leagues had previously been in Class A. Each remained in Class AA through 1945, then moved into Class AAA (\"Triple-A\") when it was established in 1946. No other leagues were designated Class AA during 1912–1945, although a Class A1 level (between Class A and Class AA) was established in 1936.\nThe contemporary Double-A classification, as the second-highest level in Minor League Baseball, was established in 1946. Entering that season, the three aforementioned leagues in Class AA all moved to the newly established Triple-A, and Class A1 became Double-A with two leagues:\nThe Texas League remained in Double-A for the next 75 years. During this time, there were limited changes to leagues at the Double-A level:\nEntering the 2020 minor league season (which was not played, due to the COVID-19 pandemic) the Texas League had been in Double-A since 1946, the Eastern League since 1963, and the Southern League since 1964. Prior to the 2021 season, Major League Baseball (MLB) reorganized the minor leagues. At that time, the existing leagues were temporarily renamed: Eastern League as Double-A Northeast, Southern League as Double-A South, and Texas League as Double-A Central. Following MLB's acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, MLB announced on March 16, 2022, that the leagues would revert to their prior names, effective with the 2022 season.\nSystem.\nThe Double-A classification usually hosts developing players that have been part of professional baseball for only a couple of years. These players can get to the Double-A level by earning a promotion from any of the lower-level leagues, with Class A-Advanced (\"High-A\") being immediately below Double-A in the minor league hierarchy.\nThe step up to the Double-A level can be one of the hardest promotions for such players because it is the level at which pitchers need to have a good off-speed pitch in their repertoires. In addition, it is the level where fastball-only hitters need to learn how to hit off-speed pitches, or their hopes of advancing to the majors will diminish. Some players may be placed in Double-A to begin their minor league careers, usually veterans from foreign leagues or top prospects out of college. Additionally, major league clubs sometimes send players to their Double-A team to rehabilitate from injuries.\nWhile Triple-A is the highest level in the minor leagues, players may also advance to the major leagues directly from Double-A. For example, within the Toronto Blue Jays organization, 17 position players were promoted from Double-A directly to MLB during 1978–2018; approximately one player every two seasons. As players at the Double-A level are, generally, still improving their skills, it could be argued that the pure talent level is higher in Double-A than Triple-A, where there may be some stagnation of talent.\nBecause players are not often moved back and forth from their major league parent club as often happens in Triple-A, the rosters of Double-A teams tend to be more stable. Fans of Double-A teams thus have a longer amount of time to get acquainted with the players, which helps create a better relationship between the team and its fans.\nPlayoffs.\nPrior to the 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, all three active Double-A leagues played split seasons, with the Eastern League moving to that system in 2019. Teams winning their division in either half of the season qualified for the postseason, with wild card teams filling out the remaining spots in a bracket tournament, usually composed of four teams.\nOn June 30, 2021, Minor League Baseball announced that the top two teams in each league (based on full-season winning percentage, and regardless of division) would meet in a best-of-five postseason series to determine league champions.\nAll-Star Games.\nPrior to the 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, each of the active Double-a leagues held its own midseason All-Star Game. From 1991 to 2002, the three combined to hold the Double-A All-Star Game between teams of American League-affiliated All-Stars and National League-affiliated All-Stars.\nAfter the start of the 2021 minor league season was delayed by a month, team schedules were released without a break for an all-star game.\nPace-of-play initiatives.\nAs a part of pace-of-play initiatives implemented in 2015, 20-second pitch clocks entered use at Double-A stadiums in 2015. In 2018, the time was shortened to 15 seconds when no runners are on base. Other significant changes implemented in 2018 included beginning extra innings with a runner on second base and limiting teams to eight mound visits during a nine-inning game. In 2019, the number of mound visits was reduced to seven, and pitchers were required to face a minimum of three consecutive batters, unless the side is retired or the pitcher is injured and unable to continue."

The winners of the AIAW tournaments from 1972 to 1981 are recognized as the national champions for those years.\nHistory.\nThe AIAW tournament was discontinued after the NCAA began sponsoring a women's collegiate basketball tournament in 1982. (In 1982, both the AIAW and NCAA sponsored competing tournaments.) The AIAW tournament was preceded by a tournament sponsored by the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW), which was held from 1969 to 1971.\nSixteen teams were invited to the tournament following qualifying rounds played on college campuses (except 24 teams were invited for the 1980 and 1981 tournaments). Ten of the sixteen teams were the winners of regional tournaments. The country had nine regions, but the Eastern regional was subdivided in a Region 1A and a Region 1B. The winners of those regional championships automatically proceeded to the National tournament, then a selection committee chose additional teams based upon considerations for individual team performance and geographical balance. Beginning in 1975, the AIAW divided its teams into divisions, and held separate tournaments for Division II and Division III teams.\nPre-NCAA statistics, based on AIAW Archives, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries.\nDivision I/Large College.\nTeam appearances.\nThe code in each cell represents the furthest the team made it in the respective tournament:"

        "text": "Robert Arthur “Nasty” Nash (December 16, 1892 – February 1, 1977) was an Irish-American professional American football player who played in the American Professional Football Association for the Akron Pros, Buffalo All-Americans, Rochester Jeffersons and the New York Giants. Prior to joining the AFPA, Nash played professionally in the \"Ohio League\" for the Massillon Tigers. He was considered by sports historians as one of the greatest offensive tackles of his era.\nNash was born in Ireland and raised in Bernardsville, New Jersey, where he played high school football at Bernards High School. Prior to playing professional football, Nash played college football at Cornell University and at Rutgers, where he received All-American honors in 1914. He was inducted into the Rutgers Hall of Fame in 1988.\nProfessional career.\nOn Sunday, October 10, 1920, Nash is credited with the first fumble recovery for a touchdown in a game featuring two league teams.\nOn Sunday, October 24, 1920, Nash picked up a blocked punt in the first quarter and ran eight yards for the only score of the day as the Pros defeated the Cleveland Tigers, 7–0.\nOn Sunday, October 31, 1920, according to Ike Roy Martin; on a punt return Jim Thorpe had instructed Martin to let Nash get by him. Thorpe had wanted to run into Nash, which he did. The collision resulted in them both being knocked out and they were carried off the field.\nNash was also a part of the first APFA player deal, in 1920, when Akron sold Nash to Buffalo for $300 and five percent of the gate receipts during a game between the two clubs. However, since Nash was a part of the Akron Pros during their championship season, he is credited as belonging on their championship team. Nash was also the very first captain of the New York Giants."

Starting from the 2015–16 KHL season, the Russian Championship is awarded to the highest-ranked Russian team of the playoffs. 2019–20 KHL season was prematurely ended due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe, and medals were awarded based on performance of clubs in the regular championships and in first round of the Gagarin Cup playoffs.\nUntil 2011–12 KHL season, non-Russian KHL teams were also eligible for Russian Championship.

        "text": "The Super Bowl of Poker (also known as Amarillo Slim's Super Bowl of Poker or SBOP) was the second most prestigious poker tournament in the world during the 1980s. While the World Series of Poker was already drawing larger crowds as more and more amateurs sought it out, the SBOP \"was an affair limited almost exclusively to pros and hard-core amateurs.\"\nPrior to 1979, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP. 1972 WSOP Main Event Champion and outspoken ambassador for poker, Amarillo Slim saw this as an opportunity. \"The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament,\" he said. Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979. Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event.\nOne of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure. The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool. The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure. In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third. This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.\n1983 Tournament.\nIn 1983, 5 Poker Hall of Famers made it to the cash in various tournaments at the SBOP. Jack Straus lost to two time World Series of Poker bracelet winner Hans Lund in the SBOP Main Event. Berry Johnston would finish third in one event while Bobby Baldwin would make it to two cashes. Billy Baxter, who would later gain fame for suing the IRS in Baxter v United States, also made it to the cash in one event. Sarge Ferris, a low-key but much respected professional player who was later inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame, won the No Limit 2-7 Lowball.\nThe 1983, tournament also witnessed Gabe Kaplan from Welcome Back, Kotter win his second SBOP tournament. When \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" went off the air in 1979, its lead character started a career in poker. During the early 1980s, Kaplan's success, particularly at the SBOP, led him to be considered among poker's elite. Kaplan made money in two events and won one."

His total at the Rugby World Cup finals was 1 try, 3 conversions and 5 penalties, for an aggregate of 24 points.\nIn addition to the full game, he played 7-a-side for Canada between 1983–1991 at the Hong Kong Sevens, Sydney Sevens, and Glasgow.\nWyatt left the National Team after the competition, aged only 30 years old.\nHe was inducted into the Oak Bay Highschool Sports Hall of Fame in 2000, Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame 2002, UVIC Sports Hall of Fame 2005, British Columbia Rugby Hall of Fame 2007, British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame 2017, British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame 2017 as and individual athlete and 2018 with the Rugby World Cup team of 1991, and the Canadian Rugby Hall of Fame 2019.

Ken was one of a rare breed of forwards with an ability to dominate games with sheer physical power and incredible ball-handling skills. At 6' 1\" and over sixteen stones Ken was a towering figure, quick runner and a damaging defender who always took the game to the opposition. He was an intimidating scrummager, inspiring pack leader and a player to be feared, respected and admired.\nBackground.\nKen Roberts was born in Atherton, Lancashire, England, and he died aged 79.\nPlaying career.\nInternational honours.\nKen Roberts won caps for Great Britain whilst at Halifax, in 1963, against Australia where his début helped secure a 16–5 victory. He was also capped in 1964 against France (2 matches), in 1965 against France, and New Zealand (3 matches), and in 1966 against France, and New Zealand (2 matches). In 1966, he also toured Australasia with Great Britain, playing in 19 matches including both Test matches against New Zealand, scoring 4 tries and captaining the touring side against Central Queensland, Newcastle, Southern New South Wales, Northern Division and Monaro. Ken was a committee member of the British Rugby League Lions Association\nCounty honours.\nKen Roberts won 5 caps for Lancashire throughout his career against Yorkshire, Cumberland and New Zealand.\nCombined Salford-Swinton – 1 appearance\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nKen Roberts played left- in Swinton's 9–15 defeat by St. Helens in the 1960 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1960–61 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 29 October 1960, played left- in the 9–25 defeat by St. Helens in the 1961 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1961–62 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 11 November 1961, and played left- in the 4–7 defeat by St. Helens in the 1962 Lancashire Cup Final during the 1962–63 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 27 October 1962.\nChampionship final appearances.\nKen Roberts played in Halifax's 15–7 victory over St. Helens in the 1964–65 Championship Final during the 1964–65 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 22 May 1965.\nClub career.\nKen Roberts made his début for Swinton on 10 March 1956, scoring a try and a goal from the second-row in a 25–7 victory at Blackpool Borough. He would go on to amass 128 points throughout his seven-year spell at the club. In 1960, 1961 and 1962 he played in three consecutive Lancashire Cup Finals for Swinton and was a member of their Lancashire League winning team during the 1960–61 season. Ken won the Championship with Swinton during the 1962–63 season, and on 23 April 1963, played his 202nd and last game for Swinton, a 17–4 victory over Oldham at Watersheddings, Oldham.\nIn 1963, Ken was transferred across the Pennines, for a huge £5,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £240,900 in 2014), to Halifax where, on 24 August, he made his début at Thrum Hall, Halifax against Featherstone Rovers. The same year, Halifax would win the Yorkshire Cup, beating Featherstone Rovers in the Final. 1964 saw Ken elected as vice-captain at Halifax, then soon after, captain. He was also a member of the team which beat Castleford 20–12 at Fartown to win the Eastern Division Championship that same year. Ken's leadership of a magnificent pack of forwards was a major factor in Halifax's charge towards the Rugby League Championship in 1965. It was their dominance which allowed Halifax to overcome St. Helens 15-7 and Ken had a momentous season himself, making 39 appearances. The following season saw Halifax lose to St Helens in a repeat Championship Final at Swinton, and saw Ken make another incredible 36 appearances, including the fixture against New Zealand. On 27 January 1967, Ken played his last game for Halifax, against Leeds at Headingley.\nThe following week he walked out at Odsal in the Challenge Cup for Bradford Northern against Featherstone Rovers.

Bangladesh Rugby Federation is Member of National Sports Council, Member of Bangladesh Olympic Association and Regional Association Asia Rugby.\nHistory.\nPre-independence Bengal.\nLike other sports founded in England and brought to the subcontinent during the British Raj, such as cricket, rugby union has a long history. Bangladeshi rugby's history may be discontinuous, but it dates back to the Bengal Presidency, when East Bengal (future Bangladesh) and West Bengal (now in India) were politically united. Rugby became particularly popular in Calcutta, the capital of Bengal at that time. The earliest trace of Rugby Football in the subcontinent dates back to a scratch match or two played in Calcutta and Madras during the visit of HMS \"Galatea\" in 1871. The teak goal posts used on the occasion of the Calcutta Match were afterward used by the C.F.C. up to at least 1886. The first recorded match was played on Christmas Day 1872, at CFC in Calcutta, it was played between England and a combined team of Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The game caught on and had to be repeated within the week. This is why the Calcutta Cup, the oldest trophy in international rugby bears the name it does.\nA number of Bengali noblemen sent their children to English private schools, and they also picked up the game there.\nHowever, because of the climate in the region, other sports such as cricket, polo, and tennis became more popular, and rugby went into decline in the region. And like other areas in Asia and Africa, the game became too connected with the British expatriate community, meaning that when Bangladesh became independent (as East Pakistan), the game more or less died. However, despite not being successful in Bangladesh, rugby union in Sri Lanka, which has an even hotter climate has been highly successful.\nPost-independence.\nRugby had little or no presence from the period of independence from Britain, and thence from Pakistan.\nHowever, in 2007, after a long period of dormancy, some Japanese coaches started a youth programme. Amongst the schools which sent under-12s to the training camp were the Sunbeams, the Sunnydale, Marie Curie School, The Agha Khan School, Playpan, Reading, Green James, Khilgaon Oxford School, Dhanmondi Boys' High School, Khilgaon Model School and East Khilgaon Primary School. The Bangladeshi Rugby Federation Union has been training these children in order to start an inter-schools tournament.\nIn 2018 Bangladesh won bowl group of 2018 Asia Rugby Sevens Series"

        "text": "Frederick Wood (21 January 1884 – 15 July 1924) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative half-back. He was vice-captain of the Wallabies on their first overseas tour in 1908–09 and later captained the side in Test matches in 1910 and 1914. His representative career lasted from 1905 to 1914.\nEarly club and representative career.\nWood played for the Glebe club in Sydney and first attracted attention when he represented in a 1905 Metropolitan (Sydney) side against the touring New Zealand side. He was then selected in the second match for New South Wales against those same All Blacks.\nA full Australian team was selected the next day – the first national side to tour overseas and Wood was selected at half-back in the 1905 side captained by Stan Wickham which toured New Zealand. Wood played in four tour matches of the seven contested by the side, but did not figure in the sole Test.\nIn 1907, Wood was selected for New South Wales to meet the visiting All Blacks and played two matches alongside Chris McKivat in the halves with the first a narrow loss and the second a 14–0 victory to the Waratahs. Both McKivat and Wood were selected in the Australian test side captained by Peter Burge to meet those same All Blacks but the Wallabies were well-beaten 6–26. Woods held his spot for the 2nd Test (a loss to Australia) and the 3rd (a 5-all draw).\nIn 1908 an Anglo-Welsh side toured Australia and Wood was honoured with the state captaincy for New South Wales in the first of the two encounters he played against them.\nWallaby tourist.\nWood was selected as vice-captain on the first Wallaby 1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, the squad captained by Herbert Moran. Wood and Joshua Stevenson were the selected halfbacks but with Stevenson injured in the fifth tour game the selectors were forced to look at other halves combinations amongst Chris McKivatt, Arthur McCabe and Ward Prentice who were also in the squad. Wood was unavailable with injury for a run of five games and McKivatt seized the opportunity with both hands and played in both Tests at half-back and captained the side in the Olympic gold medal bout against Cornwall.\nMoran later in \"Viewless Winds\" referred to the friction that arose since Wood as vice-captain was also a selector \"\"The vice-captain was great little player who never found his form in England. It used to be unpleasant for us when, in the face of this, he insisted for a long time on his own selection. We did not want unfriendliness, but for nine [sic, in truth seven] matches in succession he kept McKivat out of his proper position\"\nHowever it was no disgrace to be playing second fiddle to McKivat and in any case following his recovery from injury Wood played another thirteen games, seven of them as captain and finished with a total tour tally of twenty appearances. When the Wallabies returned to Australia McKivatt and thirteen others of the squad moved to the ranks of the new professional code of rugby league and Wood resumed his place as the top half-back for New South Wales.\nWood played against the touring All Blacks of 1910 twice for New South Wales and in all three Test matches. That second test marked Australia's first ever victory over New Zealand in the seven encounters till then. Wood played against the New Zealand Māori rugby union team when they toured against New South Wales in 1910 and in 1913. That same year the Wallabies undertook a nine match tour of New Zealand with Wood playing in eight of those games. Wood played in all three Tests and Howell quotes the Chester McMillan reference (\"The Visitors\") that in both the second and third Tests \"Wood was the outstanding back on the field\".\nIn 1914 aged 30 Wood was still representing for Australia when the All Blacks toured against and he was honoured with the captaincy of the national team in the first and third Tests. World War I marked the end of international rugby for a while as it also marked the end of Wood's long representative career having played 39 times for Australia including 12 Tests.\nFred Wood died aged 40 in 1924.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n "

        "text": "The Women's 10 kilometre classical cross-country skiing competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy was held on 16 February, at Pragelato.\nThe world champion at the 10 kilometre event was Kateřina Neumannová – however, that was in the freestyle event, and a classical-style 10 kilometre in the World Championship had not been held since 1989. In the World Cup, however, there had been two events leading up to the Olympics, both won by Norwegians: Marit Bjørgen won at Kuusamo, Finland in November, and Hilde Gjermundshaug Pedersen at Otepää, Estonia in January. Bente Skari won the Olympic gold in 2002, but did not defend her status, having retired after the 2003 World Championship.\nŠmigun won her second gold of the Olympics, winning 21 seconds ahead of Marit Bjørgen, with two other Norwegians following.\nIn 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that one of Šmigun's samples from the 2006 Turin Games had been retested with a positive result. On 24 October 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun's case will be heard in the Court of Arbitration for Sport by the end of the month. Marit Bjørgen of Norway, winner of the silver medal, would receive the gold medal if Šmigun is stripped of the gold.\nResults.\nSeventy-two skiers entered the race, with all but two completing the course and receiving a rank. Beckie Scott, the 2002 Olympic champion in the pursuit event, was disqualified for skiing outside the marked track, the only such disqualification in the cross-country events in Turin."

        "title": "Brandon Knight (basketball)",
        "text": "Brandon Emmanuel Knight (born December 2, 1991) is an American professional basketball player for AEK Athens of the Greek Basket League. A two-time Gatorade National Player of the Year, Knight played one season of college basketball for Kentucky before being selected by the Detroit Pistons in the 2011 NBA draft. After two seasons with the Pistons, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. He spent a season and a half in Milwaukee before being traded to the Phoenix Suns in February 2015. In August 2018, he was traded to the Houston Rockets. At the 2019 trade deadline, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns before being traded back to the Lakers at the 2020 trade deadline.\nHigh school career.\nBorn in Miami, Florida, Knight attended Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A student-athlete at Pine Crest, Knight held a 4.3 grade-point average. As a junior in 2008–09, he averaged 31.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 3.2 steals. As a senior in 2009–10, he averaged 32.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 4 assists. He was subsequently named Gatorade National Player of the Year both years, in addition to earning Gatorade High School Athlete of the Year in 2010. He led Pine Crest to four state title games, winning state championships in 2008 and 2009. He was also a four-time class 3A-1A Basketball Player of the Year (as named by the \"Miami Herald\") and a two-time Florida Mr. Basketball. His 3,515 career points ranks second on the Florida high school basketball scoring list.\nFollowing his senior season, Knight participated in the McDonald's All-American Game, Nike Hoop Summit and Jordan Brand Classic. In the 2010 McDonald's All-American Game, he hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the West a 107–104 win.\nRanked as the No. 6 overall prospect of 2010 by Rivals.com, Knight made a verbal commitment to the University of Kentucky in April 2010. Knight did not sign a binding national letter of intent with Kentucky. He kept his options open by signing a financial-aid agreement, which indicated his intention to play for Kentucky, but left him free to go elsewhere amid speculation about coach John Calipari going to the NBA.\nCollege career.\nKnight averaged 17.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.2 assists in 38 games as a freshman for the Kentucky Wildcats. He shot 42% from the field, 38% from three-point range and 80% from the free-throw line on the season. He set Kentucky freshman records in points scored (657), 3-pointers made (87) and most 20-point games in a season (14). He also led the team in SEC play with 17.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists in 16 games to earn First-Team All-SEC honors by the coaches, Second-Team All-SEC by the media and an SEC All-Freshman team selection. Knight scored a career-high 30 points against West Virginia in the third round of the 2011 NCAA tournament. He then recorded 22 points, seven rebounds and four assists against North Carolina in the Elite Eight and was named the NCAA East Region All-Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nIn April 2011, Knight declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Pistons (2011–2013).\nKnight was selected by the Detroit Pistons with the eighth overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft. In May 2012, he earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors, becoming the first Pistons' rookie since Grant Hill (1994–95) to be named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Knight's 847 points were the second-most by a Pistons' rookie since the 1985–86 season and his 12.8 points per game were the fourth-highest average by a Pistons' rookie since the 1980–81 season.\nKnight appeared in 141 games (135 starts) in two seasons with Detroit, averaging 13.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 3.9 assists while shooting 37.3 percent from beyond the arc. He scored in double figures 92 times with the Pistons, including three 30-point outings.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2013–2015).\nOn July 31, 2013, Knight was traded, along with Khris Middleton and Viacheslav Kravtsov, to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Brandon Jennings. Knight's first season with Milwaukee was hit early with a hamstring injury in the season opener on October 30, limiting him to two minutes that night and forcing him to miss eight of the next 10 games. On December 20, 2013, Knight scored 17 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, and recorded 8 assists in a 114–111 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On December 31, Knight scored a career-high 37 points in a 94–79 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. He enjoyed the most productive season in his three years as a pro, becoming only the second player in the franchise's 46-year history to lead the team in scoring (1,291 points) and assists (352) during his first season with the team.\nOn November 19, 2014, Knight infamously missed a wide-open fastbreak layup for the win in OT against the Brooklyn Nets. However, Knight was able to redeem himself by hitting a game-tying triple to force a 3rd OT. The Bucks were able to win the game 122–118. On January 15, 2015, Knight scored 20 points, grabbed 5 rebounds, recorded 6 assists, and recorded a career-high 6 steals in a blowout win versus the New York Knicks. The 2014–15 season saw Knight enter the All-Star break as the team's leader in scoring and assists. In 52 games at the All-Star break, he averaged 17.8 points, a career-high 5.4 assists, a career-high 4.3 rebounds, and a career-high 1.6 steals, while shooting career-highs of 43.5 percent from the field and 40.9 percent from three-point range.\nPhoenix Suns (2015–2018).\nOn February 19, 2015, Knight was traded, along with Kendall Marshall, to the Phoenix Suns in a three-team trade also involving the Philadelphia 76ers. He missed time in March with a left ankle injury, before missing the conclusion of the season with a left heel bone bruise that required surgery.\nOn July 17, 2015, Knight re-signed with the Suns to a five-year, $70 million contract. On November 12, he tied his career high with 37 points in a 118–104 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Four days later, Knight recorded his first career triple-double posting 30 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists in a 120–101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Knight became just the fourth player since steals became an official stat in the 1973–74 season to record a triple-double with a line of at least 30 points, 15 assists, 10 rebounds and four steals, joining Pete Maravich, Magic Johnson and Russell Westbrook, as well as the second player behind Magic Johnson to record such a line at 23 years old or younger. On November 20, Knight set a new career high with 38 points in a 114–107 victory over the Denver Nuggets. On December 13, he scored 25 points and hit a career-high seven 3-pointers in a 108–101 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Knight missed time between late January and early March with a left adductor strain. On March 12, he scored 30 points and hit a career high-tying seven 3-pointers in a 123–116 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On March 28, he again scored 30 points and tied a career high with seven 3-pointers in a 121–116 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, recording his fifth 30-point game of the season. On April 3, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with the same left adductor strain that kept him out for seven weeks earlier in the season. Five days later, he underwent successful surgery to treat the sports hernia.\nThe 2016–17 season saw Knight come off the bench during the first half of the season before being shut down despite being healthy over the second half of the season. He went on to miss the entire 2017–18 season after sustaining a torn ACL in his left knee in July 2017 that required surgery.\nHouston Rockets (2018–2019).\nOn August 31, 2018, Knight was traded, alongside Marquese Chriss, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Ryan Anderson and De'Anthony Melton. Despite looking to rehabilitate his career in 2018–19, Knight was ruled out indefinitely prior to the season after his surgery got infected during the offseason. On November 30, he was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA G League on a rehab assignment. He played for the Vipers that night, recording 16 points and five assists in 22 minutes against the Salt Lake City Stars, before being recalled by the Rockets on December 1. On December 13, he made his debut for the Rockets, recording one assist and one rebound in four minutes in a 126–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, marking his first game since February 15, 2017. He played 12 games for the Rockets, with his final appearance coming on January 11 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was sidelined in January due to left knee soreness.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2019–2020).\nOn February 7, 2019, Knight was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade involving the Rockets and the Sacramento Kings. He made his debut for the Cavaliers two days later, scoring nine points in just under 12 minutes off the bench in a 105–90 loss to the Indiana Pacers.\nReturn to Detroit (2020).\nOn February 6, 2020, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Knight and John Henson, along with a 2023 second round draft pick, to the Detroit Pistons for Andre Drummond.\nDallas Mavericks / Sioux Falls Skyforce (2021–2022).\nIn March 2021, Knight worked out with the Milwaukee Bucks, his former team from the peak of his professional career. Ultimately, the Bucks did not sign him. On August 3, 2021, Knight joined Brooklyn Nets for the 2021 NBA Summer League. On October 16, he signed with the New York Knicks, but was waived the same day.\nOn October 23, 2021, Knight was selected by the Sioux Falls Skyforce sixth overall in the 2021 NBA G League draft. In 11 games, he averaged 21.3 points, 5.5 assists, and 4.6 rebounds in 38.0 minutes, while making 3.2 three-pointers per game at a 35.7% rate.\nOn December 23, 2021, Knight signed a 10-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks, and on January 14, 2022, he was reacquired by Sioux Falls after the 10-day deal expired. On March 29, he signed a second 10-day contract with the Mavericks.\nPiratas de Quebradillas (2023–2024).\nOn March 14, 2023, Knight signed with the Piratas de Quebradillas of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional. He was later named the 2023 BSN Most Valuable Player Award and the 2023 BSN Scoring Champion with averages of 24.4 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.2 threes per game.\nPersonal life.\nKnight is the son of Efrem and Tonya Knight.\nKnight is a Christian."

        "title": "Rugby union in the Scottish Borders",
        "text": "Rugby union in the Scottish Borders has a long, and significant history.\nThe region has been responsible for several major innovations, and a presence in the national game which is disproportionately large, because it is the one part of Scotland where rugby is the main sport and played by all classes.\nHistory.\nFor centuries Borderers had been playing various forms of folk football, that were extremely similar to rugby. Some of these are still played very occasionally, such as the game in Jedburgh. Undoubtedly their popularity paved the way for that of rugby. Ned Haig, for example played Fastern's Eve Ba'.\nThroughout the mid-to-late-1870s, another almost parallel world of club rugby grew up in the Scottish Borders. This brand of rugby, imported from Yorkshire through the burgeoning woollen industry, was a world away from the refined old boy circuit of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The Borders remains the only part of Scotland – outside the predominantly middle-class atmosphere of the Edinburgh elite – where rugby really managed to take root in Scotland. In small towns where there was little or no association football, clubs such as Gala, Hawick, Selkirk, Jed Forest, and Melrose, soon became the sporting focus for the hardy farming communities nearby.\nAlthough the population of the Borders is only 100,000, its unique cauldron of local rivalries has produced some of the best players to come out of Scottish, or even European rugby. Many of the greatest Scottish sides, including those who won the Grand Slam of 1990, contained a substantial number of Borderers. It says much for the quality of play in the area that the towns from which the three most enduring club sides in Scotland hail from – Hawick, Galashiels and Melrose – have populations of 14,800, 12,300 and 1670 respectively.\nBorders rugby.\nThe area of Borders rugby is largely contiguous with Scottish Borders region, but also taking in Langholm and Biggar.\nAlthough the bulk of Borders rugby can be found in and around mid and lower Tweedsdale, the Border rugby region also takes in the likes of Langholm in Dumfriesshire in the south west, and Peebles, Innerleithen and Biggar (traditionally part of South Lanarkshire) in the west. The town of Berwick upon Tweed also has a strong association with the region, and its rugby club frequently plays against sides in the area.\nBorder League.\nAs well as being geographically and culturally divorced from their city counterparts, the Borders clubs soon developed a competition of their own, the Border League, which is still contested, and which remains the oldest organised league competition in world rugby.\nRugby sevens.\nThe Borders is also the birthplace of the abbreviated code of the sevens, which is somewhat ironic since Borders rugby has traditionally been built around forward muscle, rather than fluent back play.\nThe code was invented in 1883, when Melrose butcher and fly-half Ned Haig suggested a shortened version of the game, as a means of raising money at a local fair. The idea was a resounding success, with Melrose beating Gala in extra time to win the competition, and soon most towns in the Borders staged their own annual sevens tournaments in April and May.\nSo seriously do Borderers take the game, that when in 1983, the victorious French donated their Melrose Sevens winners' medals to the local lasses as a token of affection, that there was an uproar in the town. Borderers see a Melrose Sevens winners' medal as the next best thing to a Scottish cap.\nThe Melrose Cup is the main prize of the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and is named after this.\nSouth of Scotland.\nThe South of Scotland rugby union team (The South) is a select team made up of the best players from the Border region. They would take on overseas touring sides, drawing with South Africa on two occasions and famously beating an excellent 1984 Australia touring team. They also competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship against Edinburgh District, Glasgow District and the North and Midlands.\nIn 1995, with the advent of professionalism in Rugby union, the SRU decided to professionalise The South District team as the Border Reivers.\nBorder Reivers.\nThe Border Reivers were one of four professional sides set up by the SRU in 1996, from the traditional amateur District sides. The others were Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby and Caledonia Reds.\nTheir appearance was initially regarded with some suspicion and derision, yet it was due to the SRU's high debt that the axe fell on the Reivers just two years later. The Caledonia Reds met the same fate.\nThe Border Reivers were merged into Edinburgh Rugby in 1998, to form the Edinburgh Reivers. In effect, though, the Borders side was effectively disbanded. Edinburgh quietly dropped the Reivers name later.\nThe establishment of a Celtic League in 2001 gave the SRU more confidence. It resurrected the Border Reivers side in 2002 and they competed in the Celtic League, Heineken Cup and Challenge Cup. However the team largely struggled in the league.\nThe side was disbanded in 2007. The Reivers did pick up something of a following and their demise was a minor scandal. Part of the problem was that while the Borders have produced much of Scotland's best rugby, they did not necessarily have the population to support such a team.\nClubs.\nThe district includes clubs from the Scottish Borders as well as two clubs, Berwick and Langholm, and are actually situated in Northumberland and Dumfries &amp; Galloway respectively.\nBT Premiership.\nThe BT Premiership is the premier club competition over the Scottish Borders region.\nNational leagues.\nBT National Leagues is an amateur league competition for rugby union clubs in Scotland. It forms the 2nd tier of the Scottish League Championship.\nEast leagues.\nThe East leagues cover the Edinburgh &amp; District and the Scottish Borders area. They play at a level below that of the National Leagues structure. Winners of the league may progress to the National League.\nThe Scottish Borders consists of 17 clubs, the highest density of clubs per population in Scotland.\nNotable rugby players from the Borders.\nGala RFC\nHawick RFC\nJed Forest RFC\nKelso RFC\nMelrose RFC\nSelkirk RFC"

        "text": "Charles H. \"Fatty\" Smith was an American football center who played for the University of Michigan Wolverines football team in 1893 and 1894. Smith stood 5 feet, 10 inches, and weighed a hefty 230 pounds in 1893. In 1894, Smith anchored the line for one of the first great Michigan football teams. The 1894 Michigan team outscored opponents 244-84 and compiled a record of 9-1-1, including wins over Cornell University and the University of Chicago. Michigan's 1894 victory over Cornell marked the first victory by a Western football school against one of the Eastern football powers. Up to that point, no Western player had been selected for the annual College Football All-America Teams selected by Eastern football authorities, Caspar Whitney and Walter Camp. Smith was the standout star of Western football in 1894, and Western football enthusiasts lobbied for Smith to be selected as an All-American. Whitney and Camp declined the suggestion, and no Western football players would be selected as All-Americans until 1898, when Clarence Herschberger and William Cunningham received the honors. The resistance to selecting Smith (or any other Western player) as an All-American is reflected in the following newspaper account from December 1894:\"Some of the western colleges have developed great players on their teams and this year may claim for them a position on the All American team. Notably the University of Michigan claims for their center 'Fatty' Smith the supremacy in his position. But the western institutions have not yet mastered the eastern knowledge of all the details and fine points of the game. Smith has made a great record against the west and even against Cornell, but the Ithacan center was not a master of his position. When brought to face a man like the Stillman of today or the Bulliet of last year, Smith would simply be lost and entirely out generaled. So it would be with all of the claimants for line positions from western teams. And no one claims for a moment that western back field men could play in the same class with eastern men.\""

        "title": "Caribbean Sailing Yachts",
        "text": "Caribbean Sailing Yachts (CSY) is a company which built heavy-displacement recreational sailboats built during the 1970s and 1980s in Tampa, Florida. CSY was one of the first companies to recognize the impending growth of the Caribbean charter industry and although the company went out of business in the early 1980s, the well-founded boats have continued to sail the world's oceans for the past four decades. CSY's unique script logo was imprinted on a brass companionway medallion, dishware, and trailerboard design.\nThe CSY boats were sold directly from the factory, without any dealerships or middle-men. Two books were published showing all stages of construction. These books, entitled \"CSY Guide to Buying a Yacht\", were used as the primary means of promotion. One 168-page soft-cover book was published in 1977. A shorter 138-page version was republished in 1979. CSY also used a film strip, plant tours, boat shows and trial sails as sales tools. CSY published a 38-page soft-cover \"CSY Charter Manual\" (1979).\nIntroduction.\nCaribbean Sailing Yachts Corporation began as a charter company operating in the Caribbean. They were the first company to come up with the concept of charter ownership, pioneered by CSY founder and owner Dr. John Van Ost, a New Jersey dentist with a love of sailing. CSY developed and perfected the \"charter lease back\" program. In this program, an individual purchased the yacht and subsequently placed it into the charter fleet to cover the cost of the initial payments. \nPrior to the end of CSY, Dr. Van Ost envisioned the timeshare concept. He aimed to build the Corsair 81 mega yacht (considered mega in its day). These yachts would be available to multiple people to rent with crew. CSY originally purchased boats from companies such as Irwin. However, chartering demanded stronger boats to withstand bare-boat charter with less experienced captains and crew. \nCSY went into the boat manufacturing business, working initially with Ted Irwin, a well-known and successful designer of affordable cruising and racing sailboats in Tampa. Irwin heavily influenced the CSY 44 hull design. From 1975 to 1980, CSY built boats of between 33 and . They were similar in their appearance and hull shape. The designs feature a raised aft deck allowing for a large aft stateroom. CSY boats were built to unusually high standards of strength, durability, and quality consistent with Lloyd's design and boat building requirements.\nAlthough many of these new boats were purchased outright by their new owners, most, particularly the 44 walk-over model, were sold under an agreement that the boat would be in charter, run by the CSY Charter Company for a number of years, after which the boat would be paid off and revert to the \"original purchaser\". This system is a typical arrangement with many boats under charter even today. It is known as the \"charter lease back\" and is used by such companies as the Moorings and Sunsail.\nCSY 44s were built with either a deep or shallow draft. Deep-draft models were designed so that their draft could be modified and permanently changed to shoal draft. This enabled the same boat to initially be used as a deep-draft vessel in the Caribbean under charter, and then returned to their owner who could then make the draft modification so the boat could be cruised on the East Coast, the shallow Florida Keys, or the Bahamas.\nCSY developed several models including a 33, two layouts of a 37, the popular 44' \"Walkover\", a 44' \"Walk Through\", a 44' pilothouse, and a special purpose sailing / fishing vessel known as the Bottomliner.\nConstruction.\nThe CSY line was well-designed. Features like a built-in full-size trash receptacle in the galley, large refrigeration boxes (three boxes totaling on the CSY 44 WO), and a larger-than-king-size bed in the aft master cabin (CSY 44) made the boat comfortable in port as well as a good sea boat.\nCSY did not use wood lamination in its construction, a technique that is the curse of many boats of this vintage. The CSY hull is up to 1.5\" of solid fiberglass reinforced plastic resin with 14 dual layers (one sheet of fiberglass mat and one sheet of fiberglass weave = one layer). The avoidance of wood cores extends to the deck, which is also solid fiberglass. The only wood used in the construction of these boats are heavy laminated structural stringers, bulkheads and interior furniture.\nCSY models.\nCSY developed a full line of sailboats: the 33, the 37, the Carib 41, and the 44, of which two configurations were constructed i.e. the \"walk-over\", and the Pilothouse Ketch. Most of the 44s built were walk-overs, with a spacious cockpit and separate, unconnected staterooms forward and aft. Only much later did CSY build the 44 \"walk-through\" model, and only about 40 of these were built before CSY went out of business.\nCSY Carib 41.\nThe Carib 41 was the first production model destined for CSY's new charter bases in Tortola and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Designed by Alan Gurney, a total of 30 were built between 1970 and 1973. \nCSY 44.\nWalk-Over 44.\nThis model is referred to as \"walk-over\" because one has to walk up to the cockpit from the main salon and then down to the separate aft cabin.\nThe CSY 44 WO is typically what one thinks of when someone mentions a CSY. This is due to its use as a charter boat in the Caribbean in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nWalk Through 44.\nAbout 41 of these were built, with the last boat being number 42, completed outside the yard.\nThe CSY 44 Walk Throughs were built late in the production run and are sought after boats, mainly because of their walk-through configuration. While this design sacrifices some cockpit space in order to add the below-decks walkway from the main salon to the aft master stateroom, it is seen by many as a fair trade. It has a comfortable, conventional cockpit with ample room for guest visiting. There are two longitudinal bench seats long enough for sleeping and an ample bench seat aft of the central binnacle. Other layout differences from the Walk Over include a stand-up engine room with workbench to port, a main cabin navigation station/table to port, the galley with side-loading refrigerator/freezer aft located in the starboard passageway leading aft, and all-oak instead of teak interiors. Many of these boats were outfitted with a large fiberglass box on the stern deck suitable for fuel and gas storage. The after section of the main cabin coach roof is raised, adding headroom below and increasing visibility through four large windows.\nMany Walk Throughs were delivered with shoal draft and tall mast. The normal rig configuration was a cutter, with a few rigged as cutters/ketches. All of the WT masts were in the cutter position, and if a ketch, a mizzen would be added onto the aft deck with the boom extending far astern.\nCSY 44 Pilothouse.\nThis version of the CSY was delivered as a true ketch, which has the main mast moved forward from the cutter position of the other rigs. This true ketch rig was the only rig available on the Pilothouse 44. No staysail.\nCSY 44 Bottomliner.\nOnly six of the Bottom Line 44s were actually built. Only five actually saw service and were used in the CSY sponsored fishing school. The boats were sold to investors who then leased them back to CSY for use in the commercial fishing school. One of the inducements to attend the fishing school was that if a student went through the school and then captained one of the vessels for five years, the captain would then be eligible to buy the vessel at salvage value. This model was a CSY 44 hull and rigging modified to be a bottom fishing vessel. The idea was that the owner/fisherman could use the sail to help defer the cost of fuel when fishing. The original idea of the vessel was to have a large fish hold centered in the boat, with a crew compartment forward, a captain's quarters aft, and work center in the tall pilothouse. This commercial pilothouse provides a good visible with navigation counter, resting berth, and galley-sliding doors either side. A shaded area was built over the fish hold; side decks are continuous, with no steps or raised section aft.\nThe CSY Bottomliner was an excellent fishing platform for the grouper snapper fishery; it would fish in much heavier seas and at much greater depths than the standard vessels of the time. It was rigged with six large commercial bottom fishing reels called \"bandits\", for use in the grouper/snapper fishery. The vessels had all the latest electronics of the time, including dual marine FM radios and a single side band radio for long distance over the horizon communication. It also had multiple fish finding equipment, a whiteline recorder, and a color video recorder. The Bottomliner also had the latest in navigation with LORAN C, which would allow getting back to productive spots within about 100'. The boats were also equipped with radar as an aid to navigation.\nThe ice hold was equipped with large eutectic refrigeration plates that allowed ice to be kept in the five large bins on either side of the center line of the vessel for standard ten-day fishing trips. The hold also had a large freezer for storage of bait. This arrangement of ice and refrigeration only required running the diesel for approximately two hours a day to maintain temperatures in the hold, further saving on fuel and ice costs. Typically only about three tons of ice was needed for a 10-day trip, as opposed to the six to ten tons that a standard vessel typically required. Fuel was a major cost factor for the standard grouper snapper vessels. The standard diesel driven vessels of the time could use as much as 500 to 1000 gallons on a ten-day trip whereas the CSY typically used about 50 gallons and rarely used more than 100 gallons of its 500-gallon tankage. This pushed the break-even point down substantially, and increased profits proportionately.\nThese six fishing vessels were caught up in CSY's demise in 1981, and remained tied up to the docks in St. Petersburg for an extended period of time, suffering neglect and deterioration.\nCygnet 44.\nDuring the fifth year of manufacturing the CSY 44 in its various versions, the CSY Yacht Corporation came out with a new concept to reduce the cost of the yachts. This new version was marketed as the CYGNET 44 line. Shortly thereafter, the CSY Yacht Corporation went out of business. This must have happened in 1981. The CYGNET 44 WT was introduced at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show in 1980. The Cygnet did not have the trademark CSY hull ports on its bow.\nCSY 37.\nThe CSY 37 is an aft cockpit model with a roomy interior. It was built to the same high standards of construction as the CSY 44.\nCSY 33.\nThe CSY 33, designed by P. Schmitt, was the smallest CSY hull put into production. Like all CSYs it is a sturdily built boat that exhibits many of the CSY distinctive touches such as the scroll work on the bow. The CSY 33 was produced from 1979 to 1982. The 33 had a \"pilothouse-style\" main saloon, but did not have an inside steering station.\nGulfstar CSY 50.\nThis boat is often confused with the other CSYs on the market; however, it has no relationship to the CSY company.\nCSY history.\nCaribbean Sailing Yachts, Ltd. was unable to find a manufacturer who would build sailing yachts to the high standards it required for its charter service; therefore, C.S.Y. Yacht Corporation was founded by Caribbean Sailing Yachts, Ltd.'s chief executive officer, John R. Van Ost, on September 1, 1976.\nAt the start of 1976, a new plug and mold was built, and the first boat went into the water on January 15, 1977. Production gradually increased to seven CSY-44s per month by May of 1977.\nAlong the way, another version of the CSY-44 was designed and built. The CSY-44 Pilot House Ketch was introduced at the fall boat shows.\nA CSY-37 was designed, built, and shown for the first time at the Miami Boat Show in 1978. This was subsequently redesigned into two models, the two-stateroom model, and the one-stateroom model.\nIn the fall of 1978, the CSY-33 was introduced at Annapolis.\nFate.\nIt is said that CSY was a victim of building their boats too well, and that the business failed because the cost of the boats was too high for the price being asked. Some say this was due to their view of the business. Apparently the company viewed boat production simply as a means to supply their charter fleet in the Caribbean. CSY was not able to maintain this business model. Since their main customer was lease back for their charter business, the closing of tax loopholes most likely contributed to or accelerated their demise.\nAntigua Yachts, under the ownership of John Coats, purchased the CSY molds and boats in progress and started building the CSY 44 again, under the new name of Antigua 44. It is said that 20-30 of these highly customized versions of the CSY 44 walk-through were built in the 80s. Many of these boats had teak interiors versus the white oak or Formica interiors of the earlier CSYs. Antigua only made a few of these boats before going out of business, thus ending the CSY line of sailing yachts."

While the World Series of Poker was already drawing larger crowds as more and more amateurs sought it out, the SBOP \"was an affair limited almost exclusively to pros and hard-core amateurs.\"\nThe 1991 Tournament was the last SBOP. After Caesar's Casino in Las Vegas closed its poker room, Amarillo Slim had to find a new location for the event and the best deal that he could find forced participants to drive two hours. This resulted in the smallest SBOP fields ever; the Main Event only had 12 participants. Because of the small size of the field, fewer people were paid than in previous tournaments and the prestige of winning the events suffered a setback that doomed the SBOP and made 1991 the last year for the tournament.\nThe winners of the tournament, however, continued to represent some of the biggest names in poker. Barbara Enright, the only woman in the Poker Hall of Fame, won the ladies event. Jack Keller, another Hall of Famer, won two events, the $1,000 Pot Limit Omaha and the $10,000 Main Event. Having won the event in 1984, this was his second time to have won the $10,000 Main Event.\nPrior to SBOP, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP. \"The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament,\" Amarillo Slim said. Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979. Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament \"more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire.\" Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event.\nOne of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure. The WSOP's prize structure was flat, ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool. The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure. In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third. This payment schedule dominated in the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy."

It has a parkland course and has a total par of 71 over a medal tee yardage of 6411 yards.\nHistory.\nThe club's origins can be dated back to Easter Monday of 1906, which formed the official opening of Cannington Park Golf Club, later to become Enmore Park Golf Club. The origins of the course were not in the village of Enmore but in the village of Cannington and consisted of a 9-hole course of par 38 and length of just over 2200 yards.\nIn 1932 at the annual general meeting, it was decided that lengthening of the course was needed, and as this was not possible at Cannington Park, a new location had to be found. The most suitable of these locations was Enmore Park, which is the current location of Enmore Park Golf Club. It is within the parklands once held by Enmore Castle. The new 9-hole course was officially opened at 3 o'clock on 24 September 1932.\nThe original plans for a transition to an 18-hole golf course were laid out before the Second World War. However, only 14 holes managed to be constructed before the start of the war, and during the early war years advancements to the course were suspended. Also during this period the golf club suffered financial difficulties and was forced to sell off some of the holes and returned to a nine-hole course.\nIt was not until 16 May 1972 that Enmore Park managed to obtain a capacity 18-hole golf course, which was officially opened on 10 June of the same year.\nCompetitions.\nEnmore Park hosted the English Women's Amateur Stroke Play Championship in 2009.\nEnmore Park along with Burnham &amp; Berrow Golf Club was selected as the co-hosts of the 2011 R&amp;A Boys Amateur Championship which was played between 9 and 14 August.\nThe course.\nCourse record.\nThe medal course record from the white tees is currently held at a gross 62, 9 under par and was set by Taylor Stote in 2018."

It started on 8 October 2009 at Sixways Stadium in Worcester with Worcester Warriors hosting Montpellier, and ended with the final at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille on 23 May 2010. The reigning champions were Northampton Saints, who did not defend their title as they qualified for the 2009–10 Heineken Cup. Cardiff Blues won the trophy after a 28–21 win against Toulon.\nTeams.\nFive English teams and eight French teams competed because an English team – Leicester Tigers – progressed farther in the 2008–09 Heineken Cup than any French or Italian team.\nOther countries will have their usual number of teams: Ireland one, Romania one and one from Spain.\nPool stage.\nThe draw for the pool stages took place on 15 June 2009. The seeding system was the same as for the 2008–09 tournament. The 20 competing teams were ranked based on past Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup performance, with each pool receiving one team from each Tier. The requirement to have only one team per country in each pool was, however, still apply (with the exception of the inclusion of the sixth, seventh and eight French teams).\nBeginning with this season's competition, only the pool winners advanced to the knockout stage. They were joined by three clubs from the 2009–10 Heineken Cup, specifically the third through fifth highest-ranking teams that finished second in their pool (the top two second-place teams entered the Heineken Cup knockout stage).\nTeam seedings.\nSeeding was determined by the teams' position in the ERC Rankings at the time of the pool draw in June 2009.\nKnock-out stage.\nFinal.\nOn 28 April 2010, the competition organiser, European Rugby Cup, announced that the final would be held on 23 May. The time was set at 13:00 UTC (14:00 BST, 15:00 CEST), but the location would depend on the result of the Connacht–Toulon semi-final. Since Toulon won, the final was held at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille.\nCardiff Blues were designated as the home team for the final. However, it was an effective home game for Toulon; Stade Vélodrome hosted two of that club's matches in their domestic season. Cardiff Blues won the final against Toulon by 28–21."

He was team captain in 2005 and 2006, and led his team in every offensive category in 2006. Killian advanced to the Florida state finals in 2004 and 2005.\nCollege.\nSanchez has established himself as one of the most prolific hitters in Boston College Eagles baseball history. He ranks fifth all-time in home runs with 24 and runs batted in (RBI) with 124, sixth in hits with 202 and eighth in runs with 125.\nIn 2008, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox and was named a league all-star.\nIn 2009, Sanchez ranked eighth in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in runs (63), ninth in home runs (14), tenth in doubles (19) and slugging percentage (.614), twelfth in total bases (140), 16th in batting (.346) and 17th in hits (79) and on-base percentage (.443).

He was also the first player from Boston College to be voted to the All-ACC First Team. He also played for the Battle Creek Bombers of the Northwoods League.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nSanchez was selected 4th overall in the 2009 MLB draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, and became just the third catcher out of Boston College to be selected in the MLB Draft, and also the highest draft pick in Boston College history.\nSanchez made his professional debut for the Short-Season A State College Spikes on June 20, 2009. He played in four games for the Spikes before being promoted to the Single-A West Virginia Power. Sanchez finished the 2009 season with the Advanced-A Lynchburg Hillcats, and in 48 combined games that year, hit .309 with 7 home runs and 48 RBI.

He recorded his first Major League hit on June 23, 2013 – a double off of the Angels right hander Joe Blanton.

        "title": "George Nicol (baseball)",
        "text": "George Edward Nicol (October 17, 1870 – August 4, 1924) was an American baseball pitcher and outfielder who played three seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the St. Louis Browns, Chicago Colts, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Louisville Colonels from 1890 to 1894. Possessing the rare combination of batting right-handed and throwing left-handed, he served primarily as a right fielder when he did not pitch.\nSigned by the Browns without having previously played any minor league baseball, Nicol made his debut on September 23, 1890, and pitched—what was then considered to be—a no-hitter. The following season, he joined the Chicago Colts in July after starting in the minor leagues. After a two-year sojourn away from the major leagues, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1894. In August of the same season, he was traded to the Louisville Colonels, with whom he played his final major league game on September 29, 1894.\nPersonal life.\nNicol was born on October 17, 1870, in Barry, Illinois. His father, Matthew Nicol, immigrated to the United States from Scotland in 1852, while his mother, Eliza, was born in America. As a youngster, he played baseball for a semi-professional club in nearby Mount Sterling. There, he rose to fame as a left-handed pitcher—probably due to rarity and valuableness of southpaws—and eventually got the opportunity to play in the major leagues before he turned 20.\nAfter his professional baseball career ended, Nicol moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1896, he married his wife Lilian. Together, they had one son, George Jr., who was born in 1908. In order to support his new family, he became a machinist. During this time, he continued to play baseball—albeit amateur baseball—with the Milwaukee City League.\nOn the night of August 3, 1924, Nicol died in his sleep at the age of 53. His death was treated as suspicious, as a post-mortem examination found him to have four broken ribs that led to his death. He was interred at the Union Cemetery in Milwaukee.\nProfessional baseball career.\nSt. Louis Browns (1890).\nNicol was signed by the St. Louis Browns near the end of the season, even though he had no prior experience in minor league baseball. The team were in desperate need for players; their situation was a microcosm of the American Association (AA) that already had few players with major league experience to begin with. The league's precarious situation was not helped by the fact that they had to compete with both the well-established National League (NL) and the newly formed yet highly popular Players' League. Although the latter league lasted just one season, they were able to outdraw both the AA and NL in terms of attendance. This put a dent in the fortunes of the American Association, whose teams consequently struggled to pay the players' salaries and thus, had to utilize amateur, semi-professional, or minor league players.\nNicol made his major league debut for the Browns on September 23, 1890, starting the game against the Philadelphia Athletics that resulted in a 21–2 win. He did not allow a single hit to the Athletics through seven innings, after which the game was called off due to darkness. Although the game was previously considered a no-hitter, a rule change made by the MLB's Committee on Statistical Accuracy in 1991 redefined the definition of a no-hitter; a no-hit game now had to span a minimum of nine innings. As a result, Nicol's debut was one of fifty no-hitters deleted from the official record books.\nThree days after his debut, Nicol faced the Athletics again in his second major league start. He followed up his dazzling debut with another solid performance, giving up just one hit—a single—in a 7–3 win that ended after five innings. His subsequent starts were disappointing, most notably a 10–3 loss against the Toledo Maumees, where his inability to hold baserunners was first exposed. He finished the season with a win–loss record of 2–1, a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), and had 16 strikeouts but walked 19 in three games started. After his contract expired at the end of the season, no major league team signed Nicol, so he began the season with the Davenport Pilgrims, a minor league baseball team that competed in the Illinois–Iowa League.\nChicago Colts (1891).\nNicol's tenure with the Pilgrims was successful, albeit brief. He compiled a 15–8 record with a 1.36 ERA in 23 games started and threw five shutouts. He soon demonstrated himself as the best pitcher in the league by holding opposing teams to three hits or less in four separate games. His pitching performances caught the eye of Chicago Colts manager Cap Anson, who offered him a $225 a month contract. Nicol originally agreed to the deal, but subsequently wanted to renege, citing \"a change of heart.\" However, he was eventually forced to accept the offer when the Colts threatened to blacklist him. The Pilgrims, who were already struggling financially, received just $300 from the Colts for their ace and folded soon after he left the team.\nNicol arrived in Chicago on July 20 and was penciled in to start on consecutive days against Charles Radbourn and Cy Young. Though he performed poorly in both games, the Colts still managed to win. He was shelled in the third inning by the Cincinnati Reds, and on the next day, he gave up seven runs to the Cleveland Spiders in only two innings. Because of these starts, he did not appear in another game until August 14, when he was used in relief to face the Brooklyn Dodgers. His control issues flared up, and he had trouble holding the Dodgers' baserunners. He was released one week later, having walked 10 batters in the 11 innings he pitched for the Colts. He ended the season playing for Marinette of the Wisconsin State League.\nMinor league sojourn.\nAfter 1891, Nicol went back to the Illinois–Iowa League and joined the Rockford Hustlers. He pitched well throughout the season—though his record was 16–16, he had a 1.47 ERA, 230 strikeouts in 288 innings pitched, and pitched five shutouts. He limited his opponents to two hits in five different complete games and threw a one-hitter. The league, however, was struggling financially, and after the end of the league's postseason, his request for release was granted.\nAt the start of , Nicol signed with the Los Angeles Angels of the California League. A new rule was introduced stipulating that the pitcher's mound be away from home plate. This increase of five feet in distance gave batters a greater advantage. Despite this, Nicol was noted for his ability to adapt to the new rule better than other pitchers in the league. This was evident as he was able to garner a 15–8 record and 0.86 ERA in 188 innings pitched. His control suffered, however, as he struck out just 64 batters and walked 125, thus contributing to his 1.66 WHIP that season. In early June, there was speculation that players would have their salaries cut in order to sustain the league, which was allegedly on the verge of collapsing. Several weeks after two of his teammates departed, Nicol himself left the team, joining the two in the Eastern League with the Erie Blackbirds. He continued his stellar pitching performances with a 13–9 record and a 1.80 ERA in 200 innings, while reducing the number of walks issued to 89.\nPittsburgh Pirates and Louisville Colonels (1894).\nNicol signed for the Pittsburgh Pirates at the start of the season. His stint with the team was dismal, as he posted a 3–4 record with a 6.22 ERA, while his control and strikeout ability continued to diminish, evident with his 39 walks issued against a mere 13 strikeouts in 9 games pitched. On August 13, he was traded to the Louisville Colonels in exchange for Jock Menefee and $1000.\nIn his first game for the Colonels, Nicol was battered by the opposing team, giving up 19 hits and 15 earned runs in a complete game. He made just one more start for the team and finished with a 13.76 ERA over 17 innings pitched. Because of his pitching struggles, he changed positions and played 26 games in the outfield during his time with the organization, making 43 putouts, 2 assists, and committed 9 errors, resulting in a .791 fielding percentage. His overall statistics for the year were mixed. His pitching record was 3–5 with an 8.24 ERA, 17 strikeouts, and 55 walks issued over 63 innings pitched. However, his offensive numbers were impressive, as he posted a batting average of .351 and amassed 47 hits, 7 doubles, 4 triples, 22 runs batted in, and a .463 slugging percentage in 141 plate appearances, while striking out just 5 times. At the conclusion of the season, he was released by the Colonels.\nBack to the minors.\nNicol returned to minor league baseball, joining the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the Western League. After spending just one month with the team, he moved within the league to the Milwaukee Brewers, where he played for five seasons and was utilized exclusively as an outfielder from onwards. In 1896, he was at the center of controversy when the Philadelphia Phillies drafted him and promised the Brewers that they would return him should they not be in need of his services. However, he was instantly outrighted to the Detroit Tigers, with the Phillies' president acknowledging that they were assisting and collaborating with the Tigers, who had requested the transaction. The case went to an arbitral tribunal, which ruled in favor of the Brewers.\nIn , Nicol joined the Wilkes-Barre Coal Barons of the Atlantic League. The league disbanded in June of that year, whereupon he joined the Detroit Tigers, who were now part of the American League. He was released at the end of the season, having batted .258 in 73 games. He returned to the now-expanded Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in and played there for two seasons. His career after is unclear, although the Society for American Baseball Research writes that he signed with a Wisconsin State League team based in Freeport, Illinois, and played for them for the remainder of the year before retiring from professional baseball."

        "title": "1926 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The first Grand Prix of the Royal Automobile Club, commonly referred to as the 1926 British Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor race held at the Brooklands circuit on 7 August 1926.\nIt was the fourth race of the 1926 AIACR World Manufacturers' Championship season, and the first-ever British Grand Prix.\nCircuit.\nThe full banked Outer Circuit was not used for the Grand Prix. Instead cars continued straight on at The Fork and drove up the Finishing Straight (rather than bearing right to take the full length of the Members' Banking), on which two sandbank chicanes were constructed, one at either end of the straight, before rejoining the Outer Circuit, having cut out entirely the section passing behind the Members' Hill. Between the chicanes and just before the finishing line the cars were funnelled through the right-hand span of the footbridge which had been built for the occasion across the straight and which had two supports resting on the track itself. \nThis arrangement gave a circuit length of around 4.21 km, so – together with the fact that the race started at the top of the Finishing Straight, meaning that the first lap was not the full 4.21km and included only one of the two chicanes – the 110 lap race was 462 km, less than the 600 km minimum mandated by the regulations of the 1926 World Manufacturers' Championship, but nonetheless the race still counted.\nReport.\nThe race attracted one of the better entries of the 1926 season, with thirteen cars listed in the official programme – albeit that two of these were the privately-owned Talbot and Bugatti cars entered by Malcolm Campbell for himself to drive, the popular British privateer opting for the Bugatti the day before the race. With the works Bugatti team not entering the race, firm favourites to win were the Delages of Robert Benoist, Louis Wagner and Robert Sénéchal. The three new French built Talbots were painted green in order to promote the British arm of S.T.D Motors, but braking issues put them at a disadvantage. Finally there were the modified Aston Martin of George Eyston, Frank Halford's Halford Special (itself based on an Aston Martin chassis), two Thomas \"Flat Iron\" Specials (an unsupercharged version for J. G. Parry-Thomas and a supercharged model for Clive Gallop) and a front-wheel drive Alvis for Maurice Harvey. Mechanical problems led to both Thomas Specials and the Alvis being withdrawn, meaning that nine cars lined up for the start.\nAt the start, Albert Divo took an immediate lead, followed initially by Campbell and Eyston, while the Delages of Sénéchal and Wagner made very slow starts. By the end of the banking coming onto the Finishing Straight, the other two Talbots had taken second and third place, making it a Talbot 1–2–3, Divo–Jules Moriceau–Henry Segrave. This was short lived, however, as when Moriceau braked for the first sandbank, his front wheels wobbled wildly causing the front axle to collapse, putting him out of the race. By the end of the first lap, Benoist had moved up to third place.\nOver the next five laps, Divo and Segrave tried to pull away from Benoist, and although much faster under acceleration they were unable to do so due to the Talbot's inferior braking. Meanwhile Sénéchal had started moving up the field, making up for his poor start, but his team-mate Wagner had made several pitstops due to a misfiring engine, eventually retiring after 6 laps. After 7 laps, Divo's engine too started misfiring, forcing him to pit, dropping him to last place. By lap 10 Sénéchal had moved up to third place, behind Segrave and Benoist, while Halford had overtaken Campbell for fourth place.\nOn lap 15, Segrave stopped to change a damaged tire, dropping him to third, while Divo was trying to make up ground, having overtaken Eyston's slow Aston Martin for sixth place. Benoist was now two laps ahead of everyone, and his lead increased every lap. On lap 35, Benoist stopped to change his rear tires, but did not lose the lead to Segrave who had overtaken Sénéchal. Meanwhile Divo made another long pitstop, dropping him back to last place, and well out of contention.\nBoth engine and brake problems then followed for Segrave, making several pitstops to investigate the issues, dropping him right back, and eventually retiring after 62 laps. Eyston suffered a similar fate, retiring with a blown gasket. Segrave's trouble promoted Halford up into third place, but not for long as Campbell was quickly gaining on him. A pitstop for Sénéchal only served to increase Benoist's now huge lead of several laps. Halford made a slow stop, dropping him behind Campbell until he too made a pitstop. However Halford was to lose third place again, passed by the charging Divo.\nBenoist too made a pitstop, and had some trouble restarting his engine, causing his lead to reduce considerably, but was able to restart still with more than a lap in hand over Sénéchal. The high temperatures were causing the drivers problems, especially the Delages and the remaining Talbot of Divo. Benoist stopped on his 81st lap with his exhaust glowing white hot, wrapping some asbestos sheeting around it to stop it from burning through the car. An issue with Sénéchal's exhaust made the problem even worse, forcing him to stop on lap 83 and hand over to Wagner. Halford also had trouble on his 83rd lap, retiring with a broken prop shaft, pushing the car all the way back to the pits.\nWagner was now in a lot of pain, forcing him to stop frequently to dip his feet in water due to the intense heat, causing his lead to dwindle. After a valiant fight, Divo too needed to stop frequently, but his car then refused to restart, forcing him to retire after 87 laps. This left just three cars for the final 15 laps. Benoist handed his car over to Dubonnet (who had not driven a lap of the circuit before and was wearing an ordinary blue lounge suit), who was being chased now by Campbell's Bugatti. Both drivers were still trying to catch Wagner, who was stopping frequently to bathe his feet, but this was not the case, with Wagner eventually winning with over four laps lead. Dubonnet struggled with flames coming from his engine, and having to learn the circuit as he drove, allowing Campbell to close the gap, and on lap 102 overtake him for second place, which he held to the end."

        "text": "The Dutch Basketball League (DBL), formerly the Eredivisie, was the highest professional basketball league in the Netherlands, run by the Federatie Eredivisie Basketball (FEB). Since 2021, the league has been replaced by the Belgian-Dutch BNXT League.\nThe league had a closed system: to participate, a team has to have enough money and potential. The league began in 1960 as the \"Eredivisie\" and was organized by the NBB and later the FEB. In 1977 the league introduced play-offs. As of 2019, the Dutch Basketball League consists of ten teams and plays under the FIBA rules.\nHistory.\n2010s.\nStarting with the 2010–11 season, the Eredivisie changed its name to the Dutch Basketball League, shortly the DBL. The beginning of the 2010s saw Donar and ZZ Leiden emerge as top teams in the Netherlands. Donar won five titles, including three straight (2015–2018). The decade also saw clubs disappear due to financial problems, with Amsterdam in 2011, West-Brabant Giants in 2011,\nMagixx in 2014. The decade also saw the emergence of new clubs in Apollo Amsterdam and Den Helder Suns.\nIn Europe, Donar had one of the biggest successes in Dutch history after reaching the semi-finals of the 2017–18 FIBA Europe Cup. It was the first European semi-final of a team since Amsterdam in 2001.\n2020s.\nIn December 2019, it was announced that the DBL has partnered with the Belgian Pro Basketball League (PBL) to look at the potential of a future \"BeNe League\". The 2019–20 season was cancelled prematurely in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first time in league history that a season was not finished and no champions were named. Due to the pandemic, entry requirements for the following season were lowered which led to the entrance of Basketball Community Gelderland, The Hague Royals and Almere Sailors.\nFormat and rules.\nEach team has to play all the other teams in the league four times, twice at home and twice away. This means that the league's regular season ends after all teams play 36 matches. Like many other national domestic leagues in continental Europe, the Dutch Basketball League takes a winter break once each team has played half of its scheduled games.\nPlayoffs.\nAt the end of the league season schedule, the eight best teams in the standings play in a play-off, pitting the first place team in the standings versus the eighth place team in the standings, and so on. The quarter finals are played in a best-of-three format and the semi-finals are played in a best-of-five format, and the finals are played in a best-of-seven format.\nIn seasons were the number of teams dropped to 9 or lower, six teams qualified for the playoffs.

        "title": "Grunting in tennis",
        "text": "Grunting in tennis is a loud noise made by some players while hitting their shots. Such noises have sometimes been described as \"shrieking\" or \"screaming\".\nMonica Seles, Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe are generally considered to be the \"grunt creators\" in the women's and men's games, respectively. Examples of contemporary tennis players who grunt are Serena Williams, Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, Aryna Sabalenka, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Dominic Thiem, David Ferrer, and Gustavo Kuerten. However, some players such as Djokovic have reduced their grunting habits as their career has progressed, although hindrance from Djokovic's grunting earned Jannik Sinner, his opponent, a point in the semifinals of the 2023 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles.\nOverview and punishment.\nIn the 1988 US Open, Ivan Lendl complained about Andre Agassi's grunting: \"When Agassi went for a big shot, his grunt was much louder. It threw off my timing\". In the 2009 French Open, Aravane Rezaï complained to the umpire about Michelle Larcher de Brito's \"shrieking\", which led to a Grand Slam supervisor being brought to the court. No action was taken against Larcher de Brito and she was booed off the court. Afterwards former tennis player Martina Navratilova said that grunting was a form of cheating: \"The grunting has reached an unacceptable level. It is cheating, pure and simple. It is time for something to be done\". She also cited Roger Federer as an example of a successful player who does not grunt: \"Roger Federer doesn't make a noise when he hits the ball—go and listen\". The concern was not limited to mere distraction or unpleasantness. In particular, Navratilova was concerned that grunting drowned out the sound of the ball leaving the grunter's racquet and prevented an experienced opponent from using that clue as to force and spin to address his or her reception of the ball and the return stroke. Another former player, Chris Evert, stopped short of labelling it as cheating but said: \"I wouldn't go that far [to say it's cheating] but I think the grunts are getting louder and more shrill now with the current players\".\nSome tennis players have defended grunting. Michelle Larcher de Brito, who had a reported decibel reading of 109, said: \"If people don't like my grunting, they can always leave\". In a different interview she said: \"Nobody can tell me to stop grunting. Tennis is an individual sport and I'm an individual player. If they have to fine me, go ahead, because I'd rather get fined than lose a match because I had to stop grunting\". Former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova stated, \"I've done this ever since I started playing tennis and I'm not going to change\". Serena Williams said that opponents grunting does not affect her: \"I just play my game and sometimes I grunt and sometimes I don't. I'm not conscious when I'm doing it. I'm just zoned out. It doesn't really affect me if my opponent is [grunting]\".\nSome players and commentators have noted the connection with pro tennis trainer Nick Bollettieri, who has personally trained the majority of the controversially loud \"grunters\" including Larcher de Brito, Seles, Sharapova, Agassi, and the Williams sisters, leading to repeated accusations that he has been deliberately teaching grunting as a novel tactic in order to give his latest generation of students an edge in competitive play. Bollettieri has denied teaching grunting as a distraction tactic, and says grunting is natural, \"I prefer to use the word 'exhaling'. I think that if you look at other sports, weightlifting or doing squats or a golfer when he executes the shot or a hockey player, the exhaling is a release of energy in a constructive way\". In 2011, after Danish player Caroline Wozniacki (then world no. 1) publicly accused Bollettieri's students of cheating by grunting, Women's Tennis Association Chairman Stacy Allaster stated that the WTA would be \"talking to the Bollettieri academy\" about the predominance of loud grunters from that institution and how it could be eliminated from the next generation of players. One year later, a division of Bollettieri's academy released a document calling grunting \"unsportsmanlike\" and acknowledging that it obscures the sound of string impact (as noted by Navratilova), resulting in \"an increase in an opponent's decision error, and a slower response time\".\nLouise Deeley, a sports psychologist at Roehampton University, believes that grunting is part of the rhythm for tennis players: \"The timing of when they actually grunt helps them with the rhythm of how they're hitting and how they're pacing things\". She also believes that banning grunting is not the solution: \"They may feel, on the surface, that this is going to be a distraction to their game, that it is part and parcel of what they do\". Bruce Lynne, a physiologist at University College London, believes that reflexes might have an effect: \"If you're looking at reflexes in the legs and you ask someone to clench their jaw, then believe it or not, the reflexes in their legs get brisker, that's a well-known problem called re-enforcement\"."

In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points."

Morgan was brought in as a replacement for Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs and was paired at half back with another Cardiff player, Ralph Sweet-Escott. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales faced Ireland in a 'wooden spoon' decider, with both countries having already lost against England and Scotland. Wales won the game 5-3, thanks to an inventive try from Tom Pearson. The next season the Welsh selectors kept faith with Morgan bringing him into the team for the opening game of the 1896 Championship. This time the selectors chose a Llanelli pairing, bringing in Ben Davies, to whom this was also his second international. The match was a sporting disaster for Wales, losing 25-0, and although the forwards took the brunt of the blame, the selectors also reacted by dropping both Morgan and Davies, neither of whom ever represented Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Leo Lyons (American football)",
        "text": "Leo V. Lyons (March 11, 1892 – May 18, 1976) was a co-founder of the National Football League (NFL). He was a player, manager, coach and owner of the Rochester Jeffersons from 1908 to 1925.\nEarly career.\nLyons started out as a 16-year-old player, in 1908, for the Rochester Jeffersons semi-pro football team. By 1910, he was manager as well as a player of the team, who guided the Jeffersons to the Rochester city championship. As a manager, Leo recruited one of pro football's first African-American players, Henry McDonald.\nManager and owner.\nYears later, Lyons became owner of the team. By the time the Jeffersons were an NFL team, he served the team as a manager, owner, photographer, doctor, counselor, financier, field worker, game booker, agent, and scout. He also was the manager of a basketball team, comprising his football players, to keep the team in shape. Lyons developed ambitions for the team. He took the Jeffersons to Canton, Ohio, early in the 1917 season to play the Canton Bulldogs, led by Jim Thorpe. Canton won the game easily, 41-0. However this led Lyons to study and adopt the Bulldogs way of recruiting and playing. In 1919, he brought in some outside players and the Jeffersons won the city semi-pro championship with ease, eventually finishing runner up in the state championship to their rivals in Buffalo.\nForming the NFL.\nOn September 17, 1920, Lyons represented Rochester at a meeting of the nation's leading pro football team managers held in Canton, for the purpose of creating the American Professional Football Association (later known as the National Football League in 1922). The Jeffersons were charter members of the organization and played in the league from 1920–25.\nForfeit controversy.\nOn December 5, 1921, a game was scheduled between the Jeffersons and the Washington Senators. Lyons refused to play the game. According to Lyons, the Senators had a poor fan turnout due to a snowstorm and said they would only pay the Jeffersons roughly $200. That amount would not allow for the team to be paid to play the game, or even meet its travel expenses for the trip back to Rochester. The game had an NFL guarantee that the Jeffersons must be paid $800 for the game regardless of anything. Lyons refused to play the game because of Washington not paying the $800 that was in the game contract. Later, NFL commissioner Joseph Carr ruled in favor of Lyons and the Jeffs. The Elias Sports Bureau has not recognized this game as a forfeit and official NFL standings also say it was not a forfeit.\nDemise of the Jeffs.\nBy the early 1920s, Lyons had encountered a conundrum. Despite his investments, the Jeffersons were never able to consistently compete with other members of the league, but the team was far better than the semi-pro local squads that occupied the Rochester area. That meant that the Jeffersons' games were almost certain to be blowouts in one direction or the other, resulting in a boring product that Rochester residents were not willing to pay to see. After investing almost all of his personal wealth (including mortgaging his house) into the team, Lyons ran out of money in 1925 and was forced to suspend the team. The inactive team was left in limbo for the next two seasons before the NFL canceled Lyons's franchise at the 1928 owners' meetings.\nHonors.\nLyons served as an Honorary Historian of the NFL from after the Jeffersons folded until his death, maintaining connections with some of the owners from his era, including George Halas. While not entirely flawless and often heavily weighted toward his own Jeffersons, his histories were considered better and more accurate than Harry March's , and Bob Carroll, founder of the Professional Football Researchers Association, noted that Lyons had \"served well\" in that capacity. He was a major advocate of, and contributor to, the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he himself was nominated several times but has never been inducted."

        "text": "An indoor cricket court (also known as an arena of field) is the playing area used in a game of indoor cricket. The court measures 30 metres × 12 metres, and is enclosed by tight netting 7.5 metres high. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting, with a set of plastic spring-back stumps at each end of the pitch, each measuring 71.1 cm above the floor. \nThe pitch.\nThe length of an indoor cricket pitch is the same as a conventional cricket pitch, and has 3 stumps at each end, but there the similarities end. The pitch is marked in line with the stumps at each end, and is 1.83 metres in width at the batting end and 2.47 metres at the bowling end, with the stumps in the centre, and the middle stumps are 20 metres apart. The popping crease is in front of, and parallel with, the wicket lines at both ends. At the bowler's end, the pitch is specified as the line extending between the return creases and will be called the bowler's crease or the front foot line. The return creases of the pitch at the bowler's end is marked by a lines at right angles to the bowling crease to the line of the wickets. The return creases are marked 1.22 metres from the middle stump on the line of the wicket. The running crease (or non-striking batter's crease), which is the edge of the crease marking nearest the bowling end, is parallel to the popping crease and extends from one side of the court to the other. The distance between the running crease and the batting crease is 11 metres. \nScoring zones.\nScoring in indoor cricket is split into 2 areas: physical runs and bonus runs. Physical runs are scored by both batsmen completing a run from one crease to the other. Bonus runs are scored when the ball hits a net. Bonus scores for particular parts of the nets follow:\nAn indoor cricket court is divided into 4 scoring zones, each represented by a letter of the alphabet.\nNB: For bonus runs to be scored, at least one physical run must be scored. The bonus runs are then added to the physical runs.\nFielding positions.\nFielding positions in indoor cricket are set to achieve two main goals, defend runs and take wickets. The rules specify that there must be 4 players in each half of the court at the time a ball is bowled. Fielding positions are often broken down into two groups, front court and back court, each of which is described below. The diagram below outlines the locations of these fielding positions on the court\nFront court.\nCommon front court fielders include the\nThe role of the wicket keeper is to take catches behind the stumps, stump the batsmen if he is not in his crease, and to assist in run outs at the strikers end. The 1st, 2nd and leg side guards aim to stop the ball from hitting the side net, therefore limiting the runs scored by the batting team. \nBack Court.\nCommon back court fielding positions include the\nThe receiver stands at the non strikers end stumps, and has a similar role to the wicket keeper in taking run outs at this end. The receiver also defends the back net. The role of the two sweepers is to both defend scoring zone C and to pick up any loose balls behind the receiver once the ball has been hit. The bowlers job is to, as the name suggests, to deliver the ball. "

        "text": "The 1972 Rose Bowl was the 58th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Saturday, January 1. The Stanford Indians of the Pacific-8 Conference upset the undefeated and fourth-ranked Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten Conference by a point, repeating as Rose Bowl champions. The Player of the Game was Stanford quarterback Don Bunce.\nTeams.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan started the season with a win at preseason #20 Northwestern. They rose to as high as second in the rankings by winning their next eight games by a combined score including three straight shutouts over non-conference opponents (Virginia, UCLA, Navy) by an aggregate of 134–0.\nBut the Wolverines were almost caught looking ahead to their showdown with rival Ohio State, and escaped with a win at Purdue. They then beat the unranked Buckeyes to finish as undefeated Big Ten champions. It was the Wolverines' first undefeated regular season in 33 years, and they made their second appearance in the Rose Bowl under third-year coach Bo Schembechler.\nStanford Indians.\nThe Indians had won the previous year's Rose Bowl behind the heroics of Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett, who was the first pick of the 1971 NFL Draft. Plunkett's backup Don Bunce, running back Jackie Brown, and the \"Thunderchickens\" defense, led Indians to an 8–3 record in 1971 and a return appearance in the Rose Bowl. Stanford's key wins came against Dan Fouts and Oregon (38–17), at USC (33–18), and at eleventh-ranked Washington (17–6), led by quarterback Sonny Sixkiller.\nStanford concluded the regular season with three home games, the first over struggling UCLA, a 20–9 win that was tied at three at halftime. However, they were caught looking ahead to the Rose Bowl decider vs. rival California, and were upset by San Jose State 13–12, a non-conference game in which kicker Rod Garcia missed all five kicks; four field goal attempts and an extra point try. They rebounded and ended the regular season with a 14–0 shutout over archrival Cal to secure the Pac-8 title.\nThis Rose Bowl was the last football game that Stanford played as the \"Indians,\" which was abolished by the university in March 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate. Stanford's athletic teams became the \"Cardinals,\" referring to the school's primary color; it was reduced to the singular \"Cardinal\" in 1982.\nGame summary.\nMichigan came into the game on New Year's Day ranked fourth, but had little hope of winning the national championship as #1 Nebraska was facing #2 Alabama in the Orange Bowl that night (won by Nebraska, It was the first Rose Bowl meeting between the two schools since the inaugural seventy years earlier in 1902, in which Michigan crushed Stanford In the 1972 rematch, Michigan was favored by 10½ points.\nThe game started slowly, as rain the previous week had made the turf soggy and both teams showed stout defense. In the first quarter, Stanford placekicker Rod Garcia attempted field goals from 52 and 55 yards, but missed both. Michigan kicker Dana Coin made a 30-yard field goal in the second quarter for the only score in the first half. In the first series of the second half, Stanford stopped the Wolverines on 4th and 1 at Stanford's 4-yard line, then marched down to tie the game on Garcia's 42-yard field goal.\nAs the fourth quarter began, Michigan's Fritz Seyferth scored on a one-yard dive to put Michigan up 10–3. After Stanford got the ball back, they faced fourth and ten from their own 33. Coach Ralston called for a fake punt, with Jim Kehl receiving the snap and handing the ball forward to Jackie Brown, through his legs; he ran 33 yards for a first down, and followed up a minute later with a 24-yard touchdown run to tie the game.\nLate in the fourth quarter, Michigan recovered a Stanford fumble near midfield. Facing fourth down with time running down, the Wolverines attempted a 46-yard field goal. The kick was short and right, and Stanford safety Jim Ferguson caught the ball and attempted to run it out of the end zone. He advanced to the seven but cut to the center and retreated; he was knocked back into the end zone by Ed Shuttlesworth for a controversial Michigan safety, as replays seemed to show that Ferguson's forward progress was to the 3-yard line. The official that made the call was back judge William Quimby of the Big Ten. This made the score 12–10 with just over three minutes to play, and Michigan due to get the ball on a free kick.\nFollowing the free kick from the twenty, Michigan started from their own 45; they kept the ball on the ground but the Indians held for a three-and-out, and Stanford called a timeout prior to the punt. They got the ball back on their own 22-yard line with 1:48 to go. Bunce then threw five consecutive completions to take Stanford to the Michigan 17 with 22 seconds left. The Indians ran two more running plays followed by timeouts to get to the 14-yard-line with sixteen seconds left, and Garcia successfully kicked a 31-yard field goal to give Stanford its first lead and a 13–12 upset.\nAftermath.\nThis was the final Rose Bowl contested under the Big Ten's \"no-repeat\" policy, which prohibited conference teams from appearing in the game in back-to-back seasons. rule was repealed \nBunce finished 24 of 44 for 290 yards and was named the game's MVP. He played one year of professional football in the Canadian Football League before leaving football to become a successful orthopedic surgeon, eventually serving as team doctor for Stanford's football team from 1982 to 1992. The game was the last football game Stanford played as the \"Indians\", becoming the \"Cardinals\" the following year before eventually becoming the singular \"Cardinal\" (the color) by 1981. Stanford would not return to the Rose Bowl until 2000 and did not win another Rose Bowl until 2013.\nTwo Indians were top 10 selections in the 1972 NFL Draft. Offensive tackle Greg Sampson went sixth overall to the Houston Oilers, and linebacker Jeff Siemon went 10th to the Minnesota Vikings. Siemon was the Vikings' starting middle linebacker in three Super Bowl losses (VIII, IX and XI, the last of which was the first Super Bowl played at the Rose Bowl stadium) and played 11 seasons for the club. Sampson played seven seasons in Houston and had a role in the 1974 film \"The Longest Yard\".\nRalston departed Palo Alto shortly after the Rose Bowl to accept the head coaching position of the National Football League's Denver Broncos, continuing a trend of college coaches moving to the NFL which began the previous year with Dan Devine (Missouri to the Green Bay Packers) and Tommy Prothro (UCLA Bruins to the Los Angeles Rams), and continued with Chuck Fairbanks (Oklahoma to the New England Patriots), Don Coryell (San Diego State to the St. Louis Cardinals), Rick Forzano (Navy to the Detroit Lions), Lou Holtz (North Carolina State to the New York Jets), John McKay (USC to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) and Dick Vermeil (UCLA to the Philadelphia Eagles). The Broncos did not make the playoffs during any of Ralston's five seasons (1972–1976), but he acquired many of the players who formed the nucleus of Denver's legendary \"Orange Crush\" defense which led the franchise to Super Bowl XII under rookie coach Red Miller in 1977. Under Ralston, the Broncos experienced their first winning season, a campaign \nMichigan fell to sixth in the AP poll, trailing three schools from the Big Eight Conference (Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado), Alabama, and Penn State. The Wolverines did not play in a bowl game in 1972, 1973, or 1974, despite a regular season record of in that period. Michigan was done in an 0–2–1 record vs. Ohio State, with the losses, both in Columbus, by a combined five points, and the Big Ten's \"Rose Bowl or No Bowl\" policy, also observed by the Pac-8, which was rescinded before the 1975 season. This allowed an Michigan team (which again lost to Ohio State) the opportunity to play in the Orange Bowl. The Wolverines and Buckeyes tied in 1973, but Ohio State received the Rose Bowl berth on a 6–4 vote of Big Ten athletic directors.\nSchembechler's Wolverines returned to three consecutive Rose Bowls from 1977 to 1979, but lost all three (by 8, 7, and 7 points). In 1981, the Wolverines finally won their first bowl game under the legendary coach, breaking a six-game losing streak in the Rose Bowl by the Big Ten. Fittingly, Schembechler's 21-year career at Michigan ended with a loss in the 1990 Rose Bowl, leaving him 2–8 in the \"Grandaddy Of Them All,\" as he finished with a 2–8 record in Rose Bowls.\nReferee Jerry Markbreit later became the first to serve as referee in four Super Bowls (XVII, XXI, XXVI, XXIX; the first two in Pasadena) during his 23-year NFL officiating career (1976–98), but this was his only bowl game as a college official. William Quimby, the back judge who made the controversial safety call against Stanford, later officiated in the NFL for many years, working Super Bowl XIX following the 1984 season."

During his time at Michigan State, he played for the football team, where he was named an All-Big Ten player.\nCareer.\nButler joined the Green Bay Packers prior to the 1934 NFL season as an offensive lineman. In his first season with the Packers, he played the first four games of the year. However, he informed head coach Curly Lambeau that he had to resign his spot on the team after he accepted a government job as an inspector. Butler signed with the Packers again prior to the 1935 NFL season after securing a leave of absence from his government job. During the 1935 season, Butler suffered a severe shoulder injury.

        "title": "World Series",
        "text": "The World Series is the annual final championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It has traditionally been held in October, though some more recent editions were contested in November due to expanded playoffs and/or season delays. It has been contested since 1903 between the champion teams of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.\nPrior to the AL and NL being split into divisions in 1969, the team with the best regular-season win–loss record in each league automatically clinched its league's pennant and advanced to the World Series, barring the rare tie necessitating a pennant playoff. Since then each league has conducted a League Championship Series (ALCS and NLCS) preceding the World Series to determine which teams will advance, while those series have been preceded in turn by Division Series (ALDS and NLDS) since 1995, and Wild Card games or series in each league since 2012. Until 2002, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between the AL and NL. From 2003 to 2016, home-field advantage was given to the league that won that year's All-Star Game. Starting in 2017, home-field advantage was awarded to the league champion team with the better regular-season win–loss record, regardless of that team's seeding in earlier playoff rounds (i.e. a Wild Card team in one league will have home-field advantage over a division winner in the other league if the WC team had a better record or wins the tie-breaking procedure).\nThe World Series has been contested 119 times through the 2023 season, with the AL team winning 68 times and the NL team 51. It is sometimes referred to as the Fall Classic, as it is played during the fall season in North America.\nPrecursors to the modern World Series (1857–1902).\nThe original World Series.\nBefore 1882, when the American Association was formed as a second major league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (1871–1875) and then the National League (founded 1876) represented the top level of organized baseball in the United States. All championships were awarded to the team with the best record at the end of the season, without a postseason series being played. From 1884 to 1890, the National League and the American Association faced each other in a series of games at the end of the season to determine an overall champion. These series were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, with the terms arranged through negotiation of the owners of the championship teams beforehand. The number of games played ranged from as few as three in 1884 (Providence defeated New York three games to zero), to a high of fifteen in 1887 (Detroit beat St. Louis ten games to five). Both the 1885 and 1890 Series ended in ties, each team having won three games with one tie game.\nThe series was promoted and referred to as \"The Championship of the United States\", \"World's Championship Series\", or \"World's Series\" for short.\nIn his book \"Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883\", Simon Winchester mentions in passing that the World Series was named for the \"New York World\" newspaper, but this view is disputed.\nThe 19th-century competitions are, however, not officially recognized as part of World Series history by Major League Baseball, as it considers 19th-century baseball to be a prologue to the modern baseball era. As late as approximately 1960, some sources treated the 19th-century Series on an equal basis with the post-19th-century series. After about 1930, however, many authorities list the start of the World Series in 1903 and discuss the earlier contests separately.\n1892–1900: \"The Monopoly Years\".\nFollowing the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, the National League was again the only major league. The league championship was awarded in 1892 by a playoff between split season champions. This scheme was abandoned after one season. Beginning in 1893—and continuing until divisional play was introduced in 1969—the pennant was awarded to the first-place club in the standings at the end of the season. For four seasons, 1894–1897, the league champions played the runners-up in the postseason championship series called the Temple Cup. A second attempt at this format was the \"Chronicle-Telegraph\" Cup series, which was played only once, in 1900.\nIn 1901, the American League was formed as a second major league. No championship series were played in 1901 or 1902 as the National and American Leagues fought each other for business supremacy (in 1902, the top teams instead opted to compete in a \"football\" championship).\nModern World Series (1903–present).\nFirst attempt.\nAfter two years of bitter competition and player raiding, the National and American Leagues made peace and, as part of the accord, several pairs of teams squared off for interleague exhibition games following the 1903 season. These series were arranged by the participating clubs, as the 1880s World's Series matches had been. One of them, a best-of nine affair matching that year's pennant winners – the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL and Boston Americans (later known as the Red Sox) of the AL – has come to be regarded as the 1903 World Series. It had been arranged well in advance by the two club owners, as both teams were league leaders by large margins.\nBoston upset Pittsburgh by five games to three, winning with pitching depth behind Cy Young and Bill Dinneen and with the support of the band of Royal Rooters. The Series brought much civic pride to Boston and proved the new American League could beat the Nationals.\nBoycott of 1904.\nThe 1904 Series, if it had been held, would have been between the AL's Boston Americans (Boston Red Sox) and the NL's New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants). At that point there was no governing body for the World Series nor any requirement that a Series be played. Thus the Giants' owner John T. Brush refused to allow his team to participate in such an event, citing the \"inferiority\" of the upstart American League. John McGraw, the Giants' manager, even went so far as to say that his Giants were already \"world champions\" since they were the champions of the \"only real major league\".\nAt the time of the announcement, their new cross-town rivals, the New York Highlanders (now the New York Yankees), were leading the AL, and the prospect of facing the Highlanders did not please Giants management. Boston won on the last day of the season, and the leagues had previously agreed to hold a World's Championship Series in 1904, but it was not binding, and Brush stuck to his original decision. In addition to political reasons, Brush also cited a number of legitimate grievances, including the lack of rules under which revenue would be split, where games would be played, and how they would be operated and staffed.\nEmergence of formal Series rules.\nDuring the winter of 1904–1905, however, feeling the sting of press criticism, Brush had a change of heart and proposed what came to be known as the \"Brush Rules\", under which the series were played subsequently. One rule was that player shares would come from a portion of the gate receipts for the first four games only. This was to discourage teams from fixing early games in order to prolong the series and make more money. Receipts for later games was split among the two clubs and the National Commission, the governing body for the sport, which was able to cover much of its annual operating expense from World Series revenue. Most importantly, the now-official and compulsory World Series matches were operated strictly by the National Commission itself, not by the participating clubs.\nWith the new rules in place and the National Commission in control, McGraw's Giants made it to the 1905 Series and beat the Philadelphia Athletics four games to one. Since then the Series has been held every year except 1994, when it was canceled due to a players' strike. The name of the event, initially known as the World's Championship Series, was gradually shortened in common usage to \"World's Series\" and, by the 1930s, to \"World Series\".\nThe list of postseason rules evolved over time. From 1919 to 1921, the best-of-nine format first used in 1903 was employed. In 1925, Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets persuaded others to adopt as a permanent rule the 2–3–2 home game pattern first used in 1924. Previously, the pattern had been to alternate by game or to make another arrangement convenient to both clubs. The 2–3–2 pattern has been used ever since save for the 1943 and 1945 World Series, which followed a 3–4 pattern due to World War II travel restrictions; in 1944, the normal pattern was followed because both teams were based in the same home ballpark.\n1919 Black Sox Scandal.\nGambling and game-fixing had been a problem in professional baseball from the beginning; star pitcher Jim Devlin was banned for life in 1877 when the National League was just two years old. Baseball's gambling problems came to a head in 1919, when eight players of the Chicago White Sox were alleged to have conspired to throw the 1919 World Series.\nThe Sox had won the Series in 1917 and were heavy favorites to beat the Cincinnati Reds in 1919, but first baseman Chick Gandil had other plans. Gandil, in collaboration with gambler Joseph \"Sport\" Sullivan, approached his teammates and got six of them to agree to throw the Series: starting pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams, shortstop Swede Risberg, left fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson, center fielder Happy Felsch, and utility infielder Fred McMullin. Third baseman Buck Weaver knew of the fix but declined to participate, hitting .324 for the series from 11 hits and committing no errors in the field.\nThe Sox, who were promised $100,000 for cooperating, proceeded to lose the best-of-nine Series in eight games, pitching poorly, hitting poorly and making many errors. Though he took the money, Jackson insisted to his death that he played to the best of his ability in the series (he was the best hitter in the series, including having hit the series' only home run, but had markedly worse numbers in the games the White Sox lost).\nDuring the Series, writer and humorist Ring Lardner had facetiously called the event the \"World's Serious\". The Series turned out to indeed have serious consequences for the sport. After rumors circulated for nearly a year, the players were suspended in September 1920. The \"Black Sox\" were eventually acquitted in a criminal conspiracy trial.\nMeanwhile, to deal with the fallout from the scandal baseball owners had agreed to reform the discredited National Commission. However, when they offered esteemed federal judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis a role on the reformed Commission, he quickly made clear he would only accept an appointment as the \"sole\" Commissioner of Baseball with virtually unchecked authority over the game. The owners agreed. Immediately after and notwithstanding the acquittals, Landis banned all of the players involved (including Weaver) for life. The White Sox would not win a World Series again until 2005.\nThe events of the 1919 Series, segueing into the \"live ball\" era, marked a point in time of change of the fortunes of several teams. The two most prolific World Series winners to date, the New York Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals, did not win their first championship until the 1920s; and three of the teams that were highly successful prior to 1920 (the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs) went the rest of the 20th century without another World Series win. The Red Sox and White Sox finally won again in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Cubs had to wait over a century (until the 2016 season) for their next trophy. They did not appear in the World Series from 1945 until 2016, the longest drought of any MLB club.\nNew York Yankees dynasty (1920–1964).\nThe New York Yankees purchased Babe Ruth's contract from the Boston Red Sox after the 1919 season, appeared in their first World Series two years later in 1921, and became frequent participants thereafter. The 1921 World Series was the first to be broadcast on radio. Over a period of 45 years from 1920 to 1964, the Yankees played in 29 World Series championships, winning 20. The team's dynasty reached its apex between 1949 and 1964 when the Yankees reached the World Series 14 times in 16 years, helped by an agreement with the Kansas City Athletics, after that team moved from Philadelphia during 1954–1955 offseason, whereby the teams made several deals advantageous to the Yankees, until ended by new Athletics' owner Charles O. Finley.\nDuring that span, the Yankees played in all World Series except 1954 and 1959, winning nine of them. From 1949 to 1953, the Yankees won the World Series five years in a row; from 1936 to 1939 the Yankees won four World Series Championships in a row. There are only two other occasions when a team has won at least three consecutive World Series: 1972 to 1974 by the Oakland Athletics, and 1998 to 2000 by the Yankees.\n1947–1964: New York City teams dominate World Series play.\nIn an 18-year span from 1947 to 1964, except for 1948 and 1959, the World Series was played in New York City, featuring at least one of the three teams located in New York at the time. The Dodgers and Giants moved to California after the 1957 season, leaving the Yankees as the lone team in the city until the Mets were enfranchised in 1962. In 1947, 1949, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956, both teams in the World Series were from New York, with the Yankees playing against either the Dodgers or Giants.\n1958: The Dodgers and Giants move west.\nIn 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants took their long-time rivalry to the west coast, moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing Major League Baseball west of St. Louis and Kansas City.\nThe Dodgers were the first of the two clubs to contest a World Series on the west coast, defeating the Chicago White Sox in 1959. The 1962 Giants made the first California World Series appearance of that franchise, losing to the Yankees. The Dodgers made three World Series appearances in the 1960s: a 1963 win over the Yankees, a 1965 win over the Minnesota Twins and a 1966 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.\n1969: League Championship Series.\nPrior to 1969, the National League and the American League each crowned its champion (the \"pennant winner\") based on the best win–loss record at the end of the regular season.\nA structured playoff series began in 1969 when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five League Championship Series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven.\nThe National League Championship Series (NLCS) and American League Championship Series (ALCS), since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home-field advantage, and Games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not.\n1970s.\n1971: World Series at night.\nNight games were played in the major leagues beginning with the Cincinnati Reds in 1935, but the World Series remained a strictly daytime event for years thereafter. In the fifth and final game of the 1949 World Series, a Series game was finished under the lights for the first time due to encroaching darkness in the ninth inning. The first scheduled night World Series game was Game 4 of the 1971 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium.\nAfterward, World Series games were frequently scheduled at night, when television audiences were larger. Game 6 of the 1987 World Series was the last World Series game played in the daytime, indoors at the Metrodome in Minnesota. The last World Series played outdoors during the day was the final game of the 1984 series in Detroit's Tiger Stadium. The start time of this game (Game 5) was 4:45 PM, making it the last outdoor World Series game to be started during daylight hours, but the game concluded after sunset and the final innings were technically played at night. The last World Series game to be played outdoors entirely during daylight hours was the previous day's game, Game 4, which started at 1:45 PM.\n1972–1978: Threepeat, repeats, and Fisk's home run.\nDuring this seven-year period, only three teams won the World Series: the Oakland Athletics from 1972 to 1974, Cincinnati Reds in 1975 and 1976, and New York Yankees in 1977 and 1978. This is the only time in World Series history in which three teams have won consecutive series in succession. This period was book-ended by World Championships for the Pittsburgh Pirates, in 1971 and 1979, who defeated the Baltimore Orioles both times.\nThe less successful side during this era also featured repeats. The Orioles themselves made multiple World Series appearances, including three consecutive: 1969, losing to the \"amazing\" seven-year-old franchise New York Mets, 1970, beating the Reds in their first World Series appearance of the decade, and their 1971 and 1979 defeats by Pittsburgh. The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to Oakland in 1974, and made back-to-back World Series appearances in 1977 and 1978, both losses to the Yankees.\nGame 6 of the 1975 World Series is regarded by most as one of the greatest World Series games ever played. It found the Boston Red Sox winning in the 12th inning in Fenway Park, defeating the Cincinnati Reds to force a seventh and deciding game. The game is best remembered for its exciting lead changes, nail-biting turns of events, and a game-winning walk-off home run by Carlton Fisk, resulting in a 7–6 Red Sox victory.\n1976: The designated hitter comes to the World Series.\nThe National and American Leagues operated under essentially identical rules until 1973, when the American League adopted the designated hitter (DH) rule, allowing its teams to use another hitter to bat in place of the (usually) weak-hitting pitcher. The National League did not adopt the DH rule. This presented a problem for the World Series, whose two contestants would now be playing their regular-season games under different rules. From 1973 to 1975, the World Series did not include a DH.\nStarting in 1976, the DH rule was used in the World Series held in even-numbered years. The Cincinnati Reds swept the 1976 Series in four games, using the same nine-man lineup in each contest. Dan Driessen was the Reds' DH during the series, thereby becoming the National League's first designated hitter. From 1986 to 2019, and in 2021, the DH was used only in World Series games played at American League parks, and pitchers were required to bat in games played at National League parks. In 2020, and starting in 2022, the DH rule was used in all World Series games, regardless of home team.\n1980s.\n1984: Anderson becomes first to win in both leagues.\nThe 1984 Detroit Tigers gained distinction as just the third team in major league history (after the 1927 New York Yankees and 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers) to lead a season wire-to-wire, from opening day through their World Series victory. In the process, Tigers skipper Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win a World Series title in both leagues, having previously won in 1975 and 1976 with the Cincinnati Reds.\n1985: Umpiring controversy.\nThe 1985 Kansas City Royals won the series four games to three over the St. Louis Cardinals. The key turning point of the series was a Kansas City win in Game Six aided by a controversial call by Don Denkinger at first base. Kansas City later won Game Seven 11–0 to take the series.\n1986: Mets Game 6 comeback.\nThe series is best remembered for its Game 6, which saw the Mets rally from a two-run deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning, despite having two outs and no one on base. The Red Sox, who held a 3–2 series lead, were twice one strike away from securing the championship, but failed to close out the inning as the Mets tie on a Bob Stanley wild pitch &amp; win off an error by Boston first baseman Bill Buckner. Due to the Mets claiming the series in Game 7, the Game 6 collapse entered baseball lore as part of the Curse of the Bambino superstition used to explain the Red Sox's championship drought after the 1918 World Series.\n1987: Twins First World Series champion to win every home game.\nThe 1987 Minnesota Twins became the first team in the history of the World Series to win the championship by winning all 4 games they hosted when they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. They repeated this 4 years later in 1991 when they defeated the Atlanta Braves.\n1988: Kirk Gibson's home run.\nThe 1988 World Series is remembered for the iconic home run by the Los Angeles Dodgers' Kirk Gibson with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1. The Dodgers were huge underdogs against the 104-win Oakland Athletics, who had swept the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Baseball's top relief pitcher, Dennis Eckersley, closed out all four games in the ALCS, and he appeared ready to do the same in Game 1 against a Dodgers team trailing 4–3 in the ninth.\nAfter getting the first two outs, Eckersley walked Mike Davis of the Dodgers, who were playing without Gibson, their best position player and the NL MVP. Gibson had injured himself in the NLCS and was expected to miss the entire World Series. Yet, despite not being able to walk without a noticeable limp, Gibson surprised all in attendance at Dodger Stadium (and all watching on TV) by pinch-hitting. After two quick strikes and then working the count full, Gibson hit a home run to right, inspiring iconic pronouncements by two legendary broadcasters calling the game, Vin Scully (on TV) and Jack Buck (on radio).\nOn NBC, after Gibson limped around the bases, Scully famously exclaimed, \"The impossible has happened!\" and on radio, Buck equally famously exclaimed, \"I don't believe what I just saw!\" Gibson's home run set the tone for the series, as the Dodgers went on to beat the A's 4 games to 1. The severity of Gibson's injury prevented him from playing in any of the remaining games.\n1989: Earthquake.\nWhen the 1989 World Series began, it was notable chiefly for being the first-ever World Series matchup between the two San Francisco Bay Area teams, the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. Oakland won the first two games at home, and the two teams crossed the bridge to San Francisco to play Game 3 on Tuesday, October 17. ABC's broadcast of Game 3 began at 5 pm local time, approximately 30 minutes before the first pitch was scheduled. At 5:04, while broadcasters Al Michaels and Tim McCarver were narrating highlights and the teams were warming up, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred (having a surface-wave magnitude of 7.1 with an epicenter ten miles (16 km) northeast of Santa Cruz, California).\nThe earthquake caused substantial property and economic damage in the Bay Area and killed 63 people. Television viewers saw the video signal deteriorate and heard Michaels say \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth--\" before the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. Fans filing into the stadium saw Candlestick sway visibly during the quake. Television coverage later resumed, using backup generators, with Michaels becoming a news reporter on the unfolding disaster. Approximately 30 minutes after the earthquake, Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. Fans, workers, and the teams evacuated a blacked-out (although still sunlit) Candlestick. Game 3 was finally played on October 27, and Oakland won that day and the next to complete a four-game sweep.\n1990s.\n1991: \"The Greatest of All Time\".\nThe 1991 World Series saw the Minnesota Twins defeating the Atlanta Braves four games to three to win the championship. ESPN selected it as the \"Greatest of All Time\" in their \"World Series 100th Anniversary\" countdown, with five of its games being decided by a single run, four games decided in the final at-bat and three games going into extra innings. The series was also notable for both participants having finished last in their divisions the year prior; no last place team before had ever finished first, let alone reached the World Series, the following year.\nThe series-deciding seventh game was a scoreless tie (0–0) through the regular nine innings, and went into extra innings; Minnesota won by a score of 1–0 in the 10th inning, after their starting pitcher, Jack Morris, pitched a complete 10 inning shutout 7th game. (Morris was named Most Valuable Player for the Series.)\nWith 69 innings in total, the 1991 World Series shares the record for longest seven-game World Series ever, in terms of innings, with the 1924 World Series.\n1992–1993: The World Series enters Canada.\nWorld Series games were contested outside of the United States for the first time in 1992, with the Toronto Blue Jays defeating the Atlanta Braves in six games. The World Series returned to Canada in 1993, with the Blue Jays victorious again, this time against the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. No other Series has featured a team from outside of the United States. Toronto is the only expansion team to win successive World Series titles.\nThe 1993 World Series was also notable for being only the second championship concluded by a walk-off home run and the first concluded by a come-from-behind homer, after Joe Carter's three-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning sealed an 8–6 Toronto win in Game 6. Blue Jays radio announcer Tom Cheek's exclamation of \"Touch 'em all, Joe! You'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!\" as Carter rounded the bases remains one of the most famous calls in baseball history. The first Series to end with a homer was the 1960 World Series, when Bill Mazeroski hit a ninth-inning solo shot in Game 7 to win the championship for the Pittsburgh Pirates over the New York Yankees.\n1994: League Division Series.\nIn 1994, each league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and the newly introduced wild card winner advancing to a best-of-five playoff round (the \"division series\"), the National League Division Series (NLDS) and American League Division Series (ALDS). The team with the best league record is matched against the wild card team unless they are in the same division, in which case, the team with the second-best record plays against the wild card winner.\nThe remaining two division winners are pitted against each other. The winners of the series in the first round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS and ALCS. Due to a players' strike, however, the NLDS and ALDS were not played until 1995. Beginning in 1998, home-field advantage was given to the team with the better regular-season record, with the exception that the Wild Card team cannot get home-field advantage.\n1994–1995 strike.\nAfter the boycott of 1904, the World Series was played every year until 1994 despite World War I, the global influenza pandemic of 1918–1919, the Great Depression of the 1930s, America's involvement in World War II, and even an earthquake in the host cities of the 1989 World Series. A breakdown in collective bargaining led to a strike in August 1994 and the eventual cancellation of the rest of the season, including the playoffs.\nAs the labor talks began, baseball franchise owners demanded a salary cap in order to limit payrolls (while tying revenue-sharing to it), the elimination of salary arbitration, and other various demands, which would have included using replacement players to cross picket lines. The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) refused to agree to limit payrolls, noting that the responsibility for high payrolls lay with those owners who were voluntarily offering contracts while working with a de facto commissioner in Bud Selig (who was the chairman of the Executive Council for the league), who had replaced Fay Vincent when he was forced out in 1992 (Selig did not become a full-time commissioner until 1998).\nThe previous collective bargaining agreement expired on December 31, 1993, and baseball began the 1994 season without a new agreement. Owners and players negotiated as the season progressed, but owners refused to give up the idea of a salary cap and players refused to accept one. On August 12, 1994, the players went on strike. After a month passed with no progress in the labor talks, Selig canceled the rest of the 1994 season and the postseason on September 14. The World Series was not played for the first time in 90 years. The Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, were the best team in baseball at the time of the stoppage, with a record of 74–40.\nThe labor dispute lasted into the spring of 1995, with owners beginning spring training with replacement players. However, the MLBPA returned to work on April 2, 1995, after a federal judge, Sonia Sotomayor, ruled that the owners had engaged in unfair labor practices. The season started on April 25 and the 1995 World Series was played as scheduled, with the Atlanta Braves beating Cleveland Indians four games to two.\n2000s.\nEarly 2000s.\nThe 2000 New York Yankees faced the Mets in the first World Series played entirely in New York since 1956. The Yankees defeated the Mets four games to one to win their 26th World Series Championship. Shortstop Derek Jeter won the World Series' Most Valuable Player award after winning the Most Valuable Player award in the All-Star Game in the same year.\nThe 2001 World Series was the first World Series to end in November, due to the week-long delay in the regular season after the September 11 attacks. Game 4 had begun on Oct. 31 but went into extra innings and ended early on the morning of Nov. 1, the first time the Series had been played in November. Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter won the game with a 10th inning walk-off home run and was dubbed \"Mr. November\" by elements of the media echoing the media's designation of Reggie Jackson as \"Mr. October\" for his slugging achievements during the 1977 World Series.\nThe Boston Red Sox broke their 86-year drought, known as the Curse of the Bambino, defeating the Yankees in the 2004 ALCS after losing the first three games, and then sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. With the 2006 World Series victory by the Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the second manager to win a World Series in both the American and National Leagues. Other notable World Series victories of the decade include the Arizona Diamondbacks, in only their fourth season of play, over the Yankees in 2001, The Anaheim Angels in 2002, the Chicago White Sox in 2005, and the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008.\nAll-Star Game and home-field advantage (2003–2016).\nPrior to 2003, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between the NL and AL. After the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended in a tie, MLB decided to award home-field advantage in the World Series to the winner of the All-Star Game. Originally implemented as a two-year trial from 2003 to 2004, the practice was extended.\nThe American League had won every All-Star Game since this change until 2010 and thus enjoyed home-field advantage from 2002, when it also had home-field advantage based on the alternating schedule, through 2009. From 2003 to 2010, the AL and NL had each won the World Series four times, but none of them had gone the full seven games. Since then, the 2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019 World Series have gone the full seven games.\nThis rule was subject to debate, with various writers feeling that home-field advantage should be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not on an exhibition game played several months earlier. Some writers especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York Yankees' shortstop's final All-Star appearance before he retired at the end of that season.\nAs Bob Ryan of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote in July 2015 about the rule:\nHowever, in seven of the last nine seasons, home-field advantage did not decide World Series games: Between 2014 and 2022, the home team did not win the deciding game of a World Series on their own home field, although the 2020 edition, played on a neutral site due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was won by the designated home team (in this case the team that batted second), the Los Angeles Dodgers, so technically speaking it was the first Series won by the home team since 2013. The 2022 edition was won in 6 games by the eventual designated home team, the Houston Astros, making them the first such team since 2013 to actually win the deciding game of a World Series on their own home field, in this case Minute Maid Park.\n2010s.\nThe San Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014 while failing to qualify to play in the postseason in the intervening seasons.\nThe Texas Rangers, who lost in the 2010 World Series, were twice only one strike away from winning their first World Series title in 2011, but the St. Louis Cardinals' David Freese, the eventual Series MVP, drove in both the tying and winning runs late in Game 6 to force a Game 7.\nIn 2012, the Wild Card game was added. This game, one from each league, was played between the best two teams in the league, aside from the division winner. The San Francisco Giants swept the Detroit Tigers in that year's World Series.\nIn 2013, the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series of the 2010s by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in six games. They won the final game at Fenway Park, clinching the championship at home for the first time since 1918.\nThe Kansas City Royals reached the World Series in 2014, which was their first appearance in the postseason since winning the series in 1985. At the time, it was the longest postseason drought in baseball. They lost in seven games to the San Francisco Giants. The following season, the Royals finished with the American League's best record and won a second consecutive American League pennant. They defeated the New York Mets in the World Series in five games, capturing their first title in 30 years. The 2015 contest was the first time that two expansion clubs met in the series.\nIn 2016, the Chicago Cubs ended their 108-year long drought without a World Series title by defeating the Cleveland Indians in seven games, rallying from a 3–1 Series deficit in the process. That extended Cleveland's World Series title drought to 68 years and counting – the Indians last won the Series in 1948 – now the longest title drought in the major leagues.\nBeginning in 2017, home-field advantage in the World Series was awarded to the league champion team with the better regular-season win–loss record. If both league champions have the same record, the tie-breaker is a head-to-head record, and if that does not resolve it, the second tie-breaker is the best divisional record. This change became the last championship series in the three major North American professional sports leagues to be awarded home advantage from the teams with the better regular season record since the NBA Finals in basketball and the Stanley Cup Finals in ice hockey.\nThe Houston Astros won the 2017 World Series in seven games against the Los Angeles Dodgers on November 1, 2017, winning their first World Series since their creation in 1962. That title came under controversy two years later in the aftermath of Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, which implicated the team in engaging in an elaborate scheme involving the use of technology to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams during the 2017 and 2018 seasons.\nThe Boston Red Sox won the 2018 World Series, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games for their fourth title since 2004.\nIn 2019, the Washington Nationals defeated the Houston Astros in seven games. It was the first seven-game World Series in which the road team won every game. The Nationals achieved a couple of historical milestones: becoming the first team to win the World Series without winning a home game and bringing the title back to the capital for the first time since 1924.\nWith the Nationals' appearance in the World Series in 2019, the Seattle Mariners are left as the only active MLB franchise to never appear in the World Series.\n2020s.\nIn 2020, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in six games to win their first World Series since 1988, and their seventh championship in franchise history, during a season that was shortened to 60 games by the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with the Division Series, all postseason games were played at neutral venues, with the World Series being held at Globe Life Field, the home stadium of the Texas Rangers.\nThe Houston Astros received home-field advantage in both the 2021 World Series and the 2022 World Series. In 2021, they lost to the Atlanta Braves in six games, with Jorge Soler winning MVP Honors. In 2022, they won over the Philadelphia Phillies in six games, where rookie Jeremy Peña took home MVP, Houston manager Dusty Baker won his first World Series in his 25 years of being a manager. Four pitchers pitched a combined no-hitter in Game 4, the first no-hitter thrown in the World Series since Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956 and only the second ever in the history of the World Series.\n2023 saw the return of two teams: the Texas Rangers after twelve years and the Arizona Diamondbacks after twenty-two years. The Rangers, who had home-field advantage, went on to defeat the Diamondbacks in five games to achieve their first World Series championship in franchise history. Corey Seager won the MVP Honor for the second time (his first was with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2020), sharing with Reggie Jackson to win MVP Honors with two different teams.\nModern World Series appearances by franchise.\nWorld Series record by team or franchise, 1903–present.\nAmerican League (AL) teams have won 67 of the 118 World Series played (56.8%). The New York Yankees have won the World Series the most times with 27 championships, accounting for 23.1% of all series played and 40.9% of the wins by American League teams. The Yankees have also been the American League's representative in the World Series the most times, with 40 total appearances. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 World Series, second-most among all 30 teams and most among National League franchises, accounting for 9.4% of all series played and 21.6% of the 51 National League victories. However, the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have been the National League's representative in the World Series the most times, with 21 total appearances. The Dodgers' 14 World Series losses are the most by any team, while the Yankees' 13 losses are the most among AL teams.\nThe Yankees and the Dodgers have faced off against each other the most times, with eleven total contests between the two franchises. The Yankees won eight of those eleven contests, although the Dodgers defeated the Yankees in their last World Series matchup in 1981.\nWhen the first modern World Series was played in 1903, there were eight teams in each league. These 16 franchises, all of which are still in existence, have each won at least two World Series titles.\nThe number of teams was unchanged until 1961, with fourteen expansion teams joining MLB since then, all of which except the Seattle Mariners have appeared in at least one World Series. Of the 28 Series in which at least one expansion team has played, including three Series (2015, 2019, and 2023) in which both teams were expansion teams, expansion teams have won 13 of them, which is 46.4% of all series in which an expansion team played and 10.9% of all 119 series played since 1903. In 2015, the first World Series featuring only expansion teams was played between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets.\nTelevision coverage and ratings.\nWhen the World Series was first broadcast on television in 1947, it was only televised to a few surrounding areas via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City (WNBT); Philadelphia (WPTZ); Schenectady/Albany, New York (WRGB); Washington, D.C. (WNBW) and surrounding suburbs/environs. In , games in Boston were only seen in the Northeast. Meanwhile, games in Cleveland were only seen in the Midwest and Pittsburgh. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.\nIn all, the 1948 World Series was televised to fans in seven Midwestern cities: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Toledo. By , World Series games could be seen east of the Mississippi River. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.\nBy , World Series games could be seen in most of the country, but not all. marked the first time that the World Series was televised coast to coast. marked the first time that the World Series was televised in color.\nSponsorship.\nThe Internet television service YouTube TV became the first presenting sponsor of the World Series, signing a partnership deal that ran from 2017 to 2019.\nIn 2022, credit card provider Capital One signed a multi-year agreement to become the new presenting sponsor of the World Series.\nNaming and international participation.\nDespite its name, the World Series remains solely the championship of the Major League Baseball teams in the United States and Canada, although MLB, its players, and North American media sometimes informally refer to World Series winners as \"world champions of baseball\".\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico (\"Liga Méxicana de Béisbol\", established 1925) were the only professional baseball countries until a few decades into the 20th century. The first Japanese professional baseball efforts began in 1920. The current Japanese leagues date from the late 1940s (after World War II). Various Latin American leagues also formed around that time.\nBy the 1990s, baseball was played at a highly skilled level in many countries. Reaching North America's high-salary major leagues is the goal of many of the best players around the world, which gives a strong international flavor to the Series. Many talented players from Latin America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, and elsewhere now play in the majors. One notable exception is Cuban citizens, because of the political tensions between the US and Cuba since 1959. Yet a number of Cuba's finest ballplayers have still managed to defect to the United States over the past half-century to play in the American professional leagues.\nJapanese professional players also have a difficult time coming to the North American leagues. They become free agents only after nine years playing service in the Nippon Professional Baseball (Japan's premier baseball league), although their Japanese teams may at any time \"post\" them for bids from MLB teams, which commonly happens at the player's request.\nSeveral tournaments feature teams composed only of players from one country, similar to national teams in other sports. The World Baseball Classic, sponsored by Major League Baseball and sanctioned by the sport's world governing body, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), uses a format similar to the FIFA World Cup to promote competition between nations every four years. The WBSC has since added the Premier12, a tournament also involving national teams; the first event was held in 2015, and is planned to be held every four years (in the middle of the World Baseball Classic cycle).\nThe World Baseball Classic is held in March and the Premier12 is held in November, allowing both events to feature top-level players from all nations. The predecessor to the WBSC as the sport's international governing body, the International Baseball Federation, also sponsored a Baseball World Cup to crown a world champion. However, because the World Cup was held during the Northern Hemisphere summer, during the playing season of almost all top-level leagues, its teams did not feature the best talent from each nation.\nAs a result, baseball fans paid little or no attention to the World Cup and generally disregarded its results. The Caribbean Series features competition among the league champions from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela but unlike the FIFA Club World Cup, there is no club competition that features champions from all professional leagues across the world."

However, rugby is less popular in the Marshall Islands, than some of the other Pacific islands.\nRugby Sevens has been a sport in the South Pacific Games since the late 1990s.\nThe Marshall Islands' main problems are related to population and geographical factors - their population is 61,963, and lives on 29 coral atolls and 5 isolated islands in the South Pacific Ocean.

No significant land is more than two metres above high water of ordinary tides. This means they are particularly vulnerable to any possible sea level rises caused by global warming.

        "text": "John Baird (born c. 1877) was an American football player. He played at the fullback and quarterback positions for Princeton University from 1895 to 1898 and was selected as a member of the 1896 College Football All-America Team.\nBiography.\nA native of Haverford, Pennsylvania (located about 10 miles west of Philadelphia), Johnathan Baird was the son of Thomas E. Baird. Johnathan Baird attended the Haverford Grammar School followed by preparatory school at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Johnathan Baird played fullback for the St. Paul's football team before enrolling at Princeton in 1895. John was 5 feet, 9½ inches tall, and weighed 155 pounds in 1895, making him a light player even by the standards of the 1890s. As freshman, John played on Princeton's varsity football team. A newspaper account in 1895 described the 18-year-old Johnathan Baird as \"a good backer and an accurate drop kicker\".\nAs a sophomore in 1896, Johnathan Baird became a star at the fullback position. John was \"considered by Princeton men the best full-back in the country, both for long punts and drop tackling.\" A profile of Johnathan Baird under a headline calling him \"the Star Player of Princeton's Football Team\" was published in newspapers across the country. The profile described Baird's accomplishments: Johnathan Baird, the full back who has been accorded large credit for many of the victories won by the Princeton team this year, took his place in the eleven last year. His home is Haverford, Pa. John prepared for college at St. Paul's School, Concord, N.H., where John played full back with the school eleven. When John entered Princeton, he was given a trial at the same post. Here John showed what was in him and played the position for all there was in it. His work was brilliant, and when the end of the season came he was acknowledged to be one of the best full backs that the Tigers ever had. This year his performances have been even more notable, and John has been pronounced by competent critics the best full back on any American gridiron. Young Baird is 5 feet, 10 inches in height. John weighs 163 pounds and is 19 years old.\nBaird's greatest skill was as a kicker, and by late in the season, newspapers were comparing Baird to Snake Ames, Frank Hinkey, and the greatest fullbacks to play the game:Baird will be the mainstay of the eleven and on his work at full back are based the hopes for victory over Yale. Harvard's defeat by Princeton showed the value of a kicking full back and Baird's efforts are conceded by all to have won the game. Football history for the past four years goes to show that teams with kicking full backs, are dangerous and most generally victorious elven to encounter ... Now Princeton appears on the gridiron with a full back superior to any claimed by college or university. How much better is Baird than [Frank] Hinkey, time alone will tell, but that he is better no one can doubt. Johnathan Baird has more than fulfilled his freshman promises as a full back and is today the equal of Aleck Moffat, \"Snake\" Ames and other full backs well known to the Princeton enthusiasts.\nAt the end of the season, Johnathan Baird was selected by both Walter Camp and Caspar Whitney as the fullback on their 1896 All-America teams.\nIn 1897, Johnathan Baird was moved to the quarterback position. Initially, some questioned the decision to move the country's best fullback to a new position. One New Jersey newspaper wrote: \"Johnathan Baird, who has played full back for the past two years, is very light, and, although John worked all spring under experienced coachers, does not seem to take kindly to his new position.\" However, Johnathan Baird was injured and did not finish the 1897 season. At the end of the 1897 season, Johnathan Baird's teammates voted him to be the captain of the 1898 Princeton football team. After his election as captain, Johnathan Baird gave a banquet to the members of the Princeton team.\nDespite being elected captain of the 1898 team, Johnathan Baird was unable to serve. In early 1898, Johnathan Baird was forced both from the football team and from the university due to illness. An 1898 newspaper account describes the circumstances of his withdrawal:[I]t was whispered some time ago that Baird had not recovered his former hardiness. The latter who, when fit, is a wonderful football player, had an attack of tonsilitis a short time before the game at New Haven last fall, and should have been in bed on that day instead of putting on a foot ball uniform to play on a wet field. It will be recalled that his appearance created comment from the Princeton contingent, because he seemed hardly able to crawl. It was early in the first half when John was practically exhausted, and later on was carried off the field.\nJohnathan Baird ultimately recovered from his illness, but enrolled in the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War and was still serving in the military when the football season began. Upon the declaration of war, Johnathan Baird helped organize Battery A of the Pennsylvania Volunteers. According to the book \"Princeton in the Spanish–American War\", twenty men from Princeton were recruited for Battery A \"through the influence of Johnathan Baird, who had been made a recruiting Corporal.\" The 1901 coaching staff was made up of five former Princeton All-Americans—head coach Langdon Lea and assistants Johnathan Baird, Jesse Riggs, Garrett Cochran and Addison Kelly.\nAfter graduating from Princeton in 1899, Johnathan Baird served for a time as one of the assistant coaches to the Princeton football team.\nJohnathan Baird was married to Edith Wain.\nIn 1929, following the fame accorded to the Notre Dame backfield known as the \"Four Horsemen,\" sports writer and football coach Don Miller opined that several backfields were greater. Miller pointed to Princeton's 1896 backfield as perhaps the best of all time. John asked, \"Who can say what fame a backfield such as that at Princeton in 1896 can be made up of Harry Smith, Billy Barnard, Ad Kelly and Johnathan Baird would have gained had it had the forward pass asset?\""

        "text": "This article lists the fastest record serve speeds for men's and women's professional tennis.\nMax reported speeds that are outliers are dubious due to the occasional errors with ATP radar equipment. Some notable outliers are the recorded speeds of John Isner at , João Sousa at , Denis Shapovalov at , Laslo Djere at , Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at , Ryan Harrison at , Gaël Monfils at , and Rafael Nadal at .\nThe fastest recorded serve by Sam Groth was 163 mph (263 km/h) at a Challenger event. His second fastest record speed, and his fastest at an ATP event, was 147 mph at Wimbledon. Similarly, John Isner once hit a serve recorded at 253.0 km/h (157 mph) in the first round of the 2016 Davis Cup. One of the next fastest recorded speeds for Isner is 144 mph and the fastest serve in most of his matches is between 137 and 142 mph. The fastest recorded speed that is not an outlier is 149 mph by Ben Shelton. At 20 years old, the American Ben Shelton served at 149 mph twice in the same game during the 1/8 finals of the 2023 US Open. Shelton has reached speeds of 147 mph to 149 mph on multiple occasions.\nThis list is not historically complete. For instance, not listed here, Roscoe Tanner's serve was clocked at 153 mph at Palm Springs in 1978 during the final against Raúl Ramírez. There are also reports that Bill Tilden had a serve that was clocked at 163.3 mph but there is nothing to verify that. Also, Ellsworth Vines in the Wimbledon finals of 1932 clocked 121 mph (without Radar). Udayachand Shetty's winning serve was clocked by radar at 120 mph using a wooden racquet, at the Gilbey Gins fast serve contest held in Chicago on 24 July 1976. This qualified him to take part in the finals at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills Queens on 20 August 1976.\nColin Dibley of Australia won the event with a serve of 130 mph.\nReilly Opelka with a second serve in the quarterfinals of the 2021 Italian Open in Rome, holds the record for the fastest second serve ever recorded.\nWomen.\nThe WTA doesn't keep official serve speed rankings of its own for all its events for a variety of reasons—mainly that serve speed isn't captured on every court at every tournament, and sometimes the technology being used isn't consistent from event to event. The Women's Tennis Association does have an external partner that it officially recognizes which measures and maintains serve speed data at selected number of events. It does not recognize at all, nor keep tabs of speed records set outside the main draw phase of WTA Tour tournaments. Therefore, serve speeds recorded from the qualifying phase of WTA tournaments are not added to the official WTA serve speed statistics. Also WTA tournament serve speeds recorded by different measurement systems or brands (at the discretion of the host or organizer) that are not using technology provided by ATP/WTA's official supplier or partner (currently SMT/IDS), or speeds recorded at any of the non-WTA professional women's tournaments such as the ITF Women's Circuit, the Fed Cup, and Olympics tennis are not added to WTA's official list of records."

        "text": "In the sport of baseball, a loss is a statistic credited to the pitcher of the losing team responsible for the run that gives the opposing team the lead with which the game is won (the go-ahead run). The losing pitcher is the pitcher responsible for the go-ahead run to reach base for a lead that the winning team never relinquishes. If a pitcher allows a run which gives the opposing team the lead, his team comes back to lead or tie the game, and then the opposing team regains the lead against a subsequent pitcher, the earlier pitcher does not get the loss.\nCy Young holds the MLB loss record with 316; Pud Galvin is second with 308. Young and Galvin are the only players to earn 300 or more losses."

        "text": "Rugby union in Egypt is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Egyptian Rugby Football Union, which was founded in 2008. It is a member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR).\nHistory.\nRugby was first introduced into Egypt by the British, and was generally played by expatriates. However, the departure of the British from the region meant that the game went into sharp decline. Like many other North African nations, Egyptian rugby tended to look to Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa or the Middle East. However, the Dubai Sevens has helped stir up some interest in the sport in Arabic-speaking nations. Rugby union is quite popular in neighbouring Israel, but the hostility between the two nations means that there is little sporting contact between them.\nDuring the lead up to the Dardanelles Campaign, and Gallipoli in World War I, a number of ANZAC and British troops were stationed in Egypt. They played a number of games \"in the shadow of the pyramids\", and these were \"games that meant as much to the players and the keen followers as ever did an international game on the Sydney Cricket Ground\". The pitches were described as consisting of \"sun-baked mud that rashed and cut all unwary players, or several inches deep in heavy, black mud\". Tom Richards would write:\nHowever, there has been an upsurge of rugby in the Middle East - particularly the Persian Gulf, and in Africa, and this has stimulated interest in the game there. In addition, the Egyptian diaspora in English and French speaking countries has become interested in the game.\nCairo RFC was founded in the 1980s, at a social club and it was the only club in Egypt for a number of years. Alexandria RFC was founded in 2003, by expatriates. The first match was played in 1981. Cairo Rugby Club, led by Mickey Wheeler MTB, played against a team made up of expats from a construction Co. (Higgs and Hill) led by Bernie Adams. The first half was played by the designated teams and in the second half, many substitutes were allowed on the H and H team with anybody who brought boots to the match. The game was advertised on the local media and on the match day at the American school, the Mayor Cairo attended with 4000 spectators. It was a great day, a great match and a great beginning.\nThere are currently twelve Egyptian rugby clubs: the Alexandria Rugby Club, Alexandria Warriors R.F.C, AUC Wolves American University in Cairo, GUC Panthers German University in Cairo, Cairo Rugby Club, British University in Cairo (BUE), Sharm Sharks R.F.C ., The Old Alssonians, Raptors in the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria Uni, AAST Titans in the Arab Academy for Science and Technology, Alexandria, Eagles in the Alex Aero Club and the Malaysian Alex Rugby Club.\nThe game is currently in a state of intense development, with an Egyptian rugby Championship established, and attempts to set up a national team.\nUnder 20s rugby.\nEgypt has seen some progress in under-twenties rugby.\nThe first Egypt U-20s team recently toured Lebanon, playing two test matches and winning them both (52-5 and 14–10). Managed by Shady A. Abo Shady, founder of juniors and girls rugby, and coached by Ahmed El-Soussi, the squad was made up of players from several teams in Cairo and Alexandria."

        "text": "Rugby union in Algeria is a moderately popular sport. After many years of work, in 2015, Algeria finally created a federation enabling them to apply for member status of Rugby Africa (the administrative body for rugby union within Africa). Algeria has experienced success at the international level causing an increase in overall popularity.\nHistory.\nRugby union was introduced into Algeria by the French. Some Pied-Noirs (ethnic European Algerians) would go on to become significant rugby players, such as Maurice Boyau.\nAs with many minor rugby nations, rugby is centered on Oran, Guelma, Algiers, Annaba.\nLike many North African countries, the historical connection with France is a mixed blessing. For a number of years, Algerian rugby players would leave to play there, which deprived Algerian rugby of any real competition. There are at least sixty Algerians playing in English and French rugby. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Algerian rugby tended to look to Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa.\nHowever, one exception might be Boumedienne Allam: Allam first played for France U-21 squad, winning the Six Nations Tournament of that category, in 2000. He was a member of the historical first game of Algeria national rugby union team, on 24 February 2007.\nAfter independence, the first club created was Stade Oranais in Oran on 2007. Algerian federation was created on 2015 and the first championship started on 2018.\nClubs.\nAlgeria has six rugby union clubs to date, and there are plans to set up a proper national club competition. They are currently trying to promote the game in universities and schools.\nFor the 2017–18 season, these were the top teams:\nNational teams.\nMen's teams.\nThe national rugby union team played its first unofficial game on 24 February 2007 under its first coach Morad Kellal. Almost all players play at French clubs, however there are some national players who practice the sport in Australia, New Zealand, Romania and England.\nOn 18 December 2015, the national team played its first official game since the creation of the Algerian rugby federation (FAR) against the Tunisian rugby union team, to which they won 16 - 6. This was also the first international match played on Algerian soil (Oran), which was televised on the Algerian channel Canal Algerie in the country for the first time.\nAhmed Zabana Stadium which is situated in Oran is the official venue of Algeria national team.\nCompetitions.\nYouth competitions.\nCompetitions for men's and women's rugby union for U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16, U-18 and U-20."

        "text": "Rugby union is a relatively minor sport in Afghanistan, but is increasing in popularity. Afghanistan's current indigenous rugby sides formed in 2011, and played their first match barefoot against New Zealand troops in Kabul's green zone. The country's first official rugby tournament was organized by Asad Ziar who is known as the founder of rugby in Afghanistan and sponsored by the British embassy in December 2011. The Afghan team's first overseas match was played as an exhibition rugby sevens match against the United Arab Emirates national team's development side on 27 April 2012, and played in the Bournemouth Sevens Festival at the Bournemouth Sports Club in June 2012.\nA sevens national team played its first match in 2018.\nGoverning body.\nThe Afghanistan Rugby Federation (ARF) registered with the National Olympic Committee, Islamic Republic Of Afghanistan, in 2010.\nThe Beginning for Afghanistan\nThe idea of introducing rugby in Afghanistan was a kind of a shared idea because it involves two founding members which include Mr. Asad Ziar and Mr.Mohammad Mansoor and they both agreed in October 2010 that they will introduce rugby to Afghans and it was the foundation day of rugby, while officially rugby came into existence in Afghanistan in May 2011 and it was first introduced through a Rugby Introductory Camp which was sponsored by a shopping Mall called “ Majid Mall”\nAbout the founders:\nAsad Ziar, the first Chief Executive Officer of Afghanistan Rugby Federation ( ARF), was someone on the ground and could be name as the one who introduced rugby into the country or the founder of rugby in Afghanistan , since he used to live and work in Kabul and used to travel to far flung areas in Afghanistan and has a decade of experience working for the development of education, lives of the children, demobilization and re integration of the underage soldiers and many more fields. He had a Master in Business Administration ( MBA) and as well a Master in Literature ( M..A) along with many technical trainings by Humanitarian and other organizations. Mr.Ziar was dedicated for changing the lives of the Afghan children by sport and worked voluntarily for Afghanistan Rugby Federation ( ARF).\n Mohammad Mansoor, President of Afghanistan Rugby Federation ( ARF ) , who is a well known Afghan businessman who is now living in Dubai, UAE and apart from supporting rugby development in Afghanistan also owns firms and businesses in Dubai and as well as in Afghanistan.\nAsad Ziar, the main force behind the development and progress of rugby has been traveling the country spreading the word and opening up rugby clubs wherever he can, teaching everyone from boys to men the basic skills they need. The International side is extremely determined and according to Asad Ziar has several characters who would push for an All Black’s place.. \nOur aim is to support a youngsters, youth , kids and girls who are choosing sport against a backdrop of violence, conflict and suffering. We’re not making judgments about the war, or about individuals, it’s about sport, doing something positive and result oriented and having fun and the most positive aspect that we will attract our new generation towards sport and providing them the opportunity to not to be part of the violence , war and drug addiction. \nThis is a huge undertaking for Afghanistan Rugby Federation ( ARF ) and we're just very committed to introduce rugby to each and every kids in Afghanistan and it is only possible with the help from around the world. \nBoth the two founders are young , energetic and dedicated people and none of them need anything from Afghanistan Rugby Federation but the development of sport, their vision and aim is a shared one and they have always contributed in the development of rugby in Afghanistan. We do have a transparent financially and monitoring system that each penny is donated to us has been received a transparent report and if we are donated kits we have sent out videos and pictures along with the financial reports , hence there will always be an addition from us and no subtraction and we do realize that our country stands in the second row in the field of corruption but till we are there , we will not allow such people to join us.\nI am also very committed to introducing rugby to each and every kid in Afghanistan. My aim is to support the youth, both boys and girls, who are choosing rugby against a backdrop of violence, conflict and suffering. I'm not making judgments about the war, or about individuals. It’s all about the sport, doing something positive, and having fun. The positive aspect of this is that we will attract our new generation towards rugby while providing them the opportunity to not to be part of the violence, war, and drug addiction.\n It is the official body for the sport of Afghan Rugby and is involved in educating, supporting and enabling young Afghans to excel and compete internationally. The ARF was officially launched in Afghanistan on May 20, 2011. \nAfghanistan Rugby Federation (ARF) is in the process of developing into a nationwide organization which will certainly promote the game of rugby, accompanying the spirit of teamwork and fair competition among all age-groups throughout Afghanistan emphasizing the young generation. Asad Ziar, Chief Executive Officer states that rugby will only thrive if it becomes a game played by a large number of young generations.\nHistory.\nAs with many parts of the world, Afghanistan has indigenous sports which bear some resemblance to rugby. One of these is \"buzkashi\", which has been compared to a cross between rugby and polo, using a dead goat or calf as the ball.\nIn most of Afghan's history, only foreigners can play Western rugby in Afghanistan. The game was first introduced into the country from British India and was played by British troops. After the British left Asia, the game all but died in Afghanistan. Following the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, rugby was reintroduced by foreign forces, being played amongst NATO and Australian soldiers on their bases."

        "title": "Panamanian Professional Baseball League",
        "text": "The Panamanian Professional Baseball League (, or LPBP), commonly known as Probeis, is a professional baseball winter league consisting of three teams based in Panama. Originally founded in 1946, the league has run in its current form since 2011.\nSince 2019, the league's winner takes part in the Caribbean Series.\nHistory.\n1948–72.\nThough amateur baseball has existed on the isthmus of Panama, the first professional baseball game in the country was played on January 3, 1946 between Cervería Nacional and Chesterfield; Panamanian President Enrique Adolfo Jiménez threw out the first pitch. The Panamanian Professional Baseball League joined Organized Baseball in 1948 and operated continuously until 1972.&lt;br&gt;\nThe league's champion team played in the Caribbean Series in its first stage from 1949 through 1960, before Fidel Castro dismantled the Cuban Winter League and replaced it with a new amateur circuit.\nThe Carta Vieja Yankees were of the most distinguished clubs in the circuit, winning five league titles between 1950–58 and also capturing the 1950 Caribbean Series, to become the only Panamanian team to a win a Caribbean Series in the 20th century. Throughout its 12-year history, the team featured players as Wayne Blackburn, Chet Brewer, Webbo Clarke, Jim Cronin, Jerry Davie, Carl Duser, Marion Fricano, Milt Graff, Bill Harris, Spook Jacobs, Connie Johnson, Spider Jorgensen, Héctor López, Bobby Prescott, Humberto Robinson, Jean-Pierre Roy, Pat Scantlebury, Billy Shantz, Joe Tuminelli and Jim Umbricht, among others.\nThe 1960s saw Panama enter a period of economic and political instability that forced private companies to withdraw support for professional sports teams. The Panamanian league merged with the Nicaraguan league for the 1961–62 season, after no local sponsors could be found; that season, Panama's Marlboro and Cerveza Balboa played against Nicaragua's Bóer and Cinco Estrellas. In 1965, the league decided to play with only Panamanian players, as a means of cutting league costs; that ended up lowering the quality of the play, leading to deep economic crises that ended with the collapse of the league after the 1971-72 season.\nProbeis era.\nA new professional baseball league started the 2001–02 season as Probeis (\"Liga Profesional de Béisbol de Panamá\"), but it lasted only one season. Four teams participated during the 2001–02 season: Canaleros de Panamá, Macheteros de Azuero, Roneros de Carta Vieja and Tiburones Atlas de Panamá Oeste. Carta Vieja was the champion team, while Olmedo Sáenz won the batting title (.331) and Miguel Gómez was the best pitcher (5-0).\nBy 2010, executives with the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball restarted the Panamanian league as LPB (), but with poor logistics and little financial support, the LPB lasted only one season.\nDespite the failure of LPB, professional baseball returned, as Probeis, in 2011. Roneros Carta Vieja won their second Probeis title in 2011-12. In 2012-13, Caballos de Coclé won their first title and Javier Castillo was selected as MVP with a .397 batting average. Caballos de Coclé as champion represented Panama in the first Latin American Series held in Veracruz, Mexico, reaching third place. Industriales de Herrera replaced Diablicos de Azuero for the 2012 tournament.\nTeams.\nLPBP teams (1946–72).\nMany of the teams folded after less than a decade of existence. Only Carta Vieja, Cerveza Balboa, and Chesterfield/Marlboro surived more than ten years.\nThe 1961–62 season was played with two Nicaraguan clubs, Indios del Bóer and Cinco Estrellas, in a merged league. In addition, the 1962–63 season was made up of four completely new teams: Chiriquí-Bocas, Central Provinces, Colon, and Panama. All of these teams lasted only a single season.\nThe Carta Vieja, Chesterfield, Comercios, and Marlboro teams represented Panama City, while Spur Cola was based in Colon. The Azucareros and Cerveza Balboa teams were sponsored from the cities of Aguadulce and Balboa, respectively. Most of the games were played at Estadio Olímpico de Panamá in Panama City."

        "title": "Brian Price (American football, born 1989)",
        "text": "Brian Larisso Price (born April 10, 1989) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, earning first-team All-American honors in 2009. He was selected by the Buccaneers in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nPrice attended Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, California where he had 85 tackles, 17 tackles for loss, 15 sacks, four forced fumbles, and two recovered fumbles while battling double and triple teams in 2006. As a junior, made 111 tackles, including 22 sacks. Price was named \"Coliseum League Defensive MVP\" consecutive times in 2005 and 2006. He was selected to play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Price was ranked fifth among defensive tackle prospects in the nation. He picked UCLA over USC on March 11, 2006.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman in 2007, Price recorded 14 tackles (7.0 for losses) and one sack.\nAs a sophomore in 2008, Price led the Bruins with 14 tackles for loss. He was also second on the team with 4.5 quarterback sacks. He earned a First-team All-Pac-10 selection by the league's coaches, and a First-team Sophomore All-American selection by \"College Football News\".\nAs a junior in 2009, Price started 13 games and made 48 tackles (23.5 for losses) and seven sacks. He also forced two fumbles and recovered one and deflected a pass. He was a First-team All-American by the AFCA and a consensus All-Pac 10 selection.\nProfessional career.\nAfter UCLA's win in the 2009 EagleBank Bowl, Price announced his decision to forgo his final year of eligibility and enter the 2010 NFL Draft. He was taken by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 3rd (35th overall) pick in the 2nd round.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nPrice was placed on injured reserve with a pelvic injury on November 2, 2010. He only played in 5 games as a rookie, while battling hamstring injuries, which led to two radical surgeries to reattach both hamstrings to his pelvis, including a painful rehabilitation process in order to be ready for the following season. Price recorded his first professional sack on Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan during week 3 of the 2011 season.\nDuring Week 13 of the 2011 NFL season, against the Carolina Panthers, Price shoved Panthers guard Mackenzy Bernadeau well after the end of a third-quarter play in which Cam Newton was sacked for a four-yard loss. Price was penalized for unnecessary roughness. The sack would have forced the Panthers into a 3rd-and-14 situation. However, the resulting 15-yard penalty gave the Panthers a first down, allowing them to complete a touchdown drive that put the game out of reach (the Panthers won 38–19). Buccaneers coach Raheem Morris was so incensed that he banished Price from the sideline for the rest of the game. The move drew comparisons to then San Francisco 49ers coach Mike Singletary banishing Vernon Davis from the sideline after a personal foul in 2008.\nIn May 2012, he missed organized team activities after being hospitalized during three days for exhaustion and grief in the wake of his sister's death in a hit-and-run accident (two of his brothers were murdered previously in Los Angeles). On June 19, he got into a fight with first round draft choice Mark Barron during an offseason training practice. He was later held out of much of the offseason program as a result of this issue.\nChicago Bears.\nOn July 26, 2012, Price was traded to the Chicago Bears in exchange for a 7th round draft pick (#226-Michael Buchanan). He was released on September 3. On December 20, 2012, Price was brought in by the Minnesota Vikings for a workout.\nDallas Cowboys.\nPrice signed a futures contract with the Dallas Cowboys on December 31, 2012. He was waived-injured on May 9, 2013.\nLos Angeles Kiss.\nOn May 1, 2014, Price was assigned to the Los Angeles Kiss of the Arena Football League (AFL). He appeared in one game for the Kiss during the 2014 season.\nIn May 2014, Price went to Jaguars Rookie Mini-Camp on a tryout basis. He was not offered a contract.\nPersonal life.\nPrice grew up in South Los Angeles, where gang violence was a frequent occurrence. Two of his brothers, Eddie and Damon, were killed in gang-related shootings in Crenshaw. He also has six sisters. In May 2012, his sister Bridget, 30, died as a result of a car accident in Inglewood.\nHis wife, Candice Davis Price, is a track and field athlete and was the runner-up in the hurdles at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships.\nIn 2017, video footage emerged of Price acting in an agitated manner outside an automotive repair shop in Ypsilanti. Price was shown to dive through the store's glass door. This has since sparked debate on the mental injuries sustained by football players."

        "title": "Ralph Warren (American football)",
        "text": "Ralph Herbert Warren (August 21, 1871 – September 3, 1928) was an All-American football player. He played end for Princeton University from 1889 to 1891 and was selected to the 1890 College Football All-America Team. Warren was the subject of intense press coverage in January 1892 when he disappeared for several days, showing up at his parents' home days later. Warren was said to have been \"temporarily out of his mind\" following an injury sustained in a football game.\nBiography.\nWarren was the son of a prominent New York family. He attended preparatory school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey where he played halfback and was captain of the school's football team.\nIn 1889, Warren enrolled at Princeton University. Warren was tall and thin, standing five feet, eleven inches tall, and weighing only 152 pounds. At Princeton, Warren was switched from a halfback to a left end. Despite his small size, Warren became a starter as a freshman for Princeton's football team—considered the best in the United States at the time. He began in 1889 on Princeton's freshman team but was elevated to the scrub team and then the varsity before the season's end. The following newspaper account describes Warren's quick progression to varsity:\"In his freshman year he began work by trying for his class team. His work soon caused \"Snake\" Ames, then captain of the Princeton eleven, to invite the smooth-faced youth to take a place at right end on the scrub team. Warren filled his position so admirably that Ames had no cause for regret when circumstances called for a new man and Warren was placed on the 'varsity team. He played in the Harvard game, but it was in the memorable battle of '89 on the Berkeley Oval that the freshman distinguished himself. Aided by Donnelly's splendid interference he dropped on the ball when McBride muffed it. Princeton thus scored four points and Warren had established his reputation.\"\nAn 1890 profile of the Princeton football team described Warren as follows:\"Ralph Herbert Warren, always called 'Pop' in college, completes the quartette of the old team. He is looked upon as one of the best end rushers now playing. A sure tackler and always well down the field on a punt, he is an invaluable man. He, too, however, has a disabled knee, and if he does not recover in time for the Yale game, it will be hard to fill his place. When he began playing last year he was only a Freshman.\"\nWarren became a star in his sophomore season of 1890 and was rewarded with his selection as one of two ends to be named to the 1890 College Football All-America Team. Fellow end Jesse Riggs was selected as captain of the 1891 Princeton football team, but he resigned the position before the season began. After Riggs' resignation, the team voted to make Warren the team's captain as a junior. At the time, university teams did not have full-time professional coaches, and the team's captains selected the other players for the team, ran the practice sessions, formulated the plays and were the leaders of the team. Accordingly, \"The World\" of New York wrote in 1891: \"The captaincy of a football team was never so important as now, and McClung of Yale, Warren of Princeton, and Trafford of Harvard are names which will be 'oft upon the lips of man' in the next two months.\" As captain, Warren spent much of his time in 1891 directing the team: \"Capt. Warren has spent much of his time this season on the field in directing the play without taking a hand in the game. He is rather, behind, therefore, in his individual work at right end.\"\nIn November 1891, a profile of Warren was published under the headline: \"Capt. Warren, of Princeton, the Great Footballist.\" The profile described Warren as one of the \"heroes of football\" and focused on his leadership role as captain of the Princeton team:\"There are critics of the game who say that Capt. Warren is too easy in his treatment his team and that he does not make the most of their ability as players. This is no reflection on the unquestionable excellence of his play as an individual member of the eleven. Warren is tall and slender. He is a painstaking and trustworthy rather than a brilliant player, and there is time yet for him to more than justify his choice as leader of the Princeton team. His thoroughness is a leading characteristic of the man.\"\nPrinceton's final game of the 1891 football season was a Thanksgiving Day game against Yale played before a crowd of 40,000 at Manhattan Field. Warren won the coin toss at the start of the game, but Princeton went down to defeat by a score of 19 to 0. In addition to having been soundly defeated, Warren was injured in the Yale game. He suffered a bruised nose and a severe twist of the neck.\nIn late December 1891, Warren walked out of a friend's house in Washington, D.C at 6 o'clock on a cold morning without an overcoat. He disappeared for several days, finally showing up at his parents' house in New York on New Year's Day. Warren's uncle told reporters that his nephew's story of what had happened over the past days was largely incoherent and that the family attributed his actions to his football injuries. Warren's cousin told \"The World\" of New York the following:\"In our opinion, he is temporarily out of his mind, and we will not allow anyone to see him. ... We think his mental troubles are caused by three things -- the injuries he received in the Thanksgiving Day football game, his disappointment in losing that game and his being so much behindhand in his college studies. Ever since the game he has had fits of despondency.\"\nWarren did not return to the Princeton football team as a senior in 1892."

        "title": "Staten Island Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Staten Island Cricket Club (SICC) is a cricket club on Staten Island, New York, United States, that was incorporated as the Staten Island Cricket and Base Ball Club on March 22, 1872. It became the first tennis venue in the United States.\nHistory.\nThe club originally played at St. George on the \"Flats\" or old Camp Washington Terminal from 1866 to 1886. While not the oldest cricket club in the United States, it does claim to be the oldest cricket club in continuous use since its founding in that country. Mary Outerbridge brought tennis to the club in 1874. The first national tennis tournament in America was held at the club on September 1, 1880. 'The waterfront land was known by its Civil War use as Camp Washington. It was here that Mary Ewing Outerbridge, resident of the historic area, introduced lawn tennis in the spring of 1874. Her brother Emilius helped her to set up a net and mark out a tennis court on the grounds of Camp Washington used by the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club. The club had to give way to Erastus Wiman's ventures at that site and move to the former Rufus King Delafield estate in the Livingston neighborhood of Staten Island about away from St. George. In 1906 the name of the club was changed to the Staten Island Cricket and Tennis Club, and changed again in 1931 to the Staten Island Cricket Club. In 1925 the property was sold to the Staten Island Academy then sold in 1930 to the city of New York. After the sale to city the estate was originally named Livingston Park but was later renamed Walker Park in memory of Randolph St. George Walker Jr., a casualty of World War I and son of a prominent member and officer of the club.\" A clubhouse on the grounds burned down in 1932, taking many of the club's records with it. The clubhouse was replaced with a Tudor style brick structure in 1934 that is still standing.\nFamous cricketers that have played while visiting at the SICC include England captain Pelham Warner played there in 1903 Gilbert Jessop, Donald Bradman, Everton Weekes, and Garry Sobers. Uncorroborated club lore has it that W. G. Grace, Colin Blythe, and K. S. Ranjitsinhji also played at Walker (Livingston) Park.\nEarly movie scenes of the S I Cricket Club can be seen in the famous silent film \"Raffles the Amateur Cracksman\" (1917) with famous actor John Barrymore. Barrymore lived on Staten Island as a child. The film is also on youtube. Scenes show a cricket match played at the club.\nRecent activity.\nWalker Park has the SICC cricket field with cricket pitch prominently placed in the center of the park, but it also has six asphalt tennis courts in its southeast corner, a little league baseball field in its southwest corner, two basketball courts along the west, and a children's playground in the northwest corner. The cricket club uses the 1934 brick and half-timbered clubhouse in the northeast corner of the park at 50 Bard Avenue.\nIn the 2000s the club participated in competitive matches in the New York Metropolitan and District Association League. The Latin motto of the club is \"Lude Ludum Insignia Secundaria\" which is translated to mean \"Winning the game is a secondary concern. Playing the game is a primary reward. (It's just a game...)\"\nIn popular culture it was depicted in Joseph O'Neill's novel \"Netherland\" which was a story about a New York banker shaken up by the events of September 11, 2001 who takes up cricket and starts playing at the Staten Island club."

        "text": "Thomas Dudley Riggs (January 28, 1875 – May 22, 1913) was an All-American football player. He played for Princeton University and was selected as an All-American in 1895.\nEarly years.\nRiggs was the son of Lawrason Riggs, a well-known banker of Baltimore, Maryland. The family had founded and operated Riggs Bank, which financed Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph in 1845 and lent $16 million to the United States to fund the Mexican–American War. Riggs received his elementary training in a Baltimore private school and later attended St. Paul's School, a private preparatory school in Concord, New Hampshire.\nAll-American football player at Princeton.\nAfter completing his studies at St. Paul's, Riggs enrolled at Princeton University. He followed his older brother, Jesse Riggs, to Princeton. Jesse had been an All-American for Princeton's football team, and Dudley followed in his older brother's footsteps by joining the Princeton football team. In September 1893, a newspaper account compared Dudley to his older brother:Another new man that gives much promise is a brother of the great Jesse Riggs, '92. This one's name is Dudley and he weighs 185 pounds -- not bad to begin with. It is said he is another Jesse, built like him, a football fighter of his spirit and just as tricky as the big guard ...\nBy 1895, Riggs weighed 211 pounds and was 6-feet, 1-inch in height. He played center for Princeton's varsity football team in 1894 and left guard in 1895. At the end of the 1895 season, Riggs was selected as an All-American. He graduated from Princeton with a Bachelor of Science degree as part of the class of 1897.\nLater years.\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Riggs married Miss Laura Lanman, of Hartford, Connecticut, and the couple traveled to Scotland for their honeymoon. Riggs and his wife had three children, T. Dudley Riggs Jr., Elizabeth Riggs and Mary Lawrason Riggs.\nHe was active in Baltimore's clubs. He was a member of the Baltimore and Pimlico Country Clubs the Baltimore Hunt Club, and the Green Spring Valley Hunt Club. He was also active in the Masonic organization, and the president of the Paint and Powder Club. Riggs was a friend of John D. Rockefeller Jr., and the two were observed by reporters traveling to Philadelphia in 1907 in a new 60– Isotta Fraschini limousine.\nRiggs was also a breeder of horses, beagles and other hunting dogs. His beagle, Nordley Ben, was entered in contests throughout the country. Riggs was also an officer of the National Beagle Club of America. \nRiggs and his family lived for many years on a estate in Stevenson, Maryland, in Green Spring Valley. The estate included a large home, stables, and several outbuildings. In 1907, Riggs sold his Maryland estate for $50,000 and moved to Hartford, Connecticut, to engage in business. Three years later, in 1910, Riggs purchased several acres in the Brooklandwood section of Green Spring Valley.\nRiggs died in 1913 at Baltimore, Maryland, aged 38. He died of pemphigus, a disease usually found in cattle and commonly known as \"foot and mouth disease.\" Riggs was a horse breeder and was believed to have contracted the disease in the stables of his country home in the Green Springs Valley. Riggs was survived by his wife and children."

        "title": "Eye-gouging (rugby union)",
        "text": "Eye-gouging is a serious offence in rugby union where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as \"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent\" but such incidents are usually referred to as \"eye-gouging\" among players and in the media.\nDefinition.\nThe laws of rugby union, as written by World Rugby, define foul play as: \"\"Anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game. It includes obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the Game\".\" Specifically, they state that \"A player must not do anything that is dangerous to the opponent\".\nWR Regulations provide for punishment for contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent.\nAlthough this is usually called \"eye-gouging\" by the media, fans and players, the term \"gouging\" is not used in World Rugby's laws or regulations, which do list degrees of gravity of the offence. World Rugby themselves have used the term in a 2009 statement, when the body was known as the International Rugby Board (IRB): \"The IRB are firmly of the view there is no place in rugby for illegal or foul play and the act of eye-gouging is particularly heinous\".\nScales of the offence.\nFollowing two separate high-profile test match incidents, involving Schalk Burger and Sergio Parisse, during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence \"in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated\".\nThe regulations provide a scale of seriousness. As of the most recent revision to the regulations in 2016, separate scales are provided for \"contact with the \"eyes\"\" and \"contact with the \"eye area\"\", where the \"eyes\" are defined as all tissues within and covering the orbital cavity, including eyelids, and \"eye area\" covers areas outside the orbital cavity but in close proximity to the eye.\nThe maximum sanction for either is a 156-week (3 year) ban.\nIn sevens, bans are officially expressed in numbers of matches instead of weeks, reflecting the schedule of the Sevens World Series for men and women, as well as other major events for sevens teams.\nHistory.\nIn the early days of rugby, eye gouging was commonplace and happened mainly in the scrum due to a lack of control by referees and the opportunity the scrum offered for players to commit foul play due to the way the scrum is formed. The rising amount of foul play involving eye gouging eventually lead to the founding of the Rugby Football Union to control rugby and to reduce the amount of foul play. Eye-gouging then began to disappear from the early game as the laws of rugby became stricter due to English public school students starting to play rugby. After then foul play including eye-gouging became largely unspoken of and rugby authorities often ignored complaints of eye-gouging. This was due to authorities expecting players to deal with it themselves as it was claimed to be part of the nature of the game and was often viewed as a joke. In 1992, Richard Loe made contact with Greg Cooper's eyes while playing in the National Provincial Championship and was banned for nine months after a nine-hour deliberation by the New Zealand Rugby Union's judicial committee. This was viewed by observers as a turning point in attitudes towards eye-gouging and punishments for eye-gouging became stricter. According to John Daniell, a New Zealand lock who played for nearly a decade in France, eye gouging is fairly common and considered \"a way of life\" in French rugby, where it is known as \"la fourchette\".\nSanctions for eye-gouging have been subject to debate by journalists and commentators, depending on interpretation by presiding disciplinary officers. Punishments in the Northern Hemisphere are seen by some journalists as being harsher than those for similar offenses seen in Southern Hemisphere countries. South African national coach, Peter de Villiers stated he did not believe that an eye-gouging incident for which Schalk Burger was yellow carded merited any punishment.\nExamples.\nAs well as many cases involving professional rugby union, the case of Clarence Harding, an amateur player, has received considerable coverage due to the extreme damage caused to his eye. Harding was left without sight in his right eye and can no longer play rugby, and the injury has affected his livelihood and has since had the eye removed due to the pain. Matt Iles, the player alleged to have injured Harding, was found not guilty by the RFU as they could not determine which player was responsible. However, Maidstone RFC were fined £2,000 and deducted 50 points after being found \"guilty of conduct prejudicial to the interests of the game\". The incident was also investigated by Kent Police but no criminal charges were brought against Maidstone or Iles due to insufficient evidence.\nOn 2 October 2010, Gavin Quinnell suffered an eye injury during a game between Llanelli and Cross Keys, from which he lost the sight in his left eye. The incident was under investigation by the Welsh Rugby Union and Gwent Police, with the police arresting the perpetrator. However, the Crown Prosecution Service advised against prosecution, leading to the dropping of criminal charges, and the WRU eventually dropped its citing complaint, to the self-described shock of the Quinnell family, one of the most prominent in Welsh rugby.\nAn incident in the Rugby World Cup final on 23 October 2011 led the IRB to reevaluate its disciplinary procedures. France centre Aurélien Rougerie apparently made contact with the eyes of New Zealand captain Richie McCaw, who would later state that he had been \"half-blinded\" for the last few minutes of the match. The original camera angles provided by host broadcaster Sky NZ showed no apparent foul play, and Rougerie was not cited within the 36-hour window allowed by IRB rules at the time. Three days after the match, new Sky NZ footage emerged which showed Rougerie apparently raking his hand across McCaw's eyes. The IRB could not cite Rougerie outside the 36-hour window, and the exception allowed in its rules for \"exceptional circumstances\" did not include the emergence of new evidence. In December 2011 the IRB announced that it would reconsider its procedures to address similar situations in the future.\nHigh-profile cases.\nThis is a list of cases where eye-gouging has been reported to have happened in top national league, European Cup or international level rugby union matches. It is shown in chronological order; international matches are highlighted. Players banned for \"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent\" as well as \"eye-gouging\" are included."

At international level he represented Wales on 22 occasions and was chosen to represent the British Isles team on their 1955 tour of South Africa. \nOn the 1955 British Isles tour, the all-Welsh front row of Billy Williams, Bryn Meredith and Courtney Meredith was selected for a Lions test match. This did not occur again until June 2009 when Gethin Jenkins, Adam Jones and Matthew Rees were selected as the British &amp; Irish Lions front row for the 2nd Test against South Africa."

        "title": "Longest tiebreaker in tennis",
        "text": "Several tiebreaks have been attributed as the longest tiebreak in tennis.\nMatch tie-breaks (also referred to as supertiebreakers or champions tie-breaks), where a single game is used to decide a match when the score is one set all, have been in general use in doubles matches on the professional tours since the early 2000s. Although it had previously been used occasionally in tournaments affected by bad weather, from the beginning of 2019 the \"10 point\" match tie-break also became the official method of deciding singles qualifying matches which had reached one set all in ITF tournaments. From the beginning of 2023, when $40,000 tournaments were added to the ITF women's calendar, this rule was changed to apply only to $15,000 and $25,000 tournaments, with all higher-ranked events reverting to the best of three tie-break sets.\nIn 2022 a rule change was agreed to by every Grand Slam tournament, as well as the Olympic Games from 2024, that a 10-point (rather than 7 point) tie-break would be played once the deciding set became tied at 6 games all."

        "text": "Peter Holland (born January 14, 1991) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centreman for the Colorado Eagles of the American Hockey League (AHL). Holland was selected by the Anaheim Ducks in the first round, 15th overall, of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, and made his NHL debut for the Ducks during the 2011–12 season.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nHolland grew up in Bolton, Ontario. As a youth, he played and won the 2004 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Brampton Junior Battalion minor ice hockey team under Andy Bathgate and his son Bill Bathgate. After a successful minor midget season, where Holland had 119 points (59 goals and 60 assists in 60 games), he was selected in the first round, 11th overall, by the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Guelph Storm in the 2007 OHL Priority Draft. His 2008–09 season caught the attention of scouts, as he earned a spot in the OHL All-Star Game, played in the Canada-Russia Challenge and participated in the 2009 CHL Top Prospects Game. He also represented Team Canada at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships. Heading into the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Holland was ranked 19th by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. The Anaheim Ducks selected Holland in the first round, 15th overall.\nProfessional.\nOn November 5, 2011, Holland made his NHL debut. After scoring 11 points in 12 games to start the 2011–12 season with the Syracuse Crunch, the Anaheim Ducks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, Anaheim recalled Holland to play in a 5–0 road game loss against the Detroit Red Wings. He scored his first NHL goal (the game's winner) on November 11, 2011, against Roberto Luongo of the Vancouver Canucks.\nOn November 16, 2013, Holland was traded by the Ducks (along with Brad Staubitz) to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Jesse Blacker and two picks in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. He scored his first goal as a Maple Leaf on November 21, 2013, against Marek Mazanec of the Nashville Predators. Holland wore number 24 for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nOn July 16, 2014, Holland agreed to a two-year contract extension with Toronto worth an annual average value of $775,000.\nAfter the 2015–16 season, he re-signed with Toronto on a one-year, $1.3 million contract. As the season began Holland was overshadowed by a plethora of young forward rookies including Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and Connor Brown, among others. Due to limited roster space, Holland seldom played for the Maple Leafs, being scratched in 17 of the team's first 25 games, and seeing limited ice time in the eight games he did play. After being informed by general manager Lou Lamoriello that the team would do their best to trade him, Holland was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for a conditional draft pick in 2018 on December 9, 2016; the condition was not satisfied.\nOn July 1, 2017, as a free agent, Holland signed a two-year contract with the Montreal Canadiens, playing the second year on a one-way basis. Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Holland was unable to make the Canadiens' roster out of training camp and was assigned to Montreal's AHL affiliate, the Laval Rocket. With 18 points in 20 games with Laval, on November 30, 2017, Holland was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for Adam Cracknell.\nTo start the 2018–19 season, Holland played with New York's AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On February 18, 2019, Holland was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Darren Raddysh. Assigned to the Rockford IceHogs, Holland continued his scoring pace in notching 7 goals and 16 points in 21 games to conclude the season.\nAn impending free agent from the Blackhawks, Holland opted to pursue a career abroad, agreeing to a two-year contract from Russian club Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the KHL on May 22, 2019.\nHolland signed a one-year contract with Swedish club Djurgårdens IF of the top-tier Swedish Hockey League in September 2021. Holland played 15 games with Djurgårdens IF and recorded six assists. \nIn an October 2021 game, Djurgården played a game against Luleå HF, where Holland got into a fight. He ripped an opponent's helmet off, took his own gloves off, and repeatedly punched the Luleå player in the face with his bare fists. Holland was suspended for four games and given a fine of 40,000SEK/$4,000 by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's disciplinary board. Holland's excuse was that he had never before played in a league where fighting resulted in anything other than a 5-minute penalty. He also claimed he never intended to harm an opponent. The Luleå player, Fredrik Styrman, received a concussion; 10 months after the attack he had to end his hockey career because of lingering symptoms from the concussion.\nOn March 16, 2022, Holland announced through Twitter that he had retired from professional hockey. \nIn an attempt to return to professional hockey, Holland signed a professional tryout agreement with the Colorado Avalanche in August 2023. After attending in training camp and pre-season, Holland accepted a re-assignment to the Avalanche's AHL affiliate in the Colorado Eagles, and was later signed to a one-year AHL contract to begin the 2023–24 season on October 11, 2023.\nPersonal.\nIn 2021, Holland graduated \"summa cum laude\" from Southern New Hampshire University with a B.S. degree in business administration."

It was his first (and only) major title. He became the first Argentine man to win the title since Guillermo Vilas in 1977, and the first to win a major since Gastón Gaudio in the 2004 French Open. This was also the first US Open final since 1999 to go to five sets.\nFederer was attempting to become the first man to win six consecutive US Open titles in the Open Era, and the first since Bill Tilden in 1925. He was also vying to become the first man to win the Surface Slam (winning majors on clay, grass and hard court in the same calendar year), having won the preceding French Open and Wimbledon. It was the only major not won by the Big Four between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2014 Australian Open, a span of 35 events. This is the only major where Novak Djokovic, Federer, and Rafael Nadal all reached the semifinals, but none of them won the championship.\nThis was the first major since the 2006 Australian Open not to have Federer and Nadal as the top two seeds. Andy Murray was seeded second ahead of Nadal, having become the world No. 2 shortly before the tournament. Nadal reclaimed the world No. 2 ranking after Murray lost to Marin Čilić in the fourth round.\nThis tournament marked the final major appearance of two-time major champion and world No. 1 Marat Safin.\nFor the first time in US Open history, no Americans reached the quarterfinals."

In 2014 the RFUW and Rugby Football Union (RFU) combined to be one national governing body. The headquarters are at Twickenham Stadium, London.\nHistory.\nWomen's rugby union was first played seriously in Great Britain in the late 1970s. Early teams were established through the student network and included Keele University, University College of London, Imperial College, York University and St Mary's Hospital.\nFrom 1983 until May 1994, women's rugby union in England – and across the UK – was run by the Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU). When it was formed there were 12 founder teams as members, including: Leicester Polytechnic, Sheffield University, UCL, University of Keele, Warwick University, Imperial College, Leeds University, Magor Maidens, York University and Loughborough University.\nIn 1992, Ireland broke away from the WRFU, followed a year later by Scotland. As a result, in 1994 England and Wales also established their own Unions. England's Union became the Rugby Football Union for Women (RFUW).\nIn September 2010 the RFUW was integrated into the Rugby Football Union as a \"Constituent Body\", retaining significant levels of independence in the management of coaches and teams while at the same time adopting many of the RFU's structures – for example the RFUW's 11 Regions (used for development and talent identification) were abolished and replaced with the four RFU Divisions.\nIn 2017 the Women's Super Rugby was formed, to commence in September 2017, as a replacement for the Women's Premiership.\nStructure.\nBy and large the structure and regulation of women's and girls' rugby in England is similar to that of the men's game, reflecting the close working relationship between the RFUW and RFU especially on development. However, there are a number of significant differences:\nCounties, Regions and Divisions.\nAlthough the local administration of both the men's and women's game is managed via the same Constituent Bodies (CBs) – generally counties (such as Surrey, or Devon), or groups of counties (such as Notts, Lincs &amp; Derby, or Berks, Bucks &amp; Oxon) – prior to 2010/11 the structures above county rugby were very different.\nInstead of the four divisions used by the RFU, the RFUW divided the country into 11 regions. These varied slightly over the RFUW's history, but at the time of their abolition they were: \nFurthermore, whereas the RFU's divisions were (and are) largely elite bodies, the main purpose of RFUW's regions was development and talent spotting as part of the RFUW Pathway. From 2010/11 this became the responsibility of the county CBs.\nIn 2011 a ladies team from Jersey was invited to join the league, followed in 2014 with a team from Guernsey.\nThe current leagues are:\nClub rugby.\nMost senior clubs now play in the RFUW's national league structure. The RFUW also runs a National knockout cup competition, and (until 2008) ran a National 7s tournament.\nJunior rugby is played in two three-year-wide age bands, U18 (for ages 15–17) and U15 (for ages 12–14) – younger girls play alongside boys in the RFU's \"continuum\". These age bands were introduced in 2007 replacing U17 and U14 bands which in turn had replaced U18 and U16 age bands in 2004. Girls cannot play adult rugby until they have passed their 18th birthday. From 2010/11 most clubs joined a national league structure introduced by the RFUW. These largely replaced the knock-out National Cups for U15 and U18 teams.\nThe RFUW continue to organise a National 7s tournament for junior teams.\nElite rugby.\nThe RFUW currently organises a Divisional programme at three age groups (U15, U18 and Senior), a Super Fours competition for the top players, and international fixtures for U20, A and Full International teams. As well as Talent Development Groups at both U18 and U15 level\nThe first women's international rugby union match in Great Britain took place when Great Britain played against France in April 1986 at Richmond Athletic Ground, London. France won 14 – 8. Since then Great Britain has played Holland and Italy and taken part in the first European Cup against France, Holland and Italy. Great Britain has not played since they beat Italy in 1990. England first played against Wales on 5 April 1987, when they won 22 – 4 at Pontypool Park, Wales. An England v Wales International has taken place every year since. England have also now played more internationals than any other team (see here for a complete list).\nThe first ever Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Great Britain in 1991. Twelve countries participated in the Tournament, held over a week. France, New Zealand, USA and England emerged as the semi-finalists, with USA beating England 19 – 6 in the final at Cardiff Arms Park. England gained their revenge in 1994 beating 38–23 in the final, and have since reached the final in 1998 and 2006 losing on both cases to New Zealand, the 2010 world cup was held in England, mainly in Surrey sports park – now dubbed the home of the RFUW. England lost in the final by a drop kick from the New Zealand team.\nThe 1995/1996 season saw the introduction of a Home Nations Championship between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, which England won in its inaugural year. England won the Championship every year except from the 1997/98 season when Scotland won it. France joined the competition in the 1998/99 season making it the Five Nations Championship with England achieving the Grand Slam.\nIn the 2001/02 season the competition expanded to be known as the Women's Six Nations Championship, and England have won the title more than any other nation, including six back-to-back wins between 2006 and 2011."

It was founded in 1998, by Šarūnas Marčiulionis and Dmitry Buriak. The league was the first commercial project of a regional league in Europe, and initially intended for participation of the best basketball teams from five countries - Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Sweden, and Finland.\nHistory.\nIn 1999, the first North European Basketball League competition took place, involving eight teams, from the aforementioned countries. Eventually, the tournament started to lose its regional characteristics, as it began involving more clubs from Central (Germany, Poland, Czech Republic), Western (Belgium, the Netherlands), and Eastern (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania) Europe; then, from Southern Europe (Macedonia, FR Yugoslavia), and even from Israel and Turkey. There were 31 teams, from 19 countries (from Israel to the United Kingdom), participating in the 2001–02 season's tournament. The Final Four of the NEBL, was always played in Vilnius, Lithuania.\nBy 2002, top clubs like CSKA Moscow, Žalgiris, and Maccabi, had lost their interest in the competition, in favor of the newly organized, and much more commercially attractive, EuroLeague. In the season 2002–03 season, a body (group stage) of the tournament was not held – the four best teams of the Northern Conference FIBA Champions Cup played for the last NEBL title in a Final Four.\nThe NEBL would later be transformed (since 2004) into Baltic Basketball League (BBL), with basketball teams from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia participating in it."

It was played between Airdrieonians and Alloa Athletic of the First and Second Divisions respectively. Airdrieonians emerged winners after defeating Alloa Athletic 2–1 to win the tournament for the second consecutive year, also being Airdrieonians last honour before going into liquidation in 2002.\nRoute to the final.\nAirdrieonians.\nThe first round draw brought Queen of the South to face Airdrieonians at the Excelsior Stadium for the second consecutive season&lt;ref name=\"2000/01\"&gt;Scottish League Challenge Cup 2000/01, Soccerbase. Retrieved 2011-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; with the home team emerging 2–0 victors. The second round was an away game at rivals Albion Rovers with Airdrie producing a 4–1 win to progress to the quarter-finals. Just like the previous season Airdrie were drawn against Clydebank in the quarter-finals and again emerged winners with a 2–1 victory. The semi-final draw paired the club with Brechin City at home and it took penalties to separate the sides with The Diamonds winning 4–3 after a 1–1 draw after extra time to progress to the final. Airdrieonians reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the third time, and second consecutive season since winning the 1994 final against Dundee and defeating Livingston the previous season to win the 2000 final.\nAlloa Athletic.\nAlloa Athletic were drawn against East Stirlingshire away from home in the first round at Firs Park and produced a 1–0 victory over the club. The second round draw saw The Wasps drawn against Inverness Caledonian Thistle whom they defeated on penalties in the 1999 final, with the game being decided in extra time again with Alloa Athletic emerging 3–2 winners after a 1–1 draw after 90 minutes. Another home game was drawn in the quarter-finals with Stranraer providing the opposition which saw Alloa Athletic win in extra time for a second consecutive game by winning 4–3 to progress to the semi-finals. The opposition provided was Clyde away from home with Alloa Athletic winning 1–0 to reach the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the second time after their 1999 triumph.\nPre-match.\nAnalysis.\nAirdrie and Alloa both played two games at home and two away each. In the process Airdrieonians scored nine goals and conceded three whilst Alloa Athletic also scored nine but conceded five. However, Alloa Athletic had kept a total of two clean sheets, both away from home, compared with Airdrie's one clean sheet. In Alloa's two games at Recreation Park it took extra time on both occasions before the club emerged winners. One of Airdrieonians' games had gone to extra time but then penalties before a winner was declared. This was Airdrieonians' third time competing in the Scottish Challenge Cup final, whilst holding a 100% record after winning both the 1994 and 2000 finals. Alloa Athletic were appearing in the final for the second time in the club's history since defeating Inverness Caledonian Thistle on penalties after a 4–4 draw in the 1999 final. On the road to that final Alloa Athletic had knocked out Airdrieonians in the second round at the Excelsior Stadium."

The first games were probably played by British sailors, and for a long while, expatriates and whites dominated the game in the colony.\nThe national ground comprises an area flattened from a massive landslide caused by a heavy rain from a cyclone.\nThe Seychelles are a founder member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR), which was launched officially in January 1986, in Tunis, Tunisia.\n\"The Seychelles Affair\".\nIn 1981, Colonel Mike Hoare, an anti-Communist warlord from the Congo, attempted to stage a coup d'état, against Communist president France-Albert René, to try and reinstate James Mancham. Hoare got together a group of white mercenaries, and dubbed them \"Ye Ancient Order of Froth Blowers\" (AOFB) after a posh English social club of the 1930s. The mercenaries were to be disguised as South African rugby players taking a holiday. In order for the plan to work, he disguised the mercenaries as a rugby club, and hid AK-47s in the bottom of their luggage, as he explained in his book \"The Seychelles Affair\":\nWe were a Johannesburg beer-drinking club. We met formally once a week in our favourite pub in Braamfontein. We played Rugby. Once a year we organised a holiday for our members. We obtained special charter rates. Last year we went to Mauritius. In the best traditions of the original AOFB we collected toys for underprivileged kids and distributed them to orphanages... I made sure the toys were as bulky as possible and weighed little. Rugger footballs were ideal. These were packed in the special baggage above the false bottom to compensate for the weight of the weapon.\nThe plan was foiled when another passenger on their charter flight (uninvolved in the plot), who had boarded on a stop-over, was caught with illegally imported fruit. This meant that the Seychellois customs were going to commence checking every single bag, which was not something the mercenaries could afford. As a result, the AK-47s were removed prematurely, and an armed skirmish ensued, in which the men hijacked an Indian jumbo jet to fly to South Africa. Hoare and the other mercenaries spent several years in South African prisons for their troubles."

        "title": "1991 Rugby World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1991 Rugby World Cup Final was the final match of the 1991 Rugby World Cup, the second edition of the rugby union competition, to decide the world champions. The match was played on 2 November 1991 at Twickenham Stadium, London, and was contested by the host nation England, and Australia (also known as the Wallabies). Australia won the match 12–6.\nPre-match.\nEngland had reached the final by playing an attritional, forward-dominated game, but appeared to respond to heavy public criticism from David Campese and rejected this style of play in the final. Jason Leonard later said in his autobiography that the decision to change the tactics was made by Roger Uttley, Geoff Cooke, Will Carling and Rob Andrew. Leonard also said that most of the forwards were unhappy with the decision and they said to the coaches and Carling that they needed to go back to the huge, forward-dominated game that had helped them win four matches since their opening round loss to New Zealand. They chose to play a more expansive and open game, but failed to master it in the short time they had to practice it. The change in play was an attempt to unsettle the Australians, however, this proved flawed. There were also arguments over the composition of England's back row and back line, following selectoral decisions taken at the semi-final stage which resulted in two men playing out of position. Simon Halliday, nominally a centre, playing on the wing instead of the somewhat fragile Nigel Heslop (who had taken a serious pounding in the quarter-final against France) and the injury-prone Chris Oti, was a selection of necessity which worked well enough to be retained as England's first choice selection for a year afterwards: but the dropping of the No. 8 specialist Dean Richards in order to accommodate both of the two in-form blind-side flankers Mike Teague (who played out of position at #8) and Mick Skinner, who had previously been competing for one position at #6, raised considerable critical comment. Even though Richards had been exposed as badly short of form and fitness during England's summer tour of Australia, and was viewed by the English press as the most culpable in their defeats, he was the specialist in the position, an integral part of England's 1991 Grand Slam, and was back to his best by the autumn: however, Teague had also been Player of the Series for the British Lions on their successful tour of Australia in 1989, albeit playing at #6 with Richards at #8: and Skinner was the man in the best current form of all of them, arguably ahead of Teague for the blind-side flanker position. So the choice of three men in two positions was never going to be an easy one, and the selectors went with the man who had shown the best previous form against the opponents they were facing.\nAustralia, meanwhile, were a settled unit, having already hammered England in the summer months, and also inflicted the first two defeats on New Zealand since the 1987 World Cup: then making that up to three victories in four matches against the now-ageing All Blacks, knocking the champions out 16–6 in the semi-final. Their passage had not been entirely smooth, though, and they had come perilously close to going out at the quarter-final stage when Gordon Hamilton's late try, a flank-forward outsprinting winger David Campese to the line, gave Ireland the lead unexpectedly: however, offered a penalty in front of the posts which would have tied the scores in the final minute, Australia opted to run the ball instead of kick, and fly-half Michael Lynagh scored the try which put them through 19–18. In David Campese - despite his discomfiture against Hamilton - they also boasted the joint top try-scorer of the tournament, with six. Their centre pairing of Horan and Little was also regarded as the best in the world - marginally ahead of England's Carling and Guscott, although the views on this were by no means unanimous.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nIn front of 56,000 spectators at Twickenham, Australia's resilient defence came to the fore in the opening half. Viliami Ofahengaue and Simon Poidevin both performed well in continually holding up the English attacking threat. Australia opened the scoring on 27 minutes with a Michael Lynagh penalty. Despite English dominance in possession, the only try of the match was scored just three minutes later by prop Tony Daly, touching down for a try following Ofahengaue's break from a line-out and subsequent drive from the Australian forwards. Michael Lynagh converted the try. At half-time Australia led England 9–0.\nSecond half.\nWill Carling, Rob Andrew and Roger Uttley insisted that England continue their open, running style but it failed to crack the Australians. Several of the English forwards, such as Jason Leonard, Brian Moore and Peter Winterbottom were reportedly furious at the decision, Leonard mentioned in his autobiography that both Moore and Winterbottom kept on telling Carling that the tactics needed to change as the English pack was clearly destroying the Australian pack up front. Webb put England on the scoreboard after an hour with a successful penalty kick. Lynagh added a further penalty for the Wallabies after 65 minutes. With the score at 12–3 to Australia, England had secured an overlap in an attack. Peter Winterbottom looked to pass to England winger Rory Underwood but the pass was knocked down by David Campese. This was seen as a deliberate knock-on designed to foil an England score. Welsh referee Derek Bevan awarded the penalty and waved away England calls for a penalty try. Jonathan Webb slotted his second penalty of the game but no further England points were to follow.\nBroadcasting.\nThis match was the last broadcast by Australia's national broadcaster the ABC."

The national team is currently ranked 95th by World Rugby\nGoverning body.\nThe sport is governed by the Fédération Rwandaise de Rugby.\nHistory.\nRwanda is a former colony of Belgium, and the game was first introduced from there.\nRwandan rugby had a low key but steady presence in colonial times; however, it went into decline post-Rwandan independence, and the horrors of the 1990s war also damaged the game beyond repair.\nHowever, the aid agencies which arrived in the wake of that tragedy have reintroduced the game, which is being taken up by many of the young. One person in particular has said: \"in my combined years I have yet to witness the passion and desire to play rugby as I did in Rwanda. The boys have such a passion to learn as much of the game as they can.\"\nRwanda has currently both a men's and a women's national rugby team."

The Senegal national team is currently ranked 54th by World Rugby.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Fédération Sénégalaise de Rugby.\nHistory.\nSenegal is a founder member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR), which was launched officially in January 1986, in Tunis, Tunisia. Rugby officials from Tunisia, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Kenya, the Seychelles and Madagascar attended.\nSenegal has a long-established union and players come from all walks of life.\nRugby has been played in Senegal by French colonialists since the 1920s, and they created a union in 1960. For 20 to 30 years rugby was a game only for the French colonists and the military.\nRugby was largely unknown among the Senegalese until the 1990s. In the late 1990s, the Fédération Sénégalaise de Rugby increased the visibility of the game among the Senegalese, with a new policy aiming to develop rugby in the schools.\nRugby took off in 2005 when Senegal participated in their first Rugby World Cup qualifying and played six international games.\nIn 2005, the national Rugby championships comprised just five clubs, all of them made up of French immigrants. Eight years later, there were 12 clubs, and all but one of them was fully Senegalese. In 2014, 18 clubs came to at least one of the national championships, whether it be men’s, women’s, Fifteens or Sevens.\nThis has led to the International Rugby Board increasing its development grant every year. The Senegalese federation has been growing rugby in Senegal. The Senegalese federation receives technical and training support from the IRB and the Confédération Africaine de Rugby (CAR), where professionals come to Senegal and deliver short, intensive courses.\nNational team.\nThe Senegal national team has been playing regular international rugby since 2003. \nIn 2005, Senegal participated in their first Rugby World Cup qualifying, and played six international games. The Senegalese union identified players of Senegal origin in France, and tried to build a stronger national team with expats to raise the profile of the game.\nSenegal are ranked in the top ten in Africa and in the top 50 in the world. They have shown that they can compete with the other African countries: in 2012, they lost to Namibia by just two points, and by only three in 2008.\nPlayers.\nNotable Senegalese players include Max Brito, who played for the Ivory Coast's national side, and had a notorious accident in the Rugby World Cup."

As of January 2021, the World Rugby Ranking of their men's national team is 98th.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Eswatini Rugby Union.\nHistory.\nRugby union was introduced into Eswatini by the British, who ruled the country for a number of years, sometimes indirectly, sometimes directly. However, it was mainly played by the white population, who made little attempt to spread it to the native Swazis, meaning that the game declined when they left.\nRugby is centred on the national capital Mbabane. Eswatini's poverty and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to maintain a proper national league structure, although its small size makes this less of a problem than with certain other African countries.\nThe country is nearly surrounded on all sides by South Africa, apart from one border with Mozambique. Rugby union in South Africa is a major sport - the country has both hosted and won the Rugby World Cup - and Eswatini is saturated by South African media of various types. Because of this, Eswatini can therefore be considered one of several countries within South African rugby's sphere of influence - including Namibia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, and Botswana.\nTrivia.\nEswatini has the highest number of rugby players per capita on the continent of Africa, with 12.9 out of every 1,000 locals being a registered player. This edges out South Africa who officially have 10.0 players per 1,000 people."

Writing back to approve the tour, the Mauritian secretary added, \"Please bring your own ball. We have lost ours.\"\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is Rugby Union Mauritius\nRugby Union Mauritius consists of approximately 600 licensees including players and officials.\nHistory.\nMauritius is a former British colony, and it was introduced there by the British military in the early twentieth century. In a parallel development, a number of wealthier young Mauritians went to British and South African boarding schools during this period, and also picked up the sport there.\nIn 1928, a group of Franco-Mauritian players set up the first club, the Dodo Club. The game expanded between then and 1975, with more clubs being created. However, the independence of Mauritius in 1968 led to financial difficulties for Mauritian rugby, and it was left to a development programme in the 1990s to revive the game properly.\nFrom 1928 to 1975 rugby was played at senior level between various clubs remembered as the Buffalos, HMS Mauritius, Blue Ducks, Dodo, the Navy, SMF and the Stags.\nThe 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa was broadcast on Mauritian television, and received a good deal of attention.\nThe Mauritius Sevens team participates in Indian Ocean tournaments with Réunion and Madagascar.\nSuccess in sevens led to the improvement of the fifteen a side game, and Mauritius played their first international against Tanzania in 2005, winning 20-10. They also won subsequent matches against Rwanda, Burundi and Burkina Faso. Their fantastic start to international rugby has caused tremendous growth of the sport in Mauritius, with thousands of people flocking to see them play. They participate in the south section of the CAR Castel Beer Trophy, which they surprisingly won in 2005. However, in both the 2006 and 2007 editions, the side's hopes were dashed in the group stage by Botswana, who went on to win in 2007.\nThe Franco-Mauritian ethnic minority group tends to dominate the game, as rugby is a much less popular sport amongst the Indo-Mauritian majority. This has led to some complaints of exclusivism:\nRugby went through a period of decline until in 1998, when the Stags Club was re-created and thus triggered the thought that rugby once again had a place in Mauritian society."

Located in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Basketball Hall of Fame is named after James Naismith, who invented the sport in 1891; he was inducted into the Hall as a contributor in 1959. The Coach category has existed since the beginning of the Hall of Fame. For a person to be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach, they must either be \"fully retired for five years\" or, if they are still active, \"have coached as either a fulltime assistant or head coach on the high school and/or college and/or professional level\" for 25 years.\nAs part of the inaugural class of 1959, three coaches were inducted (Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen, Henry Clifford Carlson and Walter E. Meanwell); in total, 100 individuals have been inducted into the Hall of Fame as coaches.\nSix coaching inductees were associated with teams that were inducted to the Hall of Fame as units. Don Haskins, inducted in 1997, was the coach of the 1966 Texas Western basketball team, which was inducted in 2007. Dutch Lonborg, inducted in 1973, was manager of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team that was inducted in 2010. Three coaching inductees were members of the staff for the 1992 U.S. Olympic team that was also inducted in 2010—head coach Chuck Daly (1994) and assistants Lenny Wilkens (1998) and Mike Krzyzewski (2001). Cathy Rush (2008) was the head coach of the Immaculata College women's team of 1972–1974 that was inducted in 2014.\nTen of the inducted coaches were born outside the United States: Cesare Rubini, Aleksandr J. Gomelsky, Antonio Díaz-Miguel, Aleksandar \"Aza\" Nikolić, Geno Auriemma, Alessandro \"Sandro\" Gamba, Mirko Novosel, Pedro Ferrándiz, Lidia Alexeeva, and Lindsay Gaze. Ten of the inducted coaches are women: L. Margaret Wade, Jody Conradt, Pat Head Summitt, Sandra Kay Yow, Sue Gunter, Rush, C. Vivian Stringer, Tara VanDerveer, Alexeeva, and Sylvia Hatchell. Five coaches have also been inducted as players: John Wooden, Bill Sharman, Wilkens, Tom Heinsohn, and Bill Russell. One of the more recent inductees in this category was John McLendon, who was inducted as a head coach in 2016. McLendon had also been inducted as a contributor in 1979, making him the first individual ever to be inducted as both a coach and contributor.\nUnlike recent years (such as 2015), in which individuals directly elected by special Hall committees were announced separately from the rest of the class, all 2016 inductees were announced at the same event. Specifically, the announcement of the class of 2016 was made on April 4 during the festivities surrounding the 2016 NCAA Men's Final Four in Houston.\nReferences.\nGeneral – Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame inductees\nGeneral – Other groups of coaches\nSpecific"

        "text": "Rugby union in Cyprus is a minor but growing sport.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Cyprus Rugby Federation\nIt became affiliated to FIRA in 2006.\nHistory.\nCypriot rugby goes back to at least the 1950s, when it was played by British Armed Forces there. The British military still contributes teams from the Akrotiri and Dhekelia bases.\nDuring the 1970s, rugby union in Israel trying to break out of its isolation - both political and geographical - reached out to teams in Cyprus. Many of the teams Israelis played with were British military.\nIn more recent times, it has mainly been a game played by expatriates.\nThere are several competitions including a league with teams from the British military bases and three local teams:\nCypriot rugby's main ties are to European rugby, although it does play Israel occasionally.\nThe situation in Northern Cyprus is somewhat different, with teams playing in the Turkish leagues. Rugby is not a major sport amongst Greek Cypriots, but it is even less so amongst Turkish Cypriots.\nIntroduction of rugby to Cyprus.\nRugby Football was introduced formally in league format in the early 1980s by the British Military due to the mannerism of their structure. However the first Cypriot Club was formed in 2003 known as, Paphos Tigers. Predominately made up of South African Cypriots they triumphed in the British Military Major Units League. The first game for Cyprus took place on 24 March 2007 at home against Greece. The Cypriot XV won 39-3. Cyprus continued their great start in international rugby by beating Azerbaijan 29-0 at the Pafiako Stadium in Paphos on 28 October 2007. They then put in back-to-back victories against Monaco on 31 October 2007 (19-10) and Slovakia on 3 November 2007 (38-8). Having won the FIRA ENC Division 3D Tournament, they qualified for a promotion playoff against Israel. The game took place on 6 September 2008, Cyprus were defeated 23-14 and therefore remained in ENC 3D with Azerbaijan, Bosnia Herzegovina, Monaco and Slovakia. Cyprus currently hold records over 3 nations in the division ENC 3D, by inflicting the worst defeats of Slovakia, Azerbaijan and Monaco respectively. During the 2009 FIRA AER European Sevens Championship, Cyprus Sevens Team took part in two tournaments in Athens and Split. Their performances during these competitions led to them jumping 11 places in the FIRA rankings and are currently ranked 12th in Europe.\nNational team.\nThe first international game of the Cyprus Rugby National Team took place on March 24, 2007 against Greece in Paphos. The Cypriot XV won the game by 39-3 in front of 2,500 fans.\nIn October and November 2007, Cyprus beat Azerbaijan, Monaco, Slovakia to win the FIRA 3D Tournament, a great achievement in their first year on the international scene. However, they lost the play-off game for promotion to level 3C on 6 September 2008 against Israel (which plays in the European leagues) by a score of 23-14.\nCyprus now play in the 2B level, after winning promotion consecutively from the 2008-2010 edition onwards."

        "text": "Rugby union in Malta is a small but growing sport. The national senior men's team are ranked 46th by the World Rugby.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Malta Rugby Football Union. Since 2000, the MRFU has been a full member of World Rugby.\nHistory.\nRugby was first brought into Malta by the British, who ruled the island for nearly 200 years. The first matches appear to have been played by British sailors during the late 19th century.\nIn 1946, the Overseas Rugby Club was established, becoming the first proper rugby club on the island, which consisted mainly of British servicemen.\nHowever, the game only started becoming properly organised at the end of the 20th century. During the 1970s, St. Edwards College and Tal-Handaq College started teaching the game, but it also received a blow, in 1979, with the withdrawal of Malta from NATO, which deprived it of the military teams which had formerly played there.\nIn 1983 a set of enthusiasts met at the Marsa sports ground, mainly ex-students of St Edwards College(who had previously played against the British forces based in Malta) and a few others, attracted by an advertisement in the \"Times of Malta\" and held an informal 10 a-side match which was the beginning of the re-introduction of Rugby to Malta. Saturday games continued in a sort of mix &amp; match style, dividing the numbers into two teams. As the numbers grew the Phoenician's Rugby Club was formed and that team played against teams visiting the island and the Navy ships which sporadically visited the island. \nPhoenicians also traveled several times to play Clubs in Sicily. \nA decision was made to create another Club for competition's sake and the Overseas Rugby Club was re-formed. At this time around 1986 a group of students who had studied at various schools in the UK returned to Malta to attend University and so the University Rugby Club was formed.\nBy 1990 a mini-league had been established of Overseas RC, Phoenicians and the University of Malta, which also saw a Cup and 7s competition, both initially won by Overseas RC. \nMatches were also played against visiting navy vessels and touring sides from the UK and Italy\nThe Kavallieri Rugby Club was formed in 1991 with many players coming from Water Polo and even some players from wrestling. Kavallieri entered Rugby as the Overseas \"B\" team, so they could learn the game under their tutelage. \nFor a period of two years the International Tourism School(ITS) formed under the guidance of a South African teacher, but due to the students having to engage in international work experience, they struggled for players and eventually disbanded. \nIn 1996 the Stompers Rugby Club was formed.\nIn 2006, women's rugby began in Malta, now boasting five active clubs and a strong national 7s program.\nDuring the 2008 national election, the Nationalist Party, or PN, included the construction of a national rugby stadium as an element in its platform. The PN was victorious in the 2008 election, and formed government. In 2010, it announced the beginning of the fulfillment of this promise through a plan for the construction of such a stadium, connected to a larger sporting, recreational and residential complex with at least one rugby pitch beyond that of the stadium.\nDue to its mild Mediterranean climate, Malta is a popular destination for rugby tours.\nDomestic Competitions.\nAs of the 2009–2010 season (the Maltese domestic rugby season traditionally runs through the Northern Hemisphere winter), there were four primary domestic competitions for senior men, two for senior women, and three age-grade competitions for junior boys.\nSenior Men:\n\"The 10-aside competitions function as \"second division\" competitions, consisting largely of clubs' second teams and teams from smaller clubs.\"\nSenior Women:\nJunior Boys:\nClubs.\nThere are seven active (entered at least one of the national competitions in 2009–10) clubs in Malta, as follows:\nNational teams.\nThe Malta national rugby union team (men's) competes in the European Nations Cup (ENC). They have done well, when compared to the size and playing population of the country. They completed the 2008-2010 competition in Division 2B of the ENC. They finished 3rd in the two-year competition, meaning that they are playing in the same division (renamed \"2A\") for the 2010-2012 competition. A number of players come from the Maltese diaspora in the UK and Australia. However, the number of locally based players is increasing.\nThe Maltese national women's rugby 7s team have been very successful in European competitions, earning promotion in 2009 to the \"A\" division of these tournaments (the middle of three European divisions).\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Malta's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2004.

        "title": "Clyde Williams (American football)",
        "text": "Samuel Clyde Williams (March 24, 1879 – March 20, 1938) was an All-American football player at the University of Iowa, and a football, basketball, and baseball coach and athletic director at Iowa State University. He is a member of both schools' Halls of Fame.\nCollege career.\nWilliams was born in Shelby, Iowa. He played college football for the University of Iowa under coach Alden Knipe. Knipe was a stern disciplinarian, and friction soon arose between Knipe and the older players of the 1898 Hawkeye football team. After Iowa started the season 1–4–1, Ralph Blackmore led the \"Blackmore Revolt\", in which five upperclassmen quit the team. Knipe simply started younger players, including Clyde Williams, who was a freshman at the time. With Williams at quarterback, Iowa finished the year 2–0–1, ending the season with a 6–5 victory over rival Nebraska. Nebraska had been heavy favorites and were coached by Fielding H. Yost.\nIn Williams' sophomore season in 1899, Iowa faced heavily favored Chicago, coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg. The Hawks scored a touchdown against Chicago, while the Maroons could muster only a field goal. Since both were scored as five points in those days, Iowa settled for a 5–5 tie. Chicago went on to win the 1899 Western Conference title with a 12–0–2 record.\nUnder Williams, the Hawkeyes did not yield another point all year, winning their last seven games by a combined score of 194–0. Iowa closed the 1899 season by defeating Illinois in their first ever meeting by a 58–0 score. That capped off an 8–0–1 season for the Hawkeyes, their first ever undefeated season. Less than 24 hours after the season ended, the University of Iowa accepted an invitation for membership in the Western Conference. Caspar Whitney in Collier's Magazine named Clyde Williams as the top quarterback in the West in 1899.\nIn Williams' junior season in 1900, the Hawkeyes won their first four non-conference games by a combined score of 198–0. Chicago loomed as Iowa's first ever Big Ten opponent. Chicago had won the Western Conference the previous year and handed Iowa its only blemish on the season in 1899. After a scoreless first half, the Hawks scored two quick touchdowns early in the second period and Iowa won, 17–0. Iowa's next game was against Michigan, in Detroit. The Hawkeyes led 28–0 before Michigan managed a field goal to prevent the shutout, the first points scored on Iowa in 1900. But the Hawkeyes dominated the Wolverines and won, 28–5.\nThe victories over Chicago and Michigan allowed Iowa to earn a share of the Big Ten title with Minnesota in Iowa's first year in the conference. The Hawkeyes finished with a 7–0–1 record, their second straight undefeated season. After the season, Clyde Williams was named a third-team All-American by Walter Camp. Williams was the first player west of the Mississippi River to garner All-American honors. As a result, Clyde Williams is often referred to as \"Iowa's first All-American\".\nOnly three starters returned in Williams' senior season in 1901. Williams was named as Iowa's team captain. The Hawkeyes won their first three games of 1901 before preparing to play fellow defending Western Conference champion, Minnesota. 25 minutes before the game, Williams was told he was ineligible to play for the remainder of the season, because he had played summer baseball under an assumed name. A deflated Hawkeye team lost to Minnesota, 16–0, losing their first game and yielding their first touchdown in 23 games. Iowa finished with a 6–3 record in 1901.\nIn four years as a starting quarterback at Iowa, Williams never lost a game. The Hawkeyes' record in games Williams started, from the middle of the 1898 season to the middle of the 1901 season, was 23–0–3. He earned 11 letters at Iowa, four in football, four in baseball, and three in track.\nCoaching career.\nAfter serving as an Iowa assistant football coach for two years, Williams went to Ames, Iowa as an assistant football coach for Iowa State University. Williams served as the Cyclones' head football coach for six seasons from 1907 to 1912. During that time, he had a coaching record of 32–15–2. This ranks him sixth at Iowa State in total wins and fourth at Iowa State in winning percentage. In addition, he led Iowa State to two Missouri Valley Conference football titles in 1911 and 1912, which are currently the only two conference football championships in school history.\nWilliams was the school's first men's basketball coach from 1908 to 1911, where he compiled a 20–29 record. He also served as Iowa State's baseball coach and was their athletic director from 1914 to 1919.\nDeath.\nWilliams died on March 20, 1938, at his home, in Sheldon, Iowa, following several months of illness.\nHonors.\nIowa State's home football stadium from 1915 through 1975 was named Clyde Williams Field in Williams's honor. It was replaced when Iowa State moved to their current facility, Jack Trice Stadium. \nWilliams was inducted into the State of Iowa Hall of Fame in 1956. He is also one of the few people inducted into both the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1993) and the Iowa State Athletics Hall of Fame (inducted 1997)."

Furthermore, a \"no ID, no sitting on the bench rule\" will be implemented to avoid what happened last season when La Salle coach Franz Pumaren was slapped a technical foul for not wearing his ID. Lipa said that the referees \"must have the integrity\" and their diverse backgrounds should not be a drawback for Lipa had been an advocate of having diverse groups of referees participating in a single tournament \"instead of having the attitude of being parochial.\"\nDue to the high demand of tickets for Ateneo-La Salle games, host FEU has devised a way for allocating tickets for fans of the two schools, although the Ateneo-La Salle game will still be a part of a doubleheader, tickets will be sold separately for the Ateneo-La Salle and the following FEU-UE game. The patrons who only have tickets for one game has to watch only the game stated on their tickets and has to leave when the other game is being held.

Charlie was excavated from Windmill Hill, Avebury in the 1920s and is currently on display at the Alexander Keiller Museum at Avebury.\nThere is a certain amount of controversy surrounding the display of the skeleton. The Council of British Druid Orders (CoBDO) demanded that the skeleton be reburied where it was found, or as near as is practically possible, claiming that putting a skeleton in a museum \"as an attraction\" is disrespectful. The archaeological community fear that reburying Charlie will lead to a dangerous precedent being set. Historians have also argued that Charlie's skeleton should be kept in a museum so it is available for research. English Heritage and The National Trust held a public consultation on the future of Charlie; in April 2010 the decision was made to keep the skeleton on public view."

        "text": "The basketball tournaments of NCAA Season 85 refers to the basketball events of the Philippine National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s 2009–10 season. This is the first season without the PCU Dolphins who have taken an indefinite leave of absence after several of their juniors' division players were found to have used falsified documents to enter the school. Also, three guest teams will take part in the basketball events with all three eligible to win championships.\nThe games began on June 27 at the Araneta Coliseum with an opening ceremony led by San Beda, with a keynote speech by United States Ambassador to the Philippines Kristie Kenney, culminating with a tripleheader with season host San Beda Red Lions routing the Mapua Cardinals 82–55 in the opening game. The four-time juniors champion San Sebastian Staglets will also begin their title defense, with a majority of the games being held at the Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan.\nIn the men's division, the San Sebastian Stags had an all-time league-best 15-game winning streak, ending on their second-round game against the Letran Knights. The Stags ended the elimination round tied with the San Beda Red Lions for first, who beat them in the elimination round finale. The Red Lions defeated the Stags in the playoff for the #1 seed, and they were beaten anew by the third seed JRU Heavy Bombers in the first game of the semifinals. The Stags beat the Heavy Bombers in Game 2 to meet the Red Lions in the Finals who had previously beaten the Knights in their own semifinals. Game 1 of the Finals went into two overtimes, with the Stags eking out a 4-point triumph. The Red Lions, who led for majority of the game, faltered in the fourth quarter of Game 2 to allow the Stags to clinch their first title since 2002. Jimbo Aquino of San Sebastian was named Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) in his final playing year.\nIn the juniors' division, the Letran Squires had a 17-game winning streak, only for them to be beaten by the San Beda Red Cubs in the last game of the elimination round. The Red Cubs blew out the Squires in the playoff for #1, but both teams did not need their twice-to-beat advantage to eliminate the JRU Light Bombers and the San Sebastian Staglets respectively in the semifinals. In Game 1 of the Finals, San Beda blew out Letran for the second game in a row, but the Squires outlasted the Red Cubs in Game 2 via a late three-pointer to force Game 3. In the deciding game, San Beda pulled away late in the fourth quarter after Letran cut down the 15-point lead to two points to give retiring coach Ato Badolato his 15th juniors' championship. The Squires suffered their third consecutive Finals defeat; they previously lost twice to the Staglets prior losing to the Red Cubs. Baser Amer was awarded the Finals MVP award.\nJRU players John Wilson and Louie Vigil were awarded Most Valuable Player honors for the men's and juniors' divisions respectively. American Sudan Daniels and Baser Amer both from San Beda were named men's and juniors' Rookies of the Year.\nMen's tournament.\nTeams.\nChanges from last season.\nGuest teams:\nDeparted team:\nPreseason.\nThe league announced that the games will be held at the Filoil Flying V Arena for most games and the Araneta Coliseum for bigger games, while the other sports will be held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and the PhilSports Complex via a partnership with the Philippine Sports Commission. The NCAA originally wanted to play in the Rizal Memorial Coliseum \"But it's still under repair so maybe next year,\" management committee chairman Jose Mari Lacson of San Beda College said.\nFormer UST Growling Tigers head coach Aric del Rosario was appointed as the league commissioner who immediately warning players not to commit dangerous fouls, and the more strict enforcement of the handcheck foul. Another new rule is that there would now be two people on the bench allowed to stand up instead of only one previously; del Rosario said that the head coach and his head assistant are now allowed to stand up. If a third person is caught standing up, a warning will be issued, and on the second violation, a technical foul will be charged on the team.\nFurthermore, a new system of filing game protests concerning results, eligibility of players and the like will be used:\nElimination round.\nFirst round.\nJune–July.\nWith a total of ten teams this season, the traditional quadruple–header at the Araneta Coliseum would not be held but instead the opening Saturday would consist of three games: in the traditional champion vs. host opening game, season host and defending champion San Beda blew out the 2008 hosts Mapua 85–52, JRU overcame a late surge by Letran by winning 69–66, and San Sebastian defeated UPHSD in the nightcap, 76–64.\nWith the Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan hosting the rest of the elimination round in the second day, CSB overcame AUF's late surge, and Arellano blew out fellow hosts EAC. In a day of upsets, San Sebastian gave San Beda its worst start in their last four seasons, while guests Arellano defeated Letran anew, placing the Knights at the bottom of the standings. JRU and Benilde remained unbeaten, winning against UPHSD and Mapua respectively to join Arellano and San Sebastian at the top of the standings with a 2–0 slate at the end of the first week of competition.\nSan Beda dealt Arellano their first loss at the start of week 2, with the Great Danes winning their first game against fellow guest school EAC. In a battle of winless teams, Letran rallied from behind, but this time won against UPHSD, and in the battle of undefeated teams, San Sebastian pulled away at the second half to beat CSB. In Friday's blowout games, Mapua notched their first win against AUF, and JRU kept up with San Sebastian with a trashing of EAC.\nIn week three, San Beda blew out their opponents: a 20–point drubbing of Benilde, and a 33–point massacre of UPHSD. JRU and San Sebastian continued their unbeaten runs with double–digit wins over guest teams Arellano and EAC respectively. The other guest team, AUF, also suffered a double–digit loss against UPHSD, while Letran won the Battle of Intramuros emphatically with a 22–point blowout against Mapua.\nSan Sebastian and JRU continued their unbeaten runs; the Stags defeated the Chiefs, and the Heavy Bombers blowing out the Great Danes. The Generals clinched their first win in the league with a victory over Mapua, while the Blazers escaped with a one–point win over the Altas. Prior to the CSB-UPHSD game, San Beda and Letran faced off with the Red Lions winning by five points, but that is before Letran's Kris Alas pushed Sudan Daniel, that started a free-for-all; Letran's Jaypee Belencion confronted fans at the stands, and Kevin's father Louie Alas, Letran's head coach, had to shield his wife from debris being pelted on the court.\nIn the end, Kris Alas and Belencion were suspended, the former by one game and the latter by three games, while Louie Alas, his brother and assistant coach of Letran Mel, his son Keven, and Daniels were given stern warnings by the Management Committee (MANCOM).\nThe CSB vs. EAC game would devolve into another physical game with several Blazers figuring in a bench-clearing incident; despite CSB's Jeff Morial having 32 points, the Generals notched another win, marking their first winning streak in the NCAA. Meanwhile, San Sebastian extended their winning streak to six with another blowout win, this time against AUF, but not before AUF's Chuck Gomez threw a punch to the opponent. As a result, the MANCOM suspended CSB's Chuck Dalanon and Jan Tan, and Gomez for one game.\nJRU matched San Sebastian with a win against Mapua, while Letran rebounded with a win against AUF. In a game that needed three overtimes to finish, CSB thwarted off Arellano by ten points, after Morial sank in 31 points, and hitting crucial three–pointers. Morial converted two three-pointers in the end of regulation to force the first overtime, then another to extend the game into the third overtime, and the last putting away the Chiefs for good. Despite scoring 29 points, mostly in the first half, AU's Gio Ciriacruz fouled out late in the fourth quarter, which started disqualifications of five other Chiefs. Meanwhile, San Beda held off EAC to keep pace with the Stags and the Heavy Bombers at the top.\nAugust.\nIn a meeting of the two 6–0 teams, the Stags won emphatically over JRU, although the Bombers rebounded with a win over CSB later in the week. Perpetual Help won against Mapua, but before losing to the Chiefs, while San Beda and Letran held off separate opponents, with the Knights needing an extra period to ward off the Generals.\nSan Beda and JRU ended their first round with a rematch of last year's Finals series in which the Red Lions won. Although both teams sported 7–1 cards, the Heavy Bombers faltered for the second consecutive big game anew, losing the Red Lions to close out their first round campaign on a losing note. Meanwhile, San Sebastian was taken by Mapua to the limit before losing by three points, to set up an anticipated game against arch rival Letran at the first round finale. The Cardinals themselves ended the first round on a 6-game losing streak, after falling to the Arellano Chiefs who closed out with their own 4-game winning streak; prior to their Mapua win, the Chiefs also won against cellar-dweller AUF. Perpetual Help gave EAC their second 4-game losing streak with an 86–79 win.\nIn the first round finale, Letran led for majority of the game, even by as much as ten at halftime, before the Stags staged a third quarter rally to lead by double digits. The Knights clawed through, and had a chance to extend the game into overtime, but Kevin Alas' off-balanced three-pointer rattled in and out of the rim as time expired to give San Sebastian their first first round sweep since their 1997 championship run.\nSecond round.\nAugust.\nSan Sebastian extended their winning streak to 10 with a rather unexpected 12-point win against AUF; as JRU rebounded with a win against Perpetual Help. Letran and Arellano both won their respective first second-round games against EAC and CSB respectively, while San Beda outlasted Mapua to extend their own winning streak to eight, and lengthen Mapua's losing streak to seven. San Sebastian added to UPHSD's woes as they gave the Altas a 0–2 second round record.\nLetran and Arellano remained locked at fourth with wins against Mapua and AUF; Letran's win over Mapua was their first second round win in eight seasons against their Intramuros neighbors. San Beda and JRU also had easy wins against EAC and CSB to remain undefeated in the second round. Emilio Aguinaldo College would notch their first win the second round with a thriller over Perpetual Help, and RJ Jazul saved the Knights from a 0–2 season sweep against Arellano with a clutch three–pointer to break Letran and Arellano's tie at fourth place.\nSan Beda and JRU still maintained the second and third places in the team standings with easy wins against doormats Angeles University Foundation and Mapua; both losing schools were eliminated from semifinals contention.\nSeptember.\nThe trend of the top four teams beating the bottom six continued with San Sebastian and Letran winning over their opponents, with both teams settling for blowout wins against EAC and CSB respectively, and San Sebastian clinching the first semifinal ticket. San Beda and JRU ended the week how it started, with easy wins against Perpetual Help and Arellano respectively, giving the two teams tickets to the semifinals.\nAUF surprisingly hung tough against Letran in the first three quarters but the Knights pulled away at the fourth quarter to cement their hold at fourth-place. Meanwhile, San Sebastian extend their winning streak to thirteen games with another blowout win against Mapua. EAC denied CSB of a win against the guest team, denying the Blazers for the seventh consecutive year a Final Four berth. Meanwhile, San Beda gave Arellano's Final Four hopes in peril with a 9-point win. In the Friday games, Mapua broke their 10-game losing streak with a spirited win against Perpetual Help, and JRU's defense held up against Letran for a blowout win against the Knights to score a 5–0 second round record. Letran's loss meant that they won't be able to clinch the twice-to-beat advantage in the semifinals, leaving San Sebastian, San Beda and JRU the only teams in contention for the coveted advantage.\nSan Sebastian tied the record set by the San Beda Red Lions in the 2006 season, with 14 consecutive wins with a win against St. Benilde. EAC avenged their first round loss against AUF with a double-digit win, with Letran had another fourth quarter run to pull away against UPHSD in the endgame. The Heavy Bombers finally caught up with the Red Lions, fashioning out a 13-point win thanks to Mark Cagoco's three-point shooting. The win tied the two teams for second place. In the week's last pair of games, Mapua hands Letran the last semifinal berth with a double-digit upset against the Chiefs, while CSB ends their 6-game losing streak with an easy win against AUF.\nMapua continued their end-of-season run, this time outlasting EAC to clinch their third consecutive win, as San Sebastian broke the record for most consecutive wins with a dismantling of the Chiefs, bringing their total wins to 15. JRU and San Beda remained tied for #2 with contrasting wins against AUF and CSB; JRU had to grind it out with AUF which is in a 14-game losing streak, while San Beda had an easier time as a depleted CSB ran out of gas in the fourth quarter. Arellano won to clinch fifth place and the 2009 Philippine Collegiate Championship wildcard entry that goes along with it, against UPHSD.\nIn the San Sebastian-Letran rivalry game, the Knights employed the full-court press in the opening moments that made the game a low-scoring affair; several technical and unsportsmanlike fouls were called, and the Knights pulled away in the second quarter. The Stags had a rally in the third quarter to bring the lead down to single-digits, but shooting from Smart Gilas mainstays RJ Jazul and Rey Guevarra padded Letran's lead to an insurmountable 15–point lead that gave San Sebastian their first loss in the season.\nOctober.\nTropical Storm Ketsana (local name: Ondoy) struck Metro Manila on September 26 causing massive flooding in Eastern Metro Manila and western Rizal. Due to the flooding, eight men's and juniors' games were rescheduled. With the resumption of games on October 2 a week after the tropical storm hit, games resumed but not after a moment of silence was observed commemorating all victims of the typhoon, including Philippine Basketball Association team Barako Bull Energy Boosters manager and former Letran Squires football player Tony Chua, who died in the height of the storm. San Beda had an easy win against Letran, but not before Letran's Rey Guevarra was injured after he hit San Beda's Sudan Daniel. Guevarra would be ruled out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. AUF continued with their second round slump, losing to Mapua which has now won four consecutive games.\nPerpetual Help continued winless in the second round, this time losing to the Great Danes, which notched their second win after losing 15 consecutive times; EAC beat Arellano to split their elimination round series against each other, with AU ending the elimination round at fifth place. UPHSD ended the second round winless, losing to CSB, which later in the week lost their last game against Mapua. CSB had more wins than their brother school De La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP, although both Lasallian schools were eliminated in their respective leagues. Meanwhile, San Sebastian clinched the twice-to-beat advantage in the semifinals with a win over JRU, which won their last game of the season against EAC with a 36-point rout to end their elimination round campaign with a win; the Generals ended tied for sixth and presumably holds the tiebreakers against Mapua and CSB and can clinch the NCAA's last zonal berth in the 2009 Philippine Collegiate Championship.\nIn the elimination round finale, San Sebastian was beaten by San Beda in a thrilling finish; with the score tied, a tightly guarded Jimbo Aquino turned over the ball, leading to a wide-open fastbreak lay-up by Bambam Gamalinda to forge a playoff for #1 between the two teams.\nBracket.\nOvertime\nSemifinals.\nSan Beda and San Sebastian have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\nControversies.\nNon-coverage controversy.\nPreviously, only the Wednesday and Friday pre-Final Four games, including the opening ceremonies were aired on Studio 23. But beginning this season, all NCAA games are seen live on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, with an HD simulcast on Balls. However, on July 27, 2009, ABS-CBN, through UHF channel Studio 23 did not air the scheduled NCAA games to give way for the State of the Nation Address of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Likewise, on August 5, 2009, the scheduled NCAA games were not aired live to give way to former President Corazon Aquino's funeral. The snub disappointed the NCAA fans and even the school representatives. This was in stark contrast to Studio 23's coverage of the UAAP games, where all of its games are aired. As a result, they are now in the process of exploring different options in considering a new broadcast partner.\nJuniors' tournament.\nGames will begin on June 28 at the San Juan Gym, while all remaining elimination round games will be held at the Filoil Flying V Arena in San Juan, with two rescheduled games held at the Ynares Sports Arena in Pasig.\nElimination round.\nJRU Light Bomber Joshua Saret broke the record established for fellow Light Bomber Keith Agovida last year by scoring 89 points in a 171–43 rout of the AUF Baby Danes.\nBroadcast notes.\nStudio 23 carried all games live. SkyCable Channel 166 (Balls HD) aired the finals series on high definition live, with Balls SD airing the replays. The Filipino Channel broadcast the games outside the Philippines."

        "text": "The Big East Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year award is given to the women's basketball player in the Big East Conference voted as the top performer by the conference coaches. It was first awarded at the end of the 1982–83 season, the first in which the Big East sponsored women's basketball. The current Big East claims the history of the original Big East Conference, which split along football lines in 2013, with three members leaving to join the Atlantic Coast Conference, the seven members that did not field teams in NCAA Division I FBS leaving to form a new Big East Conference, and the remaining FBS schools continuing to operate under the original Big East charter with the new name of American Athletic Conference (The American).\nThe head coaches of the league's teams submit their votes following the end of the regular season and before the conference's tournament in early March. The coaches cannot vote for their own players.\nThe first award went to Debbie Beckford of St. John's in 1983. There have been eight multiple winners so far. Rebecca Lobo, Diana Taurasi, and Paige Bueckers, all of UConn; Notre Dame's Skylar Diggins; and Villanova's Maddy Siegrist each won the award twice in their careers. Bueckers is the only one of these players whose awards were not in consecutive seasons. Shelly Pennefather of Villanova and Kerry Bascom and Maya Moore of UConn were each three-time winners. Pennefather and Bascom won all of their awards consecutively, while Moore did not.\nSo far, voting has resulted in a tie once, in 1984 when both Jennifer Bruce and Kathy Finn won the award.\nEight players have also won National Player of the Year awards. Rebecca Lobo, Ruth Riley, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, and Paige Bueckers are all recipients of the Naismith College Player of the Year award. Shelly Pennefather, Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti, Bird, Taurasi, and Moore are all recipients of the Wade Trophy. Moore and Bueckers are also recipients of the John R. Wooden Award.\nUConn, a founding member of the original Big East that moved to The American with the conference split and joined the current Big East in 2020, has the most all-time awards, with 19, and the most individual winners, with 12. Apart from UConn, the only current Big East members with more than one winner are Villanova, with three players who combined to win six awards; DePaul, with three players who each won one award; and Creighton and Marquette, each with two players who claimed one award. Three current Big East members have yet to have a winner—Seton Hall, which was a charter member of the Big East in 1979, and Butler and Xavier, both of which joined the Big East at its 2013 relaunch."

He played three games as an outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Spiders in 1899. Bristow was 5 feet, 10 inches, and weighed 170 pounds.\nCareer.\nBristow was born in Paw Paw, Illinois, in 1870. He started his professional baseball career in 1894. In 1895, Bristow was a pitcher and captain for the Texas-Southern League's Galveston Sandcrabs. He won 23 consecutive games that year, breaking Jack Luby's \"world's record\" of 20. Bristow, who played second base while not pitching, also had a batting average of .341 in 89 games.\nBristow spent most of the following season playing for the Newark Colts of the Atlantic League. In 52 games there, he batted .324 and had a 10-7 win–loss record as a pitcher. Bristow then had one-year stints in the Texas League (Waco Tigers) and Southwestern League before being acquired by the National League's Cleveland Spiders in early 1899. He made his major league debut on April 15 against pitcher Cy Young, going hitless. On April 21, he sprained his ankle and had to leave the game. Bristow's third appearance came on May 8, when he replaced an ejected Lave Cross. Bristow doubled in that game for his first and only major league hit. Later that month, he was released to the Western League's Kansas City Blues and never appeared in the majors again.\nFor the next few years, Bristow played in the minors. He batted .251 in the Western League in 1900 before moving on to the Iowa-South Dakota League, Pacific National League, Pacific Coast League, and Northwestern League, where he was a player-manager in 1905.\nBristow's professional baseball career ended in 1906. He died in Bellingham, Washington, in 1939, and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery."

A live audience of 120,000 patrons was there for the 194-minute race in which five cautions would slow the field for 34 laps; there were a total of 31 lead changes over the course of the 200 laps. Allison's margin of victory over Cale Yarborough was 23 seconds, more than half a lap.\nNo Chevrolet vehicles were in this race; the last time this happened was at the 1971 Space City 300 at Meyer Speedway in Texas.\nThis event marked the first Daytona 500 starts for Joe Ruttman, Ron Bouchard, Jim Sauter, Rick Wilson, Tom Sneva, Mark Martin, Delma Cowart, Rusty Wallace, and Lake Speed, the only Daytona 500 start for Lowell Cowell, and the last Daytona 500 starts for Roy Smith, Gary Balough, Tighe Scott, Stan Barrett, Bobby Wawak, Donnie Allison, Billie Harvey, and Joe Millikan.\nBumpergate.\nAllison's win caused controversy when his rear bumper fell off during the race. Allison's car was apparently tapped from behind by Cale Yarborough as they raced through turns three and four early in the race. After contact, Allison's bumper peeled off and flew high into the air before landing back in traffic. Several cars either ran over the bumper or collided while trying to avoid it, causing a huge crash that brought out the race's first caution.\nAfter the bumper was off Allison's car, it was consistently faster than the competition allowing him to pull away to a significant lead despite other drivers working together in the draft. Yarborough's crew chief, Tim Brewer, later intimated that Allison's team had intended for the bumper to come off because they knew it would offer a major aerodynamic advantage, either using hollow bolts or very thin wire to attach it superficially to the car. Allison and his crew chief Gary Nelson denied that and continue to deny it to this day.\nConsolation race.\nFourteen cars competed in a consolation race for non-qualifiers. Slick Johnson started from the pole in the event; he finished second, with Tim Richmond winning the 30-lap race. Ronnie Thomas, Bill Meazel and James Hylton rounded out the top five."

        "text": "The 1969 Daytona 500 was a NASCAR Grand National Series race held on February 23, 1969, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nRace report.\nLeeRoy Yarbrough chased down Charlie Glotzbach, who had an 11-second lead, and passed him on the final lap after starting 19th. It was the first Daytona 500 won on a last lap pass. Yarbrough won in a back-up Ford car after crashing his primary one. This would also be the second-last Daytona 500 before the NASCAR Grand National Series became the Winston Cup Series in 1971. Starting in 1971, all races were to have 43 competitors maximum in a starting grid starting with the 1971 Daytona 500.\nUsing a grid of 51 competitors (commonplace during the 1950s and 1960s), the average speed of the race was . \nFirst Daytona 500 starts for Benny Parsons, Ray Elder, Vic Elford, Richard Brickhouse, Cecil Gordon, Dick Brooks, Ben Arnold, J. D. McDuffie, and Pete Hamilton. Only Daytona 500 start for George Bauer, E. J. Trivette, Swede Savage, Bobby Unser, Bill Kimmel, Billy Taylor, and Dick Poling.

Only Daytona 500 start for Butch Hirst, Paul Feldner, Ron Grana, and Leonard Blanchard. Last Daytona 500 starts for Richard Brickhouse, Roy Mayne, and Dr. Don Tarr.\nSummary.\nNASCAR's modern era would commence with this race. Winged, aerodynamic cars built specifically for high-speed superspeedway racing such as the Plymouth Superbird and Ford Torino Talladega made their debut. Pete Hamilton, hired by Petty Enterprises shortly before the season, won the race in the #40 Plymouth Superbird just three car lengths over David Pearson, after passing him with nine laps to go. It was the first win for the new Plymouth Superbird.\nThis race would last 200 minutes, with an audience of 103,800 people watching. A grand total of 24 lead changes were made with an average green flag run of 22 laps. 23% of the race was held under a yellow flag; blown engines were the primary culprit behind the caution periods.\nOn lap 7, Cecil Gordon and Richard Petty blew their engines. Jim Vandiver blew his engine on lap 15 while Cale Yarborough would do the same thing on lap 32. A. J. Foyt would also blow his engine on lap 58 while Buddy Arrington wrecked his vehicle on lap 77 by crashing it into a wall. The final caution the race came when Dick Brooks blew his engine on lap 181.\nBuddy Arrington had a brand new #5 Dodge Daytona for the 1970 season but totaled it out here with a hard crash at full speed into the outside wall. He hit the wall so hard the big wing on the Charger actually broke with its top cross bar ripping off the car then flying 60 feet down the track spinning in the air.\nFollowing the wreck NASCAR mandated that all of the wing cars would have to have a steel cable to anchor the wing to the frame to avoid a repeat of this incident. John Sears actually drove under the flying piece of Arrington's wing as it soared over the track. He was apparently quite scared it was going to hit him. Arrington later said this was the worst wreck of his entire NASCAR career; as it left him with several broken ribs and a ruptured spleen. The Daytona 500 was not a race that Buddy Arrington would finish in good form; finishing in 29th place after qualifying in 32nd place. Arrington eventually got back on the track a few months later at the 1970 Rebel 400. \nDavid Pearson tried to slingshot Pete Hamilton in the last turn, but got very loose and finished second."

The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nSpeedweeks.\n32-year-old Buddy Baker believed it was finally his year. He had won the pole (see above), and in the first Twin 125 race, Baker fought off the effects of an ear infection and beat Cale Yarborough, 1968 champion of the Daytona 500, in a sprinted duel. In that first race, a 26-year-old Tennessee rookie named Darrell Waltrip, had one of the most impressive runs. Driving his own 1971 Mercury, Waltrip finished sixth and captured the eleventh starting spot for his first 500.\nAnother Tennessee driver stole the spotlight that day, Coo Coo Marlin, a 41-year-old journeyman whose best finish in four previous 500s was 18th, shocked the crowd by passing David Pearson with 6 laps to go to win the second twin 125. Richard Petty finished fourth in the first Twin 125 and was not happy with his Dodge until his crew made major suspension changes the day before the race.\nRace Summary.\nRace morning dawned gray and rainy. Similar to the 1979 race, the race was started under caution and began with 13 laps under yellow to have the cars help dry the track. Once under green Baker led the first 33 laps as Yarborough, Petty, Issac, and Pearson clung tenaciously to him. Petty lead for the first time on lap 37. But as the race continued, Baker took over. He took the lead from Issac on lap 40 and led 17 circuits. Then he led laps 71 through 102 before Yarborough squeezed past. But Baker took over again on lap 109.\nBy this time, Petty was out of sequence with the field. he cut a right rear tire on lap 88 and was forced to the pits. he lost a lap. He would make up the lap when the leaders pitted, but lose it when he pitted again.\nWith 50 laps to go, Baker was in front. He had dominated, leading 119 of the first 150 circuits, even as Yarborough stubbornly hung with him. As usual, engine problems took their toll. Pete Hamilton the 1970 winner who had qualified second, was first out on lap 33. David Pearson's engine expired after 63 laps. Bobby Allison and Coo Coo Marlin's engines also blew.\nOn lap 155, John Utsman's engine blew and he spun just past the finish line. Petty was back on the lead lap with Baker, but about to head for the pits. Petty just missed the spinning car. The yellow flag gave Petty another break. It allowed him to pit with Baker and remain on the lead lap. Meanwhile, Yarborough's engine quit during the caution period. He was out of the race. Yarborough had led six times for 25 laps and his spirited challenge of Baker had kept the fans entertained all afternoon.\nNow it was down to Petty and Baker. They were the only drivers still on the lead lap. Baker led laps 165 through 184, but both drivers needed one more quick stop for fuel. Petty came in first. He waited until the last moment before diving off turn four on lap 189 and screamed into his pit. Petty's car spewed tire smoke as he slid to a perfect stop. Five gallons and 8.4 seconds later, Petty was on his way.\nBaker came in the next lap. He did not enter the pits as quickly. His stop took 9.9 seconds. When both cars reached full speed, Petty had a 4.4-second lead. Baker immediately began closing the gap. With six laps remaining, he was only 2.5 seconds behind. Suddenly, Baker's engine blew. It was over.\nPetty won his fourth Daytona 500, he would win three more. Waltrip finished his first 500 in 12th. His first and only Daytona 500 win didn't come until 1989.\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for Hershel McGriff, Darrell Waltrip, Ed Negre, John Utsman, Marty Robbins, and Earl Ross. Only Daytona 500 starts for Vic Parsons and Larry Smith.

While the World Series of Poker was already drawing larger crowds as more and more amateurs sought it out, the SBOP \"was an affair limited almost exclusively to pros and hard-core amateurs.\"\nPrior to 1979, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP. 1972 WSOP Main Event Champion and outspoken ambassador for poker Amarillo Slim saw this as an opportunity. \"The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament,\" he said. Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979. Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament \"more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire.\" Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event.\nOne of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure. The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool. The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure. In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third. This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.\n1989 Tournament.\nThe 1989 SBOP was the third time wherein Poker Hall of Famer Stu Ungar won the Main Event. Ungar was the only person to win back-to-back tournaments and the only person to win the SBOP three times. Ungar was also the only person to win the WSOP Main Event three times. While Johnny Moss is a three-time WSOP Main Event winner, his first victory came as a result of a vote rather than the elimination tournament that it would assume the following year. Berry Johnston, another Hall of Famer, also won an event by claiming the title in the $200 Pot Limit Omaha with Rebuys tournament. Relatively little is preserved about the 1989 tournament. In most cases, the only thing that has been preserved was the name of the event winners, and in a few cases not even that much was recorded."

Gabe's victory at this event sparked a wave of curiosity around the country. With his victory, people started to realize that anybody could play poker. Gabe went on to finish in sixth place at the 1980 World Series of Poker Main Event. These two victories propelled Gabe into the poker elite. Over the next several years Gabe had tremendous success at the SBOP. In 1982 he would finish in third place at the Main Event. In 1983 he would have a first and second-place finish in Lowball events. Then again in 1984 he would win another SBOP title in a Lowball tournament.\nWhile Gabe's story caught the world's attention at the SBOP, another story went unnoticed. A young poker player named Stu Ungar made his first ever poker tournament appearance at the SBOP Main Event. When Stu was knocked out in 34th place (out of 41), nobody noticed. It was the only tournament he would play before entering the World Series of Poker a few months later. In May 1980, he won the WSOP Main Event becoming the youngest player in that tournament's short history."

        "title": "Mark Sanford (basketball)",
        "text": "Eumarkjah Tywan \"Mark\" Sanford (born February 7, 1976), is a retired American professional basketball player.\nPersonal life.\nSanford was born in Dallas, Texas, to Beverley and Richard Sanford. He is the second oldest of five children, Richard, Anthony, Zakirah, and Crystal. In his early years he was a big football fan. He played and was coached by his father Richard until his untimely murder in 1990. Richard Sanford never saw his son play basketball. When he died, Mark was 14 years old, stood 5 feet 8 inches and played football. Mark told his father that he would play in the NFL, but in his heart - even back then - he felt he would never leave the impoverished neighborhood of South Oak Cliff, in Dallas, Texas. In the year following his father's death, Mark grew 8 inches, going from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet 6 inches. He stopped growing at 6 feet 10 inches.\nHigh school career.\nSanford attended Dallas Carter High School and did not start playing basketball until he was in the tenth grade. In his first year of playing organized basketball Sanford won a share of the Sophomore of the Year award with Maceo Baston of Spruce High School. Halfway through his junior year, he transferred to Carter's cross town rival Kimball High School. That year he led Kimball to an undefeated record the second half of the season while averaging 26ppg 14rebs and 4blk. Their only loss came in the Championship game to Waco High School. Kimball finished the season ranked number 6 in the Southwest.\nThe summer after Sanford's junior year his mother moved him to San Diego California, where he enrolled into Lincoln High School. He led Lincoln Prep to the city of San Diego's first ever State Championship.[2] Along the way he collected numerous honors from California State POY to All-State and All-American. He ranked 22nd nationally by Parade All-America in the class of 1994. Sanford was voted the MVP of the San Diego City All-Star Challenge after managing a record 10 3pts on 13 attempts and amassing 48pts. In 1996 He was inducted into the San Diego Sports Hall of fame. In his brief High School Career he scored 2,373 points, grabbed 1059 rebounds, and 413 blocks.\nCollege career.\nAt the University of Washington, Sanford played for the Washington Huskies.[1] He played three seasons with the team before he entered the 1997 NBA draft. Originally, Sanford had intended to declare for the 1996 NBA draft, but he withdrew his name from consideration. He played a total of 82 games for the Huskies scoring 1319 career point.\nIt did not take Sanford long to get into the Husky record books by scoring 15 points as a true Freshman in the 1st game/start of his career. In doing so he amassed the most points ever by a player in their 1st game. He was the fastest Husky to score 500 points doing so in just 32 games. He amassed 27 career 20+ point games and scored his career high of 35 points twice against USC and Jackson State, both during his sophomore year.\nSanford led the huskies in both scoring and rebounding in his Sophomore and Junior seasons. In his true Freshman year, he led all Pac-10 Freshman in scoring and rebounding with 14.5ppg, 5.7rpg. After his Freshman year he was invited to try out for the Under 19 Junior World Games in Athens, Greece. At the trials amongst other notable player such as Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, Kerry Kittles, Vince Carter, Stephon Marbury, Tim Duncan, and Marcus Camby, Sanford finished in the top 3 in 5 statistical categories (1st-scoring, 1st-steals, 2nd blocks, 2nd-FGP, 3rd-rebounds) becoming the first player to rank as high since Charles Barkley who finished number 1 in the same five categories.\nHe is the first player to ever leave the University of Washington early for the NBA draft. He was ranked 13th on Washington's all-time scoring list after only 3 seasons and 82 games played. He was Washington's most recognizable Husky since Detlef Schrempf. He was the Huskies' Shawn Kemp - a crowd-pleasing, high-flying dunker capable of bringing fans out of their homes on a rainy December evening and into Edmundson Pavilion.\nDuring Sanford's tenure at Washington, season-ticket sales increased nearly 11.8 percent. Prior to his sophomore season, Washington sold 3,261 men's season tickets. His junior season, 3,701 were sold. Twelve Washington games appeared on cable television, while two aired on network TV. The Huskies sold-out home crowds against top-ranked Cincinnati, No. 11 Arizona and No. 13 UCLA.\nWhen asked about the support and exposure for the program Sanford stated, \"We've finally got the exposure this year after years when nobody cared too much about Washington basketball.\" He went on to say, \"Now that we got the exposure and expectations, we need to win.\"\nFor his career he was a two-time first-team All-Pac-10 selection and first-team All-Freshman. He was also an All-American selection following his Junior year. He's scored 1,000 points faster than any other Washington player, but his place in UW history is largely unknown. When his career ended, he became widely remembered for his role in reviving Husky men's basketball. With one step he was known to have a 41-inch leap, able to reach as high as 12 feet 4 inches.\nHarlem Globetrotters.\nIn 1999, during the strike-shortened NBA lockout season, Sanford opted to join the Harlem Globetrotters. For his jumping ability, he earned the nickname \"Airplane\".\nNBA.\nSanford was projected to be drafted as high as #11 to the Sacramento Kings in the 1997 NBA draft. Former Sacramento Kings Head Coach Eddie Jordan said that he thought that Sanford was the best defender in college basketball and compared him offensively to Billy Owens. After putting Sanford through a workout, former Indiana Pacers Head Coach Larry Bird stated that he thought that \"Mark Sanford was the most athletic and skilled player that he had seen enter the draft in the last 5 years\". Bird also declared that, had Sanford stayed in school for his senior season, he would have been projected as a top-3 draft pick.\nSanford would later watched his stock plummet in the days prior to the draft after being involved in an confrontation with his then agent. As a result of the confrontation, questions about his character arose and he was eventually selected with the second pick in the second round (30th overall) by the Miami Heat. He signed a guaranteed contract in July for the 1997–98 season. Two weeks before training camp began Sanford tore his plantar fascias. After failing to play through the injury with the Miami Heat, he was released following training camp.[3]\nIn 1999, he signed a league minimum contract with the Sacramento Kings going by his middle name Tywan. He suffered another injury in training camp and was released upon his return. In 2002 Sanford re-entered the NBA with the New Jersey Nets on another non-guaranteed contract after turning down two other non-guaranteed offers in previous years with Utah and New Jersey. He sustained another injury and left the NBA for good after his recovery midway through the season.[4] Although his NBA career ended without ever playing in a regular season game. He did go on to have a strong international playing career.\nInternational.\nSanford was a somewhat obscure player for most of his career but he was regarded as one of the best international players ever at the height of his career. In 2001 Sanford received an offer to play for Frankfurt of the Euroleague a week after he signed a contract to play in Japan. At 6'10, 220 lbs he was the fastest, most athletic, and most talented player on the floor on most nights. His four International Championships and seven international finals appearances are a testament to his abilities and the match-up problems that they caused. He possessed the speed of a point guard, the shooting ability of a prominent shooting guard, superior athleticism, and the ability to post on the block. He did a lot of his damage from the mid post taking advantage of his mid-range jumper and quick first step to beat defenders to the rim or creating space to get off one of his silky smooth jumpers. Sanford has played basketball internationally for several clubs outside the US, including France, Belgium, Spain, the Philippines, Japan, and Australia, in which he played for the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League (Australia). Most everyone that watched him play knows that he had the talent but believes that his attitude and his decision making off the court kept him from being a star in the NBA. At times he was a very difficult player to coach.\nHis career scoring and rebounding averages in Europe and Asia combined are 24.4 points and 11.2 rebounds. He has helped four teams win the Championship while failing in three other attempts.\nFor his international career he has twenty-two 40+ point games and three games of more than 50 points with a career high of 57. Over a six-year period he had at least one game in which he scored 40+ points. That streak expanded over nine different countries. He once scored 41 points in three quarters of a game while making 10 of 11 from three-point range and had another game in which he scored 51 points in 36 minutes. In another game he scored 32 straight points for his team expanding over two quarters finishing with 47 points. Because of his shooting ability he had numerous 30+ points game in which he did not attempt a single free throw.\nCollege Coaching Career.\nSanford begun his coaching career in 2009 as a volunteer Assistant Coach for the 13th-ranked Men's team at Northwood University (Florida Campus) under legendary Hall of Fame head coach Rollie Massimino. That year Coach Massimino put Sanford in charge of strength &amp; conditioning and player development. He also assisted in breaking down game film on their opponents and game planning. In his second year at Northwood Sanford became a full-time assistant coach. He took on more duties as the Seahawks shot to #1 in the country going 27–3 in the regular season. The 2010-11 Seahawks would finish the postseason ranked #2 with a 32–4 record and a loss in the final 4. One player would be named Player Of The Year while two players were named to the All-America team.\nIn 2011 Sanford was named the Head Women's Basketball Coach at Northwood University (Florida Campus). After taking over a program with a record of 4-26 and that finished last in The Sun Conference with a 1–13 record, in Sanford's two seasons at Northwood he compiled a win–loss record of 25–33. His Sun Conference record in two seasons was an impressive 18–10. The Seahawks finished in 3rd place in the two seasons that Sanford was named head coach. His up-tempo fast breaking and full-court pressing and trapping system saw 4 different players at 4 different positions be named to the Sun Conference All-Conference team, with 2 of the 4 players also being named Sun Conference Newcomer of the year in consecutive seasons. One of the 2 newcomers was also named Sun Conference Defensive Player of the Year after ranking in the top 5 nationally in steals. His teams would also see two different PG's in consecutive seasons lead the conference in assist and two different players in consecutive seasons lead the conference in steals.\nNBA Coaching Career.\nIn 2013 Sanford allowed for the Memphis Grizzlies to created the position of Player Development Coach when he accepted an offer from Head Coach Dave Joeger to join his coaching staff. He accepted the position of Lead Player Development Coach and Assistant Video Coordinator.\nDuring his 3 years with the Grizzlies he served many positions. Along with Player Development and Assistant Video Coordinator he also worked as a College Scout, Pro Personnel Scout, NBA Draft Evaluation, and Advanced Scout."

This was the second tour of Australia by an English team, the first having been in 1861–62, and the first to visit New Zealand. Like the 1859 team in North America, this team is sometimes referred to as George Parr's XI.\nSquad.\nThe team was captained by George Parr (Nottinghamshire) who was joined by William Caffyn, Julius Caesar, Tom Lockyer, (all Surrey); Alfred Clarke, Cris Tinley, John Jackson (all Nottinghamshire); George Tarrant, Robert Carpenter, Thomas Hayward (all Cambridgeshire); George Anderson (Yorkshire); and E. M. Grace (amateur; West Gloucestershire CC). Grace was the sole amateur in the party, all the other players being professionals.\nTour.\nThe first match started on 1 January 1864 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the last ended on 24 April, also at the MCG. Parr's team played 14 matches in Victoria and New South Wales but only one is recognised as a first-class fixture. They also played five matches in the South Island of New Zealand during February.\nThe first-class match was held at the MCG in March. The two teams combined the tourists and local players on each side: in a close match G. Anderson's XI beat G. Parr's XI by four wickets."
