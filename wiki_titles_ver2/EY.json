It was head coach Trent May's seventh season at Grand Canyon. The Antelopes competed as new members of the Western Athletic Conference and played their home games at GCU Arena. This was year 1 of a four-year transition period from D2 to Division I. As a result, the Antelopes were classified as a D2 team for the 2013–14 season. The Antelopes weren't eligible to make the D1 or D2 basketball tournaments and did not participate in this season's WAC basketball tournament. However the Antelopes could have competed in the WNIT or WBI tournaments if they were invited. The Antelopes finished the season third in the WAC and were invited to participate in the WBI.\nSchedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#522D80; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\"| 2014 WBI\nSee also.\n2013–14 Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball team"

        "title": "Sailing ship effect",
        "text": "The sailing ship effect is a phenomenon by which the introduction of a new technology to a market accelerates the innovation of an incumbent technology. Despite the fact that the term was coined by W.H. Ward in 1967 the concept was made clear much earlier in a book by S.C. Gilfillan entitled “\"Inventing the ship\"” published in 1935. The name of the “effect” is due to the reference to advances made in sailing ships in the second half of the 1800s in response to the introduction of steamships. According to Ward, in the 50 years after the introduction of the steam ship, sailing ships made more improvements than they had in the previous 300 years. The term “Sailing Ship Effect” applies to situations in which an old technology is revitalized, experiencing a “last gasp” when faced with the risk of being replaced by a newer technology.\nHere is how Gilfillan put it:\n”It is paradoxical, but on examination logical, that this noble flowering of the sailing ship, this apotheosis during her decline and just before extermination, was partly vouchsafed by her supplanter, the steamer.” (Gilfillan, 1935, p. 156).\nThis effect is the economic version of a phenomenon in biology called the red queen effect. The sailing ship effect has attracted attention as a paradigm for the ecological transition of the energetic systems, especially in the automotive field.\nCauses.\nThree possible explanations have been suggested as the cause of the Sailing Ship Effect:\nControversy.\nIn 2005, the validity of the original example of the sailing ship effect was called into doubt. In a paper entitled \"The Response of Old Technology Incumbents to Technological Competition: Does the Sailing Ship Effect Exist?\" author John Howells contends that sailing ships and steamships serviced different market segments in the 1860s and 1870s and, therefore, were not directly competing technologies. Howells goes on to hypothesize that rapid advancements in sailing technology of that era may have arisen from competition between sailing ship firms. The paper goes on to call into doubt the prevalence of the phenomenon. \nOn to the other hand, De Liso and Filatrella, while providing a review of the literature which confirms the existence of the sailing ship effect, provide a mathematical model which can simulate the sailing ship effect. A recent paper by Sandro Mendonca argues that \"The modernization of the sailing trader occurs before, not after, the steamship had become an effective competitor\", and further cautions \"if history is to be used to give credence to explanations of empirical regularities in a variety of settings in the original source of the relevant concepts must be carefully revisited and deeply researched\".

It included 17 events including Qatar, Thailand, Brazil, Italy, The Netherlands, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Belgium and Mexico.\nIn the premier MXGP class, Tony Cairoli won his sixth consecutive championship title, matching the previous record set by Stefan Everts between 2001 and 2006. Cairoli, riding a KTM, won a total of 9 rounds and 15 races en route to the title, finishing 119 points clear of his nearest rival, Jeremy Van Horebeek, riding a Yamaha. In his second season at MXGP level, Van Horebeek achieved his maiden race victory at Loket in the Czech Republic, and also took his first round win in the process. Third place in the final championship standings went to Suzuki's Kevin Strijbos, who won the other race at Loket. Fourth place went to another Suzuki rider, Clément Desalle, who won four rounds and seven races, but due to an injury suffered at Uddevalla, he missed four of the last five rounds. Other riders to take round victories were Gautier Paulin – book-ending the season with victories in the season-opening and season-closing rounds – and Maximilian Nagl, while both riders each won five races.\nIn MX2, the season was dominated by the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team, and in particular, two-time defending champion Jeffrey Herlings. Herlings won 12 of the first 13 rounds to be held during the season, and 22 of the 26 races including a streak of 18 consecutive victories; after Hyvinkää, Herlings was 145 points clear of team-mate Jordi Tixier, with only 200 points available at the final 4 rounds. However, while competing in a charity event between events, Herlings crashed and suffered a broken femur. He was unable to compete in the next three rounds, where Tixier took a round win and two victories; he never finished lower than fourth in the six-race run. Herlings' advantage was reduced to 23 points, but he elected to compete in the final round in Mexico. However, he could do no better than tenth in either race, with Tixier taking a win and a third place – winning the round in the process – to take his first world title, by just four points. The top three placings were completed by Romain Febvre, who achieved a race and round win in Goiânia. Max Anstie and Arnaud Tonus were the only other riders to take round wins – each winning one race – while race victories were also taken by Glenn Coldenhoff (two wins), Tim Gajser (two wins), Dylan Ferrandis and Christophe Charlier.\nRace calendar and results.\nOriginally scheduled for 17 August as the sixteenth round of the championship, the Ukrainian GP was postponed in April due to pro-Russian unrest in the country."

        "text": "Caberfae Peaks ( ) is a downhill ski area located in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan near Cadillac, Michigan. It gets its name from the Gaelic word for \"stag's head\".\nHistory.\nCaberfae Peaks' official opening was in January, 1938, making it one of the oldest ski resorts in the US. The resort opened with a lodge built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and one ski trail named \"Number One\". The first rope tow was powered by a Ford Model A car engine. Over the next five years, a dozen more trails were cleared and several rope tows were installed. It closed after the 1942–43 season and didn't open again until after the end of World War II.\nWith its ten-year head-start on Boyne Mountain, Caberfae became Michigan's largest winter sports area by the mid-1950s. Regularly scheduled \"snow trains\" brought thousands of skiers to the area, with daily crowds sometimes exceeding 4000. A snowmaking system was installed in 1957.\nThe resort continued to expand throughout the 1960s, adding trails and lifts to bring the count up to 35 trails serviced by 20 lifts. However, poor snow during the 1965 and 1966 holiday periods caused financial difficulties for the operation and the resort was sold to a private company in 1967. Prior to this it had been managed as a non-profit.\nThe resort struggled financially throughout the 70s. New owners in 1980 began expanding the resort, bringing in fill dirt to raise the summit of the North Peak and opening the South Peak. The South Peak opened in 1983 and the North Peak expansion was completed in 1992, increasing the vertical drop to 485'. Meanwhile, many of the trails cleared in the 50s and 60s were abandoned and most of the rope tows removed.\nFor the 2013–2014 season, Caberfae opened 25 acres of gladed terrain off the North Peak.\nWinter activities.\nThe area offers cross-country skiing and alpine skiing. Snowshoeing, ice skating, and snowmobiling are available nearby.\nSummer activities.\nGolf.\nThe 9 hole regulation length golf course opened in 1995."

Their notable elite gymnasts are 2012 Olympic Champion McKayla Maroney, 2010 World Team Member Mattie Larson and Stanford Cardinal Samantha Shapiro.\nHistory.\nAOGC is owned by former Olympic gymnast Galina Marinova and World Champion/Olympian Artur Akopyan. The Hawthorne, California, location was used to train actors from the 2006 gymnastics movie \"Stick It\".\nIn 2010, AOGC had a new member, Junior elite gymnast McKayla Maroney transferred from Gym-Max Gymnastics in Costa Mesa. McKayla competed at the U.S Nationals, placing 3rd in the all-around and winning the Vault. Mattie Larson won the floor at the U.S Nationals and was named to the U.S 2010 World Gymnastics Championships team. \nIn 2011, Samantha Shapiro ended her elite career, going into Collegiate gymnastics, for UCLA and Stanford. Meanwhile, Maroney was named to the U.S Worlds Squad. She took the team gold and also won the World title on the Vault.\nIn 2012, McKayla was named to the U.S Olympic Squad. Injured in the leadup to the Olympics, Maroney competed only on her best event, vault. She competed a near-flawless vault during team finals and later won the silver medal on vault.\nIn 2013, Maroney took the U.S National titles on Floor and Vault and was later named to the 2013 Worlds Squad. She won a gold medal for vault.\nSex abuse involvement and location closure.\nAOGC was \"at the center\" of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal with AOGC, Akopya, and Marinova involved in multiple lawsuits. Both Maroney and Larson, while members of AOGC, were abused by Larry Nassar when with the United States women's national artistic gymnastics team. AOGC reached a settlement with Larson in June 2018 for $1 million and in November 2018 closed its Hawthorne, California, location."

        "title": "Bowling (solitaire)",
        "text": "Bowling Solitaire is a patience or solitaire card game that uses a single deck standard playing cards to simulate a round of ten-pin bowling. \nTwo completely different games of Bowling Solitaire were created independently of each other. One was published in the book \"A Gamut of Games\" by Sid Sackson in 1969. The other was featured in a computer game by Sierra Online in 1988.\nSid Sackson's Bowling Solitaire (1969).\nThis solitaire game was designed by Sid Sackson, and published in his book \"A Gamut of Games\" (1969). Sackson wrote that he created the game because of his distaste for traditional solitaire games \"in which a red 9 is placed on a black 10\". Besides being popular with modern hobby gamers, Bowling Solitaire has been published as a separate game, and has also been implemented with a digital port.\nRules.\nSetup: Bowling Solitaire uses the Ace through 10 from two suits. From a shuffled pile of these 20 cards, ten cards representing the \"pins\" are randomly placed face-up in the same pattern as the pins are arranged for a normal game of ten pin bowling. Three \"bowling ball\" piles of face-down cards (five, three, and two cards respectively) are also dealt.\nGame-play: The top card of all bowling ball piles is turned face up, one of which is selected to \"bowl\" at the ten face-up pins. A single pin card can be removed if it matches the number on this ball card. Alternatively two or three pin cards that are adjacent can be removed if the final digit of their total value corresponds to the value of the bowling ball card used. Some restrictions apply (e.g. you can't use the very first ball card played to knock over any pins in the back row; pins knocked over must be adjacent). \nThe next card in the bowling ball pile used is turned face up, and another of the three face-up bowling ball cards is used in the same manner, until no further plays are possible.\nScoring: Removing all ten pins in this way counts as a strike, and concludes the frame. If a strike is not achieved, the top cards from all the ball piles are discarded, and play continues by turning over new cards on each of the piles. This action represents using a second bowling ball. Successfully removing all ten pins with these new cards also concludes the frame and counts as a spare. In the event all ten pins are not knocked over with this continued play, and if no further moves are possible, the frame is concluded with the number of pins removed representing the number of pins knocked over. \nTo begin a new frame, the 20 cards are shuffled and the process is repeated. A complete game consists of ten such frames. Scoring otherwise works exactly the same as it does in actual ten pin bowling. \nVersions.\nAlthough Bowling Solitaire was created to be a solitaire game played with a standard deck of playing cards, its popularity led to a version with custom cards. This was published by Eagle-Gryphon Games in 2016, and was included along with their game \"Elevenses for One\". \nA digital port using Java was created by Timothy S. Adam.\nSierra Online's Bowling Solitaire (1988).\nThis solitaire game was designed by Warren Schwader and featured in the 1988 computer game \"Hoyle: Official Book of Games Vol 2: Solitaire\" by Sierra Online. It has subsequently been implemented on several websites and programs that implement digital versions of solitaire games. The object of the game is to try to fill as many Pins as possible for each of the ten frames. \nRules.\nSetup: Bowling has ten \"Pin Piles\". Two \"Ball Piles\" located below the deck can contain up to three cards each. The scoring frame is located either above or below the gameplay.\nGame-play: To begin playing, turn up one card at a time from the deck. The card turned up must be planted on one of the Pin Piles, or placed onto one of the Ball Piles. All the Pin Piles should be filled in order from lowest ranking cards (towards the bottom) to the highest ranking cards (towards the top right). There are only ten Pins, but there are thirteen ranks of cards. The difficult part of this game is anticipating what ranks will not be drawn from the Deck. \nHere is an example of a possible arrangement:\n 9 _ Q K\n 5 _ 7\n 2 4\n A\nOnly a ten or a Jack can be placed onto the empty Pin between the nine and Queen. Only a six can fill the empty space between the five and seven. Place multiple cards of the same rank into the same piles. If a three or an eight is drawn, they must be put in the Ball Pile because it cannot be placed with the Pins. \nScoring: Bowling Solitaire is scored the same way regular ten-pin bowling is scored. To get a strike, fill all the Pins before placing a card in the Ball Pile. To receive a spare, fill all Pins before placing cards into the second Ball Pile. Otherwise, points are scored by the amount of spaces filled before both Ball Piles are filled. After both Ball Piles have been filled with three cards each, that round of the game will end. The game consists of ten rounds."

        "title": "1942 Rugby by-election",
        "text": "The 1942 Rugby by-election was a parliamentary by-election for the British House of Commons constituency of Rugby on 29 April 1942.\nVacancy.\nThe by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Conservative MP, David Margesson in March 1942. He had been MP here since gaining the seat from the Liberal, Ernest Brown in 1924. Margesson had been Secretary of State for War until February 1942 when Winston Churchill sacked him following the fall of Singapore.\nElection history.\nRugby had been won by the Conservative Party at every election since 1924 and was a safe seat. The result at the last General election was as follows;\nCandidates.\nThe local Conservatives selected 56-year-old Lt-Col. Sir Claude Holbrook. He was a serving officer with the Royal Army Service Corps who had also served in the European War from 1914 to 1918. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Warwickshire in 1931. He had been Chairman of Rugby Conservative Association since 1927. He was Officer-in-Charge of a big Ordnance Depot.\nThe Labour party had selected A E Millett to contest a General Election expected to take place in 1939–40. He had fought Yeovil in 1935, coming third behind the Liberal. Although the General Election had not taken place because of the war, he had remained active for the Labour party in Rugby and was still officially their candidate. In accordance with the terms of the wartime electoral truce, Millett was not put forward by the Rugby Labour party.\nThe Liberals had not fought the constituency since 1929 and had no candidate in place. The Rugby Liberals had remained active through their chairman, M E Avery, but did not put forward a candidate.\nHowever, an Independent candidate did emerge to challenge the Conservatives, in the shape of 48-year-old William Brown. He had a history of going up against the party machines. Although he was elected Labour MP for Wolverhampton West in 1929 he had resigned from the party in 1930 along with Oswald Mosley when the Labour government failed to tackle unemployment. However, he did not join Mosley's New Party and instead continued in parliament as an Independent Labour member. Under that label, he was defeated in the 1931 elections even though no official Labour candidate opposed him. By the 1935 elections, the Wolverhampton West Labour party did oppose him but did very poorly, while Brown came second standing as an Independent. Brown did however have a political power-base, having been General Secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association since he founded the organisation in 1921. The union had been affiliated to the Labour party until the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 was passed following the General Strike of 1926.\nCampaign.\nPolling day was set for 29 April 1942. When nominations closed, it was to reveal a two horse race, the Conservative local man, Holbrook, against the Independent outsider, Brown. Holbrook demonstrated what he thought about the situation by stating that the electors of the division were against holding an election.\nBrown chose as his election agent, another outsider in Reg Hipwell who was a Services Journalist and had himself fought the 1941 Hampstead by-election as an Independent candidate.\nOn 14 April 1942 Brown's 6 point policy plan was released in the Birmingham Post;\n1. Total efficiency in total war effort.\n2. Reconstitution of the Government on a non-party basis.\n3. Breaking through the contradictions in production, the Civil Service, politics and propaganda, which hinder the war effort.\n4. Maintenance of the freedom of the public Press and of public criticism against the growing tendency of the Government towards suppression.\n5. Democratisation of the Army.\n6. Real equality of sacrifice.\nAt the start of the campaign Holbrook was sharply criticised by a Magistrate in open Court for being very unhelpful to the police, who had been trying to enquire into thefts from the Ordnance Depot of which he was the Officer-in-Charge. The case had been widely reported in the Press. Brown telegraphed Prime Minister Winston Churchill drawing attention to the reports asking if Churchill proposed to send a letter commending Holbrook to the electors of Rugby. Churchill did not reply but did as Brown had expected.\nAs was usual, Holbrook received a joint letter of endorsement from all the leaders of the parties in the coalition. One of these signatories was Ernest Brown the leader of the Liberal Nationals, who had been the MP in the constituency until defeated by Margesson in 1924.\nThe Rugby Labour party was split over Brown's candidature. Some members wanted to support him because he was a leading trade unionist and easily to the left of Holbrook, while others felt that it was important to follow the party leader, Clement Attlee, who had endorsed Holbrook. The National Council of Labour passed a resolution condemning Brown as a disruptive individual, not a fit and proper person to represent the working classes.\nHolbrook lost his temper and made some very damaging statements about Brown, which seemed to gain Brown public sympathy. Embarrassed by Brown's telegram to Churchill, which had become front-page news, he issued a writ of libel against Brown. This ensured that Brown would be kept quiet on further raising issues in connection with the depot. Holbrook was to later drop the case and paid all costs.\nCampaign slogans played their part; the Conservative campaign for Holbrook - \"Vote for Holbrook, the man whom Churchill wants\". The Brown campaign countered this with \"Vote for Brown, the man whom Churchill needs!\"\nThe issue of the Second Front in Europe came to the fore late in the campaign. Holbrook's position was that it was too soon to establish it. This upset the local Communist party, who had been instructed by their headquarters in London to call on their supporters to vote for Holbrook as the best way of getting it. Brown belatedly came out in support of the Second Front. The retired Rugby Conservative MP, David Margesson warned voters that Adolf Hitler would gloat if Brown got in.\nOn the eve of poll, Holbrook wrote an article for the local press entitled \"Why I Won\".\nResult.\nHolbrook had been premature with his article for the papers as he lost. \nAftermath.\nIn 1945, free from the restrictions of the electoral truce, the Labour party fielded a candidate against Brown and finished last. Brown held onto his seat, the result at the following General election;"

        "text": "The 2014 end-of-year rugby tests, also known as the 2014 autumn internationals in the Northern Hemisphere, were international rugby union matches predominantly played between visiting Southern Hemisphere countries and European nations.\nBrazil, Canada, Germany, Georgia, Hong Kong, Japan, Namibia, Paraguay, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the United States and Uruguay A all played at least one test match during the three-week international window.\nWithin the window, the three Pacific Island teams faced Tier 1 opposition, when Wales and France hosted Fiji, and England and Italy hosted Samoa. At the time, Italy entered the Samoa test on the back of nine consecutive losses and a 15–0 loss to Samoa in Apia in June 2014. Scotland became the first Tier 1 nation to play a Test match on a fully artificial pitch when they hosted Tonga at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, winning 37–12.\nGeorgia had a rare opportunity to play a Tier 1 nation in Ireland, who played The Lelos for the first time since their Pool D fixture in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Ireland became the first Tier 1 nation to play Georgia since Argentina in June 2013, and the first Six Nations team to host a European Nations Cup team since Scotland's 48–6 win over Romania during the 2006 Autumn Internationals.\nThe United States played host to New Zealand for the first time since 1980, though that was not an official test match. Therefore, this was the first official test match between the two in America since 1913, when the All Blacks were 51–3 victors, and the last meeting between the two nations took place during the 1991 Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks won the game 74–6 in front of a sell-out crowd at Soldier Field.\nHistory was made in Hong Kong, when a first-ever meeting between Hong Kong and Russia took place, and in Windhoek with a first-ever meeting between Germany and Namibia on Namibian soil.\nArgentina visited Scotland, Italy and France, as they tried to build upon their first Rugby Championship win. Australia traveled to Wales, Ireland, England and France, who they had beaten 3–0 in their 2014 June Test series. New Zealand played Scotland, Wales and England, who had lost 3–0 to the All Blacks in their June Test series, while South Africa competed against Ireland, England, Wales and Italy.\nFollowing a reduced 2014 IRB Pacific Nations Cup, the IRB organized matches between the Pacific island countries and North American teams at neutral venues in Europe; Tonga and Fiji played the United States, while Samoa played Canada. In addition to those, Romania hosted both Canada and the United States, while Romania and Georgia hosted Japan. Georgia also hosted Tonga for just their third meeting, the first since 1999.\nFollowing the qualification of Namibia for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, an IRB–funded tour allowed Namibia to test themselves against higher ranked opposition; they played Canada in Colwyn Bay and Portugal in Lisbon. In preparation for a big year in Brazilian sport ahead of the introduction of Rugby sevens into the Olympic Games, Brazil hosted Uruguay and Paraguay to broaden their depth in the sport before their automatic participation in the 2016 competition.\nLike in recent seasons, New Zealand and Australia played the third and final Bledisloe Cup Test match for the year, with New Zealand winning 29–28 with a last-minute try.\nMatches.\nOctober.\nNotes:\nNotes:\n1 November.\nNotes: \nNotes:\n7/8 November.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n14/15/16 November.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n21/22/23 November.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\n29 November.\nNotes:\nNotes:"

The country's participation in the games marks the first time a figure skater from Southeast Asia competed in the Games.\nBackground.\nThe Philippine delegation to the 2014 Winter Olympics consisted of one athlete in figure skating. The country competed at the Winter Olympics for the first time since 1992 Winter Olympics and 4th time overall. At least three Filipino-Ameticans athletes made failed attempts to qualify for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada\nnamely the figure skating pair composed of Michael Dimalanta and Gracielle Jeanne Tan and snowboarder Eden Serina.\nThe sole competitor for the country was Michael Christian Martinez, who is also the first South East Asian figure skater to qualify for the games. Martinez served as the flag bearer for the Philippines in the opening ceremony, while a volunteer served as flag bearer in the closing ceremony.\nAudrey Alcaraz, another Filipino figure skater made a non-competitive performance in the closing ceremony during the handover of hosting duties of the Winter Olympics to Pyeongchang, South Korea, the host city of the 2018 Winter Olympics\nFigure skating.\nThe Philippines has achieved the following quota place:\nMichael Christian Martinez secured qualification by finishing 7th in the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany.\nIn the short program, Martinez was the fifth athlete to perform in the men's singles competition which featured 29 other figure skaters from 21 NOCs. He performed to the tune of the \"Love Theme from \"Romeo and Juliet\"\". He managed to make a triple Axel, inverted camel and triple loops without landing issues and finished his performance with a Biellmann spin. He is among the 24 figure skaters who advanced to the free skate after he finished 19th with 64.81 points.\nIn the free skate, Martinez skated to the tune of \"Malagueña\" by Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona. The third athlete to perform in the final routine, Martinez garnered 199.44 points. Among the elements he performed were triple Axels, triple double toes, and double flip. However he landed on his right hand following an execution of a triple loop. Like in the short program, he ended his free skate with a Biellmann spin.\nMartinez finished the competition in 19th place (out of 30 skaters), meaning with a single athlete competing in a single event, The Philippines did not win a medal at these Games."

        "text": "The 2003–04 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2003–04 NCAA Division I college basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by Craig Esherick and played their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC. The Hoyas were members of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 13-15, 4-12 in Big East play. They lost to Boston College in the first round of the 2004 Big East men's basketball tournament and had no further postseason play. It was the first time since the 1973-74 season that Georgetown did not receive an invitation to either the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament or the National Invitation Tournament.\nSeason Recap.\nSenior forward and team co-captain Gerald Riley started all 28 games, completing his string of starting all 125 games of his collegiate career. With power forward Mike Sweetney having left the team over the offseason, choosing to forgo his senior year to enter the National Basketball Association draft, Riley became the teams offensive centerpiece, and he averaged 33 minutes a game for the year. He put in a strong performance early in the season as the team won its first ten games. Sophomore forward Brandon Bowman, meanwhile, also started all 28 games – as he would all 127 games of his collegiate career – and averaged 34 minutes per game. He scored in double figures 24 times and led the team in scoring 12 times. He also led the team in rebounding 20 times.\nSophomore guard Ashanti Cook became a starter this season, starting all 28 games, as he would every game for the rest of his collegiate career. He scored a season-high 18 points against Connecticut and his 106 assists for the year were twice as many as anyone else on the team. He shot 34.4 percent from the field and only 31.9 percent from three-point range, but averaged 9.2 points per game. Junior forward Darrel Owens started the season strong, averaging in double figures in early games and scoring 20 points against Boston College. He also had ten or more rebounds in two games.\nThe team opened the season 10-0, including a victory over Rutgers in the Big East opener, but it sorely missed the departed Sweetney and won only three more games as virtually the entire team slumped. Riley excelled in the two victories over Miami, scoring 35 points at Miami and then 37 points against the Hurricanes a week later at the MCI Center, the most points scored by a Georgetown forward in a single game since 1965. In the two Miami games combined, he shot 25-for-32 (78.1%) from the field and a perfect 16-for-16 from the free-throw line. Otherwise, however, his numbers went into decline as the teams fortunes fell. Owens also saw his performance drop; during Georgetowns season-ending nine-game losing streak, he never scored in double figures and averaged only 4.5 points per game. Among Hoya players, only Bowman did not slump. He led the team in rebounds in 15 of the last 17 games of the year. Though he also struggled at the onset of the nine-game losing streak, he shot 46 percent from the field during the final four games of the season compared to 31 percent for the rest of the team. The team averaged 52 points a game during its last four games, and Bowman was responsible for a third of them.\nLosing 14 of the final 17 games of the regular season, the team finished the regular season at 13-14 overall and 4-12 in the Big East – the worst conference record it ever had in the 34-season history of the original Big East Conference – and tied for 12th place. It went into the 2004 Big East tournament with an eight-game losing streak and lost in the first round to Boston College. The tournament loss extended the teams losing streak to nine games, tying the school record for the most games lost in a row set by the hapless 3-23 team of 1971-72.\nThe teams 13-15 final record was the first losing record for a Georgetown team since the 1998-99 team went 15-16 and only the second since the 1972-73 team posted a 12-14 record. With no postseason play, Georgetown missed the NCAA tournament for the third year in a row and for the sixth time in seven years. Although the 2001-02 team had no postseason play after Esherick declined an invitation to the 2002 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), the 2003-04 team was the first Georgetown squad to receive no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the NIT since 1973-74.\nEsherick fired.\nCraig Esherick – a former Georgetown player who had served as a Hoyas assistant coach for 17½ seasons before succeeding John Thompson, Jr., as head coach in January 1999 – had posted a 103-74 (.582) record during his 5½ seasons as head coach. At the end of the 2002-2003 season, Georgetown had extended his contract through 2009. He indicated to the press late in the 2003-2004 season that his position as head coach was secure, that he had a good recruiting class joining the team for the 2004-2005 season – it included future stars Jeff Green, Roy Hibbert, and Jonathan Wallace – and that they should \"stay tuned,\" and Georgetown president John DeGioia gave him a public show of support around the same time. On March 5, 2004, Esherick said, \"I ain't going anywhere – I may be here for another 30 years.\"\nHowever, after only one NCAA Tournament appearance during Esherick′s tenure, three consecutive seasons without an NCAA Tournament appearance, and a sub-.500 performance in 2003-04 that ended with the record-tying losing streak, DeGioia fired Esherick on March 16, 2004, just six days after the end of the season. Assistant coaches Mike Riley, Jaren Jackson, and Chuck Driesell also left the team at the end of the season, Riley after 22 seasons as an assistant coach at Georgetown and the other two after a single season of coaching the Hoyas.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 25 in either the AP Poll or the Coaches' Poll at any time and was never among other teams receiving votes in either poll.\n2003–04 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament"

He was the head coach of St. Lawrence from 2016-2019, succeeding Greg Carvel who departed for UMass.\nCareer.\nMorris played four seasons (1981 – 1984) of professional hockey, mostly with the New Haven Nighthawks of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he scored 9 goals and 33 assists for 42 points, with 146 penalty minutes, in 156 AHL games played.\nFollowing his playing career, Morris turned to coaching and found his way to Clarkson. He became the Golden Knights most successful coach winning more games, regular season titles, tournament titles and reaching more NCAA tournaments than anyone in school history.\nIn November 2002, Morris was fired three games into the 2002-03 season following an on-ice incident with one of his own players. Clarkson president Denny Brown said that in light of both the incident and Morris' refusal to take part in an internal investigation that had taken place, Clarkson had no choice but to fire Morris immediately.\nIn professional hockey, Morris began his professional coaching career under Marc Crawford, serving from February 2003 to April 2003 as the Special Assistant Coach/Interim Strength and Conditioning Coach for the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL. Then, after a two-year stint at a prep school in Lake Placid, Morris landed a job with the Manchester Monarchs of the American Hockey League in 2006. He spent eight years as head coach, compiling a record of 339-223-67, making him the only coach in history with over 300 wins in both the college and professional ranks.\nIn 2016 Morris returned to the college game, taking over at St. Lawrence, which is less than 10 miles from Clarkson University, and attempted to try and continue the success he had in the 1990s. After a good first season Morris found himself mired in an NCAA investigation that alleged multiple serious rules violations but after three months he was cleared on all but one minor infraction. In his third season Morris posted the second-worst record in program history, including the most losses for any Saints team, and was unsurprisingly fired at the end of the postseason.\nHead coaching record.\nCollege.\n† Morris was fired mid-season\nReferences.\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/sports/college-hockey-coach-mark-morris-one-of-a-kind/"

        "title": "European Rugby Champions Cup",
        "text": "The European Rugby Champions Cup (known as the Investec Champions Cup for sponsorship reasons) is an annual rugby union tournament organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR). It is the top-tier competition for clubs who compete in a predominantly European league. Clubs qualify for the Champions Cup via their final positions in their respective national/regional leagues (English Premiership, French Top 14, and United Rugby Championship) or via winning the second-tier Challenge Cup; those that do not qualify are instead eligible to compete in the second-tier Challenge Cup.\nBetween 1995 and 2014, the equivalent competition was known as the Heineken Cup and was run by European Rugby Cup. Following disagreements between its shareholders over the structure and governance of the competition, it was taken over by EPCR and its name was changed to the European Rugby Champions Cup, without title sponsorship. Heineken returned as sponsor for the 2018–19 season, resulting in the competition being known as the Heineken Champions Cup. Although they are technically two separate competitions, run by different organisations, the European Rugby Cup and the European Rugby Champions Cup are recognised as one title chain of elite club championships in Europe, with teams that have won multiple titles ranked, for example, by the aggregate of their wins in both versions.\nFrench clubs have the highest number of victories (11 wins), followed by England (10 wins) and Ireland (7 wins). England has the largest number of winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by thirteen different clubs, eight of which have won it more than once, and five successfully defended their title including a unique three-in-a-row made by Toulon between 2012–13 and 2014–15. Toulouse is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 5 times, including the very first season of the tournament in the 1995–96 season. La Rochelle are the current European champions, having beaten Leinster 26–27 in the 2023 final in Dublin, Ireland.\nHistory.\nHeineken Cup.\n1995–1999.\nThe Heineken Cup was launched in the summer of 1995 on the initiative of the then Five Nations Committee to provide a new level of professional cross border competition. Twelve sides representing Ireland, Wales, Italy, Romania and France competed in four pools of three with the group winners going directly into the semi-finals. English and Scottish teams did not take part in the inaugural competition. From an inauspicious beginning in Romania, where Toulouse defeated Farul Constanţa 54–10 in front of a small crowd, the competition gathered momentum and crowds grew. Toulouse went on to become the first European cup winners, eventually beating Cardiff in extra time in front of a crowd of 21,800 at Cardiff Arms Park.\nClubs from England and Scotland joined the competition in 1996–97. European rugby was further expanded with the advent of the European Challenge Cup for teams that did not qualify for the Heineken Cup. The Heineken Cup now had 20 teams divided into four pools of five. Only Leicester and Brive reached the knock-out stages with 100 per cent records and ultimately made it to the final, Cardiff and Toulouse falling in the semi-finals. After 46 matches, Brive beat Leicester 28–9 in front of a crowd of 41,664 at Cardiff Arms Park, the match watched by an estimated television audience of 35 million in 86 countries.\nThe season 1997–98 saw the introduction of a home and away format in the pool games. The five pools of four teams, which guaranteed each team a minimum of six games, and the three quarter-final play-off matches all added up to a 70-match tournament. Brive reached the final again but were beaten late in the game by Bath with a penalty kick. Ironically, English clubs had decided to withdraw from the competition in a dispute over the way it was run.\nWithout English clubs, the 1998–99 tournament revolved around France, Italy and the Celtic nations. Sixteen teams took part in four pools of four. French clubs filled the top positions in three of the groups and for the fourth consecutive year a French club, in the shape of Colomiers from the Toulouse suburbs, reached the final. Despite this it was to be Ulster's year as they beat Toulouse (twice) and reigning French champions Stade Français on their way to the final at Lansdowne Road, Dublin. Ulster then carried home the trophy after a 21–6 win over Colomiers in front of a capacity 49,000 crowd.\n1999–2004.\nEnglish clubs returned in 1999–00. The pool stages were spread over three months to allow the competition to develop alongside the nations' own domestic competitions, and the knockout stages were scheduled to take the tournament into the early spring. For the first time clubs from four nations – England, Ireland, France and Wales – made it through to the semi-finals. Munster's defeat of Toulouse in Bordeaux ended France's record of having contested every final and Northampton Saints' victory over Llanelli made them the third English club to make it to the final. The competition was decided with a final between Munster and Northampton, with Northampton coming out on top by a single point to claim their first major honour.\nEngland supplied two of the 2000–01 semi-finalists – Leicester Tigers and Gloucester – with Munster and French champions Stade Français also reaching the last four. Both semi-finals were close, Munster going down by a point 16–15 to Stade Français in Lille and the Tigers beating Gloucester 19–15 at Vicarage Road, Watford. The final, at Parc des Princes, Paris, attracted a crowd of 44,000 and the result was in the balance right up until the final whistle, but Leicester walked off 34–30 winners.\nMunster reached the 2001–02 final with quarter-final and semi-final victories on French soil against Stade Français and Castres. Leicester pipped Llanelli in the last four, after the Scarlets had halted Leicester's 11-match Heineken Cup winning streak in the pool stages. A record crowd saw Leicester become the first side to successfully defend their title.\nFrom 2002, the European Challenge Cup winner now automatically qualified for the Heineken Cup. Toulouse's victory over French rivals Perpignan in 2003 meant that they joined Leicester as the only teams to win the title twice. Toulouse saw a 19-point half-time lead whittled away as the Catalans staged a dramatic comeback in a match in which the strong wind and showers played a major role, but Toulouse survived to win.\nIn 2003–04 the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) voted to create regions to play in the Celtic League and represent Wales in European competition. Henceforth, Wales entered regional sides rather than the club sides that had previously competed. English side London Wasps had earned their first final appearance by beating Munster 37–32 in a Dublin semi-final while Toulouse triumphed 19–11 in an all-French contest with Biarritz in a packed Stade Chaban-Delmas in Bordeaux. The 2004 final saw Wasps defeat defending champions Toulouse 27–20 at Twickenham to win the Heineken Cup for the first time. The match was widely hailed as one of the best finals. With extra time looming at 20–20, a late opportunist try by scrum half Rob Howley settled the contest.\n2005–2014.\nThe tenth Heineken Cup final saw the inaugural champions Toulouse battle with rising stars Stade Français when Murrayfield was the first Scottish venue to host the final. Fabien Galthié's Paris side led until two minutes from the end of normal time before Frédéric Michalak levelled the contest for Toulouse with his first penalty strike. He repeated this in the initial stages of extra time and then sealed his side's success with a superb opportunist drop-goal. Toulouse became the first team to win three Heineken Cup titles.\nIn 2006, Munster defeated Biarritz in the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, 23–19. It was third time lucky for the Irish provincial side, who had previously been denied the ultimate prize twice by Northampton and Leicester.\nThe 2006–07 Heineken Cup would be distributed to over 100 countries following Pitch International's securing of the rights. That season was the first time in the history of the competition that two teams went unbeaten in pool play, with both Llanelli Scarlets and Biarritz doing so. Biarritz went into their final match at Northampton Saints with a chance to become the first team ever to score bonus-point wins in all their pool matches, but were only able to score two of the four tries needed. Leicester defeated Llanelli Scarlets to move into the final at Twickenham, with the possibility of winning a Treble of championships on the cards, having already won the Anglo-Welsh Cup and the English Premiership. However, Wasps won the final 25 points to 9 in front of a tournament record 81,076 fans.\nDuring competition there was uncertainty over the future of the tournament after the 2006–07 season as French clubs had announced that they would not take part because of fixture congestion following the Rugby World Cup and an ongoing dispute between English clubs and the RFU. It was speculated that league two teams might compete the next season, the RFU saying \"If this situation is not resolved, the RFU owes it to the sport to keep this competition going...We have spoken to our FDR clubs, and if they want to compete we will support them.\". A subsequent meeting led to the announcement that the tournament would be played in 2007–08, with clubs from all the six nations. On 20 May it was announced that both French and English top-tier teams would be competing\nIn the 2008 final, Munster won the cup for their second time ever by beating Toulouse at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\nLeinster won the title in 2009 in their first ever final after beating Munster in the semi-final in front of a then world record Rugby Union club match attendance in Croke Park. They beat the Leicester Tigers in the final at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh. They also beat Harlequins 6–5 in the quarter-finals at Twickenham Stoop, in the famous Bloodgate scandal.\nIn the 2010 final, Toulouse defeated Biarritz Olympique in the Stade de France to claim their fourth title, a Heineken Cup record.\nThe 16th Heineken Cup tournament in 2011 resulted in an Irish province lifting the title for the fourth time in six years as Leinster recorded their second triumph in the competition. They defeated former multiple Heineken Cup winners Leicester and Toulouse in the quarter- and semi-finals. At the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, in front of 72,000 spectators, Leinster fought back from a 22–6 half-time deficit in the final against Northampton Saints, scoring 27 unanswered points in 26 second-half minutes, winning 33–22 in one of the tournament's greatest comebacks. Johnny Sexton won the man-of-the-match award, having scored 28 of Leinster's points total, which included two tries, three conversions, and four penalties.\nLeinster successfully defended their crown in 2012 at Twickenham, eclipsing fellow Irish province and former champions Ulster 42–14 to establish the highest Heineken Cup final winning margin. The performance broke a number of Heineken Cup Final records. Leinster became only the second team to win back-to-back titles, and the only team ever to win three championships in four years. In addition, the game had the highest attendance at a final (81,774), the highest number of tries (5) and points (42) scored by one team and the highest points difference (28).\nThe final edition of the tournament as constituted as the Heineken Cup was won for a second time by Toulon at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in May 2014.\nChampions Cup.\n2014–18.\nThe tournament began on 17 October 2014, with Harlequins playing Castres Olympique in the first ever Champions Cup game. Toulon retained their title, beating Clermont 24–18 in a repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final, thereby becoming the first club to win three European titles in a row.\nFollowing the November 2015 Paris attacks, all Round 1 games due to take place in France that weekend were called off, along with the Round 2 fixture between Stade Français and Munster. Rescheduling of some matches was difficult, partly caused by fixture congestion due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\nSaracens won their first title defeating Racing 92 in Lyon 21–9 in 2016 final and followed it up with their second in 2017, beating Clermont 28–17 in Edinburgh.\nIn 2017–18 season, Leinster overcame the \"pool of death\" consisting of Glasgow Warriors (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the Pro14), Montpellier (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the TOP 14) and Exeter (who finished the 2017–18 season top of the English Premiership), beating all three teams both home and away. Leinster went on to face the back to back Champions Saracens, dispatching a defeat at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, to set up a semi-final against reigning Pro12 champions Scarlets. Leinster defeated Scarlets to face Racing 92 in Champions Cup Final in Bilbao. Leinster defeated Racing 92 by a scoreline of 15–12, becoming only the second team in history to earn four European titles. Leinster also won the Pro14 title to become the first Pro14 side to win such a double of trophies.\nHeineken Champions Cup.\n2018–2020.\nSaracens won the 2018–19 competition, defeating defending champions Leinster 20–10 in the final. Saracens were in breach of the Premiership salary cap during this edition and the previous year, in which they qualified for the 2018–19 cup. However, the EPCR have confirmed that Premiership ruling will not affect the results of the Heineken Champions Cup for 2018–19 or previous years, stating: \"The Saracens decision is based on Gallagher Premiership Rugby regulations and does not affect the club's European record or current status in the Heineken Champions Cup.\" There were no Saracens representatives at the launch of the 2019–20 competition, held in Cardiff on 6 November 2019. EPCR released a statement saying they were \"disappointed to learn of Saracens' decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today's official 2019–20 season launch\".\n2020–2023.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020–21 competition took on a revised format. A similar, but revised 24 team format took place for 2021–22 and 2022-23.\nInvestec Champions Cup.\nOn 31 August 2023, Investec, a bank and wealth management company with operations in South Africa and Europe, and the European Professional Club Rugby announced Investec would take over as title sponsor of the competition.\nFormat.\nQualification.\nTypically, a total of 24 teams qualify for the competition, the same number as used to qualify for the Heineken Cup. At least 23 of the 24 teams qualify automatically based on position in their respective leagues. The winner of the Challenge Cup will earn a place regardless of league position.\nTeam distribution is typically:\n20th team qualification (-2020).\nUntil 2018–19, the final team each season qualified through a play-off competition between the best placed unqualified teams. \nCompetition.\nGroup stage.\nFor the pool stage teams are placed into pools via a draw. The teams are ranked based on domestic league performance the previous season, and arranged into four tiers. Teams are then drawn from the tiers into pools at random, with the restriction that no team will be drawn in the same pool as another team from the same league and tier.\nTeams will play two other teams in their pool from a different league twice, at home and away, and match points will be awarded depending on the result of each game, with teams receiving four points for a win, and two for a draw. Teams can also earn bonus points for scoring four or more tries and/or for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nFollowing the completion of the pool stage, 16 teams qualify for the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup with a further 6 of the remaining 8 dropping into the Challenge Cup.\nKnock-out stage.\nThe sixteen remaining teams are seeded from 1–16 based on performance in their respective pool. The round of 16 is played over two legs with each team playing both home and away. The quarter-finals are unbracketed, and follow the standard 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5 format, as found in the Heineken Cup.\nThe winners of the quarter-finals will contest the two semi-finals, Up to and including the 2014–15 season, matches and home country advantage were determined by a draw by EPCR.\nIn 2015–16, EPCR decided to put a new procedure in place. In lieu of the draw that used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that the fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\". Semi-final matches must have been played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.\nSince 2018–19, the higher-seeded team will have home country/venue advantage for each semi-final regardless of whether they won their quarter-final at home or on the road. The EPCR may now also use its discretion to allow semi-finals to be played at a qualified club's home venue.\nThe winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, which will be held in May each season.\n2020–present.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe the 2020–21 competition took on a revised format. In this edition, the teams were split up into two separate pools of 12, in which they would play four games against opponents from their pool, before the top four teams from each of the two pools advanced to the knockout stage, made up of two-legged quarterfinals, and a single legged semi-finals and final. However, due to the increasing spread of the virus, only two rounds were played before the competition was suspended, and instead the top eight teams from each of the two pools advanced to the knockout stage, with all matches being single-legged affairs.\nA similar format remained for 2021–22, with the top eight teams from each of the two pools advancing to the knockout stage, which featured a two-legged Round of 16 before a single-legged quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. The 2022-23 campaign will retain the same pool format, but, like 2020-21, all knockout stage games will be single-legged.\nRecords and statistics.\nPlayer records.\nNote that in the case of career statistics, only those clubs for which each player appeared in European Cup fixtures (i.e. Heineken Cup or Champions Cup) are listed.\nCareer records.\nGoals.\n\"The number of goals includes both penalties and conversions.\"\nEuropean Player of the Year.\nThe European Player of the Year award was introduced by ERC in 2010. Ronan O'Gara received the inaugural award, being recognised as the best player over the first 15 years of ERC tournaments. Following the creation of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the new organisers, EPCR, continued to award a Player of the Year accolade, with the first going to Clermont full-back Nick Abendanon. In the 2016/17 season it was announced that the award would change name to the Anthony Foley Memorial Award after the passing of Munster Head Coach. The first winner of this since the change in title was Saracens fly half Owen Farrell.\nSponsorship and suppliers.\nSponsors.\nDuring the creation of the Champions Cup, former organisers ERC had been criticised for \"failing to maximise the commercial potential\" of the Heineken Cup. New organisers EPCR pledged to move from a single title sponsor format to a Champions League-style partner system, with 2–3 primary partners projected for the inaugural tournament and 5 being the ultimate target. However, only Heineken agreed to sign up for the 2014–15 season, at a much reduced price from that which they had been paying previously.\nTrophy.\nThe European Rugby Champions Cup trophy was unveiled in October 2014.\nCrafted by Thomas Lyte, the trophy is made of mixed metals including sterling silver and 18ct gold plating. The cup is designed around the idea of the star representing European rugby, including the previous 19 seasons of European rugby, as the Heineken Cup.\nThe 13.5 kg, five-handled trophy, creates a star shape when viewed from the top, while when viewed from the side, the top of the trophy has a coronet effect, which designers said was to reflect the crowning of the Kings of Europe. The base of the trophy contains the crests of the 10 clubs that won the Heineken Cup, to further reinforce the link between the old and new European competitions\nMedia coverage.\nRadio partnerships:\nFor other territories without official broadcasters, Heineken Champions Cup games are available on EPCR's broadcast platform . Between seasons 2014–15 and 2017–18, EPCR was criticised for forcing British and Irish fans to subscribe to two pay-TV companies, both Sky Sports and BT Sport, if they wanted to follow their teams in the tournament.\nAttendance.\nThis lists the average attendances for each season's European Cup competition, as well as the total attendance and highest attendance for that season. The final is typically the most-attended match, as it is generally held in a larger stadium than any club's home venue.\nThe highest attended match of the 2002–03 competition was a quarter-final between Leinster and Biarritz before 46,000 fans at Lansdowne Road in Dublin.\nThe 2009 final held at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh was only the third most-attended match that season. The most-attended match was a semi-final between Irish rivals Leinster and Munster played in Croke Park in Dublin. The attendance of 82,208 set what was then a world record for a club match in the sport's history. Second on that season's list was a pool match between Stade Français and Harlequins that drew 76,569 to Stade de France in Paris (a venue that Stade Français has used for select home matches since 2005).\nWhile the 2010–11 tournament's highest attended match was unsurprisingly the final, the second-highest attended match was notable in that it was held in Spain. Perpignan hosted Toulon in a quarter-final before a sellout crowd of 55,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, Spain.\nControversies.\nDisagreements over structure &amp; governance.\nEnglish and French rugby union clubs had long held concerns over the format and structure of the Heineken Cup organised by European Rugby Cup (ERC), predominantly in relation to the distribution of funds and an imbalance in the qualification process. Some proposals had been made that, in future, rather than Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy each sending their top-placed teams in the Pro14 to the Heineken Cup, the top teams from the league as a whole should be sent, regardless of nationality. This founding principle was eventually conceded however, when it was agreed that the top-placed teams from the four should participate in the new European competition.\nIn June 2012, following that year's final, Premiership Rugby and the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), on behalf of the English and French clubs respectively, gave ERC two years' notice of withdrawing from the Heineken Cup and also the second-tier Challenge Cup competitions from the start of the 2014–15 season. Soon after, in September, Premiership Rugby announced a new four-year TV deal worth £152 million with BT Sport including rights for English clubs' European games - which had previously been the sole responsibility of ERC. ERC responded with claims that Premiership Rugby did not have the rights to a European tournament and announced a four-year deal with Sky Sports. The actions of Premiership Rugby were said to have \"thrown northern hemisphere rugby into disarray\".\nSubsequently, in September 2013, the English and French clubs announced their intention to organise their own tournament, to be named the Rugby Champions Cup, from 2014 to 2015 season onwards, and invited other European clubs, provinces, and regions to join them. The IRB (now World Rugby) stepped into the debate at the same time to announce its opposition to the creation of a breakaway tournament. In October 2013, Regional Rugby Wales, on behalf of the four Welsh regions, confirmed its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup. Negotiations for both a new Heineken Cup and Rugby Champions Cup were then ongoing.\nOn 10 April 2014, following almost two years of negotiations, a statement was released under the aegis of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) announcing that the nine stakeholders to the new competition, the six unions, and three umbrella club organisations (Premiership Rugby, LNR, and Regional Rugby Wales), had signed Heads of Agreement for the formation of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Rugby Challenge Cup and a new, third tournament, initially called the Qualifying Competition and now known as the European Rugby Continental Shield. On the same day, BT and Sky announced an agreement that divided coverage of the new European competitions. Both will split the pool matches, quarter-finals, and semi-finals equally, and both will broadcast the final. BT will get first choice of English Premiership club matches in the Champions Cup, with Sky receiving the same privilege for the Challenge Cup.\nPremiership Rugby and LNR were described as having employed \"bully-boy tactics\" by \"The Irish Times\".\nOrganisation.\nShortly after the establishment of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) to administer the new competition from a new base in Neuchatel, Switzerland, the running of the inaugural 2014–15 tournament was subcontracted to the organisation it had been meant to replace, Dublin-based European Rugby Cup (ERC). This was despite the latter having been described by chairman of Premiership Rugby, Quentin Smith, as \"no longer fit for purpose\". This was described as \"something of an about-turn\" by \"The Daily Telegraph\".\nEPCR were still looking to hire a permanent chairman and director-general more than a year after their establishment.\n2015 final.\nThe inaugural Champions Cup final was brought forward by three weeks due to a French desire not to interrupt their domestic playoffs. This was said to have \"devalued\" and \"diminished the status of the occasion as the pinnacle of European club rugby\".\nWhile the 2015 Heineken Cup final had been due to take place at the San Siro in Milan, the first European final to take place in Italy, the new organisers decided to move it to Twickenham Stadium in London in order to \"guarantee the best possible financial return to clubs\". However, with less than two weeks to go before the final took place, it was reported that fewer than half of the stadium's 82,000 seats had been sold, with just 8,000 French supporters travelling to London to watch Toulon face Clermont. The organisers subsequently made \"free\" tickets available on Ticketmaster (with only a £2 booking fee applicable), before admitting to this being a mistake – the offer supposed to have been linked to a purchase of a Premiership final ticket. This was described as an \"embarrassing fiasco\" by the \"Western Mail\" in Wales. 56,622 fans subsequently attended the game. EPCR were said to have \"failed on many levels\" by \"The Irish Times\", with the attendance figure for the final \"a fitting postscript to the hastily-convened decider to what was, after all the brinkmanship, a hastily-convened tournament\"."

        "title": "2014 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 5 October 2014 at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Mie. It was the 15th race of the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship, and the 30th Formula One Japanese Grand Prix. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the 44-lap race starting from second position. His teammate, Nico Rosberg, finished second and Red Bull Racing driver Sebastian Vettel was third. It was Hamilton's eighth victory of the season and the 30th of his Formula One career.\nGoing into the race, Hamilton led Rosberg by three points in the World Drivers' Championship and their team led the World Constructors' Championship by 174 points over Red Bull. Heavy rain from Typhoon Phanfone made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting from behind the safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg immediately blocked a pass by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced oversteer, and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead over the next four laps, before overtaking him on the 29th lap and pulling away.\nThe race was scheduled to run for 53 laps, but was brought to an end on the 46th lap (with the result taken at the end of lap 44) after an accident involving Jules Bianchi. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at the Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap and collided with a tractor crane that was tending to Adrian Sutil's Sauber, which had spun off on the previous lap. Bianchi sustained severe head injuries in the accident, from which he died in France on 17 July 2015, thus becoming the first driver to die as a result of injuries sustained in a Formula One race since Ayrton Senna in 1994. The accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel in which it was determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash. The investigation led to the virtual safety car (VSC) being introduced from the 2015 season onwards.\nThe victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, with Daniel Ricciardo a distant third. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the World Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari in the battle for third place with four races left in the season.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was the 15th of the 19 races of the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship, and the 30th running of the event as part of the Formula One World Championship. It was held on 5 October at the 18-turn Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Mie. The event's official name was the \"2014 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix\", and it was scheduled to last 53 laps over a distance of .\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought four types of tyre to the race: two dry compounds (the white-banded medium \"options\" and the orange-banded hard \"primes\") and two wet-weather compounds (intermediate and full wet). The drag reduction system (DRS) had one activation zone for the race, on the straight linking the final and first corners. The circuit underwent changes following the previous year's race; parts of the track between the 14th and 15th turns were resurfaced, TecPro barriers were installed on the inside after the exit of turn 15 and lamp posts near debris fences outside turns 13 and 14 were moved back.\nGoing into the race, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 241 points, three ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg, with Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo third with 181. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso was fourth with 133, followed by Ricciardo's teammate Sebastian Vettel with 124. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship with 479 points, having won eleven of the previous fourteen races of the season, while Red Bull were second with 305 points, having won the other three races; they were followed by Williams (187), Ferrari (178) and Force India (117). Mercedes had to outscore Red Bull by 41 points to clinch the Constructors' title in Japan.\nDespite reclaiming the Drivers' Championship lead at the preceding , Hamilton said that he was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, aimed for a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.\nTyphoon Phanfone, classified as a category-four storm, was forecast to make landfall over the eastern Japanese coast on race day with heavy rain and winds of up to . Although the storm was predicted to miss Suzuka, heavy rain from its northern edge was expected to drench the circuit. The , scheduled for the following week, made it impossible for the Japanese Grand Prix to be postponed until Monday due to freight schedules to Russia for the teams' equipment. Bernie Ecclestone, owner of Formula One's commercial rights, raised the possibility of moving up the start time, but later said that the event would proceed as planned. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) race director, Charlie Whiting, suggested to race organisers that the start time be moved and warned them that the race would not take place unless it was declared safe, but they refused. Honda, the owners of the track, reportedly rejected the start time change to allow spectators to arrive at Suzuka in time for the start. Whiting was also overruled by senior FIA officials, who opposed the disruption of the event's worldwide television coverage.\nThere were 11 teams (each representing a different constructor) entering two race drivers for the event and two free practice session participants. Red Bull selected Formula Three driver Max Verstappen to replace Jean-Éric Vergne to test him as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in the season. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend. Caterham confirmed that Roberto Merhi would replace Marcus Ericsson, and Kamui Kobayashi would drive in the race. Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Will Stevens was announced as participating in the first practice session in Max Chilton's car, but a problem with paperwork sent to the FIA Contract Recognition Board due to an industrial action in Germany prevented him from driving.\nPractice.\nThere were three practice sessions – two on Friday and a third on Saturday – preceding Sunday's race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations to see how the cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of 1 minute, 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Valtteri Bottas, Kimi Räikkönen, Kevin Magnussen, Ricciardo, Jenson Button, Vettel and Daniil Kvyat. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled over to the side of the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, while Merhi spun at turn 13, causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him.\nIn the second session, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at 1 minute, 35.078 seconds. Rosberg, Bottas, Button, Vettel, Räikkönen, Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo completed the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into a barrier at turn 18. Kobayashi lost control of the rear of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, while Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into a tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14; this resulted in a second red flag stopping the session early due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap of the third session at 1 minute, 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Felipe Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vergne, Kvyat and Button occupied positions four through ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto a run-off area and collided with a tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear at the exit of turn 15 but avoided a crash.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect during this part, requiring drivers to set a time within 107 per cent of the fastest lap in order to qualify. The second part lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final session lasted 12 minutes and determined pole position to tenth. Cars who progressed to the final session were not allowed to change tyres for the race's start, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times in the second session. Rosberg set the fastest time in the second and third sessions to clinch his eighth pole position of the season, the twelfth of his career with a lap of 1 minute, 32.506 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Hamilton, who missed out on pole position when, on his final lap, he hit the chicane curb before accelerating too fast into the final corner. Williams teammates Bottas and Massa qualified third and fourth, and Alonso and Ricciardo took fifth and sixth. Magnussen, whose mistakes on his quickest timed lap cost him time, took seventh. His McLaren teammate, Button, secured eighth and locked one of his tyres—flat-spotting it and slowing him. Vettel, struggling on corners due partially to Red Bull's use of wet tyres, took ninth. Räikkönen was tenth, encountering problems with his car's balance which prevented him from pushing.\nVergne was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session. Because his team had changed his engine, he received a ten-place grid penalty, his sixth of the season. This promoted Force India's Sergio Pérez to 11th position; he had encountered slower cars entering the final chicane, which forced him to slow and lose brake and tyre temperature. Kvyat's final timed lap was disrupted by slower cars; when he entered the first corner his tyres had not reached their optimum temperature, compromising his run and leaving him 12th. Nico Hülkenberg qualified 13th in the other Force India car after he locked his tyres at the final chicane. Adrian Sutil progressed to the second session after making balance set-up changes, and took 14th in its closing seconds; his Sauber teammate, Gutiérrez, struggled with tyre temperature and was delayed by traffic on his out-lap, leaving him 15th. Pastor Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, but Lotus installed a new engine (his sixth of the year) in his E22 chassis on Friday morning. Like Vergne, he incurred a ten-place grid penalty (carried over to the next race because he qualified within the top-ten bottom positions). His teammate, Romain Grosjean, took over 16th position and aimed to qualify higher; however, a change in wind direction prevented him from recording a faster lap time. Ericsson and Jules Bianchi started from 17th and 18th, with Kobayashi 19th and Vergne 20th. Chilton lost control of his Marussia's rear, causing him to start 21st.\nQualifying classification.\nThe fastest lap in each of the three sessions is denoted in bold.\nNotes:\nRace.\nThere was a large amount of standing water on the track at the start, since Typhoon Phanfone had brought heavy rain to the area. The air temperature was , and the track temperature was . About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car at 15:00 Japan Standard Time (), with no formation lap; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, spinning into a gravel trap; marshals pushed his car out of the gravel, allowing him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the pit lane, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their ride heights raised to make them less prone to aquaplaning on their underbody planks. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain eased. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue – possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions – to become the race's first retirement on lap 3. His departure promoted Ricciardo to fifth place, with Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.\nAlthough Hamilton became concerned about his Mercedes' brakes, he was told that it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 9, and cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Rosberg heading into the first corner, while Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, also without success; he then ran wide at the Spoon Curve but remained on the track. Pérez overtook Kvyat for ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.\nBottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit stops to change to intermediate tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the same lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops on lap 13, Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on lap 14 and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times in an attempt to move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off onto the run-off area at the Spoon Curve, reducing the gap by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, with Vettel moving to the inside line and passing Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on this lap; Ricciardo then attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, but Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.\nMagnussen made a second pit stop at the end of lap 16 to change his steering wheel. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on lap 18; Bottas then fell to sixth on lap 19 when Ricciardo passed him around the outside at the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the gap to third-place Button, with Ricciardo driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but Vettel was still 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg, who now led Hamilton by only one second having run off the track at 130R. A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.\nDRS was enabled on lap 24. Although Hamilton had closed Rosberg's lead to half a second and used DRS, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a pit stop this lap, which went wrong as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On lap 27, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear; his brakes locked, and he went onto the turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.\nGutiérrez lost ninth position on lap 30 when he was passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water on the inside of the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres on the same lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button, still third, recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth position on the same lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; his pit crew also changed his steering wheel, lengthening the stop and putting him behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton. Rosberg made his second pit stop, for new intermediate tyres, on lap 33 and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto a run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres, giving Ricciardo the lead. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36; Ricciardo made his pit stop during this lap and rejoined fifth, behind Hamilton, Rosberg, Vettel and Button. On lap 38, Magnussen ran wide onto the first-turn run-off area, while Vergne went off the track at the second corner and Vettel drove into a gravel trap at the S-turns; all three drivers continued running. Ricciardo closed up to Button on the same lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide.\nHamilton recorded the overall fastest lap of the race on lap 39, at one minute and 51.600 seconds. Weather conditions continued to deteriorate, resulting in DRS being disabled on lap 41; visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover, while drivers were dazzled by the lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to overtake Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. Ricciardo finally got past at the hairpin on lap 42, with Button then making a pit stop for full wet tyres. On the same lap, Sutil aquaplaned into the outside tyre barrier at the left-hand Dunlop Curve (turn seven) atop a hill. Double yellow flags were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap which turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Then, on lap 43, Bianchi, who had ignored the yellow flags, lost control of his Marussia at , veering right towards the run-off area on the outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.\nBianchi collided with the left-rear wheel of the tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact briefly jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 \"g0\" (2,490 m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database, which sources information from racing accidents worldwide, indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extricated from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather, so Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15 km (9.3 mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.\nA second red flag was waved on lap 46, bringing the race to an early end; the results were taken from the running order at the end of lap 44. Hamilton thus won from teammate Rosberg by 9.1 seconds, with Vettel twenty seconds further back in third. Ricciardo finished just under ten seconds behind his Red Bull teammate, and nearly half a minute ahead of Button. Massa, Bottas, Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kvyat, Räikkönen and Gutiérrez filled the next three positions, each one lap behind Hamilton, with Magnussen, Grosjean, Maldonado, Ericcson, Chilton and Kobayashi the last of the classified finishers who were not involved in any incident. Bianchi and Sutil were classified in 20th and 21st, despite their accidents. Hamilton and Rosberg both led on two occasions, with Rosberg leading 26 of the 44 laps and Hamilton the other 18. Hamilton's victory was his eighth of the season and the 30th of his Formula One career.\nAfter the race.\nOut of respect for the seriously injured Bianchi, the top three finishers did not spray champagne. At the podium interviews, conducted by the World Champion Nigel Mansell, Hamilton said that it had been a difficult race weekend and his speed near the end of the race was reminiscent of the 2008 British Grand Prix. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was lucky that the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw no difference in the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.\nBianchi's crash overshadowed the race. His father, Philippe, initially reported to \"L'Équipe\" that Bianchi was in critical condition with a head injury and was undergoing an operation to reduce severe cranial bleeding. The FIA then said that CT scans indicated that Bianchi sustained a \"severe head injury\" in the crash, and would be admitted to the intensive care unit after surgery. His family later reported that he had a diffuse axonal injury, a traumatic brain injury common in vehicle accidents involving quick deceleration. The first family update after Bianchi's emergency surgery was made by his father during the week of 13 October; the driver was reportedly in a \"desperate\" condition, with doctors saying that his survival would be a miracle. His father said that he drew hope from the emergence of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher from his coma. Marussia also issued regular updates on Bianchi's condition, denying initial speculation about their role in the accident. Former FIA president Max Mosley described it as a \"freak accident\".\nControversy arose after an amateur video clip of Bianchi's crash, showing a marshal waving a green flag at the crash site, was uploaded to social media. Four-time world champion Alain Prost said that the marshal should have moved away from the crash scene, but five-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Emanuele Pirro said that it was normal practice and anyone who said otherwise was \"mistaken\". According to several commentators, the marshal committed no infraction. Former driver and Sky Sports F1 announcer Martin Brundle called for recovery vehicles to be barred from driving on the track. Driver steward Mika Salo defended Whiting's decision not to deploy the safety car after Sutil's crash, and minimised claims that the race was stopped for intensifying rain. Rede Globo lead commentator Galvão Bueno, however, was vocal in his criticism of Whiting's decision, describing it as \"the biggest mistake I've seen in 40 years in Formula One\".\nThe FIA announced a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, to investigate the cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded that it would have been impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.\nHospitalised in Yokkaichi, Bianchi remained in a critical but stable condition on a medical ventilator. He was removed from his induced coma in November and began breathing unaided, enabling him to be transferred to the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) in Nice. Bianchi remained unconscious in critical condition there, but his family were better able to visit. On 13 July 2015, Bianchi's father said that he was \"less optimistic\" about his son's chances because of the lack of significant progress and the length of time since the accident. Bianchi died four days later, aged 25, thus becoming the first Formula One driver to be killed by injuries sustained during a Grand Prix since Ayrton Senna in 1994. Bianchi's funeral, on 21 July at Nice Cathedral, was attended by members of the Formula One community.\nThe race result increased Hamilton's lead over Rosberg in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points. Ricciardo and Vettel maintained third and fourth place, and Alonso remained in fifth despite his retirement. Mercedes moved further ahead of Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, with a 180-point lead over the Austrian team. Williams increased their advantage over Ferrari in the battle for third, and Force India retained fifth place with four races left in the season.\nRace classification.\nDrivers who scored championship points are denoted in bold.\nNotes:"

        "text": "Queanbeyan District Cricket Club ('The Bluebags') is a cricket club operating in the Queanbeyan district of New South Wales and playing in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) cricket competition. It was formally founded in 1863.\nHistory.\nCricket began to be played in an organised fashion in New South Wales in the 1830s. On January 2, 1863 a meeting of twenty five persons was held in Mr. W. Lee's long room to establish the 'Queanbeyan Cricket Club', \"to pay yearly in advance, in order to prevent the breaking down, such as other clubs had, by the trouble of collecting monthly subscriptions.\" Mr. Wright was elected to the office of president; Mr. WV. Scrivenor, treasurer; Mr. DeLissa, secretary; and Messrs. Morton, Kinseln, Davis and Doyle to be members of the committee. In the 1850s a more informally structured 'Queanbeyan Club' or 'Queanbeyan District Club' had played cricket against teams from Braidwood, Gininderra, Goulburn (the 4th such match being played in 1859) and Yass. Occasional games were also played in the 1850s between the married and single members of the Queanbeyan club. Queanbeyan's first police magistrate Captain AT Faunce died while playing cricket for the Queanbeyan club on 26 April 1856, having been instrumental in introducing cricket to the region (he and his brother having played for a Military team in Sydney in the 1830s including against the Australian Cricket Club at Hyde Park in 1833 and the Racecourse in 1834, as well as against an Australian civilian XI in 1834). His son, the Rev. Canon AD Faunce of the Goulburn Diocese and St Clement's Church at Yass also played for the Queanbeyan Club in the 1850s and 1860s.\nThe Queanbeyan District Cricket Club entered the ACT competition with the Federal Territory Cricket Association in the latter's inaugural season in 1922-23. Queanbeyan's home ground at this stage was Queanbeyan Park and it won the Premiership in the 1927-28 and 1928-29 seasons. It was on a canvas-covered concrete pitch on 11–18 December 1926 that Queanbeyan scored 527 (Clarrie and Sid Hincksman scoring 246 and 105 respectively). In the 1935-36 FCTCA final against a Northbourne team that fielded champion Lorne Lees, Tom O'Connor for a Queanbeyan side with only 10 men took 6/27 (off 17.4 overs) and 5/63 before coming to the wicket at 6/127 with 180 needed to win. O'Connor hit 46 (including 13 and 19 off his two overs from Lees, with six fours and a six) of the 53 needed to win the match. Other notable performances by the club included scoring 728 in 10 hours in a semi-final against Ginninderra in 1985-86 (M Frost 164, P Solway 119, J Bull 106, M Thornton 97, M Carruthers 112), its 651 against ANU in 1989-90 (P Solway 339) and the dramatic final win in 1990-91 over Weston Creek (R Regent 63 and P Solway 53 and 43 off 56 balls) with Neil Bulger conceding only 1 run off 11 overs in dismissing Weston Creek for 89 with seven balls left to play. In January 2012, Queanbeyan (with a team including brothers Blake and Jono Dean) won the final of the SCG Country cup against Merewether District Cricket club, Queanbeyan being the first ACT Cricket team to have reached the final (played at the SCG). In the 2011-12 two day Grand Final Blake Dean, batting at 7 with the score 87-5 hit 130 from 191 balls to set up 394 in the first innings. On Feb 2 2013 Jono Dean scored an unbeaten 300 runs in a single day for Queanbeyan against Ginninderra in a Douglas Cup Match; the innings including 17 sixes and 21 fours and was the second highest individual innings in ACT first-grade cricket history. On 2 November 2013 Jono Dean scored 234 and Blake Dean (cricketer) 69 in a total of 6-437 declared against Weston Creek Molonglo The Queanbeyan win by 6 runs against Tuggeranong on 2 Feb 2014 in ACT First grade John Gallop Cup grand final at Manuka oval was regarded as one of the best one day games ever played on the ground. In 2014, after his first year for the ACT Comets, Queanbeyan 1st grade all-rounder Vele Dukoski was named Cricket Australia Futures League 'Player of the Year' and later that week scored a hundred in Queanbeyan's semi-final win.\nCompetitions, Management and Home ground.\nThe club fields teams in Cricket ACT Men's Grade Competitions.

The team is under the American Tackle Football Federation of the Philippines (ATFFP), which was founded by Bernaro “Dodi” Palma II in 2009.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAmerican Football has been in the Philippines since as early as 2001, with the flag football variant being introduced first. A flag football league was established, with its teams defeating other teams from China and Singapore. Around 2010, tackle football was introduced with a league on the standard variant of football being established by then. An international club team called the Philippine Punishers was formed which defeated teams from China, Hong Kong, and Saipan.\nDebut as the Philippine Aguilas.\nIn 2014, the first official national tackle football team, which was called Philippine Aguilas, was organized. They made their first official international debut at the 2015 IFAF World Championship – Asian Qualifier Game against Japan on April 26, 2014. The Philippines was defeated by Japan on their first game with the score 0-86.\nThe Philippines hosted their first ever international friendly at home against the Western Australian Raiders of the Australian Gridiron League. The national team lost the match held at the Emperador Stadium by 7–56. In 2015, the team organized a friendly match against the Korea Tigers, a team bannered by the Korea University. The Aguilas lost to the Tigers, with the close scoreline of 33–38.\nAguila All-Star era.\nThe national team is funded by its players, not by the government. It occasionally receives funds from sponsors. In 2016, a non-profit Player's Association was formed by players, which are part of teams that were part of ArenaBall Philippines such as the Bandits, Knights, Renegades, Wolves, and the Vanguards, as well as from other leagues such as the Templars and the Neros which were newly formed by the time of the association's establishment. This association uses its funds for international games, a free league and for charity events. The core of the national team is composed of players from this association and has adopted the moniker \"All-Star Aguilas\". This team is also known as the \"Aguila All-Stars\"\nAll-Star Aguilas won their first match against an international opposition when they won over the Korean Tigers at their second meeting at the PHIL-KOR Cup in February 2016."

        "text": "The Wales national rugby union team toured South Africa in June 2008, playing two matches against the South Africa national team. South Africa won both tests, winning 43–17 in Bloemfontein on 7 June and 37–21 in Pretoria a week later.\nFixtures.\nThe venue for the first match was put in doubt due to ongoing work at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The schedule for the tour was confirmed on 27 March 2008; the first match would be played at the Free State Stadium on 7 June 2008 as scheduled, with the second at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria a week later. The winners of the series would win the Prince William Cup, a trophy first awarded at the teams' previous meeting in Cardiff in November 2007. The matches were not played using the Experimental Law Variations (ELVs) that had been trialled during the 2008 Super 14 season, which South Africa coach Peter de Villiers said gave Wales an advantage.\nSquads.\nWales.\nWales went into the tour as reigning Six Nations champions and unbeaten under new coach Warren Gatland, for whom this was his first tour in charge. After an intensive fitness camp in Ireland that included uncapped scrum-half Warren Fury, Gatland named an initial squad of 27 for the tour. Several members of Wales' Grand Slam-winning team were left out due to injury, including flankers Martyn Williams and Robin Sowden-Taylor (shoulder), full-back Lee Byrne, centre Gavin Henson (ankle), and scrum-halves Mike Phillips (knee) and Dwayne Peel (shoulder), while number 8 Alix Popham ruled himself out ahead of a summer move to French club Brive. Fellow back row Colin Charvis was left out after his club, the Newport Gwent Dragons, refused to release him for the training camp in Ireland. Meanwhile, wing Mark Jones recovered from groin surgery in time to be picked. Hooker Huw Bennett (ankle) and uncapped scrum-half Andy Williams (back) later also pulled out injured; Bennett was replaced by Ospreys scrum-half Richard Hibbard, while Williams was not replaced, leaving Fury as the only recognised back-up to Gareth Cooper, although wing Shane Williams said he would fill in at scrum-half if asked, having begun his career playing the position for Amman United. As well as Fury, lock Bradley Davies and centre Andrew Bishop were the other uncapped players included in the squad. Cardiff Blues hooker T. Rhys Thomas was called into the squad after Matthew Rees suffered a calf injury in the first test.\nSouth Africa.\nThe two matches against Wales were South Africa's first at home since being crowned world champions in the 2007 Rugby World Cup final against England. In January 2008, they appointed Peter de Villiers as their head coach, replacing Jake White, whose contract expired at the end of 2007. Selecting predominantly from the pool of players based in South Africa, as per a ruling by the South African Rugby Union board, De Villiers named a 30-man squad for the series against Wales and the match against Italy the following week; he picked four uncapped players, including Zimbabwe-born props Tendai Mtawarira and Brian Mujati, but there were several injury absentees from the side that won the World Cup, including centre Jaque Fourie, flanker Schalk Burger (knee) and scrum-half Fourie du Preez (hand). Wing Bryan Habana and lock Bakkies Botha were included in the squad after the resolution of a legal dispute between Botha and the South African Rugby Union over his planned move to French second division side Toulon."

The Mustangs are members of Ontario University Athletics, one of the four regional associations within the national governing body of U Sports. The Mustangs play at Thompson Arena in London, Ontario.\nThe men's hockey team has won 3 OUA championships (1994–95, 2004–05, 2008–09) and 1 U Sports championship (2001–02)\nTeam history.\nEarly history.\nIn 1905, the first hockey club was established at the University of Western Ontario. The sporting teams were organized by the two faculties at Western during this time, the Arts &amp; Divinity faculty and the Medical \"Meds\" faculty. The teams practiced on ice rinks around London, as well as on the Thames river. By the 1913-14 season, hockey became the most popular sport on campus and a combined faculty team went on to represent Western in the Canadian Hockey Association championships, playing Berlin (now Kitchener, Ontario) in the final match. Western lost 6-4.\nStart of intercollegiate hockey.\nWestern entered the intercollegiate competition in the 1923-24 season. This league comprised St. Michael’s College of Toronto, the Ontario Agricultural College and the University of Toronto. The team also played some exhibition games during 1920s, including a game against Princeton University in the 1926-27 season and one against the University of Michigan in the 1928-29 season.\nIn the 1932-33 season, Western won its first Canadian Intermediate Intercollegiate Championship by beating the University of Ottawa in the finals 6-1. Hockey at Western proceeded into the 1930s but was suspended in 1941-44 due to World War II. When the London Arena was not available for the 1936–37 season, J. Howard Crocker arranged to play home games in Brantford, and have practices an outdoor rink on campus. After the war, the team kept competing in the Intermediate Intercollegiate league, as well as the senior London City League. \nThe team continued until the mid 1950s. During this time, a lack of funding and ice time caused the team to be cancelled in 1955. The university did not have a rink at this time and there was little funding for intermediate teams.\nSenior intercollegiate hockey and the OUA.\nIn the 1964-65 season, Western joined the Ontario-Quebec Athletic Association. This was due to large support from Bill L’Heureux over the years prior. During this season, L'Heureux acted as the coach and the team placed third in a ten-team league, finishing 4th in the playoffs. While attending Western, Brian Conacher played with the Mustangs during their first season. Ron Watson took over as coach in 1965 and coached the Mustangs for 20 seasons, leading the team to the playoffs 18 years out of his 20 year reign.\n1980s - 2000s.\nAfter Ron Watson, Barry Martinelli took over in 1985. Mike Tomlak played for Western in the 1986-87 season. The team had medium success during this time, but it started to rise when Steve Rucchin joined the Mustangs from 1990 to 1994.

        "title": "List of esports games",
        "text": "Esports are video games which are played in professional competitions, usually fall into a few major genres. The majority of esports titles are fighting games, first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), traditional sports, and multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA), with the MOBA genre being the most popular in terms of participation and viewership. Players around the world will compete in trying to win the prize pool. The following is a selection of games which currently have or had a professional scene, sorted by genre and ordered roughly chronologically.\nFighting games.\nFighting games were among the earliest games to be in tournaments, with the founding of what would become the Evolution Championship Series in 1999.\nCompetitions in the genre are generally individual competitions with both players providing input to the same machine. The genre originally focused on arcade play, but has gradually moved to console play as arcades have declined. The \"Street Fighter\" series, \"Mortal Kombat\" series, \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series, \"Tekken\" series, \"Killer Instinct\" series and \"Super Smash Bros.\" series are amongst those fighting games played at a professional level. Important tournaments for the genre include the Evolution Championship Series and Capcom Cup, Tougeki – Super Battle Opera was a major tournament for several years.\nFighting game enthusiasts generally prefer the moniker \"competitive gaming\", and often eschew the term \"esports\", citing cultural differences between the predominantly PC-gaming esports communities and the older arcade-gaming community.\nMembers of the fighting game community are generally especially cognizant of their cc to the old arcade-era competitions, wishing to prioritize the preservation the spirit of those competitions over simple monetization of fighting competitions.\n\"Street Fighter\".\nThe \"Street Fighter\" has one of the earliest and longest running professional gaming scenes.\nProfessional \"Street Fighter\" players include Daigo Umehara, who had two of his matches included in a 2011 Kotaku list of \"The 10 Best Moments in Pro-Gaming History\". His early 1998 match against American player Alex Valle in \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\" ranked sixth and his 2004 comeback against American player Justin Wong in \"\" ranked first, while his 2009 grand finals match against Wong in \"Street Fighter IV\" at Evo 2009 was listed as having \"[j]ust missed the cut\".\n\"Super Smash Bros.\".\nNintendo's \"Super Smash Bros.\" series has a large competitive community. While every title has been featured in high-profile tournaments, \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" are the most popular for high level competition as of 2018. Major League Gaming regularly sponsored \"Melee\" events from 2004 to 2007, before dropping it in favor for the 2008 sequel \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". According to Major League Gaming, over 400 \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" competitive tournaments were held in 2010 in North America. Since then, \"Melee\" has again been periodically hosted at MLG events, with the latest being MLG 2015 World Finals. \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" had an online contest sponsored by ESL. Other notable national tournaments to feature \"Smash\" games include Apex and Evolution Championship Series (EVO). At EVO 2019, \"Smash Ultimate\" became the largest \"Smash\" tournament ever with 3,534 entrants.\n\"Marvel vs. Capcom\".\n\"Marvel vs. Capcom\" (MvC) is a fighting game series developed by Capcom that features characters from Capcom games and Marvel comic book characters. The series was played at the Evolution Championship Series from 2000 until 2017.\n\"Tekken\".\nNamco's \"Tekken\" series is known as the lightning chess of fighting games, having a large player base in Asian countries. Over the years Tekken has been cited as the most technical among fighting games. Praised for its balance, strong basics, depth and one of the few fighting games to feature a real 3D design, it continues to be featured in various championships. The \"Master cup\" series of Japan, \"Final round\" series of U.S.A, \"Strongstyle\" series of U.S.A, \"UT\" championship series of Europe are a few examples of events that are, or started off as exclusive Tekken events, and still hold it as a main game. The \"King of Iron Fist Tournament\" is a Tekken only tournament hosted by Namco themselves. Apart from this, other shows such as \"Tekken Crash\", \"Tekken Strike\" are Tekken only shows held in South Korea on the esports channel \"Nice Game T.V\". Tekken has made it periodically into the Evo Championship series, and since 2013 has become a permanent part of the event. Although it has a lesser player-base in the west, it seems to be steadily rising. In the east it dominates the arcade scene today leaving other games of its genre miles behind.\n\"Killer Instinct\".\nThe \"Killer Instinct\" series is a combo-heavy franchise created by Rare and currently maintained by Iron Galaxy Studios and Microsoft. The franchise' most-played game is the 2013 Killer Instinct reboot, with the platform of choice being Xbox One. A circuit for the game has been created called the Killer Instinct World Cup, with a second iteration ending in early 2017. Killer Instinct's best player is Jonathan \"Rico Suave\" Deleon, who currently holds the EVO and Killer Instinct World Cup titles.\nIn January 2017, Ultra Arcade enforced a ban on taunting and teabagging in major Killer Instinct tournaments which sparked controversy among the fighting game community with some stating that it is considered impossible to enforce due to certain players' playstyles.\nFirst-person shooters.\nFirst person shooters focus on simulating a firefight from a first person perspective, and may be either individual or team based. Classic games include the PC game \"Team Fortress 2\", which is featured in a few smaller leagues such as the ESEA League, RGL, United Gaming Clans, and European Team Fortress 2 League. \"Call of Duty\" and \"Halo\" competitions usually play their console editions.\n\"Doom\".\nDoom is a series of multiplayer 1v1 and free-for-all deathmatch games developed by id Software. Doom is notable for establishing the arena-style deathmatch format, and also was partially responsible for the first online FPS community through DWANGO, an online gaming service officially endorsed and partially worked on by id Software. People also played Doom deathmatch online through other BBS services. The Ultimate DOOM and Doom II, alongside Heretic, were played in the Deathmatch '95 tournament, sponsored by id Software, Microsoft, and DWANGO. This tournament, perhaps the first PC esports tournament of its kind, was played through the online DWANGO service. Finalists from the US and the UK were flown to Microsoft headquarters to compete in a LAN party format event, named Judgement Day. Dennis Fong, best known for his victory at the Red Annihilation tournament for \"Quake\", won Judgement Day, marking his first entry into esports. Doom II was also played in Cyberathlete Professional League and QuakeCon tournaments.\n\"Doom 3\" featured a 1v1 mode which was played professionally at QuakeCon 2004, QuakeCon 2005, and CPL Winter 2004, but was ultimately replaced by \"Quake 4\" and \"Painkiller\".\n\"Quake\".\nQuake is a series 1v1 PC based games developed by id Software. In 1996, id released the original Quake, and launched QuakeCon. QuakeCon is an annual convention which hosts competitions for the series, and has become the largest LAN event in North America. The first offline \"Quake\" tournament, Red Annihilation took place in May 1997. The winner, Dennis Fong, going under the alias \"Thresh\", took home the prize of \"Quake\" co-creator John D. Carmack's own red Ferrari 328 GTS convertible.\n\"Quake 4\" supported a small professional scene, with a dozen professional players signed to a few professional teams and a number of players marketing themselves through other means. Tournament play for \"Quake 4\" peaked around 2006, with the game included in tournaments such as the Electronic Sports World Cup, the World Series of Video Games before the league's demise, the World Cyber Games 2006, and KODE5. As of 2008, \"Quake 4\" has fallen out of favor in competition for the previous game in the series, \"Quake III Arena\".\n\"Quake Live\" was released in 2010, primarily based on \"Quake III Arena\". \"Quake Live\" was played in tournaments such as DreamHack, QuakeCon, and FaceIt. The popularity of the title declined after a couple years. In 2012, the last major tournament to host \"Quake\" competitions, the Intel Extreme Masters, decided to drop the title.\n\"Quake Champions\" was opened for Closed Beta Test on April 6, 2017, it was thereafter released as Early Access within Steam's early access program on August 22.\nBethesda announced the availability of a free-to-play trial at E3 2018 downloadable on Steam. Players who signed up during the free trial period got to keep playing for free after E3.\nDuring Quakecon 2018, it was announced that Quake Champions would be free-to-play and open to all players on August 10, 2018.\nCompetitions have been held at Dreamhack and on QuakeCon, at first in Duel, Sacrifice and also 2v2.\nIn 2019 there was announced that a Quake Professional League (QPL) would start at QuakeCon the same Year and then would be running with four stages with a stage final after each stage and a big final at QuakeCon 2020.\nQuakeCon 2020 was however cancelled as a LAN-Event due to the COVID-19-Pandemic and the final was held online with players from Europe, CIS, North America, South America and Australia competing.\nDuring 2020 and 2021 the QPL is running every week and broadcastsmon Twitch.\n\"Counter-Strike\" series.\nThe \"Counter-Strike\" series is a series of team based first person shooters which began as a \"Half-Life\" mod which was bought by Valve and released from beta in 2000. Professional competition is centered in North America and Europe in tournaments such as the World Cyber Games, CEVO, ESEA League, Intel Extreme Masters, Cyberathlete Professional League and the Electronic Sports League. The defunct league Championship Gaming Series franchised teams with contracted players who played \"\".\n\"Counter Strike\" is consistently at competitions such as DreamHack and World Cyber Games as the 1.6 version released in 2003, despite newer versions having been released by Valve over the years.\n\"Call of Duty series\".\nThe \"Call of Duty\" series is a first-person shooter that has been played as an esport primarily in North America and is primarily played on PlayStation consoles, but was formerly played on Xbox. It has been featured in MLG tournaments ever since \"\" was introduced to the league in 2008. Tournaments usually have a large number of unknown teams competing to play with the top pro teams. A well known example is OpTic Gaming, and FaZe who have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from competing in leagues and tournaments.\n\"Unreal Tournament\".\nBeginning with the release of the first game in 1998, the \"Unreal Tournament\" series of first person shooters supported competitions in the early 2000s, such as the series' inclusion the World Cyber Games from 2001 through 2004. There are no longer major tournaments for the series, as it has been dropped from leagues such as the Electronic Sports League.\n\"Halo series\".\nThe \"Halo\" series has been featured in the American Major League Gaming since the release of Halo: Combat Evolved for the original Xbox. The series has also been played internationally, such as the European Console League's event in July 2010 in Liverpool. The Australian Cyber League hosted a Pro Circuit with tournaments in several major cities in Australia, including a January 2009 event in Brisbane. Partially due to changes to the series' design, \"Halo\" competitions have gone into steep decline that started in 2010 with the release of Halo: Reach, a drastic change from what was considered traditional Halo, as seen in the original three games. The decline had continued into late 2013–2014 where Halo 4 had been introduced and was an even bigger change to the series than Halo: Reach, and as a result had no major competitive events held, other than the Halo 4 World Championships, which was put on by developer 343 Industries as an early attempt to save Halo esports. 343 Industries later released Halo: The Master Chief Collection, re-releasing all 4 original titles in 60fps, but featuring a completely remastered version of Halo 2 to use as the primary game for halo esports. Although this was a good attempt by the developer to bring back the dying community, the game suffered from many bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable, which furthermore damaged that Halo esports community. At the same time around the release of Halo: the Master Chief Collection, 343 Industries introduced the Halo Championship Series as another attempt to re-establish Halo as a competitive esports title. As Halo declined, it was dropped from Major League Gaming, to be replaced by Call of Duty as the new staple game for the league. Currently Halo 5 is the newest game in the series and has entirely built around being competitive and well suited for esports, featuring vanilla competitive settings, a wide array of competitive game modes, and an in-depth spectator mode. 343 Industries is hosting the Halo World Championships, which will be a 4v4 competition, held in part with competitive leagues MLG, ESL, and Gfinity. The prize pool is currently 2 million dollars, which is crowd funded through Halo 5's in-game \"REQ Pack\" purchases. The game franchise's history in esports is currently focused at the Halo Championship Series (HCS) Pro League in conjunction with the ESL esports organization, with the first season finished up in mid-2016.\n\"Painkiller\".\n\"Painkiller\" is a 2004 game developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly and published by DreamCatcher Interactive. At the end of 2004 \"Painkiller\" was chosen by the Cyberathlete Professional League to be their official 2005 CPL World Tour game. This was slightly controversial with many esports followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online multiplayer games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one deathmatch format competition, \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" and \"Doom 3\" were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" developer Epic Games was in the process of changing publishers from Atari to Midway Games and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year-long tour, it was not chosen. An agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher stipulated that no other organization was allowed to use \"Painkiller\" in a gaming competition with prizes above 2,000. without obtaining a license from the CPL. For the 2006 CPL World Tour, \"Quake III Arena\" was selected as the one-versus-one deathmatch game, replacing \"Painkiller\".\n\"Battlefield series\".\n\"Battlefield\" series games have been played in multiple tournaments.

From The International 2013 onward, its prize pool began to be crowdfunded through a type of in-game battle pass called the \"Compendium\", which raises money from players buying them and connected lootboxes to get exclusive in-game cosmetics and other bonuses offered through them. 25% of all the revenue made from Compendiums go directly to the prize pool, with sales from the 2013 battle pass raising over 2.8 million, which made it the largest prize pool in esports history at the time.

However, its expansion pack \" was far more popular than the original.\n\" was foundational in the establishment of esports, and along with \"StarCraft II\", remains among the most popular series in competitive gaming. \"StarCraft\" competitions did especially well in South Korea, which remains central to the competitive scene as a whole. Professionals in Korea achieved a status similar to professional athletes. In the west, \"StarCraft\" enjoyed significantly less competitive popularity. \"StarCraft\" was the very first game to have been accepted into the World Cyber Games tournament, and had a tournament at their events every year until it was replaced by \"StarCraft II\" in 2011.

Events have been organized by Blizzard Entertainment, have also been televised Korean leagues, and large tournaments have been held in China. Chinese players generally have used their own clients for online competition, due to a poor connection to the outside world. Notable \"Warcraft III\" players include: Xiaofeng \"Sky\" Li, Dae Hui \"FoV\" Cho, Jang \"Moon\" Jae Ho, Fredrik \"MaDFroG\" Johansson and Manuel \"Grubby\" Schenkhuizen.

He was the Big South Conference Player of the Year in 1999 as a collegian at the University of North Carolina at Asheville and played professionally in Finland.\nMartin, a 6'5\" forward from Westerville, Ohio, teamed with Shaun Stonerook to lead Westerville North High School to the 1994 Ohio Division I state championship. From there, Martin committed to walk-on at nearby Ohio State University. As a walk-on, Martin played a bigger role than expected, averaging 16.1 minutes and 7.6 points per game and even started four games for the Buckeyes in the 1994–95 season. In the offseason, Martin chose to transfer to a school where he could expect more playing time, ultimately settling on UNC Asheville.\nAt Asheville, Martin enjoyed a standout career under coach Eddie Biedenbach. The Bulldogs won the Big South Conference regular season title in both 1997–98 and 1998–99, and Martin was named to the 1999 all-conference team after averaging 13.4 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. As a senior, Martin broke out, averaging 21.9 points per game to lead the conference in scoring. He repeated on the all-conference team and was honored as Big South Player of the Year. In his career, Martin scored 1,340 points in three seasons.\nAfter going undrafted in the 1999 NBA draft, Martin played the 1999–2000 season with Äänekosken Huima in Finland. For the season he averaged 17.5 points and 6.3 rebounds per game.\nHe is currently the head boys basketball coach at Westerville Central High School in Westerville, Ohio and the former coach of Johnstown-Monroe High School in Johnstown, Ohio."

        "text": "Stockholm 2022 was a bid by Stockholm with Åre and the Swedish Olympic Committee for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The bid was announced at November 11, 2013. The IOC will select the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics at the 127th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 31, 2015. Stockholm previously hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and hosted equestrian events at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\nOn 17 January 2014, the Moderate Party in Stockholm decided not to support the bid, and after that there is a clear majority in the city council against organising the games.\nOn 17 January 2014, Stockholm dropped a bid for 2022 Winter Olympics.\nHistory.\nIn summer 2013, the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOK) has expressed plans to submit an application for the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2022 Winter Paralympics in the capital Stockholm. Four alpine skiing events will be held in Åre in northern Sweden. SOK has the support of the Swedish Sports Organization for the Disabled and Swedish Paralympic Committee and the Swedish Sports Confederation. Some people has expressed that the distance between Stockholm and Åre is too far, about . Åre has three times before applied for the games together with nearby city of Östersund, but have been turned down all times. Östersund was also interested in a potential 2022 bid, but the Swedish Olympic Committee decided not to move forward with bidding due to a lack of financial guarantees from the government. Östersund is probably also too small to host the Olympic Games. Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth, Minister for Culture and Sports, has said that she finds it difficult to see a future Olympic games in Sweden. The president of the Swedish Olympic Committee Stefan Lindeberg thinks that Stockholm's size is perfect for the Winter Olympics and says the city already has the most of what is needed. According to calculations, a Swedish Olympic Games will costs approximately 15–20 billion SEK (€ 1.7–2.3 billion).\nOn October 1, 2013, investigator Jöran Hägglund indicated that it is entirely possible to host the Winter Olympics in Stockholm. Hägglund estimated the implementation budget to 9.79 billion SEK (€ 1.13 billion) and the investment budget to 2.5 billion SEK (€ 290 million). The games will be concentrated entirely in the Stockholm area, and only eight of the alpine events are planned to be held in Åre. He also said that five investments are necessary; a new track to bobsleigh, luge and skeleton, improve the vertical drop fairly much in , a new ski jump, speed skating venue and a cross country venue. The infrastructure and other ice venues already exists in Stockholm. The reason for this cost cut is that the Swedish government does not want to support the games with big money (several 100 million euros). However the IOC requires the government to guarantee support for cost overruns etc. A more thorough investigation showed that the cost estimation was uncertain. IOC requirements would demand reconstruction of several existing arenas, adding VIP lounges for IOC members and separate ones for media, restaurant kitchens etc.\nPrevious bids.\nStockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics. Stockholm also hosted the Equestrian events in the 1956 Summer Olympics.\nStockholm bid to host the 2004 Summer Olympics but lost to Athens.\nPrevious bids by other Swedish cities.\nGothenburg (with cities spread over Sweden) bid to host the 1984 Winter Olympics but lost to Sarajevo. Falun (with Åre) bid to host the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics but lost to Calgary and Albertville respectively.\nÖstersund bid to host the 1994, 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics but lost to Lillehammer, Nagano and Salt Lake City respectively.\nFuture bids.\nStockholm co-bidded for the 2026 with Åre, but lost out to Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\nVenues.\nList of proposed venues:\nTransportation.\nStockholm is served by the Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, which has intercontinental flights. The distance between Stockholm and Åre is about . There will be air connections to Åre Östersund Airport around 90 km from Åre. There are suggestions to use an airfield at Järpen ( from Åre), which probably must be upgraded to be used for commercial passenger flights. Groups in large planes going to Åre will probably use the Trondheim Airport in Norway ( from Åre). There are train connections between Stockholm and Åre, needing around 6 hours."

The scoring average for the round was 69.6, the lowest in PGA Championship history.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 10, 2014\"\nFinishing the round in almost complete darkness, Rory McIlroy made par on the 18th to win his fourth career and second consecutive major championship. Beginning the round with a one-shot advantage, McIlroy fell from the lead with two bogeys on his first six holes. Rickie Fowler recorded birdies on four out of five holes on the front-nine, Phil Mickelson made four birdies on his first nine while Henrik Stenson made five birdies on the front to each pass McIlroy. Down by as much as three shots, McIlroy jumped back into contention with an eagle at the 10th to get within one shot. Fowler and Stenson both made bogey on the 14th, while Mickelson bogeyed the 16th. McIlroy, meanwhile, birdied the 13th and 17th to get to 16-under-par. Needing eagle on 18 to tie McIlroy, Mickelson's chip from off the green narrowly missed while Fowler missed on a lengthy putt. McIlroy found a greenside bunker at the last then two-putted for par and a one-shot win over Mickelson. With this win McIlroy became the first player since Tiger Woods in 2008 to win three straight starts on the PGA Tour (he previously won the Open Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational), and the first since Pádraig Harrington to win consecutive majors. Harrington won the same two in 2008, the Open Championship and PGA Championship. \nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "Title Bout Championship Boxing",
        "text": "Title Bout Championship Boxing, abbreviated as TBCB, is a text-based boxing simulation that offers historical and fictional play, as well as the ability to forecast upcoming bouts. It is based on the popular 1979 tabletop game of the same name, which was created by Jim and Tom Trunzo.\nHistory.\n\"There really wasn't a decent representation of our favourite sport, pro boxing,\" Jim Trunzo recalls of the decision he and his brother made in the late 1970s to create a game in which players flipped cards to simulate a fight, rather than use the dice or spinners that were prevalent in sports simulations of that era.\nThe Trunzos self-published the game, with help from Jim Barnes, who had founded the Statis-Pro line of sports simulation games. Barnes had developed what he called a \"Fast Action Deck\" to simulate the action and had given the Trunzo brothers his blessing to use the same concept in their game.\nAfter the self-published version of \"Title Bout Championship Boxing\" barely made its money back, the Trunzos secured a deal with Avalon Hil, which had purchased Statis-Pro and wanted to compete with APBA and Strat-o-matic in the sports simulation space. Avalon Hill had also arranged a marketing partnership with Sports Illustrated to boost its credibility.\n\"Title Bout: The Game of Professional Boxing\" sold well but was eventually discontinued as gamers moved away from tabletop sports games to computer ones. The Trunzo brothers did not retain the name of their game, but they had the rights to the rest of it and released TKO Boxing for DOS through Lance Haffner Games in 1990. They later published another tabletop game, APBA Boxing, that used dice, and in 2001 Comp-U-Sport brought the game back to the digital realm with Title Fight 2001.\nThe Trunzos eventually sold the game to OOTP Developments, publishers of Out of the Park Baseball and Franchise Hockey Manager. OOTP released \"Title Bout Championship Boxing 2\" in 2005 and version 2.5 in 2008. In 2013, OOTP sold the game to P.I.S.D. Ltd, which released \"Title Bout Championship Boxing 2013\" in June of that year. Based on comments in the Title Bout community, the initial PISD version was a failed product and fans of the game are still waiting for an update some eight years later.\nGameplay.\n\"Title Bout Championship Boxing\" displays a boxing ring with fighters who trade blows, an immersive blow-by-blow text, a crowd that cheers, and ring card girls who flash up between rounds. The game features over 6,660 boxers past and present and in every weight class, allowing players to not only recreate historical fights but also stage bouts that could never have happened, such as Muhammad Ali taking on Mike Tyson in the prime of their careers, Floyd Mayweather battling the legendary Joe Gans, or Sam Langford trading punches with Marvin Hagler. The game's database is updated on a regular basis, allowing players to also forecast upcoming fights. Acting as promoter you stage fights between all the leading contenders, no exceptions.\nBouts can be simulated once or multiple times, allowing the player to discard outlier events and see how a fight will likely unfold. Players can also set up tournaments and peruse statistics that are tracked fight-by-fight as well as round-by-round, allowing them to see, for example, how many knock-outs have happened in a specific round. Win–loss records can be imported or they can start from 0–0 so all boxers in the game build unique histories.\n\"Title Bout Championship Boxing\" also has many customisation options, including the ability to import boxer images and add new fighters to the game."

        "text": "The 2008–09 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2008–2009 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by John Thompson III and played their home games at the Verizon Center in Washington, DC. The Hoyas were members of the original Big East Conference. They finished the season 16-15, 7-11 in Big East play. They lost to St. John's in the first round of the 2009 Big East men's basketball tournament. They received an at–large bid to the 2009 National Invitation Tournament, earning a 6 seed in one of the NITs regions, and lost to Baylor in the first round.\nSeason recap.\nRegular season.\nComing off a 2007-08 season which saw a second consecutive Big East Conference regular-season championship, a second straight appearance in the Big East tournament final, a third straight NCAA tournament appearance, and a postseason No. 12 national ranking for Georgetown, the Hoyas were expected to have another impressive season even though only one scholarship senior, Jessie Sapp, returned for 2008-09. Although four-year starter and point guard Jonathan Wallace had graduated in 2008, sophomore guard Chris Wright, recovered from a broken foot that caused him to miss much of the 2007-08 campaign, was expected to fill in ably as his successor, and the Hoyas placed great confidence in freshman center Greg Monroe as the next \"big man\" who could replace center Roy Hibbert, who also had graduated in 2008. Although guard Jeremiah Rivers had transferred to Indiana during the offseason, sophomore guard Austin Freeman returned after a very promising freshman year. At forward, Patrick Ewing Jr., had departed through graduation, but junior DaJuan Summers returned and, although forward Vernon Macklin had transferred to Florida after the previous season in search of greater playing time, sophomore forward Julian Vaughn joined the Hoyas after playing for a season at Florida State. Freshman center Henry Sims also joined the team to come off the bench behind Monroe. The Hoyas entered the season with a No. 22 ranking in the preseason Associated Press Poll.\nNon-conference schedule.\nThe season began well enough with Georgetown displaying a strong defense in wins over Jacksonville and Drexel and Monroe showing his expected defensive prowess and making the first Georgetown score, rebound, and blocked shot of the year. He scored 14 points, grabbed seven rebounds, and blocked three shots against Jacksonville and contributed 20 points, eight rebounds, four assists, three steals, and three blocked shots against Drexel, a game in which he shot 7-for-9 (77.8 percent) from the field. Chris Wright had 16 points, five rebounds, and four assists against Jacksonville and 11 points, seven assists, and five rebounds in the Drexel game, while Summers and Sapp each scored 13 points against Jacksonville. Summers finished with 10 against Drexel.\nMoving up to No. 21 in the AP Poll, the Hoyas next traveled to Lake Buena Vista, Florida, to play in the Old Spice Classic. They met Wichita State in the first round in a game in which the Shockers outrebounded the Hoyas 17-6 but shot only 27.9 percent from the field, and Georgetown went 8-for-8 in free throws in the final minute to preserve a 58-50 victory, with Austin Freeman scoring a game-high 18 points, DaJuan Summers 14, and Greg Monroe 11. In the semifinal the following day, the Hoyas faced No. 12 Tennessee, their first ranked opponent of the season. Four Hoyas – Chris Wright with 18 points, DaJuan Summers with 17, Greg Monroe with 15, and Austin Freeman with 12 – scored in double figures as Georgetown shot 53 percent from the field. But Georgetown also committed 20 turnovers, including 10 in the first 15 minutes, and had an uncharacteristically porous defense, allowing the Volunteers also to shoot 53 percent from the field, and Tennessee had a 39-37 advantage at halftime. Early in the second half, the Hoyas went on a 23-10 run to pull ahead, 65-57, but the Volunteers then responded with a 10-1 run of their own to take a 67-66 lead, followed by an 8-3 run to give Tennessee a 75-69 advantage. With some starters in early foul trouble on both sides, both teams′ benches saw significant playing time, and that worked to Tennessee's advantage, with the Volunteers′ bench outscoring the Hoyas′ bench 37-12. Tennessee handed the Hoyas their first defeat, 90-78. Georgetown thus met Maryland two days later in the third-place game, only the third meeting between the cross-town rivals since 1980, the first since the 2001 NCAA tournament, and the first during the regular season since 1993. Freeman scored 18 points, Summers contributed 14, Monroe had 12, and Jessie Sapp scored 10 as the Hoyas made 10 of their first 14 shots, shot 53.1 percent from the field, and held the Terrapins to 36.1 percent shooting. Georgetown led by as many as 21 points in the first half, by 38-20 at halftime, by 61-33 with 13 minutes left in the second half, and by 73-38 with 7½ minutes to play on the way to an easy 75-48 victory to secure third place.\nWith a record of 4-1 and ranked No. 20, the Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center for a five-game homestand. In the first two, they easily defeated American and Savannah State, the latter coached by former Georgetown player Horace Broadnax. Chris Wright scored a career-high 22 points and DaJuan Summers and Jessie Sapp had 14 points each against American in a game in which American scored only 12 points in the first half, the lowest score by a Georgetown opponent in the first half since John Thompson III took over as the Hoyas′ head coach in 2004. In the Savannah State game two days later, Georgetown, by then ranked No. 19, scored 100 points for the second time in John Thompson III's tenure and had a 62-point margin of victory that was its biggest since a 112-39 defeat of the University of the District of Columbia on December 16, 1989. Freeman, Sapp, and Summers had 14 points each, Monroe had 13, and freshman guard Jason Clark came off the bench to score 10 against Savannah State.\nIn the third game of the homestand, Georgetown faced No. 17 Memphis. Summers led the team with 21 points, Austin Freeman scored 18, Chris Wright added 14 points and played an excellent defensive game against Tigers point guard Tyreke Evans, and Greg Monroe had 13 points and six rebounds. It was a tight game, with Memphis leading 38-37 at the half, and for six of the last 6½ minutes of the second half neither team led by more than one point, Freeman finally putting the Hoyas ahead 66-64 with a free throw with 31 seconds left in regulation. The Tigers scored to tie the game at 66-66 and force overtime, but thereafter shot 1-for-9 from the field while the Hoyas outscored Memphis 13-4 during overtime for a 79-70 upset victory. Although Memphis outrebounded Georgetown 53-36, the Tigers shot only 35 percent from the field. The win stretched Georgetown's home winning streak to 26 games, which the Hoyas then extended to 28 straight as the homestand concluded with victories over Mount St. Mary's – the first meeting of the schools since January 1962, with Chris Wright scoring a game-high 19 points, DaJuan Summers adding 13, and Jessie Sapp grabbing a career-high nine rebounds – and Florida International. In the Florida International game, the first game between the schools since December 1989, the Hoyas held the Golden Panthers to a total of 38 points, the lowest scoring total in Florida International's history. On the Georgetown side, Austin Freeman scored 17 points, Chris Wright had 14, and DaJuan Summers added 13, while Greg Monroe had 10 points, six rebounds, and five steals.\nConference schedule.\nRanked No. 11, with a record of 9-1 and the winners of six straight games, the Hoyas closed out 2008 by opening their Big East Conference schedule with a visit to No. 2 Connecticut, which had won seven straight games against ranked opponents. Georgetown began the game with an 18-3 run against the veteran Huskies, and led 36-27 at halftime. Thirteen seconds into the second half, Greg Monroe hit a three-pointer to stretch the lead to 39-27, but Connecticut then went on a 13-1 run to close to a 40-37 deficit. With Georgetown clinging to a 42-39 lead with 13:19 left to play, Austin Freeman sparked Georgetown's offense, scoring seven of the first nine points of a 14-6 Georgetown run that gave the Hoyas a 56-45 advantage with 9:46 remaining. Connecticut never got closer than nine points the rest of the way, and Georgetown led by as many as 17 points in pulling off a 74-63 upset victory. In the second half, the Hoyas made 18 straight free throws and finished 18-for-21 (85.7 percent) from the free-throw line. DaJuan Summers had 18 points, Chris Wright and Greg Monroe scored 16 points each, and Freeman added 13. It was Georgetown's eighth straight win in a Big East season opener, five of them under John Thompson III. The Hoyas′ winning streak grew to seven, and their record improved to 10-1.\nAt the time Georgetown upset Connecticut, the Big East boasted seven ranked teams, and the relatively young and inexperienced Hoyas faced a challenging conference schedule as a result. Connecticut was the first of three ranked teams the Hoyas faced to open their conference schedule, leading John Thompson III to note in a postgame interview, \"The commissioner isn't handing out trophies tonight and it doesn't get easier.\" With that in mind, the Hoyas began 2009 by hosting No. 3 Pittsburgh in their next game. Although DaJuan Summers scored 22 points and Greg Monroe added 15, the undefeated Panthers used their depth to dominate Georgetown, outrebounding the Hoyas 46-21 and outscoring them from the paint 48-22, while Pittsburgh's bench outscored Georgetown's 14-2. Leading 33-30 at halftime, the Panthers shot 53 percent from the field in the second half and pulled out to a 55-44 lead with 7:47 left in the game. Pittsburgh sophomore forward DeJuan Blair had a double-double (20 points and 17 rebounds), and Pittsburgh won 70-54. The loss ended Georgetown's 29-game home winning streak.\nThe following day, the Hoyas left for South Bend, Indiana, for a January 5 game at No. 13 Notre Dame – winners of 43 straight home games – by which time Georgetown had climbed to No. 9 in the AP Poll. Greg Monroe led the Hoyas with a double-double (21 points and 10 rebounds) and Chris Wright scored 13, while DaJuan Summers contributed 11, his second-lowest scoring performance of the season. Notre Dame junior forward Luke Harangody, meanwhile, led the Fighting Irish, scoring the last 13 Notre Dame points of the first half to give Notre Dame a 39-28 lead at halftime and, despite sitting with four fouls with 15:17 left to play and Notre Dame leading by six, reentered the game less than four minutes later and scored 10 points and grabbed five rebounds before time expired. Georgetown battled back to a 71-67 deficit with 13 seconds left, but the Fighting Irish upset the Hoyas 73-67 to extend their home winning streak to 44 and hand Georgetown consecutive losses for the first time since January 2007. Harangody finished with a double-double (31 points and 11 rebounds).\nGeorgetown returned to the Verizon Center for a two-game homestand that began with a come-from-behind win over Providence in which Greg Monroe had a double-double (13 points and 10 rebounds) along with eight assists and five steals, Austin Freeman scored 18 points, Chris Wright had 16, and Jason Clark contributed 10. The Hoyas dropped to No. 13 in the AP Poll by the time they met another ranked opponent, No. 8 Syracuse, winners of seven straight, in their next game. The underdog Hoyas rose to the occasion with their best three-point-shooting performance of the season, scoring on 12 out of 21 shots (57.1 percent) from three-point range. Opening with a 10-2 lead, Georgetown scored 14 straight points halfway through the first half as part of a 21-4 run that saw the Hoyas make 11 straight shots over nine minutes and stake themselves to a 37-18 lead with 4:25 left. With a four-point play, Austin Freeman gave the Hoyas a 47-26 lead with two minutes left, and Georgetown went into the locker room at halftime with a 50-32 advantage. The Orange rallied to begin the second half with eight unanswered points, and closed to a 53-45 deficit with 15:43 left to play, but DaJuan Summers hit a three-pointer 11 seconds later to stretch the lead to 56-45. Georgetown led by double digits for the rest of the game on the way to an 88-74 upset victory, dealing Syracuse its first conference loss of the season. DaJuan Summers had a game-high 21 points, while Austin Freeman shot 4-for-5 in three-pointers and scored 19 and Greg Monroe had 10 points and six rebounds. The 88 points were the most a Georgetown team had scored against a Big East opponent since John Thompson III's arrival in 2004, and the Hoya bench played a major role, scoring 29 points, including a career-high 12 points by Jason Clark.\nThree days later, Georgetown played its last nonconference game of the season, taking on yet another ranked opponent, no less than No. 2 Duke, in a visit to Durham, North Carolina. Duke entered the game having won seven straight games and riding a 67-game winning streak on its home court against non-Atlantic Coast Conference opponents. The game was tied 29-29 with 4:39 remaining in the first half, but Duke reeled off 11 straight points while holding Georgetown scoreless and led 40-29 at halftime; the Hoyas went into the locker room without having scored a field goal in the last 7½ minutes of the half. The Blue Devils pulled ahead to a 15-point lead early in the second half, but Georgetown responded with a 13-2 run and closed to 46-42 with 15:33 left to play. But when Henry Sims was called for a blocking foul with 15:08 left, Greg Monroe objected so strongly from the bench that he was called for a technical foul, his fourth foul of the game. The momentum shifted back in Duke's favor, and the Blue Devils went on a 15-3 run to take a 61-45 lead with 10:43 left in the game. The Hoyas battled back to a 72-67 deficit with 38 seconds remaining, but Duke hit four free throws in the game's last 30 seconds to clinch a 76-67 victory. In a losing cause, DaJuan Summers led the Hoyas with 21 points and seven rebounds, while Austin Freeman scored 15 and Monroe contributed 12 points and six rebounds.\nGeorgetown emerged from the Duke game with a respectable 12-4 record against a tough schedule, including 3-2 in the Big East and 3-4 against ranked opponents, and even climbed to No. 12 in the AP Poll. But then the Hoyas′ season took a marked downturn, as the Duke setback was only the beginning of what turned out to be a five-game losing streak. Returning to conference play in their next game, against West Virginia, the Hoyas suffered a surprisingly one-sided loss in which the Mountaineers outshot, outrebounded, and out-defended Georgetown, especially in the second half: The Hoyas shot only 39.2 percent from the field overall – 2-for-16 (12.5 percent) from three-point range – and only 33 percent after halftime. The Hoyas′ shooting woes continued as they were upset again three days later at Seton Hall, which broke a six-game losing streak and won its first conference game of the season despite failing to make a single three-point shot for the first time since December 1991; Georgetown meanwhile shot a season-low 32.7 percent against the Pirates overall and went 3-for-22 (13.6 percent) in three-pointers, meaning the Hoyas had gone a combined 5-for-38 (13.2 percent) in three-pointers against West Virginia and Seton Hall. A fourth loss in a row ensued at Cincinnati in a game in which Georgetown shot 40 percent from the field but only 5-for-17 (29.4 percent) from three-point range while allowing the Bearcats to shoot 45.8 percent from the field. DaJuan Summers had 12 points each against West Virginia and Seton Hall, but sat out the second half of the game against the Bearcats with seven points after twisting his ankle, although he remained Georgetown's leading scorer for the season with 16.1 points per game through the end of the Cincinnati game. Chris Wright scored 13 points against West Virginia, 11 against Seton Hall, and 15 against Cincinnati. Greg Monroe contributed 11 points against West Virginia and 17 against Seton Hall, and 10 points and eight rebounds against Cincinnati, while Austin Freeman had 14 points and six rebounds against Cincinnati.\nThe fifth consecutive loss came on January 31 in a visit to No. 8 Marquette, a team undefeated in its seven conference games entering the Georgetown game. DaJuan Summers returned to action despite injuring his ankle in the Cincinnati game and tied his season high with 22 points, also pulling down seven rebounds, and Georgetown led by as many as seven points early in the first half. Marquette closed the gap, and the game was tied at 42-42 at halftime and 52-52 with 14:31 left to play. But then the Golden Eagles, led by senior guard Jerel McNeal, who scored 26 points, junior forward Lazar Hayward, who had 23, and senior guard/forward Wesley Matthews, who scored 19 of his 23 points in the second half, went on a decisive 12-2 run and took a 10-point lead with 11:03 remaining. Trailing by as many as 16 points after that, the Hoyas managed to close to an eight-point deficit with 1:03 remaining. However, Marquette went 6-for-8 from the free-throw line in the final minute – part of a 30-for-38 (78.9 percent) free-throw effort for the Golden Eagles during the game, compared to 8-for-13 (61.5 percent) for the Hoyas – to close out a 94-82 victory and drop Georgetown to 12-8 for the season and 3-6 in the conference, despite 19 points from Chris Wright, 13 from Greg Monroe, and 12 from Austin Freeman to go along with Summers′ performance. Plunging from No. 12 to No. 25 in the AP Poll after the loss to Seton Hall, Georgetown dropped out of the Top 25 entirely after losing to Marquette, not to return until the following season.\nAfter enduring their longest losing streak since 2005, the Hoyas staggered back to the Verizon Center to beat Rutgers in a game in which Jessie Sapp came out of his month-and-a-half-long slump to score 11 points, while Greg Monroe contributed 10 and Georgetown preserved a home winning streak against the Scarlet Knights that dated back to January 2000. But an overtime home loss to Cincinnati ensued despite 13 points, six rebounds, and five steals by Greg Monroe and 10 points from Austin Freeman. Georgetown traveled to the Carrier Dome a week later for a rematch with No. 22 Syracuse, which had lost five of its last seven games. The Orange led 33-32 at halftime but scored the first nine points after the intermission and pulled ahead to 66-50 with 8:11 left in the second half before the Hoyas rallied to tie the game at 83-83 at the end of regulation. In overtime, the Hoyas pulled ahead 89-88 with 2:13 remaining, but Syracuse then scored a three-pointer and two free throws to take a 93-89 lead and ultimately prevailed, 98-94. Before fouling out in overtime, Chris Wright scored 25 points, while Austin Freeman had 19 points, DaJuan Summers added 17, and Greg Monroe had a double-double (16 points and 11 rebounds). Sophomore guard/forward Nikita Mescheriakov started at guard in this game – and for the rest of the season – in place of the slumping Jessie Sapp, who was relegated to the bench.\nLosers of seven of their last eight games, the Hoyas had an easy win at South Florida, with Chris Wright scoring 17 points, Jessie Sapp adding 10, and Greg Monroe getting another double-double (12 points and 10 rebounds), before three straight games against ranked opponents. The first two – a rematch with No. 11 Marquette and a meeting with No. 6 Louisville – were at the Verizon Center. Against Marquette, on a day when Georgetown celebrated the 25th anniversary of its 1984 national championship, the Hoyas shot 51 percent from the field, with Chris Wright scoring 17 points, Austin Freeman 16, and Greg Monroe 13, while DaJuan Summers, the team's leading scorer for the season, scored 12 before fouling out with 2:47 left in the game. With both teams shooting 60 percent from the field during the game's first 12 minutes, Marquette pulled out to a six-point lead and later to a seven-point lead, but each time the Hoyas closed the gap, and Georgetown twice led by three points in the half's final three minutes before the teams went into the locker room at halftime with the game tied 44-44. In the second half, however, the Golden Eagles committed only one turnover, allowed Georgetown only one three-pointer, and gave up only two offensive rebounds, and Marquette took the lead for good with 7:58 to play on the way to a 78-72 victory. Two days later against Louisville, Georgetown forced the veteran Cardinals to commit 16 turnovers, but Louisville opened by shooting 9-for-9 from the field – not missing for the first 10:59 of the game, by which time the Cardinals led 26-13 – and hit its first seven three-pointers, not missing one until the second half. After their 9-for-9 start, the Cardinals shot only 15-for-35 (42.9 percent) the rest of the game, but they nonetheless led 41-24 with three minutes to play in the first half and 41-31 at halftime, and in the second half they forced Georgetown to commit 14 turnovers and held the Hoyas to only 31 percent shooting from the field to preserve a 76-58 victory. Although Chris Wright scored 12 points and Greg Monroe 10 during the game, the Hoyas never got closer than eight points during the second half.\nSix weeks earlier, Georgetown had been ranked No. 9 in the country, but the Louisville loss gave them their ninth defeat in 11 games and dropped them to 12th place in the 16-team Big East. Their demanding schedule continued with a visit to No. 12 Villanova on February 28. Both teams had strong defensive efforts, but Georgetown's defense was the better of the two: The Hoyas held the Wildcats to season lows in points (54), field goals (15), and shooting percentage from the field (33.3), as well as to 3-for-16 (18.8 percent) three-point shooting, and forced Villanova to commit a season-high 20 turnovers. For its part, Villanova forced Georgetown into a season-high 25 turnovers. The game stayed close until Georgetown finally pulled ahead over a 6:52 stretch late in the first half and early in the second during which the Hoyas made nine straight field goals and took a 40-32 lead with 17:21 left to play. Villanova closed to a two-point deficit three times, the last time at 52-50 with 5:02 remaining. Then both teams slumped on offense, with Villanova failing to score a field goal on eight straight possessions and committing three turnovers and Georgetown missing five straight shots from the field and committing two turnovers. The Wildcats closed to 52-51 on a free throw by sophomore guard Corey Stokes with 1:15 left to play, but Chris Wright scored on a layup and two free throws to give Georgetown a decisive 56-51 lead with 10 seconds remaining. DaJuan Summers scored 16 points, Wright had 13, and sophomore guard/forward Nikita Mescheriakov, starting in place of Jessie Sapp, contributed a career-high 11 points as Georgetown upset Villanova 56-54, the Hoyas' fifth straight win over the Wildcats.\nGeorgetown finished its regular season with an overtime loss at St. John's – the first overtime game in the 91 meetings between the schools – in which the Hoyas blew a 45-30 lead, breaking a five-game Hoya winning streak against the Red Storm, and a low-scoring win at the Verizon Center against DePaul that dealt the Blue Demons their 18th straight defeat and gave them a winless Big East season. Greg Monroe had 18 points against St. John's, while DaJuan Summers scored 10 points against St. John's and 15 in the DePaul game. Austin Freeman sat out the St. John's game with a hip injury, but started the DePaul game and scored two points.\nThe Hoyas finished the regular season with a record of 16-13 overall and 7-11 in the Big East, tied with Seton Hall for 11th place. It was their first losing record in the conference since the 2003-04 season.\nBig East tournament.\nSeeded 12th in the 2009 Big East tournament, Georgetown needed to win the tournament championship in order to make the 2009 NCAA tournament. In the first round, the Hoyas faced the No. 13 seed, St. John's, which had not won a Big East tournament game since 2003 and had only qualified for the tournament once in the previous five years. St. John's led 30-28 at halftime and extended its lead to 46-37 in the second half before the Hoyas went on a 12-0 run to take the lead, 49-46, with 6:05 left to play. The Red Storm took back the lead for good at 53-52 with 3:42 remaining, shooting 6-for-7 from the free-throw line the rest of the way – part of a 24-for-29 (82.8 percent) St. John's free-throw-shooting effort – to secure a 64-59 win and advance to the next round. Chris Wright scored 14 points and Greg Monroe 13, but the Hoyas exited the tournament in the first round for the first time since 2004.\nNational Invitation tournament.\nWith a 16-14 record, Georgetown missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 2004-05 season and accepted an invitation to the 2009 National Invitation Tournament, its first NIT appearance since 2005. Seeded sixth in one of the NIT's four regions, the Hoyas faced the region's No. 3 seed, Baylor, in the first round on Baylor's home court. The Hoyas shot 16-for-21 (76.2 percent) from the field in the first half to take a 44-34 lead at halftime, but the Bears opened the second half with a 13-2 run that gave them a 47-46 lead with 16:24 left to play. Georgetown retook the lead and stretched it to as many as five points, but Baylor junior guard Tweety Carter hit a three-pointer with 4:29 to play that gave the Bears the lead for good at 70-67. The Bears were clinging to a 72-69 lead with 11 seconds left when Chris Wright missed a three-pointer and Baylor sophomore guard LaceDarius Dunn grabbed the rebound, took a foul, and made two free throws to give Baylor a 74-69 advantage. DaJuan Summers sank a three-pointer with four seconds remaining to close to 74-72, and, after Carter missed the front half of a one-and-one, attempted his final shot as a Hoya, a long-distance heave that missed. Baylor won a postseason game for the first time since 1950, and Georgetown's disappointing season ended with a 16-15 record and the Hoyas exiting the NIT in the first round for the first time since 1999.\nWrap-up.\nFor the season, DaJuan Summers led the Hoyas in scoring, shooting 47.4 percent from the field and finishing with 13.6 points per game, while Greg Monroe finished the year with the team's highest field goal percentage (57.2 percent) and averaged 12.7 points per game. Chris Wright and Austin Freeman both shot 48.2 percent, with Wright averaging 12.5 points per game and Freeman 11.4 points. Jessie Sapp slumped during the season, shooting only 34.7 percent from the field and averaging only 6.5 points per game. Freeman missed one game, while the rest of them appeared in all 31 games during the season. Monroe was selected as the Big East Rookie of the Year.\nSapp graduated in 2009, completing a 135-game collegiate career in which he had started 92 times, averaging 7.1 points per game on 41.6 percent shooting from the field. Reserve forward Bryon Jansen also graduated. Summers announced in March that he would leave the team, choosing to forego his senior year of college to enter the 2009 National Basketball Association draft; the Detroit Pistons selected him as the 35th pick overall. Sophomore reserve guard/forward Omar Wattad announced in April that he would not return to Georgetown for his junior year, and decided at the beginning of May to transfer to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Wattad became the eighth Hoya in four seasons to leave Georgetown before his college eligibility expired, the others being Summers, Jeff Green, who also entered the NBA draft after his junior year, and Vernon Macklin, Jeremiah Rivers, Octavius Spann, Marc Egerson, and Josh Thornton, all of whom transferred.\nThe 2008-2009 Hoyas were a relatively young and inexperienced team with only one scholarship senior that played in a conference that boasted as many as seven ranked teams, and they had 12 games against ranked opponents during the season, winning only four of them. Georgetown fell precipitously from the Top Ten early in January to a 16-15 record by the end of the season, with losses in 12 of their final 16 games and first-round exits from both the Big East tournament and the NIT. After the Hoyas defeated DePaul in the last game of the regular season and reporters asked Blue Demons head coach Jerry Wainwright about his thoughts on why the 2008-2009 Georgetown team had fallen so far so fast, he replied that the Hoyas \"started with a bang and, I think, youth caught up with them.\"\nRoster.\nSource\n2008–09 Schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big East tournament \n!colspan=12 style=|National Invitation Tournament "

Each national team consisted of four members, with each skiing 7.5 kilometres and shooting twice, once prone and once standing.\nAt each shooting station, a competitor has eight shots to hit five targets; however, only five bullets are loaded in a magazine at one - if additional shots are required, the spare bullets must be loaded one at a time. If after the eight shots are taken, there are still targets not yet hit, the competitor must ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nSummary.\nThe Soviet Union had lost just one major championship in the last nine years, but it was also the most recent one, as they were beaten to the 1975 world championship by the Finns. The chances of this repeating were all but eliminated after the first leg, however; while Aleksandr Elizarov went through in the fastest time, more than 30 seconds clear, Henrik Flöjt missed a shot and finished the leg 7th, well over two minutes behind. Esko Saira made up some ground on the Soviets, and pulled Finland into second, but Kruglov and Tikhonov put together the two of the three fastest legs of the competition to close out a gold medal win.\nThe Finns were in a battle with the West Germans after two legs, but Josef Keck took three penalties, and left Finland with a big gap, which they easily took to a silver medal. East Germany had been floundering in 7th after three legs, as Frank Ullrich struggled with her shooting, taking four penalties. However, Manfred Geyer shot clear and had the second fastest leg overall, pulling them up past four teams to get the bronze medal."

Ikola took two minutes in penalties as well, meaning Kruglov, who had just one minute penalty, was able to pass him to win the gold medal. Aleksandr Elizarov could have taken silver with a better shooting performance than Ikola, but matched the Finn with two minutes in penalties, and while he cut Ikola's lead in half on the final section, he was left in third place.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and , only 44 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. In Test cricket, Willis took 325 wickets, including 16 five-wicket hauls. The \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" named him one of their cricketers of the year in 1978, and termed him \"one of the world's foremost fast bowlers.\"\nWillis made his Test debut during the fourth Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series, against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His first Test five-wicket haul came in the third Test of the 1974–75 Ashes series at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Willis' career-best figures for an innings were 8 wickets for 43 runs—seventh among Top 100 Bowling performances of all time by \"Wisden\"—at Headingley, during the 1981 Ashes series. He never took ten wickets in a match; his best performance for a match was 9 wickets for 92 runs against New Zealand in 1983 at Headingley. He was most successful against Australia, taking seven five-wicket hauls.\nWillis made his One Day International (ODI) debut against the West Indies at Headingley, during the 1973 Prudential Trophy. He never took a five-wicket haul in ODIs; his career-best figures for an innings were 4 wickets for 11 runs against Canada during the 1979 Cricket World Cup, a match England won by 8 wickets at Old Trafford. , Willis is thirty-ninth overall among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

Alexander Tikhonov had to take two penalty loops, and ended up more than a minute behind the surprise leaders from Japan, as Isao Ono stormed to a big lead. The British were also well placed, in third, with the East Germans splitting the two surprise contenders. In the second leg, the surprise teams fell off, the Japanese taking five penalty loops and the British four. It was the Soviets who asserted their authority, Rinnat Safin putting together the only sub 27-minute leg of the race to stake them to a one-minute lead. The Americans were now surprisingly in bronze medal position, while Norway's Kåre Hovda took three penalties to leave them more than two minutes behind.\nIvan Biakov needed a penalty loop on the third leg, but still managed to extend the lead over Dieter Speer of East Germany, with Sweden coming up into third place through some good shooting by Torsten Wadman. Viktor Mamatov had a quick final leg to ease the Soviets home to victory, while the other medal placing changed after some shooting struggles. Holmfrid Olsson of Sweden and Horst Koschka of East Germany each missed twice, dropping the Swedes out of the medals and the East Germans to bronze, behind a Finnish team that had a great final leg from Mauri Röppänen. As for Norway, all four of their shooters needed at least one penalty leg, but they still managed to finish fourth, though there was a substantial gap between them and the top three."

Finland's Esko Saira skied even quicker than Tikhonov, but had five minutes in penalties, and ended up 6th.\nSolberg remains the only champion to defend his title.\nResults.\nPenalties refer to minutes added, as described above, not (necessarily) number of targets missed."

The IOC selected the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 31, 2015, which Beijing won.\nHistory.\nThe Chinese Olympic Committee nominated Beijing as the candidate city for the 2022 Winter Olympics on November 3, 2013. In addition, Zhangjiakou is the joint city for the bidding. Zhangjiakou is located northwest of Beijing.\nPrevious bids.\nBeijing bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, but lost out to Sydney. Beijing went on to successfully bid for and host the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nPrevious bids from other Chinese cities.\nHarbin bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate city. Vancouver was ultimately awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics. Harbin also bid to host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics but failed to become a candidate. Innsbruck ultimately won the right to host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics.\nNanjing successfully bid to host the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics.\nVenues.\nThe Beijing Olympic Games Bidding Committee unveiled the gymnasium layout plan for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games on 20 February 2014: five ice events will be held at the Olympic center, the Capital Indoor Stadium and the Beijing Wukesong Sports Center. Competitions for luge, bobsleigh and alpine skiing will be held in Xiaohaituo Mountain area northwest of Beijing, 90 kilometers away from downtown. All other skiing events will be held in Taizicheng Area in Chongli District, Zhangjiakou, 220 kilometers away from downtown of Beijing and 130 kilometers away from Xiaohaituo Mountain Area.\nPollution issue.\nThe issue of air pollution, which was widely discussed during the 2008 Summer Olympics, was cited as a likely factor in Beijing's bid. Beijing and Zhangjiakou suffer from severe air pollution which is worse during the winter. As of February 26, 2014, Beijing hit a dangerous particulate concentration of 537. A rate of 301-500 is marked as hazardous. An anti-pollution body expressed a concern that Beijing companies failing to meet regulations were moving their factories to Tianjin and Hebei.\nLack of snow issue.\nThe lack of snow is cited by the IOC as an issue in Beijing's bid. The average snow depth in Yangqing, where the ski competitions would be held, is five centimeters. \nHuman rights issue.\nA study at the University of Chicago analyzed the progress of the IOC's Agenda 2020 to demand that host countries have equitable labor laws. It concluded that the acceptance of Beijing's bid undermined this initiative."

        "text": "Lviv 2022 (; ; ; ) was a bid by the city of Lviv and the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Lviv withdrew its bid on 30 June 2014. The IOC ultimately selected Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 31 July 2015.\nHistory.\nOn 27 May 2010, President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych stated during a visit to Lviv that Ukraine \"will start working on the official nomination of our country as the holder of the Winter Olympic Games in Carpathians\". Ukraine's only previous experience in hosting Olympic events was during the 1980 Summer Olympics hosted by Moscow, when, as part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine held several football matches in Kyiv.\nIn September 2012, government of Ukraine approved a document about the technical-economic substantiation of the national project \"Olympic Hope 2022\". This was announced by Vladyslav Kaskiv, the head of Ukraine´s Derzhinvestproekt (State investment project). The organizers announced on their website venue plans featuring Lviv as the host city and location for the \"ice sport\" venues, Volovets (around from Lviv) as venue for the Alpine skiing competitions and Tysovets (around from Lviv) as venue for all other \"snow sport\" competitions. By March 2013 no other preparations than the feasibility study had been approved.\nOn 24 October 2013, session of the Lviv City Council adopted a resolution \"About submission to the International Olympic Committee for nomination of city to participate in the procedure for determining the host city of Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2022\".\nOn 5 November 2013, it was confirmed that Lviv was bidding to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Lviv would host the ice sport events, while the skiing events would be held in the Carpathian mountains. This was the first bid Ukraine had ever submitted for an Olympic Games.\nOn 30 June 2014, the International Olympic Committee announced \"Lviv will turn its attention to an Olympic bid for 2026, and not continue with its application for 2022. The decision comes as a result of the present political and economic circumstances in Ukraine.\"\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Vilkul said that the Winter Games \"will be an impetus not just for promotion of sports and tourism in Ukraine, but a very important component in the economic development of Ukraine, the attraction of the investments, the creation of new jobs, opening Ukraine to the world, returning Ukrainians working abroad to their motherland.\"\nLviv was one of the host cities of UEFA Euro 2012.\nVenues.\nThe German companies Proprojekt and AS&amp;P conducted a feasibility study for a Lviv bid in May 2012, which proposed to hold all events in two clusters. The Lviv Ice Zone will host all ice sports, including bobsleigh and luge, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. The Tysovets Snow Zone and the Borzhava Alpine Area, both located in the Carpathian Mountains, would host the snow events.\nCity zone.\nThe main Olympic Park would be centered around the Arena Lviv, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies. The Olympic Park would have two ice rinks (ice hockey, short track speed skating and figure skating), a temporary speed skating oval and a temporary curling rink. The Olympic Park would also host the Olympic Village and International Broadcast Centre. A second ice rink for hockey competitions would be located just to the north-west of the Olympic Park. A sliding track would also be built in the east of Lviv.\nMountain zone.\nVenue cluster Tysovets-Panasivka.\nAn existing military ski training facility in Tysovets, 139 km south of Lviv, along with two disused ski jumps, are proposed to be rebuilt to host all Nordic events. Additionally, a ski hill would be developed to host all of the snowboard and freestyle skiing events.\nVenue cluster Borzhava.\nA new alpine skiing centre, with a vertical drop of 900m, would be developed at Borzhava. It would include an alpine athlete's village and media accommodation."

She reached the final for the first time since 2009, but lost to world No. 1 Serena Williams in straight sets.\nHer next tournament was the Australian Open, where she was the two-time defending champion. She failed to defend her title, losing in the quarter-finals to Agnieszka Radwańska in three sets.\nMiddle East series.\nAzarenka was due to play in the Qatar Total Open, where she was the two-time defending champion, but she withdrew before the tournament started due to a left foot injury.\nAmerican hard court season.\nAzarenka returned from her foot injury at the Indian Wells Masters, but she lost her first match to Lauren Davis, marking her earliest ever exit from Indian Wells. A recurrence of her foot injury at Indian Wells later forced her withdrawal from Miami for the second consecutive year.\nAzarenka withdrew from the Monterrey Open for the second consecutive year.\nClay court season.\nAzarenka was scheduled to play at both the Madrid Open and the Italian Open, however she withdrew from both tournaments after failing to recover from a left foot injury. Her absences from both events resulted in her dropping out of the top four for the first time since May 2011. She ultimately withdrew from the French Open after failing to recover in time for the event.\nGrass court season.\nAfter three months out due to a foot injury, Azarenka returned to the Tour at the Eastbourne International as a wildcard entry. She drew world No. 44 Camila Giorgi in the first round, and was defeated in three sets.\nAzarenka then played at Wimbledon, where she lost in the second round for the second year running; after defeating Mirjana Lučić-Baroni in the first round for her first win since January, she lost to Bojana Jovanovski in the second in three sets.\nUS Open series.\nAzarenka started her US Open series campaign as a wildcard entry at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford. After receiving a second round bye, she was defeated in the second round by Venus Williams in straight sets; as a result of that loss, she dropped out of the top ten for the first time since September 2010. She had marked her 200th consecutive week in the top ten in the week of Stanford.\nAzarenka's spell outside the top ten lasted just one week; by reaching the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup, where she lost to Agnieszka Radwańska for the second time this season, she re-entered the top ten in the week starting 11 August 2014 at the expense of Ana Ivanovic.\nShe later withdrew from the Cincinnati Masters due to a right knee injury she suffered at the Rogers Cup. This defeat has, again, seen her drop out of the top ten as she was the defending champion.\nAt the US Open, Azarenka reached the quarter-finals for the third consecutive year, but was upset by Ekaterina Makarova in straight sets. The loss saw Azarenka drop out of the top 20 for the first time in over six years.\nAsian hard court season.\nAfter the US Open, Azarenka commenced her Asian swing at the downgraded Premier tournament in Tokyo, where she was unseeded. She defeated Kimiko Date-Krumm in the first round in three sets, before losing to fellow former world number one and eventual champion Ana Ivanovic in the second in straight sets. She was then scheduled to play at the inaugural 2014 Wuhan Open and the China Open, however she announced that she will miss the remainder of the season due to knee and foot injuries.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nVictoria Azarenka's 2014 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly Records.\nHead-to-head match-ups.\nBold indicates that the player was in the Top 10, \"italics\" denotes that the player was in the Top 20 (at the time of the match being played).

        "title": "Chipping (climbing)",
        "text": "Chipping is a rock climbing technique that uses a hammer and chisel to manufacture new or increased hand-holds on the natural rock to make a climbing route more feasible. It is a controversial technique due to both environmental issues, and a sense that it goes against the very challenge of free climbing. The practice was more common in the past, it is considered less acceptable in modern climbing.\nHistory.\nThe process of chipping has been around since the first ascents of famous routes such as \"Outer Limits\" in 1971 and \"The Nose\" of El Capitan in Yosemite in 1958 when chipping was acceptable. Route manufacturing continued on through the clean climbing revolution of the 1970s where climbers moved away from outdated climbing technology, such as pitons, that damage rock to removable protection, such as nuts that do not damage the rock. Pitons are pins that are hammered into the rock, whereas nuts are small pieces of metal that fit into cracks and are removable. Manufacturing persisted on into the 1990s, especially in crags (an area that contains rock walls for climbing) in France. There are many instances of routes that are partially or even completely manufactured that were first put up in the mid 1990s in Europe. An example of this is \"L'autre Côté du Ciel\" by Fred Rouhling, or \"La Rose eh le Vampire\" by Antoine Le Menestrel (both in France). As indoor rock climbing gyms spread across the world in the mid 1990s, chipping seemed to subside as climbers could now create interesting routes with no need to modify rock.\nEthical controversy.\nOnce the mid 1990s had passed, the manufacturing of routes also began to subside as many climbers decided that it was a mistake to change the natural features of routes. In many crags, especially around the United States, chipping is not only frowned upon by the community but also illegal. This fact though does not stop practice in many areas.\nProponents.\nEven though it is generally accepted that chipping is a bad practice, some climbing areas allow it. Some climbers in areas such as Riggins, Idaho have accepted the use of chipping for the creation of new routes. Those who support chipping in these select few climbing areas accept this practice because the area's rock face is blank and climbs would be physically impossible without manufactured holds. The general consensus in these areas seems to be that the common belief against chipping is less important than having areas to climb.\nOpposition.\nAccording to climbing community polls, the large majority of climbers have a negative view on chipping. In fact, some are so vehemently opposed that they state they would take violent action against an individual who was chipping. One of the main arguments against chipping is that as climbers try to push their limits and find harder routes to climb, chipped routes lower the difficulty and possibly ruin a route that could have been an interesting climb to a better climber. To some, like climbing guide book author Stewart Green, chipped routes reflect \"egotism, selfishness, and mediocrity.\" According to Dave Graham there is a limited amount of climbable rock in the world and that by manufacturing a route it is impossible to ever put the rock back to its natural state.\nEnvironmental issues.\nAs more climbers join the sport every year, the environmental impact of climbing increases. Without clean climbing practices, techniques such as chipping have been shown to possibly compromise areas where rock climbing takes place. In an effort to partake in this endeavor, the National Park Service educates those looking to climb on its properties about the negative impact that practices like chipping have on natural resources. Climbers are usually informed about these issues during the process of picking up national park permits.\nIn the media.\nIn February 2013, an anonymous video of world class climber Ivan Greene was released. This video showed him chipping a climb on a boulder in the famous Gunks climbing crag in New York. Due to the release of this video, Ivan Greene was dropped by his sponsor Edelrid who publicly announced that they would be cutting all ties to him."

        "text": "Between the 1954–55 and 1970–71 seasons, 13 first-class cricket teams from East Pakistan played in the Pakistan domestic cricket competitions, the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and the Ayub Trophy. With the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, this participation ended. An East Pakistan Governor's XI also played a first-class match against the touring International XI in 1961–62.\nList of teams.\n\"NB:\" Team names are as they appear on CricketArchive scorecards. Some names differ in \"Wisden\", such as \"East Pakistan C.A.\" and \"East Pakistan Sports Federation\", both of which Cricket Archive calls simply East Pakistan.\nThe only one of these teams to defeat sides from West Pakistan was East Pakistan, which defeated Hyderabad four times, Khairpur once, and a combined Hyderabad-Khairpur-Quetta team once.\nEast Pakistan also played first-class matches against the touring Indians in 1954–55 and the MCC in 1955–56. The touring team won on each occasion.\nLeading players.\nThe only East Pakistan player to be selected in the Pakistan Test team was Niaz Ahmed. Several Test players from West Pakistan played for East Pakistan teams, however; when East Pakistan defeated Hyderabad-Khairpur-Quetta in 1966–67, the losing team protested that six of the East Pakistan team were actually from West Pakistan and should have been ineligible.\nAbdul Latif, who captained East Pakistan teams in several matches, was a prominent player in the 1960s. He scored three centuries, and took 24 wickets for 97 with his leg-spin in two consecutive matches for East Pakistan Greens in January 1968. Shamim Kabir, who played 15 first-class matches for various East Pakistan teams, later captained Bangladesh in their first match, against the touring MCC in January 1977. Javed Masood hit the highest score for an East Pakistan team when he scored 215 in the victory over Hyderabad in 1962–63.\nAccording to Shaharyar Khan, Niaz Ahmed was used for political purposes, to disguise Pakistan's neglect of cricket in East Pakistan: \"There was a club-level cricketer from Dhaka called Niaz Ahmed who was Pakistan's perennial 12th man for quite some time, the Pakistan Cricket Board attempting to give the entirely unconvincing impression that East Pakistan was on the verge of national representation. The fact was that no effort was made by the governments of Pakistan or by the cricket boards to promote cricket in East Pakistan.\"\nGrounds.\nMost first-class matches in East Pakistan were played at Dacca Stadium. Pakistan also played seven Tests at the stadium between 1955 and 1969."

        "text": "How Brown Saw the Baseball Game is an American short silent comedy film produced in 1907 and distributed by the Lubin Manufacturing Company. The film follows a baseball fan named Mr. Brown who overdrinks before a baseball game and becomes so intoxicated that the game appears to him in reverse motion. During production, trick photography was used to achieve this effect.\nThe film was released in November 1907. It received a positive review in a 1908 issue of \"The Courier-Journal\" that reported the film was successful and \"truly funny\". , it is unclear whether the print of the film has survived. The identities of the film cast and production crew are unknown.\nFilm historians have noted similarities between the plot of \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\" and \"How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game.\" It is a comedy film directed by Edwin S. Porter, having released a year before \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\".\nPlot.\nBefore heading out to a baseball game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home by one of his friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.\nProduction.\n\"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\" was produced by the Lubin Manufacturing Company, a company founded by German-American film pioneer Siegmund Lubin. At the time \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\" was made, the company was creating and distributing up to three films a week. The identities of \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\"s director and cast are not known.\nIt is a silent film shot in black and white, and the finished product comprised of film. For the scenes which took place at the ballpark, the filmmakers used a form of trick photography to show the baseball players running backwards. Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film on October 26, 1907, under the title \"How Jones Saw the Baseball Game\".\nRelease and reception.\n\"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\" was released to theaters by Lubin Manufacturing Company on November 16, 1907, and was still being shown as late as January 1910. During this time, the film was sometimes presented as part of a double feature with the 1907 film \"Neighbors Who Borrow\", a short comedy film about a man who lends nearly everything he owns to his neighbors until his wife returns home and berates him for doing so.\nAdvertisements for the film touted it as \"such fun\", and Lubin himself promoted the film as a \"screamingly funny farce\". It received a positive review in a June 1908 issue of \"The Courier-Journal\" which described the film as \"truly funny\" and that it proved to be \"a veritable hit\".\nModern writings have often suggested that \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\" was produced as Lubin Manufacturing Company's alternative to the Edwin S. Porter-directed comedy \"How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game\", a film released by Edison Studios in 1906 about an office employee sneaking out of his workplace to watch a baseball game only to discover his employer in a nearby seat. Lubin Manufacturing Company was known for creating films similar to competing motion pictures made by other studios. Lubin had previously created films resembling Edison Studios' releases \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and \"The Great Train Robbery\". Author Jack Spears wrote in his book \"Hollywood: The Golden Era\" that \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\" and \"How the Office Boy Saw the Ball Game\" \"used practically the same plot\"; Rob Elderman's article \"The Baseball Film: to 1920\" in the journal \"Base Ball\" likewise notes the similarities of their plotlines.\n, it is unclear whether there is a surviving print of \"How Brown Saw the Baseball Game\"; it has likely become a lost film. If rediscovered, the film would be in the public domain."

He was named first team All-ACC at the conclusion of the season.\nSenior season.\nGoing into his senior season in 2013–14, Harris received significant preseason recognition. He was a member of the preseason All-ACC team and was named to the preseason watch list for the Wooden Award as national player of the year. Harris led the Cavaliers to their first outright ACC regular season title since 1981, their first ACC tournament title since 1976, and their first Sweet Sixteen appearance since 1995. Harris subsequently earned ACC tournament MVP honors, and was named to the All-Tournament team and All-ACC third team.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2014–2016).\nOn June 26, 2014, Harris was selected with the 3rd pick of the second round (33rd overall) by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2014 NBA draft.

On November 14, during a 120–96 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, Harris suffered a left ankle injury. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on November 29 and was ruled out for at least 4-to-8 weeks. On March 3, 2022, Harris planned to undergo second ankle surgery and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2021–22 season.

        "title": "Historical horse racing",
        "text": "Historical horse racing (HHR), originally known as Instant Racing, is an electronic gambling product that allows players to bet on replays of horse races or dog races that have already been run, using terminals that typically resemble slot machines.\nThe primary providers of historical racing machines are Exacta Systems (a subsidiary of Churchill Downs, Inc.), PariMax (a division of the Stronach Group), and Ainsworth Gaming Technology.\nGameplay.\nIn the earliest incarnations of Instant Racing machines, gameplay begins when a player deposits his wager, and a race is randomly selected from a video library of over 60,000 previous races. Identifying information such as the location and date of the race, and the names of the horses and jockeys, is not shown. The player is able to view \"Skill Graph\" charts from the Daily Racing Form, showing information such as the jockeys' and trainers' winning percentages. Based on this handicapping information, the player picks the projected order of finish. Most players use the \"handi helper\", or \"auto-cap\" feature, which allows the machine to automatically make the selections on the player's behalf.\nPayouts are based on traditional pari-mutuel processes. The player's wager is divvied up into several \"betting pools\" for different winning possibilities, such as picking the winner of the race, picking the top three finishers in exact order, or any of the three selections finishing first and second. The machine then shows a replay of all or a portion of the race. If the player achieved a particular type of \"win\", he receives the money from that pool, while the money in each of the other pools continues to accumulate until another bettor wins it.\nEarly versions of Instant Racing terminals closely resembled self-serve wagering terminals. Later terminals began to mimic slot machines, with symbols on spinning reels corresponding to the results of the player's wager, and the video of the race occupying only a 2-inch square in the corner of the display. Some versions show a computer-animated re-enactment of the race rather than a video.\nHistory.\nThe idea of historical race wagering was conceived by Eric Jackson, general manager of Oaklawn Park. He brought the idea to three major companies in January 1997, but found no takers. Later in the year, he met with Ted Mudge, president of AmTote, who liked the idea and asked Jackson to present it to experts at a February 1998 racing industry gathering in Maryland. The project gathered momentum from there. The Arkansas General Assembly took steps in 1999 to authorize Instant Racing by removing the requirement that simulcast races be shown live. A test deployment was launched in January 2000 at Oaklawn Park and Southland Greyhound Park, with 50 machines at each track. The machines proved popular and Jackson reported that as many as a dozen other tracks were pursuing approval to install the machines within two months of the test.\nBy state.\nAlabama.\nHistorical horse racing machines are in operation at three former greyhound racing tracks in Alabama, Birmingham Race Course Casino, Greene County Entertainment, and Victoryland.\nThe state attorney general opined in 2001 and 2008 that HHR machines could be legal under existing parimutuel wagering laws. HHR machines were first installed in 2019 at Birmingham Race Course. They came into broader use after unfavorable court rulings forced the removal of electronic bingo machines at some facilities, arriving in 2022 at the Greene County track, and then in 2023 at Victoryland.\nIdaho.\nThe Idaho Legislature legalized Instant Racing in 2013, and machines were soon installed at Les Bois Park, Greyhound Park, and the Double Down Bar &amp; Grill in Idaho Falls. State legislators then enacted a ban on the machines in early 2015, claiming they had been misled about the game's nature, but the ban was vetoed by Governor Butch Otter. However, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, which operates a casino that competes with the racetracks, successfully sued to invalidate Otter's veto, and the ban went into effect in September 2015, resulting in the shutdown of the state's historical racing parlors. A ballot initiative to re-legalize the machines, Proposition 1, was rejected by voters in 2018.\nKansas.\nKansas legislators enacted a historical racing law in 2022, authorizing one license for a facility in the Wichita area with up to 1,000 machines. The license was granted to the proposed Golden Circle project, to open at the former Wichita Greyhound Park in Park City in 2024 or 2025.\nKentucky.\nThe Kentucky Horse Racing Commission modified its definition of parimutuel wagering in July 2010 to allow Instant Racing, and at the same time asked a court to review whether the change was legal. The court approved the changes and anti-gambling activists appealed the decision. The anti-gambling activists' appeal reached the Kentucky Supreme Court, which ruled in February 2014 that the Horse Racing Commission could authorize parimutuel wagering on historical races, but remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether the terminals meet the definition of parimutuel wagering. In 2020, the Supreme Court finally ruled that at least the Exacta Systems product was not parimutuel. The next year, however, state legislators updated the definition of parimutuel wagering to explicitly allow historical horse racing, citing its importance to the state's racing industry.\nEven while the legal fight unfolded, Kentucky Downs installed Instant Racing terminals in September 2011, Ellis Park followed suit a year later, and the Red Mile opened a historical racing parlor in partnership with Keeneland in September 2015. Derby City Gaming, a standalone historical racing parlor, opened in 2018. As of 2021, development was underway on a historical racing parlor at Turfway Park and on a second Derby City Gaming location.\nLouisiana.\nIn 2021, Louisiana lawmakers authorized historical racing at off-track betting parlors, with up to 50 machines per location.\nNebraska.\nNebraska has seen several attempts to legalize the machines. The Nebraska Legislature voted to authorize the machines in 2012, but the bill was vetoed by Governor Dave Heineman. The legislature then approved a state constitutional amendment in 2014 to allow historical racing, but it was struck from the ballot by the Nebraska Supreme Court based on a technicality. The state racing commission attempted in 2018 to approve the machines, but backed off after Attorney General Doug Peterson argued that the move was unconstitutional.\nNew Hampshire.\nIn 2021, New Hampshire legalized historic horse racing machines at charitable gaming facilities. By 2023, machines were up and running at eight locations. The largest operation in the state, The Brook, has 505 machines and accounts for 41% of the state's HHR revenue.\nOregon.\nThe Oregon Racing Commission approved Instant Racing machines at the state's racetracks in April 2003. Twenty units were installed at Multnomah Greyhound Park the next month. The terminals were moved to Portland Meadows in October. They were removed in November 2003 at the direction of the tracks' parent company, Magna Entertainment. The Commission in 2006 approved a request from Magna to bring the game back to Portland Meadows, but then reversed itself a year later under pressure from Attorney General Hardy Myers, who believed the machines to be illegal.\nThe state enacted a new law legalizing Instant Racing in June 2013, and the game was relaunched at Portland Meadows in February 2015. Portland Meadows closed in 2019.\nAnother horse track, Grants Pass Downs, sought to open a historical racing parlor with 225 machines. Their application was denied after the state Department of Justice determined that the latest generation of machines were games of chance rather than parimutuel betting, and therefore would violate the state constitution's prohibitions against casinos and private lotteries.\nTexas.\nThe Texas Racing Commission adopted rules in August 2014 to allow historical wagering at the state's horse and dog tracks. However, in November 2014, a judge struck down the new rules, finding that historical wagering was a new type of wagering not authorized by existing statutes. The decision was appealed, but the Commission, under strong pressure from state legislators, repealed the historical wagering rules before the appeal could be decided.\nVirginia.\nVirginia enacted a law to allow historical wagering in April 2018, in an effort to make it economically viable to reopen the state's only horse track, Colonial Downs. The racetrack's historical racing parlor opened in April 2019, with additional machines to follow at several off-track betting parlors around the state, branded as Rosie's Gaming Emporium.\nWyoming.\nInstant Racing machines were installed at Wyoming's four off-track betting parlors beginning in July 2003, after approval of the Wyoming Pari-Mutuel Commission. The machines' legality was soon called into question by the state Attorney General, and they were removed in 2005 following a court ruling. The Wyoming Supreme Court ultimately ruled them illegal in 2006, calling the game \"a slot machine that attempts to mimic traditional pari-mutuel wagering\". In 2013, the state legislature re-legalized Instant Racing. By December 2016, machines were in operation at 14 betting parlors across the state."

He was the head coach of the Manhattan Jaspers from 1946 to 1968.\nNicknamed \"Red\", Norton played high school baseball and basketball at Jamaica High School in Queens, and played college basketball under coach Clair Bee at Long Island University (LIU). Norton received a bachelor's degree from LIU, and a master's degree from New York University. He played basketball professionally for the New York Jewels of the American Basketball League. Prior to taking the job at Manhattan, Norton spent four seasons as the head coach at the La Salle Military Academy in Oakdale, New York. He served in the Navy during World War II.\nNorton coached Manhattan to a 300–205 record, winning six conference championships and leading the team to eleven postseason appearances, including two Division I National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and six National Invitation Tournament (NIT) tourneys. At the time of his death, \"The New York Times\" reported that he was the top winning coach in the school's history. His 1957–58 team upset the top seed West Virginia Mountaineers, led by Jerry West, in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In the early 1950s Norton guided one of his players, Junius Kellogg, in initiating and assisting an investigation that led to the uncovering of substantial point shaving activity that was taking place in college basketball at the time. Kellogg had been approached by former Manhattan players Hank Poppe and Jack Byrnes to fix games.\nAfter stepping away from coaching basketball, Norton, who also coached baseball and golf at Manhattan, stayed on as the school’s athletic director until his retirement in 1979. In 1977, he led the Jaspers to the Metropolitan Golf Association (MGA) Intercollegiate Championship. \nNorton was inducted into the Jasper Hall of Fame in 1989.\nNorton died in 1996 at age 82 in Hendersonville, North Carolina."

        "title": "Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Oslo 2022 Winter Olympics was a campaign by the private organization Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports for the right to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in Oslo, although in Norway it was primarily viewed as an application by the Olympic movement for government funding of an Olympic Games that would ultimately be decided by the Norwegian Parliament. The Olympic organisations had already indicated a strong desire that Norway would host the games and provide the necessary funding. Oslo was described as the clear favourite to host the games in international media and was widely expected to be awarded the games, provided that the Norwegian Parliament granted the necessary funding.\nPublic opinion was strongly against granting government funding to an Olympics after a series of demands by the International Olympic Committee for luxury treatment of the committee members themselves were revealed in Norwegian media. The demands included special lanes on roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. The IOC also \"demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo\" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because Norway is a liberal democracy where the government doesn't own or control \"all advertising space throughout Oslo\" and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of a city and the private property within it. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; \"Slate\" described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\"\nThe Olympic movement's bid for government funding was cancelled on October 1, 2014, after the parliamentary caucus of the Conservative Party had voted to decline the application for funding. Already, the Progress Party, Centre Party and Socialist Left Party were opposed to the bid. Thus, it was no longer possible to get a parliamentary majority for a state guarantee. Ole Berget, deputy minister in the Finance Ministry, said \"the IOC's arrogance was an argument held high by a lot of people.\" The country's largest newspaper commented that \"Norway is a rich country, but we don't want to spend money on wrong things, like satisfying the crazy demands from IOC apparatchiks. These insane demands that they should be treated like the king of Saudi Arabia just won't fly with the Norwegian public.\"\nThe IOC selected Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics from the two remaining bids at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 31, 2015.\nBackground.\nThe Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, a private organization, originally planned a bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Three cities announced interest: Tromsø, Trondheim and Oslo. After assessing the plans and a technical evaluation, the NOC board voted 7–6 in favor of Tromsø. However, 30 September 2008 an external revision demonstrated the games would cost far more than originally suggested, the total public net cost being estimated at 19,1 billions NOK. This prompted the Norwegian Olympic Committee to withdraw the bid 6 October 2008, citing inter alia responsibility to avoid unwarranted public spending. The decision caused strong negative reactions. Then board member and later president, Børre Rognlien, recognized in 2014 that citing responsibility of public spending was unwise.\nIn January 2010, Gerhard Heiberg, IOC member from Norway, announced that the IOC would welcome a bid from Norway to host the Winter Olympic Games. Lillehammer, host of the 1994 Winter Olympics, and the area Stavanger-Bergen-Voss were considered contenders. Tromsø also showed interest. However, Oslo was selected without much public deliberation in October 2011 after the seven major winter sports organizations decided to back the capital. There were negative reactions from several supporters of the Tromsø 2018 bid. MP Anne Marit Bjørnflaten suggested that Tromsø 2018 was cancelled not due to timing or costs, but geography. On 9 June 2012, the annual assembly of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports voted in favor of the Oslo 2022 bid with a majority of 142–15.\nOslo City Council decided to hold a local public referendum on whether or not the city would move forward with the bid. This was held in Oslo on 9 September 2013. The bid was supported by a majority of 55%. Around the same time, the Socialist Left decided not to back the bid, the first political party to adopt a position on a national level.\nApplication for state funding and financial guarantee.\nThe pivotal issue in pushing the bid forward was obtaining state funding and an unlimited state financial guarantee, as required by the Olympic Charter. 19 June 2013, the Norwegian Olympic Committee and Oslo had put forward their application for funding and guarantee to the Ministry of Culture (Norway). Eventually the cabinet would have to present the issue to the Norwegian parliament, Storting, as the constitution gives the parliament power of the budget. The application for state funding was put through a legally required quality assurance review. DNV GL conducted the assessment. On December 20, 2013 they presented their conclusion in which they concluded that the bid was without significant weaknesses, and that the public net costs would probably end on 21,7 billion NOK, and with 85% certainty below 25,8 billion NOK. The next step following the review of DNV GL was to have the Ministry of Culture forward the application to the parliament. Before this was executed, the bid had been withdrawn.\nApplicant city phase.\nOn 12 November 2013, Oslo sent their formal letter to be an \"applicant city\" in the bidding for the 2022 games. Oslo was joined by five other cities: Beijing, Almaty, Stockholm, Kraków and Lviv. However, Stockholm dropped out of the race two months later due to lack of local political support.\nBørre Rognlien had initially stated that the Norwegian Olympic Committee required public support of 60% of the population to move forward with the bid. This was also presented as a requirement from IOC. However, building public support proved hard. Just prior to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, support was lagging at 38%. Despite being a success in medals, the Sochi games was a further hit for the Oslo bid. Controversies around IOC reprimanding the Norwegian cross country skiers for wearing mourning bands, as well as general criticism concerning costs and other issues made support drop even further. Shortly after Sochi, a poll suggested that support had dropped to 32,6%.\n9 March 2014, former leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, Hans B. Skaset, explained how the Olympic Charter secured IOC control of the event, while leaving the financial risk with the host city. The minister of culture, Thorhild Widvey, responded by declaring that the Norwegian government would reserve itself against the relevant provisions of the Olympic Charter. Oslo sent the candidate application file March 14. The Norwegian minister of culture, Thorhild Widvey, did not – as IOC require – provide a full guarantee of respecting the Olympic Charter. Instead, Widvey wrote that their guarantee should \"not be understood to mean that the Government has agreed to comply with all provisions of the Olympic Charter\". However, this was withdrawn by the end of April after a short exchange of letters with the IOC, who rejected such a reservation.\n4 May 2014, the Progress Party (junior coalition partner in government) voted no to provide a state financial guarantee for the Olympic bid at their annual conference. Prime Minister Erna Solberg declared the following day that this did not affect the governments assessment of whether or not to support the bid. In response to the decision of the Progress Party, Thorhild Widvey went public with her support of the bid 15 May 2014. By summer, two other applicant cities (Kraków and Lviv) had withdrawn their bids, leaving Oslo, Beijing and Almaty as the only applicant cities.\nCandidate city phase and rejection of the Olympic organizations' application.\nOslo, Beijing and Almaty were accepted as Candidate Cities by the IOC on 7 July 2014. The IOC's working group report gave Oslo the highest technical ratings of the three cities. The Norwegian capital led in eight of the 14 categories and was tied with Beijing in three.\nWith pollings in June 2014 running as low as 29% and 24%, the requirement of 60% support, which Børre Rognlien had previously set, was retracted. During the summer, the bid was able to gain backing from key public figures: the leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, Gerd Kristiansen, as well as the leader of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, Kristin Skogen Lund, both went public with their support of the bid. Oslo 2022 was also supported by the Norwegian Young Conservatives. However, the youth divisions of the other seven major political parties opposed the bid.\nThorhild Widvey had not informed the public that the reservation towards the Olympic Charter had been withdrawn, but this became known at the beginning of August, causing considerable adverse reactions. On 4 September 2014, in an attempt to drum up support both in public and in parliament, Oslo 2022 presented a cheaper option for hosting the Games, which would reduce the net cost to the public purse from 21,7 billion NOK to 17,4 billion NOK. However, Oslo 2022 were still standing by their original proposal and recommendations.\nAs an alleged strategic move to establish a \"yes\" vote in the caucus of the Conservative Party, to facilitate the cabinet in supporting the bid, the caucus elected to discuss the bid in early October, prior to the cabinet taking a position. According to several media sources, the parliamentary caucus had a solid majority in favour of the bid at this point. However, in the last couple of days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party, there was a series of negative developments for the bid, including: the Centre Party saying \"no\" through a grass root vote; a poll showing that even within the Norwegian Confederation of Sports, the majority of members opposed the bid; and an external revision which clarified that the revised cheaper budget was unrealistic. The most damaging development was the public scrutiny of the IOC's 7000 pages of requirements. An exposé by the Norwegian tabloid \"Verdens Gang\" allegedly revealed extravagant hospitality demands made by the IOC. They included a cocktail reception with the royal family with drinks paid for by them or the organising committee, the provision of road lanes exclusively for use by IOC members, and priority treatment at airports and hotels being used by IOC members. IOC also \"demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo\" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because Norway is a liberal democracy where the government doesn't own or control \"all advertising space throughout Oslo\" much of which is privately owned and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of an entire city and private property within it. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy, while \"Slate\" described them as being \"diva-like\".\nThe discussions of the caucus were held in private, after which the parliamentary leader Trond Helleland explained that the caucus was divided roughly down the middle. The conclusion of the caucus was that this was not an adequate basis for moving forward with the bid, hence their recommendation to the cabinet was to reject the application for a state guarantee and state funding. Various members of the Conservative Party cited lack of public support and enthusiasm, high costs and unreasonable IOC demands as the main reasons for the caucus' negative decision. The conclusion meant that a majority of the members of parliament were now opposed to the bid, leading Oslo 2022 to withdraw its application for state funding and financial guarantee. No single party had supported the bid at the national level, but the Labour Party (Norway), Liberal Party (Norway) and Christian Democratic Party (Norway) remained undecided throughout the process.\nAftermath.\nImmediately following the bid withdrawal, IOC released a statement on Oslo 2022 calling it a \"missed opportunity\" for Norway. The statement also included strong criticism of the bid leadership and government, claiming that \"neither a senior member of the bid team nor a government official\" attended a meeting held by IOC to clarify important issues concerning the games. IOC claimed \"senior politicians in Norway appear not to have been properly briefed on the process and were left to take their decisions on the basis of half-truths and factual inaccuracies\". Bid chair Stian Berger Røsland rejected these claims, calling IOC \"arrogant\". Thorhild Widvey dubbed the IOC claims as \"very sensational\", stating that the IOCs claims were not genuine. \"We have not been invited to a meeting\", Widvey added. Conservative MP Svein Harberg, a prominent supporter of the bid, commented the attack from IOC stating \"I was quite shocked about this at first (...) I was angry when I looked at it. But now I realize that it just shows we made the right decision.\"\nThe Oslo City Council was presented with an evaluation of the bid process December 2014. CEO of Oslo 2022, Eli Grimsby, presented the evaluation with the main conclusion that the distance between the spirit of the Norwegian people and the olympic movement was too large. Grimsby further stated that the major challenges were in connection with the Host City Contract, which she labelled unbalanced, and as putting too much a burden on the host city. The Norwegian Confederation of Sports also initiated an evaluation on its own. The results were presented 25 March 2015. The evaluation concluded among other things that the bid suffered from poor communication, bad organization, and lack of support on the grass root level of the sporting confederation.\nThe DOSB also criticized the withdrawal of candidacy with the following statement:\n\"We regret that Oslo is no longer eligible for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The city, with its great winter sports tradition, had what we think was a convincing and sustainable concept. With the decision, another excellent candidate for the 2022 Winter Olympics will be lost. Now we are relying on the reform process within the framework of the Olympic Agenda 2020.\"\nTechnical details of the bid.\nFinancial details.\nIn the application for state funding and financial guarantee, Oslo 2022 calculated gross total costs at 33,7 billion NOK. The external quality control review increased the estimate to up to 35,1 billion NOK with 50% certainty, and up to 41,0 billion NOK with 85% certainty. Those numbers may not accurately reflect what would have been the final number. Generally, the Norwegian quality control system have shown a bias at underestimating costs. In addition, a study at Saïd Business School showed that the Olympics had a 100 percent consistency of cost overruns in the period 1960–2012, with the average cost overrun in real terms at 179%. In the period 1999–2012, the average cost overrun is lower, in real terms at 47%.\nThe 21,7 billion net cost was based on 7 700 million NOK in income, and a total of 29 360 million NOK in public expenditure. The public expenditure included an organizational budget for the organizational committee of 17 510 million NOK, of which 2 800 million NOK was costs of renting the olympic village, media center and media village. 5 070 million NOK were budgeted spent on construction investment. 2 050 million NOK were budgeted in non-organization committee operational costs. 1 330 million NOK were budgeted to cover wage increases, while 3 420 million NOK were set aside to cover uncertainty of cost overruns.\nDNV GL also conducted a socio-economical assessment, concluding that for the economy overall the games overall led to a negative net result of 15 890 million NOK in monetary terms. Of the positive non-monetary effects, enjoyable events and the predicted nationwide enthusiasm was considered the most significant. Non-monetary effects aside, the games would leave a legacy with a socio-economical worth of 2,45 billion NOK. This included mainly sporting venues (1 100 million NOK), infrastructure improvement (510 million NOK) and investment in security equipment (660 million NOK). Aside from the legacy, the difference between the public net cost of 21,7 billion NOK and the overall negative net result of 15,89 billion NOK consisted mainly of discounting the future cost to present value (3 930 million NOK) and positive effects for the tourism industry valued at 1 780 million NOK. The review considered the socio-economic costs of tax financing the event to 3 000 million NOK. The effects for the tourism industry were contested in the public debate, as research gives little support of a correlation between hosting the olympics and increased tourism. In the socio-economical assessment, the quality control review removed an alleged 4,9 billion NOK in positive effects of improved health in the population, finding no basis for the claim that hosting the olympics increases physical activity in the population.\nVenues.\nThe Oslo 2022 proposal included existing venues around Oslo itself, with a goal of hosting as many events as possible, including snow events, within Oslo's city limits. Certain Alpine events would be held in Lillehammer, which had hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. Several new venues would also be constructed, and Valle Hovin would be renovated into an indoor arena. The following is the list of proposed venues for both the \"Oslo Zone\" and \"Lillehammer Zone\".\nAccommodation.\nIOC requires 23,300 beds for accredited people (such as participants, leaders, journalists). This requirement is a little more than the hotel overall capacity of Oslo, Lillehammer and their surrounding areas. Since spectators and other Olympic-related visitors would have to be accommodated, more rooms would be needed. As a result, there were plans to arrange for there to be at least 3,000 additional temporary beds for visitors.\nTransport.\nOlympic visitors would arrive at Oslo Airport, which receives intercontinental flights. Road and rail connections to all venues in the Lillehammer area would be provided, including a four-lane motorway between Oslo and Lillehammer (route E6).\nPrevious bids.\nOslo bid to host the 1932 and 1944 Winter Olympics but lost to Lake Placid and Cortina d'Ampezzo respectively (the 1944 games were cancelled because of World War II). Oslo went on to successfully bid to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. The city later bid to host the 1968 Winter Olympics but lost to Grenoble.\nPrevious bids from other Norwegian cities.\nLillehammer bid to host the 1992 Winter Olympics but lost to Albertville. Lillehammer successfully bid to host the 1994 Winter Olympics. The city also bid to host the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics but failed to become a candidate (the games were ultimately awarded to Innsbruck). Lillehammer went on to submit an uncontested bid for the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics."

        "title": "2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony",
        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics took place at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Russia, on 7 February 2014. It began at 20:14 MSK () and finished at 23:02 MSK (). It was filmed and produced by OBS and Russian host broadcasters Channel One and VGTRK. This was the first Winter Olympics and first Olympic Games opening ceremony under the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach. This was also the second consecutive Winter Olympic opening ceremony to be held in an indoor stadium.\nThe Games were officially opened by President Vladimir Putin. An audience of 40,000 were in attendance at the stadium with an estimated 2,000 performers.\nPreparations.\nThe site of the opening ceremony, Fisht Olympic Stadium was built specifically for the games. Fisht Stadium seats 40,000. No Olympic or Paralympic competitions were held there; it was only used for the opening and closing ceremonies during the respective Games. Television producer Konstantin Ernst was the main Creative Head in charge of the opening ceremonies. Andrei Nasonovsky was the Executive Producer of record; and Andrei Boltenko was the writer and director of the ceremony. A different team was in charge of the Closing Ceremony as well as the Paralympic ceremonies.\nProgramme.\nPre-ceremony activities included performances by the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. and the Ministry of Internal Affairs choir, who performed a version of Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\".\nDreams of Russia.\nThe ceremony, opened with an on-screen video showing 11-year-old Liza Temnikova playing a character named Lyubov (Russian for 'love') reciting the Russian alphabet. Each letter is associated with images of a famous Russian person or landmark. Many of the letters features some of Russia's most famous writers such as Dostoyevsky, Nabokov, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and countless others that have impacted Russian history, culture, literature, and philosophy.\nLyubov then flew into the air as she dreamed of grabbing the tail of a kite and being lifted far off the stage. Nine different floats, carrying Russian landscapes, passed beneath her as she slept.\nFive large snowflakes descended into the stadium which expanded and joined to form the Olympic rings. However, a technical error caused the fifth ring not to expand, and pyrotechnics did not go off from the rings. The mishap was later self-mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand.\nAnthems.\nThe Sretensky Monastery men's choir sang the Russian National Anthem, while 240 volunteers stood in formation wearing glowing suits of white, red, and blue to represent the Russian flag. The Russian flag bearers were a detachment of cosmonauts — Fyodor Yurchikhin (who returned from space with the torch), Roman Romanenko, Svetlana Savitskaya and Yelena Serova – and the flag was raised by Sergei Krikalev. The volunteers moved up and down to create a waving flag motion.\nParade of Nations.\nThe Parade of Nations was led, according to custom due to hosting the original ancient Olympics, by the Greek team, followed by other competing countries in alphabetical order based on their names in the Russian language, with the host country, Russia, culminating the march. Athletes were then seated in the lower level of the stadium's stands. A projected rendering of the Earth showing each competing country (along with their names in English, French and Russian, respectively) was displayed on the stadium floor as they entered. The parade was accompanied with a soundtrack by Russian electronic dance music producer Leonid Rudenko, which featured remixes of popular Russian music.\nMascots.\nAfter the Parade of Nations entered, the three mascots of the Games come out and walk on an ice-based shaping rink LED of the stadium. The hare is an alpine skier, the leopard and the polar bear are the skiers using skating rink shoes. The mascots bow quickly then head off for the next segment.\nPerformances.\nThe opening ceremony focused heavily on classical music and large scale productions. Performances journeyed through Russian history through the eyes of a little girl called Lyubov (\"Love\"), played by Liza Temnikova, touching on Russia's art, music, and ballet. The Russian history presentation was ushered in by a brightly-lit troika of three horses followed by a red sun. Performances included the building of St Basil's Cathedral, represented by colourful inflatable sculptures, and 17th century czar Peter the Great building an army as Russia transitioned from medieval times to the 20th century. Czar Peter's marching cadets (160 male dancers) moved from a map of the St Petersburg projected on the stadium floor to an imperial ball inspired by Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", and featuring ballet dancers including Danila Korsuntsev, Ivan Vasiliev, and Svetlana Zakharova. The ball included music by Aleksander Sergeyevich Zatsepin and ended with the fifth movement (Rondo) of Alfred Schnittke's \"Concerto Grosso No. 1\".\nFourteen columns rose from the floor, then disappeared, replaced first by scenes of the Russian Revolution and Soviet industrialization, followed by a giant moving reproduction of the famous statue \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\" made by Vera Mukhina in 1937, with hammer and sickle flying over the arena, symbolising the period of great industrialisation following the Bolshevik Revolution.\nDozens of men carried rockets and the name of Yuri Gagarin appeared on the floor, followed up skyscrapers emerging against a background of modern typography.\nThe organizing committee initially wanted to include scenes of Soviet victory in the World War Two, but the IOC protested and the plans were abandoned.\nPutin declared the games open, followed by a performance of \"Swan Lake\" in which the Swans, holding strands of blue LED lights, transformed into the Dove of Peace, a traditional Olympic symbol. Prima ballerina Diana Vishneva was among those who performed.\nMany performers wore white to symbolise peace. More than 3,000 performers and 2,000 volunteers took part in the show. 10,000 people in all helped organise and execute the ceremonies. 120 projectors and 2.6 million lumens turned the stadium floor into a 3D, moving landscape.\nOath and torch lighting.\nThe Olympic flag was brought into the stadium with eight flag bearers: Chulpan Khamatova, Lidiya Skoblikova, Anastasia Popova, Valentina Tereshkova, Viacheslav Fetisov, Valery Gergiev, Alan Enileev and Nikita Mikhalkov. During the flag raising, opera singer Anna Netrebko later sang the Olympic Anthem in Russian.\nThe Olympic Oath on behalf of all athletes was taken by Ruslan Zakharov (Short-track), Vyacheslav Vedenin took the oath for all judges and Anastasia Popkova took the oath for all coaches.\nFor the finale, tennis player Maria Sharapova brought the Olympic Torch (the torch that had gone to the International Space Station in November) into the stadium. She handed it off to pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, handing the torch to him. Tretiak jogged out of the stadium alongside Rodnina. The pair then jointly lit the Olympic cauldron installed at the Sochi Medals Plaza in Sochi Olympic Park to the music of the \"Firebird Suite\" by Igor Stravinsky. Gas jets led the Olympic flame to the top of the Olympic Cauldron. This was followed by a fireworks display across the area around Fisht Olympic Stadium, including the other sporting venues. Twenty-two tonnes of fireworks were lit as Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker\" score played. In total, the show lasted just under three hours.\nMusic.\nThe music for the winning bid was composed by Eric Babak with the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra with\nthe State Academic Choral Chapel of Russia.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe malfunction of the fifth Olympic snowflake ring was not seen during the telecast of the ceremony in Russia, where both Channel One and VGTRK quickly cut to footage of the scene from a dress rehearsal, where the sequence worked correctly.\nIn the United States, NBC's broadcasts of the opening ceremony were delayed until evening hours. The broadcast attracted 31.7 million American viewers, compared to 32.6 million for the live telecast of the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\nIn Britain, BBC Two's coverage of the ceremony attracted a peak 3.2 million viewers and an average rating of 2.47 million.\nBBM Canada ratings for CBC's live, repeat and online broadcasts of the ceremony totalled 6.974 million viewers.\nIn Australia, Ten broadcast the ceremony at 3 am AEDT.\nReception.\n\"The Independent\"'s Simon Rice found some portions of the ceremony to be \"confusing\" and other \"spectacular\", while describing the cauldron lighting as \"an unimaginative domino of flames\". \"The New York Times\" review described the proceedings as \"sheer pageantry and national pride\". Katherine Monk of Canada's Postmedia News described the athletes' clothing as \"a lot sexier than the old Communist-era cardboard garb\". Kathy Lally and Will Englund of \"The Washington Post\" commented that \"The scale bordered on the colossal\" and called the ceremony \"poetry – in motion\".\nDespite Russia's stance on LGBT people (including its 2013 law banning the distribution of LGBT \"propaganda\" to minors, which had been a major concern leading up to the Olympics), the \"Huffington Post\" noted that the opening ceremony, ironically, featured tributes to \"some of history's most widely acclaimed and definitely gay Russians\", including composer Peter Tchaikovsky (1840–1893), ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky (1889–1950), and patron of arts, and founder of Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev. Russian organizers denied any connection, stating that these figures were selected because of their cultural significance. On the same topic, critics also noted the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u were invited to perform during the opening ceremony; although they are not actually lesbian, the all-female duo were well known for incorporating themes of lesbianism in their music and on-stage personas (live appearances often featured the singers kissing each other), its name is a corruption of a shortened Russian phrase meaning \"this girl loves that girl\", and the duo made a statement in support of LGBT rights in the wake of Yuri Luzhkov's objection to the 2007 Moscow Pride parade. Organizers noted that t.A.T.u were chosen because they were well known to an international audience, denying any relation to LGBT rights.\nDignitaries in attendance.\nAside from athletes and members of the IOC, 5 multilateral leaders and representatives from more than 80 countries (included at least 60 heads of state and government) attended the opening ceremony."

        "title": "Kraków bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Kraków 2022 was a bid by the Polish Olympic Committee to hold the 2022 Winter Olympics in Kraków. On 25 May 2014, the inhabitants of Kraków voted to withdraw the bid in a binding referendum. After that Krakow discontinued the application on 26 May 2014.\nHistory.\nOn 6 March 2010, during a sports facility opening ceremony, Polish President Lech Kaczyński announced that he would like his country to be a candidate for 2022 Winter Olympic Games. A month later, on 10 April 2010, he died in a tragic plane crash, which killed 96 people including him, his wife, and the President of the Polish Olympic Committee. Although most snow sport events can be held in Zakopane, some alpine ski events would have to be held in Slovakia, where higher slopes can be found.\nOn 19 and 20 October 2012, Polish and Slovak NOCs with Kraków city administration had a meeting in which they agreed to submit the bid possibly in 2013 and formed an official alliance. The idea has had an initial acceptance by the Polish government. On 10 May 2013 the Sejm of the Republic of Poland in a vote gave support to the possible bid. On 29 March 2014 Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Development, said that the central government would only finance those Games-related infrastructure projects that are planned anyway, independently of the Games. The remaining costs, including sport facilities and the Olympic village, would need to be financed by local authorities.\nKraków confirmed their joint bid with Jasná, Slovakia to host the 2022 Winter Olympics on November 7, 2013.\nInitial opinion polls commissioned by Kraków city authorities returned results in favour of holding the Games. A majority of 68% of participants in a public opinion poll held in June 2013 among Kraków's residents supported the bid, with 25% being against. However, the poll was held before any information on planned spending was made publicly available and before any objections were raised in wider public debate. Opinion polls conducted between 28 October and 2 November 2013 with a sample size of 2,000 respondents throughout Poland resulted in 81% responses in favour across Poland, 79% in Małopolska and 66% in Kraków.\nLater opinion polls put public support for holding the Games under doubt. A poll realised by Homo Homini polling center among respondents throughout Poland on 31 March 2014 has indicated that 52% of respondents oppose the Games, 32% are in favour and 16% have no opinion. Another nationwide opinion poll realised for the Polish Radio on 28 April 2014 confirmed that the majority of Poles oppose the Games, with 58,4% against and 32% in favour of holding the Olympic Games in Kraków. A citywide poll in Krakow realised by Lovekrakow.pl news website gave 36,3% answers supporting the Games with 63,7% being against. In difference to previous polls from 2013, polls from 2014 were commissioned by news agencies without any interest in holding the Games, not by Kraków local authorities or the bid committee which both have a clear pro-Games agenda. They were ultimately confirmed by the vote in a local referendum on 25 May 2014.\nIn late 2013 and early 2014 opposition against Krakow's bid for Olympic Games has gathered momentum. As of 30 March 2014, \"Kraków Przeciwko Igrzyskom\" (\"Krakow Against Games\") initiative has won support of over 17,300 Facebook users and gathered over 7900 signatures under an online petition calling for referendum over the bid. Main concerns raised by the critics are expected exorbitant costs, likely cost overruns and the resulting rise in Krakow's debt, as well as the need to build sport facilities of little use beyond the games, in contrast to limited interest of Krakow city authorities in spending public money to improve the quality of life of the population. It has been brought to attention in the national press that the overall economic benefits of holding Olympic games are doubtful, local and national public authorities are almost always laden with excessive debt in result, while the only parties actually benefitting from the Games seem to be the International Olympic Committee and national committees. Criticism voiced by opponents of the Games was partly confirmed already when the Games application has been lodged in mid-March 2014. In difference to previous estimates, the Games application does not include several previously planned transport infrastructure projects, while spending on sport facilities is to be significantly higher than previously planned.\nEven though the bid was still in early stages, in February 2014 the bid committee has already drawn much criticism in the national press for employing staff (financed from public money) according to unclear criteria, questionable spending on promotional activities including TV spots and a visit by city officials to the Sochi Olympic Games, as well as awarding the contract for preparation of the Games application to a company involved in the 2010 Commonwealth Games corruption scandal. All the cited allegations were later responded by the bid committee.\nKraków's Games application has been lodged on 22 March 2014. Its contents were leaked to the press and published on the internet. The application was criticised for misinforming the International Olympic Committee on climatic and environmental conditions, in particular for failing to provide true information on catastrophic air pollution in both Kraków and Zakopane.\nFurther controversies arise from the planned location of the Krakow Olympic Park, in particular of the Olympic Village. Its construction would require converting a significant part of the Park Lotników and adjacent green areas into a build-up area with high-rise construction. The envisaged location would involve a reduction of green space despite its crucial importance for Krakow in view of its appalling air pollution record (third most polluted city in the EU).\nOn 9 April 2014 it was disclosed that Andrzej Walczak, husband of the chairperson of the bid committee Jagna Marczułajtis-Walczak (although himself with no official position in the bid committee), had negotiated to pay journalists for positive coverage of the Games bid. Following widespread reporting of the scandal in the press, Jagna Marczułajtis-Walczak resigned from the bid committee on 12 April.\nLocal referendum and withdrawal.\nIn a marked difference to Munich, Graubünden and Oslo, Krakow city council had initially rejected the proposal to submit Krakow's bid to a referendum. Only following increasing opposition, on 24 March 2014 Kraków mayor Jacek Majchrowski changed his previous opinion and promised that the bid would be submitted to a referendum. Three more question were added by Krakow city council and finally the vote covered four issues: Krakow's Olympic bid, plans to build a metro system, increased monitoring by CCTV cameras and increased spending on bicycle paths. The referendum was held on 25 May 2014, together with the European Parliament election. According to Polish law, the result of a local referendum is binding if 30% of eligible voters cast their votes. This criterion was met, as the participation rate was 35,96%. Krakow's bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics was rejected by a majority of 69,72% of the voters. Other questions were answered positively by a majority of voters, with the biggest support of 85,20% for increased spending on bicycle paths.\nOn 26 May 2014, mayor of Krakow, Jacek Majchrowski explained that in view of the negative result of the referendum Krakow would withdraw its bid for the Winter Olympics.\nPrevious and future events.\nBig events in Kraków.\nIn 2000 Kraków were chosen by the European Union as the European Capital of Culture. In 2012, during UEFA European Championship none of the events were held in Kraków, although English, Dutch and Italian teams chose the city as their base-camp. Kraków Arena will be one of the venues hosting the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship tournament. Kraków also bid to host events of 2015 European Capital of Sport (lost to Turin). In 2016 World Youth Day will be organized, with approximately 1 million expected attendance. In the same year 2016 European Men's Handball Championship will be co-organised in Kraków.\nWinter sport events in Zakopane.\nZakopane hosted Winter Universiade twice: in 1993 and 2001. Regullary FIS Ski Jumping World Cup is organised at the Great Rafter. In 2000 Biathlon European Championships were hosted here as well. In 1929, 1939 and 1962 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships were held in the Zakopane and Tatra Mountains area.\nSignificant sport events in Poland.\nIn 1997 Warsaw hosted World Single Distance Speed Skating Championships and in 2007 European Figure Skating Championships. In 2008 Warsaw were chosen by the European Union as the European Capital of Sport. Upper Silesia organised 2009 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival. Poznań hosted 2011 Women's Indoor Hockey World Cup and 2011 Men's Indoor Hockey World Cup. In 2012 Poland co-host UEFA Euro 2012. Sopot will be host 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Poland will host too the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship. The 2017 World Games were held in Wrocław.\nPrevious bids.\nPrevious bids from other Polish cities.\nZakopane bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate. Turin was ultimately awarded the games.\nPoznań bid to host the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, but failed to become a candidate. Singapore was ultimately awarded the games. Poznan went on to bid for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but lost to Nanjing. Poznan then went on to bid for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, but withdrew the bid. Buenos Aires was ultimately awarded the games.\nPrevious bids by other Slovak cities.\nPoprad bid to host the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate. Salt Lake City and Turin were awarded the 2002 and 2006 games respectively.\nVenues.\nThe proposed venues plan comprises:\nBid logo.\nThe bid logo is inspired from the Polish decorative pattern called parzenica. The yellow square at the center refers to the shape of the Krakow´s old town market square.\nTransport.\nThe main airport would be the John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice located about 17 km from the Main Olympic Village. Direct trains used to cover the route between Kraków Główny train station and the airport in 15 minutes but the connection was suspended in early 2014, because the rail track and stations are being renovated and upgraded. 3,647,616 people used the airport in 2013, giving Kraków Airport 15 percent of all air passenger traffic in Poland. Currently, the airport offers 59 connections and is operated by 2 terminals (international T1 and national T2). The Katowice International Airport is located about 75 minutes from Kraków. The Poprad-Tatry Airport is located from Jasná.\nKraków has no suburban rail system, but there are plans to develop such a system.\nKraków is located on the A4 East-West highway. The road distance from Kraków to Jasná is , at least 2 hours 50 minutes by road in good traffic conditions. The road distance from Kraków to Zakopane is , 1½ hours by road in good traffic conditions. The Kraków-Zakopane road is notorious for traffic jams in high tourist season and during major sporting events. By 2022 the first will probably be expressway (S7)."

Each year the Steam Donkeys play twelve matches in the division III northern California league against Redding, Humboldt County, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, Napa, and Yreka.\nClub Logo.\nThe Steam Donkey moniker is based on a steam-powered winch, or logging engine, as a tribute to the logging history of Mendocino County. It also conveys the hard-hitting style of play the club is known for.\nHistory.\nFounded in 2005, the Mendocino Steam Donkeys Rugby Club started with only eight players. Outside of a few veteran players, many new players did not even know the basic rules of rugby, but with several practices devoted to the intricacies of the sport, that soon changed. Over the years, word about the club spread around the county, sparking interest and bringing players not only from Ukiah, which is the main hub of the club, but from outlying communities as well, from Potter Valley to Willits, Boonville to Hopland, Fort Bragg and Mendocino, stretching as far as Lake County.\nThe Mendocino Steam Donkeys Rugby Club played their first game in 2006.\nCommunity outreach.\nThe club is known for community engagement - especially working with children. In 2013, the club partnered with the Mendocino County Library, to promote children's literacy through \"Rugby Reads\" where the players read to children. Also in 2013, the club collected toys for underprivileged children donating them to the Ukiah Valley Christmas Effort as part of a coalition with service club, the Active 20-30 Club of Ukiah, and roller derby teams Mendo Mayhem and Deep Valley Belligerents."

He organized large-scale baseball operations, consisting of 150 teams in 6 leagues. Playoffs among the teams narrowed them to two finalists – the Casablanca Yankees, consisting of medics, with a season record of 32-2 in the Casablanca-Oran area, and the Algiers Streetwalkers, consisting of MPs, which had been 17-3 in the Algiers-Tunis League.\nThe North African World Series was a best two-out-of-three-game championship played on October 3 and 4, 1943, at St. Eugene municipal stadium in Algiers, Algeria, between the two teams. Attendance at the games was 4,000 people. Major General Everett Hughes, deputy theater commander, threw out the first ball.\nThe Casablanca Yankees won the series in two straight games. They won the first game 9–0, and then won the second game 7–6, after scoring three runs in the bottom of the ninth.\nThe best hitter in the series was Lieutenant Walt Singer, the only officer in the games, who played first base and also served as Casablanca's manager. A former Syracuse University All-American football player, Singer had also played football in the National Football League for the New York Giants. He had five hits, including the sole homer of the series, the pivotal hit in the second game.\nBonura promoted the North African World Series through coverage on the Armed Forces Radio Network. A play-by-play commentary of each game was broadcast by radio to all American military personnel in the Mediterranean theater. Press coverage appeared in the \"Armed Forces Weekly\" and the \"Stars and Stripes\".\nThe winners were presented with baseballs autographed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the winning team received a trophy made from an unexploded Italian bomb."

        "text": "Andre Rishard Williams (born August 28, 1992) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Boston College Eagles. He was a finalist for the 2013 Heisman Trophy, and won the 2013 Doak Walker Award as the nation's best running back. During the 2013 season, Williams became only the 16th player in NCAA history to rush for over 2,000 yards and he finished his college career ranked fifth all-time for most yards rushed in a single season with 2,177 yards. He was selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 2014 NFL draft.\nEarly life and education.\nAdrew Williams was born in Poughkeepsie, New York to Jamaican immigrants Lancelene and Ervin. Williams spent his first year in Jamaica before returning to live in Central Jersey with his parents, sister, and two brothers. His family also lived in Atlanta and Allentown, Pennsylvania. \"By the eighth grade,\" Williams later explained, \"I decided I was going to play Division I football.\" \nAfter transferring from Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Georgia, Williams attended Parkland High School in South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania. As a senior, he had 1,913 rushing yards on 128 carries and 33 touchdowns for the football team. He earned All-State Class AAAA first-team honors as a senior running back and was selected as \"The Morning Call\" Player of the Year. He led Parkland High School to a 10–3 record in 2009.\nIn addition to football, he was also a standout athlete for Parkland High School's track and field team. At the 2010 Pennsylvania 3A state championship, he finished third in the state in the 100 meters with a time of 10.76 seconds and second in the state in the 200 meters with a time of 22.01 seconds. He was also timed at 14.61 seconds in the 110 meter hurdles in 2009.\nIn 2010, Williams was ranked a three-star recruit by Rivals.com and was rated the 44th best running back prospect in the nation. He committed to Boston College over offers from Temple, Akron and Vanderbilt.\nCollege career.\nWilliams attended Boston College, where he played for its Eagles football team from 2010 to 2013. He graduated early with a degree in applied psychology and human development.\nFreshman season.\nWilliams's first three years at Boston College were relatively uneventful. Playing as a true freshman in 2010, Williams showed his potential while sharing the backfield with Montel Harris and Sterlin Phifer. He played in all 13 games, rushing for 461 yards on 95 carries with two touchdowns. In the final regular season game of the year, playing at Syracuse, he set the school record for rushing attempts in a game, running 42 times as the Eagles beat the Orange 16–7.\nSophomore season.\nAs a sophomore in 2011, Williams continued to improve, but played less time with sharing the backfield with Rolandon Finch, Tahj Kimble, and Montel Harris, starting seven of 10 games and rushing for 517 yards on 124 carries with four touchdowns.\nJunior season.\nAs a junior in 2012, he continued to be a reliable option, although for a pass-heavy offense, starting eight of nine games, rushing for 584 yards on 130 carries and four touchdowns. His efforts were mostly in vain though, as the Eagles continued to progressively get worse, winning 7 games in 2010, 4 in 2011, and only 2 in 2012. His three years of experience, however would pave the way for his breakout senior year and a turnaround for the Eagles team.\nSenior season.\nWith a change in coaching during the offseason, Steve Addazio brought in new coordinators and a new style of offense focused heavily on the run. Williams started off the year as a powerful weapon, running for 114 and 204 yards respectively in wins over Villanova and Wake Forest, and scoring once in each game. He had his worst performance of the season against a strong USC defense, managing only 38 yards. However, he bounced back against #8 ranked Florida State and ran for 149 yards as the Eagles nearly upset the eventual National Champions.\nThe following week, during the Homecoming game against Army, Williams exploded offensively, scoring five touchdowns and rushing for 263 yards, only 1 yard shy of the school's single game rushing record. He momentarily tied the record, but unfortunately lost a yard on his last rushing attempt of the game, bringing his total back down. After rushing for only 70 yards at Clemson, he gave two solid performances against UNC and Virginia Tech, rushing for 172 and 166 yards, respectively, and scoring three times. The next week at New Mexico State, Williams managed to break the single game record that he came so close to during the Army game, running for 295 yards and two scores. \nThe following week, playing on senior day, Boston College's final home game of the season against NC State, Williams broke his own record and ran for 339 yards on 42 carries, scoring twice. The performance also surpassed the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) record, previously set at 329 yards by John Leach of Wake Forest in 1993. During the game, he also broke the school's single season record for rushing yards, finishing the day with 1,810 yards. The win made BC bowl eligible for the first time since 2010, and tripled the previous year's win total, prompting the students and fans to rush the field and celebrate with the team following the win. Williams's performance was recognized by media across the country, as he was named the Walter Camp National Player of the Week, as well as ACC offensive back of the week. His successes and statistics as the league's leading rusher made him the front-runner for the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best running back.\nAfter the success against North Carolina State at home, the Eagles took on Maryland for the first of their final two road games of the season. Williams had another big day, running for 263 yards and two scores, passing 2,000 yards and becoming only the 16th player in NCAA history to accomplish this feat. With this achievement, Williams became a part of the Heisman conversation.\nThe final game of the regular season was at 5–6 Syracuse. Unfortunately, Williams re-aggravated a right shoulder injury that he had been dealing with since the UNC game. He left the game early in the 3rd quarter and did not return, having rushed for only 29 yards for the day. Despite the disappointing end to the game, those 29 yards put Williams over 2,100 yards for the season and placed him at 9th all time in the FBS single-season rushing list.\nThe Eagles final game of the season was in the 2013 Independence Bowl against the Arizona Wildcats. The game featured a matchup between the nation's two best running backs in Williams and Arizona's Ka'Deem Carey, who was a consensus All-American in 2012 as well as a finalist for the 2013 Doak Walker award, which Williams won. The game was a blowout win for Arizona, as they cruised to a 42–19 victory. Williams ran for 75 yards in his final contest as a college back, finishing with 2,177 yards on the season, 5th most all-time in the NCAA.\nPostseason awards.\nWilliams was one of six finalists for the Heisman Trophy in 2013, and finished fourth in the voting. He was the winner of the 2013 Doak Walker Award and was named a unanimous All-American. In addition, he was a unanimous first-team All-ACC selection and was also a finalist for the Walter Camp Award.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nThe New York Giants selected Williams in the fourth round with the 113th overall pick of the 2014 NFL draft. He made his NFL debut in the season opener against the Detroit Lions. In the 35–14 loss, he had five carries for nine yards. \nOn September 25, in a 45–14 victory over the Washington Redskins, he scored his first professional rushing touchdown. On December 7, against the Tennessee Titans, he had 24 carries for 131 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 36–7 victory. Overall, he finished his rookie season with 721 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns. His production dipped in his second season as he recorded 88 carries for 257 yards and a rushing touchdown. He was released by the team on September 3, 2016.\nSan Diego/Los Angeles Chargers.\nOn September 4, 2016, the San Diego Chargers claimed Williams off waivers. He was released on September 24, 2016, and was signed to the practice squad two days later. He was promoted to the active roster on December 27, 2016. He appeared in the regular season finale against the Kansas City Chiefs and had 18 carries for 87 rushing yards.\nOn March 9, 2017, the Chargers re-signed Williams. He was waived on September 2, 2017, and was signed to the Chargers' practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on October 7, 2017. In Week 14, Williams suffered a broken wrist on the final play of the game and was ruled out for the rest of the 2017 season. He was placed on injured reserve on December 12, 2017. Overall, he finished the 2017 season with nine carries for 25 yards in eight games.\nHouston Roughnecks.\nWilliams was selected by the Houston Roughnecks of the XFL in the 9th round in the 2020 XFL Draft. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.\nPersonal life.\nSince his college years, Williams has been writing what he calls a \"philosophical memoir\", which is entitled \" A King, a Queen and a Conscience.\" He expects to complete the manuscript in 2015. Williams is also trying to secure a patent for a \"compression shirt\" type of athletic gear that could improve backfield running.\nWilliams married Carolyn Jay, who also attended Boston College, in 2014. His first child, Barron Zavier, was born in February 2016. Six months later, Williams and \nand Jay filed for divorce. In 2018, Williams had a second son, Ka'el Malik, with his long time friend, Deshonia Peavy."

He was again in fine form in 2012, playing all 12 of Otago's games during a campaign that saw them make the Championship final, before being thrashed 41-16 by . 2013 would prove to be his final season with the Razorbacks and it saw him score 3 times in 10 games as the men from Dunedin reached the Championship semi-finals before being defeated 29-24 by .\n2014–2017.\nAfter three years of solid performances at domestic level for Otago, Evans earned a Super Rugby contract with the Dunedin-based ahead of the 2014 season.

A pair of yoked bulls are sent charging down a football field-sized paddy field soaked in ankle deep water, while their handlers boarded on a wooden plank, hang onto the tail or onto a harness and slide through the mud. The fields are freshly ploughed as the bulls are raced by their handlers.\nBull surfing competitions are common in Kerala where local clubs or landlords offer trophies and cash prizes for races with different categories for speed and style. A pair of oxen is usually managed by a participating unit formed by a handler (the surfing member) and a team of people to assist him. Usually 30 to 50 of these units participate in the race that goes on from morning until dusk. Just like the professional jockeys, these participants are well trained and are experts in managing the oxen during the race. The oxen are specifically fed and trained just for the competition. They are also well groomed and horn polished, so they look their best before jumping in the mud. Most participants begin by holding onto the rope attached to the bulls, and move to hang onto the tail when their surfing begins. The races are performed by one team at a time and there will be several rounds to determine which team took the least time to complete one lap within the field. The villagers gather around these fields while keeping a safe distance and chanting and cheering in excitement."

Problems began on the boat journey over, with disputes developing about aspects of the trip and a rift developed between tour manager and coach, Australian Ernest Mair, and seven forwards. The disputes continued once the party arrived in Britain, with one of the rebels being involved in a street fight with another member of the tour party after the opening match. In mid-November, following further disturbances which almost led to the tour party being evicted from their Harrogate hotel, it was decided that coach Mair would withdraw from team selection and match tactics for a period of four weeks. The tour, and the costly disputes, continued with the rebels eventually setting sail for home a week earlier than their colleagues. Three months later all seven players were banned for life by the New Zealand authorities. New Zealand did not visit Europe again until 1939.\nThe seven suspended were Singe, Mouat, Wright, Carroll, Devine, Petersen and English-born Henry, who remained in England after the tour and was allowed to play on by the Rugby Football League.\nFixtures.\nThe New Zealand side played a total of five test matches while on their European tour and one test in New Zealand before leaving.\nAftermath.\nThe \"Auckland All Blacks\" lost to Auckland 24–21 at Carlaw Park in April after the teams return."

Second Spectrum is the current Official Optical Tracking Provider of the NBA and began league-wide tracking in the 2017-18 NBA season, replacing STATS SportVU which previously held the league-wide contract. \nTechnology.\nThe NBA (via Second Spectrum) uses an optical tracking system that leverages multiple cameras placed in the catwalks in all 29 NBA arenas. The cameras receive and update data at a rate of 25 frames per second. The cameras feed the data into proprietary software, where computer vision algorithms extract positional data for all players on the court and the ball. \nStatistics.\nThe NBA provides a variety of statistics to the public based on the data produced by player tracking to the public on its website. This includes information for players covering categories such as drives, defensive impact, catch and shoot, passing, touches, pull up shooting, rebounding, shooting efficiency, speed, and post ups among others. Similar information is available for teams. \nIn addition, more sophisticated and detailed tools are available to teams and broadcasters that are not currently available to the public. \nPlayer tracking systems introduce many new statistics, automate the collection of data and provide precision which would be impossible without the use of camera technology and tracking software.\nStatistics collected, and available to view during the game and throughout the season include (all statistics are per player):"

Dmitry Vasilyev gave the Soviets a lead of more than a minute after the first leg.

However, Frank Ullrich, winner of 9 world championship gold medals, and three medals at the last Olympics, struggled with his skiing, only having the 10th fastest leg, and leaving his team fourth. For the Soviets, it was another story, Sergei Bulygin shooting clear and skiing a quick leg to win his side gold. They held off a hard charge from the Norwegians, as Kjell Søbak followed his teammate Kvalfoss in putting up the fastest leg to earn silver. Individual champion Peter Angerer had put the West Germans third going into the final leg, and while Fritz Fischer did not make up ground on the Soviets, they did move into bronze position by passing their East German opponents."

        "text": "The Men's 4 x 7.5 kilometre biathlon relay competition at the 1980 Winter Olympics took place on 22 February, at Lake Placid Olympic Sports Complex Cross Country Biathlon Center. Each national team consisted of four members, with each skiing 7.5 kilometres and shooting twice, once prone and once standing.\nAt each shooting station, a competitor has eight shots to hit five targets; however, only five bullets are loaded in a magazine at one time - if additional shots are required, the spare bullets must be loaded one at a time. If after the eight shots are taken, there are still targets not yet hit, the competitor must ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nResults.\nThe East Germans were the two-time defending world champions, while the defending Olympic champions from the Soviet Union had just one bronze medal to show from those two championships. Vladimir Alikin set the tone for the Soviets in the first leg, putting together the single fastest lap of the relay race, and giving his side a twenty second lead over the East Germans. The lead then expanded when Klaus Siebert struggled, needing a penalty loop on each of his two shooting rounds. At the halfway point, the Soviets were more than a minute ahead, and while the Germans cut down the lead over the last two legs, they were not able to get close. West Germany struggled early, Franz Bernreiter taking two penalty loops on the first leg, but strong legs from Hans Estner and Peter Angerer got them up to third, and with Norway's Odd Lirhus taking two penalties on the third leg, the West Germans were able to take the bronze."

It was hosted by the New York Cosmos of the original North American Soccer League.\nHistory.\nThe Cosmos won the inaugural Trans-Atlantic Challenge Cup defeating the Vancouver Whitecaps 5 points to 4.\nThe second Trans-Atlantic Challenge Cup was held in May. Representing the US were the Cosmos, 1980 league champions and Seattle, #2 point getters against Glasgow Celtic and Southampton. Once again, the US teams came out on top, with Seattle defeating Southampton 3–1, and Glasgow Celtic 2–1. The Cosmos shutout Glasgow 2–0 before finishing Southampton 2–1. Glasgow Celtic took the consolation game, and Seattle and New York battled to a championship draw before 40,000 spectators at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. Seattle won the tournament, having outscored the Cosmos 8–7. Attendance averaged nearly 30,000 for the tournament, which provided the local soccer fans a good dose of high quality international soccer.\nThe Trans-Atlantic Challenge Cup returned for its third season. The Chicago Sting, 1981 Soccer Bowl champions, and the New York Cosmos, 1981 regular season leader and 1980 and 1981 TACC titlist, represented the NASL. Napoli of Italy Serie 'A', and Nacional of Uruguay, the 1981 World Club champion finished the pool. The series was launched May 26, 1982 before 28,887 at Giants Stadium, as Napoli and the Cosmos battled to a 2–2 draw. The next day, Nacional and the Sting drew 0–0. On May 29, the Cosmos defeated Nacional and Chicago defeated Napoli by identical 3–1 scores, leading to the championship doubleheader, where Napoli defeated Nacional 3–0 and the Chicago Sting defeated New York 4–3 to take their first title. Unlike the first two years, even this popular event failed to draw large crowds this season.\nThe Trans-Atlantic Challenge Cup's fourth season again featured the New York Cosmos and Seattle Sounders, along with Fiorentina of Italy and São Paulo of Brazil. New York and Seattle took the first games, but São Paulo and Fiorentina took the second. In the doubleheader on June 5, Fiorentina defeated São Paulo 5–3 and New York defeated Seattle 4–1, giving the Cosmos the title over Fiorentina based on goal differential. Once again, the New York fans came in droves, with 51,000 for the final, but Seattle fans stayed away, averaging only about 6,000 at the Kingdome.\nThe final tournament in 1984 featured the Cosmos as the only North American club. They won the tournament for the third and final time by defeating Udinese in front of a crowd of 34,158 at Giants Stadium 4–1."

        "title": "Dick Wilson (golf course architect)",
        "text": "Louis Sibbett \"Dick\" Wilson (1904 – July 5, 1965) was an American golf course architect, who designed over sixty courses. Several of these still have a high reputation. He was known for his technique of elevating the greens when designing courses in relatively flat terrain, and for using ponds and bunkers to emphasize the aerial approach.\nEarly years.\nWilson was born in 1904 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father was a contractor. He worked as a water boy on construction of the Merion Golf Course in Philadelphia. Wilson was admitted to the University of Vermont on a football scholarship.\nAfter leaving university he joined the team of Howard C. Toomey and William S. Flynn of Philadelphia.\nIn 1931 he supervised construction when Toomey and Flynn undertook a complete overhaul of the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club.\nWith Toomey and Flynn he also worked on the course for the Cleveland Country Club, two golf courses at the Boca Raton Resort in Boca Raton, Florida, the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, and Springdale, outside Princeton, among others. During the Great Depression, Wilson got a job managing Delray Beach Golf Club. He was a course superintendent for a time, then during World War II (1939–1945) he worked on airfield camouflage.\nCourse architect.\nAfter the war Wilson became a golf course designer in his own right. Business was slow at first, but by 1952 it had picked up sufficiently for Wilson to take on an associate, Joe Lee, a 30-year-old graduate of the University of Miami. Wilson's style included broad fairways and large greens. He gave his bunkers a curvelinear form. In the flat country of Florida he developed a style in which putting surfaces were slightly raised, making them more visible and also helping with drainage. The axis of the green would be set at a 30% – 45% diagonal to the fairway, with a large bunker guarding the approach.\nWilson's courses typically included various artificial lakes, largely to provide fill for the elevated tees and greens, but also for the sake of adding challenge. His designs reflected the emerging concept that the putting surfaces should be reached by aerial approaches. \nThe West Palm Beach Golf Course (1947) is an early example of Wilson's work, a championship course with rolling terrain and elevated greens. In 1954 the Deepdale Golf Club bought the W.R. Grace estate on Long Island and had a new course designed by Wilson. By 1959, when he designed the course for the Cypress Lake Country Club, he was at the peak of his career. He was known for his renovation of the Seminole Golf Club course in Juno Beach, Florida, updating Donald Ross's scratchy bunkers and giving them a more modern curvelinear form, as well as for his course design for the Hole In The Wall Golf Club in Naples, Florida.\nIn 1960 Wilson did some work for the Metropolitan Golf Club in Melbourne, Australia. In 1960 land had been taken from the club's course for school development. Using adjoining land, Wilson designed a set of replacement holes that have now completely blended in with the original. Wilson and Joe Lee designed the 18-hole course for the private Lagunita Country Club in El Hatillo Municipality, Venezuela, a relatively prosperous part of Caracas. The course, part of a real estate development, opened in 1964.\nWilson died in 1965 at the age of 61. Arnold Palmer purchased Bay Hill in 1976. The PGA of America moved PGA National Golf Club to a new location in 1981. Donald Trump purchased Doral in 2012.\nNotable courses.\nWilson designed or renovated at least sixty courses during his career, several of which are still highly regarded.\nSome of Wilson's best courses, many of the later ones built in partnership with Joe Lee, included:\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"

        "text": "Ryan Thomas Fitzgerald (born October 19, 1994) is an American professional ice hockey forward who is currently playing with the Utica Comets in the American Hockey League (AHL). He was selected by the Boston Bruins with the last pick in the 4th round (120th overall) of the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nFitzgerald was born in Boca Raton, Florida, when his father Tom was a member of the Florida Panthers. As a result of his father's career, he grew up in Florida and Tennessee, before his family settled in North Reading, Massachusetts.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nFitzgerald played for Malden Catholic High School of MIAA Catholic Conference and the Valley Jr. Warriors of the Eastern Junior Hockey League before committing to play for Boston College Eagles in the Hockey East conference of the NCAA. He was the 2012 MVP of the CCM/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game.\nCollegiate.\nFitzgerald joined the Eagles in the 2013-14 season and made an impact immediately as a rookie, being named the conference's rookie of the month for November, in just his second month of collegiate play. Playing alongside Hobey Baker winner Johnny Gaudreau, Fitzgerald finished the season fifth on the team in scoring with 29 points as the Eagles made a deep NCAA tournament run, coming up just short of the title game after falling to eventual champions Union in the Frozen Four.\nFitzgerald's sophomore campaign was consistent, as he led the team in goals scored (17) and finished fourth on the team scoring (25), despite an early exit from postseason play.\nFitzgerald's junior year was a breakout year as he led the team in both goals scored (24) and overall scoring (47), helping the team to another deep NCAA tournament run. However, the Eagles would fall short of the championship yet again, after being defeated by the Quinnipiac Bobcats in the Frozen Four. For his efforts during the season, Fitzgerald was named a Hockey East 1st-Team All-Star as well as an NCAA 2nd-Team All-American.\nFor his senior year, Fitzgerald was named an assistant captain of the Eagles, but dipped in his point production as the Eagles had an off year in terms of postseason success. Fitzgerald scored 12 goals and 31 points on the year as the Eagles reached the Hockey East tournament Championship, but fell to the UMass Lowell River Hawks and failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament. Fitzgerald ended his NCAA career with 66 goals and 132 points.\nProfessional.\nWith the completion of his collegiate career, Fitzgerald was signed to a two-year entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins on March 24, 2017. He immediately joined AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, on an amateur try-out basis to play out the remaining 2016–17 season.\nAfter parts of four seasons within the Bruins organization, playing exclusively with AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, Fitzgerald left as a free agent. Unable to garner NHL interest, Fitzgerald agreed to a one-year AHL contract with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, affiliate to the Philadelphia Flyers, for the 2020–21 season on January 18, 2021. In the shortened AHL season with the Phantoms, Fitzgerald increased his scoring output, registering 12 goals and 21 points through only 27 regular season games.\nAs a free agent, Fitzgerald opted to continue within the Flyers organization, securing a one-year, two-way NHL contract with Philadelphia on July 28, 2021.\nOn August 16, 2022, Fitzgerald continued his tenure with the Phantoms, signing a one-year AHL contract as a free agent.\nOn July 7, 2023, Fitzgerald signed with the Utica Comets.\nPersonal life.\nFitzgerald's father is Tom Fitzgerald, a former player in the NHL and the current general manager of the New Jersey Devils. His younger brother, Casey, is a defenseman for the Florida Panthers and played with Ryan when they both attended Boston College. He is also cousins with former Eagles and NHL player Kevin Hayes, along with his late brother Jimmy Hayes as well as NHL players Brady, Matthew and Keith Tkachuk."

        "title": "Continental Volleyball Conference",
        "text": "The Continental Volleyball Conference is an intercollegiate men's volleyball conference associated with the NCAA's Division III.\nHistory.\nOn April 4, 2011, Gary Williams, Associate Athletic Director of Carthage College announced in Milwaukee the formation of the Continental Volleyball Conference. The league was established as a direct result of the launch of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in the next school year of 2011–12 where the inaugural tournament was held in April 2012.\nWith the continued growth of Division III men's volleyball, the CVC announced in March 2014 that it would split into two leagues after the 2014 season. The league's six Eastern members retained the CVC name and branding, while the six Midwestern members, plus two other Midwestern schools that had been announced as incoming CVC members, formed a new men's volleyball conference that was later unveiled as the Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League (MCVL). When the split was announced, the eastern members also added Rutgers–Newark, a Division III school which had previously played at the National Collegiate (Division I/II) level as a \"grandfathered\" scholarship-granting program, for the 2015 season.\nThe conference added the newly launched men's volleyball program of Alvernia as its eighth member for the 2017 season.\nFurther membership changes were announced in 2016. First, on October 12, the Middle Atlantic Conferences, whose Commonwealth Conference was the all-sports home of charter CVC member Stevenson and new CVC member Alvernia, announced that its Middle Atlantic Conference would begin sponsoring men's volleyball in the 2018 season, leading to the departure of those schools from the CVC. Within a week of this development, the CVC announced that Kean, Neumann, and Southern Virginia would \nbecome new members for the 2018 season, and that Thiel would leave after that same season. Then, on November 21, Ramapo was announced as an incoming member for the 2018 season.\nThiel did not initially announce its future men's volleyball affiliation, but would eventually be revealed as a new affiliate member of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference effective with the 2018–19 school year.\nWhile Thiel left after the 2018 season, the CVC added three new members for the 2019 season, all of which launched new varsity programs at that time. First, in October 2017, Randolph–Macon College was announced as an incoming member. Then, in December of that year, the CVC announced that Elizabethtown College and Immaculata University would also join.\nOn July 1, 2018, the New Jersey Athletic Conference announced they would add men's volleyball as a sponsored sport. Kean and Rutgers–Newark maintain dual membership in the CVC and NJAC starting in 2018–19. Ramapo College left the CVC and returned to the Skyline Conference; Rampo maintains dual affiliation for men's volleyball in the NJAC and Skyline.\nInaugural member, Cairn departed the conference for the 2019–20 academic year after the university's all-sport conference, the Colonial States Athletic Conference, announced the addition of men's volleyball as a conference sport.\nMember schools.\nCurrent members.\nThe league currently has 9 full members.\nNote that because NCAA men's volleyball is a spring sport, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of competition.\nFormer members.\nSchool names and nicknames reflect those in use during the final season each school was a CVC member.\nIn addition to the above schools, two other institutions that were adding men's volleyball for the 2014–15 school year (2015 season)—Benedictine University in Illinois and Loras College in Iowa—had been announced as new CVC members. They never officially joined the CVC, instead uniting with the six Midwestern CVC schools in the MCVL. (Benedictine left once its all-sports home of the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference began sponsoring men's volleyball in 2017–18, while Loras left the MCVL in 2019 for single-sport membership in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin, which added men's volleyball for 2019–20 and beyond.)\nMembership timeline.\nAs noted previously, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of competition."

He left the club to go to Sheffield on loan after 8 appearances. In August 2009 Barlow left to join Halifax.\nIn September 2010, Sheffield Eagles threatened legal action against Barlow and Halifax due to a breach of contract. Barlow had been released by Sheffield Eagles on the condition that he did not play against the club during the rest of the season, but this agreement was broken when Barlow played (and scored a try) in Halifax's 42–16 victory over Sheffield Eagles in the Championship play-off semi finals. The clubs later agreed an out-of-court settlement.\nBarlow is a Scotland international, having made his début in 2010. He was named in their squad for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup.\nHe is the brother of the rugby league footballer; Josh Barlow.\nOn 7 September 2016, Barlow was banned from all sport for four years for assaulting a UK Anti-Doping Agency official in June 2015.

        "text": "The 1989–90 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team represented University of Kentucky in the 1989–90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The head coach was Rick Pitino and the team finished the season with an overall record of 14–14. Coming off the controversy of the Eddie Sutton scandal, the NCAA banned the Kentucky Wildcats from television for one season. The NCAA sanctions placed on the program would also ban any postseason competition for two years and a three-year probational period. Pitino knew this and still took the challenge of making this team successful despite the many deficient parts of the program.\nComing off a decent season in the NBA with the Knicks, Pitino missed the college experience and felt that Kentucky would be the most interesting choice. Pitino was reportedly offered six million dollars for a seven-year contract with Kentucky. Coming into the new season, not all of Kentucky's players were completely committed to playing due to the program being in shambles. Some players were reported to have skipped class or not put forth 100% effort into practices. Ironically, the students that did not compete were focusing more on their grades so they could graduate. Despite Rick Pitino's intense coaching effort, the season included many difficult moments for the Wildcats, including a 150–95 loss to Kansas (which is the largest margin of defeat in Kentucky history). Despite all these obstacles, the Wildcats finished with a respectable .500 record, and Pitino was named SEC Coach of the Year (for the first of three times) for guiding Kentucky to a 10–8 record in conference and was named the Basketball Times National Coach of the Year in 1990.\nPersonnel.\nIn the wake of the previous season's alleged scandal, Pitino brought in new assistant coaches. One of which was a close friend of his, Ralph Willard. He would leave the New York Knicks to follow Pitino to Kentucky. Tubby Smith left his position as assistant coach at the University of South Carolina to pursue his new career at the University of Kentucky. Herb Sendek was also brought in as an assistant coach. Sendek had previously served as a graduate assistant to Pitino at Providence College. Pitino brought in Billy Donovan as the graduate assistant coach. This would be after a short career on Wall Street and a stint playing in the Continental Basketball Association."

European teams have won every time except 1995 where South Korea won as the first team outside Europe and 2013 where Brazil won as the first American team. The biggest winners are Russia and Norway with four titles each.\nNine teams participated in the first championship, this number has grown in steps to 32 (from 2021). In 1977 a B-tournament was introduced and later in 1986 a C-tournament which served as qualification for the real championship or A-tournament. The B- and C-tournament qualifications were replaced by the present qualification system based on continental confederations in 1993.\nFrom 1993 it has been held every other year. Between 1978 and 1990 it was held every fourth alternating with the Olympic tournament (introduced for women handball in 1976). The first five tournaments were held in the summer or early fall whereas the rest has been held in November or December.\nMedal table.\nIHF only includes medals won at the indoor championships.\nParticipation nations.\nSource: IHF official site.\nSince first entering the tournament in 1957, Romania are the only team to have appeared in all 26 tournaments to date.\nMost successful players.\nBoldface denotes active handball players and highest medal count among all players (including these who not included in these tables) per type.\nMultiple gold medalists.\nThe table shows players who have won at least 3 gold medals at the World Championships.\nMultiple medalists.\nThe table shows players who have won at least 4 medals in total at the World Championships.\nTop scorers and best players by tournament.\nThe record-holder for scored goals in a single World Championship is Bojana Radulović.

        "text": "Bosnia and Herzegovina appeared for the first time in a FIFA World Cup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, and remains the only time the team participated at a major international tournament to date.\nAlthough Serbia is accepted by FIFA as the official successor of Yugoslavia, Bosnian players have played a role in World Cup history before their independence in 1992.\nYugoslavia qualified for the World Cup eight times between 1930 and 1990. While in the early editions Yugoslavia was mainly represented by Serbs, the squads grew more inclusive over time.\nA notable early appearance of a Bosnian player at a FIFA World Cup was in 1962, when striker Arman Spahić broke an opponent's leg in a brutal foul. Although he was not carded by the referee, he was sent home by his own federation and was never called up for an international match again.\nMore positively, several Bosnian players were part of the 1974 first team line-up that advanced from the group stage unbeaten and ahead of Brazil. Striker Dušan Bajević scored three goals in one of the highest World Cup victories of all time: Yugoslavia's 9–0 against Zaire. Defender Josip Katalinski also scored during that game. Other Bosnians from that years team include goalkeeper Enver Marić and defender Enver Hadžiabdić.\nPlaymaker Safet Sušić, often considered to be the best Bosnian player of all time, represented Yugoslavia at the World Cup both in 1982 and 1990. The team that reached the quarter-finals in 1990 was captained by Zlatko Vujović, another player of Bosnian heritage.\nFIFA World Cup record.\nAfter Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence from Yugoslavia on 1 March 1992, the national football team was soon formed but could not enter qualifying for 1994 World Cup as the national association was not yet a member of FIFA. During qualifiers for 1998 World Cup, Bosnia's first home match against Croatia was played at Bologna. The match was held at the neutral venue due to the renovation of the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium.\nThe team finished in third place during 2006 World Cup qualifying, recording two draws with Spain along the way. During qualifiers for 2010 World Cup Bosnia reached its first ever playoffs for a major tournament, though eventually losing to Portugal 2–0 on aggregate.\nThe 2014 World Cup is the first time Bosnia has appeared at a major tournament as an independent nation, having qualified as winners of UEFA Group G.\nRecord players.\nSix players were fielded in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina's matches at the 2014 World Cup, making them record players for their country.\nTop goalscorers.\nFour players scored one goal each for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In addition, an own goal was scored by left-back Sead Kolašinac in their match against Argentina, which holds the record for fastest own goal at a FIFA World Cup at two minutes and six seconds."

Vanderbilt II in 1924, using part of his Deepdale summer estate at Lake Success.\nCharles B. Macdonald designed the course, assisted by Seth Raynor.\nThe Deepdale Golf Club was incorporated on 26 October 1924 as a private club with a strictly limited membership.\nNoted members in the past included the Duke of Windsor and President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nIn the 1950s suburbs began to be built in the region, and in 1954 the Long Island Expressway was built, cutting through the north end of the course.\nThe club bought the nearby Joseph Peter Grace, Sr. estate and had a new course designed by Dick Wilson.\nThe Grace mansion was used as the clubhouse.\n1955 Calcutta scandal.\nThe prestigious club was the location of the 1955 Deepdale Calcutta handicapping scandal.\nA Calcutta auction, named after the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, is a form of betting in which the competitors in tournament are auctioned off to bidders in a pool. The \"owners\" of the winning team split their portion of the pool with the players. Calcuttas were often rigged, with golfers faking their handicaps or accepting bribes to lose.\nIn 1955 two three-handicap golfers entered an amateur tournament at Deepdale. They gave their handicaps as 17 and 18, scored a net 58-57 and won by five strokes. \nThey and the syndicate that backed them each won $16,000 from a $45,000 pool. The scandal emerged after one of the players admitted what he had done in a letter to the President of the club, \nand the story reached the newspapers.\nAs a result of the scandal, the United States Golf Association formally outlawed Calcuttas.\nCourse today.\nThe course today is from its longest tees. Walking is allowed.\nIt has a par value of 70, a rating of 72.6 and a slope of 135.\nSome celebrity players have included Bob Hope, Tom Brokaw and Sean Connery.\nMore recent members include Sidney Poitier, Tiki Barber and Michael Bloomberg.\nAs of 2006 the course was rated 36 in the list of America's \"100 Most Prestigious Golf Clubs\" published by Golf Connoisseur magazine.\nIn March 2006 it was reported that the village of North Hills, an extremely wealthy community, was looking into using eminent domain laws to condemn the club and convert it to a semi-public course for use by local residents. Given the wealth of the village residents and the wealth of the club members, \"The New York Times\" described the contest as \"a battle of Goliath against Goliath.\"\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of December 2015 only 45 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Richie Benaud, a leg spinner and former captain of the Australia cricket team, played 63 Tests for his country between 1952 and 1964. He took 248 wickets at an average of 27.03, including 16 five-wicket hauls. The cricket almanack \"Wisden\" named him one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1962. He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2007, and into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame as one of the inaugural members in January 2009. Leo McKinstry, a cricket writer, in 1998 described Benaud as \"one of cricket's greatest legends\" and \"one of the great all-rounders\", and further noted him being the first to take 200 wickets and make 2,000 runs in Tests.\nBenaud made his Test debut in January 1952 against the West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, a match Australia won by 202 runs. His first Test five-wicket haul came in the first match of the 1956–57 series against India at the Corporation Stadium. He took 7 wickets for 72 runs in the first innings of the match, his best bowling figures for an innings. Benaud took his solitary pair of five-wicket hauls in the third Test of the series at the Eden Gardens. He accumulated 11 wickets for 105 runs in the match, his career-best performance in Test cricket. Benaud claimed his 16 five-wicket hauls against five different opponents, and Australia never lost any of the games on such instances. He was most successful against India and South Africa, taking 5 five-wicket hauls against each side. Benaud took his five-wicket hauls at 12 cricket grounds, including 11 at venues outside Australia. As of August 2014, he is thirty-first among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers."

        "text": "The figure 8 belay device is a piece of metal (usually an aluminum alloy) in the shape of an 8 with one large end and one small end.\nUsage.\nThis device utilizes a large surface area in contact with a climbing rope to provide sufficient friction along with the proper technique to be used as a belay device or for rappelling. A figure 8 (sometimes just referred to as an 8) is used in conjunction with a climbing harness and locking carabiner to control a belayed climber's descent, or one's own descent when rappelling.\nPros.\nFigure-eights offer a smooth controlled descent when rappelling and lowering climbers. They can be used with nearly any diameter climbing rope and don't get as hot as other friction devices because of their ability to dissipate heat efficiently. The figure eight can also be used with a doubled rope, which is also possible with a rack but not a bobbin.\nCons.\nThe figure-eight cannot be removed from the rope without detaching the device from the harness, and so could be accidentally dropped, particularly when tackling a rebelay. They also twist the rope which is a particular problem where a rebelay prevents the rope from untwisting. They do not provide a convenient means to temporarily lock the descent at a rebelay."

Beginning in 1994, ABC was the official American network broadcaster of the World Cup up through 2014. ABC also broadcast the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1999 and 2003; Fox took over the American World Cup TV broadcasts in 2011, which took effect in 2015.\n1970.\nThe first American telecast of a World Cup match was when NBC aired the final between England and West Germany from four years prior. NBC there, aired the contest on a same-day tape delay using the BBC’s black-and-white feed.\nIn 1970, it was ABC's turn to broadcast the World Cup final. While ABC aired the contest between Italy and Brazil in color unlike what NBC did in 1966, ABC decided to wait until Christmas, six months after Brazil won, to show it as part of an episode of \"Wide World of Sports\".\n1982.\nIn 1982, PBS and ESPN provided the first thorough American television coverage of the FIFA World Cup. ABC aired the first live telecast of the final. ABC aired commercials during the live action. Meanwhile, PBS aired same day highlights of the top game of the day.\n1994.\nThe 1994 FIFA World Cup marked the return of the World Cup on ESPN and ABC and the first time they used their own commentary teams for all matches. Roger Twibell and Seamus Malin were the lead broadcast team. Al Trautwig and Rick Davis were the secondary broadcast team. Other play-by-play announcers were: Bob Carpenter Bob Ley, Ian Darke, Randy Hahn, and Jim Donovan. Other color commentators were: Clive Charles, Ty Keough, Peter Vermes, Ron Newman, and Bill McDermott. Jim McKay was the studio host alongside studio analyst Desmond Armstrong only for games on ABC.\nThe 1994 American coverage had many firsts: The first with all of the matches televised, the first with no commercial interruptions during live action, and the first to feature an on-screen score &amp; time box.\n1998.\nIn 1998, all 64 matches were televised in the United States live for the first time. Bob Ley and Seamus Malin was the lead broadcast team with other broadcast teams include: Roger Twibell and Mike Hill, JP Dellacamera and Bill McDermott, Derek Rae and Ty Keough, and Phil Schoen and Tommy Smyth. Brent Musburger and Eric Wynalda worked in the studio.\n2002.\nUnlike in 1998, when ESPN and ABC paid $20 million for the broadcast rights to the World Cup, the English-language rights for the 2002 and 2006 editions were sold instead to Major League Soccer for $40-50 million. Through an agreement with the Walt Disney Company, ESPN and ABC would air both tournaments at no cost, while MLS would cover production costs and sell advertisements via its newly-created marketing arm, Soccer United Marketing.\nIn 2002, 59 matches were broadcast live, along with 5 rebroadcasts on ABC, with coverage from Japan and South Korea carried live in the American late night graveyard slot.\nHockey play-by-play announcer Jack Edwards and Ty Keough were the lead broadcast team and called the games live in South Korea and Japan. Other broadcast teams were: JP Dellacamera and Tommy Smyth, Glenn Davis and Shep Messing, and Mike Hill and Shep Messing, and Seamus Malin, however, they were based at the ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. Terry Gannon hosted in the studio alongside studio analysts Eric Wynalda and Giorgio Chinaglia.\n2006.\nThe 2006 coverage from Germany was fully live as well. Dave O'Brien joined Marcelo Balboa on the lead broadcast team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup coverage on ESPN and ABC Sports, despite having no experience calling soccer matches prior to that year. Because The Walt Disney Company, owner of both television outlets, retained control over on-air talent, the appointment of O'Brien as the main play-by-play voice was made over the objections of Soccer United Marketing, who wanted JP Dellacamera to continue in that role. Disney stated that their broadcast strategy was intended, in voice and style, to target the vast majority of Americans who do not follow the sport on a regular basis. Mispronunciation and incorrect addressing of names, misuse of soccer terminology, and lack of insight into tactics and history plagued the telecasts, resulting in heavy criticism from English-speaking soccer fans, many of whom ended up watching the games on Univision instead.\nOther broadcast teams included: JP Dellacamera and John Harkes, Glenn Davis and Shep Messing, Adrian Healey and Tommy Smyth, and Rob Stone and Robin Fraser. Brent Musburger returned for his 2nd World Cup as lead studio host with other hosts Rece Davis, and Dave Revsine. Alexi Lalas, Eric Wynalda, Julie Foudy, and Heather Mitts were the studio analysts.\n2010.\nThe 2010 coverage from South Africa introduced ESPN 3D for 25 matches. ESPN's coverage of the 2010 World Cup has been widely recognized as a breakthrough in U.S. soccer broadcasting. Esteemed commentator Martin Tyler and Efan Ekoku led a team of all-British commentators in South Africa. Chris Fowler and Mike Tirico were the lead hosts in a studio set right outside of Soccer City in South Africa. Other broadcast teams were: Ian Darke and John Harkes, who called USMNT games, Derek Rae and Robbie Mustoe, Adrian Healey and Ally McCoist, and Jim Proudfoot and Roberto Martínez. Studio analysts were: Steve McManaman, Jurgen Klinsmann, Martínez, Ruud Gullit, Alexi Lalas, Shaun Bartlett, and Tommy Smyth. Bob Ley was another studio host, working his 4th World Cup. Reporters were: Jeremy Schaap (United States and Final), Julie Foudy, Allen Hopkins, Rob Stone, Selema Masekela, Andrew Orsatti (Australia), John Sutcliffe (Mexico), and Dan Williams\n2014.\nThe 2014 World Cup marked the end of the FIFA World Cup on ABC and ESPN. Ian Darke, Steve McManaman, and Taylor Twellman was the lead broadcast team, Jon Champion and Stewart Robson were the #2 team. Other play-by-play announcers were: Derek Rae, Adrian Healey, Daniel Mann, and Fernando Palomo. Color commentators: Craig Burley, Efan Ekoku, Roberto Martínez, Kasey Keller, and Alejandro Moreno. All commentators were in Brazil with the top 5 teams at the stadiums while the remaining team called matches off monitors in Rio. Mike Tirico was the lead studio host alongside other hosts Bob Ley and Lynsey Hipgrave with analysts: Alexi Lalas, McManaman, Michael Ballack, Moreno, Keller, Gilberto Silva, Santiago Solari, Martínez, Twellman, and Ruud van Nistelrooy. Reporters included: Jeremy Schaap (Lead), Julie Foudy, Bob Woodruff, John Sutcliffe, Rubens Pozzi.\nThe 2014 coverage was available on mobile devices and tablets via the WatchESPN application, as well as on Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles, live and on-demand, via the ESPN on Xbox Live application.\nNBC.\nFIFA World Cup on NBC is the branding used for presentations of the FIFA World Cup produced by the NBC television network in the United States. NBC was the official American network television broadcaster for the international soccer competition in 1966 and 1986.\n1966.\nThe first American coverage of the World Cup consisted only of a previously filmed telecast of the 1966 Final on NBC. The Final was aired before their coverage of the Saturday \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\". NBC used the black &amp; white BBC feed and aired it on a two-hour film delay. This was the first time soccer had been shown in the United States as a stand-alone broadcast. Previously, ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" had shown England's Football Association Cup on as long as a two-week delay.\n1986.\nOn October 6, 1984. NBC's anthology series, \"SportsWorld\" provided World Cup soccer qualifying coverage featuring the United States and the Netherlands Antilles.\n1986 marked the first time that the World Cup had extensive live cable and network television coverage in the United States. ESPN carried most of the weekday matches while NBC did weekend games. NBC aired seven matches, including the \"Hand of God\" quarterfinal, with broadcasters on-site. NBC's theme music for their 1986 coverage was Herb Alpert's \"1980\", from his 1979 album \"Rise\". It was originally a cue meant for the ill-fated 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics broadcasts. Meanwhile, ESPN aired about 25 matches that year, all with broadcasters in studio.\nNBC's producers were forced to run the games' audio feed through telephone lines rather than through satellites. This was because the International Broadcast Center in Mexico City crossed up many communication lines. Consequently, various countries received commentary from others (or no sound or video at all). NBC in this case, received commentary from somewhere in Southeast Asia and so were forced to have Charlie Jones call collect and broadcast the Italy-Bulgaria opener via a handset telephone receiver. NBC lost the sound but still had video so Charlie Jones dialed collect again.\nTelemundo Deportes'.\nOn October 22, 2011, Deportes Telemundo acquired the Spanish language rights to broadcast the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cup for around $600 million, replacing Univision as the tournament's Spanish language broadcaster, which began carrying the World Cup tournaments in 1970 (Fox acquired the English language U.S. broadcast rights through a separate agreement). The deal, which began with the 2015 Women's World Cup and runs through 2026, includes rights to associated FIFA-sanctioned tournaments (including the Men's Under 20 and Under 17 World Cups, and the Men's Beach Soccer World Cup), which will be telecast on Telemundo and NBC Universo; the deal was extended on February 12, 2015, to include rights to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nOn May 16, 2015, during Telemundo's 2015–16 upfront presentation in New York City, it was announced that Deportes Telemundo would be replaced by a new division initially known as NBC Deportes; the new division was formed as a branch of the English-language NBC Sports division, and be responsible for sports content for Telemundo, NBC Universo and related digital platforms. While it retained all existing sports telecast rights and programs aired by both Telemundo and NBC Universo, the latter network also began to expand its sports coverage, primarily in preparation for the 2016 Summer Olympics and the start of the division's contract with FIFA—whose first events included the 2015 U-20 World Cup and Women's World Cup.\nFox Sports.\nThe English television rights to the FIFA World Cup have been held by Fox Sports since the 2018 edition and are set to run through 2026. The rights were originally set to expire in 2022, but that tournament's move to a November–December schedule prompted FIFA to award the 2026 rights to appease Fox, who had prior commitments to air other sporting events during the period. The 2022 World Cup broadcast was criticized for ignoring Qatar's human rights issues. Telemundo holds the Spanish television rights to broadcast the FIFA World Cup in the United States; their contract was also renewed through 2026."

The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nSaudi Arabia has qualified for a total of seven FIFA World Cup tournaments, having played in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2018, 2022, and 2034 as hosts. Their best performance was in 1994, where they reached the round of 16.\nTop goalscorers.\nSami Al-Jaber is not only the most successful Saudi striker at the FIFA World Cup to date, he also managed to score in World Cups twelve years apart (1994 and 2006). He shares this record with eight other players, among them Pelé, Diego Maradona, Miroslav Klose, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo."

        "text": "This is a record of France's results at the FIFA World Cup. France was one of the four European teams that participated at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and have appeared in 16 FIFA World Cups, tied for the sixth most of any country.\nThe national team is one of eight to have won the FIFA World Cup title and one of only six to have done so more than once.\nThe French team won its first World Cup title in 1998.\nThe tournament was played on home soil and France defeated Brazil 3–0 in the final match at the Stade de France. The tournament was hosted in France once before in 1938, where France was eliminated by defending champions Italy in the quarter-finals. In 2018, France won the World Cup for the second time, defeating Croatia 4–2 in the final at the Luzhniki Stadium in Russia.\nIn 2006 and 2022, France finished as runners-up, losing on penalties to Italy (5–3) and Argentina (4–2) after ties after 120 minutes. The team has also finished in third place on two occasions, in 1958 and 1986, and in fourth place once, in 1982.\nFrance at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\nBrazil vs France (Final).\nThe 1998 final was held on 12 July at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis. France defeated holders Brazil 3–0, with two goals from Zinedine Zidane and a stoppage time strike from Emmanuel Petit. The win gave France their first World Cup title, becoming the sixth national team after Uruguay, Italy, England, West Germany and Argentina to win the tournament on their home soil. They also inflicted the heaviest defeat on Brazil since 1930.\nThe pre-match build up was dominated by the omission of Brazilian striker Ronaldo from the starting lineup only to be reinstated 45 minutes before kick-off. He managed to create the first open chance for Brazil in the 22nd minute, dribbling past defender Thuram before sending a cross out on the left side that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez struggled to hold onto. France however took the lead in the 27th minute after Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos conceded a corner which Zidane scored with a header from the right.\nThree minutes before half-time, Zidane scored his second goal of the match, similarly another header from a corner, this time from the left side. The tournament hosts went down to ten men in the 68th minute as Marcel Desailly was sent off for a second bookable offence. Brazil reacted to this by making an attacking substitution and although they applied pressure France sealed the win with a third goal: substitute Patrick Vieira set up his club teammate Petit in a counterattack to shoot low past goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel.\nFrench president Jacques Chirac was in attendance to congratulate and commiserate the winners and runners-up respectively after the match. Several days after the victory, winning manager Aimé Jacquet announced his resignation from the French team with immediate effect.\n&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nFrance at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nFrance vs Australia (Group C).\n&lt;section end=c1 /&gt;\nFrance vs Peru (Group C).\n&lt;section end=c4 /&gt;\nDenmark vs France (Group C).\n&lt;section end=c5 /&gt;\nFrance vs Argentina (round of 16).\n&lt;section end=r16-1 /&gt;\nUruguay vs France (Quarter-final).\n&lt;section end=qf1 /&gt;\nFrance vs Belgium (Semi-final).\n&lt;section end=sf1 /&gt;\nFrance vs Croatia (Final).\nCroatia kicked off the final at 18:00 local time (15:00 UTC), with the ground temperature reported at . The match was played through a minor thunderstorm, which produced several visible lightning strikes. An audience of 78,011 spectators at the Luzhniki Stadium watched the match, including ten heads of state, among them Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron, and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. The starting line-ups for both teams were identical to those fielded in the semi-finals.\nCroatia had the majority of possession and chances early in the first half, with the ball staying mostly in France's half. An attack by French midfielder Antoine Griezmann was stopped by a challenge from Marcelo Brozović, which was called as a foul despite claims that Griezmann dived. Griezmann took the ensuing free kick, which was diverted by the head of Mario Mandžukić into the left corner of his own net to give France the lead in the 18th minute. It was the first own goal to be scored in a World Cup final and the 12th of the tournament, the most of any World Cup.\nTen minutes later, Croatia equalised with a left-footed strike by Ivan Perišić to the right corner of the net, assisted by Domagoj Vida after a free kick by Luka Modrić on the right. In the 34th minute, a penalty was awarded against Croatia after Perišić's handball in the box from a corner on the right was reviewed by the video assistant referee. Griezmann scored the penalty in the 38th minute with a low finish to the left, giving France a 2–1 lead at half-time; the first half's three goals were the most of any World Cup final since 1974. France led at half-time despite having only one shot on goal and with only 34% of possession.\nA Croatian counter-attack was stopped early in the second half after several pitch invaders were chased onto the field by security officers; Russian feminist rock band and protest group Pussy Riot claimed responsibility for the interruption. In the 59th minute, France extended their lead to 3–1 with a left-foot strike to the left of the net from the edge of the penalty area by Paul Pogba after his initial shot had been blocked. Six minutes later, Kylian Mbappé scored France's fourth goal, with a low right-foot shot from outside the box to the left of the net; Mbappé became the first teenager to score in a World Cup final since Pelé in 1958. Croatia scored their second goal in the 69th minute from a back-pass that goalkeeper Hugo Lloris failed to dribble away from Mandžukić, who poked the loose ball into the unguarded net with his right leg. Despite a late push by Croatia, the match finished as a 4–2 victory for France and the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966. This was the highest-scoring 90-minute World Cup final since 1958.\n&lt;section end=final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nFrance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup stage.\n \nMost matches played.\nGoalkeeper Hugo Lloris holds the FIFA World Cup record for most matches played by a goalkeeper.\nGoalkeeper Fabien Barthez also shares the FIFA World Cup record for most matches without conceding a goal, which he achieved ten times. The only other player to have reached that number is England's Peter Shilton.\nTop goalscorers.\nJust Fontaine scored all his 13 World Cup goals in 1958, where France reached third place. This makes him record holder for most goals scored in a single FIFA World Cup. At the time, it also made him the most successful World Cup scorer of all time until the record was broken by West Germany's Gerd Müller in the World Cup final of 1974."

        "title": "2026 FIFA World Cup bids",
        "text": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup bidding process resulted in the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selecting the joint United States / Canada / Mexico bid as the location for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nTwo bids to host the event were submitted to FIFA, a joint bid by Canada, Mexico and the United States, and one by Morocco. On 13 June 2018, at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, the joint bid was selected by 134 votes to Morocco's 65. This will be the first tournament hosted by more than two countries, and only the second hosted by more than one country—the other having been the 2002 tournament, hosted by South Korea and Japan.\nUpon this selection, each country made hosting records of their own. Canada becomes the fifth country to host both men's and women's World Cup—the latter having been in 2015; Mexico becomes the first country to host the men's World Cup three times—having done so previously in 1970 and 1986; and the United States becomes the first country to host both men's and women's World Cup twice—having hosted the 1994 men's and the 1999 and 2003 women's World Cups.\nBackground.\nThe FIFA Council (and its proceeding Executive Committee) went back and forth between 2013 and 2017 on limitations within hosting rotation based on the continental confederations. Originally, it was set that bids to be host would not be allowed from countries belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments. It was temporarily changed to only prohibit countries belonging to the confederation that hosted the previous World Cup from bidding to host the following tournament, before the rule was changed back to its prior state of two World Cups. However, the FIFA Council did make an exception to potentially grant eligibility to member associations of the confederation of the second-to-last host of the FIFA World Cup in the event that none of the received bids fulfill the strict technical and financial requirements. In March 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that \"Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively.\" Therefore, the 2026 World Cup could be hosted by one of the remaining four confederations: CONCACAF (last hosted in 1994), CAF (last hosted in 2010), CONMEBOL (last hosted in 2014), or OFC (never hosted before), or potentially by UEFA in case no bid from those four met the requirements.\nCo-hosting the FIFA World Cup, which had been banned by FIFA after the 2002 World Cup, was approved for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, though not limited to a specific number but instead evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Also by 2026, the FIFA general secretariat, after consultation with the Competitions Committee, will have the power to exclude bidders who do not meet the minimum technical requirements to host the competition.\nBid process.\nThe bidding process was due to start in 2015, with the appointment of hosts scheduled for the FIFA Congress on 10 May 2017 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but was postponed due to the 2015 FIFA corruption case and the subsequent resignation of Sepp Blatter and resumed following the FIFA Council meeting on 10 May 2016, with a final decision in May 2020, amid corruption allegations around the previous tournaments, due to be held in 2018 (Russia), as well as in 2022 (Qatar).\nThe original bidding process originally consisted of four phases:\nThe consultation phase focused on four areas:\nOn 7 November 2017, FIFA published a guide to bidding process. It outlines the key elements of the reformed bidding process, the assessment mechanisms in place, recommendations on the protection of the process' integrity, the timeline for the selection of the host(s), the specific requirements for hosting, a detailed explanation of the government guarantees, as well as the principles of sustainable event management and human rights protection.\nBid Evaluation Task Force.\nOn 27 October 2017, the FIFA Council ratified the decision of the Bureau of the Council of 6 September 2017 to approve the enhanced Bidding Regulations for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It also appointed the members of the Bid Evaluation Task Force. According to the Bidding Regulations, the Task Force is expected to be composed by:\nFast track bid process.\nWith no rival bid having emerged since April 2017 the CONCACAF member federations of Canada, Mexico and the United States sent a joint request to FIFA to hasten the bid process. Canada, Mexico and the United States wanted FIFA to award the bid outside the traditional bidding process at the June 2018 FIFA Congress in Moscow if the CONCACAF-bid meets FIFA requirements.\nHowever the FIFA Council proposed on 8 May 2017 that FIFA shall establish a bidding procedure inviting initially only the member associations of CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL and the OFC – continental confederations whose members have not hosted the two previous World Cups – as candidates to submit to FIFA bids to host the final competition of the 2026 FIFA World Cup by 11 August 2017. The 68th FIFA Congress will decide on the selection of the candidate host associations.\nOn 11 May 2017, the 67th FIFA Congress voted on the FIFA Council proposal to the fast-track the 2026 FIFA World Cup bid process and set the following deadlines:\nUpdated bidding process:\nDeadlines:\nBid requirements.\nEndorsement of a set of principles submitted by the FIFA administration as part of the process to select the host of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including an overview of the content to be requested from bidding member associations and high-level hosting requirements. These include: stadium and infrastructure requirements; principles of sustainable event management, human rights and environmental protection; and details on aspects such as governmental support documents, the organisational model to be adopted and provisions for the establishment of a legacy fund. A complete version of the bid requirements will eventually be dispatched to member associations that register to take part in the process.\nStadiums requirements.\nFIFA have established minimum requirements for stadiums capacities.\nTeam and referee facilities.\nFIFA established minimum requirements for team and referee facilities.\nOfficial bids.\nUnder FIFA rules as of 2017, the 2026 Cup cannot be in either Europe (UEFA) or Asia (AFC), leaving an African (CAF) bid, a North American (CONCACAF) bid, a South American (CONMEBOL) bid, or an Oceania (OFC) bid as the only possible options. In March 2017, FIFA confirmed that \"Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively.\"\nCAF.\nMoroccan Minister of Youth and Sports, Moncef Belkhayat, stated that: \"The African Cup of Nations 2015 will be the first indicator of our ability to host a great event. Then we can confidently consider us as a candidate to host the World Cup 2026\". However, in November 2014, Morocco asked to postpone the African Cup of Nations to summer due to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, and lost its hosting rights in favor of Equatorial Guinea.\nMorocco lost bids to host the World Cup in 1994, 1998, 2006, and 2010 to the United States, France, Germany, and South Africa, respectively. \nMorocco successfully hosted the 2013 and 2014 FIFA Club World Cups and the 2018 African Nations Championship.\nOn 11 August 2017, Morocco officially announced a bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nIf successful, it would have been the second African country, after the 2010 tournament in South Africa. \nCONCACAF.\nFollowing rumors on each nation bidding individually, the three nations announced on 10 April 2017 a bid to host the World Cup jointly. Canada and Mexico would host 10 games each, while the United States would host the remaining 60 games, including all remaining matches from the quarterfinals onward.\nThe 2026 tournament will be the first to be held in three countries. Mexico is the first nation to serve three World Cups, having already hosted the 1970 and 1986 men's tournaments. It will be the first men's tournament and second overall to be held in Canada after the 2015 women's tournament, and the second men's and fourth overall in the United States, after the 1994 men's and the 1999 and 2003 women's tournaments.\nBid evaluation report.\nSome of the main requirements addressed by FIFA are security, finance and hospitality, and Morocco fulfills all these requirements as this has been proven by the outcome of the FIFA Task Force: The note was 2,7 from the total of 5 points. Additionally the travel time between the proposed venues is manageable, since all the venues are within a one-hour flight of Casablanca. Another point is the suitable global time, because in Morocco the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the local time and therefore a large number of countries can watch the live transmission of the games in a suitable time. Finally the proximity to Europe is a good advantage for a large number of European supporters.\nHowever, multiple risks exist for FIFA with the bid. In its evaluation report, Morocco received high risk options for stadiums, accommodation and transportation. Overall the bid was labelled as high risk and the United joint bid was rated as low risk to FIFA.\n2026 World Cup host election results.\n203 of the 211 member associations of FIFA were able to vote. \nThe eight ineligible associations were as follows: \nThe United bid won receiving 134 votes, while the Morocco bid received 65 votes. No representative within their home confederation CONCACAF voted against the United bid, whilst eleven representatives within their home confederation CAF voted against the Morocco bid. The Brazil representative voted for the Morocco bid reportedly thinking the vote was private, despite its home confederation CONMEBOL having endorsed the United bid overall. Iran voted for the option \"None of the bids\", while Cuba, Slovenia and Spain abstained from voting.\nBroadcasting rights.\nOn 12 February 2015, Fox, Telemundo, and Bell Media's rights to the tournament were renewed by FIFA to cover 2026, without accepting any other bids. \"The New York Times\" believed that this extension was intended as compensation for the rescheduling of the 2022 World Cup to November–December rather than its traditional June–July scheduling, which falls during the heart of the National Football League season (where Fox is currently a main U.S. rightsholder), and the beginning of the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League seasons."

        "text": "The 2030 FIFA World Cup bidding process resulted in the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selecting the joint bid as the location for the 2030 FIFA World Cup: Spain, Portugal, and Morocco as the host nations. Additionally, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay will serve as nations that open the event, as a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the first World Cup.\nHost selection.\nFIFA launched the bidding process in earnest in 2022. As hosts of the 2022 and 2026 editions respectively, the 2030 FIFA World Cup could not be hosted by a member of the Asian AFC or the North American CONCACAF.\nHosts are required to have at least fourteen all-seater stadiums with a capacity of 40,000, with a minimum of seven being pre-existing. The opening match and final must take place in an 80,000-seat stadium, while the semi-finals must take place in a 60,000-seat stadium. Hosts must also have at least 72 suitable training site options for team base camps, four suitable venue-specific training site options per stadium, in addition to two suitable referee base camp training site options, all with suitable accommodation. The FIFA Council also regulates requirements relating to broadcasting sites, competition-related event sites, as well as accommodation. In addition, FIFA has stated that sustainability, environmental protections and human rights are also factors considered by the council, along with governmental support, the organisational model to be used, besides provisions for the establishment of a \"legacy fund\".\nBids.\nSpain–Portugal–Morocco.\nAfter two years of discussions between the Royal Spanish Football Federation and the Portuguese Football Federation, the two federations announced in October 2020 their plans to submit a joint bid. The agreement was ratified by the presidents of both federations the following June, and gained support from the heads of state and government of both countries. The Ukrainian Association of Football joined in October 2022 as a potential host for group stage matches during the tournament, despite the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Backed by the CAF, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, who independently announced their intention to bid, also joined Spain and Portugal's bid in March 2023.\nSpain hosted the 1982 World Cup, Euro 1964, and co-hosted Euro 2020, Portugal hosted Euro 2004, Ukraine co-hosted Euro 2012, while Morocco has hosted AFCON 1988 and WAFCON 2022. Fifteen potential venues across thirteen cities in peninsular Spain and the Canary Islands were shortlisted with the intention of downselecting to eleven venues for the tournament; the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid could host the tournament's opening match and final. Six venues in Morocco were selected for the bid, including five existing venues and a new 93,000-seat stadium. Fouzi Lekjaa, president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation stated his intention for the final to be played in Casablanca. He added that the three federations of Morocco, Spain and Portugal would convene on 18 October to discuss the scheduling of World Cup matches. After the meeting, the three federations agreed to present their letter of intent to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup on 28 October, following the formal procedure of the bidding process. Lekjaa stated that the three countries would also host the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029, which would confirm their readiness one year before the main event.\nUruguay–Argentina–Chile–Paraguay.\nThe Argentine and Uruguayan Football Association announced in July 2017 their joint bid, following years of planning, celebrating the centennial of the first World Cup hosted by Uruguay in 1930, and the bicentennial of the country's first constitution. National team players Luis Suárez of Uruguay and Lionel Messi of Argentina presented commemorative shirts promoting the bid at a highly publicised press conference that September. The Paraguayan Football Federation subsequently joined the bid that October, while the Football Federation of Chile joined in February 2019. Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay have all hosted the Copa América. Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay have hosted the FIFA World Cup, while Argentina and Chile have hosted Copa América Femenina. Eighteen stadiums across thirteen host cities are being considered as venues for the tournament: sixteen existing venues and a new stadium in Luque, Paraguay, where the headquarters of CONMEBOL are located.\nAbandoned bids.\nEgypt–Greece–Saudi Arabia.\nCurrently, an AFC member cannot host the 2030 edition, as Qatar hosted the 2022 edition. However, FIFA President Gianni Infantino alluded to potential rule changes allowing Asian countries to bid. Saudi Arabia planned a cross-confederation bid with UEFA member Greece and CAF member Egypt, after considering a bid with Italy or Morocco. Greece originally bid with Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia for Euro 2028 and the 2030 World Cup. Despite the approval of the countries' governments, culminating in the bid's announcement in February 2019, and a memorandum of understanding being signed in April, the bid was abandoned in 2022 when Greece joined Saudi Arabia instead. Saudi Arabia sought to further develop its diplomatic and military relations with Greece, and offered to fund the construction of new stadiums in Greece for the tournament. The proposal attracted controversy for accusations of sportswashing Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, and the country's unfavourable summer climate. Egypt's sports minister Ashraf Sobhy and Egyptian Football Association President Hany Abo Rida both expressed interest in hosting, but in April 2023, Sobhy revealed that Egypt was not planning a bid. By June, planning for the bid ceased.\nOn 1 September 2023 media reported Saudi Arabia to switch its FIFA World Cup focus from a 2030 joint bid to a 2034 sole bid.\nUnited Kingdom–Ireland.\nAs early as 2015, the English Football Association (FA) expressed interest in bidding. UEFA endorsed a possible English or pan-British bid, as President Aleksander Čeferin saw a British bid as the \"wisest\" option to consolidate efforts to realise a European-hosted World Cup into. The FA ultimately embarked on pan-British bid in 2018, joining with the football associations of Scotland, who sought an opportunity to redevelop Hampden Park, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's football association also joined in late 2018. The proposal enjoyed broad political support from the British Parliament, who later reserved £2.8 million for a potential bid, and the governments of the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nHowever, in January 2022, the five football associations announced that they would instead bid to host Euro 2028, leading to the abandonment of the World Cup bid shortly after.\nOther bids.\nCameroonian politician Joshua Osih made a potential joint bid with neighbouring central African nations part of his failed 2018 presidential election campaign, which attracted interest from Angola, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria. South Korean President Moon Jae-in expressed hope that a World Cup jointly hosted by North and South Korea would help improve relations in the region; the Korea Football Association would later extend a co-hosting offer to China and Japan, with Moon's approval. In addition, the Presidents of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru publicly announced their intentions to submit a joint bid, Football Australia explored a bid with Sydney 2000 bid chief Rod McGeoch, and the UNAF endorsed any potential joint North African bid. None of these efforts resulted in bids."

        "title": "Brazil at the 1970 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "At the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Brazil participated for the 9th time in the event. The country remained as the only national team to have participated in every installment of the FIFA World Cup. The 1970 Brazil line-up is often considered to be the greatest football team in history.\nThe Brazilian front five of Jairzinho, Pelé, Gérson, Tostão and Rivellino were all Number 10s in their own right and together they created an irresistible attacking momentum, with Pelé having central role in Brazil's way to the final, playing a part in 14 of Brazil's 19 goals in the tournament. In the first match, against Czechoslovakia, Pelé gave Brazil a 2–1 lead, by controlling Gerson's long pass with his chest and then scoring. In this match Pelé audaciously attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Viktor from the half-way line, only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak goal. Brazil went on to win the match, 4–1. In the first half of the match against England, Pelé nearly scored with a header that was spectacularly saved by Gordon Banks. In the second half, he assisted Jairzinho for the only goal of the match. Against Romania, Pelé opened the score on a direct free kick goal, a strong strike with the outside of his right foot. Later on in the match he scored again to take the score to 3–1. Brazil won by a final score of 3–2. In the quarterfinals against Peru, Brazil won 4–2, with Pelé assisting Tostão for Brazil's third goal. In the semi-finals, Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1, and Pelé assisted Rivellino for the 3–1. During that match, Pelé made one of his most famous plays. Tostão gave Pelé a through ball, and Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of it. The keeper ran off of his line to get the ball before Pelé, but Pelé got there first and fooled the keeper by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the keeper's left, while Pelé went right. Pelé went around the goalkeeper and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.\nBrazil played Italy in the final, with Pelé scoring the opener, with a header over Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Jairzinho's and Carlos Alberto's goals, the latter one coming after an impressive collective play. Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pelé was named player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pelé during the final, was quoted saying \"I told myself before the game, \"he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else\" — but I was wrong\".\nBrazil were given the Jules Rimet Trophy for keeps after winning in 1970. Housed in the Brazilian Football Association's Rio de Janeiro headquarters, the cup was stolen in 1983. It is thought the thieves melted it down for its more-than 3 kg of solid gold.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Mário Zagallo\nBrazil competed in Group 3 of the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Guadalajara's Estadio Jalisco between 2 and 11 June 1970. Brazil won the group, and advanced to the quarter-finals, along with World Cup holders England. Romania and Czechoslovakia failed to advance.\nEngland vs Brazil.\nBrazil were putting defending champions England under enormous pressure and an attack was begun by captain Carlos Alberto who sent a low ball down the right flank for the speedy Jairzinho to latch on to. The Brazilian winger sped past left-back Terry Cooper and crossed the ball into the six-yard box, where Pelé connected with a powerful header to send the ball low towards the right-hand corner of the goal. In the knowledge that his header was placed to perfection, Pelé immediately shouted \"Gol!\" (Portuguese for goal).\nThe split-second incident only allowed England goalkeeper Gordon Banks time for one conscious thought – that the shot was impossible to catch, and the only way to prevent Pelé from following up on the rebound would be to parry the ball over the bar. The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal-line, and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with the fingers of his right hand, and rolled his hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar. He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction. Banks then rose to his feet to defend the corner, and broke into laughter after the following exchange:\nThe only goal of the game was scored by Jairzinho in the 59th minute, a powerful right footed shot from about seven yards out on the right of the penalty area after receiving a pass from Pele.\nSemi-final Uruguay vs Brazil.\nLuis Cubilla opened the scoring for Uruguay in the 19th minute when he hit a right footed shot from the right of the six yard box that went past the goalkeeper and just inside the back post.\nClodoaldo equalised for Brazil just before half time when he received the ball on the left side of the penalty area from a cross from the right and shot right footed past to the right of the net. \nPelé made one of his most famous plays. Tostão then gave Pelé a through ball, and Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of it. The keeper ran off of his line to get the ball before Pelé, but Pelé got there first and fooled the keeper by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the keeper's left, while Pelé went right. Pelé went around the goalkeeper and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.\nJairzinho got the second goal for Brazil in the 76th minute, after receiving the ball he made a run past the defender and into the penalty box before shooting a low right footed shot into the net. The third goal for Brazil was scored by Rivellino in the 89th minute, a powerful low left footed shot from the edge of the penalty area into the right corner of the net.\nFinal.\nThe 1970 FIFA World Cup Final was contested by Brazil and Italy on 21 June 1970 in the Estadio Azteca in Mexico, to determine the winner of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This final marked the first time that two former world champions met in a final; Italy had previously won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938, while Brazil won in 1958 and 1962.\nBrazil struck first, with Pelé heading in a cross by Rivellino at the 18th minute. Roberto Boninsegna equalized for Italy after a blunder in the Brazilian defence. In the second half, Brazil's firepower and creativity was too much for an Italian side that clung to their cautious defensive system. Gérson fired in a powerful shot for the second goal, and then helped provide the third, with a long free kick to Pelé who headed down into the path of the onrushing Jairzinho. Pelé capped his superb performance by drawing the Italian defence in the centre and feeding captain Carlos Alberto on the right flank for the final score. Carlos Alberto's goal, after a series of moves by the Brazilian team from the left to the centre, is considered one of the greatest goals ever scored in the history of the tournament.\nA total of 8 outfield players from Brazil passed the ball until Captain Carlos Alberto hammered the ball into the corner of the Italian goal following an inch perfect pass across the Italian 18 yard box from Pelé, prompted by the intelligent Tostão, who, with his back to the goal, told Pelé that Alberto was steaming in on the right flank. Tostão started the move 5 yards from the left of the Brazilian 18 yard box, then ran the length of the field to the Italian box without touching the ball again to tell Pelé to lay it off for Alberto. The players involved in the passes in order were Tostão, Brito, Clodoaldo, Pelé, Gérson, defender Clodoaldo beat 4 Italian players in his own half before passing to Rivellino who hit a perfect pass down the wing to Jairzinho. Jairzinho crossed from the wing to the centre of the box to Pelé who held the ball up to play a pass for Alberto to smash it home. The only outfield players not involved in the move were Everaldo and Piazza. The full team was Carlos Alberto, Felix, Piazza, Brito, Clodoaldo, Everaldo Antonio, Jairzinho, Gérson, Tostão, Pelé and Rivellino. Brazil won the World Cup with 19 goals scored by 7 players, all of whom featured in the Carlos Alberto goal. Before the finals in Mexico, Brazil had to play the qualifying rounds against Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay. Brazil was far superior winning all 6 games, scoring 23 goals and conceding only 2. In the last match of the qualifying rounds Brazil beat Paraguay 1 – 0 and had the largest official audience ever recorded for a football match, with 183,341 spectators in Brazil's Maracanã Stadium. In total the Brazilian team won all 12 games, scoring 42 goals and conceding only 8.\nWith this third win after their 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories, Brazil became the world's most successful national football team at that time, surpassing both Italy and Uruguay, who each had two championships. Brazil also earned the right to retain the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently. (However, it was stolen in 1983 while on display in Rio de Janeiro and never recovered.) Brazilian coach Mário Zagallo was the first footballer to become World Cup champion as a player (1958, 1962) and a coach, and Pelé ended his World Cup playing career as the first (and so far only) three-time winner."

He took the reins of his alma mater in a tumultuous period after Gary Andersen quit on October 9, six games in to his third season. Oregon State was in the four seasons before Smith's arrival.\nSmith broke through in his fourth season in 2021, posting his first winning record at 7–6 and receiving an invite to the LA Bowl. The Beavers improved in 2022, posting the third ten-win season in program history after soundly defeating Florida 30–3 in the Las Vegas Bowl.\nSmith's initial five-year deal in 2017 paid him $1.9 million annually and automatically extended by one year after every six-win season. On January 7, 2020, Smith received a three-year extension through the 2025 season. After his first winning season in 2021, Smith's contract was rewritten, keeping him signed through the 2027 season and calling for him to make $3.25 million beginning in the 2022 season. After a historic season for the program in 2022, including a win over rival Oregon, Smith's received a new deal with another significant pay increase; the new six-year deal raised his salary to $4.85 million beginning in 2023. Smith's new deal reportedly placed him at fifth in the Pac-12 in compensation, including ahead of his in-state counterpart Dan Lanning.\nMichigan State.\nSmith was officially named Michigan State's head coach on November 25, 2023. The position had been vacant since late September, after Mel Tucker's employment was terminated.\nHead coaching record.\nCollege.\n "

Due to leading scorers KT Harrell and Chris Denson being in foul trouble, the Tigers struggled to pull away, but won thanks to the strength of freshman Tahj Shamsid-Deen, who had a career high 16 points in the 78–73 win.\nDecember.\nThe Tigers visited Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa, on December 2 to take on the #17 Iowa State Cyclones as part of the Big 12/SEC Challenge. Despite 27 points from Denson, Auburn's cold-shooting from the field (35%) and a career game from Iowa State's Dustin Hogue (22 points, 16 rebounds), allowed the Cyclones to improve to 6–0 with a 99–70 win. Following the loss, Auburn traveled to Atlanta to take on Illinois on a neutral court. The Tigers once again struggled to shoot and were down 41–17 at halftime, but mounted a small comeback and lost by a final score of 81–62.\nSchedule and results.\nSource: \n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#172240; color:#FE3300;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#172240; color:#FE3300;\"| Non-conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#172240; color:#FE3300;\"| Conference games\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#172240; color:#FE3300;\" | SEC Tournament\nNOTES:"

The statue was sculpted by Charles Keck and was the third of four works commissioned from members of the National Sculpture Society by philanthropist Paul Goodloe McIntire. It was the second of three statues McIntire donated to the city of Charlottesville, which he did over a period of five years from 1919 to 1924. The statue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\nControversy and removal.\nIn April 2016, the Charlottesville City Council appointed a special commission, named the Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Monuments and Public Spaces, to recommend to city officials how to best handle issues surrounding Confederate statues and monuments in Charlottesville. In February 2017, as part of the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, the Charlottesville City Council voted 3–2 for the statue's removal, along with the Robert E. Lee Monument; both were vandalized in September 2019, with \"1619\" graffitied on the Jackson statue, in reference to the date of the arrival of the first Africans in Virginia. It was vandalized again in October 2019. On July 10, 2021, the city council removed the statues of Jackson and Lee."

This was the 67th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held, and the 120th year overall in which an NCAA school fielded a team.\nConference realignment.\nThe March 2011 announcement that the Big Ten Conference would start sponsoring men's ice hockey in the 2013–14 season, which came shortly after Penn State had announced that it would upgrade its team from club to full varsity status effective in 2012–13, led to a major wave of conference realignment in that sport. Once the Big Ten took the ice with six teams, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) faced the loss of three of its mainstays (Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State), while the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) was set to lose two prominent members (Minnesota and Wisconsin).\nSeveral CCHA and WCHA members then entered into talks to break away from their current leagues to form a new conference; six of these schools would soon form the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC), which would also take the ice in 2013–14. Further moves by both the NCHC and WCHA would eventually lead to the demise of the CCHA after the 2012–13 season. The upheaval also gave Hockey East its first non-New England member in Notre Dame.\nIn the end, the only conferences that neither gained nor lost members for 2013–14 were Atlantic Hockey and ECAC Hockey. The former conference would go on to lose UConn to Hockey East, which was already home to the school's women's team, for the 2014–15 season.\nSeason Outlook.\nPre-season polls.\nThe top teams in the nation as ranked before the start of the season.\nThe U.S. College Hockey Online poll was voted on by coaches, media, and NHL scouts.

        "text": "This is a record of Slovakia's results at the FIFA World Cup, including those of Czechoslovakia which is considered as theirs and the Czech Republic's predecessor by FIFA. The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently takes place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) for about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nCzechoslovakia has been one of the better performing national teams in the history of the World Cup, having ended twice as runners-up, in 1934 and in 1962. Between 1930 and 1994 they qualified for 8 out of 13 World Cups they played qualifiers for, and did not enter in two other World Cups.\nAfter the political and peaceful split-up into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the official successor football teams of the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been less successful at the World Cup than Czechoslovakia, qualifying only for one out of the seven tournaments held since (the 2010 FIFA World Cup) without surviving the group phase and got eliminated in the last 16 respectively.\nThroughout the World Cup history, Brazil became the team's historical rival. The two countries have met each other five times but the Czechs and Slovaks (always Czechoslovakia) never managed to win, with three victories for the Brazilian side and two draws. Two other historical opponents in the finals were (West) Germany and Italy with three encounters each: Czechoslovakia won, drew and lost once against the Germans and the matches against Italy all ended in a defeat.\nSlovakia at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nSlovakia were drawn in group F of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nCoach: Vladimír Weiss\nSecond Round - Netherlands vs Slovakia.\nThe Netherlands and Slovakia played on 28 June 2010 at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. The Netherlands won 2–1. The Netherlands' first goal was an excellent individual effort from Arjen Robben in the 18th minute, taking on the Slovakian defence with the ball before scoring from 25 yards. The Dutch had chances to extend their lead in the second half; Arjen Robben cut inside on his left foot just like he did when he scored the first goal, but this time the slovak goalkeeper Jan Mucha saved the shot going to his far post. The Slovaks also had 2 big opportunities to equalize but forced 2 great saves from Maarten Stekelenburg. The Dutch however in the 84th minute sealed their win, with Wesley Sneijder scoring off an assist from Dirk Kuyt into an unguarded net after Kuyt got the ball past the Slovak keeper. Róbert Vittek slotted a penalty kick late in stoppage time, but it was no more than a consolation goal for Slovakia. The penalty had been awarded for a trip on Vittek by the Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. The Netherlands' win threatened to be overshadowed by Robin van Persie responding angrily to being substituted by coach Bert van Marwijk. Van Marwijk called a team meeting over the incident, and insisted later that there was no residual unrest in the squad.\nRecord players.\nExcluding Czechoslovakia's records, six players played in all four matches Slovakia played in 2010, making them record players for their country."

It was the second-largest crowd in Kentucky Derby history. Uncle Sigh and Chitu set the early pace, as jockey Victor Espinoza held California Chrome back in third, a bit off the pace. Coming around the final turn, California Chrome and then fourth place Samraat made a move, surging past the pace setters. The two horses remained neck-and-neck for several strides before California Chrome broke away and coasted to finish line, winning by 1 3/4 lengths. Long-shot Commanding Curve came from well back to claim second, while Danza took third. Wicked Strong placed fourth and Samraat faded to fifth. For the win, California Chrome took home $1.418 million of the $2.178 million purse.\nCalifornia Chrome became the first California-bred horse to win the Derby since Decidedly in 1962. For Espinoza, it was his second Kentucky Derby win, his first coming in 2002 when he rode War Emblem to victory. After the race, trainer Art Sherman called Espinoza's ride \"perfect\". At age 77, Sherman is the oldest trainer to win the race. His only previous experience at Churchill Downs was in 1955, when he was an exercise rider for Swaps. Swaps won the Derby that year. Interviewed after the race, Sherman emotionally remarked, \"Well, when I went to Swaps' grave the other day I said a little prayer and it came true. I said I hope [California Chrome] is another Swaps.\"\nBy pedigree, California Chrome was an unlikely winner. The combination of his humble roots and those of his connections prompted the Associated Press to remark, \"Even Hollywood couldn't have made this up.\" He is the offspring of a mare, Love the Chase, purchased for $8,000, and a stallion, Lucky Pulpit, that stood for a $2,000 stud fee. The horse is owned by \"a couple of working stiff owners\", Perry Martin and Steve Coburn, who spent what they could afford in the hopes of producing a great race horse. California Chrome trains at Los Alamitos Race Course in Orange County. His Derby win was his fifth straight win, a streak which began in December 2013. His margin of victory in these races was a combined total of 26 lengths.\nCoburn, who predicted that California Chrome would win the Derby, also predicted his horse would be the first California-bred winner of the Triple Crown. Rival trainers conceded it was plausible. Trainer Dale Romans, who had said California Chrome had no chance to win the Derby, remarked, \"I was very, very wrong ... We might have just seen a super horse and a super trainer.\"\nResults.\nTrack – Fast\nTimes: mile – 23.04; mile – 47.37; mile – 1:11.80; mile – 1:37.45; final – 2:03.66.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.04) (24.33) (24.34) (25.65) (26.21)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayout.\nThe Kentucky Derby Payout Schedule\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nCalifornia Chrome was the only starter in the Derby who went on to win at the Grade I level.

        "text": "Tonga sent a delegation to compete at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia from 7–23 February 2014. This was the Pacific island nation's debut at the Winter Olympic Games. The Tongan delegation consisted of one luge athlete, Bruno Banani, who had changed his name in a marketing gimmick to match that of German brand Bruno Banani. In his event, the men's singles, he came in 32nd place out of 39 competitors.\nBackground.\nThe Tonga Sports Association and National Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1984. The Kingdom made its Olympic debut at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and has appeared at every Summer Olympic Games since then. These Sochi Olympics were the Kingdom's debut at the Winter Olympic Games. The 2014 Winter Olympics were held from 7–23 February 2014; a total of 2,780 athletes representing 88 National Olympic Committees took part. Bruno Banani, a luger, was the only athlete Tonga sent to Sochi. Banani was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and closing ceremony.\nLuge.\nTonga qualified for a place in the men's singles when Bruno Banani finished in the top 38 (with a maximum of three per nation qualifying) during an event in the 2013–14 Luge World Cup. He took up luge in 2009 having previously trained in rugby, and had failed to qualify for the 2010 Winter Olympics by being a single point short after crashing in the final qualifying race. Banani, whose birth name is Fuahea Semi, had attracted media attention by changing his name to that of a German lingerie company, as part of a marketing ploy. His name change was criticised by International Olympic Committee Vice President Thomas Bach, who described it as being \"in bad taste\".\nBanani was 26 years old at the time of the Sochi Olympics. The men's singles competition was held on 8–9 February, with two runs being contested each day; the final mark of each athlete was the sum of all four of their runs. On the first day, Banani's run times were 53.656 seconds and 53.637 seconds. Overnight, he was in 33rd place out of 39 competitors, and three seconds behind the leader. On the second day, he posted run times of 53.162 seconds and 53.221 seconds for his fourth and final run. Banani finished 32nd out of 39 competitors, with a combined time of 3 minutes and 33.676 seconds. Felix Loch of Germany won the gold medal with a total time of 3 minutes and 27.526 seconds, the silver medal was taken by Albert Demchenko of Russia, and the bronze medal was earned by Armin Zöggeler of Italy."

This marked the return of the Virgin Islands to the Winter Olympics after missing the 2010 edition, and was their sixth time competing at a Winter Olympic Games. The USVI team consisted of one athlete in alpine skiing, Jasmine Campbell. She finished 56th in the giant slalom and 43rd in the slalom.\nBackground.\nThe Virgin Islands Olympic Committee was first recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1966. The USVI have sent competitors to every Summer Olympic Games since, except the boycotted 1980 Moscow Olympics. The territory first sent athletes to a Winter Olympic Games in 1988. The USVI had their only athlete at the 2006 Winter Olympics—Anne Abernathy—break her wrist in training, and they missed the 2010 Winter Olympics, making Sochi the sixth time the USVI actually competed in the Winter Olympics. Alpine skier Jasmine Campbell was the only athlete the USVI sent to Sochi. Campbell was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and closing ceremony. She was accompanied to Sochi by her coach and father, John Campbell, who had represented the Virgin Islands at the 1992 Winter Olympics in alpine skiing..\nAlpine skiing.\nThe Virgin Islands qualified one female alpine skier for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Jasmine Campbell secured qualification on 20 January 2014. She was born on Saint John, USVI and moved to Idaho at the age of nine. Campbell was 22 years old at the time of the Sochi Olympics, and was making her Olympic debut. About her Olympic participation she said \"I will consider my time at the Olympics a success by doing my own personal best, while connecting with this very special community of athletes. I greatly appreciate this immense honor to participate in such a unique international forum whose goal is to be a symbol of human excellence and transcendence, in an environment of peace.\" On 18 February she took part in the two-run women's giant slalom race. She finished the first leg in 1 minute and 32.05 seconds, and the second in 1 minute and 33.00 seconds. Her total time of 3 minutes and 5.05 seconds put her in 56th place, out of 67 competitors who finished both legs of the race. The gold medal was won by Tina Maze of Slovenia in a time of 2 minutes and 36.87 seconds; the silver medal was won by Anna Fenninger of Austria, and the bronze was earned by Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany.\nOn 21 February, Campbell participated in the women's slalom, which was also a two-run event. She completed her first run in 1 minute and 6.09 seconds, and her second in a faster 1 minute and 4.28 seconds. Her total time for the event was thus 2 minutes and 10.37 seconds, which put her in 43rd place out of 49 competitors who completed both runs. The gold medal was won by Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States in 1 minute and 44.54 seconds; silver and bronze were both earned by Austrians, Marlies Schild and Kathrin Zettel respectively."

Odeva and Plastika Nitra, which were the leading teams in the early 1970s with three and two championships respectively, were followed by Inter Bratislava with three titles in the second half of the 1970s, Štart Bratislava which also won three until 1983, Iskra Partizánske and ZVL Prešov with four each in the 1980s, and lastly Slovan Dusľo Šaľa, which emerged in the early 1990s.\nThe championship was discontinued in 1993 after the Czechoslovak communist system collapsed and the country was dissolved, with the Czech Republic and Slovakia creating their own championships.

His best singles performance was reaching the fourth round at the 1954 US Championships as the seventh–seeded foreign player. In the fourth round he lost in straight sets to Ham Richardson.\nHe retired from playing tennis in 1959 at the age of 27. After his playing career he became a tournament director. In the early 1960s he became the tournament director of the South African Tennis Championships. Under his directorship the tournament grew in popularity and stature and became one of the main tournaments on the tour. In early 1969, Williams became Tournament Director of the US Open at Forest Hills, the first full-time director in the tournament's history. That same year the African American tennis player Arthur Ashe requested a visa to participate in the South African Open but was denied by the South African authorities. In the following years he was again refused a visa, but in 1973 his visa application was finally granted and he accepted Williams' invitation to participate in the tournament on the condition that the spectator stands would be racially integrated. Afterwards Ashe and Williams established the Black Tennis Foundation aimed at making tennis accessible to every black child in South Africa. In 1981 Williams was hired as CEO of Lamar Hunt's World Championship Tennis (WCT) circuit and remained in that position until the WCT disbanded in 1990.\nIn addition to his tennis activities, Williams founded, owned and operated several businesses ventures including distributorships in Scotch whisky, chocolate liqueur and champagne, a sporting goods firm, a small publishing company and a public relations company. As part of the deal to sign Williams for the WCT organization, Lamar Hunt purchased his South African businesses in 1981.\nIn 1998, Williams partnered with chess legend Garry Kasparov to form Sports Management Strategies International in Palm Beach, Florida."

In the history of the school, Illinois has only had one worse finish, the 1998-99 season, where they ended the year in eleventh place. However, the 1998-99 team played for the Big Ten tournament championship, losing to Michigan State in the championship game.\nThe 1973-74 season also witnessed the conclusion of a very difficult tenure at the position of head coach. Harv Schmidt, a former player turned head coach, finished his seventh season at Illinois with an overall record of 89 wins and 77 losses. Unfortunately for Schmidt, several situations contributed to his demise, most of the problems being not of his doing. He was a disciplinarian and demanded attention to detail. He worked his players hard yet he was fair and considerate of their needs.

Under FIBA's organization, the competition was initially called the FIBA European Champions' Cup, and was later first re-named to the FIBA European League, and finally to the FIBA EuroLeague. During the 2000–01 season, the competition was split into two different leagues for just that one season.\nThere was the then newly formed 2000–01 EuroLeague competition organized by EuroLeague Basketball (EB), which kept the majority of the major clubs in the competition, as well as its EuroLeague name.

While the EuroLeague Basketball competition kept the original EuroLeague name of the competition, FIBA's league kept the original ending format of the competition, as it retained the EuroLeague Final Four event, which was re-named from the FIBA EuroLeague Final Four, to the FIBA SuproLeague Final Four.\nFor the following 2001–02 season, FIBA cancelled its SuproLeague competition, and EuroLeague Basketball's competition gained all of the competition's major clubs, as well as the Final Four format, which was then re-named back to the EuroLeague Final Four. EuroLeague Basketball's competition officially recognized all of the seasons of FIBA's competitions, including all of its Finals, Final Fours, league champions, stats, records, and awards. The stats, records, and awards from the two competitions are categorized by each individual organizing body (EB and FIBA).\nPoints scored has been kept as an official basketball stat of the EuroLeague, since its inaugural 1958 season.

The tournament is held during the first week of September.\nHistory.\nOn the right shore of the river Velika Morava is located one of the oldest stables named Ljubičevo stable. In this place, before the stable was founded, there was a large agricultural property of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia called \"Morava\". In April 1860, Miloš donated his property to the country. At the same time, Miloš ordered that the stable from a place called Ćuprija is moved to his property, that stable was established earlier by Aleksandar Karađordević. The only thing left in Ćuprija was the branch Dobričevo and by the fall of that year the big stable was built in Ljubičevo and the entire complex was moved there. During the governance of prince Mihajlo in 1866 when the headmaster was Aga Jefta, in the honor of princess Ljubica, wife of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia, the agricultural property was named Ljubičevo.\nDunavsko kolo.\nAt the end of the 19th century, founding the Dunavsko kolo, riders club named \"Knez Mihajlo\" in Požarevac the horse racing tournaments begin. This kind of tournaments took place more than a few times in one year, especially during September. One of those tournaments took place on Sunday 4 September 1932 on the track \"Mihailovac\" at 3 p.m.\nHorse exhibit in Ljubičevo.\nBesides horse racing, the riders of Dunavsko kolo \"Knez Mihajlo\" from Požarevac also organized a horse exhibit. The horse exhibit was located in the area of the barracks of the Ninth Infantry regiment at nine o'clock in the morning. The exhibit was divided into 7 competitive classes depending on age and fertility. The main sponsor of the exhibit was the Ministry of Agriculture which donated to the riders of Dunavsko kolo an aid of 2000 dinars. The riders from its own resources acquire urale, zobnice and četke so that all the exhibit horses can get one of those items. During the exhibit they gave awards for each category, 1st place 300 dinars, 2nd place 200 dinars and 3rd 100 dinars. The panel of judges which evaluated horses consisted of the most competent people of Požarevac, who worked on the horse breeding plan. Members of the panel were: director of Public stable\"Ljubičevo\" Miloš Radosavljević, headmaster of agricultural school Jovan Dulić, veterinarian consultment Petar Savić and Živojin Perić from Pozarevac. Along with participation of over 100 horses from Požarevac and the whole country, couple of breed horses from Požarevac took the awards from all categories.\nBeginnings of equestrian tournaments.\nIn the afternoon, the same day, the tournament was held on the race track \"Mihailovac\". Four separated races were held: race of dvogoda, fertile male and female, born in 1930 in the country. The length of the track was 1200m. Load for the male was 58 kg, for the female 56 kg, while the halfblooded wore 5 kg less. Second race was for male and female born in 1929 in the country. Length of the track was 1800 m. Third race was for all horses 3 years and older. Length of the track was 2400 m. Fourth race was for the chosen horses of the Public stable \"Ljubicevo\".

Exhibit and horse racing attracted a large number of participants and viewers, and by the reports of that time, it was a total success because it raised interest in horse breeding. Then, as well as today, in the time of Equestrian tournament, there is also a rich cultural program organized for the visitors.

        "text": "The South Africa and Pakistan national cricket teams toured the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 14 October to 15 November 2013. The tour included two Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 Internationals (T20I)\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nSouth African captain, Graeme Smith, who was playing his first Test after recovery from his ankle injury, won the toss and elected to bat first. Jacques Kallis was also playing his first Test since last February. Hashim Amla's partnerships of 61 runs for the fourth wicket with AB de Villiers (19), and 95 runs for the fifth with Jean-Paul Duminy (57) stopped the Pakistani bowlers who have ruined their top-order, with 43 for three. Zulfiqar Babar and Shan Masood – on his twenty-fourth birthday – made their Test debuts for Pakistan. Zulfiqar, a left arm spinner, was most successful taking three wickets for 89. Amla reached his twentieth century in 201 balls, and at the end of the day, he was unbeaten on 118, with South Africa on 245 for eight wickets.\nSouth Africa were restricted to 249 runs in 93.1 overs, and Mohammad Irfan finished with three wickets for 44 runs in 18.2 overs. Younus Khan equaled Javed Miandad's record for Pakistan taking his ninety-third catch in Test cricket; he caught Amla off the bowling of Irfan. Pakistan started their innings with a new opening pair – Khurram Manzoor and Masood – who put on a century partnership of 135 runs. This was the first century-stand from Pakistani openers since January. Masood started his innings with a boundary off Dale Steyn, and scored 75 runs on his debut, before given leg before wicket off Duminy's bowling. At the end of the second day, Manzoor was unbeaten on 131 runs, and Pakistan were 263 runs for three wickets.\nManzoor scored 146 runs before falling to Philander; he surpassed Azhar Mahmood's 136 runs and became the highest run-scorer in a Test innings by a Pakistani batsman against South Africa. Misbah-ul-Haq scored 100 runs, his first century since May 2011, and fourth overall in Test cricket. Asad Shafiq added 54 runs, and Pakistan led by 193 in the first innings, scoring 442 runs. Philander took three wickets while conceding 84 runs in 26 overs. At the end of the day, South Africa were 72 for four wickets in 26 overs, with De Villiers on 10 and Steyn on zero.\nNightwatchman, Steyn, was dismissed by Babar on seven. De Villiers, who scored his thirty-third half century in Test cricket, was South African second innings' top scorer, with 90 runs. His partnership of 57 runs with Robin Peterson prevented South Africa from an innings defeat; the latter scored 47 runs not out. South Africa took their total to 232 runs in 82.4 overs, this left Pakistan a target of only 40 runs. Saeed Ajmal took four wickets for 74 runs. Pakistan lost their first three wickets for seven runs while chasing the target. They achieved the target in the fourteenth over, with a six hit by Misbah over Peterson. This was Pakistan's fourth consecutive win against a world's no.1 Test team in the UAE; they remained unbeaten for the ninth consecutive time there. South Africa lost for the first time a Test since 2011, after 15 consecutive unbeaten matches. Adnan Akmal and Peterson were fined 50% of their match fee by the International Cricket Council (ICC), due to violation of \"Article 2.2.4 of the ICC Code of Conduct for players and player support personnel\"."

However, he failed to retain any of these, losing to Novak Djokovic, Radek Štěpánek and Grigor Dimitrov at each of these tournaments.\nHis form improved in the latter part of the season, as he won 3 titles in 5 weeks at Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia. This saw him finish the year ranked world number 6.\nYearly Summary.\nAustralian Open Series.\nQatar Open.\nMurray made his competitive return to the tour at the Qatar Open, having been out injured since undergoing back surgery in September 2013. He faced local wildcard Mousa Shanan Zayed and took only 37 minutes to defeat him, not dropping a single game in the process. He then suffered a shock defeat to Florian Mayer in the following round. Having been in a commanding position, Murray lost 12 of the last 15 games to crash out in three sets.\nAustralian Open.\nMurray then competed at the Australian Open. He got his campaign underway in difficult conditions, with temperatures in excess of 40 degrees Celsius, against Go Soeda and saw him off in under 90 minutes, only dropping five games in the process. He next faced qualifier Vincent Millot and again won in straight sets, recovering from 5–1 down in the third to take it 7–5 by winning 23 consecutive points from set point down. Murray's first serious test came from Feliciano López but the top 30 player failed to trouble him as he secured another set victory, to set up a fourth round clash with lucky loser Stéphane Robert. Murray dropped his first set of the tournament in a third set tie-break but recovered to take the fourth and progress to the quarter-finals. There he faced Roger Federer, in their fifth meeting at a Grand Slam. Murray was unable to match Federer's level throughout most of the match and was defeated in four sets, ending his run of four consecutive Australian Open semi-finals.\nSpring hardcourt season.\nDavis Cup First round.\nMurray then represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup against the United States in San Diego. He won both his singles rubbers, first defeating Donald Young and then securing the 3–1 victory on the Sunday with a win over Sam Querrey. It was the first time that Great Britain had reached the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup since 1986.\nRotterdam Open.\nFollowing the Davis Cup tie, Murray travelled to Rotterdam to play in the Rotterdam Open. There he overcame Édouard Roger-Vasselin and Dominic Thiem to set up a quarter-final encounter with Marin Čilić. Murray struggled against Čilić, playing for the three consecutive days for the first time since surgery, and was unable to find his best form as he crashed out in straight sets.\nMexican Open.\nAfter his defeat to Čilić, Murray next chose to play in the Mexican Open for the first time. He recovered from a set down in his opener to defeat Pablo Andújar, and then overcame João Sousa to reach the quarter-finals. Again, Murray failed to find his best form but still managed to record his 12th consecutive win over Gilles Simon. In his first semi-final since winning Wimbledon the previous year, Murray suffered a three sets defeat to Grigor Dimitrov. Murray took the first set but then lost two close tie-breaks as Dimitorv recorded his first win over Murray.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nMurray headed into the first Masters Series tournament of the year still struggling to find form. Matters failed to improve at the Indian Wells Masters as he struggled past Lukáš Rosol and Jiří Veselý, before being eliminated in the fourth round by Milos Raonic in a match where Murray admitted he \"wasn't good enough\". Following the tournament, Murray mutually split with his coach Ivan Lendl, ending their partnership after two years together.\nMurray offered to play with 2012 Wimbledon Doubles champion Jonathan Marray because Marray was unable to convince anyone to join him on court. Marray was struggling for full fitness and finding a regular doubles partner, travelling to tournaments with no plan whatsoever.\nAfter fans queued around the grounds to watch Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka play together, it was standing room only for Murray and Marray's first competitive match together. Andy Murray and Jonny Marray won a thrilling doubles clash against Gaël Monfils and Juan Mónaco only to lose in the second round to the No 2 seeds Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.\nMiami Masters.\nAt the Miami Masters Murray began his title defence with a win over Matthew Ebden, recovering to take 12 of the last 13 games having lost the first set. Murray then turned in two of his better performances of the season to defeat Feliciano López and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach the quarter-finals. The win over Tsonga was Murray's first victory over a top-20 player since his return from surgery. In the quarter-finals Murray took on Novak Djokovic for the first time since they played each other in the previous year's Wimbledon final. Murray was defeated in straight sets although the first set ended in controversial fashion with Djokovic playing a volley with his racquet over the net which the umpire allowed to stand. The defeat saw Murray slip to eighth in the world, his lowest ranking since 2008.\nEuropean clay court season.\nDavis Cup Quarterfinals.\nGreat Britain faced Italy in the Davis Cup quarter-finals. Murray defeated Andreas Seppi in his opening rubber, although the conclusion of the match was delayed until the Saturday following a rain delay. Murray then had to play again on the Saturday as he teamed up with fellow Scot Colin Fleming to defeat Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini in the doubles rubber and put Britain 2–1 up. On the Sunday, Murray had to play his third best of five match in the space of two days as he took on Fognini in the reverse singles. The intense schedule proved too much for Murray as he was defeated in straight sets, ending his run of 19 consecutive Davis Cup singles wins which stretched back to his first appearance in the competition in 2005. James Ward then lost the decider to Seppi as Britain were defeated 3–2 and eliminated from the competition.\nMadrid Open.\nMurray's first clay court tournament of the year was the Madrid Open. Murray opened up with a close three set victory over Nicolás Almagro, but his poor form on clay continued as he lost to qualifier Santiago Giraldo in the following round.\nItalian Open.\nThe Italian Open seemed to signal an upturn in Murray's fortunes. He first dismissed Marcel Granollers in straight sets, and was then equally as clinical as he celebrated his 27th birthday with a win over Jürgen Melzer to set up a quarter-final meeting with Rafael Nadal. In their first meeting since October 2011, Murray seized the early initiative and took the first set 6–1, but Nadal battled back to take the second. In the decider, Murray moved out to a 4–2 lead and was within touching distance of recording his first win over Nadal on clay. However, he was unable to see the match out and Nadal recovered to take the third 7–5.\nFrench Open.\nMurray began his French Open with a four sets win over Andrey Golubev, and then defeated Marinko Matosevic to set up a third round match with Philipp Kohlschreiber. The 28th seeded German proved a much tougher prospect and after Murray failed to see out the match from a commanding position in the fourth set, play was abandoned due to bad light at 7–7 in the deciding fifth set. Despite having never been beyond 7–5 in a decider, Murray held his nerve to take it 12–10 when play resumed the following day. He then returned the next day to take on Fernando Verdasco, but this match proved less troublesome with Murray picking up the win in straight sets. In the quarter-finals, Murray played childhood friend Gaël Monfils and stormed into a two set lead. Monfils hit back though, winning the next two to take it to a decider. Despite the momentum seeming to be against Murray, he turned the match round spectacularly to take the final set 6–0 and reach the semi-finals, equalling his best ever result at the French Open. The result saw him become only the 10th man to reach multiple semi-finals at all four Grand Slams and also reach a British-record 14th Grand Slam semi-final. In the semi-finals he faced Rafael Nadal for the second consecutive tournament. Nadal was at his best throughout the match and Murray struggled to keep up, weakened by the two long, five-set matches he had already played. In the end, Nadal saw off Murray in under two hours, winning comfortably in straight sets.\nGrass court season.\nQueen's Club Championships.\nPrior to the grass court season beginning, Murray appointed Amélie Mauresmo as his new coach. It was a surprise move which saw Mauresmo become the first woman to coach a high-profile male player. In their first tournament together, Murray recorded a straight sets win over Paul-Henri Mathieu as he attempted to defend his Queen's Club Championship title. However, he suffered a shock defeat to Radek Štěpánek in the following round, ending his 19 match win streak which stretched back to his 2012 Wimbledon final defeat to Roger Federer.\nWimbledon.\nMurray then attempted to become the first British man to defend a Wimbledon title since Fred Perry in 1936. He began his defence with a comfortable straight sets win over David Goffin, his 450th career win, and followed that up with an emphatic win over Blaž Rola in which he only dropped two games. His first real test was against 27th seed Roberto Bautista Agut, but the Spaniard proved no match for Murray who raced to another straight sets win in just over an hour and a half. Murray then defeated big serving Kevin Anderson, the 20th seed, to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final. His defence then came to an abrupt halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak at Wimbledon with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2008.\nUS Open Series.\nCanadian Open.\nDespite his ranking dropping to 10th after Wimbledon, withdrawals from Nadal and del Potro meant that Murray was seeded eighth for the Canadian Open and thus received a first round bye. Before the tournament began, Murray announced that he would be extending his partnership with Mauresmo until at least the end of the US Open but was ideally looking for a long-term deal. Murray also revealed that he hadn't been able to train fully earlier in the year following his back surgery last September, but had now returned to a full training schedule. In his opening match at the Canadian Open he faced wild card Nick Kyrgios, who had also been a Wimbledon quarter-finalist after upsetting Rafael Nadal. However, Murray faced no such issues with the Australian teenager and recorded a straight sets win in just under an hour. Murray then advanced to the quarter-finals after Richard Gasquet withdrew before their third round match with an abdominal injury. Murray was defeated at the quarter-final stage by eventual champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, despite having been a break up in the final set.\nCincinnati Masters.\nAs with the Canadian Open, Murray received a first round bye at the Cincinnati Masters as the eight seed. He recorded a straight sets win over João Sousa in the second round, and then in the third round defeated 2013 finalist John Isner in a third set tie-break, having earlier saved two match points. He faced world No. 3 Roger Federer for a place in the semi-finals, but was defeated in straight sets. Murray had a double-break lead in the second set, but lost six of the last seven games to exit the tournament. As with the previous tournament, Murray lost to the eventual winner, with Federer going on to take the title two days later.\nUS Open.\nMurray went into the US Open as the eighth seed, his lowest seeding at a major since Wimbledon 2008. In the first round he faced Robin Haase where he looked to be heading for a routine straight sets victory. However, early in the third set, Murray suffered a bout of cramp and Haase was able to claw his way back into the match. It looked to be going all the way to a deciding set but Murray was able to come back from a break down to take the match in four. In the second round Murray defeated qualifier Matthias Bachinger in straight sets to set up a first meeting with Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round. He came through that encounter in four sets to set up a third meeting of the season with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray won in straight sets to record his first win over a top 10 player since his 2013 Wimbledon final victory over Novak Djokovic. It was Djokovic who he faced at the quarter-final stage of the tournament. In their 21st meeting the Serb proved to be too much for Murray, taking the win in four sets in a late match that lasted over three and a half hours.\nPost–US Open tournaments.\nShenzhen Open.\nMurray played his first tournament after the US Open when he took a wildcard into the Shenzhen Open, as the second seed. After receiving a bye in the first round he defeated Somdev Devvarman in the round of sixteen in straight sets to set up a quarter-final meeting with Lukáš Lacko. Murray again won in straight sets to reach the semi-finals. Murray had to recover from a set down to overcome Juan Mónaco and advance to his first final since winning Wimbledon the previous year. Murray picked up his first title of the season against Tommy Robredo, coming back after being a set down once again and saving five match points in the process.\nChina Open.\nThe following week, Murray faced Jerzy Janowicz in the first round of the China Open, winning in three sets. In the second round he faced Pablo Cuevas, winning easily in straight sets, to set up a quarter-final meeting with US Open champion Marin Čilić. Murray obtained his second top 10 win of the season with a comfortable straight sets win. He then lost to world no. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semi-final in straight sets.\nShanghai Masters.\nMurray began the final leg of the Asian swing with a straight sets win over qualifier Teymuraz Gabashvili at the Shanghai Masters. Murray then faced Jerzy Janowicz for the second consecutive tournament, but this match proved to be easier than their previous encounter, with Murray winning in straight sets. His run was ended in third round by David Ferrer, as the fifth seed recovered from a set down to beat Murray in three sets.\nVienna Open.\nIn an attempt to qualify for the World Tour Finals, Murray took a wild card into the Vienna Open. He defeated Vasek Pospisil in straight sets after receiving a first round bye to reach the quarter-final. More straight sets wins over Jan-Lennard Struff and Viktor Troicki followed as Murray reached the final. He once again faced David Ferrer, and triumphed in three sets for his second title of the season, and the 30th of his career.\nValencia Open.\nContinuing his attempt to qualify for the World Tour Finals, Murray entered the Valencia Open as a wild card. He defeated Jürgen Melzer and Fabio Fognini in straight sets to reach the quarter-finals, where he recovered from a set down against Kevin Anderson. In the semi-final he faced David Ferrer for the third time in as many weeks, and won in straight sets to set up a repeat of the Shenzhen Open final against Tommy Robredo. Murray defeated Robredo to take the title, and, in a repeat of the Shenzhen final, had to come from a set behind and save 5 match points to prevail.\nParis Masters.\nAs the eighth seed, Murray received a bye in the first round of the Paris Masters. He opened with a straight sets win over Julien Benneteau in the second round. Murray then defeated Grigor Dimitrov in just over an hour to advance to the quarter-finals and seal his place at the end of season tour finals. Murray then attempted to record his first win of the season over Novak Djokovic, but it was the Serb who again came out on top in their fourth meeting, in what was also Murray's 23rd match in the space of 37 days.\nATP World Tour Finals.\nMurray was drawn in Group B at the ATP World Tour Finals, along with Roger Federer, Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic. In his opening match, Murray was defeated in straight sets by Nishikori. It was his first loss to him, with Murray having won their previous three meetings. He bounced back in his second match, overcoming Raonic in straight sets. Murray went into his final group match with Federer knowing that a straight sets win was required in order to reach the semi-finals. However, he was thrashed in under an hour, winning only one game, and so was eliminated – finishing third in the group.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Murray in 2014, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins. They are marked ND for non-decision or no decision.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins\""

        "title": "2001–02 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2001–02 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2001–02 NCAA Division I college basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by Craig Esherick and played most of their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC, although they played some home games early in the season at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus. The Hoyas were members of the West Division of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 19–11, 9–7 in Big East play. They advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2002 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Miami in overtime. Missing an at-large bid to the 2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Georgetown instead received an invitation to play in the 2002 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), but declined it and had no postseason play, the first Georgetown men's basketball team since the 1973-74 season to appear in neither the NCAA Tournament or the NIT.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown entered the season anticipating that sophomore power forward Mike Sweetney, freshman forward Harvey Thomas, and junior center Wesley Wilson would make up an imposing frontcourt. Thomas, who averaged 5.2 points and 2.5 rebounds a game, and Wilson, who averaged 12.2 points and 6.2 rebounds, played inconsistently all season, but Sweetney remained as dominant as he had been the previous season. He improved his free-throw shooting from 61% the previous year to 79% this season, that change alone accounting for an average of an additional 2.7 points per game. He had 14 double-doubles, including 26 points and 13 rebounds against Rutgers in January 2002. He would complete the season averaging 19.0 points and 10.0 rebounds a game, the first Georgetown player to average at least 15 points and 10 rebounds a game since Alonzo Mourning.\nSenior point guard and team co-captain Kevin Braswell was a leader of the team, starting all 30 games and completing his string of starting all 128 games of his collegiate career. Inconsistent play dogged him during the year as it had throughout his career, however; he shot over 50 percent from the field in only one Big East game during the season and finished the year shooting only 37 percent from the field in conference play.\nSophomore forward Gerald Riley started all 30 games – as he would all 125 games of his collegiate career – and improved his play in many ways from that of his freshman year. His average minutes played per game increased from 17 to 27, and his average points per game increased from 6.7 to 10.3. He shot 81.3 percent from the free-throw line, and in 13 games made every free throw he attempted. He had a 21-point game against West Virginia and scored 18 points against Syracuse.\nThe team opened the season 9–1, but went 9-9 the rest of the way. Its record stood at 14-7 overall, 5–4 in the Big East, when Notre Dame came to the MCI Center for a conference game on February 9, 2002. In the first half, Georgetown focused on getting the ball inside to Sweetney, who had 18 first-half points, and Wilson, who scored 10 in the first half, and as a team scored 35 points inside during the half. Notre Dame, meanwhile, emphasized rebounding and accurate shooting, shooting almost 60 percent from the field in the first half, and opened a 12-point lead. The Hoyas made a 7–0 run to end the half and trailed 48–43 at halftime. In the second half, Georgetown continued to close the gap until tying the score at 61–61 with 13:24 to play. Notre Dame then made a 7–0 run of its own to lead 68–61, but Georgetown closed to a four-point deficit with eight minutes to play, to one point behind on a three pointer by freshman guard Drew Hall (who shot 3-for-3 from beyond the three-point line during the game), and tied the game again on a free throw with 7:29 to play. Over the rest of regulation, both teams played tough defense and shot a combined 3-for-20 (15.0%) from the field. Georgetown had an 84–82 lead when Notre Dame junior guard Matt Carroll sank a two-pointer to tie the score. When the Hoyas managed to stop a late Notre Dame rally, the game went into overtime.\nIn overtime, Notre Dame built a lead, Georgetown caught up, the Fighting Irish took a lead again in the last two minutes, but the Hoyas surged back to tie the game. With 17 seconds left and Georgetown holding the ball for the final shot, Braswell brought the ball down the court, and instead of passing, chose to take a long shot that missed. The second overtime played out the same way, with Notre Dame taking the lead, Georgetown coming back, and Notre Dame again gaining the advantage with under two minutes left. The Hoyas again tied the game and held the ball for the last shot, and Braswell again had the ball; this time he ignored chances to pass the ball inside to Sweetney and to freshman guard Tony Bethel and instead took a low-percentage 30-foot (9.1-meter) shot that missed. The pattern repeated itself in the third overtime; Notre Dame led, Georgetown closed, the Fighting Irish got the lead back in the final two minutes, and the Hoyas came back to tie and had the ball for the last shot. Notre Dame senior forward Ryan Humphrey blocked Gerald Rileys shot, deflecting it to Braswell, who launched a 20-foot (6.1-meter) shot that went through the basket just after the shot clock expired with less than seven-tenths of a second left to play.\nBy the fourth overtime, Wilson had fouled out, junior center-forward and team co-captain Courtland Freeman had been injured, and Riley and Braswell soon also fouled out – Braswell leaving having shot only 5-for-19 (26.3%) from the field and 0-for-4 at three-point range, part of a slump in which he shot 2-for-17 (11.8%) in three-point attempts over a four-game stretch. The final blow to the tiring Hoyas came when Sweetney fouled out after a 35-point, 20-rebound performance, leaving Georgetown with only one of its starting five players still available to play. Notre Dame, with its starters still on the floor, finally pulled away in the last minute to win, 116–111. The 60 minutes of play over the course of regulation and four overtimes had seen the two teams combined take 190 shots, grab 108 rebounds, and take 72 free throw shots, all while committing only 13 turnovers each. The loss dropped Georgetown to 14-8 overall and 5–5 in the Big East, and in retrospect was a turning point in the Esherick era at Georgetown; in the previous 100 games, Eshericks teams had posted a 64-36 (.640) record, but after the loss the Hoyas went 37-33 (.529) under Esherick, who departed after the end of the 2003-04 season.\nA week later, Sweetney shot 11-for-15 (73.4%) from the field and scored 31 points at Villanova, but the rest of the team shot only 11-for-57 (19.3%) from the field as the Hoyas lost another overtime game, 83–72. After losing to Connecticut three days later, the Hoyas embarked on a four-game winning streak in which Sweetney averaged 16 points and 11.5 rebounds. Braswell, meanwhile, scored in double figures in nine straight games to end the season and had a school-record 16 assists against Rutgers in the regular-season home finale, and he finished the year averaging 14.4 points per game for the season and 13.5 points per game for his career.\nGeorgetown finished the regular season with a three-game winning streak, posting a record of 18-10 overall, 9–7 in the Big East, and finishing tied for third place in the conferences West Division. In the 2002 Big East tournament, the Hoyas beat Providence in the first round to stretch their winning streak to four games and raise hopes that they had an outside chance of receiving an invitation to the 2002 NCAA tournament. However, they lost in the quarterfinals to Miami in overtime despite Gerald Rileys 15-point performance, knocking them out of the Big East tournament and out of consideration for an NCAA bid.\nWith no NCAA bid, Georgetown instead received an invitation to play in the 2002 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), but Esherick declined it. He explained his controversial decision by saying that Georgetowns home court, the MCI Center, was booked to host the East Regional of the 2002 NCAA Tournament, meaning that accepting the NIT invitation would have required the Hoyas to play on the road in the West for two weeks, forcing his players to miss many of their classes. After playing a similar schedule the previous season during the 2001 NCAA tournament, Esherick had concluded that missing so many classes to play in the NCAA Tournament would have been worth it because of the chance to win a national championship, but that missing them to play in the NIT, a tournament which did not offer a chance for a national championship, was not in the best interest of Georgetowns players. Georgetown became only the second team in history to turn down an NIT bid, and the first to do so since Louisville turned down an invitation to the 1987 NIT.\nThe 2001-02 team had a frustrating year, losing all three overtime games it played and three other games by only one point, and on five occasions it entered the final minute of a Big East game with a lead and lost. Eshericks decision to turn down the NIT bid made it the first Georgetown men's basketball team since the 1973-74 season to appear in neither the NCAA Tournament or the NIT.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n2001–02 Schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation Tournament\n!colspan=9 |"

        "text": "José Alfredo Valdez (born March 1, 1990) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the Generales de Durango of the Mexican League.

        "text": "Christian Jones (born February 18, 1991) is an American football linebacker who is a free agent. He was signed by the Bears as an undrafted free agent in 2014. He played college football at Florida State, and played for the Detroit Lions from 2018 to 2020.\nEarly years.\nJones attended Lake Howell High School in Winter Park, Florida. He recorded 326 tackles during his career. A five-star recruit, he was ranked as the second best outside linebacker in the country by Rivals.com.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman in 2010, Jones played in all 14 games, recording 18 tackles and three sacks. As a sophomore in 2011, he started all 13 games, recording 56 tackles and three sacks. As a junior in 2012, he started all 14 games and led the team in tackles with 95. He nearly entered the 2013 NFL Draft, but decided against it. As a senior in 2013, he was suspended one game for violation of team rules. He recorded 56 tackles with 7.5 tackles for a loss, one interception and two sacks.\nProfessional career.\nJones attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana and completed all of the combine and positional drills. On May 5, 2014, it was reported that Jones and his Florida State teammates Timmy Jernigan, and Telvin Smith had all failed drug tests at the NFL Combine. On March 18, 2014, Jones participated at Florida State's pro day and ran positional drills for scouts and team representatives. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Jones was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the ninth best outside linebacker prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com.\nChicago Bears.\nOn May 10, 2014, the Chicago Bears signed Jones to a three-year, $1.57 million undrafted free agent contract that includes a signing bonus of $5,000. Jones' fall in the draft was widely attributed to his failed drug test at the NFL combine. He also received an offer from the Jacksonville Jaguars, but chose the Bears partly due to the linebackers coach Reggie Herring.\n2014.\nThroughout training camp, Jones competed for a roster spot at linebacker against Khaseem Greene, Shea McClellin, Jordan Senn, Dede Lattimore, and Jerry Franklin. Head coach Marc Trestman named Jones the backup strongside linebacker to start the regular season, behind Shea McClellin.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Chicago Bears' season-opening 23–20 loss against the Buffalo Bills. The following week, Jones recorded his first career tackle on Bruce Ellington for a five-yard loss during a muffed punt return by Ellington in the second quarter of the Bears' 28–20 victory at the San Francisco 49ers in Week 2.

        "title": "2004–05 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2004–05 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2004–05 NCAA Division I college basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by John Thompson III – his first year at Georgetown – and played their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC. The Hoyas are members of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 19–13, 8–8 in Big East play. They advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2005 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Connecticut They played in the 2005 National Invitation Tournament and advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to South Carolina.\nSeason recap.\nJohn Thompson III, the son of legendary Georgetown head coach John Thompson, Jr., arrived from Princeton, where he had served as head coach for four seasons, as only the second person with prior head coaching experience to take over the Georgetowns mens basketball program. He made a decisive change in Georgetowns style of basketball. John Thompson, Jr., and his successor Craig Esherick had emphasized fast, running, very physical play over their combined 32 years as head coach at Georgetown, but, upon taking over the program from Esherick, John Thompson III introduced the \"Princeton offense\" he had learned as a player and assistant coach under Pete Carril at Princeton and had himself employed at Princeton during his four years as head coach there. The Princeton offense emphasizes ball movement, dribbling, passing, and backdoor cuts to set up more deliberate, and often more slowly developing, scoring opportunities.\nJunior forward and team co-captain Brandon Bowman started all 32 games – as he would all 127 games of his collegiate career. The Princeton offense suited him, and his scoring improved from his first two years with the team. Over the first four games of the season, he averaged 22 points, and he went on to lead the team in scoring in 15 games and in rebounding 13 times. He scored on a layup with eight seconds remaining in the game to give the Hoyas an upset win over 16th-ranked Pittsburgh on January 5, 2005, their only win over a ranked opponent during the season. Against seventh-ranked Syracuse 13 days later, he scored to tie the game and force overtime, narrowly missing winning the game with the shot when officials determined that his foot had been on the three-point line when he launched it and ruled it a two-pointer. In a game against Seton Hall on February 2, 2005, he scored 28 points and shot 14-for-15 (93.3%) from the free-throw line.\nThe change in the teams offensive philosophy also played to the strengths of junior guard and team co-captain Ashanti Cook, who started all 32 games, the second straight season he had started every game. He averaged 32 minutes a game and emerged as a leader on the floor, displaying expertise on defense and impressive shooting accuracy. He had his best offensive season as a Hoya, averaging 10.8 points a game and scoring in double figures 19 times. He shot 4-for-4 from three-point range and scored a career-high 23 points at Pittsburgh on January 5, 2005, and he again scored 23 points in the game against Seton Hall on February 2, 2005.\nSenior forward Darrel Owens started the first 12 games of the year, but then moved to the bench to make room for freshman center Roy Hibbert on the starting roster. Owens started only three more games during his collegiate career, and at first struggled in his new reserve role; during a nine-game stretch at midseason after coming out of the starting lineup, he shot only 28 percent from the field and averaged only one field goal per game. For his part, Hibbert started 17 games during the season, averaging 15.8 minutes, 5.1 points, and 3.5 rebounds per game. He had two double-doubles during the year and finished the season second on the team in blocked shots with 40. Against Notre Dame at the MCI Center on January 23, 2005, he scored on a game-winning slam-dunk to give the Hoyas a 55–54 win, and he went on to achieve what were then various career highs for him, including a 15-point game at Notre Dame, a 14-rebound game at Syracuse, a five-assist game against San Jose State, a three-steal game against West Virginia, and three blocked shots in four different games.\nFreshman guard Jonathan Wallace was another addition to the team. He started all 32 games and averaged 30.4 minutes, 6.5 points, 2.2 assists, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game. He had a season-high 20 points at Davidson, twice had six assists, had four steals against St. John's, and over the course of the year shot 78.8 percent in free throws.\nFreshman forward Jeff Green quickly emerged as a star of the team. He started all 32 games and averaged 33.8 minutes per game. In December 2004 he was selected to the Rainbow Classic All-Tournament Team. Over the course of the season he shot 50.2 percent from the field and had five double-doubles. He finished the year as the teams second-leading scorer, averaging 13.1 points per game overall and 13.4 in Big East play, and as its leader in rebounding with 6.6 per game, assists with 2.9 per game, and blocked shots with 1.6 per game. His season highs were 22 points against Connecticut on January 8, 2005, 12 rebounds at Villanova a week later, seven assists at Boston College on January 29, 2005, six blocked shots against Penn State, and four steals against Long Beach State.\nThe team lost its first game of the season, extending Georgetowns losing streak to 10 games dating back to the previous season, but then began to win, and it completed the non-conference portion of its schedule at 8–3. It then began Big East play, pushing its record to 16–6 overall and 8–3 in the conference before dropping its final five games to finish the regular season with a 16–11 overall record and 8–8 in the conference, good for a tie for seventh place in the Big East standings. The Hoyas beat Seton Hall in the first round of the 2005 Big East tournament with Darrel Owens emerging from his midseason slump to score 14 points against the Pirates, but lost to 12th-ranked Connecticut in the quarterfinals.\nWith a 17–12 record after the loss to Connecticut, Georgetown missed the NCAA tournament for the fourth straight year and seventh time in the previous eight years. However, the Hoyas returned to post-season tournament play for the first time since the 2002-03 season when they were invited to the 2005 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), their third invitation to and second appearance in the NIT in four years and sixth invitation to and fifth appearance in the NIT in eight years. Georgetown easily defeated Boston University at the MCI Center in the first round and had a 17-point win over Cal State Fullerton at McDonough Gymnasium in the second round in a game in which Ashanti Cook tied his career high with 10 rebounds. In the quarterfinals, Darrel Owens scored a career-high 26 points to push his per-game scoring average over the three NIT games to 18 points, but the Hoyas lost in a close game at eventual tournament champion South Carolina to finish the season with a record of 19–15.\nAfter the season, senior forward/guard Darrell Owens graduated and freshman forward Cornelio Guibunda left the team to transfer to American.\nThe 2004–2005 season saw the end of the annual series between Georgetown and Boston College that had begun in the 1958–1959 season. The longtime rivalry between the schools came to end with the departure of Boston College from the Big East at the end of the season to join the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 25 in either the AP Poll or the Coaches' Poll at any time.\n2004–05 Schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation Tournament"

        "text": "The 2013–14 Alabama State Hornets basketball team represented Alabama State University during the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hornets, led by ninth year head coach Lewis Jackson, played their home games at the Dunn–Oliver Acadome as members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. They finished the season 19–13, 12–6 in SWAC play to finish in a tie for second place. They advanced to the semifinals of the SWAC tournament where they lost to Texas Southern. They were invited to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament where they lost in the first round to Sam Houston State.\nSeason.\nPreseason.\nHead coach Lewis Jackson released the team's complete season schedule on September 27, 2013. Road games at Illinois and Bradley as part of the Global Sports Invitational, as well as participation in the Tulane Classic, highlighted the non-conference schedule. Per usual, the SWAC conference slate included one home game and one away game against each of the nine other members of the conference.\nNovember.\nOn November 8, the Hornets traveled to Champaign, Illinois to take on the Illinois Fighting Illini, a participant in the 2013 NCAA tournament. Jamel Waters scored 27 points, nearly half of the Hornets' total (63), but a weak defensive effort by Alabama State allowed the Illini to shoot 44% from the floor and attempt 30 free throws. The Hornets ultimately fell, 63–80. The Hornets continued their brief road trip on the 10th when they went south to Peoria, Illinois to play Missouri Valley Conference member Bradley. Waters led the Hornets again with 14 points, but another poor defensive effort allowed the Braves to shoot 59% from the field while limiting Alabama State to just 38%, leading to an 85–59 victory for Bradley.\nThe Hornets returned home to the Dunn–Oliver Acadome on November 13 to take on NAIA member Mobile. The Hornets got out to a quick lead that would never be relinquished as they dominated their lower-level foes throughout, en route to an 88–58 victory. The Hornets' next test was a road game against in-state foe Jacksonville State on November 16. The Hornets, who made 32 of 39 free throw attempts, were led by 16 points from Waters. The win increased Alabama State's record to 2–2, while dropping the Gamecocks to 0–4.\nAlabama State returned home to the Dunn–Oliver Acadome on November 18 to take on the Cougars of Chicago State. The Cougars defeated the Hornets, 54–67, in Chicago in 2012. Alabama State hit several clutch free throws with 55 seconds left to hold off a 7–0 run by the Cougars to gain the win, 79–75, on the strength of DeMarcus Robinson's 24 points.\nDecember.\nThe Hornets visited nearby Troy, Alabama, on December 7 for their rivalry match-up with Troy. While Robinson added a team-high 19 points, Troy had three 16+ point scorers and rolled to an easy 85–69 victory, revenge for the Hornets' victory in Montgomery in 2012. Alabama State made a quick pit-stop at home on December 16 with a home date against Western Illinois before heading off to the Tulane Classic. Waters had 15 points and six assists to lead the Hornets to a 59–52 win.\nSchedule and results.\nSource: \n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#000000; color:#FFD700;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#000000; color:#FFD700;\"| Non-conference games\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#000000; color:#FFD700;\"| Conference games\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#000000; color:#FFD700;\"| SWAC tournament\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#000000; color:#FFD700;\"| CIT"

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded by the critics as a notable achievement, and there have been only 71 instances of a bowler taking a five-wicket haul in World Cup tournaments. The Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is held once in every four years. In addition, players from four associate members of the ICC have taken five-wicket hauls in World Cups.\nStarting with the inaugural edition in 1975, a total of 59 players have taken five-wicket haul in the championship as of 2023. Australia's Dennis Lillee became the first player take a five-wicket haul when he took five wickets for 34 runs against Pakistan in the third match of the world cup. His compatriot Gary Gilmour picked up two consecutive five-wicket haulsin the semi-final against England and the final against West Indiesin the edition. The first of the two, six wickets for 14 runs, was named the \"Best Bowling Performance\" in ODIs in an all-time list released by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in 2002. Joel Garner is the only other player to take a five-wicket haul in a World Cup final. He took five wickets for 38 runs against England in the 1979 tournament final; the performance ensured West Indies' victory and helped them retain the title.\nThe 1992 edition was the only tournament where no five-wicket hauls were taken, while the 2003 tournament had a record 12 five-wicket hauls taken by 11 different players. Indian Mohammed Shami has taken four and Australia's Mitchell Starc has taken three five-wicket hauls while seven othersGilmour, Ashantha de Mel, Glenn McGrath, Vasbert Drakes, Shahid Afridi, Mustafizur Rahman, Shaheen Afridi have taken two in the history of the tournament.

        "text": "Tom Franklin (born 11 August 1990) is a New Zealand rugby union player who currently plays as a lock for in New Zealand's domestic National Provincial Championship competition and the in Super Rugby.\nEarly career.\nBorn in the small town of Ōpōtiki in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty Region, Franklin attended high school at St Paul's Collegiate School in Hamilton. After graduation, he turned down a scholarship at Lincoln University in Christchurch in favour of a move to Dunedin to study Business Management at the University of Otago. While working towards his degree, he began playing for Southern in the local Dunedin club rugby competition and also was a member of the Otago rugby academy.\nSenior career.\nFranklin first played provincial rugby with in 2011, debuting in a 30-14 win over , one of two appearances he made during the year. He was far more of a regular in 2012, playing 8 times and scoring his first provincial try for the Razorbacks as they came second in the ITM Cup Championship standings and reached the promotion playoff final before being thrashed 41-16 by Counties Manukau. He played 10 times in both the 2013 and 2014 seasons as Otago finished in 2nd and 6th place on the log respectively, still unable to gain promotion to the Premiership.\nAfter a poor year in 2014, the Razorbacks started to turn the corner in 2015, winning 6 of their 10 regular season matches they finished 3rd on the Championship log behind and before being defeated 34-14 by the Lions in the semi-finals. Franklin scored 1 try in 8 matches during the season and the following year added 3 more 5 pointers in 9 games as the men from Dunedin topped the Championship log and went on to reach the playoff final where they were surprisingly bettered by , going down 17-14 at home, a defeat which consigned them to yet another season of Championship rugby in 2017.\nSuper Rugby.\nSeveral seasons of solid performances at domestic level with Otago brought him to the attention of Dunedin-based Super Rugby franchise, the , who named him in their squad for the 2014 Super Rugby season. Competing for a starting slot against the likes of Joe Wheeler, Josh Bekhuis, Brad Thorn and Jarrad Hoeata, Franklin did well to feature in 8 games in his first season, starting 3 times and coming on as a replacement 5 times.\nThe Highlanders reached the quarter-finals in 2014 before being knocked out by the in Durban, but the following year they enjoyed a dream season and lifted the Super Rugby title for the first time in their history, defeating the 21-14 in the final. Franklin played in 15 of the Highlanders 19 games in 2015 and went on to play the same number of times in 2016 as they failed to hold on to their crown, losing to the in Johannesburg in the semi-finals.\nOn 5 April 2018, the announced that Franklin had signed a 2-year deal with Japanese club Kobelco Steelers. He came back for one more season with the Highlanders in 2019 and played a total of 85 games for the franchise.\nHowever, that wasn't the end of his Super Rugby career. On 11 January 2024, the Western Force announced the signing of Franklin for the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific season.\nInternational.\nFranklin was a member of the New Zealand Under-20 side which won the 2010 Junior World Championship in Argentina, playing 5 times.\nHe has also represented the Māori All Blacks, receiving his first call up to their squad ahead of the 2014 end-of-year rugby union internationals. He started both matches on their tour, victories over in Kobe and Tokyo, playing the full 80 minutes in a 61-21 win in the first test, before being yellow carded and then substituted by Hayden Triggs in a narrow 20-18 success in the second test.\nAfter a gap of 2 years, he was once again in a Māori shirt for the 2016 end-of-year rugby union internationals and played in the victories over the and Harlequins.\nFranklin was named as injury cover for Sam Whitelock in the All Blacks squad ahead of the 2016 mid-year rugby union internationals series against . Whitelock missed the first test but recovered enough to play in the remaining two matches so Franklin was withdrawn from the squad and is still awaiting his senior test debut. He was also part of the All Blacks squad named to train for the 2017 Rugby Championship.\nCareer Honours.\nNew Zealand Under-20\nHighlanders\nTaranaki"

        "text": "The 2002–03 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2002–03 NCAA Division I college basketball season. The Hoyas were coached by Craig Esherick and played their home games at the MCI Center in Washington, DC. The Hoyas were members of the West Division of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 19–15, 6–10 in Big East play. They advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2003 Big East men's basketball tournament before losing to Syracuse. After declining to participate in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) the previous season, they accepted an invitation to play in the 2003 NIT after failing to receive an NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament bid. Making Georgetown's fourth NIT appearance in six years, they became the second Georgetown mens basketball team in history to reach the NIT final and the first to do since the 1992-93 season, losing it to Big East rival St. John's.\nSeason recap.\nWith forward Harvey Thomas having transferred to Daytona Beach Community College over the offseason after his freshman year, the Hoyas began the season with only senior center Wesley Wilson and junior power forward Mike Sweetney returning from the previous season's frontcourt. Wilson opted to leave the team at midseason – although he remained in school and graduated on time in May 2003 – and as a result Sweetney, a team co-captain, carried the scoring load for the team during the year, responsible for a third of its offense. Starting all 34 games, he scored in double figures in all of them and had double-figure rebound performances 16 times, and he led the team in scoring 25 times and in rebounding in 29 games. His best performances were 38 points and 15 rebounds against Notre Dame, 32 points and 13 rebounds at Syracuse, 28 points and eight rebounds against Pittsburgh, and 31 points and 19 rebounds in a game at the MCI Center against Syracuse. He led the team in scoring in 13 of its final 15 games and in every one of its last seven games. For the season, he shot 54.7 percent from the field and 73.8 percent from the free-throw line. His average of 25.1 points per game was the second-highest in school history, behind only Allen Iverson, and his 776 points were the third highest in a single season in Georgetown history.\nJunior forward Gerald Riley started all 34 games, as he would all 125 games of his collegiate career. Opposing defenses focused on stopping Sweetney, giving Riley more scoring opportunities than he had had during his first two seasons. He took advantage of those opportunities, scoring in double figures 26 times, shooting 42.2 percent overall from the field, 42.7 percent in two-pointers, and 41.5 percent from three-point range. In free throws, he shot 84.3 percent, including a perfect 43-for-43 from the line in 14 games combined, and he missed only a combined seven free throws in 16 Big East games.\nFreshman forward Brandon Bowman joined the team this season and started all 34 games, averaging 24 minutes, 7.6 points, and 4.5 rebounds per game. He shot 95-for-248 (38.3%) from the field, but only 10-for-55 (18.2%) from three-point range and only 3-for-19 (15.8%) in three-pointers during Big East games. His scoring improved as the season wore on, however, and he finished fourth in scoring on the team.\nFreshman guard Ashanti Cook, a high-school teammate of Bowmans, was another newcomer to the team. He was averaging 8.2 points per game and showing great promise when he suffered an ankle injury in the game against top-ranked Duke on January 8, 2003. The injury cost him a month of play, and when he returned to action it hobbled him for another month, and he scored a total of only 20 points over the final nine weeks of the regular season. Also debuting with the varsity team was sophomore forward Darrel Owens, who had sat out his freshman year in 2001–02. He saw limited time during the season, although he played in 32 of the 34 games and started one of them. His 11-point, four-rebound game at Duke was his best effort.\nThe team opened the season 7–0, but went 7-13 the rest of the way to finish the regular season with a 14-13 overall record, 6–10 in the Big East, and a fifth-place finish in the conferences West Division. In the 2003 Big East tournament, the Hoyas defeated Villanova in the first round. In the quarterfinals, they lost to Syracuse despite an 18-point game by Bowman.\nThe teams Big East tournament result left it with a 15-14 overall record, and it missed the NCAA tournament for the fifth time in six years. Instead, it received an invitation to the 2003 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), its fifth NIT invitation and fourth NIT appearance in the previous six years. Cook finally began to return to form, scoring a season-high 16 points at Tennessee in the first round of the NIT, and Bowman shot 10-for-18 (55.6%) from the field in two NIT games. The Hoyas defeated Tennessee, then won at Providence and at North Carolina to advance to the semifinals at Madison Square Garden in New York City, their deepest run in a postseason tournament since they advanced to the East Region final in the 1996 NCAA tournament. In the semifinals they defeated Minnesota – the team that had beaten them in the final game of the 1993 NIT – and advanced to the second NIT final in school history and first since 1993. As in 1993, they lost the final, succumbing to Big East rival St. John's, although the NCAA later vacated the 2003 NIT title when it was discovered that St. John's had used an ineligible player.\nAt the end of the season, Georgetown extended head coach Craig Esherick′s contract through 2009. However, he was destined to last only one more season with the team.\nIn June 2003, Mike Sweetney opted to forgo his senior year of college eligibility and enter the NBA draft, the third player – after Allen Iverson in 1996 and Victor Page in 1997 – to break with the John Thompson, Jr.-Craig Esherick era's tradition of basketball players staying a full four years and graduating.\nThis was the last of three seasons in which Georgetown played as a member of the Big Easts West Division. For the following season, the Big East scrapped its divisions and returned to a unified structure.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nThe team was not ranked in the Top 25 in either the AP Poll or the Coaches' Poll at any time, but was among other teams receiving votes in both polls during some weeks.\n2002–03 Schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Preseason\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| National Invitation Tournament"

Starting with the 1996 tournament, specific championships are often referred to in the form \"Euro 2008\" or whichever year is appropriate.\nPrior to entering the tournament all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process.\nFrance is one of the most successful nations at the European Championship, having won two titles in 1984 and 2000, and finishing as runners-up in 2016. The team is just below Spain and Germany, who have won three titles each. France hosted the inaugural competition in 1960 and have appeared in ten tournaments (with an upcoming eleventh appearance in 2024), tied for fourth-best. The team won their first title on home soil in 1984 and were led by Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini. In 2000, the team, led by FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, won its second title in Belgium and the Netherlands. The team's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1992 and 2008."

In 1965, Mike McNulty died at Studio City Convalescent Hospital in Studio City, California at the age of 78.\n\"\"Modern fighters don't know what road work is. Their idea now is 10 or 15 minutes. Phooey! Why I remember when old timers like Tommy Gibbons, Mike O'Dowd and Billy Miske used to run for hours in any kind of weather to strengthen their underpinning and lungs. They would get up early in the morning and ride the street car as far out of St. Paul as they could and then they'd run every step of the way back to the gym. And listen cold weather never bothered those men. On the zero days they'd put on enough clothes to sag these modern fighters to the ground and lug that extra weigh all the way home. Those men were great fighters and were always in condition and long lived in the game. Being in condition and staying that way means everything. These present day boxers - phooey.\"- Mike McNulty on July 30, 1935\"\nMike O’Dowd.\nIn 1913, St. Paul, Minnesota's own Mike O’Dowd turned professional under Mike McNulty, whose subsequent training and management of O’Dowd molded him into the undisputed World Middleweight Boxing Champion by 1917. O’Dowd continued to hold this title against all comers (including against Harry Greb, Al McCoy, Kid Lewis and Mike Gibbons to name a few) until 1920 when he lost it to Johnny Wilson on a hotly disputed decision.\nJohnny Ertel.\nMike McNulty, manager and trainer of Johnny Ertel from his first professional match in 1913 at age 16, was in “Kewpie” or “Little Dynamo” Ertel's corner in St. Paul, Minnesota on September 10, 1915 when Ertel fought Kid Williams and won the World Championship Bantamweight boxing title from the “Kid”. It is reported that after later moving away from McNulty's training and management, Johnny Ertel was not the same fighter.\nSee also.\nJack Dempsey vs. Tommy Gibbons"

The Pioneer is the shortest of the courses, playing to a par 71. As the name implies, The Pioneer was the first course built at the complex in 1968. The Pioneer course is 5,880 yards with a rating of 68.4, and a slope of 115. It is like most mid-western courses, slightly sloping on the front nine with increasing slopes on the back. The Willows, designed by Dr. Michael Hurdzan, offers golfers a scenic and challenging test of tree-lined fairways and undulating greens. The Willows course plays to 6,697 yards from the championship tees and is rated 9th among Kentucky courses. It has a par of 72, the course rating is 72.6 and the slope is 137. Power carts are optional, and are permitted to cross at 90 degrees to the direction of play. Fox Run, designed by renowned architect Arthur Hills, is a distinctively different golf course which provides various blends of architectural style from hole to hole. On this nine are holes which somewhat resemble those of a typical Scottish golf course. There are Carolina type holes with drastic changes in elevation from tee to green. There are also more traditional mid-western style golf holes. There is an absence of housing and condo development within the course complex. This course is consistently rated one of the most challenging public courses in the State of Kentucky.\nKenton County Golf Course also has a driving range and a clubhouse with a pro-shop, a bar, and a wide variety of food on offer.\nBilly Casper Golf was named as the new management company for all three golf courses in December 2019 "

Listed at and , he both bats and throws right-handed.\nAmateur career.\nSmith attended Midland Christian High School in Midland, Texas. He then enrolled at Grayson County College, where he began his college baseball career. After Smith's freshman year, he transferred to Texas State University, where he played for the Texas State Bobcats baseball team. He was named Southland Conference Pitcher of the Year as a sophomore and a junior, and a second team All-American by Louisville Slugger as a junior.\nProfessional career.\nMinor League Baseball.\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Smith in the eighth round of the 2011 MLB Draft, with the 243rd overall pick. Smith pitched for the High Desert Mavericks of the Class A-Advanced California League in 2012, and the Jackson Generals of the Double-A Southern League in 2013. After the 2013 season, the Mariners assigned Smith to the Arizona Fall League, and he was named to appear in the Fall Stars Game. In 2014, Smith pitched for the Tacoma Rainiers of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.\nSeattle Mariners (2014–2015).\nThe Mariners promoted Smith to the major leagues on September 1, 2014. He faced one batter that day, retiring Josh Donaldson of the Oakland Athletics on a ground out. Smith made a total of nine appearances for the Mariners in September; he did not allow a run in innings pitched, while recording ten strikeouts and issuing three walks.\nPitching for Seattle in 2015, Smith did not allow a run in his first 11 appearances of the season. This set a Mariners' record of 20 pitching appearances without allowing a run to start an MLB career. Smith finally allowed a run on May 3, his 21st MLB appearance, giving up a solo home run to Evan Gattis of the Houston Astros. Smith became the Mariners' closer in June due to Fernando Rodney's struggles during the season. For the season, Smith appeared in 70 Mariners games, compiling a 2.31 earned run average (ERA) while recording 13 saves; in 70 innings pitched, he had 92 strikeouts and issued 22 walks.\nBoston Red Sox (2016–2018).\nOn December 7, 2015, the Mariners traded Smith and Roenis Elías to the Boston Red Sox for Wade Miley and Jonathan Aro.\nOn March 22, 2016, while pitching in spring training against the Miami Marlins, Smith was removed from the game after throwing five pitches during the 7th inning due to tightness in his right forearm. He was diagnosed with a flexor mass muscle strain after undergoing an MRI scan. Smith made three appearances for the Red Sox during the regular season, pitching scoreless innings in May while striking out two and walking one before landing back on the disabled list on May 20 with an elbow injury. He then underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his season. His return was not expected until June 2017.\nAfter more than a year recovering from surgery, Smith was sent on rehabilitation assignments in August 2017 with the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs and Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. He was then activated from the 60-day disabled list on September 5, 2017. He appeared in eight regular season games for Boston during September, giving up one run in innings pitched (1.35 ERA) while striking out seven and walking two. On September 18, 2017, Smith picked up his only save as a member of the Red Sox during an extra inning victory over the Orioles. \nSmith was included on Boston's postseason roster for the 2017 American League Division Series. He made two appearances during the series, pitching innings of scoreless relief, striking out one and walking two, as Boston lost to the eventual World Series champions, the Houston Astros.\nSmith entered the 2018 season as a member of the Red Sox' bullpen. On May 15, he was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right shoulder subluxation. The injury occurred when Smith, in reaction to allowing a home run to Khris Davis of the Oakland Athletics in the prior day's game, threw his glove in the dugout out of frustration. Prior to being placed on the disabled list, Smith had made 18 appearances with a 1–1 record and 3.77 ERA. On June 12, it was revealed that Smith would require surgery for his shoulder injury, likely putting him out of action for the remainder of the year. The procedure was performed on June 13. The Red Sox outrighted him to the minors on November 1, 2018, and he chose to become a free agent.\nOn December 30, 2018, Smith re-signed to a minor league deal with the Red Sox. He began with 2019 season on the injured list of Triple-A Pawtucket. Smith was released on June 18, 2019, without appearing in a game due to his ongoing recovery from shoulder surgery."

        "title": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Samuel Hunter Bennett (born June 20, 1996) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Bennett was rated by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the top North American prospect for the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, where he was selected fourth overall by the Calgary Flames. Bennett made his NHL debut in the 2014–15 season.\nPlaying career.\nKingston Frontenacs.\nBennett is a native of Holland Landing, Ontario. He played minor ice hockey for the York-Simcoe Express and then the Toronto Marlboros. He played in the 2009 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament as a member of York-Simcoe, and was a teammate of Connor McDavid. In 2012, he was selected ninth overall by the Kingston Frontenacs in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection Draft. He appeared in 40 games with the Frontenacs in 2012–13 and recorded 40 points to earn a place on the OHL's Second All-Rookie Team.\nReturning to the Frontenacs for the 2013–14 season, Bennett was among the OHL's scoring leaders by mid-season. He stood fourth with 66 points in 40 games and was on a 24-game scoring streak when he suffered a minor injury that prevented him from participating in the 2014 CHL Top Prospects Game. In its mid-season ranking, the NHL Central Scouting Bureau named Bennett as the top North American prospect for the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. One of the Bureau's scouts praised Bennett's offensive ability: \"His puckhandling and playmaking are excellent and he has one of the best shots in this year's draft class. He has scored several goals from the high slot and coming in off the wing and has been very effective on the power play.\" Concerns were raised when at the 2014 NHL Scouting Combine, he was unable to do a single pull-up. He retained the top spot in NHL Central Scouting's final ranking after recording nine points in seven playoff games for Kingston despite playing through a groin injury. He finished the regular season with 36 goals and 91 points in 57 games. He was named to the OHL's Third All-Star Team.\nThe Calgary Flames selected Bennett with the fourth overall selection at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, and he quickly signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the club. He attended the team's training camp prior to the 2014–15 season, where he injured his shoulder. Bennett admitted that the shoulder had ailed him the previous season in Kingston, but he initially failed to disclose the issue, stating he \"wanted to play\" and would \"do anything to make the team and play in the NHL this year\". Instead, Bennett's injury required surgery to repair, which the Flames said would prevent him from playing for several months. After missing five months of action, Bennett was medically cleared to play and was reassigned to Kingston on February 21, 2015. He scored 24 points in 11 regular season games for Kingston and added 3 assists as the Frontenacs were quickly eliminated in the OHL playoffs.\nCalgary Flames.\nThe Flames recalled Bennett to Calgary after Kingston's season ended, and he made his NHL debut in the team's final regular season game on April 12, against the Winnipeg Jets. He recorded his first career point on his first shift – 33 seconds into the contest – assisting on a Micheal Ferland goal in a 5–1 loss. Bennett was a regular player for the Flames in the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, and recorded his first NHL goal on April 19, a game-winner against Eddie Läck of the Vancouver Canucks in a 4–2 victory. Bennett played all 11 playoff games for the Flames, in which he scored three goals and added an assist. On January 13, 2016, Bennett scored four goals against the Florida Panthers. At 19 years and six months, he became the youngest player in Flames history to score a hat-trick, and the third-youngest player in NHL history to score four goals in a game. Bennett scored his first three goals within the first 17 minutes of the game, and added a fourth goal in the last minute of the third period.\nOn September 6, 2017, the Flames signed Bennett to a two-year, $3.9 million contract extension worth $1.95 million annually. On July 24, 2019, Bennett was re-signed to a two-year contract.\nFlorida Panthers.\nOn April 12, 2021, Bennett, along with a sixth-round pick in 2022, was traded to the Florida Panthers in exchange for draft rights to Emil Heineman and a second-round pick in 2022.\nOn July 26, 2021, Bennett signed a four-year, $17.6 million contract extension with the Panthers.\nInternational play.\nBennett played for the Canadian under-18 national team in the 2013 World U18 Championship. He recorded three goals and four assists in seven games as Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 victory over the United States in the final. He also played on the gold medal-winning Canadian team at the 2013 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament."

He played college football at Oregon State and was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round, 72nd overall of the 2014 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nCrichton was born in Tacoma, Washington to immigrant parents from Samoa. Crichton attended Henry Foss High School, where he was a three-year letterman at defensive end and linebacker, but also played some tight end. He was named the Narrows League Defensive MVP after collecting 78 solo tackles as a senior.

        "text": "Major League Baseball on DuMont refers to the now defunct DuMont Television Network's coverage of Major League Baseball. More specifically, DuMont broadcast the World Series (during its very early years as a televised event) from 1947-1949.\nWorld Series coverage.\nGillette, which produced World Series telecasts from roughly 1947-1965 (before 1966, local announcers, who were chosen by the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball, and NBC television, exclusively called the World Series), paid for airtime on DuMont's owned-and-operated Pittsburgh affiliate, WDTV (now KDKA-TV) to air the World Series. In the meantime, Gillette also bought airtime on ABC, CBS, and NBC. More to the point, in some cities, the World Series was broadcast on three different stations at once. For example, the 1947 World Series (for which DuMont only televised Games 2, 6–7 with Bill Slater on the call) was only seen in four markets via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Schenectady, New York; Washington, District of Columbia; and, environs surrounding these cities. Outside of New York, coverage was pooled.\nFor the World Series, games in Boston were only seen in the Northeast. Meanwhile, games in Cleveland were only seen in the Midwest and Pittsburgh. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation. In all, the 1948 World Series was televised to fans in seven Midwestern cities: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Toledo. By , World Series games could now be seen east of the Mississippi River. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.\nAttempts at creating a regular season national package.\nBy the start of the 1950s, Major League Baseball was, for the most part, still in the province of the local market television stations. Outside of these markets, however, televised baseball (unlike on radio) was rare. DuMont's sports programming head, Thomas McMahon was working with individual owners to televise Major League Baseball's first regular season national games in the summer of 1953.\nMcMahon planned (as far back as January 1953) to set up a corporation to sell the national MLB telecasts meanwhile, giving stock shares to minor league teams. More specifically, McMahon's plan was to negotiate with individual teams rather than Major League Baseball as a whole. This way, McMahon could avoid a potential antitrust suit from the Department of Justice. In order to counter the possible negative effect on the minors (which Western League president Edwin C. Johnson most predominately feared), McMahon would offer them a piece of the national television pie. Furthermore, McMahan argued that since the planned DuMont games would be held on Saturday afternoons, the minors that scheduled most of their games in the evening wouldn't have been greatly affected.\nUltimately, however, the first national \"Game of the Week\" package didn't air on DuMont, but on ABC. In April 1953, ABC set out to sell teams rights but instead, only got the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox to sign on. To make matters worse, Major League Baseball barred the \"Game of the Week\" from airing within 50 miles of any ballpark.\nMajor League Baseball on DuMont's affiliates.\nDuMont's owned-and-operated stations are highlighted in yellow. The Paramount owned-and-operated stations, which did not carry DuMont programs but were ruled DuMont O&amp;Os by the FCC, are shown in pink. Franchises that were later relocated are listed in \"italics\"."

        "text": "Aesthetic group gymnastics (AGG) is a discipline of gymnastics developed from Finnish \"Women's Gymnastics\" (naisvoimistelu). The discipline is reminiscent of rhythmic gymnastics, with some significant differences: in AGG, the emphasis is on big and continuous body movement, and the teams are larger. AGG teams often consist of 6–10 gymnasts, and some children’s teams are bigger. Furthermore, apparatus is not used in international AGG competitions as it is in rhythmic gymnastics where balls, ribbons, hoops and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized in the flow and, expressive and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves and swings, balances and pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts.\nThe length of the competition program should be 2.15 – 2.45 minutes. The competition dress of a group must be a leotard with aesthetic appeal considering the spirit of competitive sport. The size of the competition area, which is a gymnastics carpet, is 13 m × 13 m.\nThe International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003. The Federation has amongst others Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Russia, Ukraine and Spain as members.\nAge categories.\nIn AGG, the teams compete in the following age categories:\nIn addition, there is a University students category where the gymnasts should be 17 years and over. It is only junior and senior gymnasts that compete in A-category international competitions, such as the World Championships.\nJudging.\nThe jury is composed of three judge panels: \nThe technical jury will assess whether the program has all the required technical elements, which in AGG depends on the age group of the gymnasts, but which generally consists of:\nThe artistic jury evaluates the gymnasts’ quality, the structure of the composition, and the originality and expression of the composition. \nThe executive jury makes deductions for mistakes they identify during the program. E.g., insufficient extensions, unfixed shapes in body movements, heavy landings in jumps, unfixed shapes in balances,lack of synchronization and even the smallest mistakes as not pointing your feet. \nThe highest total score is 20.00 points consisting of: Technical Value (TV) 6.0, Artistic Value (AV) 4.0, and Execution (EXE) 10.0.\nAesthetic Group Gymnastics World Championships.\nThe international competition system for AGG is organized into three categories. These are designated as A, B, and C. The A-category competitions include the World Championships, the Continental Championships, the World Cup competitions, the Challenge Cup competitions (for juniors), IFAGG Championships, and other approved championships. The B-category competitions include international children's or junior competitions. The C-category is reserved for national championships.\nAesthetic Group Gymnastics is a discipline not currently recognized by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique. World Championships are organized annually since 2000 by the International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAAG).\nAesthetic Group Gymnastics European Championships.\nEuropean Championships are organized annually since 2016 by the International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAAG). Since 2018, they are held on every two years.\nAesthetic Group Gymnastics World Cup.\nWorld Cup is a series of competitions that are held throughout the year in the world. The World Cup series consists of four seasonal competitions held in different countries. There are two types, which are organised at the same time – World Cup is for senior teams and Challenge Cup is for junior teams. Teams receive points from each stage and best three results give the final ranking in World Cup series.\nThe winner of the first ever IFAGG World Cup, held in 2005, was SC Oscar from Russia, GC Piruett from Estonia was second and VVS Frida from Finland third.\nIn Finland.\nAGG is a very popular sports among girls in Finland. The Finnish Gymnastics Federation is one of Finland's largest sport federations with 374 clubs consisting of approximately 130,000 members. The most popular gymnastics discipline in the country is AGG.\nThe Finnish teams have won many the world championships and have recently got second place in the world championships\nSome popular companies that do the sport in Finland are: Vantaan voimisteluseura (VVS), Olarin voimisteliat (OVO), Attitude Sports, ScVantaa, and kirkkonummen urheiliat (kirku).\nIn Finland, the AGG follows the rules of the Finnish Gymnastics Federation. It is possible to compete on three different levels or series in AGG: the championship level, the competition level, and the hobby level. The championship series is the most high-level series, as teams in this series compete in the Finnish Championships. The teams can decide themselves in which series they want to compete but the Finnish Gymnastics Federation has put out recommendations that they prefer to be followed. Children younger than 12 years old all compete in the same series.\nAccording to the rules of the Finnish Gymnastics Federation, in the spring teams compete with programs without apparatus and on the fall with programs including apparatus, which is dependent on the age category. Juniors and seniors in the championship series do not compete with apparatus. In the autumn competitions, the apparatus are the following:\nThe points are given in categories from 1 to 10 in the age categories of 10–12 and 12–14 (competition and hobby series).

        "text": "The 2013 Survivor Series was the 27th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on November 24, 2013, at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Eight matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show.\nThe main event saw Randy Orton defeat Big Show to retain the WWE Championship. In other prominent matches, John Cena defeated Alberto Del Rio to retain the World Heavyweight Championship and CM Punk and Daniel Bryan defeated The Wyatt Family's Luke Harper and Erick Rowan.\nThe pay-per-view was the worst-selling edition of Survivor Series since the event's inception in 1987; this was attributed to a weak buildup. It received 179,000 buys, down from 212,000 for the previous year's event; and attracted more than 100,000 fewer orders than the 2011 event, which generated 281,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2013 event was the 27th Survivor Series and was scheduled to be held on November 24, 2013, at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Tickets went on sale on September 7 via Ticketmaster.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nThe main feud heading into Survivor Series featured Randy Orton and Big Show over the former's WWE Championship. Since returning from an injury in mid-August, Big Show had been speaking out against COO and the on-screen regime of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon and their mistreatment of several Superstars, especially Daniel Bryan. This put him at odds with \"The Authority\", and as a result, Big Show was continuously humiliated by Triple H and McMahon throughout September, and was obliged to knock out several other rebellious wrestlers, owing to a threat of being fired. At Battleground on October 6, Big Show interfered in a match between Orton and Bryan for the vacant WWE Championship, and knocked both competitors out, ruling out the match a no contest. The next night on \"Raw\", he was fired from WWE by McMahon in storyline, but returned later that night to knock out Triple H in defiance. Big Show continued to \"illegally\" appear over the next several weeks on \"Raw\", assisting Bryan, knocking out \"Raw\" general manager Brad Maddox, and costing The Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns their WWE Tag Team Championship. On the October 21 episode of \"Raw\", Big Show announced he was filing a lawsuit against WWE for wrongful termination from his contract, and two weeks later won an \"out-of-court negotiation\" with Triple H and Stephanie over his lawsuit, and was rehired by WWE on the condition he promised not to sue them further and received a match against Orton for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series.\nThe event included two traditional Survivor Series elimination matches, the first of which saw the five-man team of The Shield (United States Champion Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) and The Real Americans (Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger with manager Zeb Colter) face off against WWE Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Goldust, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and Rey Mysterio, who made a surprise return on the November 18 episode of \"Raw\". The second elimination match pitted Natalya, The Bella Twins (Nikki Bella and Brie Bella), The Funkadactyls (Naomi and Cameron), Eva Marie, and JoJo against Divas Champion AJ Lee, Tamina Snuka, Kaitlyn, Alicia Fox, Rosa Mendes, Aksana, and Summer Rae. This match stems from AJ insulting Natalya and the rest for taking part in the \"Total Divas\" reality show.\nThe other world title in the company was also on the line at Survivor Series, as John Cena defended his World Heavyweight Championship against Alberto Del Rio. After suffering an elbow injury in August, Cena was to be sidelined from action for a minimum of four months. Despite this, SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero surprised then-World Heavyweight Champion Del Rio on the October 7 episode of \"Raw\", by naming Cena as his opponent at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. At the event, Cena defeated Del Rio to win his third World Heavyweight title, and his fourteenth World title overall. A rematch between the pair was announced for Survivor Series in early November.\nAnother major rivalry pitted CM Punk and Daniel Bryan against The Wyatt Family, an enigmatic backwoods cult composed of Luke Harper and Erick Rowan, led by the faction's namesake, Bray Wyatt. Since their debut in July, The Wyatt Family had been targeting and attacking several wrestlers, including Kane, Kofi Kingston, and The Miz, all in cause of Bray Wyatt exalting his character's preachings and ideals. On the October 28 episode of \"Raw\", the Wyatt Family attacked Bryan backstage, and later attacked Punk in the ring. With Punk and Bryan aiding each other and showing resistance, their altercations with The Wyatts continued over the next several weeks on \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", until an official match between the teams was announced for Survivor Series.\nAlso confirmed prior to the event was a match between Kofi Kingston and The Miz for the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show. On the November 18 episode of \"Raw\", during a match with The Real Americans (Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger), The Miz turned against his tag team partner, Kofi Kingston, and walked out of the match. This action allowed Swagger to apply the Ankle Lock on Kingston which he tapped out of giving the win to the Real Americans.\nAlso on the November 18 episode of \"Raw\", Big E Langston defeated Curtis Axel to win the Intercontinental Championship, and a rematch was later confirmed for the pay-per-view.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThe Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show included the panel of Josh Mathews, Bret Hart, Booker T, and Mick Foley previewing the matches. Also on the pre-show, The Miz defeated Kofi Kingston after a Roll-up.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view began with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon coming to the stage, with the two declaring they were allowing no interference in any match tonight.\nIn the first match, Cody Rhodes, Goldust, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and Rey Mysterio faced The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) and The Real Americans (Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger) in a traditional Survivor Series elimination match. Ambrose was eliminated by Rhodes with a roll up. Swagger was eliminated by Jey after a 619 by Mysterio, a Superkick by Jimmy and a Samoan Splash by Jey. Cesaro was eliminated by Rhodes with a roll up. Jimmy was eliminated by Reigns after a Spear. Rhodes was eliminated by Reigns after a Spear. Jey was eliminated by Rollins after a Curb Stomp. Rollins was eliminated by Mysterio with a Roll Up. Goldust was eliminated by Reigns after a Spear. Mysterio was eliminated by Reigns after a Spear, leaving Reigns as the sole survivor.\nNext, Big E Langston defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Curtis Axel. Big E pinned Axel after a \"Big Ending\" to retain the title.\nAfter that, Team Total Divas (Natalya, Nikki Bella, Brie Bella, Cameron, Naomi, JoJo, and Eva Marie) faced Team True Divas (Divas Champion AJ Lee, Tamina Snuka, Kaitlyn, Alicia Fox, Aksana, Rosa Mendes, and Summer Rae) in a traditional Survivor Series elimination match. Fox was eliminated by Naomi after a Split-Legged Moonsault. Cameron was eliminated by Mendes after Mendes tripped Cameron into a Turnbuckle. Mendes was eliminated by Nikki after a Bella Buster. Rae was eliminated by Nikki after a Running Single Leg Dropkick. Marie was eliminated by Kaitlyn after a Fireman's Carry Gutbuster. Naomi was eliminated by Kaitlyn after a Fireman's Carry Gutbuster. Kaitlyn was eliminated by Brie after a Missile Dropkick. Brie was eliminated by Aksana after a Divo Drop. Aksana was eliminated by Nikki after a Rack Attack. JoJo was eliminated by AJ after a Samoan Drop by Tamina. Tamina was eliminated by Natalya after submitting to the Sharpshooter. AJ was eliminated by Natalya after submitting to the Sharpshooter, leaving Natalya and Nikki as the survivors. Despite this, it was announced that Natalya was the sole survivor after commentator JBL said that Nikki had been eliminated.\nRyback came to the ring issuing an open-challenge, with Mark Henry answering the challenge. Henry pinned Ryback after a World's Strongest Slam to win the match.\nIn the fifth match, John Cena defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Alberto Del Rio. During the match, Cena attempted a Five Knuckle Shuffle on Del Rio but Del Rio performed a DDT on Cena for a near-fall. Cena attempted an Attitude Adjustment on Del Rio but Del Rio countered the move and performed a Bridging German Suplex on Cena for a near-fall. The match ended when Del Rio applied the Cross Armbreaker on Cena but Cena escaped the hold and pinned Del Rio after an Attitude Adjustment to retain the title.\nAfter that, CM Punk and Daniel Bryan faced Luke Harper and Erick Rowan. During the match, Punk and Bryan performed a double Belly to Back Suplex on Rowan for a near-fall. Punk and Bryan performed a Hart Attack on Harper for a nearfall. Rowan performed a Running Splash on Bryan for a nearfall. Punk performed a Diving Elbow Drop on Harper for a nearfall. In the end, Bryan performed a Running Knee on Rowan and Punk pinned Harper after a GTS to win the match.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Randy Orton defended the WWE Championship against Big Show. During the match, Orton attempted an RKO but Big Show countered and performed a Chokeslam on Orton for a nearfall. After the referee was knocked down, Big Show performed a KO Punch on Orton. The Authority distracted Big Show, allowing Orton to perform an RKO on Big Show. Orton pinned Big Show after a Punt Kick to retain the title. After the match, John Cena confronted Orton. Cena raised the World Heavyweight Championship whilst Orton raised the WWE Championship as the event ended.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", WWE Champion Randy Orton came out to talk to The Authority (Triple H and Stephanie McMahon) about causing a distraction in his title defense against Big Show when he was interrupted by World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, who proposed a match against Orton to unify both world titles to determine the undisputed WWE world champion. Triple H agreed and made it a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match at . Orton won the match and became the first WWE World Heavyweight Champion, which kept the lineage of the WWE Championship while the World Heavyweight Championship was retired.\nAlso later that night, The Shield (United States Champion Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) faced three members of the opposing survivor series team members in Rey Mysterio and the WWE Tag Team Champions The Rhodes Brothers and were victorious after Ambrose pinned Cody Rhodes. Later that night, The Shield attacked CM Punk after Punk and Daniel Bryan won a match by disqualification against all three members of The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, and Erick Rowan), who would drag Bryan off before Punk was attacked by The Shield. As a result, two 3-on-1 handicap matches were set at TLC. Punk defeated The Shield while Bryan lost to The Wyatt Family.\nOn the December 2 episode of \"Raw\", Natalya pinned AJ Lee, to secure a victory for her team in a six-Diva tag team match. After this string of non-title wins, Natalya was officially announced to challenge Lee for the Divas Championship at the TLC event.\nAnother rematch was the 7-on-7 Divas Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team match would happen.\nThe 2013 Survivor Series was the last Survivor Series to include the World Heavyweight Championship, as at the following month's TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs event, the title was unified with the WWE Championship, which was renamed to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship."

World Cup Park is made up of five parks: Pyeonghwa (Peace) Park, Haneul (Sky) Park, Noeul (Sunset) Park, Nanjicheon Park, and Hangang Riverside Park.\nHistory.\nNanjido.\nIn late 1970s, a small islet in the northwest part of Seoul, called Nanjido, was made into a landfill due to the waste disposal problem that arose, due to the rapid development of Seoul into a metropolitan city. The park was once a 15-year-old landfill that consisted with 92 million tons of garbage, and it took 6 years to stabilize, and an extra year to build the park. The 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup Games led to the rebirth of Nanjido as an eco-friendly area.\nNanjido was developed by Nanji which is a branch of Hangang parting from the main river around Mangwonjeong and then rejoins the river near Haengjusansung(Hill Fortress). This place was used a dock for boating till the late Joseon period.\nBefore 1978 when the place was used as a landfill, peanuts and millet were cultivated on this land.\nFive Parks.\nPyeonghwa (Peace) Park.\nLocated on the opposite side of Seoul World Cup Stadium, it is the main park of World Cup Park created to commemorate the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup Games. Its name was given to symbolize world peace and unity. There is UNICEF Plaza, Nanji Pond, Peace Park, Hope Forest, and the World Cup Park Museum.\nHaneul Park.\nLike its name Haneul, which means sky in Korean, the park is situated at World Cup Park's highest point. The Haneul stairs consist of 291 stairs and have become a tourist attraction. Situated at the highest point in World Cup Park, there are observation points on the sloping sides of the park.\nNoeul Park.\nThe park contains wild animals such as deer, wildcats and raccoons. There is a sculpture park which is a themed space with nature and cultural art works displayed on green lawns.\nNanjicheon Park.\nNanjicheon Park was built along the Nanji Stream, which flowed under the Haneul Park. The stream was filled with sewage but it is now purified. It has an outdoor stage and various sports facilities.\nHangang Riverside Park (Nanji Area).\nHangang Riverside Park was built on the banks of Han River (Korea). It has soccer field, basketball court, grass field, River cruise ship port, and an area for nature-studies."

In its eighth year under head coach Vic Heyliger, the team compiled a 22–4–0 record, outscored opponents 161 to 70, and won the 1952 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The season was the second consecutive in which the Michigan hockey team won the NCAA championship.\nIndividual accomplishments.\nSenior defenseman Bob Heathcott from Turner Valley, Alberta was Michigan's leading scorer during the 1951–52 season with 44 points on 13 goals and 31 assists. Six members of the team were selected as first-team All-Americans: forwards George Chin, Earl Keyes, John McKennell, and Doug Philpott, and defensemen Jim Haas and Reg Shave.\nAt the end of the season, the players selected goalie Willard Ikola from Eveleth, Minnesota, as the team's most valuable player.

In its ninth year under head coach Vic Heyliger, the team compiled a 17–7–0 record, outscored opponents 139 to 71, and won the 1953 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The season was the third consecutive, and the fourth overall under Vic Heyliger, in which the Michigan hockey team won the NCAA championship. The team also finished the regular season in at tie with Minnesota as the co-champion of the Midwest Collegiate Hockey League.\nIndividual accomplishments.\nTeam captain John Matchefts, a senior from Eveleth, Minnesota, was the leading scorer with 48 points on 18 goals and 30 assists. Michigan left wing Johnny McKennell, a senior from Toronto, was suspended for the remainder of the season after he allegedly punched referee Milo Yalich in Denver, Colorado, following a 5–4 overtime loss to the Denver Pioneers on December 23, 1952. McKennell was accused of slugging Yalich three times while disputing Denver's game-winning overtime goal. Athletic director Fritz Crisler announced the suspension after receiving a notarized report from the president of the Rocky Mountain Hockey Officials Association in early January 1953. McKennell denied hitting the referee and claimed that he was the victim of a plot by Colorado College coach Cheddy Thompson to \"get even\" with Michigan coach Vic Heyliger. Heyliger opined that the suspension was too severe, noting that McKennell had no prior disciplinary action in three years and the evidence was conflicting as to whether McKennell even hit Yalich. Heyliger noted, \"This has ruined Johnny's whole college career.\"\nRight winger Earl Keyes, who served as captain of the 1951–52 Michigan hockey team, graduated in January 1953 and played his final game for the Wolverines on January 17, 1953. At the time, \"The Michigan Daily\" called Keyes \"[o]ne of the best players in Michigan hockey history\" and praised him for his versatility. Keyes played at the center position for two-and-a-half years, moved to right wing in 1952, appeared in several games as a defensemen, and even played at the goalie position for two games. In two games at goalie, he had 49 saves in back-to-back victories over Michigan Tech during the 1950-51 season.\nEarl Keyes, Alex MacLellan, John Matchefts and John McKennell are the only men's ice hockey players in NCAA history to win three national titles. Additionally, they are among the only players to play in a national championship game each season in which they had eligibility (3 seasons for players prior to 1969, 4 seasons for players after 1969).\n1953 NCAA Tournament.\nIn the 1953 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, Michigan and Minnesota were invited to represent the west, and Boston University and Rensselaer Polytechnic were invited to represent the east. In the first round, the Wolverines defeated the Boston University Terriers by a 14–2 score.\nIn the championship game, Michigan faced Minnesota before a capacity crowd of 2,700 at Broadmoor Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Michigan and Minnesota had played four games in the regular season, with Minnesota winning three of the four contests. In mid-February, the Golden Gophers had swept a two-game series in Minneapolis by scores of 5-2 and 4–0.\nMinnesota led 2–1 at the end of the first period of the championship game. Jim Haas gave Michigan a 1–0 lead with a goal at the 5:48 mark of the opening period (assist by Alex MacLellan), but Minnesota took the lead on goals by Dick Meredith and Dick Dougherty. In the second period, Michigan scored two goals to take a 3–2 lead. Doug Philpott scored at the 6:15 mark (with an assist by Reg Shave) to tie the score at 2-2, and Doug Mullen put Michigan in the lead with a goal at the 11:08 mark (with assists by George Chin and Pat Cooney). Michigan added three goals in the first ten minutes of the third period to extend the lead to 6–2. John Matchefts scored an unassisted power play goal at 3:38 of the third period; Jim Haas added an unassisted goal at the 7:17 mark; and Doug Philpott scored on a power play at 9:14 with an assist from Haas.

Additionally, they have been the most successful expansion teams in the major leagues: the Mets and Royals were the first expansion teams in their respective leagues to win not only a league championship pennant (1969 for the Mets and 1980 for the Royals) but the World Series as well (the Mets in 1969 and the Royals in 1985). With five and four pennants respectively, the Mets and Royals have the most league championships among the expansion franchises. Each team was also seeking to end a championship drought; the Royals' previous championship was in 1985, with the Mets' last title coming one year later in 1986.\nNew York Mets.\nThe Mets made their fifth appearance in the World Series after sweeping the Cubs 4–0 in the 2015 National League Championship Series (NLCS). They had split their four previous appearances, winning the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles and the 1986 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, while losing the 1973 World Series against the Oakland Athletics and the 2000 World Series against the New York Yankees, their cross-town rivals.\nThe Mets qualified for the postseason by winning the National League (NL) East, their sixth division title. The third-seeded Mets faced the #2 seed Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2015 NL Division Series, winning in five games. In the 2015 NLCS, Daniel Murphy led the team by hitting home runs in each game of the four-game sweep of the fifth-seeded Chicago Cubs. By winning the NLCS, the Mets ensured they have the most World Series appearances by an expansion franchise with five, though that has since been tied by the Houston Astros. In addition, the Mets have made World Series appearances in all but one of their six decades of existence, not appearing in any that were played during the 1990s. This was the first World Series appearance for Mets' manager Terry Collins.\nKansas City Royals.\nThe Royals made their second consecutive appearance in the World Series, both under Ned Yost, and fourth overall. They won the 1985 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, and lost their two other appearances, the 1980 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and the 2014 World Series against the San Francisco Giants. The Royals qualified for the postseason by winning the American League (AL) Central, their seventh division title and their first since winning the AL West in 1985. The top-seeded Royals faced the #5 seed Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Division Series, winning in five games. They followed that up in the 2015 American League Championship Series, beating the second-seeded Toronto Blue Jays in six games.\nBy winning the ALCS, the Royals became the first team to play in consecutive World Series since the Texas Rangers played in the 2010 World Series and 2011 World Series.\nSeries preview.\nThe series began on October 27. The American League won the 2015 All-Star Game, therefore the Royals had home field advantage for the series.\nThe Mets and the Royals hadn't played each other since 2013. Though the Mets boasted four starting pitchers who could throw over —Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom, and Steven Matz—the Royals had the best team batting average against pitches over that speed during the 2015 season. And while the Mets' starting pitchers had the best strikeout-to-walk ratio in MLB, the Royals' roster of strong contact hitters led baseball in contact rate. The Royals also had a superior defensive team, finishing second in the majors in Defensive Runs Saved, while the Mets finished 21st. The Royals bullpen, anchored by Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera, also provided a strength. While the Mets hitters performed better against left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, the Royals four starting pitchers, Johnny Cueto, Edinson Vólquez, Yordano Ventura, and Chris Young, and primary relievers, Davis, Herrera, Ryan Madson, and Luke Hochevar, are right-handed. This was also the first time the World Series was played by teams which both had entered the league as expansion teams. The Mets joined the National League in 1962, and the Royals joined the American League in 1969. The 2019 World Series would be the next time this would happen.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by George Brett while Andy Grammer sang the national anthem. Matt Harvey started Game1 for the Mets, while Edinson Vólquez started for the Royals. Vólquez's father had died earlier in the day. He was not aware of his father's death until after he left the game.\nOn the first pitch thrown by Harvey, Alcides Escobar hit an inside-the-park home run, the first in a World Series game since Mule Haas in Game 4 of the 1929 World Series, and the first hit by a leadoff batter since Patsy Dougherty did it in Game 2 of the 1903 World Series. In the fourth inning, Murphy recorded the Mets' first hit, and later scored their first run on a hit by Travis d'Arnaud. Curtis Granderson hit a home run in the fifth inning to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The Mets took a 3–1 lead in the top of the sixth when Michael Conforto drove in Yoenis Céspedes with a sacrifice fly. Mike Moustakas then saved a run with a diving stop and throw out to first to end the top of the sixth. Eric Hosmer reduced the lead to 3–2 with a sacrifice fly, and set a new Royals' postseason run batted in (RBI) record in the process. A single by Moustakas tied the game at three, but in the top of the eighth, Wilmer Flores reached on an fielding error by Hosmer, allowing Juan Lagares to score the go-ahead run and give the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the bottom of the ninth with the Mets two outs away from taking Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game for the Royals with a home run to deep center field, as Jeurys Familia blew his first save in six postseason opportunities and his first since July 30. With the home run, Gordon became the first player since Scott Brosius in the 2001 World Series, and just the fifth player in history, to tie a World Series game on a home run in the ninth inning.\nIn the bottom of the 11th inning, Granderson robbed the speedy Jarrod Dyson of a multi-base hit with a running, leaping catch that prevented what probably would have been a lead-off triple. The Mets went on to get out of the inning. In the bottom of the 14th, Escobar reached first on a throwing error by David Wright, and Bartolo Colón gave up a base hit to Ben Zobrist, allowing Escobar to reach third. Hosmer hit a sacrifice fly to Granderson in right field to drive in the winning run. This was the first time in World Series history that the same player scored both the first run of the game on the first pitch, and the last run of the game on the final pitch. The game ended at 12:18a.m. CDT, lasting five hours and nine minutes. The game tied the record for the longest game by innings in World Series history, shared with Game2 in the 1916 World Series and Game3 in the 2005 World Series. However, the record has since been surpassed by Game3 of the 2018 World Series, which was 18 innings long. The loss made Colón the oldest player ever to lose a World Series game.\nGame 2.\nIn Game 2, Jacob deGrom started for the Mets, and Johnny Cueto started for the Royals. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by Medal of Honor recipients Don Ballard, Charles Hagemeister, and Roger Donlon while country singer Sara Evans sang the national anthem. Cueto walked Curtis Granderson to lead off the fourth and Daniel Murphy one out later. Yoenis Céspedes's hit into a forceout at second before Lucas Duda's RBI single put the Mets up 1–0. Duda produced the Mets' only other hit in the game in the second and Cueto retired them in order through the ninth.\nIn the fifth inning, deGrom allowed a leadoff walk to Alex Gordon and subsequent single to Alex Rios before Alcides Escobar's RBI single tied the game. Ben Zobrist's groundout moved the runners up and after Lorenzo Cain lined out to center, Eric Hosmer's two-run single put the Royals up 3–1. Kendrys Morales's single moved Hosmer to third and Mike Moustakas's single made it 4-1 Royals.\nThe Royals blew the game open in the eighth off of Jon Niese, who allowed a leadoff single to Moustakas, subsequent single to Salvador Pérez, and RBI double to Gordon. Addison Reed relieved Niese and allowed a sacrifice fly to Paulo Orlando and RBI triple to Escobar to make it 7-1 Kansas City.\nCueto walked Murphy with two outs in the ninth before getting Cespedes to fly out to right to finish the complete game, becoming the first AL pitcher to accomplish this feat in the World Series since Jack Morris in Game7 of the 1991 World Series, as the Royals defeated the Mets and took a two games to zero lead in the series. Cueto became the first AL pitcher since Jim Lonborg in the 1967 World Series to throw a World Series complete game while allowing two hits or fewer.\n Cueto’s is the most recent World Series complete game as of .\nGame 3.\nThe series shifted to Citi Field, the home stadium of the Mets, for Game3. Yordano Ventura started for the Royals and Noah Syndergaard started for the Mets. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Mike Piazza to catcher Kevin Plawecki while Billy Joel sang the national anthem. With no designated hitter (DH) in NL parks, the Mets started Michael Conforto, their DH for Game2, in the outfield instead of Juan Lagares, and the Royals did not start Kendrys Morales, their regular DH.\nZobrist scored for the Royals in the first inning on a force play. In the bottom of the first inning, Wright hit a two-run homer that also scored Granderson. For the Royals, Alex Ríos drove Salvador Pérez home in the second inning, and scored on a passed ball by d'Arnaud, giving the Royals a 3–2 lead. After a Syndergaard single, Granderson hit a two-run home run just over the right field wall in the third inning, and the Mets took a 4–3 lead. The Mets added a run in the fourth inning on an RBI single by Conforto, and four more in the sixth inning, including an RBI single by Juan Uribe, in his first at bat since September 20. The Royals made a few uncharacteristic mistakes in this game, the first coming in the fourth inning when pitcher Yordano Ventura forgot to cover the base on a ground ball to the first baseman, and the second in the sixth inning when Royals pitcher Franklin Morales triple-clutched Granderson's ground ball, allowing all runners to be safe, which led to a 2-run single by Wright.\nIn the fifth inning, Royals player Raúl A. Mondesí made his Major League Baseball debut, pinch hitting for Danny Duffy. Mondesí became the first player ever to make his MLB debut in the World Series.\nGame 4.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by country singer Tim McGraw, son of former Mets relief pitcher Tug McGraw while Demi Lovato sang the national anthem. The starting pitchers for Game4 were Chris Young of the Royals and Steven Matz of the Mets. Conforto scored the game's first run with a home run in the third inning, and Flores scored later in the inning on a Granderson sacrifice fly, when right-fielder Ríos did not make an immediate throw home (thinking his catch was the third out of the inning). The Royals cut the deficit to 2–1 in the top of the fifth when Pérez doubled and was then driven in by Gordon. However, in the bottom of the fifth, Conforto hit another home run, becoming the first rookie to hit two home runs in a World Series game since Andruw Jones in 1996. In the sixth inning, Zobrist hit his eighth double of the postseason, tying a postseason record previously set by Albert Pujols and David Freese of the 2011 St. Louis Cardinals. Lorenzo Cain drove in Zobrist in to make it a 3–2 game.\nIn the eighth inning, after recording the first out, Tyler Clippard walked two consecutive batters to force Terry Collins to bring in Familia. A key fielding error by Daniel Murphy allowed the tying run to score. The Royals took the lead on an RBI single from Moustakas, and then Pérez added an insurance run with another RBI base hit to give Kansas City the 5–3 lead. For Familia, it was his second blown save of the series, and second out of seven opportunities this postseason, though this one could be partly attributed to Murphy's error. Wade Davis converted a two-inning save for the Royals, his fourth overall this postseason. Davis pitched a perfect eighth, but got into some trouble with one out in the ninth when Murphy hit a hard grounder that Moustakas could not field cleanly, and then Céspedes got a base hit to bring the winning run to the plate in Duda. However, Duda hit a soft line drive that was caught by Moustakas, who then doubled off Céspedes at first to end the game. Céspedes had started running thinking the ball would hit the ground.\nGame 5.\nVólquez returned to the Dominican Republic for his father's funeral the day after Game1, but he returned in time to start Game5. Harvey started for the Mets. New York City Fire Department firefighter Frank Pizarro sang the national anthem, Tony Bennett performed \"America the Beautiful\", and the first pitches were thrown by Cleon Jones, Mookie Wilson, and Darryl Strawberry.\nGranderson led off the first inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets had a chance to break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a sacrifice fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman David Wright. Wright, after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown. Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run. This resulted in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.\nIn the top of the 12th inning, with Addison Reed pitching for the Mets, Pérez hit a single for the Royals. Pinch running for Pérez, Dyson stole a base and scored on a single by pinch hitter Christian Colón. \nColón scored on a hit by Escobar. The Royals loaded the bases, and Cain drove home three more runs with a double off of Bartolo Colón. Davis pitched a shutout inning for the Royals to complete the series and win the championship. With Game 5 having crept well past midnight eastern time, Flores struck out looking to end the game, series, and baseball season, with the Royals winning and ending their 30-year World Series title drought.\nPérez, who batted 8-for-22 (.364) in the series, and caught every inning for the Royals with the exception of the final inning of the series, won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He became the first catcher to win the award since Pat Borders won it in the 1992 World Series, and the second Venezuelan player, following Pablo Sandoval, who won it in the 2012 World Series. Paulo Orlando made history as the first Brazilian player to win the World Series and the third South American to do so, the first was the Venezuelan player Luis Aparicio and the second was the Colombian player Edgar Rentería.\nComposite line score.\n2015 World Series (4–1): Kansas City Royals (AL) beat New York Mets (NL).\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFox broadcast the series in the United States, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck calling the action along with color analysts Harold Reynolds and Tom Verducci and field reporters Ken Rosenthal and Erin Andrews. The pregame and postgame show featured host Kevin Burkhardt with analysts Frank Thomas, Raul Ibanez, Pete Rose, and Alex Rodriguez. Fox Deportes offered a Spanish telecast of the series in the United States. The MLB International feed featured Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz with play-by-play and analysis, respectively.\nFox suffered an outage during their broadcast of followed by a five-minute delay while officials addressed the availability of video review due to the loss of Fox's feed; the teams agreed to allow the use of footage from the world feed of the game for video review. Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from the feed was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.\nThe World Series started on a Tuesday for the second straight year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. The practice was to avoid games on Thursday and Monday nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from \"Thursday Night Football\", \"ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime\", various popular primetime entertainment shows, and \"Monday Night Football\". Had the World Series gone to a Game 6, it would have competed against Election Day coverage for the first time in World Series history, though 2015 was not a presidential or midterm election. All World Series held since 2015 were scheduled to complete prior to Election Day.\nRatings.\nGame 1 of the World Series averaged a 4.6 rating on Fox, making it the most watched Game1 since the 2010 World Series. Game2 then had a 3.9 rating, up 24 percent from last season's Game2. The series also recorded the most watched Game3 since 2009.\nGame 5 went head-to-head with an \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" game between the Green Bay Packers and the Denver Broncos (both undefeated). Media sources like \"Sporting News\" predicted this heavy competition would result in series-low ratings. While the football game drew the larger audience, the Royals and Mets did average a 10.0 rating, the highest for a World Series Game5 since 2003.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio aired the series, with Dan Shulman on play-by-play, Aaron Boone handling color commentary, and Buster Olney serving as field reporter. Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer served as a guest commentator for selected innings in Games 1, 2and 5. Marc Kestecher anchored pre-game and post-game coverage for the network along with Chris Singleton and Peter Pascarelli.\nLocally, the series was broadcast on the teams' flagship radio stations with their respective announcing crews. In New York, WOR aired the games in English, with Howie Rose and Josh Lewin announcing, while WEPN-AM aired the games in Spanish, with Juan Alicea and Max Pérez Jiménez announcing. In Kansas City, KCSP broadcast the games, with Denny Matthews, Ryan Lefebvre, Steve Stewart, and Steve Physioc announcing. WEPN-FM and WHB, the ESPN Radio affiliates in New York and Kansas City respectively, aired the network's coverage of the series in those cities.\nAftermath.\nThe Royals became the first team and in World Series history to start three pitchers—Yordano Ventura, Edinson Volquez, and Johnny Cueto—born outside the United States. Later, the Astros would accomplish this feat when they started four foreign-born pitchers in the 2021 World Series.\nThe Mets and Royals met on Opening Day of the 2016 season, on April 3, 2016, for a Sunday Night Baseball game in Kansas City. It was the first ever time in MLB history a defending champion opened against the team they beat in the World Series. The Mets and Royals split the short two-game series (the Mets would sweep the other half of the four games season series at Citi Field in June).\nAs was the case with their 1985 championship, the Royals missed the postseason a year after winning the World Series. After 81 and 80-win seasons for the next two years, a pair of 100-loss seasons followed in 2018 and 2019, during which management dismantled the core of the 2015 team and Ned Yost retired from managing. Of the players who played for the 2015 Royals, only Salvador Pérez remained with the team as of 2023. The Mets qualified for the 2016 National League Wild Card Game after an 87-win season, but lost to the San Francisco Giants. This was followed by a 70-win season in Terry Collins' final year as manager. To date, neither the Mets or Royals have won a postseason series since the 2015 season.\nThis was the only World Series appearance by a New York City team during the 2010s decade. The Mets losing this World Series made the 2010s the first decade since the 1910s that a New York City team failed to win a World Series.\n\"Back to the Future\" prediction.\nIn the 1989 film \"Back to the Future Part II\", the Chicago Cubs are depicted as the 2015 World Series champions, defeating a fictional American League team from Miami, whose mascot is an alligator, in four-game sweep starting on October 17 and ending on October 21. Screenwriter Bob Gale, who co-wrote the script of \"Back to the Future PartII\", originally intended it as a joke, saying \"Being a baseball fan, I thought, 'OK, let's come up with one of the most unlikely scenarios we can think of, referencing both the Cubs' long championship drought (at the time, having most recently won the 1908 World Series) and the lack (at the time) of any major-league franchise in Florida. He also explained that the October 21 prediction was based on the postseason structure at the time of writing (prior to Division Series or Wild Card Series), and thus could have been accurate.\nIn the actual 2015 postseason, the Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series (NLCS), but were eliminated in four games by the New York Mets. The final game of that series took place on October 21, the same date as the fictional events in the film. The Cubs did win the 2016 World Series, over the Cleveland Indians."

        "text": "Gregory Devon Lewis (born September 6, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player. In college, he was the Big South Conference player of the year as a senior in 2001–02. He was also a two-time Big South tournament MVP in 2000 and 2002. Since graduating he has played professionally in numerous countries, and in 2012–13 he was named Latinbasket.com's All-Liga Americas MVP while playing for Asociación Deportiva Atenas in Argentina.\nEarly years.\nGreg Lewis grew up in Akron, Ohio without a father and admitted that he was \"a little wild\" as a youth. He would run away from home, and his grades at Akron East High School suffered due to his absences (he had to repeat his sophomore year because he missed 160 days of school). Lewis became more focused when he met an ordained minister by the name of John Saucier. Saucier had started Team JAM (Jesus, Athletics, Ministry), a basketball program used to create better role models out of troubled or disadvantaged high schoolers. Saucier also convinced Lewis to attend Medina First Baptist School for a fifth year of high school due to his grades at Akron East. In his final prep year, Lewis increased his grade point average from 0.9 at Akron East to 2.9 by graduation at Medina. On the basketball court, he averaged 29.6 points and 13 rebounds per game en route to all-state honors.\nCollege.\nUnable to play for an NCAA Division I right away, Lewis signed to play for Seward County Community College in Kansas, but due to frequent run-ins with their head coach, he stayed only one semester. The following year, Lewis enrolled at Howard College in Texas, where he averaged 17.9 points and 8.0 rebounds per game and led the team to a 26–6 record. After his year at Howard, he wanted to play for the University of South Alabama, but his mother would not sign the scholarship papers because she felt uncomfortable with that decision, citing that they \"did not have his best interest at heart.\"\nWinthrop University, whose team needed one more forward, still had one scholarship left to offer, so coach Gregg Marshall offered it to Lewis. He accepted, and in 1999–2000 he began his Division I career as a Winthrop Eagle. In his first season averaged 15.7 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, was named the Big South tournament MVP as well as an All-Big South First Team selection. They entered the 2000 NCAA tournament as a 14-seed but lost to Oklahoma, a three-seed, in the first round.\nIn 2000–01, in what should have been Lewis' true senior season, he sustained a foot injury just six games into the season that sidelined him for the whole year. The NCAA gave him a medical redshirt, thus his final collegiate season was actually in 2001–02. That year, Lewis averaged 15.4 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game. The Eagles were co-champions of the Big South regular season and once again won the Big South tournament where they earned a berth into the NCAA tournament. Lewis was named the conference tournament's MVP for a second time as well as another All-Big South First Team selection. He was named the Big South Player of the Year as well as an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press. The Eagles lost to the Duke Blue Devils in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, ending Lewis' collegiate career. He finished his career at Winthrop with 993 points and 542 rebounds in 67 games played.\nProfessional.\nLewis was not selected in the 2002 NBA draft. He has been a journeyman throughout his career, playing in leagues in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Paraguay, New Zealand, Mexico, and Finland. In 2012–13 he was named Latinbasket.com's All-Liga Americas MVP while playing for Asociación Deportiva Atenas in Argentina."

This put Froome in the lead, after the Tour's first uphill finish. He lost the position to 's Tony Martin at the end of the fourth stage, but Martin's withdrawal from the race after a crash at the end of the sixth stage put Froome back into the lead. He extended this lead during the stages in the Pyrenees and defended it successfully against attacks from Quintana during the final stages that took place in the Alps.\nFroome became the first British rider to win the Tour twice, after his 2013 victory. Peter Sagan of won the points classification. Froome also won the mountains classification. The best young rider was Quintana, with his team, Movistar, the winners of the team classification.

He was also aiming to hold all three Grand Tour titles simultaneously, having won the 2014 Vuelta a España. Thirteen days before the start of the Tour, Contador won the Route du Sud, defeating Quintana by seventeen seconds. Quintana placed second in the 2013 Tour, winning the mountains and young rider classifications. He was absent in 2014 as he concentrated on the Giro d'Italia, which he won. His major victory of the 2015 season was the Tirreno–Adriatico. The defending champion Nibali was considered a contender, although his best result of the season was tenth in the Tour de Romandie, and placed thirteenth at the Dauphiné.\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Alexander Kristoff (), Mark Cavendish (), André Greipel (), Peter Sagan () and John Degenkolb (). Kristoff and Cavendish both showed their form during the season coming into the Tour, with eighteen and twelve wins, respectively. Greipel was also a contender, spearheaded by his sprint train, much like Cavendish. Three-time consecutive winner of the points classification Sagan was expected to have a hard time repeating as winner due to the changes in the classification's point structure and also due to the fact he had to ride in support of Contador. Degenkolb, who won the one-day classic races Milan–San Remo and Paris–Roubaix in the season, would take the lead of the team due to the absence of the 2014 Tour's four-stage winner Marcel Kittel, who was not selected due to lack of fitness.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 8 November 2013, the ASO announced Utrecht would host the 2015 edition's opening stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"). It was the sixth time the Tour had started in the Netherlands, a record for a country outside France. The previous five were: 1954, in Amsterdam; 1973, in Scheveningen; 1978, in Leiden; 1996, in 's-Hertogenbosch; and 2010, in Rotterdam. Utrecht paid the ASO a reported €4m to host the \"Grand Départ\". The full route of the Tour was unveiled on 22 October 2014 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, the race director Christian Prudhomme described it as \"atypique\" (English: \"atypical\"), adding \"If you do not climb, you will not win the Tour in 2015.\" The most noticeable differences were the lack of time trial kilometres and the mountainous terrain.\nAfter the first stage in Utrecht, the second stage left the city to finish in the region of Zeeland in the south of the Netherlands. The third began in Antwerp, Belgium, and concluded at the Mur de Huy, a steep climb known for its inclusion in the one-day classic race La Flèche Wallonne. Stage four started in Seraing, before ending in Cambrai, France; it featured seven cobbled sectors with a combined distance of . Stages five to nine crossed northern France westwards, beginning in the region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais and ending in Brittany. A long transfer took the race to the south of the country for next three stages through the Pyrenees, which include the Tour's most climbed mountain, the Col du Tourmalet, on stage eleven. Stages 13 to 16 formed a continuous four-stage journey that navigated eastwards to the Alps; four stages took place in and around the mountain range. A second long transfer took the Tour back to the north-east to finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 2014 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the fourth at , and stage 21 was the shortest at . The opening individual time trial was  – although it was too long to be classified a prologue – and the team time trial on stage 9 was . Of the remaining stages, seven were officially classified as flat, five as medium mountain and seven as high mountain. Stages 3 and 8, although classified as flat, finished at the -high Mur de Huy and -high Mûr-de-Bretagne respectively. There were six summit finishes: stage 10, to La Pierre Saint-Martin; stage 11, to Cauterets; stage 12, to Plateau de Beille; stage 17, to Pra-Loup; stage 19, to La Toussuire to Les Sybelles; and stage 20, to Alpe d'Huez. On 25 June, it was announced that due to a landslide, the route of stage twenty would be changed, bypassing the Col du Galibier and instead climbing the Col de la Croix de Fer. The stage distance, however, remained intact. The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Col d'Allos mountain pass on stage seventeen. There were seven \"hors catégorie\" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The Tour included six new start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, in Pau, and after 16, in Gap.\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\" and journey west.\nThe race's opening individual time trial stage in Utrecht was won by Rohan Dennis of by a margin of five seconds over 's Tony Martin, with 's Fabian Cancellara a further second down. Dennis set the record for the fastest average speed in a time trial at the Tour, with . His win put him in the race leader's yellow jersey. On stage two, crosswinds along the coastal route to the finish in Zeeland caused the peloton (the main group) to split into echelons, resulting in time gaps between riders. The stage ended in a bunch sprint, won by André Greipel, putting him in the green jersey as the leader of the points classification. Dennis was in a group that finished one minute twenty-eight seconds in arrears. Cancellara finished third placed in the stage and took the race lead, profiting from a time bonus missed by Martin, who came in ninth. The general classification favourites that gained time from being in the leading group of twenty-six were Chris Froome, Alberto Contador and Tejay van Garderen; the other favourites finished in the same group as Dennis. On the third stage, the race was neutralised following a major crash from the finish which put six of riders out of the race, including Cancellara. The peloton continued to the final climb, the Mur de Huy, where Joaquim Rodríguez held off Froome to take the stage by one second. Rodríguez was awarded the first the polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification and Froome took the yellow, while also gaining time over the other general classification favourites. It was the third day in succession Martin ended in second place overall, and to three different riders. The partially cobbled fourth stage saw Martin take the victory and the yellow jersey with an attack on the lead group from the finish in Cambrai.\nOn the fifth stage, a bunch sprint occurred and Greipel got the better of it by beating Peter Sagan and Mark Cavendish, respectively. In the sixth stage, Zdeněk Štybar of won after escaping on the concluding small ascent in the port city of Le Havre. A crash in the final kilometre forced Martin to abandon the Tour with a broken collarbone, the second yellow jersey wearer to surrender after Cancellara. A record was set after the stage, with Daniel Teklehaimanot becoming the first black African to lead the mountains classification. Although Froome now led the race, no rider wore the yellow jersey on stage seven as Martin had finished the stage and earned the right to wear it. Cavendish won the seventh from a bunch sprint in Fougères, Brittany. Froome was awarded the yellow jersey after the stage. Stage eight, finishing atop the Mûr-de-Bretagne, saw the first French victory of the Tour, with rider Alexis Vuillermoz launching an attack inside the final kilometre to take the victory. The general classification favourites finished together except Vincenzo Nibali who lost ten seconds. Sagan moved into the green jersey. won stage nine's team time trial by one second over . The squad of Nairo Quintana, , came in third, four seconds in arrears. Alberto Contador's in fourth, twenty-eight seconds down, and Nibali's following, a further seven seconds behind. The first rest day took place the following day in Pau.\nPyrenees and Massif Central.\nStage ten was the race's first arrival at altitude with the finish at La Pierre Saint-Martin in the Pyrenees. The day's breakaway was caught and passed on the final climb by a select group. Froome attacked with remaining to take the win, with teammate Richie Porte and Quintana a minute in arrears. The stage saw time gaps open up across the general classification leaders. The biggest loser was Nibali, who came in twenty-first, over four minutes behind Froome, who increased his lead to second placed Tejay van Garderen to two minutes and fifty-two seconds. Froome took the polka dot jersey and Greipel the green. Stage eleven was another mountainous stage; it was won by Rafał Majka (), who was part of the early breakaway and attacked on the slopes of the Col du Tourmalet. He soloed across the line in Cauterets one minute ahead of second-placed Dan Martin (). The green jersey returned to Sagan. Rodríguez gained his second victory of the race on stage twelve; he was part of an early twenty-two rider breakaway that reached the final climb to Plateau de Beille. Froome kept his lead intact.\nStage thirteen saw the escapees being brought inside the one kilometre to go marker (known as the \"flamme rouge\"). Greg Van Avermaet of took the uphill victory ahead of the chasing Sagan. On stage fourteen, a twenty-four rider breakaway reached the final climb, the Côte de la Croix Neuve. After the breakaway had fractured, Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet led over the summit, before Steve Cummings of overtook them to take the victory at Brenoux Airport on the plateau above Mende. Sagan was part of the breakaway, amassing maximum points at the intermediate sprint. Over four minutes after Cummings had finished, Froome outsprinted Quintana while the other general classification favourites were slightly distanced. Quintana moved into second place overall, displacing Van Garderen. Stage fifteen had for principal difficulty the climb, which saw most of the sprinters succeeding at passing the climb in the lead group, with the notable exception of Cavendish. Greipel won his third stage of the Tour, followed by John Degenkolb and Alexander Kristoff, respectively. On the next stage, featuring the Col de Manse as the final climb, Rubén Plaza () escaped the leading group of breakaway riders on the ascent. Sagan chased him down the descent, but to no avail as Plaza soloed to victory in Gap. The next day was the second rest day, spent in Gap.\nAlps and finale.\nStage seventeen, the first of four Alpine stages, saw third placed overall Van Garderen withdraw from the race with illness. The stage was won by 's Simon Geschke, who escaped from the breakaway with under remaining to win in Pra-Loup. Fifth placed overall Contador crashed on the descent of the Col d'Allos, losing over two minutes to race leader Froome. On stage eighteen, Bardet attacked the breakaway close to the summit of the Col du Glandon and opened a gap on descent before riding solo to victory in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. Bardet moved up to tenth overall and became joint first with Rodríguez in the mountains classification, displacing Froome. In the Tour's queen stage, nineteenth, Nibali broke away from the general classification group close to the summit of the Col de la Croix de Fer to bridge and pass the breakaway group and win at La Toussuire - Les Sybelles. Quintana came in second, forty-four seconds later, with Froome coming in a further thirty. In the Tour's penultimate stage, a select group of riders attacked on the Col de la Croix de Fer and made it to the finish on Alpe d'Huez, where they met the disintegrate early breakaway. Pinot attacked passed the breakaways to take the victory ahead of the encroaching Quintana, who came in second after attacking the chasing general classification group on the Alpe. Quintana gained a margin of eighty seconds over Froome, but it was not enough and had to settle for second place overall.\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Greipel, his fourth victory of this year's Tour. Froome finished the race to claim his second Tour de France, becoming the first British rider to win the race on two occasions. He beat second-placed Quintana by seventy-two seconds, with his teammate Alejandro Valverde third. Froome also claimed the mountains classification, the first time a rider had won both since Eddy Merckx in 1970. Although he failed to win any stages during the race, Sagan won his fourth consecutive points classification with a total of 432, 66 ahead of Greipel in second. The best young rider was Quintana, followed by Bardet and 's Warren Barguil, respectively. finished as the winners of the team classification, over fifty-seven minutes ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 160 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2015 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) returned to the Tour for the first time since the 2008 edition. For all stage finishes, excluding the two time trial stages, the three first finishers of stages earned bonuses of 10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively. Of the reintroduction, race director Christian Prudhomme said: \"We want to open up the race, we want the race to be decided on any day of the Tour.\" If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey. Rain on the final stage forced the final times of the general classification to be taken on the first crossing of the finish line before the ten laps of the cobbled Champs-Élysées. Riders were required to cross the finish line on the final lap to receive their times.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points system was also changed. A stage win was worth 50 points instead of 45, second place awarded 30 instead of 35 and third 20 instead of 30. The sprint points rule change aimed to make a stage win more valuable. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The new system was in effect only on the Tour's six stages classified as flat (stages 2, 5, 6, 7, 15 and 21). On seven stages (the cobble stage and six hillier stages, namely stages 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 16) the rider who won received 30 points, 25 for the second rider, and so on. For the mountain stages (stages 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20) and the individual time trial (stage 1), the winner received 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage nine. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1990. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage, excluding the team time trial; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Romain Bardet won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €2,030,150 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €450,000, with the second and third placed riders got €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded with money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. Team prizes were available, with €10,000 for the winner of team time trial and €50,000 for the winners of the team classification. €8,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage eleven, and the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier in stage twenty. Due to a route change the Souvenir Henri Desgrange was replaced with the Col d'Allos in stage seventeen. Rafał Majka won the Jacques Goddet and Simon Geschke won the Henri Desgrange.\nUCI World Tour rankings.\nRiders from the WorldTeams competing individually, as well as for their teams and nations, for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Points were awarded to the top twenty finishers in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage. The 238 points accrued by Chris Froome moved him up to second in the individual ranking, behind Alejandro Valverde. Despite 's strong showing, took over the lead of the team ranking due to Froome's points. With three riders in the top ten, Spain remained the leaders of the nation ranking."

Home games are played at the Sports Complex Neder-Over-Heembeek.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1957. In 1999 Excelsior merged with AERA Castor and renamed itself AERA Excelsior Brussel VZW. After 7 years in the 3e Nationale, the Belgian third division, Excelsior promoted to the 2e Nationale in 2009. In the first two years, Excelsior finished 4th and 5th and was defeated in the quarterfinals. In the 2011–12 season Excelsior reached the semifinals and in the 2012–13 season, it finished 10th while missing the Playoffs.\nThe club moved to the professional Scooore League, the first tier in Belgium, for the 2013–14 season. Excelsior received a C-licence, which allowed them to play with a lower budget in the league. The club also got a new main sponsor in Basic-Fit, and was renamed Basic-Fit Brussels.\nDuring the 2016–17 season, Brussels participated in a European competition for the first time by entering the 2016–17 FIBA Europe Cup season. Brussels finished fourth and last in Group A, winning one out of six games. Along with this, the club finished in the third place in the Belgian League and reached the Finals for the first time in club history by beating Antwerp Giants in the semi-finals.\nIn July 2019, the club announced it changed its name to Phoenix Brussels. From December 2020 to March 2021, Phoenix played its home games in the Palais 12. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no people in attendance.\nSince the 2021–22 season, Brussels plays in the BNXT League, in which the national leagues of Belgium and the Netherlands have been merged. On 17 June 2022 the club signed a sponsor agreement with Circus, leading to a name change; the club colours were also changed to red. The team also signed Belgian national team player Kevin Tumba. \nIn march 2023 Brussels announced that head coach Jaumin would be replaced by Serge Crevecoeur for the 2023-2024 season.\nIn early 2023, Belgium adopted a new law prohibiting the promotion of gambling. Consequently, the club had to remove their sponsor \"Circus\" from their name during the summer of the same year.\nArenas.\nUpon the club's establishment in 1957, the team played outdoors on the field of the King Baudouin Stadium (then the Heysel Stadium). The current home arena of Brussels is the Sports complex Neder-Over-Heembeek.\nSince 2017 the team regularly plays gala matches in Palais/Paleis 12. In the 2020–2021 season, the team made a temporary move to the venue for all games from December 2020 to April 2021.\nNames.\nDue to sponsorships and other reasons, the name of the club has frequently changed:"

        "title": "Netherlands at the 2014 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The Netherlands competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia from 7 to 23 February 2014. The Dutch team was the largest Dutch delegation at a Winter Olympics, with 41 competitors that participated in bobsleigh, short track speed skating, snowboarding, and speed skating.\nWith a total of 24 medals, it turned out to be the most successful Winter Games ever for the Dutch team. The Dutch team won 23 medals in speed skating and one medal in short track speed skating. Olympic speed skating records were set on the men's 5,000 metres by Sven Kramer, the men's 10,000 metres by Jorrit Bergsma, the men's team pursuit by Jan Blokhuijsen, Sven Kramer and Koen Verweij, the women's 1,500 metres by Jorien ter Mors and the women's team pursuit by Marrit Leenstra, Jorien ter Mors and Ireen Wüst. By sweeping the podium in speed skating at the men's 500 m, 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres, and the women's 1,500 m, the Netherlands became the first country in Winter Olympics history to achieve four podium sweeps at one edition of the Games.\nKing Willem-Alexander, Queen Máxima, Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and Minister of Health, Welfare, and Sport Edith Schippers attended the Olympics. The Holland Heineken House was the meeting place for supporters and athletes during the Olympics.\nMedalists.\nThe Dutch team won 24 medals of which 23 were in (long track) speed skating and one in short track speed skating.\nThe speed skaters swept the podiums in the men's 500 metres, men's 5,000 metres, men's 10,000 metres, and the women's 1,500 metres. The Netherlands is the first country to achieve four podium sweeps at one Winter Olympics edition (beating the previous record of two which was achieved by Norway in 1924, 1928 and 1932, Soviet Union in 1964, East Germany in 1972 and 1984 and Germany in 1998).\nIn the women's 1,500 metres speed skating, Dutch athletes placed 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th; the first such result in Olympic speed skating history by athletes from a single nation.\nTeam.\nThe Dutch team consisted of 41 competitors that participated in bobsleigh (6), short track speed skating (10), snowboarding (6), and speed skating (20). It was the largest Dutch delegation ever at the Winter Olympics. It was also the first time that the Netherlands had an athlete competing in two different sports: Jorien ter Mors competed in both short track speed skating and speed skating. Jorien ter Mors was the Dutch flag bearer at the opening ceremony and Bob de Jong was the flag bearer at the closing ceremony. Maurits Hendriks was the \"chef de mission\" for the Dutch team.\nSports.\nBobsleigh.\nThe Dutch bobsledders (6 athletes) competed with one team in each bobsleigh event: two-man, four-man, and two-woman. Their best result was a fourth place of the two-woman team.\nShort track speed skating.\nThe Dutch short track speed skaters (10 athletes) competed in all eight short track events.\nThe Netherlands qualified the maximum of five skaters of each gender for the Olympics during World Cup 3 &amp; 4 in November 2013. Four men qualified for the 500 metres, but only three were allowed to start. The selection committee of the Dutch Speed Skating Federation (KNSB) decided that Daan Breeuwsma would not compete in the 500 metres.\nSjinkie Knegt won the bronze medal in the men's 1000 metres, which is the first ever Olympic medal in short track speed skating for the Netherlands.\nSnowboarding.\nThe Dutch snowboarders (6 athletes) competed in five of ten snowboarding events: men's halfpipe (2), women's slopestyle (1), women's parallel giant slalom (2), women's parallel slalom (2), and women's snowboard cross (1). None of the competitors advanced to the finals of their disciplines.\nSpeed skating.\nThe Netherlands qualified the maximum of ten speed skaters of each gender. Individual riders were selected from the results of the Dutch Olympic Qualification Tournament, held between 27 and 30 December 2013 in Thialf, Heerenveen.\nThe Dutch speed skaters competed in all twelve long track events. The Netherlands dominated in speed skating, winning eight out of the 12 gold medals and a total of 23 out of 36 medals (of which any team, of course, could win a maximum of 32), with medals in all events. There were four Dutch podium sweeps at the men's 5000 m, men's 500 m, women's 1500 m and men's 10000 m. The women's 1,500 metres resulted in the Dutch women placing 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th; the first such result by a single nation since East Germany dominated the men's singles luge competition at the 1972 Winter Olympics.\nMargot Boer, by winning the bronze medal in the women's 500 metres, won the first ever Dutch Olympic medal in that event, while Michel Mulder was the first Dutch man to win gold at the 500 metres.\nSupporters.\nDignitaries.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and King Willem-Alexander attended the Olympics, despite the recent troubled Dutch relationship with Russia. The pair was accompanied by the King's wife Queen Máxima and Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport Edith Schippers, with the King's status as an Honorary member of the IOC adding to the significance of his visit. The visit was controversial due to the Russian anti-gay laws. On the second day of the Games, King Willem-Alexander awarded the medals to the three Dutch medalists of the men's 5000 metres speed skating during the victory ceremony at medal plaza.\nNational house.\nDuring the Games, the Netherlands had a national house; the 12th edition of the Holland Heineken House. Organized by NOC*NSF and Heineken, the Dutch national house was a meeting place for Dutch supporters, athletes and other followers. The Dutch national house was located 5 km south of the Olympic Park at the Azimut Hotel Resort. King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima, as well as Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the Dutch national house during the Games."

The Belgian competitors are selected by coaches of the Royal Belgian Cycling League. Apart from cycling events at the four-yearly Summer Olympics, the only times that road cyclists appear in proper national selections (instead of in commercial cycling teams) of one or multiple athletes are the yearly UCI Road World Championships. Because of this, all Belgian national road cycling teams (either elite, amateur or younger teams) only compete as such during one day per year. Belgium first sent athletes to the World Championships in the early 1920s when only amateur cyclists competed. The nation's first medal, a gold, was earned by Henri Hoevenaers in the men's amateur road race in 1925.\nList of medalists.\nThis is a list of all Belgian medals (including elite, amateur, under-23 and junior races).\nSince the 2012 UCI Road World Championships there is the men's and women's team time trial event for trade teams and these medals are included under the UCI registration country of the team. Note that in these events also foreign cyclists can belong to the \"national\" team.\nMedals by discipline.\n\"Updated after the 2023 UCI Road World Championships on 13 August\""

        "title": "List of Olympic men's ice hockey players for Russia",
        "text": "Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920; after its introduction at the 1920 Summer Olympics, it was permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. Russia has participated in 6 of 23 tournaments, sending 14 goaltenders and 84 skaters. The Russian national team is co-ordinated by the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia and players are chosen by the team's management staff.\nPrior to the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian players competed as part of the Soviet Union national ice hockey team. Nine former Soviet states became part of the IIHF and started competing internationally, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Russia. At the 1992 Olympics, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan competed as one entity, known as the Unified Team. In the final, the Unified Team defeated Canada to win gold while Czechoslovakia won the bronze. Russia's first tournament as a separate nation came at the 1994 Games, where they lost the bronze medal game to Sweden. The following tournament, Russia advanced to the gold medal game, but was shut out by the Czech Republic and settled for the silver medal. After a bronze medal at the 2002 tournament, Russia has failed to medal in the past two Olympics. The 2014 tournament was hosted in Sochi, and the Russian team didn't win a medal.\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.\nRussia has won two medals in men's ice hockey, a silver medal in the 1998 Games, and a bronze at the 2002 Games; nine players—Pavel Bure, Valeri Bure, Sergei Federov, Sergei Gonchar, Darius Kasparaitis, Igor Kravchuk, Boris Mironov, Alexei Yashin and Alexei Zhamnov—have won medals with both teams. Three players have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Hall of Fame and Hockey Hall of Fame – Pavel Bure, Sergei Fedorov, and Igor Larionov. Gonchar has played in 24 games over four tournaments, more than any other player. Bure has the record for most goals (11), while Pavel Datsyuk holds the record for most assists (15) and most points (20).\nGoaltenders.\nReserve goaltenders.\nThese goaltenders were named to the Olympic roster, but did not receive any ice time during games. Ilya Bryzgalov did not play in any games during the 2002 Winter Olympics and Semyon Varlamov did not play during the 2010 Winter Olympics, but both started games at later tournaments."

        "text": "The 2014 FIA World Endurance Championship season was the third season of the FIA World Endurance Championship auto racing series, co-organized by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series was open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars from four ACO categories. World Championship titles were awarded for Le Mans Prototypes drivers and for LMP1 manufacturers, and several World Endurance Cups and Endurance Trophies were also awarded. The eight race series began in April at the Silverstone Circuit and concluded in November at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace.\nThe World Endurance Championship for Drivers was won by Toyota Racing pairing Anthony Davidson and Sébastien Buemi, as they won four of the season's eight races. Davidson and Buemi finished as champions by 39 points, ahead of Audi Sport Team Joest trio Marcel Fässler, André Lotterer and Benoît Tréluyer, who won successive races at Le Mans and the Circuit of the Americas. Ten points further behind in third place, was the Porsche Team's Romain Dumas, Neel Jani and Marc Lieb. With their victory in São Paulo, Dumas, Jani and Lieb gained the tie-break over Audi Sport Team Joest's Lucas di Grassi and Tom Kristensen. The season's other event was won by the sister Toyota team of Mike Conway, Stéphane Sarrazin and Alexander Wurz in Bahrain, while Nicolas Lapierre was a part of the winning team at Silverstone and Spa with Davidson and Buemi. With five wins, Toyota won the World Endurance Championship for Manufacturers, 45 points ahead of Audi. Rebellion Racing won the two privateer trophies on offer for the LMP1-L cars, winning all eight races; five wins for the No. 12 entry of Mathias Beche, Nick Heidfeld and Nicolas Prost, with three wins for the sister No. 13 entry of Andrea Belicchi, Dominik Kraihamer and Fabio Leimer.\nConsistent finishing within the LMP2 class was enough to give the No. 27 entry from SMP Racing the FIA Endurance Trophy for the class, while Sergey Zlobin won the drivers' championship. Despite only winning at Le Mans – which awarded double points, where he was partnered with Anton Ladygin and Mika Salo – Zlobin, achieved six podium finishes with four different teammates and won the championship by nine points. G-Drive Racing, with drivers Julien Canal, Olivier Pla and Roman Rusinov won four races, but retirements at Le Mans and São Paulo ultimately denied them the titles. Similarly, seven points further in arrears, KCMG with drivers Richard Bradley and Matthew Howson won three races but also suffered two retirements at Le Mans and Shanghai. Tsugio Matsuda (Circuit of the Americas) and Alexandre Imperatori (Bahrain and São Paulo) were also part of winning KCMG teams, but did not contest the whole season.\nIn the GT element of the series, the World Endurance Cup was won by AF Corse and drivers Gianmaria Bruni and Toni Vilander. Bruni and Vilander took 4 victories during the season, and finished 33.5 points clear of the next best driver Frédéric Makowiecki, driving for Porsche Team Manthey. Makowiecki won twice during the season, winning with Marco Holzer and Richard Lietz at Silverstone, and with Patrick Pilet in Shanghai. Lietz and Pilet finished third and fourth in the standings respectively. The only other winners in the GT standings as a whole, was Aston Martin Racing at the Circuit of the Americas and São Paulo, with drivers Stefan Mücke and Darren Turner. In the Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Pro teams standings, AF Corse finished 20 points clear of Porsche Team Manthey. In the separate sub-classifications for the LMGTE amateur class, Aston Martin Racing won seven out of the eight races, to take a 1–2 in the teams' championship. In the drivers' championship, David Heinemeier Hansson and Kristian Poulsen won the title with four wins and four second places. They finished 34 points clear of the sister entry of Paul Dalla Lana, Pedro Lamy and Christoffer Nygaard, who won a trio of races. Third place went to Nicki Thiim, 20 points further adrift, who was a part of the Heinemeier Hansson-Poulsen entry at 5 events. The season's other winners were AF Corse at Spa, with drivers Marco Cioci, Luis Pérez Companc and Mirko Venturi.\nCalendar.\nA provisional calendar was published by the FIA World Endurance Championship on 20 September 2013. All eight races remained from the 2013 schedule, although with some dates changed. On 18 October, the calendar was revised to avoid some collisions with Formula One races. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting on 4 December 2013 the FIA confirmed the 2014 schedule. The round at Fuji Speedway took place on 12 October, avoiding a clash with the United SportsCar Petit Le Mans, and the provisional round at Interlagos was confirmed. The schedule was revised again on 31 January 2014, moving the São Paulo round to 30 November to avoid clashes with Formula One.\nThe rounds at the Circuit of the Americas and the Bahrain International Circuit both finished in night-time conditions.\nEntries.\nThe FIA unveiled an entry of 31 cars for the 2014 season of the World Endurance Championship, divided into five categories: Le Mans Prototype 1-Hybrid (LMP1-H), 1-Lightweight (LMP1-L), and 2 (LMP2), and Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) and Amateur (LMGTE Am).\nLMP1-H.\nLMP1-H became the unique category for the factory prototype teams in 2014 after the LMP1 category was split in two. Audi returned with a revised R18, led by the defending World Champion duo of Tom Kristensen and Loïc Duval, joined by Lucas di Grassi. 2012 World Champions Benoît Tréluyer, Marcel Fässler, and André Lotterer were in the sister Audi, while a third car also entered the Spa and Le Mans rounds. Toyota also returned with an all-new TS040 while retaining the same drivers from their past two seasons. Porsche expanded their World Endurance Championship effort beyond LMGTE with their all-new 919, bringing with them a collection of factory drivers, former Formula One driver Mark Webber, and newcomer to the championship Brendon Hartley.\nLMP1-L.\nThe new LMP1-L category, designed solely for privateers without hybrid systems in their cars, featured two-time winners of the FIA Endurance Trophy for Private LMP1 Teams, Rebellion Racing. The team developed two all-new Toyota-powered R-One chassis, but started the season with their familiar Lolas while they awaited the completion of the R-Ones. Fabio Leimer of Switzerland became the new rookie on the team, replacing Neel Jani, who was promoted to the Porsche factory team. The Kodewa-backed Lotus team moved up from the LMP2 category with their new CLM P1/01 with a new engine in the World Championship from British firm Advanced Engine Research (AER). However, Lotus missed the season's first three races as the car was not yet ready.\nLMP2.\nThe LMP2 class, nine strong in 2013, saw a significant reduction in its entrant list for 2014, with defending LMP2 champions OAK Racing downsizing their operation to a single Morgan entry, taking over the Russian G-Drive title that came with driver Roman Rusinov, before being replaced mid-season by OAK's newer Ligier JS P2 model. Russian outfit SMP Racing, in conjunction with AF Corse, shifted from the European Le Mans Series with their pair of Orecas, while Hong Kong-based team KCMG moved from the Asian Le Mans Series with a solo Oreca, after running invitational entries in the WEC in 2013. Greaves Motorsport returned to the European Le Mans Series for 2014 after two years in the WEC, while PeCom Racing's LMP2 effort was dissolved. Delta-ADR and Fabien Giroix, formerly of Gulf Racing Middle East, merged their teams under the Millennium Racing name, but the two-car entry withdrew from the series prior to the first round due to financial problems. Strakka Racing announced a switch from the LMP1 category to co-develop an LMP2 coupé with Japanese manufacturer Dome, the S103. However, Strakka's 2014 program was delayed and eventually cancelled after issues with developing the car evolved.\nLMGTE Pro.\nMuch remained the same in the LMGTE Pro category, with Porsche, Aston Martin, and AF Corse Ferrari each with two full-season cars. Davide Rigon was promoted within AF Corse following the departures of Giancarlo Fisichella and Kamui Kobayashi, while Frédéric Makowiecki switched allegiances from Aston Martin to Porsche. Fernando Rees, LMGTE Am champion in 2012 with Larbre Compétition, was promoted to LMGTE Pro alongside Darryl O'Young and Alex MacDowall, with their World Touring Car Championship team Bamboo Engineering, associated with Aston Martin to lead one of the company's entries. British privateers Ram Racing moved to the World Endurance Championship after their 2013 European Le Mans Series LMGTE title led by Matt Griffin and Álvaro Parente in the first of the team's Ferraris. However, the team withdrew from the series after Le Mans.\nLMGTE Am.\nDefending LMGTE Am champions 8 Star returned with their Ferrari, picking up Proton Competition's Paolo Ruberti and Gianluca Roda to co-drive with team owner Enzo Potolicchio. They were joined in the Ferrari camp by AF Corse as well as Ram Racing's second Ferrari, which was also withdrawn after Le Mans. Proton Competition upgraded their Porsche to the 2013-specification 911 RSR, while series newcomers Prospeed Competition bolstered Porsche's efforts. Aston Martin also retained their dual amateur entries, with 2013 LMP2 championship runner-up David Heinemeier Hansson moving to the all Danish squad. Krohn Racing returned to the United States for the United SportsCar Championship, while IMSA Performance entered the European Le Mans Series. 2012 LMGTE Amateur Endurance Trophy winners Larbre Compétition switched to the European Le Mans Series, competing in LMP2; the team had the intention to take part in the WEC rounds following the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but later backed out of these plans.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below.

        "title": "Takashi Ishii (baseball)",
        "text": " is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher and coach. He pitched for 14 seasons for the Seibu Lions and made three All-Star teams. His brother Akio Ishii was drafted in 1986 but never made it into Nippon Pro Baseball.\nCareer.\nTakashi Ishii played for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama in the industrial leagues out of high school. While with Mitsubishi, he was timed at 94 mph. Seibu drafted him in the first round in 1993. In 1994, the rookie was roughed up for 14 hits and 13 runs in 6 2/3 innings for Seibu. He improved to 2-2, 4.03 as a swingman in 1995 but allowed a .304 average.\nIn 1996, Ishii was 3-6 with four saves and a 2.93 ERA. Among Lions hurlers with 50+ innings, only closer Tetsuya Shiozaki had a better ERA. Takashi was 10-8 with nine saves and a 3.61 ERA in 59 outings in 1997. He was second on Seibu in appearances after LOOGY Takehiro Hashimoto, tied Shinji Mori for the most saves and tied Kiyoshi Toyoda for third in wins. He made the Pacific League All-Star team for the first time. He allowed eight hits and four runs (three earned) in 5 2/3 IP in the 1997 Japan Series, but the team fell to the Yakult Swallows.\nThe Kanagawa native was 9-3 with a 3.29 ERA in 1998 while moving primarily into the rotation. He tied Tomohiro Kuroki for second in the circuit in ERA behind Satoru Kanemura but failed to make the All-Star team. He started and won game four of the 1998 Japan Series after relieving in game two; he was 1-0 with a 2.61 ERA and 0.67 WHIP for the Series, which Seibu dropped to the Yokohama BayStars in six games.\nIshii turned in a 13-8, 3.07 campaign in 1999, his first year full-time as a starter. He made his second All-Star team. He was sixth in the circuit in ERA and fifth in wins. He had the second-best ERA on the Seibu starting staff, trailing Daisuke Matsuzaka, on a strong rotation including Toyoda, Shiozaki (at times), Mori (at times), Fumiya Nishiguchi and Matsuzaka.\nIn 2000, Takashi fell to 10-7, 4.31. In May, he was hit in the head by a Koji Akiyama liner but did not sustain serious injury. He made his last All-Star team that season. He tied six others for the league lead with two shutouts. In 2001, Ishii was 5-9 with a 3.76 ERA. The veteran right-hander rebounded to 8-3, 3.11 in 2002. Had he qualified, he would have ranked fifth in the PL in ERA. Among Seibu's regularly-used starting pitchers, only Chih-Chia Chang had a better ERA while Ishii out-pitched Koji Mitsui, Nishiguchi, Ming-Chieh Hsu, Shiozaki and Matsuzaka. Seibu was swept in the 2002 Japan Series by the Yomiuri Giants; Ishii started and lost game two. He was roughed up for seven hits and six runs in just two innings before Hsu relieved him.\nIshii was 1-2 with a 4.24 ERA in 2003 while battling shoulder problems. Not fully healthy in 2004, he was just 1-5 with a 4.65 ERA. Matsuzaka, Nishiguchi, Chang and Kazuyuki Hoashi all had better regular seasons, but Seibu skipper Tsutomu Itō\n still went with Ishii to start game one of the 2004 Japan Series. He turned in a gem, a combined shutout of the Chunichi Dragons for the win. He did not pitch again until game seven, when he was called on to face Domingo Guzmán in the finale. Ishii again pitched shutout ball to get the win (his bullpen did allow two late runs). He finished 2-0 with 13 scoreless innings and only five hits for the Series, having won more games than he had in the entire regular season, something no one had ever done before. He was named Japan Series MVP, presumably his career highlight.\nIshii fell to 2-4, 8.04 in 2005 with a .353 opponent average. He rebounded to 4-1, 3.49 in 2006 while pitching full-time as a reliever for the first time in nine years. He allowed six runs in 7 1/3 innings in 2007 to end his playing career. He later was Seibu's pitching coach.\nOverall, Takashi Ishii was 68-58 with 13 saves and a 3.78 ERA in 321 games in Nippon Pro Baseball.\nIshii retired after the 2007 season, and became a pitching coach for the Lions."

Jewell left the team during the season for an appendectomy. He was replaced in goal by Bill Chase.\nSherf scored more goals during the 1934–35 season than all of Michigan's opponents combined. He scored four goals in the opening game of the season against the Essex Frontiers. During a two-game series on the road against Minnesota in January 1935, Sherf played the entire 140 minutes of both games (including overtime) \"without a penalty and with relief only to change sticks.\" Sherf later played for the Detroit Red Wings and in 1937 became the first U.S. citizen to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup.

In its 11th year under head coach Vic Heyliger, the team compiled an 18–5–1 record, outscored opponents 107 to 70, and won the 1955 NCAA men's ice hockey tournament. The 1955 championship was Michigan's fifth NCAA hockey championship in eight years.\nDuring the regular season, the Wolverines finished in second place in the Western Intercollegiate Hockey League (WIHL) with a 13-5-0 record against conference opponents.\nTeam captain Bill MacFarland was the leading scorer with 56 points on 33 goals and 23 assists. For the second time in program history, six Michigan players were selected as first-team All-Americans. The All-American selections were defensemen Mike Buchanan and Bob Schiller, goalie Lorne Howes, and forwards MacFarland, Dick Dunnigan, and Tom Rendall. Howes, MacFarland, and Rendall were also named to the NCAA Frozen Four All Tournament First Team.\nSeason.\nMichigan was coming off of their seventh consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament but after losing what the team deemed to be inferior opponent the Wolverines saw their championship run end in the semifinal. Head Coach Had the Maize and Blue raring to go against McGill for their home opener, winning 7–2 but the team appeared to slip a bit after that. They finished their non-conference schedule 3–0–1 but when they headed to Colorado to face the Tigers and the Pioneers they came home with only 1 win in four games. After taking both games against hated rival Michigan State in a home-and-home series they split two consecutive weeks against Minnesota and Michigan Tech.\nWith more than half of their season over the Wolverines were at risk of missing the tournament for the first time with only a middling 5–5 record in the WIHL. Beginning with their second series against the Spartans in mid-February Michigan began showing the mettle that earned them four national titles in six years. The defense buckled down while the Wolverine attack seemed to score at will, winning eight straight games while averaging almost six goals per game. The winning streak allowed Michigan to separate themselves away from the rest of their competition and join Colorado College comfortably at the top of the conference. With a second-place finish in the WIHL Michigan received the #2 western seed and they headed back to Colorado Springs.\nThe Wolverines began the 1955 championship against Harvard who were led by the nation's leading scorer in Bill Cleary (who averaged more than 4 points per game by himself). The Crimson offense was stymied by the Wolverines who continued to rack up the goals and take the semifinal 7–3. Two days later the Wolverines were again facing Colorado College in what amounted to a road game though this time the winner would skate away with the national championship.\nTom Rendall opened the scoring less than three minutes into the game and after exchanging the lead the Wolverines ended the first up 2–1. The CC offense started to ratchet itself up in the second, outshooting Michigan 15–6 but the second frame ended with the same score as the first. The Tigers increased their pace even more in the third but it was Michigan's Jay Gould who found the net first, increasing the Wolverine lead to 3–1. Colorado College did close the gap back to a single goal but less than a minute later Michigan restored their two-goal advantage. Clare Smith got the Tigers back within one less than three minutes left but Lorne Howes refused to allow any more recording his 47th save of the night before captain Bill MacFarland salted the game away with an empty-net marker at 19:57. Despite the herculean effort by the Wolverines it was Phil Hilton of the opposition who received the Tournament Most Outstanding Player though Howes, MacFarland and Rendall were all named to the All-Tournament First Team.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The competition was organised and held by the Professional Darts Corporation, with the 2013 edition having a prize fund over £200,000.\nThe format of the tournament is similar to the Premier League Darts tournament, also organized by the PDC, except it is contested by a larger pool of players who are split up into a number of groups. Phil Taylor was the defending champion and won his fourth Championship League title with a 6–3 defeat over Michael van Gerwen in the final.\nFormat.\nThe first group consists of the top eight players from the PDC Order of Merit. These eight players will play each other over the course of a day, receiving two points for each win. All matches were contested over a maximum of 11 legs with a player winning the match on reaching six legs. After all players play each other, the four players with the most points will progress to the semi-finals with the winners of those matches progressing into the final.\nThe winner of the final advances to the winners group which will take place at the end of the competition. The runner-up, losing semi-finalists and the players finishing fifth and sixth move into group two, where they will be joined by the next three players in the Order of Merit. The format of the second group was the same as the first group with players moving into the third group. In total there are eight groups before the final group takes place.\nThis format ensures that all players who do not win the group or finish in the last two positions have another chance to qualify for the winners group.\nPrize money.\nThe Championship League Darts awards prize money per leg won, as well as to the eventual winner, runner-up and semi-finalists of the entire tournament. &lt;br&gt;The amount of prize money awarded per leg won is:\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe amount of prize money awarded to the winner, runner-up and semi-finalists of the tournament is:\nTournament dates.\nThe tournament takes place over nine days throughout September and October 2013.

Winners were chosen by the Iowa Newspaper Association at the time of its annual All-State selections until 2018. The Iowa Print Sports Writers Association now selects the award using the same format.\nFrom 1990 to 1993, two awards were given, one for a 5-on-5 player and one for a 6-on-6 player, when girls in Iowa played in the two systems based on division. Prior to 1990 award winners played 6-on-6 basketball, and since 1993, award winners have played 5-on-5 basketball.\nVoting is done on a points system. Each voter selects first, second, and third-place votes. A player receives five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The player who receives the most points receives the award."

A slasher is a fast and athletic player who attempts to get close to the basket for a layup, dunk or teardrop shot. This style of high-percentage two-point play is commonly referred to as slashing.\nSlashers usually take more free-throw shots than other players due to the increased amount of contact made on them as they constantly and aggressively run towards the basket. Many different kinds of slashers gain extra free-throws by \"drawing fouls\", which is deliberately causing contact with a defending player. They may spend many hours working on increasing their free-throw percentage.\nMany players who begin as slashers typically develop their game (especially their jump shot), as age and injuries occur, which may prevent them from being as effective as a slasher (for example, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant both developed a fadeaway jump shot as they got older)."

        "text": "The 2013 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 30th edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. It took place on November 1 and November 2 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The 2013 Breeders' Cup results were highly influential in the Eclipse Award divisional championship voting.\nBreeders' Cup Challenge series.\nThe Breeders' Cup Challenge is a series of races that provide the winners of designated races with automatic \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. For qualifying horses, the Breeders' Cup organization covers the entry fee and provides a travel allowance of up to $40,000 for the connections of horses from overseas. Thirty-six horses entered in the Breeders' Cup races qualified via the challenge series, including four of the winners. These were:\nResults.\nThe two-day attendance for the Breeders' Cup was 94,628, up 5% over 2012, with a Saturday crowd of 58,795, up 7%. Wagering was also up 7% over 2012, though down from the record levels at the 2010 Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs.\nFive Breeders' Cup races were held on Friday, with British-trained horses winning three: London Bridge in the Marathon, Outstrip in the Juvenile Turf and Chriselliam in the Juvenile Fillies Turf. Goldencents won the Turf Sprint for the second year in a row, while Beholder won at the Breeders' Cup for the second time in a row, following up her 2012 win in the Juvenile Fillies with a victory in the Distaff.\nThe highlights of the Saturday card were wins by Mucho Macho Man in the Classic and Wise Dan in the Mile. Mucho Macho Man won by a nose over Will Take Charge, while the favorite Game On Dude finished ninth. Kathy Ritvo became the first female trainer to win the Classic. In the Mile, Wise Dan closed from seventh to win by lengths. His regular jockey John Velazquez was injured in an earlier race so Jose Lezcano was a late substitution. In the Turf, the only two European-based horses in the field finished one-two, with the longshot Magician prevailing over favorite The Fugue. It was Magician's first race since June and his first start at the distance of miles. The Juvenile Fillies was marred by the breakdown of Secret Circle and then a controversial disqualification of She's A Tiger for bumping in the stretch.\nIn the 2013 Eclipse Award voting, six of the eleven flat racing categories were awarded to horses who won at the Breeders' Cup: Wise Dan was named Horse of the Year, Champion Older Male and Champion Male Turf Horse, Beholder was Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, Dank was Champion Female Turf Horse and Groupie Doll was Champion Female Sprinter. In addition, She's A Tiger was voted Champion Two-Year-Old Filly despite her disqualification in the Juvenile Fillies."

The Indian team was led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni while South Africa was captained by AB de Villiers (for ODIs) and Graeme Smith (for Tests). The tour began with the three-match ODI series, with South Africa winning the series 2–0. Quinton de Kock, South Africa's wicket-keeper became the fifth player to score three centuries in consecutive innings of ODIs. South Africa won the Test series 1–0, the first Test ending in a draw. Jacques Kallis, the country's most prolific run-scorer in Tests, announced his retirement from the format after the second Test at Durban.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nThe Test was India's first after the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar. After opting to bat, India posted 280 runs in the first innings. In return, South Africa made 244. India in their second innings went on to score 421 runs with Cheteshwar Pujara scoring 153 and Virat Kohli making 96, falling four runs short of becoming the first Indian no.4 to hit centuries in both innings of a test match. Their 222-run stand is the highest for India in South Africa in tests. Chasing a target of 458 runs, South Africa ended up with 450 runs for the loss of seven wickets, leading to a draw. The team's total of 450, is the second-highest fourth-innings score to draw a match and third overall. Francois du Plessis and AB de Villiers made centuries in the South Africa total. Described as one among the \"closest draws\", the fourth innings total of 450 made by South Africa is the second-highest by a team in a drawn match and third overall. During the match, wicket-keepers from both the teams bowled, making it the first time to happen in the history of Test cricket. Described as one of the \"Closest draws\", the match saw a few players from both sides achieving significant milestones in their careers – India's Zaheer Khan became the fourth Indian to capture 300 wickets in Test cricket. Vernon Philander playing in his 19th Test match, became the fastest bowler to take 100 wickets for South Africa. The Test also marked the eighth occasion where Indian spinners failed to pick up a single wicket.\nStatistics.\nSouth Africa\nIndia"

In 1964–65, in its first first-class match, it suffered the biggest defeat in the history of first-class cricket.\n1964–65 season.\nDera Ismail Khan had been scheduled to play in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1963–64, but withdrew shortly before the competition began.\nHaving previously played in the non-first-class preliminary rounds of the Ayub Trophy, Dera Ismail Khan was among the teams that made their first-class debuts when in 1964-65 all matches in the Ayub Trophy were classified as first-class.\nIn Dera Ismail Khan's first match, a three-day game against Railways at the Railways Moghalpura Institute Ground in Lahore, Railways won the toss and batted. They declared early on the third day at 910 for 6. They then dismissed Dera Ismail Khan for 32 and 27, in a total of 28 overs, thus winning by an innings and 851 runs. For all eleven Dera Ismail Khan players it was their only first-class match.\nDera Ismail Khan were scheduled to play a match in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy later that season, and another match in the Ayub Trophy in 1965–66, but they conceded both matches to their opponents without playing.\n1980s.\nFor the 1983–84 season the BCCP Patron's Trophy (the successor to the Ayub Trophy) was expanded, and Dera Ismail Khan returned to first-class cricket. Over the next three seasons the team played 10 matches, losing nine (eight of them by an innings) and drawing one.\nIn 10 of their 19 innings they failed to reach 100. Their only total over 150 came in their last game, when they made 214 against Hazara in a rain-ruined draw. In this match Sardar Badshah made the team's highest score of 65.\nThe captain in all 10 matches was Arif Khattak. He was also their highest run-scorer and wicket-taker, with 268 runs at 14.88 and 14 wickets at 25.64. His 5 for 46 against Rawalpindi in 1983-84 was the only instance of a Dera Ismail Khan bowler taking five wickets in an innings. Khattak was the only player to take part in all of Dera Ismail Khan's matches.\nCurrent status.\nIn 1986-87 the authorities again rearranged the structure of first-class cricket in Pakistan and Dera Ismail Khan dropped out.\nThe team has continued to play at sub-first-class level. Currently it takes part in the Inter-District Senior Tournament, a three-day national competition.\nDera Ismail Khan did not play any home games when it had first-class status. It now plays its home matches at Gomal University New Campus Ground and the Dera Ismail Khan Cricket Stadium."

        "text": "The men's sprint at the 1996 Summer Olympics (Cycling) was an event that consisted of cyclists making three laps around the track. Only the time for the last 200 metres of the 750 metres covered was counted as official time. The races were held on July 24 through July 28, 1996 at the Stone Mountain Velodrome. There were 24 competitors from 16 nations, with nations once again being allowed to have up to two cyclists each (the limit had fluctuated between one and two for most of the history of the event). The event was won by Jens Fiedler of Germany, the second man to successfully defend an Olympic sprint title (and third to win two gold medals overall). Curt Harnett of Canada also repeated as bronze medalist; he and Fiedler were the fifth and sixth men to win multiple medals of any color in the event. Marty Nothstein of the United States took silver, the nation's first medal in the event since 1984.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Five of the quarterfinalists from 1992 returned: gold medalist Jens Fiedler of Germany, silver medalist Gary Neiwand of Australia, bronze medalist Curt Harnett of Canada, fourth-place finisher Roberto Chiappa of Italy, and eighth-place finisher José Manuel Moreno of Spain. There was no clear favorite. Neither Fiedler nor Harnett had had much success between Games. Neiwand had won the World Championship in 1993; two other recent world champions—American Marty Nothstein (1994) and Australian Darryn Hill (1995) were also competing in Atlanta.\nThe Czech Republic and Slovakia each made their debut in the men's sprint (after the breakup of Czechoslovakia, which had competed 10 times in the sprint). France made its 21st appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches along with the new qualifying round of time trials. There were six main match rounds, with three one-round repechages.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nFive men broke the old Olympic record in the qualifying round, though only three held a new record even temporarily. Eyk Pokorny broke it first, with a 10.233 seconds run. Marty Nothstein was next, at 10.176 seconds. Gary Neiwand finished with the record at 10.129 seconds. Curt Harnett and Jens Fiedler also came in under the old record, but not below the record as it stood during their turn for the time trial.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nTimes and average speeds are listed. All 24 riders advanced to the first round.\nRound 1.\nThe first round consisted of twelve heats of two riders each. Winners advanced to the next round, losers competed in the repechage.\nFirst repechage.\nThe twelve defeated cyclists from the first round took part in the first round repechage. The winner of each heat rejoined the twelve victors of the first round in advancing to the second round.\nRound 2.\nThe second round consisted of nine heats of two riders each. Winners advanced to the 1/8 finals, losers competed in the repechage.\nSecond repechage.\nThe nine defeated cyclists from the second round took part in the second round repechage. The winner of each heat rejoined the nine victors of the second round in advancing to the 1/8 finals.\n1/8 finals.\nThe 1/8 round consisted of six matches, each pitting two of the twelve remaining cyclists against each other. The winners advanced to the quarterfinals, with the losers getting another chance in the 1/8 repechage.\nThird repechage.\nThe six cyclists defeated in the 1/8 round competed in the 1/8 repechage. Two heats of three riders were held. Winners rejoined the victors from the 1/8 round and advanced to the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe eight riders that had advanced to the quarterfinals competed pairwise in four matches. Each match consisted of two races, with a potential third race being used as a tie-breaker if each cyclist won one of the first two races. The winners advanced to the semifinals, with the losers racing in a 5-8 placement race.\nSemifinals.\nThe four riders that had advanced to the semifinals competed pairwise in two matches. Each match consisted of two races, with a potential third race being used as a tie-breaker if each cyclist won one of the first two races.

The 5-8 classification was a single race with all four riders that had lost in the quarterfinals. The winner of the race received 5th place, with the others taking the three following places in order.\nBronze medal match.\nThe bronze medal match was contested in a set of three races, with the winner of two races declared the winner.\nGold medal match.\nThe gold medal match was contested in a set of three races, with the winner of two races declared the winner."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 2013–14",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured Australia during the 2013–14 season from 31 October 2013 to 2 February 2014. The series included the traditional five Tests for The Ashes, and also featured five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three T20 Internationals (T20Is).\nAustralia dominated all three formats on the tour, their only loss coming in the fourth ODI. As a result of the tour, England's Test coach Andy Flower was relieved of his duties with the team, while batsman Kevin Pietersen was informed that he would no longer be considered for selection by the national team.\nSquads.\n±Late addition\nBackground.\nThe two teams were meeting after a gap of less than six months. These back to back Ashes series were being staged after 38 years, reminiscent of the 1970s. The move was initiated keeping in mind the 2015 World Cup that Australia and New Zealand were to host. The previous edition of the Ashes was played in England in July 2013 with England emerging comfortable winners. England had won the previous three editions of the Ashes and were tipped to win this edition as well. They were looking to emulate a feat that had not been achieved since the 1890s, win four Ashes on the trot. Simply going by Australia's performances in the recent past, it was assumed that the result was a foregone conclusion. Australia's batting was clearly found wanting in the previous series and they had lost matches from seemingly comfortable situations, as was seen in Durham and Lord's. The series had was also shadowed by the controversy surrounding Stuart Broad's refusal to walk in the previous series after clearly edging Ashton Agar to Michael Clarke in the first test at Trent Bridge. He was dubbed a \"smug, pommie cheat\" by sections of the media and with coach Darren Lehman's unsavory comments, things were even more interesting.\nTour matches.\nFirst-class: Western Australia Chairman's XI v England XI.\nThe England team arrived in Australia in late October looking to get the tour off to a good start, but the Chairman's XI were more than a match for them. Chris Lynn was loaned to Western Australia by Queensland, overlooked for their Sheffield Shield clash being played at the same time. This move paid off as Lynn made a blistering 104, only his third first-class century as each of Western Australia's top four batsmen made half-centuries. England's fast-bowling trio of Chris Tremlett, Boyd Rankin and Steven Finn struggled for line and length on the WACA wicket and Chairman's XI declared at 5/451. England began to fight back however as Michael Carberry made 78 and both Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell made centuries, the former didn't get out and made 113 and the latter retired on 115. England were eventually bowled out for 391 and half-centuries to Mitchell Marsh and Lynn meant that the game ended in a draw.\nFirst-class: Australia A v England XI.\nEngland turned things around against Australia A as the tourists piled on the runs. Australia A were luckless in the field as England's Michael Carberry and captain Alastair Cook each made 150 as England finished the first day on 318 without loss. The rain was relentless on Days 2 and 3, meaning no play was possible and the game was headed for a certain draw. Both Cook and Carberry retired ahead of Day 4, when Joe Root made 58 and Ben Cutting was the pick of the bowlers. England finally put Australia A out of their misery and declared at 7/430. Only 31 overs were bowled as Alex Doolan made 31 as another tour match went down as a draw.\nFirst-class: Cricket Australia Invitational XI v England XI.\nEngland were dominant early on against the Invitational XI taking 5/93 in just over 30 overs. Ed Cowan provided the only resistance with 51, until the New South Wales duo of Ryan Carters and Peter Nevill fought back with 94 and 83, respectively. The partnership was broken on Day 2 and the visitors were left chasing 304. They passed the total easily as Cook, Trott, Kevin Pietersen and Root all made half-centuries, despite James Muirhead's four wickets. Aaron Finch made a half-century as his side made 261 leaving England with 148 to win and Carberry's fifty ensured that England won by seven wickets.\nTwo-day: Cricket Australia Chairman's XI v England XI.\nAfter losing the first test at The Gabba, the England side headed to Traeger Park in Alice Springs for a two-day game against the Cricket Australia Chairman's XI. In what proved to be a rough first day for England, Gary Ballance was the only man to pass 50 as the tourists made a modest 7/212 before declaring. Steven Cazzulino and Marcus Harris both fell short of half-centuries as the Chairman's XI declared at 8/254. England batted for only 16 more overs for 1/47, of which Carberry made 37 as yet another tour match finished in a draw.\n50-over: Prime Minister's XI v England XI.\nFormer Australia fast bowler Brett Lee was chosen to captain the Prime Minister's XI. This was substantiated as the 37-year-old took the wicket of England captain Alastair Cook. Gary Ballance and Jos Buttler both scored fifties as England made their way to 264. The England bowlers did the rest of the work, led by Ravi Bopara. Brad Hodge and ACT batsman Michael Spaseski provided the only resistance as the Prime Ministers' XI were bundled out for just 92.\nTest series.\nStatistics.\nBatting.\nMost runs \nBowling.\nMost wickets \nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nEngland lost early wickets but Gary Ballance and Eoin Morgan both made half-centuries to steady the ship as England made 269. A 163 run-partnership between David Warner and Aaron Finch, during which the latter became the first Victorian to score an ODI hundred at the MCG, helped Australia cruise to a six-wicket win with 26 balls to spare.\n2nd ODI.\nA remarkable match began well for the tourists. Ian Bell made a half-century, but Jos Buttler fell one short. The English continued to score frequently and Eoin Morgan blasted 106 as England reached 300. The Australians responded well, both Shaun Marsh and Glenn Maxwell scored fifties, but the Australians collapsed to 9/244 and a comeback seemed unlikely, with Australia requiring 57 runs in 6 overs with only one wicket in hand. However, James Faulkner, aided by tail-ender Clint McKay, calmly backed himself to find the required boundaries, which he did with regularity as he smashed the required 57 to carry Australia to a heart-stopping one-wicket victory with three balls to spare.\n3rd ODI.\nAlastair Cook's side won the toss on a pitch favouring the side batting first and made a swift start, yet were slowed down due to Australia's good bowling and fielding. Eoin Morgan was the only batsman to pass 50 for the tourists, his innings cut short by a return catch by Dan Christian amid some controversy. Although no Australian batsman made a hundred, fifties to David Warner and Shaun Marsh meant Australia finished with a seven-wicket victory to take an unassailable 3–0 lead in the series.\n4th ODI.\nOn the 91st day of the tour, England finally beat Australia for the first and only time on the tour. Cook made 44, Buttler hit 71, 55 from Bell as well as 70 from Ben Stokes helped England reach 316. Despite 108 from Aaron Finch, the Australian chase was unsuccessful as England won by 57 runs.\n5th ODI.\nAustralia started slowly, falling to 4/64 before a score of 56 from George Bailey helped them to 217 all out. Cook, Root and Morgan all scored well to take England close, but Ravi Bopara was unable to bring the team to victory, falling victim to an odd stumping by Matthew Wade, as the Australians won the game and the series.\nStatistics.\nBatting.\nMost runs \nBowling.\nMost wickets \nT20I series.\n1st T20I.\nA 106-run partnership set the tone for Australia's dominance as Aaron Finch made 52 and a returning Cameron White made 75. Debutant Chris Lynn smashed 33 as the Australians reached 213 from their 20 overs. England lost wickets frequently and a quick-fire 65 from Ravi Bopara wasn't enough to prevent Australia from winning the game by 13 runs.\n2nd T20I.\nGood bowling from Josh Hazlewood and defensive fielding meant England could only reach 130, thanks in part to Jos Buttler, who top-scored with just 22. Cameron White again put on a show with 58 and Australia's captain George Bailey hit 60 to ensure the target was reached in less than 15 overs.\n3rd T20I.\nOnce again, Cameron White scored quickly and made 41 as cameos from Aaron Finch, Ben Cutting and 49 from George Bailey ensured the Australians made a big total of 195. 34 from Eoin Morgan was the only highlight for England as they slumped to just 111 giving the Australians a 3–0 series victory."

He lost the final 3 games with a right knee injury, which required offseason surgery.\nAs a senior, he received All-Big Eight honors, after leading the conference in tackles (162) and the team in interceptions (3). He also had 10 tackles for loss, 3 sacks and 10 or more tackles in seven games, becoming the first player to win Big Eight Defensive Player of the Week honors two weeks in a row (Nov. 17 and Nov. 24). He posted 12 unassisted tackles and one sack against the University of Kansas. He registered 18 tackles against the University of Missouri. He returned an interception for a 69-yard touchdown against the University of Nebraska. His best game came against Kansas State University, when he registered 24 tackles (second most in school history) and 2 interceptions. In 1978, he won the school's heavyweight boxing championship.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nAfter the Dallas Cowboys entered the 1980 NFL Draft without their first and second round draft choices (traded to the Baltimore Colts for John Dutton), the team made Roe their first selection in the third round (78th overall). As a rookie, he played mainly on special teams.\nOn August 24, 1981, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a sprained ankle. He was released on September 3, 1982.\nBoston Breakers (USFL).\nOn January 1983, he signed with the Denver Gold of the United States Football League, which traded him along with the rights to Dick Jauron to the Boston Breakers in February, in exchange for the rights to Tom Davis and an eighth round draft choice. The Breakers named him their starting inside linebacker.\nMemphis Showboats (USFL).\nIn 1984, he was the Memphis Showboats starting inside linebacker, before being traded in May to the Birmingham Stallions in exchange for a future draft choice.\nBirmingham Stallions (USFL).\nWith the Birmingham Stallions he was a standout linebacker on the league's top defense, before the United States Football League folded.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nAfter the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players.

        "text": "Robert Rhys Davies (born 14 August 1984) is a British Paralympic table tennis player. Davies, who has played table tennis competitively since 2007, was selected for the 2012 Paralympic Games. After winning the 2013 European Championship title in both singles and team events, he was named world number 1 in the class-1 category.\nPersonal history.\nDavies was born in Abergavenny in 1984. He has a twin brother, Richard. A semi-professional rugby player, Davies played at hooker for Brecon RFC. In September 2005, while playing in a home game against Ynysybwl RFC, a collapsed scrum left him with a broken neck. He was air-lifted to hospital by a helicopter, which half an hour earlier had rescued his twin brother from a road accident. Davies was treated at the University Hospital of Wales where he was initially informed that he would not recover movement in his legs and arms. After moving to Rookwood Hospital specialist spinal unit in Llandaff, he regained some use in his arms and hands. During his rehabilitation he met Welsh table tennis player Sara Head who introduced him to the sport.\nTable tennis career.\nDavies, who plays with the paddle strapped to his hand, joined the Great Britain team in 2007, competing in class 1 single events, and class 1–2 team events. In 2011 he competed in the British table tennis open and took the gold in the Men's Single class 1 category. That same year he entered the European Championships in Split, Croatia. He and fellow British player Paul Davies took the silver medal in the class 1 Men's Team competition. In 2012 he represented Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where in the preliminaries he beat Philip Quinlan of Ireland, but a loss to Jean-Francois Ducay of France saw him come second in his league and he failed to advance to the knockout stages.\nIn 2012 Davies travelled to Italy to compete in the 2012 European Championships. There he picked up two gold medals, in the men's singles and, again with Paul Davies, the Men's team 1–2 class. Following his European success, in October 2013, Davies was confirmed as the world number one in the class-1 category, having beaten the previous holder, Holger Nikelis of Germany, in the semi-finals in Italy. Two years later Davies defended his European title beating France's Jean-Francois Ducay 3–2 in the Class 1 final in Vejle, Denmark. He followed this by retaining his team gold, this time alongside fellow Welshman Tom Matthews.&lt;br&gt;\nAt the Rio de Janeiro paralympics in 2016, Davies won Gold by beating Korean Young Dae Joo in the final.\nDavis was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to table tennis."

In 2014, Surfing Australia turned to the alcohol industry for sponsorship after the federal government abolished its anti-alcohol health promotion agency that provided part of the surfing association's funding.\nIn 2015, Surfing Australia congratulated the Olympics' committee choice to include surfing in the Tokyo 2020 Games. In 2017–2018, the HPC was renovated and upgraded to prepare the Australian surfer for the Olympic competition. Surfing Australia also trained the Olympic contestants in a $30-million artificial surf park that pumps out 1,000 waves per hour.\nStructure.\nThe national body has six state member associations:"

        "title": "Skateboarding Australia",
        "text": "Skateboarding Australia (SbA) was the governing body for skateboarding in Australia and is funded by the Australian Federal Government via the Australian Sports Commission (ASC).\nHistory.\nFormation.\nSkateboarding Australia was established in 2005 by the Board members of National Sporting Organisation, Skate Australia (SA).\nDemise.\nIn April 2014, SbA managers made a proposal to Sport Australia to separate skateboarding from Skate Australia and establish a national sporting organisation solely for skateboarding with the majority of funding going to it. This proposal was made without the knowledge of the Skate Australia management or Board. Sport Australia declined and the leader of SbA, Leroy magarnagle, was terminated for gross misconduct.\nIn early August 2014, the parent body of SBA, SA, announced significant structural changes following the appointment of a new chief executive officer (CEO), Dallas Eastley. Former SBA employee Andrew Currie explained on his Facebook page that SA prioritized the attainment of a surplus budget—despite its status as a non-profit organisation—and consequently determined the completion of the National Skateboard Amateur Series, a contest series for amateur skateboarders, as an \"unacceptable risk to the organisation\". Curry explained:\nDespite having completed six of eight stops, with 48 skateboarders qualified (many of whom had already booked and paid for flights and accommodation for the advertised Final in October), and only the Queensland and New South Wales Qualifying stops remaining, the Skate Australia CEO and Board Of Directors determined that, in a year when a major financial partner (Anpha) has been lost, the pursuit of a surplus budget (for a non-profit organisation) was paramount to completing the Titles.\nCurry's post also states that the result of SA's decision harmed the reputation of SbA, removed the possibility of an amateur series for 2015 and led to the loss of employment of the majority of skateboarding staff at SbA. Curry maintained that \"Skateboarding continues to be grossly under-represented in the Skate Australia constitution.\"\nA response from SA was published on the SbA website on 5 August 2014, in which Eastley explained that information was omitted from Curry's post. Eastley stated:\nWe feel compelled to respond to this statement and provide additional information purposefully omitted from this statement in order to provide a complete picture of why it was not possible for the organisation to complete the Am Titles event series.\nFirstly, in the 3 years to June 2014, the activities of Skateboarding Australia (SbA) under the leadership of former SbA/SA management have generated approximately $325,000 in financial losses to the organisation, Skate Australia has maintained its support of Skateboarding each year as these losses accumulated. These losses have now accumulated and significantly weakened the organisation to the point where we no longer have the ability to absorb any further losses.\nWith respect to the Am Titles series, this agreement was negotiated in June 2013 by both SA and SbA’s management at that time. The Nike Am Titles agreement extended from June 2013, through to completion in December 2015 (incorporating both the 2014 and 2015 Am Titles series calendars).\nThe series was co-sponsored by the Australian National Preventative Health Agency (ANPHA), this sponsorship provided approximately 50% of the required funding for the Am Titles series. This sponsorship had a clearly defined end date of 30th June 2014, with any possible extension yet to be determined.\nThose responsible for negotiating this agreement and associated Am Titles series have failed to consider the impact and plan accordingly for the loss of ANPHA sponsorship at 30th June 2014.\nGiven the organisations weakened financial position following the financial losses generated by SbA over the past 3 years, the organisation found itself in a position where even considering all alternative avenues on the table from the ASC and Nike, the organisation was not financially able to continue the series, and remain solvent.\nThe mutual agreement reached between SbA and Nike regarding the termination of the series was absolutely necessary in order to ensure survival of both Skate Australia, and Skateboarding Australia (SbA).\nSkate Australia &amp; Skateboarding Australia remains committed to promoting the growth and development of Skateboarding in Australia, and creating opportunities for Skateboarders nationally.\nOn 14 August 2014, Australian professional skateboarder Renton Millar appeared in Australia's \"Herald Sun\" newspaper, calling for a \"break-away national body\" following SA's actions—Miller cited \"poor management\" as the salient issue. \nIn later years Millar re-established his relationship with Skate Australia, becoming a judge at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics."

        "title": "Canadian Equestrian Team",
        "text": "The Canadian Equestrian Team or CET ( or \"EEC\") collectively describes the athletes that represent Canada at the highest levels of international equestrian competition, specifically at the World Championship, Olympic, and Paralympic levels.\nThere many different equestrian disciplines, with separate and overlapping international governing bodies, responsible for different international championship series. Because of this, the term Canadian Equestrian Team has been used by many equestrian sport organizations since 1840 to describe their most senior teams competing for Canada internationally in a variety of disciplines and in a variety of systems.\nWhen greater precision is needed, a specific team is referred to by its discipline or by the event at which it competes: e.g., the athletes riding for Canada in jumping at the Olympic Games are referred to variously as the \"Canadian Equestrian Team\", the \"Canadian Jumping Team\", the \"Canadian Olympic Equestrian Team\", and the \"Canadian Olympic Jumping Team\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe earliest recorded Canadian Equestrian Team competed at the 1840 Montreal Steeplechase, the first international steeplechase competition in North America. Capt Walter Jones of the Queen's Light Dragoons was the sole CET rider, and represented The Canadas against riders from British regiments. The event was won by Colonel Whyte of Britain's 7th Hussars.\nCanada's first national equestrian championship, the \"Dominion Equestrian Championship\", was held in 1895 in Toronto, in the disciplines of steeplechase, hunt seat equitation, and jumping, with entries from both men and women. Although the victors were the first group of athletes to be described as the Canadian Equestrian Team, they did not go on to compete together internationally.\nMilitary Age.\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, international equestrian sport was dominated by military riders. In Canada, the Canadian Militia (later renamed as the Canadian Army) was recognized by the federal government as the country's first national equestrian federation, and began the process of building the first institutional CET.\nThe first CET that was organized as a formal multi-athlete team to compete together at an international event, was a group of jumpers, selected by the Canadian Militia for the 1909 Military Tournament at the Olympia London International Horse Show. The riders were: Lt Wood Leonard (London Field Battery); Lt Frank Proctor (Governor General's Bodyguard); and Capt Douglas Young (Royal Canadian Dragoons). They finished in fourth place. This team was, however, considered a representative of the Canadian military and not of Canada itself, because it competed only against other military teams.\nThe first group of athletes who were regarded as representatives of all Canadian equestrians (both civilian and military) and who competed together against other national equestrian teams, was selected by the Canadian Militia to compete in Prix des Nations jumping at the 1926 Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in Toronto. The team was composed of Maj R S Timmis, Lt Elliott, and Capt Stuart Bate. All three riders were from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, the only Canadian cavalry regiment to retain horses after the First World War. The team won first place, defeating national teams from Belgium, Britain, France, and the United States.\nThe team went on to compete successfully against other international opponents in New York, Boston, and London.\nGrowth.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the Canadian Army began phasing out its financial support for equestrian sport. Today, the Canadian Armed Forces exercises responsibility for the CET only at the CISM Military World Games.\nThe shrinking role of the eastern-Canada based military coincided with a burst of CET activity in western-Canada. Pete Knight became the CET's first World Champion in 1932, as the RAA World Champion Bronc Rider. He would repeat the feat in 1933, 1935, and 1936, and was popularly known as the CET's \"King of the Cowboys\".\nThe end of centralized control of the CET also caused a series of inter-related civilian groups to come in and out of being, as equestrian sport began a period of significant but disorganized growth across Canada.\nIn 1948, Major General CC Mann founded the Canadian Equestrian Society (CES), in an effort to create a single organizing focus for Canada's eventing and jumping teams. Although the CES lasted only two years, it put in place many of the factors that would continue to define the CET to the present.\nThe CES initiated planning for Canada's Olympic equestrian debut at the 1952 Helsinki Games, it created the maple leaf and horseshoe team emblem, and it popularized the term \"Canadian Equestrian Team\". Critically, when Major General Mann dissolved the CES in 1950, he placed its material and intellectual assets in the public domain. This enabled others to complete the process of building Canada's first Olympic equestrian team, made the Mann logo the most widely used emblem for Canada's international equestrians across all disciplines and all organizations, and made \"Canadian Equestrian Team\" a unifying term over a fragmented and constantly changing horse sport system.\nOlympic Debut.\nAfter the end of the CES, the Canadian Horse Shows Association (CHSA) provided bridging funding to CET athletes, until Major LJ McGuinness founded the Canadian Olympic Equestrian Team (COET) in 1951, to manage Canada's first participation in the Olympic equestrian events. The COET was largely run by the athletes themselves and their immediate supporters: Major McGuinness also captained and rode for the Canadian eventing team at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics.\nIt was not until 1959 that a formal Canadian Olympic Equestrian Committee (COEC) corporation was created, with RH Rough serving as its first Executive Director. Since then, there has been a steady expansion in the number and the scale of professional organizations responsible for different CET disciplines.\nThe CET won its first Olympic medal in 1956, a team bronze in eventing. It won its first Olympic gold medal in 1968, a team gold in jumping. It won its first team World Championship in 1970, by its team at the FEI Jumping World Championship.\nAchievements.\nThe CET achieved its greatest success to date in 2010, when Canada was frequently described as one of the top three equestrian nations.\nAt that time, CET athletes simultaneously held six separate World, Olympic, and Paralympic championships: the FEI Reining World Championship (Duane Latimer and Hang Ten Surprise); the FEI Tent Pegging World Championship (Akaash Maharaj and Gagan); the PRCA Steer Wrestling World Championship (Lee Graves); the WCJA Jousting World Championship (Shane Adams and Dragon); the IOC Jumping Olympic Championship (Eric Lamaze and Hickstead); and the IPC Dressage II Freestyle Paralympic Championship (Lauren Barwick and Maile).\nCET Governing Bodies.\nThere are currently fifteen independent national governing bodies in Canada governing CET athletes in international competitions. The three largest are Equine Canada for the Olympic and Paralympic teams, the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association for rodeo and western riding teams, and Polo Canada for the Canadian polo team."

        "text": "Bosworth Tennis, also known as Bosworth International, is a family business which specializes in stringing tennis rackets but also designs and alters other aspects of tennis rackets to match the personal preferences of the players. They have worked with many of the top tennis players, notably Ivan Lendl. The company was created by Warren Bosworth in 1975. By 1992 his business moved from Glastonbury, Connecticut, to Boca Raton. It is now led by his son Jay Bosworth, who joined the company in 1982. It is one of a handful of highly specialized companies catering to the top professional players, compabarable to Roman Prokes (Maria Sharapova, Andy Roddick) and Nate Ferguson (Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic), but they also provide similar services to amateur players.\nWarren M. Bosworth Jr. (January 5, 1935 – July 7, 2010) was born in Providence, Rhode Island. After his studies of embalmment at the New England Institute of Anatomy, Warren Bosworth had many jobs, including embalmer at his father's Warren M. Bosworth Funeral Home, and investment banker, before starting around 1970 a company that maintained tennis court surfaces. He married Barbara Bedard in 1959. They lived with their three children in Hartford, Connecticut.\nAfter he had bought and adapted a stringing machine in 1972, he was asked to redesign the stringing machine at Ektelon Corp. He started working for the Aetna World Cup tournament in Hartford, and by 1976 became the Floor General there, responsible for the stringing, the grounds and the ball courts. In 1975, he was so well known as a stringer and qualified pro trainer that he retired from the investment banking and became a full-time stringer, touring the circuit with his Bosworth Racket Clinic. Most famous collaboration is the one with Lendl. Roscoe Tanner claims his streak at the US Open in 79 (including wins against Lendl and Borg) was caused by Bosworth adjusting his rackets. Working with many of the top professional players, he was nicknamed \"The Wizard of Boz\" and \"The Doctor\".\nHe also worked as chief technical consultant for Snauwaert. In 1980, he designed his first full racket, the Snauwaert Dyno. His second design was a racket for Jimmy Connors. Warren Bosworth also invented new stringing patterns like the Bosworth Pattern, perfect squares surrounded by rectangles."

He was selected as one of Parramatta's reserves in the 1981 NSWRFL season's grand final, in which they defeated Newtown to claim their maiden premiership.\nSharp was selected to play for the Eels at second-row forward in the 1982 NSWRFL season's grand final victory over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. At the end of the 1983 NSWRFL season Parramatta again faced Manly in the grand final and again Sharp played at second-row forward in the Eels victory, making it three consecutive premierships for the club. He was selected to play for the Eels as a reserve in the 1984 NSWRL season's grand final which was lost to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nWhen the newly-build Parramatta Stadium hosted its first match in 1986, Sharp scored the first try there. The 1990 NSWRL season was his last in first grade.\nPost playing.\nIn May 2013 Sharp was elected Chairman of the Parramatta Eels board, replacing Roy Spagnolo. In 2016, Parramatta were involved in a salary cap scandal where it was revealed that secret payments to players had been made and that the club had been over the cap since 2013. Sharp along with what the media dubbed \"The gang of five\" were deregistered by The NRL in the fallout of the scandal.\nIn August 2016, Sharp spoke to the media saying \"I'm totally disappointed in the NRL's decision in finding me guilty of being part of a system that defrauded the salary cap, That never happened, but I have to live by the decisions of the NRL,I'm not saying it didn't occur I'm saying that I didn't have the knowledge at the time that this stuff was happening,I don't apologise for something I wasn't aware of, I've lost the love of the game over the last 18 months, I still love Parramatta and I care about the club but I've lost the love of the game, and going back to my earliest memory, I've always had it.

The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup, usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase, and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nSouth Africa have appeared in the FIFA World Cup on three occasions in 1998, 2002, and 2010.\nAlthough South Africa has made three appearances in the World Cup, they have not made it past the first round. The team's first attempt to qualify was for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The team finished second in their group, behind Nigeria, who went on to play at the World Cup. Their first appearance was in France 1998, six years after they had been readmitted to the global football family. Despite a 3–0 drubbing to France in their opening game, they went on to draw against Denmark and Saudi Arabia, the team finished third and thus exited the tournament. Korea/Japan 2002 was expected to be an opportunity for Bafana Bafana to step up to the next level but they were eliminated at the group stage despite drawing to Paraguay and beating Slovenia 1–0 for their first-ever World Cup win. The team finished third in their group, losing out to Paraguay on goals scored. The team failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup after finishing third in their qualifying group. Ghana won the group and progressed to the tournament, while Congo DR finished ahead of South Africa on head-to-head results. During the 2010 World Cup on their home soil, they beat France 2–1 and drew 1–1 to Mexico, but lost 0–3 to Uruguay. They lost out on progression to the round of 16, on goal difference, becoming the first World Cup host nation to fail to advance past the group stage.\nFrance 1998.\nHead coach: Philippe Troussier\nSouth Africa vs Denmark.\nBenni McCarthy scored South Africa's first ever goal in the World Cup when he received the ball on the edge of the penalty box before shooting low left footed through the legs of Peter Schmeichel to level the match.\nKorea/Japan 2002.\nHead coach: Jomo Sono\nSouth Africa vs Slovenia.\nSiyabonga Nomvethe scored the only goal of the game, in the fourth minute. A free kick from Quinton Fortune on the left came to Nomvethe and although he mistimed his header, the ball cannoned into the net off his thigh.\nSouth Africa 2010.\nCoach: Carlos Alberto Parreira\nSouth Africa vs Mexico.\nSouth Africa vs Mexico was the opening match of the World Cup, held on 11 June 2010. It was described as an \"enthralling\" and \"pulsating\" match. South Africa opened the scoring in the 55th minute after Siphiwe Tshabalala scored off a pass through Mexico's defence by Teko Modise. Mexico's captain Rafael Márquez equalised following a corner kick in the 79th minute. In the final minutes of the match, Katlego Mphela almost scored a winning goal for South Africa, but his shot bounced off the post.\nTshabalala was named as the man of the match. South Africa's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira called the result \"fair\", while Mexico's coach Javier Aguirre stated \"we could have won, we could have lost\".\nFrance vs South Africa.\nTwo teams have met three times but recently in the 1998 FIFA World Cup won by France 30.\nBongani Khumalo scored the first goal to make it 10 in 25th minute Yoann Gourcuff was shown a red card after a serious foul, Katlego Mphela made it 20 in half-time, South Africa made several chances in second half, Hugo Lloris saved Katlego Mphela's shot to make a third goal, Bacary Sagna made a back pass to the French player Florent Malouda scored a goal to make it 21 from an assist by Franck Ribéry, South Africa made even more chances in second half, 2-1 was the final score of the match.

        "text": "The final draw for the 2014 FIFA World Cup took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe Resort, Mata de São João in Bahia, at 13:00 local time (). The ceremony determined the group in which the 32 participating teams would begin the final tournament. The teams were divided in advance by FIFA into four pots based on seedings and geographic regions.\nSeeding.\nSeeding for the draw was based on the October 2013 version of the FIFA World Ranking. Although the November 2013 rankings were the most current at the time of the final draw, the usage of those rankings would advantage those teams who had played additional play-off matches in order to qualify. Brazil were not among the top eight seeded teams at the time but, in keeping with usual FIFA World Cup procedure, were seeded by virtue of being the host nation. The top seven teams in the October 2013 FIFA World Ranking filled the remaining seeded positions.\nThe draw.\nIn preparation for the final draw, the 32 participating teams were put into four pots based on seedings and geographic regions. It was announced in October 2013 that the eight seeded teams to feature in Pot 1 would consist of the host nation Brazil and the seven highest-ranked teams as of that month's FIFA World Rankings (see above). Following a meeting of the competition's organizing committee on 3 December, the composition of the other three pots was announced:\nThe draw procedure was as follows:\nFrance seeding controversy.\nThere was some controversy before the draw, which some called potgate, when FIFA decided that the European team in Pot 2 would be drawn there randomly. Previously, the lowest-ranked European team was sent there. In this case, that would have been France, who would otherwise have got the draw that occurred for Italy.\nMany officials, fans and journalists complained, pointing out that a Frenchman, the FIFA secretary-general Jérôme Valcke, suggested the change, and suspecting that another influential Frenchman, UEFA's president, Michel Platini, helped approve it."

It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775."

The similarities between the two clubs' names has been known to create confusion for visiting golfers but once visitors are redirected to the club on Cravells Road they can expect a warm welcome. After a major revision to the course in 1996, the golf course consists of eleven holes on the original common and seven new holes on private land in an area known as the Jockey Field.\nNotable Members.\nThe club's most famous member is Ken Brown who joined as a junior member in 1969 and also worked as a green keeper at the club. Ken acknowledged his attachment to the club during his professional playing career. Ken frequently discusses goings on at '\"the Common\"' during his BBC commentary at major golf tournaments. Ken was recently joined by the mayors of Harpenden and St Albans in May 2013 when he officially opened the newly developed clubhouse.\nThe Golf Course.\nThe golf course is partly based on Harpenden Common and partly on private land owned by the Club (known as the Jockey Field. The holes in the Jockey Field were added in 1996 and were designed by club member and Ryder Cup player Ken Brown. At the same time some of the holes on the Common were amended and lengthened. Some of the original holes on the Common which are no longer used as part of the course now provide excellent practice facilities for the members of the club and visitors.\nThe golf course at Harpenden Common Golf Club has a number of interesting or unusual features:\nThe Club is private though guests are allowed at most times, subject to course availability; a handicap certificate may be requested in order to establish proficiency.\nThe golf course has three tees – \"Ladies\" (red tees), \"Visitors\" (yellow tees) and \"Medal\" (white tees).\nCurrent Layout.\nMen's card (since 1996)\nThe course record for the current golf course layout is 63 and is held by Sam Claridge.\nLadies' card (since 1996)\nHertfordshire County Honours.\nHarpenden Common Golf Club has frequently produced good amateur players who have performed well at the County level.\nSource:"

Many outside of the Duke fan base have speculated Coach K used the injury excuse as a way to back out of a terrible team and saddle the hardship of the season on an assistant coach.\nAssistant Pete Gaudet would finish the rest of the Blue Devils' disappointing season with an overall record of 13–18, marking the first time since the 1982–83 season that they failed to finish above .500, won fewer than twenty games, and missed the NCAA tournament. The eighteen losses still stand as the most ever in a single season by a Duke team.

        "title": "Climbing and falling film plate evaporator",
        "text": "A climbing/falling film plate evaporator is a specialized type of evaporator in which a thin film of liquid is passed over a rising and falling plate to allow the evaporation process to occur. It is an extension of the falling film evaporator, and has application in any field where the liquid to be evaporated cannot withstand extended exposure to high temperatures, such as the concentration of fruit juices.\nDesign.\nThe basic design of the climbing/falling film plate evaporator consists of two phases. In the climbing phase, the liquid feed is heated by a flow of steam as it rises through a corrugated plate. In the subsequent falling phase, the liquid flows downward at high velocity under gravitational force. Evaporation and cooling occurs rapidly in the falling phase.\nThere are several design variations that are commonly used in industrial field. These include single-effect and multiple-effect evaporators. The choice of evaporator design is dictated by constraints of the process. Fundamentally, there are four factors involved in designing this evaporator: \nThe main advantage of climbing/falling film plate evaporator is its short residence time. Since the liquid feed does not remain in the evaporator for long, this evaporator is suitable for heat/temperature sensitive material. Thus, this evaporator is used widely in food, beverages and pharmaceutical industries. Besides that, the colour, texture, nutritional content and taste of the liquid feed can be preserved too. Despite its functionality, this evaporator has a few drawbacks such as large energy consumption. Future development compromises installing large number of steam effects and recycle the steam where possible for better energy efficiency.\nDesigns available.\nClimbing/falling film plate evaporator designs can be group into single-effect and multiple-effect film plate designs.\nSingle-effect.\nThe operations for single-effect evaporator can be carried out in a batch, semi-batch, or continuous- batch or continuously. Single-effect evaporators are indicated in any of the following conditions:\nThermocompression.\nThermocompression is useful whenever evaporator energy requirements need to be reduced. This could be achieved by compressing and recycling the vapor from a single-effects evaporator into the same evaporator as the heating medium. Thermocompression of vapor can be achieved by applying the steam-jet or by using mechanical means such as compressors\nMultiple-effect evaporators.\nThe best way to reduce energy consumption is by using multiple-effect evaporators. For multiple-effect evaporators, the steam from outside is condensed by the heating element of the first effect and the vapors produced from the first effect are then recycled back to the second effect, where the feed will be partially concentrated product of the first effect. The process expands until the last effect when the final desired concentration is achieved.\nProcess characteristics.\nThere are several process characteristics that should be taken into account in order for the evaporator to operate at its best performance.\nEvaporation of thin liquid film.\nEvaporation of liquid film in film evaporators is very important in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced at the bottom of the tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.\nHeat transfer characteristic.\nThe heat transfer performance of the climbing and falling film plate evaporator is affected by several factors, including the height of the feed inside the tube and the temperature difference. The height of the feed water is inversely related to the climbing film height. The low height of feed water will lead to the high height of climbing film. Higher height of the climbing film will increase the percentage of saturated flow boiling region therefore it will lead to an increase in the local heat transfer coefficient. The optimum height ratio of feed water is found to be . Any height ratio less than 0.3 will cause the local heat transfer coefficient to decrease. Besides that, small liquid content in the tube can minimize the foaming problem.\nThe combination of climbing and falling film evaporator allows the evaporator to operate within a wide temperature range. The evaporators can operate in a small temperature difference between the heating medium and the liquid. This is due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure drop in the evaporator. The lack of hydrostatic pressure drop will eliminate the temperature drop thus causing the temperature to be relatively uniform. Besides that, the local heat transfer coefficient inside the tube is depending on the change in temperature. A minimum threshold of change in temperature (\"ΔT\") of 5 °C was found by Luopeng Yang in one of his experiments. If the change in temperature is less than 5 °C, the liquid film will not be able to travel up the tubes which resulting in a drop of local heat transfer coefficient in the tube.\nResidence time.\nSince the evaporator is mainly used in processes dealing with heat-sensitive materials, the residence time should be kept as low as possible. Residence time is the time taken for the product to be in contact with heat. To improve the product quality, short heat contact period from single pass operation can minimize product deterioration. The climbing and falling film plate evaporator is capable of satisfying this requirement. Short residence time can be achieved by higher liquid flow rates down the tube in the falling film evaporator. The effect of gravitational force will increase the flow rate of the liquid resulting in the short residence time.\nApplication of design guidelines.\nPrevention of nucleate boiling.\nIn designing a film plate evaporator, the use of superheated liquid needs to be controlled in order to prevent nucleate boiling. Nucleate boiling will cause product deterioration resulting from increases in chemical reaction rates that come from the raise in temperature. Nucleate boiling will cause fouling to occur, thus affecting the rate of heat transfer of the process. In order to avoid nucleate boiling, the liquid superheat should be in the range of 3 to 40 K depending on the liquid used.\nShort residence time.\nMinimizing residence time is important in order to minimize the occurrence of chemical reactions between the feed and the evaporator materials, thus reducing fouling within the evaporator. This guideline is especially important in the food processing industry, where purity of output product is paramount. In this application, residence time bears directly on product quality, thus it is important for the climbing and falling film plate evaporator to have low residence time.\nWaste stream production.\nCondensate is the waste that had been discharged through waste stream in climbing and falling-film evaporator. This evaporator will discharge vapor as the condensate as vapor pass through more rapidly than the liquid flows in the tube.\nIn each evaporation unit, the feed enter from the bottom of tubesheet of pass through the climbing and falling film segment. When the liquid rises throughout the tube, boiling and vaporization process occurred as it is contact with the steam heated plates. Then the mixture that contains liquid and vapour are discharged and it is reallocated at the top of falling film pass tubes. The vapour that produced by climbing film is used to increase the velocity of liquid in the distribution liquid tubes in order to rise up the heat transfer. External separator is used to separate the mixture of both liquid and water that produced at the down-flow.\nPost-treatment.\nIn a multi-effect evaporator, the vapor output of one phase of the evaporator is recycled as the heating medium for the next phase, reducing the overall consumption of steam for the evaporator.\nA surface condenser is used to condense the vapor that produced in the second effect process. In order to recover the heat that had been used in this evaporator, both of the vapor condensate is pumped to the pre-heater feed so that it can produce heat to this process.\nRange of applications.\nClimbing/falling film plate evaporators are used in a range of applications:\nFruit juice concentration.\nFruit juices are condensed by evaporation for storage, transport and commercial use. If fruit juices are exposed to heat, the nutrient content such as vitamin C may be affected. Furthermore, these nutrients are easily oxidized at high temperature. The evaporator can overcome this constraint as it operates at high feed flow rate and small temperature difference. In addition, the change in color and texture of the juices can be prevented via the operation of this evaporator type.\nDairy industry.\nOther protein-rich products such as whey powder in dietary supplement and milk (including both skim and whole milk) are concentrated to remove most liquid components for further processes. Protein is easily denatured at high temperature because its tertiary structure is degraded upon exposure to heat. Evaporation via climbing and falling film plate design can minimize the effect of protein denaturation and thus, optimizing the product quality.\nOther food industry applications.\nInstant and concentrated cooking ingredients such as pasta sauce, chicken broth, vegetable purees etc. undergo evaporation through the same evaporating equipment. Although they are relatively less sensitive to heat, evaporating them at low temperature and short residence time is crucial to maintain the quality taste, texture appearance and nutritional value.\nPharmaceuticals.\nAntibiotics, supplementary pills and drugs containing organic and inorganic compounds are evaporated to remove as much moisture as possible for crystallization. This is because in crystallized form, antibiotics and enzyme compounds will be well preserved and improved in stability. Moreover, exposure to high temperature will lead to decomposition of inorganic compounds. Although most pharmaceutical products are extremely sensitive in temperature, this type of evaporator is still practical to be used since several design of this evaporators are able to operate at low pressure since the boiling point of water is low as pressure decreases.\nLimitations.\nThere are few limitations of this evaporator that makes it not applicable for all range of industrial processes. The evaporator needs to be operated within the range of 26–100 °C and is able to remove water in a range of 450–16,000 kg/h. In order to provide the proper rising/falling characteristics, most evaporators are quite tall and can only be installed in a space that is high. The suspended solid in the liquid feed need to be low and can pass through 50 mesh screen.\nDevelopment.\nThere are several problems related to climbing and falling film plate evaporators. One of them is the energy intensive system. In order to improve the productivity of the plant, the energy consumption needs to be reduced with the intention of reducing the use of steam. New strategies had been proposed by investigator to reduce the utilization of steam to improve the system of economic steam. The examples of operating strategies are flashing of feed, product and condensate, splitting of feed and steam and use of optimum feed flow series.\nSeveral techniques have been suggested to minimize energy consumption:"

        "text": "The Old Dominion Monarchs field hockey team (formerly the Lady Monarchs) represents Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. The team currently competes as a Big East Conference affiliate of NCAA Division I field hockey.\nHistory.\nThe Old Dominion field hockey program initiated as the Norfolk Division Braves of the College of William &amp; Mary in 1930, competing with local high school clubs and trade schools prior to its independence. Once the independent Old Dominion College was established after governor Albertis Harrison dissolved the William &amp; Mary college system in 1962, the field hockey program began competitions with other local, independent college clubs.\nCompetitions expanded past the local level after the hiring of head coach Beth Anders in the early 1980s. Under her 30-season tenure as head coach, the Monarchs achieved nine NCAA tournament championship titles, producing six Honda Sports Award winners and 17 competitors in the Olympic Games. Anders helped the U.S. field hockey team win bronze in the 1984 Summer Olympics, won 12 CAA Coach of the Year awards, and was the winningest coach in NCAA history upon her retirement. The Monarchs hired former Canadian forward Andrew Griffiths following Anders' departure. Griffiths remains as ODU's head coach as of the 2023 season.\nThe Monarchs previously competed in the Colonial Athletic Association from 1991 to 2012 prior to Old Dominion's move to the FBS. While Conference USA served as ODU's primary conference starting in 2013, they did not sponsor field hockey as a sport.

        "text": "George Gothard Aitken (2 July 1898 – 8 July 1952) was a rugby union footballer who represented New Zealand – known as the All Blacks – and then Scotland. He was born in Westport, New Zealand, and was selected to play provincially for Buller at the age of 16. After moving to Wellington, Aitken played for the province from 1917, and from there was selected for the All Blacks side that faced South Africa when they toured New Zealand in 1921. After only two Test matches for the All Blacks, both as captain, he was dropped from the team. In 1922 Aitken was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and travelled to England to study at the University of Oxford. He played for the university's rugby club, and from there he was selected for Scotland. He first represented the country in 1924, and in 1925 appeared in all of their Five Nations matches; Scotland won all four of those games, and in doing so achieved their first ever Grand Slam.\nEarly life and rugby career.\nAitken was born in Westport in 1898, and was educated at Westport District High School. He played rugby at centre, and was selected for Buller as a 16-year-old – playing for them in 1914 and 1915. He moved to Wellington to attend Victoria University College (now Victoria University) where he played for the Victoria University club. In 1917 he was selected for the Wellington – that season representatives were restricted to players under military age due to the First World War. He continued to represent the province in the following seasons, and in 1919 Wellington resumed Ranfurly Shield matches; Wellington had won the Shield off Taranaki in 1914, but had not defended it at all due to the War. Aitken played in twelve Ranfurly Shield defences during his career.\nAitken continued to play for Wellington in 1920 – the province had a very strong team – when the side included a number of All Blacks. He was selected for New Zealand Universities when they faced the touring Sydney University team; Aitken played in both matches between the sides; the first was won 17–6 by New Zealand, and the second won 11–8 by Sydney University.\nAll Blacks.\nThe 1921 season was Aitken's most significant while in New Zealand. He was selected for the North Island side in the annual Inter-Island match, which was won by the North 28–13. For the second season he was selected for the New Zealand University team that played both Wellington and New South Wales. South Africa were touring New Zealand for the first time that year, and their itinerary included a three-Test series against the All Blacks. Aitken was selected at centre for the first Test match, and was surprisingly selected as captain, despite not having played for his country before, and never leading his province. He was described by rugby writer Winston McCarthy as \"a beautiful mover of the ball who had the number one attribute of a good centre, to run his wings into position\". The Test was at Carisbrook, Dunedin, in front of 25,000 spectators, and the game started well for the South Africans, who scored the first try, and led 5–0 at half-time. The New Zealanders responded with three tries in the second half to win 13–5.\nThe second Test was in Auckland; the All Black selectors made only three changes, and Aitken was again selected as captain and at centre. A crowd of 40,000 watched the two sides contest a close game; the scores were tied 5–5 until a late drop-goal from Springbok Gerhard Morkel (worth four points at the time), gave the South Africans a 9–5 victory. Aitken's form in the match was poor, however he had been ill with the flu leading up to the game. Consequently, for the third and deciding Test Aitken was dropped, and replaced as captain by Teddy Roberts, and at centre by Mark Nicholls. Aitken's dropping as a captain and a player was viewed as harsh, and he never played for New Zealand again, thereby becoming one of the few players to captain the All Blacks in every match they played.\nScotland.\nThe following year Aitken was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University in England. His last match in New Zealand was played on 9 August 1922. The match was a mid-week Ranfurly Shield challenge between Hawke's Bay and the holders Wellington. Aitken was in the strong Wellington side, who were expected to easily defeat the challengers. However Hawke's Bay upset Aitken's side 19–9, and went on to hold the Ranfurly Shield for five years.\nAfter moving to England, Aitken played for Oxford Rugby Football Club, and was awarded a Blue for the University. He played one game for Leicester Tigers in 1923. He was eventually selected for Scotland, and played eight Tests for them between 1924 and 1929. The Scottish side included an all-Oxford University three-quarters; the other three were George MacPherson, Ian Smith, and Johnnie Wallace. In 1925 Scotland won their first ever Five Nations (now Six Nations) Grand Slam – victory over all four of their Five Nations opponents.\nAfter graduating from Oxford, Aitken went into business in England. He later returned in New Zealand in 1939, where he worked for Department of Industries and Commerce. He died on 8 July 1952 in Wellington."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in India in 2013–14",
        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured India, playing two Test matches and a three-match One Day International series against the Indian national team from 31 October to 27 November 2013. The series, not initially in the ICC Future Tours Programme, was hastily arranged by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) following the postponement of India's scheduled tour to South Africa to December, with that series itself reduced to 2 Tests and 3 ODIs due to a spat between the BCCI and Cricket South Africa.\nThe series was notable for Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's retirement from all forms of the game at the conclusion of the second Test, which was his 200th overall.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nDebuting in the international Test series, Mohammed Shami took 4 wickets giving 71 runs off 17 overs he bowled in the first innings. In second innings he took 5 wickets giving 47 runs of 13.1 overs. This performance was compared with the best score by a medium-paced Indian bowler Syed Abid Ali who took 6 wickets giving 55 runs off 17 overs against Australia in 1967. Rohit Sharma also debuted in Test match with this match and scored the highest runs of 177 and marked his first century in the format.\nBeing the 199th Test match of Tendulkar and his last at Eden Gardens, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) celebrated the event in a grand scale. A music album launched dedicated to his achievements was played at various intersections in the city of Kolkata when he arrived. The stadium displayed a life-size wax statue of Tendulkar and a cake of 199 Shôndeshs and 199 tricolour balloons were released. On 8 November, around 2000 students in Alathur, Palakkad district, Kerala donned Tendulkar masks to pay tribute to him.\nSecond Test.\nTendulkar's retirement.\nIn October 2013, Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar declared he would retire from Tests and all other forms of cricket after playing the second Test against the West Indies. He had retired from ODIs in December 2012, and from the Twenty20 format in October 2013, after he played the 2013 Champions League Twenty20, where his team Mumbai Indians took the winner's trophy. The match would be Tendulkar's 200th Test match. On his request, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) agreed to schedule the match at Wankhede Stadium, his home ground in Mumbai.\nMumbai Cricket Association (MCA), the governing body for cricket in Mumbai and its surrounding regions, planned various events in honour of Tendulkar's retirement. Sharad Pawar, the president of the MCA, called it the \"end of a golden era\". On 11 November, MCA named the Association's ground at Mahavir Nagar, Kandivali in North Mumbai as \"Sachin Tendulkar Gymkhana Club\". The stadium had cutouts displaying various events from Tendulkar's career, and each ticket had his photograph and listed his 51 Test centuries. The online ticket booking for the match started from 11 November on Kyazoonga.com, and crashed multiple times due to high traffic. The online travel agency Musafir.com arranged 200 taxis to connect from various locations in Mumbai to the stadium for free for the match. On 12 November, \"India Today\" organized a day-long \"Salaam Sachin Conclave\" where various cricketers, celebrities of Bollywood, politicians and others spoke about him.\nDay 1.\nThe match started with a toss of special gold coin flipped by the Indian captain M. S. Dhoni, winning the toss and choosing to bowl. The special golden coin had Tendulkar's image inscribed on one side and MCA's logo on other. The token coin was then presented to Tendulkar as a memento. 1000 more replicas were presented to dignitaries. The Union Minister of India, Kapil Sibal then unveiled Tendulkar's postal stamp. Tendulkar became the second Indian after Mother Teresa to have such stamp released in their lifetime.\nWest Indies were bowled out for 182 from 55.2 overs. Kieran Powell scored the highest with 48 runs. Indian left-arm orthodox spinner Pragyan Ojha took the maximum of 5 wickets. At the end of the inning, captain and wicketkeeper Dhoni completed 251 dismissals by a wicketkeeper and became 7th to do so in the history. Indian right-arm off-break bowler Ravichandran Ashwin took his 100th Test wicket with captain Darren Sammy and became the 5th fastest in the history to do so in 18 Test matches. India's batting started with Murali Vijay scoring the highest of 43 runs for the day. At the loss of two wickets and Tendulkar (38) and Cheteshwar Pujara (34) batting, the day ended with 157 total runs by Indian team.\nDay 2.\nContinuing ahead, Tendulkar and Pujara reached 74 and 113 respectively. Tendulkar recorded his 68th Test 50, but was dismissed for 74, missing his 101st International century. Rohit Sharma finished on 111 not out, his second consecutive century. By the end of day two, India led by 313 runs with a total score of 495. Shane Shillingford recorded fifth consecutive five-for in five innings, nearing the record of six consecutive five-fors set by Charlie Turner in 1888. The day ended with West Indies on 43 with loss of 3 wickets.\nDay 3.\nWest Indies started on their chase from previous day's score of 43 but wound up all out at 187. India won the game by an innings and 126 runs and thus the over all Test series as 2–0. Ojha again took the highest of 5 wickets in this inning. Tendulkar in his emotional speech thanked various personalities of his life along with the audience. In return, the crowd screamed \"Thank you\". The hashtags like #ThankYouSachin, #SachinSachin and #SRT200 trended on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook."

On a cruise ship or ocean liner, the lido deck features outdoor pools and related facilities.\nThe term probably made its way into English via \"Lansbury's Lido\", a nickname used in the British press for London's Serpentine bathing place. The bathing place was revamped in 1930 as a project of the Labour First Commissioner for Works, George Lansbury, a plaque to whom appears on the Serpentine pavilion to this day. The re-opening garnered significant press attention as a result of Lansbury's introduction of \"mixed\" bathing. \"Lido\", an Italian word for \"beach\", forms part of the place names of several Italian seaside towns known for their beaches, such as Lido di Venezia, the barrier beach enclosing the Venetian Lagoon. Like the Lido di Venezia, the Serpentine \"Lido\" includes an extended area of shoreline. The nickname \"Lansbury's Lido\" was probably also ironic, given the contrast between the glamour of Venice and the relative squalor of interwar London — not to mention the latter's variable weather.\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources"

        "text": "Sale FC is a semi-professional rugby union club based at Heywood Road in Sale, Greater Manchester, England. They play in National League 1 following promotion from National League 2 North at the end of the 2017–18 season. Premiership club Sale Sharks is the professional offshoot of Sale FC.\nHistory.\nFormed by a team of sportsmen drawn mainly from Sale Cricket Club, Sale Football Club was founded in 1861 and is the fifth oldest surviving rugby club. In the early days of the club, rules were usually deemed unnecessary and those that were enforced were often made up on the spot. As the game began to evolve, however, the need for specified regulations became apparent and in 1865 the Minute Book was created stipulating the ten rules to be followed by all players. This is reputedly world's oldest existing rugby rule book and a much treasured possession. Games were originally played on either a rented portion of Sale Cricket Club or on fields owned by local farmers. In 1905, the club bought a field at the end of Heywood Road.\nSale FC have featured many prominent international and county players. Pat Davies became their first England international in 1927 and the 1930s saw an international backline of Hal Sever (England wing), Claude Davey and Wilf Wooller (Wales centres) and Ken Fyfe (Scotland wing). Fran Cotton, Steve Smith, Dewi Morris, Richard Trickey and Jason Robinson also played at Sale.Eric Evans played for and captained England as hooker.For many years there was an Eric Evans Stand.\nIn 1936, Sale were invited to take part in the Middlesex Sevens Cup and went on to win the competition.\nBefore World War II, an increase in membership meant that the club had almost outgrown facilities at Heywood Road and an additional site on Woodbourne Road was purchased. Initially this was meant to be a training ground for the junior team, but there were talks to eventually relocate the rest of the club there too, but when war was over it was instead decided to focus efforts on the redevelopment of Heywood Road. Land was sold to fund the project and the ground gradually began to evolve. A new clubhouse was built, the old bath house replaced by squash courts, changing facilities improved, floodlights installed and the commemorative Jim Birtles Stand erected.\nFacilities.\nIn December 2017 at their home game against Sedgley Tigers, Sale FC opened their Suite @Sale hospitality suite. This new suite overlooking the main pitch with sliding windows onto the balcony, seats 190 for meals in the main room, 24 people in the Executive Suite and has two bars. There is also a bar downstairs named after Steve Smith \"Smithys\". The new development includes a new gymnasium and a Martial Arts facility used by TaeKwonDo.\nTraining ground.\nSale FC Rugby also own the Sale FC Rugby Training ground on Carrington Lane. This high performance facility has four pitches, one of which is floodlit and a training resource area including dining room, performance analysis suite and it is also where Minis and Juniors train on Sunday mornings and Thursday evenings. This is also the home venue for Sale FC 1861, Sale FC Vikings and Sale FC Senior Colts.\nThe gymnasium provides rehab, strength and condition facilities and changing rooms. Recently the club house has had a complete refurbish and now contains a bar and a cafe. \nMascot.\nOn 23 December 2017 the club unveiled a new mascot, Trickey the Mutt.\nTeams.\nSale FC currently has four senior teams\nSale FC also has\nTouch Rugby.\nIn the 2022–23 season, Sale FC have added a touch rugby team to their club. Manchester Chargers in the search for a new home have joined forces with Sale FC to form Sale FC Chargers. Home games and training are at Sale FC Training Centre Carrington Lane.\nHonours.\nOld amateur club (pre Sale Sharks)\nModern amateur club (post Sale Sharks)"
