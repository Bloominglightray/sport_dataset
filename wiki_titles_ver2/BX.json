        "title": "Joe Glenn (American football)",
        "text": "Joseph Cassidy Glenn (born March 7, 1949) is a former American football coach and former player. He was the head football coach at the University of South Dakota, his alma mater, from 2012 to 2015. He was named head coach on December 5, 2011, after the school's athletic director, David Sayler, fired Ed Meierkort. Glenn served as the head football coach at Doane College (1976–1979), the University of Northern Colorado (1989–1999), the University of Montana (2000–2002), and the University of Wyoming (2003–2008). He won two NCAA Division II Football Championships at Northern Colorado, in 1996 and 1997, and an NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship at Montana in 2001.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nGlenn served as backfield coach at the University of South Dakota in 1974. He was also a backfield coach at Northern Arizona University in 1975.\nGlenn's first head coaching job was at Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. There he was the youngest head college football coach at 27 years of age. While at Doane he compiled a 21–18–1 record over four seasons. After Doane, Glenn made his first stint at the University of Montana as a quarterbacks and wide receivers coach and offensive coordinator from 1980 to 1985. He was out of coaching in 1986. In 1987, he joined the staff at University of Northern Colorado (UNC) as quarterbacks and kicking coach. He was named head coach of UNC for the 1989 season.\nPrior to coaching at Montana, Glenn led the Division II University of Northern Colorado to two NCAA Division II Football Championships in 1996 and 1997. Glenn spent eleven seasons at UNC, with a 98–35 record.\nMontana.\nGlenn coached at Montana for three seasons, from 2000 to 2002, and compiled a 39–6 record. In 2001, the Grizzlies won the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship, defeating Furman in the title game. The year before, the Grizzlies finished as the NCAA Division I-AA runner-up, losing to Georgia Southern in the championship game. In 2002, Montana finished in the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs.\nWyoming.\nOver a three-year period, Glenn and his staff took a team that won only five games in the three previous seasons to a Las Vegas Bowl win in two seasons. The 24–21 victory over UCLA on December 23, 2004, marked the first bowl appearance for Wyoming in 11 years and their first bowl victory in 38 years. In 2005, after starting 4–1, including a victory over the Ole Miss, the Cowboys went on a six-game losing skid, finishing 4–7.\nThe 2006 season was one which saw the Cowboys picked to finish last in the conference. After an opening day victory over Utah State, the Cowboys suffered four losses, two of them in overtime. Then the Cowboys fortunes began to shift. The team enjoyed a four-game winning streak, all against conference opponents. The Cowboys next two games were both road losses, the first against TCU, in which they managed only a field goal. The next game was on the road against than #25 BYU. The Cougars trounced the Cowboys, 55–7. The Cowboys fell to 5–6. The Cowboys won their final game against UNLV, moving them to a 6–6 record, and making them bowl eligible but the team did not receive an invitation.\nThe 2007 Cowboys season started off with a 23–3 victory over Atlantic Coast Conference-member Virginia. By the end of October, Wyoming was 5–3 and needed only one win in its last four games to become bowl-eligible. However, the Cowboys lost all four games to finish 5–7, including a 50–0 thrashing at the hands of Utah on November 10.\nOffensive coordinator Billy Cockhill was fired at the end of the 2007 season and replaced by Bob Cole, formerly of Florida A&amp;M in an attempt to improve the Cowboy's anemic offense. Junior college signal caller Dax Crum came to the Laramie campus from the Mesa Community College in Arizona to compete for the starting quarterback job, which he won over junior Karsten Sween.\nThe 2008 Cowboys opened the season with a win over Mid-American Conference-member 2008 Ohio Bobcats football team (21-20), a loss to Air Force (23-3) and a win over FCS North Dakota State (16–13). Wyoming followed up that victory with five straight losses: to BYU (44–0), Bowling Green (45–16), New Mexico (24–0), Utah (40-7), and TCU (54–7). On November 1, the Pokes beat San Diego State, 35–10, at home and then followed with a win over Tennessee, 13–7, on the road a week later. Five days later, on Thursday, Wyoming lost to UNLV, 22–14, on the road. Wyoming finished the season by losing to arch rival Colorado State, 31–20, at home in the 100th Border War. The following day, November 23, 2008, Glenn was fired. Glenn finished his career at Wyoming with an overall record of 30–41 (.423), and 15–31 (.326) versus Mountain West opponents.\nGlenn joined the Mtn. as a game-day analyst in 2009. In 2010, he left the Mtn. and joined the WAC Sports Network as a color commentator.\nSouth Dakota.\nGlenn was named USD's 29th head football coach on December 5, 2011. Glenn started coaching the Coyotes during the 2012 season as they started their first season as a full-fledged member in Division I-FCS football, competing in the Missouri Valley Football Conference.\nControversy.\nDuring the week before their game against Utah in 2007, Glenn \"guaranteed\" a victory at a luncheon for University of Wyoming students. However, this ended up motivating Utah as they beat Wyoming that day, 50–0. In the third quarter, with the Utes up 43–0, Utah attempted an onside kick. After the play, a furious Glenn was caught giving the middle finger in the direction of the Utah sidelines on national television. The Mountain West Conference reprimanded Glenn, who would later apologize for the obscene gesture and regretted the \"guarantee.\"\nPersonal life.\nGlenn graduated from the University of South Dakota in 1971. While there, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in health, physical education, recreation and athletics. He played quarterback and wide receiver for the Coyotes, and was selected a team captain as a senior. During college, he completed Army ROTC and upon graduation was commissioned as a second lieutenant serving two-years of active duty as an MP at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1975, he received a master's degree in education from South Dakota. In 2006, Glenn was inducted into the university's Hall of Fame.\nGlenn and his wife, Michele, are both natives of Lincoln, Nebraska. They have two adult children: a daughter, Erin, and a son, Casey. Casey was an All-American offensive lineman at Carroll College in Helena, Montana, concluding his playing career in 2002 when Carroll won their first of five NAIA National Championships. After coaching at Idaho State, South Dakota and Oklahoma, he served as tight ends and fullbacks coach after serving as Director of Football Operations for Wyoming under his father."

        "title": "List of 2006 Winter Olympics medal winners",
        "text": "The 2006 Winter Olympics were held in Turin, Italy, from 10 February to 26 February 2006. Approximately 2,508 athletes from 80 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these Games. Overall, 84 events in 15 disciplines were contested; 45 events were opened to men, 37 to women and 2 were mixed pairs events. Two disciplines were open only to men: Nordic combined and ski jumping, while figure skating was the only one in which men and women competed together in teams. \nEight new events were introduced: snowboard cross, team pursuit (speed skating), team sprint (cross-country skiing), and the mass-start race (biathlon). The team sprint events replaced the classical men's 30 kilometers (km) and women's 15 km cross-country distances, held at the previous Winter Games in 2002. In total, there were six more events than in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States.\nA total of 451 individual athletes won medals. Germany won the highest number of gold medals (11) and led in overall medals (29) for the third consecutive Games. Athletes from 26 NOCs won at least one medal; of these, 18 won at least one gold medal. Latvia (Mārtiņš Rubenis – luge, men's singles) and Slovakia (Radoslav Židek – snowboarding, men's snowboard cross) won the first medals in their Winter Olympic history. Korean short-track speed skater Ahn Hyun-Soo was the most successful athlete, winning three gold medals and a bronze medal. His compatriot Jin Sun-Yu and Germany's Michael Greis also won three gold medals in short-track speed skating and biathlon respectively.\nCanadian speed skater Cindy Klassen won five medals (one gold, two silver, two bronze) and became the eighth Winter Olympian to win five medals at one edition of the Games. German Claudia Pechstein won two medals and became the fourth Winter Olympian to win at least one medal at five editions of the Games. Canadian Duff Gibson won a gold medal in the men's skeleton and, at age 39, became the oldest athlete to win a gold medal in an individual event at the Winter Olympics.\nSeveral records for career medals in a sport were tied or surpassed, including alpine skiing (Norwegian Kjetil André Aamodt won a gold medal to extend his career record to eight medals), biathlon (Germany's Uschi Disl won a bronze, further extending her lead in this sport with nine medals; Norwegian Ole Einar Bjørndalen's three medals raised his career medal tally to nine), freestyle skiing (Norwegian Kari Traa won a silver for a career total of three medals), Nordic combined (Austrian Felix Gottwald won three medals, and tied the record with a career total of six), short track speed skating (American Apolo Anton Ohno and Chinese athletes Yang Yang (A) and Li Jiajun have all won five medals in total), and speed skating (Claudia Pechstein won two medals to extend her career record to nine medals).\nMedal winner changes.\nA. Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva was the only 2006 Winter Olympics medalist to be stripped of their medal. She won a silver medal in the 15 km race, but tested positive for carphedon and was thus stripped of her medal. Germany's Martina Glagow was given the silver medal and fellow Russian Albina Akhatova won the bronze.\nStatistics.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes who won at least two gold medals or three total medals are listed below."

        "title": "Doping at the Olympic Games",
        "text": "Competitors at the Olympic Games have used banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs.\nHistory.\nThe use of performance-enhancing tactics or more formally known as PEDs, and more broadly, the use of any external device to nefariously influence the outcome of a sporting event has been a part of the Olympics since its inception in Ancient Greece. One speculation as to why men were required to compete naked was to prevent the use of extra accoutrements and to keep women from competing in events specifically designed for men. Athletes were also known to drink \"magic\" potions and eat exotic meats in the hopes of giving them an athletic edge on their competition. If they were caught cheating, their likenesses were often engraved into stone and placed in a pathway that led to the Olympic stadium. In the modern Olympic era, chemically enhancing one's performance has evolved into a sophisticated science, but in the early years of the Modern Olympic movement the use of performance-enhancing drugs was almost as crude as its ancient predecessors. For example, the winner of the marathon at the 1904 Games, Thomas Hicks, was given strychnine and brandy by his coach, even during the race.\nDuring the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes discovered ways to improve their athletic abilities by boosting testosterone. As their methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that the use of performance-enhancing drugs was not only a threat to the integrity of sport but could also have potentially fatal side effects on the athlete. The only Olympic death linked to athletic drug use occurred at the Rome Games of 1960. During the cycling road race, Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamine, which had caused him to lose consciousness during the race. Jensen's death exposed to the world how endemic drug use was among elite athletes. By the mid-1960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and the IOC followed suit in 1967.\nThe first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use, \"two beers\" to steady his nerves. Liljenwall was the only athlete to test positive for a banned substance at the 1968 Olympics, but as the technology and testing techniques improved, the number of athletes discovered to be chemically enhancing their performance increased as well. \nThe most systematic case of drug use for athletic achievement is that of the East German Olympic teams of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990, documents were discovered that showed many East German female athletes, especially swimmers, had been administered anabolic steroids and other drugs by their coaches and trainers. Girls as young as eleven were started on the drug regimen without consent from their parents. American female swimmers, including Shirley Babashoff, accused the East Germans of using performance-enhancing drugs as early as the 1976 Summer Games. Babashoff's comments were dismissed by the international and domestic media as sour grapes since Babashoff, a clear favorite to win multiple gold medals, won three silver medals – losing all three times to either of the two East Germans Kornelia Ender or Petra Thümer, and one gold medal in a relay. There was no suspicion of cheating on the part of the East German female swimmers even though their medal tally increased from four silvers and one bronze in 1972 to ten golds (out of a possible 12), six silvers, and one bronze in 1976. No clear evidence was discovered until after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the aforementioned documents proved that East Germany had embarked on a state-sponsored drug regimen to dramatically improve their competitiveness at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events. Many of the East German authorities responsible for this program have been subsequently tried and found guilty of various crimes in the German penal system.\nThe report, titled \"Doping in Germany from 1950 to today\", details how the West German government helped fund a wide-scale doping program. West Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades. Doping of West German athletes was prevalent at the Munich Games of 1972, and at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\". On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"\nDocuments obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nChina conducted a state sanctioned doping programme on athletes in the 1980s and 1990s. In a July 2012 interview published by the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" newspaper, Chen Zhangho, the lead doctor for the Chinese Olympic team at the Los Angeles, Seoul and Barcelona Olympics told of how he had tested hormones, blood doping and steroids on about fifty elite athletes. Chen also accused the United States, the Soviet Union and France of using performance-enhancing drugs at the same time as China.\nA very publicized steroid-related disqualification at an Olympic Games was the case of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who won the Men's 100 metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but tested positive for stanozolol. His gold medal was subsequently stripped and awarded to runner-up Carl Lewis, who had tested positive for stimulants at the U.S. Olympic Trials. The highest level of stimulant Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as a negative test. The acceptable level was later raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\" The IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC followed the correct procedures in dealing with positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration.\nResponse.\nIn the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, leading to the formation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 1999. The 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics have shown that the effort to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs from the Olympics is not over, as several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified due to failing a drug test. During the 2006 Winter Olympics, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the \"Olympic Standard\") has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate. During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood testing was used in a coordinated effort to detect banned substances and recent blood transfusions. While several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games, six athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing.\nSummer Olympic Games.\nWhat follows is a list of all the athletes that have tested positive for a banned substance either during or after an Olympic Games in which they competed. Any medals listed were revoked by the International Olympic Commission (IOC). In 1967 the IOC banned the use of performance-enhancing drugs, instituted a Medical Commission, and created a list of banned substances. Mandatory testing began at the following year's Games. In a few cases the IOC has reversed earlier rulings that stripped athletes of medals.\n1968 Mexico City.\nIn addition, the Bulgarian Greco-Roman wrestler Hristo Traykov was disqualified from his bout against Dave Hazewinkel for using concealed smelling salts during their bout.\n1972 Munich.\nAs a 16-year-old, Rick DeMont qualified to represent the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. He originally won the gold medal in the men's 400-meter freestyle, but following the race, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) disqualified DeMont after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax. The positive test following the 400-meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was barred from any other events at the Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder.\nBefore the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) had not cleared them with the IOC's medical committee. In 2001, his gold medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics was recognised by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). However, only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has, as of 2019, refused to do so.\n1976 Montreal.\nLeibel was disqualified from the race that took place on the day that he provided the positive sample but was allowed to continue in the event.\n1980 Moscow.\nThough no athletes were caught doping at the 1980 Summer Olympics, it has been revealed that athletes had begun using testosterone and other drugs for which tests had not been yet developed. According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\". A 1989 report by a committee of the Australian Senate claimed that \"there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner ... who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might well have been called the Chemists' Games\".\nA member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to epitestosterone in urine. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols. The first documented case of \"blood doping\" occurred at the 1980 Summer Olympics as a runner was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5000 m and 10,000 m.\n1984 Los Angeles.\nThe organizers of the Los Angeles games had refused to provide the IOC doping authorities with a safe prior to the start of the games. Due to a lack of security, medical records were subsequently stolen. A 1994 letter from IOC Medical Commission chair Alexandre de Mérode claimed that Tony Daly, a member of the Los Angeles organizing committee had destroyed the records. Dick Pound later wrote of his frustration that the organizing committee had removed evidence before it could be acted on by the IOC. Pound also claimed that IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Primo Nebiolo, President of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) had conspired to delay the announcement of positive tests so that the games could pass without controversy.\nThe American cyclist Pat McDonough later admitted to \"blood doping\" at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Following the games it was revealed that one-third of the U.S. cycling team had received blood transfusions before the games, where they won nine medals, their first medal success since the 1912 Summer Olympics. \"Blood doping\" was banned by the IOC in 1985 (at the time of the Olympics it was not banned), though no test existed for it at the time.\n1996 Atlanta.\nFive athletes tested positive for the stimulant bromantan and were disqualified by the IOC, but later reinstated after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport: swimmers Andrey Korneyev and Nina Zhivanevskaya, Greco-Roman wrestler Zafar Guliev and sprinter Marina Trandenkova, all from Russia, and the Lithuanian track cyclist Rita Razmaitė. Dr. Vitaly Slionssarenko, physician to the Lithuanian cycling team and team coach Boris Vasilyev were expelled from the games by the IOC for their role in the scandal. The athletes and officials were reprimanded.\nThe Irish long-distance runner Marie McMahon (Davenport) got a reprimand after testing positive for the stimulant phenylpropanolamine, and Cuban judoka Estella Rodriguez Villanueva got a reprimand after she tested positive for the diuretic furosemide.\n2008 Beijing.\n\"Zero Tolerance for Doping\" was adopted as an official slogan for the Beijing Olympic Games. A number of athletes were already eliminated by testing prior to coming to Beijing.\nOut of the 4,500 samples that were collected from participating athletes at the games, six athletes with positive specimens were ousted from the competition. Further positive tests were found in 2016, as samples had been sealed and stored for eight years. The quality of the original testing was questioned when the BBC reported that samples positive for EPO were labeled as negative by Chinese laboratories in July 2008. The initial rate of positive findings was lower than at Athens in 2004, but the prevalence of doping had not necessarily decreased; the technology for creating and concealing drugs had become more sophisticated, and a number of drugs could not be detected.\nIn August 2015, the Turkish Athletics Federation confirmed that an in-competition test of Elvan Abeylegesse at the 2007 IAAF World Championships\nin Athletics had been retested and found to be positive for a controlled substance, and that she had been temporarily suspended. On 29 March 2017, the IAAF confirmed the positive test, announced retroactive disqualifications and voided all of her results from 25 August 2007 until 25 August 2009, including the 2008 Summer Olympics. As a result, she was stripped of two silver medals she had won in the women's 5,000 and 10,000 meter races.\nIn May 2016, following the Russian doping scandal, the IOC announced that 32 targeted retests had come back positive for performance-enhancing drugs, of which Russian News Agency TASS announced that 14 were from Russian athletes, 11 of them track and field athletes, including 2012 Olympic champion high jumper Anna Chicherova. Authorities have sent the B-samples for confirmation testing. Those confirmed as having taken doping agents stand to lose records and medals from the 2008 games to 2016 under IOC and WADA rules.\nOn 18 June 2016, the IWF reported that as a consequence of the IOC's reanalyses of samples from the 2008 Olympic Games, the samples of the following seven weightlifters had returned positive results: Hripsime Khurshudyan (Armenia), Intigam Zairov (Azerbaijan), Alexandru Dudoglo (Moldova), gold medalist Ilya Ilyin (Kazakhstan), bronze medalist Nadezda Evstyukhina and silver medalist Marina Shainova (both from Russia), and Nurcan Taylan (Turkey). In line with the relevant rules and regulations, the IWF imposed mandatory provisional suspensions upon the athletes. Zairov and Ilyin had been serving previous suspensions. In November 2016, Ilyin was stripped of the gold medal.\nOn 22 July 2016, Sibel Özkan (TUR) was disqualified due to an anti-doping rule violation and stripped of her silver medal. Medals have not been reallocated as yet.\nOn 28 July 2016, it was announced that retests of samples from the 2008 Summer Olympics detected a positive sample for performance-enhancing drugs from Aksana Miankova of Belarus, who won a gold medal in the women's hammer throw. There have been no decisions about stripping and reallocation of medals as yet.\nOn 16 August 2016, the Russian women's 4 × 100 metres relay team was disqualified for doping. Russian teammates were stripped of their gold Olympic medals, as Yuliya Chermoshanskaya had her samples reanalyzed and tested positive for two prohibited substances. The IAAF was requested to modify the results accordingly and to consider any further action within its own competence.\nOn 19 August 2016, the Russian women's 4 × 400 metres relay team was disqualified for doping. Russian teammates were stripped of their silver Olympic medals, as Anastasiya Kapachinskaya had her samples reanalyzed and tested positive for the same two prohibited substances as Chermoshanskaya.\nOn 24 August 2016, the IWF reported that as a consequence of the IOC's reanalyses of samples from the 2008 Olympic Games, the samples of the following athletes had returned positive results: Nizami Pashayev (Azerbaijan), Iryna Kulesha, Nastassia Novikava, Andrei Rybakou (all from Belarus), Cao Lei, Chen Xiexia, Liu Chunhong (all from China), Mariya Grabovetskaya, Maya Maneza, Irina Nekrassova, Vladimir Sedov (all from Kazakhstan), Khadzhimurat Akkaev, Dmitry Lapikov (both from Russia), and Natalya Davydova and Olha Korobka (both from Ukraine). In line with the relevant rules and regulations, the IWF imposed mandatory provisional suspensions upon the athletes, who remain provisionally suspended in view of potential anti-doping rule violations until their cases are closed.\nOn 29 August 2016, some non-official reports indicated that Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan had been stripped of the 2008 Olympic gold medal in the freestyle wrestling 120 kg event due to a positive test for doping.\nOn 31 August 2016, the IOC disqualified six sportspeople for failing doping tests at the 2008 Games. They included three Russian medalists: weightlifters Nadezhda Evstyukhina (bronze medal in the women's 75 kg event), Marina Shainova (silver medal in the women's 58 kg event), and Tatyana Firova, who finished second with teammates in the 4 × 400 m relay. Bronze medal weightlifter Tigran Martirosyan of Armenia (men's 69 kg event) and fellow weightlifters Alexandru Dudoglo (9th place) of Moldova and Intigam Zairov (9th place) of Azerbaijan were also disqualified.\nOn 1 September 2016, the IOC disqualified a further two athletes. Cuban discus thrower Yarelys Barrios, who won a silver medal in the women's discus, was disqualified after testing positive for Acetazolamide and ordered to return her medal. Qatari sprinter Samuel Francis, who finished 16th in the 100 meters, was also disqualified after testing positive for Stanozolol.\nOn 13 September 2016, four more Russian athletes were disqualified for doping offenses. Two of those were medalists from the 2008 Summer Olympics: silver medalist Mariya Abakumova in the women's javelin throw and Denis Alekseyev, who was part of the bronze medal team in the men's 4 × 400 m relay. Inga Abitova, who finished 6th in the 10,000 meters, and cyclist Ekaterina Gnidenko also tested positive for a banned substance and were disqualified.\nOn 23 September 2016, some non-official reports indicate wrestler Vasyl Fedoryshyn of Ukraine has been stripped of the 2008 Olympic silver medal in the freestyle 60 kg event due to a positive test for doping.\nOn 6 October 2016, the IOC disqualified Anna Chicherova of the Russian Federation for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. She won a bronze medal in the women's high jump. Russia would likely keep the bronze medal, as the fourth-place athlete in the competition was also from Russia. Through 6 October 2016, the IOC has reported Adverse Analytical Findings for 25 weightlifters from its 2016 retests of samples from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, all but three of whom tested positive for anabolic agents (three Chinese weightlifters were positive for growth hormones).\nOn 26 October 2016, the IOC disqualified nine more athletes for failing drugs tests at the 2008 Games. Among them were six medal winners: weightlifters Andrei Rybakou and Nastassia Novikava, both from Belarus, and Olha Korobka of Ukraine; women's steeplechase bronze medalist Ekaterina Volkova of Russia; and freestyle wrestlers Soslan Tigiev of Uzbekistan and Taimuraz Tigiyev of Kazakhstan. The others were men's 62 kg weightlifter Sardar Hasanov of Azerbaijan, long jumper Wilfredo Martinez of Cuba, and 100m-hurdler Josephine Nnkiruka Onyia of Spain.\nOn 17 November 2016, the IOC disqualified 16 more athletes for failing drugs tests at the 2008 games. Among them were 10 medal winners: weightlifters Khadzhimurat Akkaev and Dmitry Lapikov and wrestler Khasan Baroev from the Russian Federation, weightlifters Mariya Grabovetskaya, Irina Nekrassova and wrestler Asset Mambetov from Kazakhstan, weightlifter Nataliya Davydova and pole vaulter Denys Yurchenko from Ukraine, long/triple jumper Hrysopiyí Devetzí of Greece and wrestler Vitaliy Rahimov of Azerbaijan. The others were women's 75 kg weightlifter Iryna Kulesha of Belarus, women's +63 kg weightlifter Maya Maneza of Kazakhstan, women's high jumper Vita Palamar of Ukraine, men's 94 kg weightlifter Nizami Pashayev of Azerbaijan, men's 85 kg weightlifter Vladimir Sedov of Kazakhstan, and women's high jumper Elena Slesarenko of the Russian Federation.\nOn 25 November 2016, the IOC disqualified 5 more athletes for failing drugs tests at the 2008 games. Among them were 3 medal winners: gold-medalists 94 kg weightlifter Ilya Ilin of Kazakhstan and hammer thrower Aksana Miankova of Belarus and silver-medalist shot putter Natallia Mikhnevich of Belarus. The others were shot putter Pavel Lyzhyn and 800m runner Sviatlana Usovich, both of Belarus.\nOn 12 January 2017, the IOC disqualified five more athletes for failing drug tests at the 2008 Games. These included three Chinese women's weightlifting gold medalists: Lei Cao (75 kg), Xiexia Chen (48 kg) and Chunhong Liu (69 kg). Two women athletes from Belarus were disqualified: bronze medalist shot putter Nadzeya Ostapchuk and hammer thrower Darya Pchelnik, who did not medal.\nOn 25 January 2017, the IOC stripped Jamaica of the athletics gold medal in the men's 4 × 100 m relay due to Nesta Carter testing positive for the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine. The IOC also stripped Russian jumper Tatyana Lebedeva of two silver medals in women's triple jump and long jump due to use of turinabol.\nOn 1 March 2017, the IOC disqualified Victoria Tereshchuk of Ukraine due to use of turinabol and stripped her of the bronze medal in modern pentathlon.\nBy April 2017, the 2008 Summer Olympics has had the most (50) Olympic medals stripped for doping violations. Russia is the leading country with 14 medals stripped.\nDid not start.\nAthletes who were selected for the Games, but provisionally suspended before competing.\n2012 London.\nIt was announced prior to the Summer games that half of all competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the games and the end of the Paralympic games at GlaxoSmithKline's New Frontiers Science Park site in Harlow, Essex. All medalists would also be tested. The Olympic anti-doping laboratory would test up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.\nThe head of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), John Fahey, announced on 24 July that 107 athletes had been sanctioned for doping offences in the six months to 19 June. The \"In-competition\" period began on 16 July. During the \"In-competition\" period Olympic competitors can be tested at any time without notice or in advance.\nBritish sprinter Dwain Chambers, cyclist David Millar and shot putter Carl Myerscough competed in London after the British Olympic Association's policy of punishing drug cheats with lifetime bans was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nRussian Darya Pishchalnikova participated in the 2012 Olympics and was awarded a silver medal. However, she tested positive for the anabolic steroid oxandrolone in the samples taken in May 2012. In December 2012, she sent an email to WADA containing details on an alleged state-run doping program in Russia. According to \"The New York Times\", the email reached three top WADA officials but the agency decided not to open an inquiry and instead sent her email to Russian sports officials. In April 2013 Pishchalnikova was banned by the Russian Athletics Federation for ten years, and her results from May 2012 were annulled, meaning she was set on track to lose her Olympic medal. Her ban by the Russian Athletics Federation was likely in retaliation.\nGold medalists at the games who had been involved in previous doping offences included Alexander Vinokourov, the winner of the men's road race, Tatyana Lysenko, the winner of the women's hammer throw, Aslı Çakır Alptekin winner of the women's 1500 meters and Sandra Perković, winner of the women's discus throw. Other competitors at the Summer games involved in previous doping cases included American athletes Justin Gatlin and LaShawn Merritt, and Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake.\nSpanish athlete Ángel Mullera was first selected for the 3000 m steeplechase and later removed when emails were published in which he discussed EPO use with a trainer. Mullera appealed to CAS which ordered the Spanish Olympic Committee to allow him to participate.\nPrior to the Olympic competition, several prominent track and field athletes were ruled out of the competition due to failed tests. World indoor medallists Dimitrios Chondrokoukis, Debbie Dunn, and Mariem Alaoui Selsouli were withdrawn from their Olympic teams in July for doping, as was 2004 Olympic medallist Zoltán Kővágó. At the Olympic competition, Tameka Williams admitted to taking a banned stimulant and was removed from the games. Ivan Tsikhan did not compete in the hammer throw as a retest of his sample from the 2004 Athens Olympics, where he won silver, was positive. Amine Laâlou, Marina Marghieva, Diego Palomeque, and defending 50 km walk champion Alex Schwazer were also suspended before taking part in their events.\nSyrian hurdler Ghfran Almouhamad became the first track-and-field athlete to be suspended following a positive in-competition doping sample. Nadzeya Astapchuk was stripped of the women's shot put title after her sample came back positive for the banned anabolic agent metenolone. Karin Melis Mey was withdrawn before the long jump final when an earlier failed doping test was confirmed.\nA WADA report released in 2015 detailed an extensive Russian state-sponsored doping program implicating athletes, coaches, various Russian institutions, doctors and labs. The report stated that the London Olympic Games \"were, in a sense, sabotaged by the admission of athletes who should have not been competing\" and detailed incidents of bribery and bogus urine samples. The report recommended that Russia be barred from track and field events for the 2016 Olympics. It also recommended lifetime bans for five coaches and five athletes from the country, including runners Mariya Savinova, Ekaterina Poistogova, Anastasiya Bazdyreva, Kristina Ugarova, and Tatjana Myazina.\nOn 15 June 2016, it was announced that four London 2012 Olympic weightlifting champions had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. They include Kazakhstan's Ilya Ilyin (94 kg), Zulfiya Chinshanlo (53 kg), Maiya Maneza (63 kg) and Svetlana Podobedova (75 kg). If confirmed, Kazakhstan would drop from 12th to 23rd in the 2012 medal standings. Six other lifters who competed at the 2012 Games also tested positive after hundreds of samples were reanalysed. Among them are Russia's Apti Aukhadov (silver at 85 kg), Ukraine's Yuliya Kalina (bronze at 58 kg), Belarusian Maryna Shkermankova (bronze at 69 kg), Azerbaijan's Boyanka Kostova and Belarus duo Dzina Sazanavets and Yauheni Zharnasek. On 27 July 2016, IWF has reported in the second wave of re-sampling that three silver medalists from Russia, namely Natalya Zabolotnaya (at 75 kg), Aleksandr Ivanov (at 94 kg) and Svetlana Tsarukaeva (at 63 kg), together with bronze medalists Armenian Hripsime Khurshudyan (at 75+ kg), Belarusian Iryna Kulesha (at 75 kg) and Moldovan Cristina Iovu (at 53 kg) have tested positive for steroid dehydrochlormethyltestosterone. Aukhadov was stripped of his silver medal by the IOC on 18 October 2016. On 27 October 2016 Maiya Maneza was stripped of her gold medal. In November 2016, Ilyin was stripped of the London gold medal.\nOn 13 July 2016, the IOC announced that Yuliya Kalina of Ukraine had been disqualified from the 2012 Summer Olympics and ordered to return the bronze medal from the 58 kg weightlifting event. Reanalysis of Kalina's samples from London 2012 resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol). The positions were adjusted accordingly.\nOn 9 August 2016, the IOC announced that Oleksandr Pyatnytsya of Ukraine would be stripped of his silver medal in the javelin throw after he tested positive for the prohibited substance dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol). Redistribution of medals has not yet been announced, but the likely case is the silver and bronze medals will be given to Finland and Czech Republic instead.\nOn 20 August 2016, the IOC announced that Yevgeniya Kolodko of Russia would be stripped of her silver medal in shot put after she tested positive of dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol) and ipamorelin. Medals are not reallocated yet.\nOn 29 August 2016, a report indicated that a retested sample for Besik Kudukhov of Russia, the silver medalist in the men's 60 kg freestyle wrestling event, had returned a positive result (later disclosed as dehydrochlormethyltestosterone). Kudakhov died in a car crash in December 2013. On 27 October 2016, the IOC dropped all disciplinary proceedings against Kudukhov, stating that such proceedings cannot be conducted against a deceased person. As a result, it said, Olympic results that would have been reviewed will remain uncorrected, which is the unavoidable consequence of the fact that the proceedings cannot move forward.\nOn 13 September 2016, the IWF reported that the men's 94 kg weightlifting bronze medalist, Moldova's Anatolie Cîrîcu, had tested positive for the dehydrochlormethyltestosterone.\nOn 6 October 2016, the IWF reported that as a consequence of the IOC's reanalyses of samples from the 2012 Olympic Games, a sample of Norayr Vardanyan, who represented Armenia, had returned a positive result. In line with the relevant rules and regulations, the IWF imposed mandatory provisional suspensions upon Vardanyan, who remains provisionally suspended until his case is closed. On 12 January 2017, the IOC disqualified Vardanyan. Through 6 October 2016, the IOC had reported Adverse Analytical Findings for 23 weightlifters from its 2016 retests of samples from the 2012 London Olympic Games, all of whom tested positive for anabolic agents.\nOn 11 October 2016, Tatyana Lysenko of the Russian Federation was disqualified from the women's hammer throw, in which she won the gold medal. She had tested positive for a banned substance. The IOC requested the IAAF to modify the results of this event accordingly. The silver medalist Anita Włodarczyk of Poland would likely take the gold medal in her place.\nOn 18 October 2016, the IOC disqualified Apti Aukhadov of the Russian Federation for doping and stripped him of the silver medal. The IOC requested the IWF to modify the results of this event accordingly; it has not yet published modified results.\nOn 18 October 2016, the IOC reported that Maksym Mazuryk of Ukraine, who competed in the Men's Pole Vault event, was disqualified from the 2012 London Games, in which he ranked 18th. Re-analysis of Mazuryk's samples resulted in a positive test for dehydrochlormethyltestosterone.\nOn 27 October 2016 the IOC disqualified a further eight athletes for failing doping tests at the games. This included four medal winners in weightlifting: Zulfiya Chinshanlo, Maiya Maneza and Svetlana Podobedova, all from Kazakhstan, and Maryna Shkermankova of Belarus. The others were hammer thrower Kirill Ikonnikov of Russia, women's 69 kg weightlifter Dzina Sazanavets of Belarus, pole vaulter Dmitry Starodubtsev of Russia, and men's +105 kg weightlifter Yauheni Zharnasek of Belarus.\nOn 21 November 2016 the IOC disqualified a further 12 athletes for failing doping tests at the games. This included 6 medal winners in weightlifting, including Alexandr Ivanov (Russia), Anatoli Ciricu (Moldova), Cristina Iovu (Moldova), Natalya Zabolotnaya (Russia), Iryna Kulesha (Belarus), and Hripsime Khurshudyan (Armenia). Moldova has lost all its 2012 London medals. The others were hammer thrower Oleksandr Drygol and long jumper Margaryta Tverdokhlib, both of Ukraine, 85 kg weightlifter Rauli Tsirekidze of Georgia, 94 kg weightlifter Almas Uteshov of Kazakhstan, 94 kg weightlifter Andrey Demanov of Russia and 3000m steeplechaser Yuliya Zaripova of Russia, who had previously been sanctioned in March 2016 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nOn 25 November 2016, the IOC disqualified 4 more athletes for failing drug tests at the 2012 games. They were gold medalist 94 kg weightlifter Ilya Ilin of Kazakhstan, hammer thrower Aksana Miankova and long jumper Nastassia Mironchyk-Ivanova, both of Belarus, and 58 kg weightlifter Boyanka Kostova of Azerbaijan.\nOn 29 November 2016 the Court of Arbitration for Sport issued a decision that all results achieved by 2012 Olympic heptathlon bronze medalist Tatyana Chernova of Russia between 15 August 2011 and 22 July 2013 are annulled. It also annulled all of Yekaterina Sharmina's results between 17 June 2011 and 5 August 2015, including her 33rd-place finish in the 2012 women's 1500m. CAS ruled that they \"have been found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation ... of the International Athletic Association Federation (IAAF) Competition Rules after analysis of their Athlete Biological Passports (ABP) showed evidence of blood doping.\"\nOn 12 January 2017, the IOC disqualified three weightlifters for failing drug tests at the 2012 games. Two competed in men's 94 kg weightlifting: Intigam Zairov of Azerbaijan and Norayr Vardanyan of Armenia. Women's 63 kg weightlifter Sibel Simsek of Turkey was disqualified. None was a medalist at these games.\nOn 1 February 2017, the IOC disqualified three athletes due to failed doping tests, all of whom tested positive for turinabol. Russian women's discus thrower Vera Ganeeva, who finished 23rd, Turkish boxer Adem Kilicci, who ranked 5th in men's 69–75 kg boxing, and Russian 400m runner Antonina Krivoshapka, who finished 6th, were disqualified. Krivoshapka also was part of the Russian silver medal-winning women's 4 × 400 m relay team, which was stripped of the silver medals.\nIn December 2014, a documentary aired on German TV in which 800m gold medalist Mariya Savinova allegedly admitted to using banned substances on camera. In November 2015, Savinova was one of five Russian runners the World Anti-Doping Agency recommended to receive a lifetime ban for doping during the London Olympics, along with 800m bronze medalist Ekaterina Poistogova. On 10 February 2017, the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a four-year ban that effectively stripped Savinova of her Olympic gold and other medals. On 7 April 2017, CAS refused to decide on disqualification from 2012, and disqualify Ekaterina Poistogova from 2015. Thus, Ekaterina Poistogova retained her Olympic 2012 medal at women's 800 metres athletic event. In 2024, the Russian Athleteics Federation cancelled Poistogova's results from July 2012 to October 2014 after analysing old samples. Poistogova stands to lose the Olympic 800m silver medal.\nAs of December 2022, the 2012 Summer Olympics has seen a record 40 Olympic medals stripped for doping violations. Russia is the leading country with 17 medals stripped.\nOn 21 March 2022, the Athletics Integrity Unit of World Athletics issued a two-year ban for Russian racewalker Elena Lashmanova, starting from 9 March 2021, and also disqualified her results from 18 February 2012, to 3 January 2014, thus stripping her gold medal.\nDid not start.\nAthletes who were selected for the Games, but provisionally suspended before competing.\n2016 Rio de Janeiro.\nOriginally, Russia submitted a list of 389 athletes for competition. On 7 August 2016, the IOC cleared 278 athletes, and 111 were removed because of the state-sponsored doping scandal.\nThe Taiwanese weightlifter Lin Tzu-chi was withdrawn from the games hours before her event by her team's delegation for an abnormal drugs test.\nKenyan athletics coach, John Anzrah who travelled to Rio independently of his country's delegation, was sent home after being caught posing as an athlete during a doping test, and was followed by Kenya's track and field manager, Michael Rotich, who was filmed by a newspaper offering to give athletes advanced notice of any pending drugs test in return for a one-off payment.\nOn 13 October 2016, the IWF reported that weightlifter Gabriel Sincraian of Romania, who won bronze in the men's 85-kg event, tested positive for excess testosterone in a test connected to the Rio Olympics. On 8 December 2016, the CAS affirmed the disqualification of Sincraian and stripped him of the bronze medal. The CAS also disqualified silver medalist 52 kg boxer Misha Aloian of Russia after he tested positive for tuaminoheptane.\nDid not start.\nAthletes who were selected for the Games, but provisionally suspended before competing.\n2020 Tokyo.\nDid not start.\nAthletes who were selected for the Games, but provisionally suspended before competing.\nWinter Olympic Games.\n1968 Grenoble.\nNo athletes were caught doping at these Games.\n1980 Lake Placid.\nNo athletes tested positive at these Games.\n1984 Sarajevo.\nThe Finnish cross-country skier Aki Karvonen admitted in 1994 that he'd had blood transfusions for the Sarajevo Games. Blood transfusions weren't formally banned by IOC until 1986. Karvonen won a silver and two bronze at the games.\n1992 Albertville.\nNo athletes were caught using performance-enhancing drugs at these Games. The Russian biathlete Sergei Tarasov admitted in 2015 that the Russian biathlon team had carried out illegal blood transfusions at the Games. Something went very wrong with his transfusion, and he was rushed to the hospital where they saved his life.\n1994 Lillehammer.\nNo athletes were caught using performance-enhancing drugs at these Games.\n1998 Nagano.\nNo athletes were caught using performance-enhancing drugs at these Games. The Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, winner of the men's giant slalom, was initially disqualified and stripped of his gold medal by the International Olympic Committee's executive board after testing positive for marijuana. Marijuana was not then on the list of prohibited substances by the IOC, and their decision was reversed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Rebagliati's medal reinstated.\n2006 Turin.\nOn 25 April 2007, six Austrian athletes were banned for life from the Olympics for their involvement in a doping scandal at the 2006 Turin Olympics, the first time the IOC punished athletes without a positive or missed doping test. The Austrians were found guilty of possessing doping substances and taking part in a conspiracy, based on materials seized by Italian police during a raid on the athletes' living quarters. The Austrians also had their competition results from Turin annulled. A seventh athlete, cross-country skier Christian Hoffmann, had his case referred to the International Ski Federation for further investigation, but IOC charges were dismissed.\nThe IOC has retested nearly 500 doping samples that were collected at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier Kristina Šmigun had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, faces a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing before the end of October. If Šmigun were to be stripped of her gold medals, Kateřina Neumannová of Czech Republic could be elevated to gold in the 7.5 + 7.5 km double pursuit event. Marit Bjørgen of Norway could acquire a seventh gold medal in the 10 km classical event.\nThe case against Šmigun was dropped on 13 December 2017 without any charges being raised.\nDid not start.\nOn 13 February 2006, the Brazilian Olympic Committee announced that Armando dos Santos' preventive antidoping test, which had been done in Brazil on 4 January 2006, was positive for the forbidden substance nandrolone. Santos was ejected from the team, being replaced by former sprinter Claudinei Quirino, the team's substitute athlete.\n2010 Vancouver.\nOn 23 December 2016, the IOC stated that it will re-analyse all samples from Russian athletes at the Olympic Winter Games of Vancouver 2010. In October 2017, the IOC stated that one sole athlete was caught from retests of doping samples from the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Biathlete Teja Gregorin was confirmed as this athlete by the International Biathlon Union. A total of 1195 samples from Vancouver 2010 (70% of the 1700 available) were reanalyzed. This included all medalists and all of the 170 Russian athletes. The IOC requested all Russian samples from the 2010 Games be retested after the publication of the McLaren Report. Russia's disappointing performance at Vancouver (11th in gold medal table with a total of 3 golds) is cited as the reason behind the implementation of a doping scheme alleged to have been in operation at major events such as the 2014 Games at Sochi.\n2014 Sochi.\nAccording to the director of the country's antidoping laboratory at the time, Grigory Rodchenkov, dozens of Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, including at least 15 medal winners, were part of a state-run doping program, meticulously planned for years to ensure dominance at the Games.\nIn December 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes (the number later rose to 46) at the Sochi Olympic Games. \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation.\nThree female figure skaters were named as being under investigation. They are Adelina Sotnikova, the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds. In November 2017 the proceeding against Sotnikova was dropped.\nSix cross-country skiers were suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren Report: Evgeniy Belov, Alexander Legkov, Alexey Petukhov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yulia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova. Legkov won a gold and silver medals, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals. The IOC disqualified all six from Sochi, imposed lifetime bans and, in the process, stripped Legkov and Vylegzhanin of the medals they had won in four events (three individual medals and one team medal). Nikita Kryukov, Alexander Bessmertnykh and Natalya Matveyeva were also disqualified on 22 December 2017.\nThe International Biathlon Union suspended two Russian biathletes who were in the Sochi games: Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova. Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal. They were disqualified and stripped of their medals on 27 November 2017.\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation suspended four Russian skeleton sliders. They were Alexander Tretyakov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a bronze. On 22 November 2017, the IOC stripped these medals and imposed lifetime Olympic bans on all four. Skeleton racer Sergei Chudinov was sanctioned on 28 November 2017.\nSeven Russian female ice hockey players were to have hearings before the Oswald Commission on 22 November 2017. Two of the seven were accused of submitting samples showing readings that were physically impossible to be held by a woman. The Russian women's ice hockey team finished sixth at Sochi 2014. On 12 December 2017, six of them were disqualified. Tatiana Burina and Anna Shukina were also disqualified ten days later.\nOn 24 November 2017, the IOC imposed life bans on bobsledder Alexandr Zubkov and speed skater Olga Fatkulina who won a combined 3 medals (2 gold, 1 silver). All their results were disqualified, meaning that Russia lost its first place in the medal standings. Bobsledders Aleksei Negodaylo and Dmitry Trunenkov were disqualified 3 days later. 3 other Russian athletes who didn't win medals were banned on 29 November 2017. Biathlete Olga Zaitseva and 2 other Russian athletes were banned on 1 December 2017. Bobsledder Alexey Voyevoda who had been already stripped of his gold medals due to the anti-doping violations committed by his teammates was sanctioned on 18 December 2017. Speed skaters Ivan Skobrev and Artyom Kuznetsov, lugers Albert Demchenko and Tatiana Ivanova, and bobsledders Liudmila Udobkina and Maxim Belugin were disqualified on 22 December 2017, bringing the total to 43. Demchenko and Ivanova were also stripped of their silver medals.\n2018 Pyeongchang.\nAfter the Russian Olympic Committee was barred from competing at the 2018 Winter Olympics, Russian athletes deemed to be clean were allowed to compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia.\n2022 Beijing.\nBy the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total of five athletes were reported for doping violations: Spanish figure skater Laura Barquero, Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, Iranian alpine skier Hossein Saveh Shemshaki, and two Ukrainians cross-country skier Valentyna Kaminska and bobsledder Lidiia Hunko.\nControversy surrounding the ROC.\nThe medal ceremony for the team event in figure skating, where the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won gold, originally scheduled for 8 February, was delayed over what International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required \"legal consultation\" with the International Skating Union. Several media outlets reported on 9 February that the issue was over a positive test for trimetazidine by the ROC's Kamila Valieva, which was officially confirmed on 11 February. Valieva's sample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December, but the sample was not analyzed at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) laboratory where it was sent for testing until 8 February, one day after the team event concluded.\nValieva was assessed a provisional suspension after her positive result, but upon appeal, she was cleared by RUSADA's independent Disciplinary Anti-Doping Committee (DAC) on 9 February, just a day after receiving the provisional suspension. Following formal appeals lodged by the IOC, the International Skating Union (ISU), and WADA to review RUSADA DAC's decision, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) heard the case on 13 February, and removal of her provisional suspension was upheld on 14 February, ahead of her scheduled appearance in the women's singles event beginning 15 February. Due to Valieva being a minor at the time, as well as being classified as a \"protected person\" under WADA guidelines, RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12 February that they would broaden the scope of their respective investigations to include members of her entourage (e.g. coaches, team doctors, etc.).\nOn 14 February, the CAS declined to reinstate Valieva's provisional suspension issued the previous Monday and ruled that she would be allowed provisionally to compete in the women's singles event. The CAS decided that preventing her from competing \"would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances\", while noting that any medals won by Valieva at the Beijing Olympics would be withheld pending the results of the continuing investigation into her doping violation. The temporary provisional decision from the court was made on three grounds: 1/ Due to her age, she is a \"Protected Person\" as per WADA Code, subject to different rules than adult athletes; 2/ Athlete \"did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing\"; 3/ \"There were serious issues of untimely notification of the results, ... which impinged upon the Athlete’s ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit\". The IOC announced that the team event medal ceremony, as well as the women's singles flower ceremony and medal ceremony if Valieva were to medal, would not take place until the investigation is over, and there is a concrete decision whether to strip Valieva and the ROC of their medals. To allow for the possibility that Valieva's results may be disqualified, the IOC asked the ISU to expand the qualifying field for the women's singles free skating by one to 25.\nOn 29 January 2024, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled in Valieva's doping case involving the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA). The International Skating Union (ISU) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) imposed a four year ban on Valieva backdated to 25 December 2021, and disqualified her of all competitive results from that date, including the first place finishes at the 2022 European Figure Skating Championships and the 2022 Olympic team event.\nDid not start.\nAthletes who were selected for the Games, but provisionally suspended before competing."

At the Division I Championship, the winner of each group was promoted to the following year's IIHF World Championship, while the loser of each group was relegated to the Division II. Beginning in 2012, the last place team from each group in the world championship is relegated to Division I A, to be replaced by first and second place in Division I A. Sixth place in I A is relegated (now) to group I B, replaced by its winner, while sixth in I B is relegated to Division II.\nThe Division I World Championship was formed in 2001 from Pool B and the top four Pool C teams. Beginning in 2012 the two groups became tiered rather than parallel. Group A teams were the nations who either were relegated from the World Championship, or placed 2nd and 3rd in their 2011 groups. Group B was formed from the 4th and 5th placed teams, as well as the teams promoted from Division II.

        "title": "Beta (climbing)",
        "text": "Beta is a climbing term that designates information about how to ascend a climbing route. Traditionally sourced in climbing guidebooks, online databases and apps now provide detailed climbing beta. The term is attributed to Texan climber Jack Mileski.\nWhen a climber completes a route on their first attempt and without falling, it is called an onsight if they had no beta, or a flash if they had beta (a completion after several failed attempts is called a redpoint). New grade milestones in the on-sighting and flashing of routes are actively followed in the climbing media. The discovery of \"new beta\" has led to the re-grading of notable and historic climbing routes.\nDescription.\nThe complexity of \"beta\" can range from a small hint about a difficult section (i.e. referred to as \"some\" beta), to a step-by-step instruction of the entire climb (i.e. referred to as \"the\" beta). Sometimes there is more than one way to climb a route and thus more than one beta; climbers can follow different route beta depending on their body shape (e.g. whether they have a long or short reach), and/or their preferred style and technique (e.g. may not have the power to overcome a roof, and thus take a different route). Multiple route options–and thus betas–are particularly common on long multi-pitch climbing and big wall climbing routes, for example on the famous Yosemite route \"Freerider\" and its optional \"Huber boulder problem\". \nIn rock climbing, beta can include background information about a route's grade of difficulty (e.g. what drove the grade), detailed aspects about the crux (e.g. \"you need to use your left hand, not your right\"), the climbing style needed (e.g. long reaches or tiny crimps), the best way to protect the route (e.g. \"insert a number 4 SCLD before attempting the crack\"), and specific information about hand or foot holds. For mountaineering and alpine climbing, beta may include information about the approach (e.g. crossing bergschrunds), the ability to find the correct route (e.g \"avoid the crack system on the left\"), the feasibility of exiting the route before completing it (e.g. key abseils to set up), and the situation regarding rock-fall and avalanche dangers.\nSometimes climbers display beta on a graphical \"beta-map\" (a more detailed move-by-move instruction guide than the route topo). Advanced climbers on very difficult routes try to connect the beta of their route to their muscle memory, so they don't have to think about the next move. \nCompetition climbers are given a fixed time to inspect the route as a group before the competition, but once the climbing begins, they must remain in the isolation zone away from the climbing wall, to prevent them learning more beta from watching fellow competitors attempting the route. During a time-limited pre-competition inspection, climbers try to work out the beta starting from the top of the route and working down, to avoid losing time.\nDerived terms.\nThe derived term spraying beta designates when a third party begins to impart unwanted beta without being asked for it (which can ruin an onsight attempt). The term breaking beta designates when a climber is able to bypass or skip a whole sequence of moves (e.g. using a dyno).\nAccess.\nThe official climbing guidebooks were the first systematic forms of beta. The beta in these physical climbing guidebooks was limited to the basic details of the climbing route (e.g. length, grade, direction/topo etc.) so as to manage the size of the guidebook and avoid giving so much information that would spoil an onsight attempt. With the development of the internet, a significant quantity of more detailed beta began to accumulate (e.g. complete YouTube videos on how to climb a specific route). Both established climbing guidebook publishers (e.g. 'RockFax' in Europe), and the new dedicated online climbing databases (e.g. Mountain Project and 'theCrag.com') began to aggregate this detailed beta in online databases and apps, alongside the traditional guidebook-type information. Open-source beta databases such as 'OpenBeta' also aggregate user-generated climbing beta.\nOrigin.\nThe original use of the term \"beta\" in climbing is generally attributed to the late Texan climber Jack Mileski, who climbed predominantly in the Shawangunks during the early 1980s. \"Beta\" is short for Betamax, an early videotape format since largely replaced by the VHS format. Reputedly, Mileski would record climbers ascending routes on Betamax tape and then share these tapes with other climbers, resulting in the term becoming synonymous with getting information on how to climb a route.\nOnsights and flashes.\nWhen climbers are attempting a graded climbing route for their very first time, a distinction is made on whether they complete the route on their very first attempt without falling. This distinction is further split depending on whether they had prior beta about the route. Where they had no beta, their ascent is called an onsight, and where they had prior beta, it is called a flash. \nThe climbing media records new grade milestones of onsights and flashes of major sport climbing routes. In 2023, the highest milestone in flashing a route was by Czech climber Adam Ondra who in 2018, became the first-ever climber in history to flash a graded sport climbing route, \"Super Crackinette\". In 2023, the highest milestone for on-sighting a route was set by German climber Alex Megos who in 2013, became the first-ever climber in history to onsight a graded sport climbing route, \"Estado Critico\". In 2023, Slovenian climber Janja Garnbret remains the only female climber to flash (\"La Fabelita\" in 2015) and onsight (\"Fish eye\" in 2021) an graded sport climbing route.\nEffect on re-grading.\nWhen a climber has made the first ascent (or first free ascent) of a climbing route, they will assign a technical grade to the route to reflect the difficulties encountered. This grade will be a function of the particular beta that the climber used to make their first ascent. As subsequent climbers repeat the new route, they may discover \"new beta\" that makes the route easier and thus lowers its grade. Notable examples include the 2021 downgrading of \"Bibiliographie\" from –the world's highest grade at the time–to after a slightly easier sequence of moves was worked out for the crux. New beta can also emerge from new climbing techniques; examples being the introduction of knee pads that enabled knee bar rests, and use of more advanced use heel hooks. In 2002, the famous bouldering route \"Dreamtime\" was downgraded from being the world's first-ever graded boulder to being grade , with the discovery of new beta that used heel hooks to make the route slightly easier, thus reducing the grade.\nNotable beta.\nCertain famous climbs have beta around very specific necessary sequences of movements or actions that have in themselves become notable:"

        "text": "Steve Walsh (born 28 March 1972) is a retired professional rugby union referee from New Zealand. He officiated at international level from 1998 to 2014, and at three Rugby World Cups, including refereeing the semi-final between South Africa and Argentina in 2007. Walsh became the most experienced Super Rugby referee in 2014, passing Jonathan Kaplan's record before retiring from the game in 2015.\nEarly life.\nSteve Reid Walsh was born in Cambridge, New Zealand and attended Glenfield College and the Kristin School in Auckland. He played junior provincial representative rugby until a spinal injury and subsequent medical check ended his playing career at the age of 13. Scans revealed just two-and-a-half vertebrae in his neck, a birth defect which meant his neck was unstable and ruled him out of playing contact sport.\nCareer.\nWalsh began refereeing at age 16 and went on to become the youngest official to make his NPC debut, in the third division, just four years later. He worked as a customs agent and as a salesman before taking up professional refereeing on a full-time basis in 1998.\nInternational referee.\nAt the age of 23, Walsh made his Test refereeing debut on 13 June 1998, when France beat Argentina 35–18 in Buenos Aires. He was the youngest Test referee at the top level at that time. He made his Rugby World Cup debut as a touch judge in 1999.\nHe took control of Tri Nations opener between South Africa and Australia in Cape Town on 12 July 2003.\nWalsh refereed at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He was involved in a verbal altercation with the England fitness coach Dave Reddin in the match against Samoa. Reddin was cleared of misconduct for his part in the incident but was banned from touchline duties for two games for sending winger Dan Luger onto the field against the match official's orders. Walsh was suspended for three days, missing one match, before going on to referee the quarter-final between Australia and Scotland.\nDuring the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in 2005, Irish winger Shane Horgan was called for a knock-on in a match against Taranaki, on touch judge Walsh's advice. Horgan disputed the decision and was met with verbal abuse from Walsh. After the Lions made an official complaint, Walsh was suspended from officiating duties for four months.\nIn 2007 he refereed some notable matches, including the 2007 Super 14 Final, the first international rugby match at Croke Park in Ireland, and refereed four matches at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, including the South Africa v Argentina semi-final.\nWalsh received a third strike on his record, when he was asked to leave a refereeing conference in Sydney after turning up drunk in December 2008. A New Zealand Rugby Union statement in January had said that he would not be considered for the opening month of Super 14 matches. In April 2009, the New Zealand Rugby Union announced that Walsh had retired from his refereeing position.\nMove to Australia.\nWalsh moved to Bondi in Sydney later in 2009. He was offered affiliation to the Australian Rugby Union and began refereeing school rugby and club rugby. He progressed to first grade, refereeing the semi-final between Sydney University and Eastwood, and narrowly missed out on being appointed to the 2009 Shute Shield Grand Final, which was refereed by Stuart Dickinson.\nWalsh was included in the reserve panel of referees for the 2010 Super 14 competition, now representing Australia, and was reappointed to the IRB Elite panel, the highest level, in 2010.\nIn March 2011, he was the referee for the Scotland v Italy match at Murrayfield in the Six Nations Championship. Walsh was appointed to the 2011 Rugby World Cup and refereed several games in New Zealand, representing the Australian Rugby Union.\nHe was the referee for the 2012 Super Rugby Final between the Chiefs and the Sharks in Hamilton. At the end of that year Walsh received the 'Referee of the Year' award during the John Eales Medal ceremony in Sydney.\nRetirement.\nWalsh retired from all levels of refereeing in March 2015 to take up business interests outside the game. He retired holding the record for the most Super Rugby matches refereed at 111, and with the third most Test Matches refereed at 60. His last test match as an official was on 22 November 2014 between France and Argentina, though this was as an assistant referee. His last match as the main referee was on 15 November between England and South Africa at Twickenham Stadium. He was appointed to referee the Wales - Ireland match in the 2015 Six Nations Championship, but withdrew from that match due to business commitments, His final Super Rugby Match as an official was at AAMI Park, between Melbourne Rebels and Brumbies in Round 3 of the 2015 Super Rugby season.\nTattoo.\nWalsh has a tattoo on his left inner forearm which reads 'He who controls himself, controls the game'. During the 2011 Rugby World Cup this tattoo was covered by a flesh-coloured plaster."

        "text": "Super Swing Golf (PangYa! Golf With Style in Europe, and Swing Golf PangYa in Japan) is a Wii version of the online golf game, \"PangYa\". The game was a launch title for the Wii in Japan.\nGameplay.\nWhile very similar to the online \"PangYa\", \"Super Swing Golf\" is slightly different in the areas of control and content. Both the single player and multiplayer game feature three different modes of play. In single player, these include a story mode, stroke play mode, and match mode, while in multiplayer, \"Balloon Pop\" mode replaces the story mode. In all modes, \"Pang\" (currency) can be earned and later spent on additional clothing or gear.\nPlayers use the Wii Remote to scroll and pan around the course, as well as to actually execute shots. To swing, players raise the controller behind them (as with a real golf club) until the on-screen power meter reaches the desired point. Once ready, players then hold down the \"A\" button and swing forward. The angle and speed of the forward swing is used to determine how close the actual shot comes to the desired shot. If the controller is rotated or twisted as the player swings forward, the resulting shot will hook or slice. An alternative control system is to use just the buttons on the Wii Remote similar to how the game is played on the PC, including the same key combinations for power shots.\nThe Wii single-player story mode is named \"PangYa Festa\". Complete with an anime-inspired storyline, the objective of this tournament is to defeat all opponents in match play. Players select a character and then a course, which determines the number of holes, typically 3, 6 or 9, and the opponent. As players successfully defeat opponents, they earn the right to play against more difficult opponents on different courses. Winning a given match also unlocks new characters, caddies, and items which can be purchased in the shop. Before and after each match, the player is greeted with a brief cutscene where the player's character and opponent exchange quips with each other and their caddies.\nReception.\nThe game was met with positive reception. IGN gave it a score of 7.3 out of 10, calling it a fair game with a lot of replay value, but ultimately the rest depended on preference. Yahoo! Games awarded it 4.5/5, saying it was a fun mix between silly swings and serious golf. \"X-Play\" gave it four stars out of five for being fun but very difficult in some areas. GameRankings gave the game a score of 71.40%, while Metacritic gave it 72 out of 100.\nSequel.\nA sequel, \"\", was released on December 11, 2007."

He was a find of Wigan's scout Eric Hawley. Robinson commented later: “Eric Hawley, who was the scout at that time, watched me at Siddal ARLFC and asked me if I wanted to come on a trial basis and have a look round and I decided to sign to the chromatids\", he recalled. “It was under schoolboy terms, but they were binding to the club and to me. I came over once every two or three weeks for training, basically just to familiarise myself until I was sixteen and could move over.\"\nDespite being born in Yorkshire, Luke had supported Wigan Warriors as a kid, his dad taking him to Wembley to watch during the club's glory years.\nLuke progressed through Wigan's scholarship and Academy systems before making his début for the first team at the age of seventeen during the 2002 Super League season. This year he was also selected to play for England Academy. Luke was an England schoolboys international. He played for the England Academy side who were the first ever to beat the Aussie Schoolboys in December 2002.\nDuring 2003, Robinson became a vital part of Wigan's first team squad, often sharing the scrum-half duties with Papua New Guinea star Adrian Lam. Lam picked up a knee injury during a crucial stage of the play-offs that season, leaving Robinson to take sole control the Wigan Warriors pack. Robinson, a supremely confident and exuberant young man, has been likened in style and manner to former Great Britain scrum-half Andy Gregory, and he does admit to sharing the characteristics of brashness and assertiveness famously associated with Gregory. \"I think every scrum-half has got a bit of something in him,\" he said. \"I'm only 5ft 6in and I've got to be bossing Craig Smith, who's 6ft and 17st.\"\nDespite the comparisons with Gregory, Luke has been modelling himself on another Wigan Warriors legend in Adrian Lam. \"I always liked Andy Gregory when I was really young but that was mainly through my dad talking about him,\" he said. \"It was Adrian Lam really. You can't say much more about Adrian Lam, can you?\" However, the England Academy international insists he \"just wants to be Luke Robinson and be the best I can be.\"\nRobinson played for the Wigan Warriors at scrum half back in the 2003 Super League Grand Final which was lost to the Bradford Bulls.\nHe was required again for the first team at the start of 2004 after a further injury to Adrian Lam, however he could not reproduce the form that had helped take Wigan Warriors to the final in the previous season.\nCastleford Tigers (loan).\nWhen Lam recovered Luke was sent on loan to struggling Castleford Tigers. He spent two months at Castleford Tigers before another injury to Lam forced his recall, playing against the Tigers in his first match back at Wigan Warriors.\nSalford City Reds.\nLuke again struggled for form and was eventually allowed to leave Wigan, joining David Hodgson in signing a contract with Salford City Reds. After the deal was done Luke regained the type of form that had created the high hopes for his future, helping Wigan Warriors make it to the 2004 Final Eliminator at Headingley. However, his try was not enough to take the Wigan Warriors to the Grand Final. At the time, many fans were very concerned at the decision to let Luke leave the club.\nLuke Robinson left Wigan Warriors and signed for the Salford City Reds, and was a regular in the first team at Scrum Half. In 2005 Luke scored eleven tries, seven goals, one field goals totalling fifty-nine points for the Salford City Reds. In 2006 he helped them to their highest ever finish (5th) in the Super League, and the first time the club made it to the play-offs.\nHuddersfield Giants.\nHe signed for Huddersfield Giants in September 2007, following Salford City Reds' relegation from Super League.\nInternational.\nWhile at Huddersfield he played for England against the New Zealand Māori at the end of 2010. He played in the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations against New Zealand, Australia and Papua New Guinea games, scoring 2-tries.\nOn 9 February 2016 Robinson announced his retirement from the sport due to a hip injury. and was awarded a Testimonial.\nCoaching.\nHe is currently Head coach of Huddersfield Giants Under 19's Academy team and in 2018, led the team to a first ever grand final semi final, in the end, losing out to eventual champions Wigan Warriors.\nAfter Simon Woolford's resignation Luke was appointed Head Coach of the Huddersfield Giants in September 2020."

Few universities possessed 50-metre pools, and there was a marked reluctance on the part of municipal authorities to build new public long-course facilities. However, the successful bid to hold the 2012 Summer Olympics in London added impetus to the development of new pools. A number of new venues were completed before and after the Games, although some existing pools were demolished and not replaced by 50-metre facilities.\n, no university in the UK possesses an Olympic standard pool, though several have an 8-lane 50-metre pool. The Aberdeen Aquatics Centre, being part funded by the University of Aberdeen, is the main pool facility for the university."

It was certified by the National Labor Relations Board on February 24, 2000, as the World Umpires Association (WUA) as a bargaining agent. It took over as the bargaining agent for MLB umpires after the 2000 MLB season, replacing the Major League Umpires Association (MLUA), which dated back to 1970, and has since been responsible for defending their personnel since. On July 17, 2018, it rebranded itself as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association.\nFormation.\nThe MLUA, led by longtime negotiating attorney Richie Phillips, was decertified by its member umpires (by a vote of 57 to 35) in February 2000, after Phillips' strategy of mass resignations in September 1999 backfired, with MLB simply accepting many of the resignations and promoting new umpires from the minor leagues. The WUA was created immediately afterward. Its first president was working umpire John Hirschbeck, who held the position from 2000 to 2009. He was replaced by Joe West in February 2009.\nThe formation of the WUA allowed longtime umpires Derryl Cousins and John Shulock to finally join the umpires' union. They were denied membership by the MLUA due to crossing the picket line during the 1979 umpires' strike. \nIn December 2009, the WUA reached an agreement with MLB on a five-year labor agreement, to run through December 2014 – members of the union voted to ratify the contract in January 2010. A new labor contract was subsequently ratified in January 2015 and ran until the end of 2019.\nOn July 17, 2018, the union rebranded itself as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association.\nLeadership.\nAs of 2021, board members Bill Miller (President), Ted Barrett (Vice-President), and Dan Bellino (Secretary/Treasurer) make up the executive board for the union. Will Little, Laz Díaz, Chris Conroy, Chris Guccione, Tom Hallion, and Tim Timmons compose the remainder of the governing body. All members of the governing and executive boards are active umpires. Legal counsel for the union is Altshuler Berzon, LLP of San Francisco, California."

        "text": "Neil Smith (born April 10, 1966) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1988 to 1996, the Denver Broncos from 1997 to 1999, and the San Diego Chargers in 2000. Before his NFL career, he played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, where he was an All-American in 1987. He also co-owned an Arena Football team, the Kansas City Command.\nEarly years.\nBorn in New Orleans, Smith graduated from McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School in the city.\nProfessional career.\nThe Chiefs, who had the third pick, made it known to everyone before the 1988 NFL draft that they intended to take Smith. The Detroit Lions, picking second, threatened to pick Smith and the Chiefs were forced to move up one slot to make sure that Smith would be their pick. Incidentally, one of the draft picks the Chiefs surrendered in order to move up turned out to be star linebacker Chris Spielman. Smith's pre-draft measurables were head-turning. He was 6'4½\", weighed 260 pounds, had a 7-foot-1½-inch arm span, and ran a 4.55 forty-yard dash.\nLegacy.\nOne of the top defensive linemen of his era, Smith made the Pro Bowl 6 times during his career (1991–1995 and 1997), and led the NFL with 15 sacks in the 1993 season. With the Broncos, Smith won 2 NFL championship rings for Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII. In the 1998 Divisional Playoffs against the Miami Dolphins, Smith cemented the 38-3 Broncos victory with a 79-yard fumble return for a touchdown, and in Super Bowl XXXII, he recorded a key fumble recovery that set up a Broncos field goal.\nSmith finished his 13 NFL seasons with 104.5 sacks, 30 forced fumbles, 12 fumble recoveries, 19 return yards, and 1 touchdown. He also intercepted 4 passes, returning them for 68 yards and a touchdown. He is the former co-owner of the Kansas City Brigade of the Arena Football League.\nOn October 22, 2006, Smith was inducted to the Chiefs's Hall of Fame.\nNotes.\nSmith's trademark sack celebration, which consisted of him pantomiming swinging a baseball bat, was invented in tribute to another Kansas City sports hero, Hall Of Famer George Brett.\nThere was a rule created in his name. The \"Neil Smith\" rule, enacted in 1998, prevents a defensive lineman from flinching to induce a false start penalty on the offense.\nNeil Smith was a Co-Owner of the Kansas City Brigade, a team in the Arena Football League from 2006 until 2008.\nSmith appeared as a panelist on the Nickelodeon game show \"Figure it Out\". He also appeared in a series of Campbell's Chunky Soup commercials.\nThe Kansas City Command retired #90 in his honor."

Young had a very solid rookie season, earning 106 points in 69 games, helping the 67's to the playoffs. In seven playoff games, Young had five points. After the season, Young was drafted by the New England Whalers in the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft with the 13th overall pick.\nRather than join the Whalers, Young returned to Ottawa for the 1974–75 season, in which he led the league with 106 assists, and the second highest point total at 163, behind only Bruce Boudreau of the Toronto Marlboros. In the playoffs, Young had seven points in five games as the 67's lost to the Sudbury Wolves in the first round. Young was then selected 16th overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1975 NHL Entry Draft. He would not stay a King for long, as on August 15, 1975, the Kings traded Young to the Minnesota North Stars for Minnesota's second round choice in the 1976 NHL Entry Draft.\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota North Stars.\nYoung began the 1975–76 season with the New Haven Nighthawks of the American Hockey League (AHL), earning 20 points in 13 games before being called up to the North Stars. He had a solid rookie season in Minnesota, earning 51 points in 63 games to lead the team in scoring. The North Stars failed to reach the playoffs.\nYoung had a breakout season in 1976–77, as he once again led the North Stars in scoring with a career high 95 points, as he scored 29 goals with 66 assists, and played in the 30th National Hockey League All-Star Game. Young helped the North Stars reach the preliminary round of the playoffs, however, Minnesota was swept in two games by the Buffalo Sabres. Young had a goal and an assist in the series.\nThe 1977–78 season saw Young's numbers slip, as he recorded 58 points in 78 games, and finished second in team scoring. Minnesota struggled throughout the season, and failed to make the post-season. The 1978–79 season was more of the same, as Young had 56 points in 73 games, as Minnesota once again missed the playoffs. \nThe highlight of Young's season came on January 15, 1979 when he scored five goals in a game at the New York Rangers. It was his first career hat trick and he also added an assist for a six-point night. In doing so, he became just the second player in NHL history to score five goals on five shots. \nIn 1979–80, Young had his highest point total since 1976-77, as he earned 74 points in 77 games, helping the North Stars to a record over .500 for the first time since he joined the team, and a playoff berth. In the post-season, Young had seven points in 15 games, as Minnesota lost in the third round to the Philadelphia Flyers.\nYoung continued to play good hockey in the 1980–81 season, as he had 66 points in 74 games to finish second in team scoring, as Minnesota made the playoffs again. The North Stars had a long playoff run, advancing to the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals, before losing to the powerful New York Islanders in five games. Young missed some time in the playoffs, however, he had a strong playoff performance, earning 17 points in only 12 games.\nYoung had an injury plagued 1981–82 season, a season in which he was named captain of the North Stars, appearing in only 49 games, in which he earned 41 points. In the playoffs, Young had two points in four games. In 1982-83, Young stayed relatively healthy, as he played in 70 games, earning 53 points, however he appeared in only two playoff games, earning two assists.\nOn August 3, 1983, the North Stars traded Young to the Winnipeg Jets for Craig Levie and Tom Ward.\nWinnipeg Jets.\nIn Young's only season in Winnipeg in 1983–84, he appeared in only 44 games, earning 34 points, as the Jets snuck into the playoffs. Young appeared in only one playoff game, earning an assist.\nOn October 16, 1984, Young was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for future considerations.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nInjuries continued to take a toll on Young's career, as he split the 1984–85 season between Philadelphia and the Hershey Bears of the AHL. In 20 games with the Flyers, Young had eight points before finishing the season with the Bears. Young was productive with Hershey, earning 48 points in 49 games, however, he decided to retire at the conclusion of the season at the age of 30."

        "text": "India sent a delegation to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy from 10–26 February 2006. This was the nation's seventh appearance in a Winter Olympic Games. The Indian delegation consisted of four athletes, two in alpine skiing, one in cross-country skiing, and one in luge. Their best performance in any event was 25th by luger Shiva Keshavan in the men's singles.\nBackground.\nThe Indian Olympic Association was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1926. However, by this time, they had already competed in three Summer Olympic Games, in 1900, 1920, and 1924. India has participated in every Summer Olympics since 1920. The nation did not make its first Winter Olympics appearance until the 1964 Winter Olympics. With India missing the Winter Olympics from 1972–1984 and in 1994, Turin marked India's seventh appearance at a Winter Olympics. The 2006 Winter Olympics were held from 10–26 February; a total of 2,508 athletes representing 80 National Olympic Committees took part. The Indian delegation to Turin consisted of four athletes, two in alpine skiing, one in cross-country skiing, and one in luge. Alpine skier Neha Ahuja was the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nNeha Ahuja was 24 years old at the time of these Olympics, and was making her Olympic debut. On 22 February, she competed in the women's slalom, finishing her first run in 55.45 seconds, and her second in 1 minute and 0.71 seconds. Her combined time was 1 minute and 56.16 seconds, placing her last among the 51 competitors who finished both legs of the race; the gold medal was won by Sweden Anja Pärson in 1 minute and 29.04 seconds; the silver was taken by Austrian Nicole Hosp and the bronze by her fellow Austrian Marlies Schild. On 24 February, Ahuja took part in the women's giant slalom, finishing her first run in 1 minute and 15.59 seconds and her second in 1 minutes and 25.72 seconds. Her total time was 2 minutes and 41.31 seconds, putting her in 42nd place out of 43 classified finishers. The gold medal was won by Julia Mancuso of the United States in 2 minutes and 9.19 seconds; the silver by Tanja Poutiainen of Finland, and the bronze was won by Swede Anna Ottosson.\nHira Lal was 25 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and was also making his Olympic debut. He competed in the men's giant slalom on 20 February, but did not finish the first run. The gold medal in this race was won by Benjamin Raich of Austria, the silver was taken by Joël Chenal of France, and the bronze was won by a second Austrian, Hermann Maier.\nCross-country skiing.\nBahadur Gupta was 29 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and making his only Olympic appearance. In the qualifying round of the men's sprint on 22 February, he finished the race with a time of 2 minutes and 43.30 seconds, and he was 78th out of 80 competitors to finish. Only the top 30 qualified for the next round, and Gupta was eliminated, the slowest qualifying time was 2 minutes and 20.46 seconds. The gold medal was eventually won by Björn Lind of Sweden, the silver by Roddy Darragon of France, and the silver by Thobias Fredriksson, also of Sweden.\nLuge.\nShiva Keshavan was 24 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and was making his third Olympic appearance, after representing India at the 1998 Nagano Olympics and the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. The men's singles was held on 11–12 February, and was held over four runs, two runs on each day. The final placement was determined by adding up all the run times for each athlete. On the first day, Keshavan finished the first run in a time of 53.729 seconds, and the second in 52.972 seconds. Overnight, he was in 29th place out of 36 competitors. The next day, he posted run times of 52.696 seconds and 52.540 seconds. Overall, the sum of his run times was 3 minutes and 31.937 seconds, which meant he finished in 25th place out of 35 lugers who completed all four runs. The gold medal was won by Armin Zöggeler of Italy in a time of 3 minutes and 26.088 seconds; the silver medal was taken by Albert Demchenko of Russia, and the bronze by Mārtiņš Rubenis of Latvia. Keshavan would go on to represent his country at the 2010, 2014, and the 2018 Winter Olympics. "

The Irish delegation to Turin consisted of four athletes, two alpine skiers, one cross-country skier, and one skeleton racer. The best performance by any Irish competitor at these Olympics was 20th, by David Connolly in the men's skeleton race. The Bobsleigh team, Ireland’s first and only at the Olympics finished 24th, driven by Peter O’Malley with John O’Donoghue on Breaks and the brothers Joe and Patrick Mullins rounding out the crew.\nBackground.\nThe Olympic Council of Ireland was first recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1921. With the exception of the 1936 Summer Olympics they have entered a team in every Summer Olympic Games since. However, Ireland did not join Winter Olympics competition until the 1992 Winter Olympics, and Turin was marking their fourth appearance at a Winter Games, having skipped the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. The Irish delegation to Turin consisted of four athletes, two alpine skiers, one cross-country skier, and one skeleton racer. All four of Ireland's athletes at Turin were first-time Olympians. Alpine skier Kirsten McGarry was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and cross-country skier Rory Morrish was selected as the flag bearer for the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nThomas Foley was 26 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics. His only event, the men's giant slalom, was held on 20 February. He finished the first run in a time of 1 minute and 28.28 seconds, and the second in 1 minute and 29.14 seconds. His combined time was 2 minutes and 57.42 seconds, good for 31st place out of 41 competitors who finished both legs of the race. The gold medal was won by Benjamin Raich of Austria in a time of 2 minutes and 35 seconds, the silver medal was taken by Joël Chenal of France and the bronze by Austrian Hermann Maier.\nKirsten McGarry was 20 years old at the time of these Olympics, and would later represent Ireland again at the 2010 Winter Olympics. She described herself as \"very nervous\" coming into the Olympics. She was scheduled to compete in the women's super-G but ultimately did not start the race, as the weather conditions were poor and the Super-G was not considered her best discipline. The gold medal was won by Austrian Michaela Dorfmeister, the silver by Croatian Janica Kostelić and the bronze was taken by Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer. On 22 February, she did compete in the \nwomen's slalom, posting run times of 49.64 seconds and 52.79 seconds. Her combined time of 1 minute and 42.43 seconds put her in 42nd place, out of 51 competitors who finished both legs of the race; the gold medal was won by Sweden's Anja Pärson in 1 minute and 29.04 seconds, the silver and bronze medals were taken by two Austrians, Nicole Hosp and Marlies Schild. She also participated in the women's giant slalom on 24 February. She posted a first run time of 1 minute and 8.19 seconds and completed her second run in 1 minute and 14.68 seconds. McGarry's total time was 2 minutes and 22.87 seconds, which was good for 32nd place out of 43 classified finishers. Gold was won by Julia Mancuso of the United States in 2 minutes and 9.19 seconds, silver by Tanja Poutiainen of Finland, and bronze was taken by Sweden's Anna Ottosson.\nCross-country skiing.\nRory Morrish was 38 years old at the time of these Olympics. He came to the sport of cross-country skiing after previously competing at the world championships in ski-orienteering. In the men's 15 kilometre classical he finished with a time of 50 minutes and 28.1 seconds, which saw him ranked 87th out of 96 classified finishers. The gold medal was won by Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu in 38 minutes and 1.3 seconds, the silver was won by Lukáš Bauer of the Czech Republic and bronze by the German Tobias Angerer.\nSkeleton.\nDavid Connolly was 25 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics. In the men's skeleton held on 17 February, he finished his first run in 59.97 seconds, and his second in one minute flat. His total time of 1 minute and 59.97 seconds put him in 20th place out of 27 competitors in the event. The gold medal was won by Canada's Duff Gibson in 1 minute and 55.88 seconds, the silver by fellow Canadian Jeff Pain, and the bronze was taken by Gregor Stähli of Switzerland."

        "title": "Major League Baseball Game of the Week",
        "text": "The Major League Baseball Game of the Week (GOTW) is the de facto title for nationally televised coverage of regular season Major League Baseball games. \"The Game of the Week\" has traditionally aired on Saturday afternoons. When the national networks began televising national games of the week, it opened the door for a national audience to see particular clubs. While most teams were broadcast, emphasis was always on the league leaders and the major market franchises that could draw the largest audience.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n1950s.\nIn 1953, ABC-TV executive Edgar J. Scherick (who would later go on to create \"Wide World of Sports\") broached a Saturday \"Game of the Week\"- baseball's first regular-season network telecast. At the time, ABC was labeled a \"nothing network\" that had fewer outlets than CBS or NBC. ABC also needed paid programming or \"anything for bills\" as Scherick put it. At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program.\nIn April 1953, Scherick set out to acquire broadcasting rights from various major league clubs, but only got the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox to sign on. To make matters worse, Major League Baseball blacked out the \"Game of the Week\" on any TV stations within 50 miles of a ballpark. Major League Baseball, according to Scherick, insisted on protecting local coverage and didn't care about national appeal. ABC though, did care about the national appeal and claimed that \"most of America was still up for grabs.\"\nIn 1953, ABC earned an 11.4 rating for their \"Game of the Week\" telecasts. Blacked-out cities had 32 percent of households. In the rest of the United States, 3 in 4 TV sets in use watched Dizzy Dean and Buddy Blattner call the games for ABC.\nIn 1955, CBS took over the Saturday broadcasts, adding Sunday telecasts in 1957. Dean and Blattner continued to call the games for CBS, with Pee Wee Reese replacing Blattner in 1960. Gene Kirby, who had worked with Dean and Blattner at ABC and Mutual radio, also contributed to the CBS telecasts as a producer and announcer. \nNBC began its own Saturday and Sunday coverage in 1957 and 1959, respectively. In 1960, ABC resumed Saturday telecasts; that year the \"Big 3\" networks aired a combined 123 games.\n1960s.\nBy 1965, Major League Baseball ended \"Game of the Week\" blackouts in cities with MLB clubs. Other cities within fifty miles of an MLB stadium got $6.5 million for exclusivity, and split the pot. ABC provided the first-ever nationwide baseball coverage with weekly Saturday broadcasts on a regional basis. ABC paid $5.7 million for the rights to the 28 Saturday/holiday \"Games of the Week\". ABC's deal covered all of the teams except the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies (who had their own television deals) and called for three regionalized games on Saturdays, Independence Day, and Labor Day. ABC blacked out the games in the home cities of the clubs playing those games. Chris Schenkel, Keith Jackson, and Merle Harmon were the principal play-by-play announcers for ABC's coverage.\nWeekly Yankees games were broadcast on CBS, as the team had been acquired by the network before the 1965 season. \nNBC's \"Game of the Week\".\n1960s.\nIn 1966, the Yankees joined NBC's package, as did the Phillies. The new package under NBC called for 28 games.\nOn October 19, 1966, NBC signed a new three-year contract with Major League Baseball. Under the new deal, NBC paid roughly $6 million per year for 25 Saturday games and prime-time contests on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day; $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and 1967 All-Star Game; and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts) up to $30.6 million.\nA black and white kinescope (saved by Armed Forces Television) of a July 12, 1969 between the Philles and Chicago Cubs]] is believed to be the oldest surviving complete telecast of the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\".\n1970s.\nIn 1976, NBC paid US$10.7 million per year to show 25 Saturday \"Games of the Week\" and half of the postseason (both League Championship Series in odd numbered years and World Series in even numbered years). ABC would carry a \"Monday Night Baseball\" game (later switched to a combination of Sunday afternoon games in the early and later part of the season and a Monday night game in the rest) and the other half of the postseason. NBC and ABC would continue this particular arrangement through 1989.\nJoe Garagiola was promoted to succeed Curt Gowdy as NBC's top play-by-play announcer in a team with color commentator Tony Kubek in 1976.\n1980s.\nWhen NBC inked a new $550 million contract for six years in the fall of 1982, a return on the investment demanded Vin Scully to be their star baseball announcer. Scully was paired with Garagiola as the top broadcast team. Prior to 1983, Scully's only announcing jobs for NBC were the 1966 World Series and 1974 World Series, which both involved the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Scully was the regular local play-by-play announcer.\nTony Kubek was teamed with Bob Costas as the secondary announce team in 1983. The team of Costas and Kubek proved to be a formidable pair. There were even some who preferred the team of Kubek and Costas over the musings of Vin Scully and the asides of Joe Garagiola.\nOne of Bob Costas and Tony Kubek's most memorable broadcasts came on June 23, 1984. The duo were at Wrigley Field to call a game between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. Led by second baseman Ryne Sandberg, the Cubs rallied from a 9–3 deficit before winning it in extra innings. After Sandberg hit his second home run in the game (with two out in the bottom of the 9th to tie it 11–11), Costas cried \"That's the real Roy Hobbs because this can't be happening! We're sitting here, and it doesn't make any difference if it's 1984 or '54-just freeze this and don't change a thing!\"\nIn 1985, NBC got a break when Major League Baseball dictated a policy that no local game could be televised at the same time that a network \"Game of the Week\" was being broadcast. Additionally, for the first time, NBC was able to feed the \"Game of the Week\" telecasts to the two cities whose local teams participated. In time, MLB teams whose Saturday games were not scheduled for the \"Game of the Week\" would move the start time of their Saturday games to avoid conflict with the NBC network game, and thus, make it available to local television in the team's home city (and the visiting team's home city as well).\nThe end of an era.\nOn December 14, 1988, CBS paid approximately $1.8 billion for exclusive over-the-air television rights for over four years beginning in 1990. CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday \"Game of the Week\".\nThe final regular season edition of NBC's \"Game of the Week\" was televised on September 30, 1989. That game featured the Toronto Blue Jays beating the Baltimore Orioles 4–3 to clinch the AL East title from the SkyDome. It was the 981st edition of NBC's \"Game of the Week\" overall.\nNBC's final game of the year was televised on October 9, 1989. It was Game 5 of the 1989 National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs from Candlestick Park. At the end of the telecast, game announcer Vin Scully said \"It's a passing of a great American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that. It will leave a vast window, to use a Washington word, where people will not get Major League Baseball and I think that's a tragedy. It's a staple that's gone. I feel for people who come to me and say how they miss it, and I hope me.\"\nBob Costas said \"Who thought baseball'd kill its best way to reach the public? It coulda kept us and CBS-we'd have kept the \"Game\"-but it only cared about cash.\" Costas added that he would rather do a \"Game of the Week\" that got a 5 rating than host a Super Bowl. \"Whatever else I did, I'd never have left \"Game of the Week\"\" Costas claimed.\nNotable \"Game of the Week\" broadcast on NBC.\nOn April 7, 1984, the Detroit Tigers' Jack Morris threw a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park; the game was the 1984 season opener for NBC's baseball coverage, and it was the only no-hit game thrown in the series' history.\nCBS takes over (1990–1993).\nCBS took over MLB broadcasts with the 1990 season. However, the network alienated and confused fans with their sporadic treatment of regular season telecasts. CBS televised 16 regular season Saturday afternoon games each season (not counting back-up telecasts), which was 14 fewer than what NBC televised during the previous contract. CBS employed the strategy of airing only a select number of games in part because the network had a number of other weekend summer sports commitments, most notably PGA Tour golf; and partly to build up viewer demand in response to supposedly sagging ratings. In addition, CBS angered fans by largely ignoring the divisional pennant races; instead, their scheduled games focused on games featuring major-market teams, regardless of their record.\nNBC play-by-play man Bob Costas believed that a large bulk of the regular-season coverage beginning in the 1990s shifted to cable (namely, ESPN) because CBS did not really want the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" and that they were only truly after the marquee events (i.e. All-Star Game, League Championship Series, and the World Series) in order to sell advertising space (especially the fall entertainment television schedule). The league and network chose not to renew their contract after the 1993 season, and CBS has not broadcast Major League Baseball in any fashion since.\nHiatus period (1994–1995).\nIn 1994 and 1995, there was no traditional Saturday \"Game of the Week\" coverage. In those two seasons, The Baseball Network (a joint venture by MLB, NBC and ABC) utilized a purely regional schedule of 12 games per week that could only be seen based on the viewer's local affiliate. The arrangement proved to be unpopular and, coupled with the 1994 strike, led to the joint venture being abandoned after only two years.\nThe Fox era (1996–present).\nMajor League Baseball made a deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company on November 7, 1995. Fox paid a fraction less of the amount of money that CBS paid for the Major League Baseball television rights for the 1990 through 1993 seasons. Unlike The Baseball Network arrangement, Fox reverted to the format of televising regular season games (approximately 16 weekly telecasts that normally began on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons. Fox's initial approach was to offer four regionalized telecasts, with exclusivity from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. in each time zone.\nLike NBC and CBS before it, Fox determined its Saturday schedule by who was playing a team from one of the three largest television markets: New York City, Los Angeles, or Chicago. If there was a game which combined two of these three markets, it would be aired.\nIn Fox's first season of Major League Baseball coverage in 1996, they averaged a 2.7 rating for its Saturday telecasts. That was down 23% from CBS' 3.4 in 1993 despite the latter network's infamy for its rather haphazard \"Game of the Week\" schedule.\nIn 2004, Fox's \"Game of the Week\" telecasts only appeared three times after August 28, due to ratings competition from college football (especially since Fox affiliates may have had syndicated college football broadcasts). By that point, Joe Buck, Fox's lead baseball play-by-play announcer, was unavailable to call baseball games, since he had become Fox's top NFL announcer. The following two seasons saw similar interruptions in Fox's September coverage.\nFox renewed its contract in 2006. One of the terms of the deal was that, beginning with the 2007 season, the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" coverage was extended over the entire season rather than starting after Memorial Day, with most games being aired in the 3:30–7:00 p.m. (EDT) time slot.\nIn 2014, the Fox Sports 1 cable network began airing regular-season games over 26 Saturdays. As a result, MLB regular season coverage on the over the air Fox network was reduced to 12 weeks. \nIn 2022, as part of their renewal of rights, Fox agreed to increase their coverage on the broadcast network. Most weeks of the season Fox exclusively airs two or three prime time games in regional coverage as part of their \"Baseball Night in America\" broadcasts, with FS1 carrying a non-exclusive Saturday afternoon game. During September, when the Saturday evening games conflict with Fox's college football obligations, the network carries Thursday night games instead.\nThe \"Game of the Week\" on radio.\nFrom 1985 to 1997, CBS Radio aired its own incarnation of the \"Game of the Week\", broadcasting games at various times on Saturday afternoons and/or Sunday nights. In 1998, national radio rights went to ESPN Radio, which airs Saturday games during the season as well as \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and Opening Day and holiday broadcasts.\nEarlier, the Mutual and Liberty networks had aired \"Game of the Day\" broadcasts to non-major-league cities in the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\"A\" game and \"B\" games.\nDuring NBC's era of \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts, the network actually carried two games, the \"A\" game was generally broadcast to approximately 80% of the country. The \"B\" game (also known as the \"backup game\") generally existed as a backup in case of rainouts or other delays at the A game.\nPrior to \"Game of the Week\" being given exclusivity in the 1980s, NBC typically had the A game broadcast to most of the country, but not to the markets of the participating teams, while the B game was aired in the home markets of the teams in the A game. In those days, the TV rules did not allow a market to see its local team play on NBC. However, in situations where one game got rained out, the rules would be relaxed. When \"Game of the Week\" gained exclusivity, allowing for airing games in the teams' home markets, the B game normally only aired in the participants' home markets."

They won one gold medal, in ice hockey.\nIce hockey.\nThe Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) chose the Toronto Granites as the 1923 Allan Cup champions to represent Canada in ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics, and W. A. Hewitt was chosen oversee the national team's finances at the Olympics. Hewitt was empowered by the CAHA to name replacement players as needed, and recruited Harold McMunn and Cyril Slater as replacements when four players from the Granites were unable to travel to the Olympics. In his weekly report to the \"Toronto Daily Star\", Hewitt wrote that the Granites would face multiple changes in conditions compared to hockey games in Canada. He did not feel the team would be affected by playing outdoors on natural ice in the morning or afternoon, despite that the team was accustomed to playing indoors with electric lighting on artificial ice. He also felt that the larger ice surface and lack of boards around the sides of the rink would mean more stick handling and less physical play.\nDuring the Olympics, Hewitt attended the annual meeting and elections for the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). Since its rules stated that one of the vice-presidents must be from North America, Hewitt and United States Amateur Hockey Association president William S. Haddock opted for a coin toss, which decided that Haddock was elected to the position. When the Olympics organizers wanted to select hockey referees by drawing names out of a hat, Hewitt and Haddock agreed to another coin toss to decide on the referee for the game between Canada and the United States men's national team. Hewitt feared having an inexperienced referee for the game, and his suggested to have LIHG president Paul Loicq officiate the game was confirmed by the coin toss.

        "title": "Flick (fencing)",
        "text": "The flick is a technique used in modern fencing. It is used in foil and to a lesser extent, épée. \nThe 1980s saw the widespread use of \"flicks\" — hits delivered with a whipping motion which bends the blade around the more traditional parries, and makes it possible to touch otherwise inaccessible areas, such as the back of the opponent. This has been regarded by some fencers as an unacceptable departure from the tradition of realistic combat, where only rigid blades would be used, while others feel that the flick adds to the variety of possible attacks and targets, thereby expanding the game of foil. \nTechnique.\nThe flick consists of an angulated attack with a whipping motion that requires the defender to make a widened parry, and exploits the flexibility of the blade. If parried, a properly executed flick whips the attacker's blade around the parry. This is a valid strategy in modern fencing, since any depression of the tip with sufficient force while contacting valid target area constitutes a touch. In pre-modern fencing, judging was done by side judges, so a touch had to land and stick long enough to be reliably counted.\nThe flick should not be confused with \"whipover\" attacks, which occur in sabre when an attack is struck with such force that the blade \"whips over\" the opponent's blade when parried.\nConsequences.\nThe advent of the flick, among other factors, has caused the gap between classical and modern fencing to widen. In classical fencing, the touch scored with the flick is seen as cheating, because the fencer has changed the shape of his blade. Also, even most professionals cannot land their flick at every attempt. It takes much practice. If executed properly, a flick can displace the point by bending the blade to such a degree so that the tip of the blade is at angle of almost ninety degrees from the forte of the blade. This significant change allows for an otherwise impossible touch. For these reasons, the flick is the subject of much controversy. As of 2005, timing of fencing equipment has been changed to lengthen the time necessary that the weapon's point is pressed against the target for a valid touch to register. This was done to reduce the use of the flick and encourage the use of more traditional thrusts. This change is widely controversial, as it changes more of the game than just the ability to flick (such as giving fencers the ability to \"lock-out\" a riposte). Still, though, more skilled fencers have been able to continue using flicks in their tactics, although much less than before.\nIronically, flicks were not entirely an artifact of electronic scoring. In 1896, The Lancet published an account of \nan early \"electric scorer\" and claimed among its advantages, that \"flicks, or blows, or grazes produce no result.\" Nevertheless, it is the introduction of electronic scoring to high-level competitive foil in the 1950s that is often blamed for the rise in the flick's popularity. In 2004-2005, in an effort to curtail the use of flicks, the FIE raised the contact time required to trigger the scoring apparatus from 3±2 milliseconds to the current 15±1 milliseconds. This has not made flicks impossible, but it has made them more technically demanding, as glancing hits no longer register, and it is essential that the point arrives more or less square-on. Before the rule was changed, the blade could bend more easily so the back and flanks were easier to hit and score.\n2005 Timing Specifications: The new 2005 timings have increased the Impact Time from 1-5 ms to 13-15 ms, and decreased the Blocking Time from 750 +/-50 ms to 300 +/-25 ms. Thus, the blocking time has been effectively halved. This leads to situations (described above) where a riposte is \"locked out\". 'Lock-out' refers to the mechanism of the electronic scoring system which disallows additional touches after a certain margin of time after the first hit."

        "text": "Marc Christopher Gwynne Ellis (born 8 October 1971) is a New Zealand businessman, television presenter, and former rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. A graduate of the University of Otago, his primary business interest was in Charlie's, a juice company. During the 1995 Rugby World Cup he scored six tries in the game against Japan, which is the record for the most tries by an individual in a Rugby World Cup match.\nNPC.\nEllis started out for Otago in the NPC in 1991 when he was playing for the club side University, and he was selected for the NZ Colts. He made a name for himself while playing for Otago, which earned him All Black selection in 1992. Ellis stayed with Otago until 1995 when he switched code to rugby league. In 1998, after two seasons of league, Ellis played for North Harbour in the NPC, where he remained for another two seasons. Ellis played his last season of NPC in 2000 for North Harbour.\nAll Blacks.\nEllis first played for the All Blacks in 1992, against a South Australian Invitation XV, then against Australian club and invitation sides. He scored two tries in his first test, in 1993, at first five-eighth against Scotland, won 51–15 by the All Blacks. A week later he was selected for the test against England where he also played first five. Ellis played his last match of 1993 against the Barbarians. For the 1994 season, Ellis was not selected for the All Blacks and did not attend the NZ trial due to injury, but he did play for the New Zealand XV and New Zealand Universities sides. In 1995 Ellis was re-called to the All Blacks for the World Cup, playing five games on the wing. He scored seven tries in the tournament, six of them in the 145–17 win over Japan.\nRugby league.\nAt the end of the 1995 season Ellis switched to league to play for the Auckland Warriors where he joined his All Blacks teammate John Kirwan. Ellis was Warrior number 29 when he played his first match in 1996. He played for the Warriors between 1996 and 1998, playing in 36 matches and scoring 103 points through 11 tries, 29 goals and 1 field goal. \nEllis also represented the New Zealand national rugby league team, the Kiwis, in 5 matches.\nSuper 12.\nEllis missed out on the first few seasons of the Super 12 due to his rugby league career, but when he returned to rugby union in 1998 it was only a short time before he was into the Super 12. After playing a solid season for North Harbour in the NPC Ellis was picked for the Blues, where he played one season. In 1999, after strong seasons with North Harbour and the Blues, Ellis was named in one of the early training squads for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, but he was not selected in the final team and played for NZ A instead. In 2000 Ellis played his final Super 12 season for the Highlanders before retiring from rugby.\nPost playing career.\nIn the early 2000s, Ellis was a popular figure on New Zealand television, often appearing alongside fellow former rugby union and league player Matthew Ridge, notably on light-hearted documentaries. In 2004, as part of a one such programme, Ellis took part in and won the famous and eccentric British annual event, the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake.\nFrom 1996 to 2005 Ellis was a regular presenter on the TV2 talk show \"SportsCafe\", where he was known for his \"larrikin\" personality. In 2003 he inaugurated the mock public holiday \"National Nude Day\" by challenging viewers to streak in front of then Prime Minister Helen Clark.\nIn 2006, he released his autobiography \"Crossing the Line\", which details all aspects of his life. Ellis has since co-authored \"Good Fullas: A Guide to Kiwi Blokes\", released in 2010 with friend and New Zealand Consul General to Italy, Charlie Haddrell.\nIn 2010 the Gardens Tavern, then a popular student pub in North Dunedin, was advertised for sale; Ellis attempted to buy it but was outbid by the University of Otago, who converted it into a study centre. The university student magazine \"Critic\" alleges that the University bought it for the specific purpose of keeping it out of Ellis' hands.\nControversy.\nIn 2005, Ellis purchased ecstasy tablets from a drug dealer who was under surveillance by the New Zealand Police. Ellis was among many high-profile figures caught in the operation, code-named Aqua. His court appearance put an end to a poorly-kept secret, as despite the fact he had originally obtained name suppression, his identity was widely known by the New Zealand public. Ellis was fined $300.\nOn 15 November 2007, as part of an elaborate marketing ploy for his latest business venture, Ellis detonated 600 kg of explosives on top of Rangitoto Island, a nature reserve in Auckland's Waitematā Harbour. This was an attempt to create an illusion that the volcanic island was erupting. The New Zealand Department of Conservation described the stunt as \"demoralising and very disappointing\". There is a total fire ban on the island because of ecological significance."

As a result, Hewitt became one of only two defending Wimbledon men's singles champions to lose in the first round of their defence, the other being Manuel Santana in 1967. As per tradition, the defending champion Hewitt was playing the opening match on Centre Court – a situation he had willingly avoided the previous year (when the reigning champion Goran Ivanišević withdrew) out of fear of the unpredictability of fresh grass.\nWith the losses of Hewitt, Andre Agassi and Juan Carlos Ferrero in the fourth round, a first-time major champion was guaranteed.

After two seasons, with the groups, it introduced one legged semi-finals taking place after the group stage, meaning the two sides qualified from each group as group winners playing the semi-finals at home.\nThis edition was marked by the absence of Yugoslav participants because Yugoslavia was under UN economic sanctions. Yugoslav participants were frequently present in advanced stages of the competition with Red Star Belgrade having won the European Cup in 1991 and finished second in the group the following season. FK Partizan were to represent Yugoslavia in this edition, but were not allowed to participate. Meanwhile, Croatia, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia and Wales entered their champions for the first time in this edition.\nTeams.\n42 national champions participated in 1993–94 UEFA Champions League season. 20 lowest-ranked of them by 1993 UEFA club ranking entered in the Preliminary Round, 22 best-ranked champions entered in the First Round.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows. All draws were held in Geneva, Switzerland.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage began on 24 November 1993 and ended on 13 April 1994. The eight teams were divided into two groups of four, and the teams in each group played against each other on a home-and-away basis, meaning that each team played a total of six group matches. For each win, teams were awarded two points, with one point awarded for each draw. At the end of the group stage, the two teams in each group with the most points advanced to the semi-finals.\nAll teams except Milan and Porto made their group stage debuts. Two of these teams (Barcelona and Anderlecht) had previously contested the 1991–92 group stage, the only season of the European Cup to adopt such a format.\nTop goalscorers.\nThe top scorers from the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League (excluding preliminary round) are as follows:"

        "text": "David Marsh (born December 29, 1958) is the associate head coach at University of California, Berkeley and head coach of Team Elite in San Diego, California, and the ‘Professional Adviser’ of the Israel Swimming Association.\nMarsh worked to build Team Elite under SwimMAC Carolina since 2007. Prior to founding Team Elite he was the men's and women's swimming coach at Auburn University. After becoming head coach of Auburn in 1990, Marsh led the men's team to seven NCAA national championships (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007) and the women's team to five national championships (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007). He finished his coaching career at Auburn at the conclusion of the 2007 season, after which he became the Head Elite Coach and CEO of the United States Olympic Committee Center of Excellence with SwimMAC Carolina. To date, Marsh has led SwimMAC to three consecutive USA club excellence championships, a first for any program, outdistancing the second-place finisher by 12,000 points (see www.usaswimming.org). He was the head swim coach for University of California San Diego, an NCAA Division II program for two seasons from 2017 to 2019.\nThe internationally known coach has coached 49 Olympians from 19 countries. In December 2016 Marsh was named the ‘Professional Adviser’ of the Israel Swimming Association, with a goal of preparing the country's swimmers for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\nEarly life.\nMarsh is originally from Miami, Florida and received his degree in Business Administration from Auburn in 1981. Marsh was a five-time All-American backstroker at Auburn.\nSuccess at Auburn.\nMarsh has won 17 SEC titles (13 men and 4 women), by far the most of any Auburn coach or team.\nIn 2003 he led both the men's and women's teams to a sweep of the NCAA titles, a first in collegiate Swimming and Diving. Marsh and the Tigers went on to repeat this accomplishment three more times (2004, 2006, and 2007).\nMarsh inherited a strong swimming program that was a fixture in the national swimming scene and regularly in the top 20 but was in a slump and turned it into a dynastic powerhouse. Since Marsh took over the Auburn swimming and diving program, Auburn's men finished in the Top 10 every year but his first two years (1991 &amp; 1992 Auburn teams finished 20th and 15th). In 1990, the year before Marsh came to Auburn, the team failed to qualify any swimmers for the NCAA Division I Championship Meet; in Marsh's first year in 1991, the men's team placed 20th at the championship meet. In 1993 the Tigers finished #6 in the NCAAs and have not fallen out of the top 10 since, with the lowest placing in that time being #7 in 2001. The women have been equally successful, jumping from #30 in Marsh's first year to #8 in his second of 92. The lowest finish for the Tiger women since 1992 was #13 in 1995.\nSwimMAC Carolina (formerly known as Mecklenburg Aquatic Club ).\nMarsh, Head Coach at Auburn University, became CEO &amp; Director of Coaching for SwimMAC Carolina Mecklenburg Aquatic Club in the summer of 2007. Marsh focused his attention on developing an Elite component of the program, for athletes who rise to a world-class level from within the SwimMAC program, as well as those relocating to North Carolina, such as post-graduate and professional swimmers focusing on their Olympic dreams. Marsh stated, “I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to move to Charlotte and join one of the country's premier programs. I have a long history with SwimMAC athletes and have found them to be remarkable individuals. SwimMAC athletes such as Aaron Ciarla, Daniel Slocki, and Catherine Caldwell have been a key part of the championship program we have built at Auburn. I look forward to joining the quality coaching staff at this club and working with the coaches, athletes, and parents to build a championship program in Charlotte.”\nIn 2016 Marsh and Team Elite placed Anthony Ervin, Ryan Lochte, Cammille Adams, Kathleen Baker, Jimmy Feigen, and Katie Meili on the US Olympic Team.\nIn late 2016, the board decided to move forward without Marsh as CEO and agreed to work to redefine his and Team Elite's role at the club. In May 2017, SwimMAC and Marsh announced a mutual parting of ways.\nOlympians.\nMarsh has coached 49 Olympians from 19 countries.\nIndividual champions.\nMarsh's swimmers have combined to win 89 individual NCAA titles and 277 individual SEC titles. Auburn swimmers have also brought home 90 medals from international competitions such as the World Championships, Goodwill Games, Pan-American Games, and the Olympics.\n2016 Olympics.\nOn September 9, 2015, USA Swimming announced that Marsh would serve as the head coach of the women's roster of the 2016 US Olympic Swimming Team. Marsh stated: \"I will do all I can to uphold the unmatched tradition of excellence that has been established by the swimmers and coaches from the previous Olympic Games.\" A total of 8 medals were achieved by the Team Elite Athletes. 1 Gold for Ryan Lochte (4x200 free relay), 2 Gold for Anthony Ervin (4x100 free relay prelims &amp; 50 free); 2 for Katie Meili (Bronze 100 Br &amp; Gold 4x100 medley relay prelims); 1 Gold for Jimmy Feigen (4x100 free relay prelims); 2 for Kathleen Baker (Silver 100 back; Gold 4x100 medley relay)\nIsrael.\nIn December 2016 Marsh was named the ‘Professional Adviser’ of the Israel Swimming Association, with a goal of preparing the country's swimmers for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\nCoaching honors.\nCSCAA Women's Coach of the Year: `01, `02, `03\nCSCAA Men's Coach of the Year: `94, `97, `99, `03, `04\nSEC Men's Coach of the Year: `92, `93, `97, `98, `99, `01, `03, `04, `05\nSEC Women's Coach of the Year: `93, `02, `03\nKnoxville News-Sentinel Men's Coach of the Year: `93, `95, `98, `99, `01, `03, `04\nKnoxville News-Sentinel Women's Coach of the Year: `92, `93, `03\nInside the Auburn Tigers Coach of the Year: `93, `96, `97, `03, `04\n2016 USA Women's Olympic Team Head Coach\n2014 USA Women's Team Assistant Pan Pac Championships, Australia\n2012 USA Men's Olympic Team Assistant\n2010 USA Men's Duel in the Pool Head Coach\n2005 USA World Championships Assistant Men's Assistant Coach\n2003 USA World Championships Head Coach\n2003 &amp; 2005 USA Men's Mutual of Omaha Duel in the Pool Head Coach\n2000 &amp; 2003 National Collegiate and Scholastic Swimming Trophy\n2003 Board Member of the Greater Lee County Boys and Girls Club\n2000 USA Men's Olympic Team Assistant Coach\n1999 USA Men's Pan-Pacific Team Assistant Coach\n1996 USA Men's Olympic Team Assistant Coach\n1995 USA Men's Pan-Pacific Team Head Coach\n1994 USA Women's Assistant Coach-World Championship Team\nHonored on the \"Tiger Trail\" of Auburn which commemorates athletic achievements by coaches and athletes.\n2016 Inducted into the North Carolina Swimming Hall of Fame\n2015 Inducted into the Auburn Swimming Hall of Fame\nMarsh also serves on the boards of the American Swimming Coaches Association as well as the Championship Performance Advisory Board."

        "title": "Jack McKinney (basketball)",
        "text": "John Paul McKinney (July 13, 1935 – September 25, 2018) was an American college and professional basketball coach. As a head coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Los Angeles Lakers, he introduced an up-tempo style of play that became known as Showtime. However, his only season with the Lakers ended prematurely after a bicycle accident. McKinney joined the Indiana Pacers, where he was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1981. He also coached the Kansas City Kings (now known as the Sacramento Kings). In addition, he served as an assistant for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Portland Trail Blazers.\nEarly life.\nJohn Paul McKinney was born on July 13, 1935, in Chester, Pennsylvania, to Paul McKinney, a police detective, and Jen McMahon, a homemaker. He attended St. James High in Chester, where he played basketball under coach Jack Ramsay. He graduated in 1953.\nCollege career.\nMcKinney went to college at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. He played three seasons for the Hawks, who were also coached by Dr. Jack Ramsay, and led the team to the Big 5's inaugural title and the school's first ever postseason in the 1956 National Invitation Tournament (NIT). He was also a member of their track and field team.\nCoaching career.\nSt. James High School (1959–1960).\nMcKinney coached one season at St. James in 1959–60, leading them to a 17–11 record.\nSaint Joseph's High School (1960–1965).\nMcKinney coached five years at his alma mater St. Joseph's as an assistant under Ramsay.\nPhiladelphia Textile (1965–1966).\nMcKinney was the head coach at Philadelphia Textile for one season in 1965–66.\nSaint Joseph's (1966–1974).\nMcKinney returned to St. Joe's in 1966, replacing the departed Ramsay as head coach. McKinney is a member of the Saint Joseph's and the Big 5 Halls of Fame. He was also named the Eastern Coach of the Year by Philadelphia sportswriters for his 1973–74 season when the Hawks, predicted to have a poor year after graduating Mike Bantom to the NBA and Pat McFarland to the American Basketball Association (ABA), had a stellar season again winning their conference and qualifying for postseason play. However, he was fired after a first-round loss in the 1974 NCAA Division I basketball tournament, and his dismissal prompted a demonstration by over 500 students.\nMilwaukee Bucks (1974–1976).\nMcKinney was an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1974 to 1976.\nPortland Trail Blazers (1976–1979).\nMcKinney was an assistant coach with the Portland Trail Blazers, and won an NBA championship with the Trail Blazers under Ramsay in 1976–77. Ramsay called McKinney the architect of the offense and his wife Claire said McKinney considered his tenure with the Blazers the highlight of his career.\nLos Angeles Lakers (1979).\nMcKinney received his first NBA head coaching job in 1979–80 with the Lakers. Owner Jerry Buss, who had recently acquired the team, wanted games to be entertaining, and hired the coach to install a running offense. McKinney had rookie Magic Johnson, who some thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league. \nOn November 8, 1979, the Lakers were 9–4 after 13 games, when McKinney suffered a near fatal head injury after falling while bicycling. Assistant coach Paul Westhead, who also worked under McKinney at St. Joseph's, was named the interim head coach. However, the length of the recovery and lingering doubts about the complete return of McKinney's mental faculties, combined with the team's level of success under Westhead, ultimately meant that McKinney would never get the chance to return to the job. Westhead continued to use McKinney's offense, a creative and spontaneous offense that came to be known as Showtime, and the team finished the season with a record of 60–22. The Lakers advanced to that year's NBA Finals, when McKinney was fired mid-series on May 13, 1980. The Lakers won the series for their first of five NBA titles in nine seasons, and hired Westhead to permanently replace McKinney.\nPat Riley, who replaced Westhead as Lakers coach, won four titles with the team and became the coach most synonymous with the Showtime Lakers. However, Norm Nixon credited McKinney with creating Showtime. \"That should never be forgotten,\" said Nixon. According to Riley, McKinney \"might have won five or six titles for the Lakers in the '80s\" were it not for his accident. McKinney was deferential. \"I just put in some ideas that were accepted, and the rest was up to Paul and Pat and some great players,\" he said.\nIndiana Pacers (1980–1984).\nMcKinney joined the Indiana Pacers the following season in 1980–81. He was hired at the recommendation of a guilt-ridden Buss, who was a business partner with Pacers owner Frank Mariani. In his first season, McKinney was named the NBA Coach of the Year after leading the Pacers to their first playoff appearance since the former American Basketball Association (ABA) team joined the NBA during the ABA–NBA merger of 1976. Over the next three seasons, however, the team's performance regressed, and McKinney was fired after the Pacers posted the league's worst record in the 1983–84 season.\nKansas City Kings (1984).\nMcKinney was soon hired as the head coach of the Kansas City Kings, but resigned from the position on November 18, 1984, after the team started with a 1–8 record in the 1984-85 season. He left coaching for good afterwards, citing ongoing issues with his memory, plus no longer feeling passionate about the profession.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter he left coaching, McKinney relocated back to his native Pennsylvania with his family. He worked as a sales representative for a major sporting goods company, while also filling in at times as a color analyst for the Philadelphia 76ers broadcasts. He said he got offers to come back to coaching, but never took any of them. Eventually, he and his wife would retire to Florida. \nIn 2005, McKinney co-authored a book about his experiences at Saint Joseph's, and donated 10 percent of its proceeds to the school.\nPersonal life.\nMcKinney died on September 25, 2018, at a hospice in Bonita Springs, Florida, at the age of 83.\nMcKinney was portrayed by Tracy Letts in the HBO documentary series \"\"."

He played high school basketball at Lafayette High School (Louisiana) and also had his jersey retired there. Benoit played in the NJCAA for Tyler Junior College, from 1986 to 1988. His last two years of college basketball were spent with the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide.\nHe is also cousins with ex UFC champion Daniel Cormier\nProfessional career.\nUtah Jazz.\nBenoit was not selected in the 1990 NBA draft, playing his first professional season in Spain. In the following year, he joined the Utah Jazz as a free agent, and would post interesting numbers during his five-season spell.\nIn 1993, Benoit participated in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where he finished fourth out of eight contestants. During the 1994–95 season, he achieved a career-best 10 points and five rebounds per game in 71 regular season contests, to which he added 12 and six in the postseason's first round, as the Jazz were downed 2–3 by the eventual champion Houston Rockets.\nNew Jersey/Orlando.\nAfter losing his starting position to Chris Morris, Benoit left the Jazz in the 1996 summer, and signed with the New Jersey Nets. He spent his first season in the sidelines, due to injury.\nIn early 1998, Benoit was traded, alongside Yinka Dare and Kevin Edwards, to the Orlando Magic, for Brian Evans and Rony Seikaly, appearing in 24 games and averaging six points. He left the United States to play with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel, due in part to the 1998 NBA lockout, and remained there for two years.\nJazz return.\nIn 2000, Benoit returned to the team where he began his career. Now only a fringe player, he averaged 3.6 points in 49 games, as the Jazz once again qualified for the playoffs.\nAfter leaving the NBA at the age of 33 (with averages of exactly seven points and four rebounds, in 492 games), Benoit played for the Shanghai Sharks alongside Yao Ming in the Chinese Basketball Association, winning the 2001–02 league championship. He spent four of the last five seasons of his career in the Japan Basketball League.\nHead coaching record.\n "

        "text": "John James Hayes (born 2 November 1973) is a retired Irish rugby union player who played in the Pro12 and Heineken Cup for Munster. He didn't start playing rugby until he was 18; prior to this he played with the local Cappamore GAA hurling club. It was his size (6 ft 4 in, 19 stone) that enabled him to overcome his late start to the sport. He continues to \"follow GAA in Limerick very much and especially hurling\".\nEarly rugby.\nHayes was introduced to the game of rugby union by friends when he joined local rugby club Bruff in County Limerick. He then moved up a grade when he joined Shannon before travelling to Invercargill, New Zealand, where he changed position from lock to prop because he had \"bulked up\". On his return to Ireland, he rejoined Shannon and gained a place on the Munster squad. He later rejoined his original club Bruff when they joined the AIL as a senior club in 2004.\nIn September 2012, he released his autobiography \"The Bull: My Story\", which details his sporting life. On 5 October 2012, he appeared as a guest on the \"Late Late Show\" alongside his wife to talk about his career.\nMunster.\nIn 2006, he helped Munster win the Heineken European Cup in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 21 May against Biarritz. Earlier that year, he had helped Ireland secure the Triple Crown.\nIn 2008, he again helped Munster win the Heineken European Cup in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 24 May against Toulouse.\nHe became the fifth Munster player to win 200 caps in the Magners League semi-final against Ospreys on 14 May 2011. In July 2011, Hayes was left out the 45-man Munster squad for the forthcoming season fuelling speculation that he may retire after the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nDespite the speculation that Hayes would retire, he came off the bench for Munster in their opening Pro12 match against Newport Gwent Dragons in September 2011. Hayes was contracted with Munster until the end of 2011.\nHayes became the first person to play 100 Heineken Cup games in November 2011 when he came on against Northampton Saints in the 2011–12 Heineken Cup.\nIt was announced that Hayes would retire after Munster's Pro12 fixture against Connacht on 26 December 2011. He was selected to start his final match, and was substituted in the 58th minute, going off the pitch to a huge standing ovation from the crowd. Munster won the match 24–9.\nIreland.\nHayes won his first international cap against Scotland in 2000 and was Ireland's first-choice tighthead prop from then until the beginning of the 2010–11 season when he was replaced by Leinster's Mike Ross. He was a member of the British &amp; Irish Lions squad in their tour to New Zealand in 2005 and played in the warm-up test match vs Argentina.\nHayes became Ireland's most capped player during Ireland's first Grand Slam in 61 years in 2009 with 94 appearances.\nHe earned his 100th cap for Ireland against England on 27 February 2010. He was the first Irish player to do so. Hayes led Ireland out onto the pitch before the game to a standing ovation from the Twickenham crowd. Ireland went on to win 20–16 with a late try by Tommy Bowe. Hayes did not play against the Barbarians in Ireland's first match of the summer tests and missed the test against New Zealand through illness. He came on as a replacement against New Zealand Maori but was left out of the squad to play Australia, thereby losing his title of Ireland's most capped player to Brian O'Driscoll.\nHayes was selected in Ireland's training squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup warm-ups in August and came off the bench in Ireland's first warm-up against Scotland. This turned out to be his last appearance for Ireland as he was not selected in the final 30-man squad for the tournament in New Zealand. He retired in December 2011.\n2009 Lions Tour.\nOn 18 June 2009, Hayes was called up to the British &amp; Irish Lions squad in South Africa as a replacement for the injured Euan Murray. He played in the final test of the tour.\nStatistics.\nInternational analysis by opposition.\nCorrect as of 5 July 2017"

Blair is the only person to have played on and then later coached THE SAME TEAM, The Virginia Military Institute, VMI, to the Southern Conference Championship Title and the NCAA tournament. Bill was the captain of the 1964 team that won the Southern Conference Championship and went on to the NCAA tournament, then returned as the coach of VMI in 1973. In 1976, he led VMI again, this time as their coach, to the Southern conference championship and went to the “Elite Eight” in the NCAA tournament. Not only is he the only player / coach to accomplish this with any team, but it is even more impressive that he did it with a military academy. \nBlair worked twenty seasons in the National Basketball Association, beginning in New Jersey with the New Jersey Nets, and continuing to the Chicago Bulls, under Kevin Loughery, helping to draft Michael Jordan. He then moved to the Washington Bullets under Wes Unseld, and next the Indiana Pacers under Larry Brown—coaching spectacular teams with Reggie Miller at the helm. In 1993, he became the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, then returned to the Pacers, and finally finished his career under Randy Whitman at the Cleveland Cavaliers. \nBlair is a 1960 graduate of Randolph-Macon Academy where he starred on the best basketball team the school ever had. He made the starting five as a sophomore and was the high scorer his senior year in a season when they lost only one game which he and three other starters missed. When next they played the same school they doubled their opponent's point total. He scored 49 points in one game which is the school record. He played college ball at VMI where he led them to their first NCAA appearance in 32 years as their high scorer. In 1964 Blair was drafted by the St. Louis Hawks in the 4th round, but had to complete his military service of two years. While in the Army serving in Korea, he played AND coached the 8th Army Division team which won the Korean championship and the Asian-Pacific Championship in Okinawa. He toured with the Army All Star team and won the Armed Forces Inter-service championships in 1966.\nAfter two stints at Virginia high schools, he returned to VMI as an assistant, then a head coach. Blair led the Keydets to an NCAA tournament berth and an Elite 8 appearance. After a five-year stint with the Colorado Buffaloes, he moved on to the NBA. He is now retired and enjoying life with his family. Coach Bill Blair is the only college coach to both play in and coach the same team to the Southern Conference Championship and the NCAA tournament. He played (and Captained) VMI in 1964 and let them to the Southern Conference Championship and into the NCAA tournament, then returned as the head coach and in 1976 led them to the Southern Conference Championship and to the \"Elite Eight\" in the NCAA Tournament."

An all-state player as a high school player in Illinois, Rodgers went on to play for Iowa, where he was a three-year starter on the Hawkeyes basketball team. Originally planning to go into dentistry, Rodgers, who was a pre-dental major, decided to go into coaching. After graduation, he was hired as an assistant by Bill Fitch, then the head coach for the University of North Dakota basketball team, whose team featured All-America center Phil Jackson.\nRodgers followed Fitch to the National Basketball Association (NBA) when Fitch was hired as the head coach of the expansion Cleveland Cavaliers in 1970; he would remain with the team for the duration of Fitch's tenure before following him to the Boston Celtics when Fitch became their head coach for the 1979–80 season. Rodgers remained with the team as an assistant under K. C. Jones, who replaced Fitch following the 1982–83 season, also becoming the team's director of player personnel. While hoping to land the New York Knicks head coaching job in 1987, which went to Rick Pitino, Rodgers was promoted to head coach of the Celtics after Jones decided to retire from coaching after the 1987–88 season.\nHe coached the Celtics for two seasons, with the team going 42–40 in 1988–89 (and a playoff berth and quick first-round exit), due to a season where its star player, Larry Bird, missed all but six games due to injury. After the team rebounded to a 52–30 record the following season, Rodgers was fired after a first-round playoff loss to the Knicks in five games.\nHe was hired by the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves in 1991, where for nearly a season and a half, with a young team devoid of talent, the Wolves struggled to a combined record of 21–90, before he was fired following the 1992–93 season. He served as an assistant on staffs that won six NBA championships (1981, 1984, and 1986 with the Celtics, and 1996, 1997, and 1998 with the Chicago Bulls, where he reunited with Phil Jackson, who was the team's head coach). During his days as an assistant with the Celtics, he helped coach Celtic players Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Dennis Johnson (plus Nate Archibald in 1981 and Bill Walton in 1986). As an assistant for Chicago, he helped Jackson coach championship-winning teams that featured Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman."

They are overseen by Baseball Canada, the governing body of baseball in Canada. \nCanada was an inaugural member of the World Baseball Classic, making its debut in the first edition. They have yet to make it past the first round.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nThe roster for the 2023 World Baseball Classic\nCompetitive record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2006 WBC: Inaugural classic.\nIn June 2005, Major League Baseball announced the formation of the World Baseball Classic (WBC), an international competition to be held in March 2006 for the first time. Canada was one of the sixteen teams invited to play in the inaugural classic. Because the event will be held in March, before the North American baseball season traditionally starts, players active in Major League Baseball or any minor league affiliates are eligible to play in the WBC, making the team markedly different from the teams which represented Canada in the 2005 World Cup or the 2004 Olympics.\nSeveral high-profile Canadian players declined the opportunity to participate, including Ryan Dempster, Shawn Hill, Danny Klassen, Éric Gagné and Rich Harden, who were injured. Los Angeles Dodgers' prospect Russell Martin was named to the team, but pulled out in favor of reporting to Spring training. In addition, Larry Walker, who retired after the 2005 season, opted not to participate, choosing instead to serve in a coaching capacity.\nCanada played in Pool B of the tournament with Mexico, South Africa and the United States.\nTeam Canada was heavily favoured to win their first game against South Africa, a team made up almost entirely by amateurs. However, South Africa put up a tough challenge to the Canadian team. South African starter, Carl Michaels pitched outstandingly; Canada could not get a run until the 5th inning, when they scored 3. However, the South Africans shockingly scored 4 runs of their own in the bottom of the 5th against Paul Quantrill. It was back and forth from then on. It looked like South Africa might pull off a monumental upset as they went into the 9th with an 8–7 lead. However, in the top of the 9th, the Canadians scored 4 times to win the game 11–8.\nAfter almost being upset by a surprising South African team, Canada pulled off an upset of its own with an 8-6 victory over the star-studded United States team. Scoring in each of the first five innings, the Canadians built an 8–0 lead using a combination of timely, patient hitting, steady pitching and clutch fielding. In the bottom of the fifth, the United States threatened a comeback, exploding for 6 runs, capped off by a Jason Varitek grand slam. The Canadian team held off the US the rest of the way, as neither team crossed the plate again in the game. Adam Stern had a strong outing, going 3 for 4, a double shy of the cycle, with an inside-the-park home run, as well as making several spectacular plays in center field to keep his team ahead.\nAfter Canada's victory over the United States, they got shocked by the Mexican team in a 9–1 resounding defeat. Unfortunately for the Canadian side, this victory would eventually cost them the trip to the 2nd round of the tournament after the United States beat South Africa 17–0 and clinched the second place in Pool B. Canada, USA, and Mexico each finished with a 2–1 record in the pool, but Canada lost the tie-breaker based on runs allowed.\n2009 WBC: First classic held on home soil.\nCanada was placed in 2009 World Baseball Classic – Pool C hosting the United States, Italy, and Venezuela at Rogers Centre in Toronto. In their opener, Canada lost a close game against the United States by a score of 6–5. On March 9, Canada was eliminated from the tournament after losing 6–2 to underdog Italy. Canada exited the WBC with an 0–2 record and 6.35 runs allowed per 9 innings, to secure thirteenth place overall. \n2013 WBC: Brawl vs Mexico.\nCanada qualified by winning a qualifying tournament in Armin-Wolf-Arena in Regensburg, Germany, in September 2012, that also featured the Czech Republic, Germany and Great Britain. Canada moved on to the 1st Round.\nThe Canadian team was placed in 2013 World Baseball Classic – Pool D against Italy, Mexico and the United States. In their opener, Canada lost to the Italian baseball team 14–4 after the game ended in the 8th inning due to the mercy rule in place after Italy scored five additional runs during the bottom of the 8th inning. On March 9, Canada faced off against Mexico. With Canada already leading the game, third baseman Luis Cruz motioned the pitcher Arnold Leon to bean the next batter, Rene Tosoni, which resulted in a bench clearing brawl. Seven players from both teams ejected from the game. Despite this, they clinched a 10–3 win over Mexico. They lost the final game against the United States 9–4, thus eliminating Canada from the tournament. \nThe Canadian team missed out on advancing to the next round for the third time, but still managed to claim their automatic qualification for the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n2017 WBC: Worst finish.\nCanada was placed in 2017 World Baseball Classic – Pool C against the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and the United States. Their performances were abysmal, even losing to surprising debutants Colombia. \nAfter losing all three of its matches, they finished last in their group, and were forced to go through qualifiers for the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n2023 WBC.\nCanada automatically qualified for the 2023 tournament by playing in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\nThe Canadian team was placed in 2023 World Baseball Classic – Pool C against Great Britain, United States, Columbia and Mexico. They began pool play against Great Britain. The Canadians had to overcome an early deficit, however, Tyler O’Neill and Jacob Robson had four hits each to lead Canada to an 18–8 mercy rule win   In Game 2, propelled by a nine-run first inning, they lost 1–12 against the United States. In Game 3 against Columbia, Canada led 1–0 going into the eighth inning, but Otto Lopez, a Toronto Blue Jays prospect, led off the inning with a triple and was driven in by Owen Caissie's two-out RBI single to push the lead to 2–0. Lopez's three-run shot in the ninth gave Canada an even bigger cushion, which ultimately lead them to winning 5–0. Their 2–1 record set up a win-or-go-home game vs Mexico. After a good start to the game, Mexico blew the game open with a four-run sixth, keyed by Randy Arozarena’s three-run double. They would go on to win the game 10–3, ultimately eliminating Canada from the tournament.\nBy finishing top four in their group, Canada still managed to claim their automatic qualification spot for the 2026 World Baseball Classic.\nOlympic Games.\nCanada has qualified for two Olympic Games, in 2004 and 2008. Canadian teams also competed twice when baseball was a demonstration sport, in 1984 and 1988.\n1984 Summer Olympics: Inaugural tournament.\nCanada was invited to participate at the 1984 Summer Olympics. They finished with a 1–2 record in pool play, and did not advance to the knockout round. They finished tied for third in their pool, the equivalent of a tie for fifth overall.\n1988 Summer Olympics: Missing the knockout stage.\nCanada qualified for the 1988 Summer Olympics by finishing in fourth place at the 1987 Pan American Games and defeating 1987 European Baseball Championship silver medalist Italy in a playoff. They finished with a 1–2 record in pool play, and did not advance to the knockout round. They finished in seventh place overall.\n2004 Summer Olympics: Fourth place finish.\nCanada qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics by finishing second at the Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Panama. They finished with a 5–2 record in pool play, then fell to Cuba in the semifinals. Canada would ultimately lose the Bronze Medal game 11–2 to Japan.\n2008 Summer Olympics: Missing the knockout round.\nCanada qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics by finishing first in the Final Qualifying Tournament. They finished with 2–5 record in pool play, and did not advance to the knockout round.\nWBSC Premier12.\n2015 WBSC Premier12: Inaugural event.\nCanada was placed in Pool A against Cuba, Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Italy, and host Chinese Taipei. They completed a perfect 5–0 pool play to advance to the playoff stage. They ultimately lost to Mexico 4–3 in the quarter-finals, finishing in fifth place overall.\n2019 WBSC Premier12: Stiffer competition.\nTwo quota spots were allocated from the Tournament, of the spots for six baseball teams at the 2020 Olympic Games. \nCanada was placed in Pool C against Australia, Cuba, and host South Korea. They compiled a 1–2 pool play record, and did not advance to the Super Round. They finished in seventh place overall\nAmateur World Series and Baseball World Cup.\nCanada has competed at 9 World Cups and 8 more times in its predecessor the Amateur World series. Their best finish was a bronze at the 2009 World Cup and at the 2011 World Cup.\nPan American Games.\nCanada's first appearance at the Pan American Games came in 1967. Their first medal came in 1999, when the team won the bronze medal for their third-place finish. In 2011, Canada won the gold medal game over the United States, 2–1, to win Canada's first-ever baseball gold medal. Canada won their second consecutive gold medal in 2015, defeating the United States, 7–6 (10 innings), in the final. In 2019, Canada won the silver medal, losing to Puerto Rico in the final match."

The strike occurred from April 1 to 13, 1972.\nBaseball resumed when the owners and players agreed on a $500,000 increase in pension fund payments. Owners agreed to add salary arbitration to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The 86 total games that were missed over the 13-day period were not rescheduled, because the league refused to pay the players for the time they were on strike. As a result, the Houston Astros and San Diego Padres each played only 153 games, nine fewer than normal, and no team played more than 156 games.\nOne major effect of the uneven schedule was that the Detroit Tigers played one more game than the Boston Red Sox, which enabled Detroit (with a record of 86–70) to win the American League East as Boston (with a record of 85–70) finished game behind. Detroit won the division on the next-to-last day of the season when they beat Boston, 3–1, at Tiger Stadium."

        "text": "James John Foster (September 13, 1905 – January 4, 1969) was a Scottish-Canadian ice hockey goaltender. He is best known for his role in leading the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team to its only gold medal, in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics. He was posthumously inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2023.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Glasgow, Foster emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1912. Foster first rose to prominence as a hockey player in the Winnipeg Junior Hockey League in the early 1920s. With the Winnipeg Argonauts, and later the University of Manitoba, Foster earned a reputation as \"the world's finest goaltender.\" His team won the Manitoba Junior Provincial Championship in 1925, and he was a two-time winner of the Manitoba Championship, first in 1927 with the Winnipeg Winnipegs and in 1930 with the Elmwood Millionaires. Around this time, he suffered a broken leg and had to briefly leave hockey. In 1931, he joined the Moncton Hawks of the Maritime Senior Hockey League, a team which he led to the Allan Cup finals in 1932. Foster went an astounding 417 minutes without allowing a goal. He also led the Hawks to victories in the Allan Cup in 1933 and 1934, and during his three seasons with the team, he missed only one game.\nCareer.\nReturn to Britain.\nIn 1935, along with the coach of the Moncton Hawks and Foster's longtime mentor, Percy Nicklin, Foster moved to London to play for the Richmond Hawks. He was selected to the All-Star team, and his new Hawks finished in a tie for first in the league. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association suspended Foster and teammate Alexander Archer for \"leaving the dominion without permission\" to play in England. The International Ice Hockey Federation upheld the decision and the pair were only cleared to play in the Olympics when the Canadians waived the suspensions for the duration of the games.\n1936 Olympic Games.\nIn ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics, Foster represented Great Britain in ice hockey. Foster, along with eight other British born players who had learned their hockey in Canada, a Canadian born British resident and two British natives, helped to lead Great Britain to its first and only Olympic gold medal in ice hockey, narrowly beating out Canada. In seven games, Foster allowed only three goals, recording four shutouts. Foster was allowed to play in the Olympics when Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president E. A. Gilroy chose not enforce a suspension on the eve of the Olympics as a gesture of sportsmanship towards Great Britain.\nLater career.\nIn the years following the 1936 Olympics, Foster continued to represent Great Britain in international competition, leading the nation to back-to-back European Championships in 1937 and 1938. After playing a season with the Harringay Greyhounds, Foster returned to Canada in 1940 to work in an aircraft factory. He later played for the Glace Bay Miners and the Quebec Aces. He was inducted into the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950. As he once thought of entering the Church, he was nicknamed \"The Parson\"."

This also leads to the gates being further apart in giant slalom. The men's giant slalom took place on 20 February.\nStephan Eberharter won the 2002 giant slalom gold, but he had since retired .

Safin saved a match point en route to the title, against Roger Federer in the semifinals. Hewitt was the first Australian to reach the final since Pat Cash in 1988.\nFederer was the defending champion, but lost in the semifinals to Safin in a rematch of the previous year's final, despite holding a match point in the fourth set. Federer's loss ended his 26-match winning streak dating to the 2004 US Open.\nThe final attracted many viewers in Australia (primarily due to the presence of countryman Hewitt), averaging 4.05 million viewers. The viewing audience remains one of the highest in Australian history. The match was broadcast in the host nation by host broadcaster the Seven Network with commentators Bruce McAvaney and two-time champion Jim Courier (in his first appearance on Australian commercial television).\nThis marked the first major main draw appearance of future ten-time Australian Open champion and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic (who qualified and then lost to Safin in the first round), and the last Australian Open for four-time champion Andre Agassi. Future 22-time major champion Rafael Nadal advanced beyond the third round of a major for the first time, losing to Hewitt in the fourth round. It was also the last major in which neither Federer, Nadal, nor Djokovic reached the final until the 2014 US Open, a span of 38 events. It remains the only major where Federer, Nadal and Djokovic all competed but none of them reached the final."

        "text": "Kenya sent a delegation to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, from 10–26 February 2006. This was Kenya's third time participating in a Winter Olympic Games. The Kenyan delegation consisted of one athlete, cross-country skier and three-time Olympian Philip Boit. In his only event, he finished 91st in the men's 15 kilometre classical.\nBackground.\nThe National Olympic Committee of Kenya was recognised by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1955. They have competed at most Summer Olympic Games since then and through 2016 have won exactly 100 medals at Summer Olympiads. Their first Winter Olympics participation, however, only came in the 1998 Winter Olympics, and Kenya was making its third Winter Olympic appearance in Turin. Kenya has never won a Winter Olympics medal. The Kenyan delegation was the first to check in at the Turin Olympics. The 2006 Winter Olympics were held from 10–26 February; a total of 2,508 athletes representing 80 National Olympic Committees took part. The delegation consisted of a single athlete, cross-country skier Philip Boit. He was the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. Boit was Kenya's only Winter Olympian until Sabrina Simader competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics, a games at which he served as chef de mission.\nCross-country skiing.\nPhilip Boit, who had gained international recognition after placing last in the 1998 Winter Olympics, competed in his third Olympics as Kenya's sole representative. Boit was a runner in his native Kenya, who had been scouted by American sportswear company Nike, who wished to train runners as cross-country skiers. In 1998, Boit finished the 10 kilometer classical race in a time of 47 minutes and 25.5 seconds, 20 minutes behind Bjørn Dæhlie, the gold medalist; delaying the medal ceremony, Dæhlie remained at the finish line to congratulate Boit. Boit saw snow only two years before his Olympic debut in 1998, and later named his first child after Dæhlie. He was 26 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics. On 17 February, Boit finished the 15 kilometre classical in a time of 53 minutes and 32.4 seconds, which put him in 91st place out of 96 classified finishers. The gold medal was won by Andrus Veerpalu of Estonia in 38 minutes and 1.3 seconds, the silver by Lukáš Bauer of the Czech Republic and bronze was taken by Tobias Angerer of Germany. When Kenya next qualified for a Winter Olympics, in 2018, Boit was one of the coaches and said of the athlete Sabrina Simader, \"Being the pioneer of skiing in Kenya, I am glad that my legacy continues as Simader heads to South Korea.\""

        "title": "Mike McCormack (American football)",
        "text": "Michael Joseph McCormack Jr. (June 21, 1930 – November 15, 2013) was an American professional football player, coach, and executive in the National Football League (NFL). He played as an offensive tackle with the Cleveland Browns from 1954 through 1962 and served as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, Baltimore Colts, and Seattle Seahawks. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1984.\nPlaying career.\nMcCormack played college football at University of Kansas and assumed that he would take up a career as a high school coach. He was selected by the New York Yanks in the 1951 NFL draft, but had to wait until the third round before being taken. After the 1951 season concluded, he was conscripted into the U.S. Army and served in the Korean War. While he was away, the Yanks moved to Dallas and became the Texans, which folded after just one season.\nMcCormack came home in 1954 to find that his team had ceased to exist, so he became a free agent and was immediately signed by the Baltimore Colts, a new franchise created the previous year to replace the defunct Yanks/Texans. Cleveland Browns founder Paul Brown had not forgotten seeing McCormack play in his rookie season three years earlier and was sufficiently impressed that he decided to add him to the roster in a trade exchange with Baltimore. In his first season with the team in 1954, he played on the defensive line, and famously grabbed the ball out of Lions QB Bobby Layne's hands (in what the referees ruled as a fumble recovery) in the 1954 NFL Championship game against the Detroit Lions, helping set up an important early touchdown.\nThe following season, he was shifted to offensive tackle and helped the Browns once again capture the NFL title. He played a key role in helping legendary running back Jim Brown become one of the dominant players in the game, ending his career with six selections to the Pro Bowl.\nPaul Brown, legendary Cleveland Browns founder, owner, and coach, stated in his 1979 memoir, \"PB: The Paul Brown Story\", \"I consider (Mike) McCormack the finest offensive tackle who ever played pro football.\" Also, according to Paul Zimmerman's 1984 book, \"The New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football\", Brown also stated that McCormack was the best offensive lineman he ever coached. The book states that McCormack \"[c]ould handle the Colts' Gino Marchetti better than any tackle in the game. Power combined with great intelligence and 4.8 speed. 'I've seen him have games,' former player and NFL executive Bucko Kilroy says, 'where if you were grading him, he'd score 100. Not one mistake, and his guy would never make a tackle.'\"\nCoaching career.\nMcCormack retired from playing in 1962 and began coaching with the first of four consecutive stints as an assistant in the annual College All-Star Game. In 1965, he was hired as an assistant coach with the Washington Redskins, spending the next eight seasons working under four different head coaches, including former teammate Otto Graham from 1966–1968.\nMcCormack was hired to replace Ed Khayat as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles on January 17, 1973. He inherited a team that ended 1972 in the NFC East cellar at 2–11–1 and hadn't had a winning campaign since 1966. Three seasons and a 16–25–1 record later, he was dismissed on December 22, 1975, following a 4–10 last-place finish.\nAfter four years as offensive line coach with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1976 through 1979, he was selected over Frank Kush and George Welsh to succeed Ted Marchibroda as head coach of the Baltimore Colts on January 17, 1980. The ballclub finished in last place at 5–11 in each of the two seasons prior to McCormack's arrival. When the Colts fell from 7–9 in 1980 to 2–14 the following year, he was fired on December 21, 1981, and replaced by Kush the next day. As McCormack put it, \"I wanted to be like my mentor, Paul Brown. He was a great teacher and I tried to do the same but unfortunately I always let my emotions carry me away.\"\nAdministrative career.\nIn 1982, McCormack joined the Seattle Seahawks, eventually becoming president and general manager. That year, the Seahawks lost their first two games, then a 57-day players strike ensued. During the hiatus, seventh-year head coach Jack Patera was fired in mid-October and McCormack took over as interim head coach. He led them to a 4–3 record, the only time he compiled a winning record as an NFL head coach, but Seattle did not qualify for the 16-team postseason. McCormack then returned to his management position when the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as their new head coach in 1983 and declined all further offers to become a head coach.\nIn late January 1989, he was abruptly fired by the new Seahawks owner, Ken Behring, who explained the decision was necessary in order to make changes in the financial operations of the team. Later that year, McCormack became a consultant for Jerry Richardson and his ownership group that were seeking to land an NFL expansion team in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1993, he was hired by the newly-formed Carolina Panthers as their team president and general manager, and their inaugural season was in 1995. He retired from the Panthers organization in 1997, which erected a monument in their stadium honoring him.\nDeath.\nAt the age of 83 in 2013, McCormack died of heart failure in Palm Desert, California."

        "title": "Halfback (American football)",
        "text": "A halfback (HB) is an offensive position in American football, whose duties involve lining up in the offensive backfield and carrying the ball on most rushing plays, i.e. a running back. When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield, and especially when that player is placed behind another player (usually a blocking back), as in the I formation, that player is instead referred to as a tailback (TB).\nSometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as they are an eligible receiver. Occasionally, they line up as additional wide receivers. When not running or catching the ball, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nBefore the emergence of the T formation in the 1940s, all members of the offensive backfield were legitimate threats to run or pass the ball. Most teams used four offensive backs on every play: a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback. The quarterback began each play a quarter of the way back, the halfbacks began each play side by side and halfway back, and the fullback began each play the farthest back.\nHistorically, from the 1870s through the 1950s, the halfback position was both an offensive and defensive position. Now that most offensive formations have only one or two running backs, the original designations do not mean as much, as the fullback is now usually a lead blocker (technically a halfback), while the halfback or tailback (called such because he stands at the \"tail\" of the I) lines up behind the fullback. There has also been a shift in most offense's dependence on halfbacks, as the quarterback is now generally considered the most essential part of a team. However, the average output of the halfback has not changed.\nIn the related sport of Canadian football, halfback is usually a defensive, rather than offensive, position since the 1980s. It is also used to refer to an offensive position similar to a slotback that could line up off the tight end or behind the quarterback. Older systems require the halfback be proficient at throwing the ball downfield as well.\nMany of the \"scat backs\" in the modern era produce more total yards and touchdowns than their ancestor \"power backs\" by breaking off big plays on outside runs and receptions. The spread offense and the hurry-up offense change the halfback's role but create more opportunity for these plays. The spread, the hurry-up, and the pro-style offenses dominate American football but the \"smash-mouth\" style of play is far from extinct. A power-running scheme is often utilized to counter an effective Spread attack, as it allows a team to control the clock and keep the ball out of the opposing offense's control. This strategy is utilized in NFL, college, and all other forms of American football. The need for \"power backs\" is very prevalent, alongside the need for \"scat backs\", and anything in between.\nIn the past few decades the role of the halfback has gone through a great shift as most offensive game plans are now fueled by creativity and finesse instead of raw force. Stamina and durability is more important than ever in the hurry-up offense. On the other hand, speed is often valued over strength, and pass-catching ability is sometimes valued over blocking proficiency. Power was once the most desired trait in a halfback, but has been over taken by the need for a diverse skill set.\nIn the last few decades the running back's individual share of offensive output has declined as quarterbacks are generally treated as the cornerstone of the offense. The demands of an up-tempo offense also favor a multiple running back system.\nWhile the timeline differs for individual players, running backs generally hit their peak between the ages of 22 and 28. A fantasy league study concluded in 2021 that about 84 percent of peak seasons fall within that range.\nSmash mouth football.\nFrom the dawn of American football through the 1880s most offensive schemes focused on the running game. In a running based game plan the halfback was typically the cornerstone of the offense. This system focused on a physical run attack concentrated in the inside of the field, and therefore depended on a skilled \"power back.\" There were no forward passes, and pure speed took a backseat to tackle-breaking and bucking ability. There was a focus on physicality over finesse, with this type of playing style earning the modern-day moniker \"smash mouth\" football.\nBack Willie Heston of Fielding Yost's \"point-a-minute\" Michigan team has been acknowledged as the first to play at what later was designated as the tailback position on offense. Before Heston, left halfbacks ran plays in one direction, and right halfbacks ran plays in the other direction. Because of Heston's speed and agility, Yost placed Heston in the tailback position so that he could carry the ball on plays to either side of the line.\nHeston's charging ability and open-field running have also been credited with leading to the origin of the \"seven man line and a diamond on defense.\" Minnesota's College Football Hall of Fame coaching staff of Henry L. Williams and Pudge Heffelfinger devised the strategy in 1903 to stop Heston. Minnesota had previously used the then-traditional nine-man line with the fullback backing up the line and a safety man down the field. Heffelfinger suggested that the halfbacks be pulled out of the line and stationed behind the tackles, thus requiring Heston to break through an initial seven-man line and a secondary line consisting of the fullback and two halfbacks. Known as the \"Minnesota shift\", the formation became a standard practice. In 1936, Arch Ward credited Heston with leading to one of the \"noteworthy transitions\" in football history.\nThe sport's first triple threat, Bradbury Robinson of St. Louis University, ran, passed, received and punted out of the halfback position. It was as a halfback that Robinson threw the first legal forward pass to teammate Jack Schneider in a game at Carroll College on September 5, 1906. Halfback Jim Thorpe rushed for some 2,000 yards in 1912 as a member of the Carlisle Indians. In 1928, Ken Strong accounted for some 3,000 yards. Don Hutson, one of the sport's first great receivers, had his passes in college tossed by halfback Dixie Howell.\nCharacteristics of a halfback.\nRunning.\nThe halfback needs good blocking from the offensive line and fullback to successfully gain yardage. Also, a halfback will generally have more rushing attempts than a receiver will have receptions. This is mainly because most teams have one primary halfback to receive most of the carries, while a passing game will be spread over a number of wide receivers, slot receivers, tight ends, and running backs. The ability to protect the football on the run is an important skill required of a running back. For an offense to succeed the ball has to be protected, and defensive attempts at stripping the ball will largely occur during runs on the inside of the playing field.\nHalfbacks are expected to have good on-field \"vision\", allowing them to identify open rushing lanes and avoid tackles. Hall-of-Famer Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys and Le'Veon Bell of the Kansas City Chiefs, for example, are renowned for their patient running styles and ability to quickly identify lanes created by blockers, despite not being known for their speed.\nReceiving.\nIn addition to skill at running the ball, some halfbacks in the National Football League are known for their skill at catching passes. In the 1970s, Minnesota Vikings running back Chuck Foreman was one of the first halfbacks to establish himself as an elite threat in the receiving game. Foreman caught over 50 passes in four out of five seasons from 1974 to 1978, including a league leading 73 receptions in 1975. The role of the halfback as a receiver out of the backfield has expanded greatly in the NFL over the years, and a versatile halfback who provides his team with running and pass-catching abilities is highly valued. On passing plays, a halfback will often run a safe checkdown route, such as a hook or curl route, creating a safe target for a quarterback to throw to if all other receivers are covered. The increase in demand for halfbacks with good receiving abilities can be attributed to the rise in popularity of the West Coast offense and its variants, which often requires its halfbacks to catch passes on a regular basis. A great early example of a system that combined accomplished rushing skills with receiving ability is the offense of the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s and 1990s under Bill Walsh and George Seifert. Their teams featured two Pro Bowl running backs who also had excellent receiving skills in Roger Craig and Ricky Watters. Craig became the first player in NFL history to both rush and receive more than 1,000 yards in a season. Currently Marshall Faulk is one of the top 20 pass catchers in NFL history. A good example of a dual threat running and pass-catching halfback is LaDainian Tomlinson; in 2003, while with the San Diego Chargers, Tomlinson rushed for 1,645 yards and caught 100 passes for 725 yards, giving him 2,370 total yards from the line of scrimmage, and he became the first NFL player ever to rush for over 1,000 yards and catch 100 passes in a season.\nSome teams have a halfback who is more skilled at catching short passes than the starting halfback on the team, and/or is better at pass blocking or \"picking up the blitz\" than that of the other backs. Known as a \"third down\" back, he is often put in the game in third down and long situations where a pass is needed to pick up a first down. He can also be used to fool the defense by making them think he is being put into the game for a pass play, when the play is actually a run. Darren Sproles was one of the most prominent examples of a \"third down\" back. While never considered a workhorse back partly due to his diminutive 5'6\" stature, Sproles was effective due to his elusiveness and ability to catch and block, enjoying a 14-year career with over 4,800 career receiving yards as a result. Recent examples of these third down backs include Nyheim Hines of the Buffalo Bills, Eno Benjamin of the Arizona Cardinals, J.D. McKissic of the Washington Commanders and Jerick McKinnon of the Kansas City Chiefs.\nBlocking.\nHalfbacks are also required to help the offensive line in passing situations, and, in the case of the fullback, running plays. Halfbacks will often block blitzing linebackers or safeties on passing plays when the offensive line is occupied with the defensive linemen. On running plays, the fullback will often attempt to create a hole in the defensive line for the halfback to run through. Effective blocking backs are usually key components for a running back's success (as seen in LaDainian Tomlinson record-breaking season in 2006).\nPhysical characteristics.\nThere is a great diversity in those who play at the running back position. At one extreme are smaller, faster players. These fast, agile, and elusive running backs are often called \"scat backs\" because their low center of gravity and maneuverability allow them to dodge tacklers. Hall-of-famer Barry Sanders, Chris Johnson, and LeSean McCoy exemplified this running style. \"Scat backs\" still active in the NFL include Saquon Barkley of the Philadelphia Eagles, D'Andre Swift of the Chicago Bears, Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers and Alvin Kamara of the New Orleans Saints. This type of running back has grown in demand due to changes in offensive play calling, style, and tempo. The trending spread offense demands a player that can utilize open space as much as possible as run blockers are sacrificed to spread out the defense.\nAt the other extreme are \"power backs\": bigger, stronger players who can break through tackles using brute strength and raw power. They are usually (but not always) slower runners compared to other backs, and typically run straight ahead (or \"North-and-South\" in football terminology) rather than dodging to the outside edges of the playing field (i.e. running \"East-and-West\") like shorter, quicker, lighter backs will often do. Power backs from previous generations such as Jim Brown and Larry Csonka were often classified as fullbacks, but halfbacks such as Jerome Bettis and Steven Jackson also exemplify the power back position. More recent examples include Marshawn Lynch, Frank Gore, Leonard Fournette, Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns and Derrick Henry of the Baltimore Ravens. For many years the “power” running back was the central component of an offense. In that time period formations and rhythm favored this type of player. This sort of offensive scheme is now a rarity, as “power backs” take on supporting roles behind faster and more versatile running backs.\nIn the modern age, an “every-down” halfback has to have a combination of running ability, pass-catching ability, and blocking ability. The \"every-down\" designation comes from a running back's ability to perform important functions beyond rushing on the ever-increasing number of passing plays such as receiving the ball and pass-blocking for their quarterback. A primary running back also needs abundant stamina to remain consistent in an up-tempo offense. Backs such as Walter Payton and Emmitt Smith were appraised for their versatile running styles and abilities. More recent examples include Dalvin Cook of the Minnesota Vikings, Jonathan Taylor of the Indianapolis Colts and Melvin Gordon of the Denver Broncos.\nGoal line backs.\nMany teams also have a halfback designated as a \"goal line back\" or \"short yardage specialist\". This halfback comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only one to five yards to get a first down. They also come into the game when the offense nears the goal-line. Normally when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line they send in their goal-line formation which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a halfback, and a fullback. The closer they are to the goal-line the more likely they are to use this formation. If a certain halfback is used often near the goal-line he is called the goal-line back. Short yardage and goal-line backs are usually larger power backs that are not prone to fumbling. Their job is to get the first down or touchdown by muscling through or pushing a large mass of players that are being blocked without dropping the ball.\nSpecial teams.\nA halfback might be called upon to return punts and kickoffs on special teams. Although this is most often done by wide receivers and defensive backs, such as cornerbacks (because they are generally the fastest players on the team), some halfbacks have enough speed and talent to perform this role. The NFL's current all-time leading in kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and punt return yards (4,999) by a halfback is Brian Mitchell. He also gained 1,967 rushing yards, 2,336 receiving yards, and 15 fumble return yards, giving him a total of 23,330 all-purpose yards, the second most in NFL history behind Jerry Rice. A halfback, typically a back-up, can also play upback, which is a blocking back who lines up approximately 1–3 yards behind the line of scrimmage in punting situations and usually receive snaps on a fake punt.\nPassing.\nOn rare occasions, and more often in the early days of the sport, a halfback is asked to throw the ball when executing a halfback option. This play is generally referred to as a halfback pass, regardless if the player throwing the football is a tailback or fullback. This play is risky because most halfbacks are inexperienced passers, and so it is often run only by certain halfbacks more skilled at passing than most. The halfback can also throw the ball while running a direct snap play where the center snaps the ball to halfback directly. This has become particular in teams that use the Wildcat formation, most prominently the Miami Dolphins, where running back Ronnie Brown would run, pass, and receive out of this set."

The team is controlled by the Bulgarian Ice Hockey Federation and a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). As of 2018, Bulgaria is ranked 38th in the IIHF World Ranking and competes in Division III of the Ice Hockey World Championships.\nThe team has participated once at the Olympic Winter Games. This happened in Innsbruck in 1976, when Bulgaria fell to the Czechoslovak team 14–1 in the first round. After a few more losses the team finished last in the tournament.\nSofia, the capital of Bulgaria, hosted the games of Division II, Group B of the 2009 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships. Bulgaria's opponents at the tournament were Belgium, Mexico, Spain, South Africa and South Korea. In 2011, Bulgaria was also in Division II, with Croatia, Romania, China, Ireland and Iceland.\nHistorically, the team has played in the second highest level four times, with their highest placement being 14th in 1970. However, the only year that they ever earned promotion (by placing 1st or 2nd in Pool C) was in 1975, which also qualified them for the 1976 Olympics. The only year that they won any games in Pool B was 1992 (at that time it was contested between nations ranked 13th to 20th), defeating Japan, China and Yugoslavia.\nGoaltender Konstantin Mihailov played in 28 Ice Hockey World Championships with Bulgaria, and was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2019, as a recipient of the Torriani Award to recognize his international hockey career."

The Auckland side has won the Plunket Shield 28 times, including a four-year winning streak between 1936 and 1940. The large population base that Auckland have to pick from has contributed to the side's success and produced a large number of the national team's players. Since the introduction of List A cricket in the 1970s, Auckland have won twelve one-day competitions with the most recent in the 2021/22 season.\nEarly years.\nAuckland were the first New Zealand team to visit another province, travelling to Wellington to play Wellington in a one-day match in March 1860, which Auckland won.\nThe Auckland Cricket Association was founded in 1873. Auckland played their first first-class game against Canterbury the same year. They were the third major association founded in New Zealand after Canterbury and Otago, and just before Wellington. The match against Canterbury was part of the first tour undertaken by a New Zealand provincial team, when over three weeks in November and December 1873 Auckland played in Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington and Nelson, winning all four matches.\nIt was not until 1906-07 that the team first competed in structured competition after the donation of the Plunket Shield by the then Governor-General, William Plunket. In the first season of the challenge competition, in 1907–08, Auckland defeated Canterbury to win their first title. They held the Plunket Shield several times between 1908 and 1921, when the competition was changed to a round-robin format.\n'Golden years'.\nThe 1920s and 1930s are often known as the golden years of Auckland cricket. The side won seven Plunket Shield titles, four of them in consecutive years. As well as local success in the 1920s Auckland produced some of the early greats of New Zealand cricket such as Jack Mills and Ces Dacre.\nThe region kept producing high-calibre players in the 1930s like Merv Wallace, Paul Whitelaw, Bill Carson and Jack Cowie. Whitelaw and Carson also secured themselves a personal honour with a then world record partnership for the third wicket against Canterbury (this record is now held by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene). Auckland cricket was developing fast and producing a number of world-renowned players, but World War II saw the Plunket Shield suspended and many promising cricketers shipped overseas. A number of these players died whilst serving the armed services overseas including double All Black Bill Carson.\nAfter the War.\nAfter Auckland won the Plunket Shield in 1947, the competition became more even, with Otago and Wellington dominating the next decade of competition. Also in the 1950s Central Districts and Northern Districts entered the competition.\nThis period is not known for the success of Auckland, but for the astonishing performances of individuals. In a 1951 game against Canterbury, Merv Wallace remarkably steered the side to victory under extreme circumstances. Wallace broke a bone whilst fielding in Canterbury's first innings and came in at number nine in the batting order. He smashed 60 as he led the tail in a remarkable fightback that saw Auckland gain first innings by one run. If not impressive enough Wallace also pulled a calf muscle when on 26 going for a hook shot. In the second innings Auckland required six runs with six wickets in hand. Wallace did not expect to bat and was dressed casually ready to celebrate with his teammates. Following a monumental collapse he only had time to put his whites on over the top as he came to the wicket with Auckland nine down and needing one run to win. He hit the winning run off his first ball, cementing his place as an immortal in Auckland and New Zealand cricket history.\nIn September 2018, they were one of the six teams invited to play in the first edition of the Abu Dhabi T20 Trophy, scheduled to start in October 2018.\nChampions League Twenty 20.\nAfter winning the 2010-11 HRV Cup, the Aces qualified for the 2011 Champions League Twenty20. They were knocked out in the qualifying stage where they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders and Somerset. The Aces again qualified for the 2012 Champions League Twenty20 where they defeated the Sialkot Stallions and Hampshire to top the qualifying stage and made it through to the group stage. They defeated the Kolkata Knight Riders in the first match and lost to the Titans and the Perth Scorchers while the game vs Delhi Daredevils ended without a result. They finished last in the table.\nPersonnel.\nAt the beginning of each season Auckland Cricket announces 16 contracted players, this does not include players who hold a New Zealand Cricket contract. They are allowed one overseas professional for the Plunket Shield and Ford Trophy. New Zealand domestic sides are allowed to sign as many overseas players as required for the Super Smash, but only two imports are allowed in the side at any one time.\nCurrent squads.\nSource: Auckland cricket\nNotable players.\nNew Zealand \nEngland \nSri Lanka \nCanada \nWest Indies \nAustralia\nHong Kong\nRecords.\nSee List of New Zealand first-class cricket records"

This can result from a player getting the ball stolen, stepping out of bounds, having a pass intercepted, committing a violation (such as double dribble, traveling, shot clock violation, three-second violation or five-second violation), or committing an offensive foul (including personal, flagrant, and technical fouls).\nAccording to \"Boston Globe\" sportswriter Bob Ryan, the concept of the turnover was first formulated by his colleague Jack Barry. Turnovers were first officially recorded in the American Basketball Association (ABA) during the 1967–68 season. The NBA began tracking team turnovers during the 1973-74 season and started tracking turnovers for individual players during the 1977–78 season subsequent to the NBA-ABA merger. The WNBA has recorded turnovers since its inaugural season in 1997.\nRecords.\nNBA.\nThe record for the most turnovers in an NBA game is shared by Jason Kidd and John Drew. Kidd committed 14 turnovers against the New York Knicks on November 17, 2000 while playing for the Phoenix Suns. Drew committed 14 turnovers against the New Jersey Nets on March 1, 1978 while playing for the Atlanta Hawks. The record for most turnovers in an NBA playoff game was 13, set by James Harden on May 27, 2015 while playing for the Houston Rockets against the Golden State Warriors.\nLeBron James holds the regular season and playoff records for most career turnovers with 4,966 in the regular season and 1,015 in the playoffs. Russell Westbrook holds the record for highest career turnover average in the regular season with 4.1 turnovers per game.\nWNBA.\nThe record for the most turnovers by a WNBA team in one game is 33. The record for the most turnovers by a WNBA player per season is held by Ticha Penicheiro, who committed 135 turnovers in 1999. The career record for the most turnovers by a WNBA player is held by Sue Bird has the most turnovers in the WNBA with 1,370."

        "title": "1979 Challenge Cup (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The 1979 Challenge Cup was a series of international ice hockey games between the Soviet Union national ice hockey team and a team of All-Stars from the National Hockey League. The games were played on February 8, 10, and 11 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It replaced the NHL's all-star festivities for the 1978–79 NHL season. The Soviets defeated the NHL All-Stars two games to one.\nThe team of All-Stars from the National Hockey League included 23 Canadians and three Swedish players. Bobby Orr commenting in the post-game interviews after game two, accidentally called the NHL All-Stars \"Team Canada\" (because of the number of Canadians on the roster). The Challenge Cup, unlike its predecessor, the Summit Series, included non-Canadian born players in the NHL rosters.\nThe NHL All-Stars team was coached by Scotty Bowman, and the Soviet Union national team was coached by Viktor Tikhonov.\nUniforms.\nThe NHL vastly simplified their white All-Star uniforms, removing most of the striping and stars. The NHL shield on the front was enlarged, while the logos on the shoulders remained the same. The striping was reduced to two thin stripes, orange over black, separated by a thin white stripe. The names on the back remained in black with orange trim, and the numerals remained orange with black trim.\nThe Soviet team used their standard red national uniforms, which they also used when touring against the teams of the World Hockey Association (while billed as the \"Soviet All-Stars\"). The jerseys featured two white stripes at the waistline - one thin stripe over a wider stripe studded with red diamonds. The sleeve stripes followed a similar pattern, but without the diamonds on the wide stripes, and an additional white stripe below the wide band. While the Soviet team normally used Cyrillic script on its uniforms, the names on the back of the jerseys for the Challenge Cup were romanized for the event. The front of the jerseys retained the Cyrillic СССР initials.\nGame log.\nGame 1.\nScore.\nNHL All-Stars 4 - Soviet Union 2\nGame 2.\nScore.\nNHL All-Stars 4 - Soviet Union 5\nGame 3.\nScore.\nNHL All-Stars 0 - Soviet Union 6\nBroadcasters.\nIn the United States, Game 2, which was held on a Saturday afternoon, was shown on CBS as part of \"CBS Sports Spectacular\". The network refused to expand \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" to carry the game in full so instead, the show came on during the second intermission, showed taped highlights of the first two periods, and then showed the final period live. The lead-in to \"Sports Spectacular\" was \"The World's Strongest Man\". The then-CBS affiliate in Boston, the old WNAC-TV, broadcast a local college hockey game that led into \"Sports Spectacular\".\nThe network, the show and their sponsors had a problem with the rink board advertising that the NHL sold at Madison Square Garden, and refused to allow them to be shown on television. As a result, CBS viewers were unable to see the far boards above the yellow kickplate, and could only see players' skates when the play moved to that side of the ice. Games 1 and 3 were shown on the NHL Network, where the advertising was no problem.\nDan Kelly and Lou Nanne called the game for CBS while Dick Stockton served as the host."

        "text": "The United States national baseball team, also known as Team USA represents the United States in international-level baseball competitions. The team is currently ranked 2nd in the world by the World Baseball Softball Confederation. The United States has won many international tournaments, many of which are now discontinued. Most notably the team won the Olympic baseball tournament in 2000, and the World Baseball Classic (WBC) in 2017.\nThe United States national team debuted in the Baseball World Cup in 1938. The tournament was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the best-on-best World Baseball Classic. The United States won the tournament four times. In the 2000 Baseball Olympic games, the United States won their first Olympic gold in baseball.\nThe United States was an inaugural member of the World Baseball Classic, making its debut in the first edition. In their first three appearances in the WBC, the best finish for the Americans was fourth place in 2009. In 2017, the team won the WBC title for the first time by defeating Puerto Rico in the final game.\nTeam USA qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics by winning the eight-team Americas Qualifying Event in June 2021. In the Olympic competition, held in Tokyo in July and August 2021, the team won the silver medal, losing to hosts Japan in the gold medal game.\nThe team is governed by USA Baseball, and its headquarters/training facilities are located in Cary, North Carolina. Along with the professional national team, USA Baseball also fields a Collegiate, 18U, 15U, and 12U National baseball team. All of the teams contribute to the WBSC ranking of the US National team through various tournaments hosted by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.\nThroughout the years, many high-level players have been developed by USA Baseball, and have played on the national team before becoming professional players. Many players who are currently playing in Major League Baseball have also joined the team for the World Baseball Classic and Olympic baseball tournaments.\nCurrent roster.\nThe roster for the 2023 World Baseball Classic:\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball game results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nPrimary national team tournament records.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nIn , Major League Baseball announced the formation of the World Baseball Classic, a 16-nation international competition to be held in March of for the first time. The tournament was the first of its kind to have the national teams of IBAF's member federations feature professional players from the major leagues around the world, including Major League Baseball.\n2006: Inaugural Classic.\nOn January 17, , the United States announced its provisional 60-man roster (52 players in all), and whittled down the squad mixed with youth and experience to 30 players on February 14, 2006. Sixteen of the 30 Major League clubs were represented on the 2006 squad, including multiple representatives from the New York Yankees (4), Houston Astros (3), Washington Nationals (3), Atlanta Braves (2), Boston Red Sox (2), Chicago Cubs (2), Colorado Rockies (2), Houston Astros (2), and Texas Rangers (2). The fact that four Yankees were selected for the squad irked Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who was opposed to the WBC being held in the middle of spring training to the point where at his team's complex in Tampa, Florida, he posted a sign apologizing for their absence and mocking the tournament in the process. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig promptly ordered him to take down the sign the next day.\nManager Buck Martinez brought his 17 years of professional experience as a major league catcher, and 1+ seasons as Toronto Blue Jays' (–) skipper to the U.S. team. Former big league managers Davey Johnson and Marcel Lachemann served as hitting coach and pitching coach, respectively.\nAlong with fellow North American rivals Canada and Mexico, the U.S. hosted the South Africa. Round One games were held at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona and Scottsdale Stadium in Scottsdale, Arizona. The top two teams advanced to Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California.\nDespite a surprising loss to Canada, the United States advanced to the second round via tiebreaker. However, second-round losses to South Korea and Mexico allowed Japan to advance over the Americans via tiebreak.\n2009: America's second-best finish.\nThe United States competed in Pool C of the 2009 World Baseball Classic along with Italy, Venezuela, and host Canada. The U.S. won the pool opener against Canada by a score of 6-, and secured advancement into Round 2 by defeating Venezuela in a 15–6 slugfest. Venezuela, however, came back to defeat the U.S. in the championship game of Pool C, 5–3.\nOn March 14, in their first match of round 2 against Puerto Rico, in Miami, Florida's Dolphin Stadium, the United States was mercy ruled for the first time in international competition, losing 11–1 in seven innings. Adam Dunn and Captain Derek Jeter were among the ones to voice their distaste with the severe beating. Manager Davey Johnson even stated \"I should have stayed there\", referencing a wedding he was at earlier in the day.\nThe United States came on strong the following day against the surprising Netherlands (who had already eliminated a tournament super power: The Dominican Republic), jumping out to a 6–0 lead in the fourth inning, and winning 9–3. With Puerto Rico losing to Venezuela 2–0 the following day, the U.S. would face Puerto Rico once again in the qualifying round. The loser would be eliminated from the tournament. With Puerto Rico leading 5–3 in the 9th inning, singles by Shane Victorino and Brian Roberts and walks by Jimmy Rollins and Kevin Youkilis cut the lead to 5–4 for New York Mets third baseman David Wright, who looped a barely-fair single into right that brought in Roberts and Rollins to win the game, 6–5, advancing to the semifinals while eliminating Puerto Rico. The United States would go on to lose to Japan 9–4 in the second semifinal.\n2013: Stiffer competition; America misses the finals again.\nThe United States team competed in Pool D of the 2013 World Baseball Classic along with Italy, Canada, and Mexico. The U.S. team lost to Mexico in the first round 5–2, but later won two games against Canada and Italy, securing their place for the second round, along with Italy, on Pool 2.\nOn March 12, they beat Puerto Rico 7–1, which then proceeded to face off against the Dominican Republic on March 14, losing 3–1 where they face off Puerto Rico once again the next day, as Puerto Rico beat the American team 4–3 (as revenge for being eliminated from the 2009 World Baseball Classic), thus eliminating them from the tournament.\n2017: First championship.\nThe Americans won their first game over Colombia, 3–2, in 10 innings on a walk-off single by Adam Jones. After losing to the Dominican Republic after having a 5-run lead, the U.S. defeated Canada to reach the Second Round.\nIn the Second Round the Americans won the first game of the round defeating Venezuela 4–2. In the second game the U.S. was defeated by Puerto Rico 6–5 after giving up 4 runs in the 1st inning. The U.S. then defeated the Dominican Republic to advance to the Championship Round.\nIn the Championship Round Semifinals on March 21, the Americans defeated Japan 2–1 to advance to their first-ever appearance in the Final. In the Final on March 22, the U.S. once again faced Puerto Rico; the U.S. however, ended up winning 8–0 capturing the first ever World Baseball Classic Title for the United States. Following the conclusion of the tournament, Eric Hosmer, Christian Yelich, and Marcus Stroman were named to the 2017 All-World Baseball Classic team.\n2023: the Americans fail to repeat.\nTeam USA won their first game in pool play against Great Britain 6–2. They lost their next game against Mexico 11–5 in which would ultimately be their only pool play loss. The United States won their final two games against Canada and Columbia and advanced to the knockout stage.\nIn their quarterfinal matchup against Venezuela, the Americans were trailing 7–5 in the 8th when Trea Turner hit a go-ahead Grand Slam to win the game 9–7 for Team USA to advance to the semi-finals. There, the U.S. blew out Cuba 14–2 and advanced to the Championship round for the second time in a row.\nTheir Championship round opponent was a championship much anticipated for the WBC, which was Japan. The Americans took an early 1–0 lead on a Trea Turner homerun but could not close the door and lost to Japan, with the final score being 3–2. Trea Turner and Mike Trout were named to the 2023 All-World Baseball Classic team.\nOlympic Games.\nBackground.\nBaseball unofficially debuted at the Summer Olympics of 1904 in St. Louis. Single exhibition games were played in conjunction with five Olympics: 1912 in Stockholm, 1936 in Berlin, 1952 in Helsinki, 1956 in Melbourne, and 1964 in Tokyo. The 1952 exhibition was of a Finnish variant of baseball known as pesäpallo.\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was the first to feature a tournament in the program. Eight teams competed in the tournament held at Dodger Stadium. Cuba, after winning the gold medal at the 1983 Pan American Games, was to participate, but did not as a result of the Soviet-led boycott. The United States national team (Team USA) finished second, falling to Japan in the final game, 6–3. No official medals were awarded as baseball was a demonstration sport.\nBaseball returned as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Again an eight-team tournament, the United States finished first in the tournament, defeating Japan, 5–3, in the final game.\nBaseball became an official medal sport beginning with the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Competition was open only to male amateurs in 1992 and 1996. As a result, Team USA and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on college baseball players, while Cuba used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs as they nominally held other jobs. Professional baseball players were introduced in 2000, but the situation remained largely the same. No active players from Major League Baseball (MLB) competed—as MLB declined to release its players—so Team USA utilized minor-league players and free agents, while Cuba and some other nations were still able to use their best players, as they had no commitments with MLB.\nAt the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting on July 8, 2005, baseball and softball were voted out of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, becoming the first sports voted out of the Olympics since polo was eliminated from the 1936 Summer Olympics. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program following the 2008 games. Baseball returned to the Olympic program for the 2020 games, held in 2021 in Tokyo. It will not be part of the 2024 games in Paris, but is scheduled for the 2028 games in Los Angeles.\n1992: Fourth in Barcelona.\nTeam USA had a 5–2 record in pool play, then lost to Cuba in the semifinals, followed by a loss to Japan in the bronze-medal match.\nPitchers (8):\nPitcher / Outfielder (1):\nCatchers (2):\nInfielders (6):\nOutfielders (3):\nManager: Ron Fraser, Miami\nNote: Jason Moler of Cal State Fullerton was initially named to the squad as one of the catchers, but was replaced by Varitek due to injury prior to the start of the competition.\nSource:\n1996: Bronze in Atlanta.\nTeam USA had a 6–1 record in pool play, then lost to Japan in the semifinals, followed by a win over Nicaragua in the bronze-medal match.\nManager: Skip Bertman\nSource:\n2000: Gold in Sydney.\nTeam USA had a 6–1 record in pool play, then defeated South Korea in the semifinals, followed by a win over Cuba in the gold-medal game.\nManager: Tommy Lasorda\nSource:\n2008: Bronze in Beijing.\nTeam USA qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics by winning the American Qualifying Tournament. In Beijing, Team USA had a 5–2 record in pool play, then lost to Cuba in the semifinals, followed by a win over Japan in the bronze-medal match.\n2020: Silver in Tokyo.\nIn November 2019, with Scott Brosius as manager, the team initially failed to qualify at the 2019 WBSC Premier12 Tournament. The team subsequently qualified, with Mike Scioscia as manager, by winning the Americas Qualifying Event held from May 31 to June 5, 2021, in Florida. Luke Williams led the team in batting average (.444), runs (6), hits (8), and RBIs (6), Todd Frazier and Mark Kolozsvary led in home runs (2), and David Robertson led the team in saves (2).\nAt the Olympics, the team first won its three-team pool, via victories over South Korea and Israel. In the modified double-elimination bracket, the team lost to Japan in the second round, then defeated the Dominican Republic in the repechage and South Korea in the semi-finals and advanced to the gold medal game where the team lost to Japan for the second time. Team Japan was made up of players from Nippon Professional Baseball, which paused its season for the Olympics, while Team USA fielded minor-league players and free agents with major-league experience.\nThe team's roster for the Olympics was released on July 2, 2021.\nPremier12 Tournament.\n2015.\nTeam USA came in second in the 2015 WBSC Premier12 Tournament.\n2019.\nTeam USA came in fourth in the 12-team 2019 WBSC Premier12 Tournament in November 2019. Two quota spots were allocated from the Tournament, of the spots for six baseball teams at the 2020 Olympic Games, with third-place Mexico as the top finisher from the Americas earning one spot and Team USA not earning a spot. Team USA did not include players who were on their teams' 40-man MLB rosters, being made up of minor league players, including former First Round MLB draft picks Jo Adell, Tanner Houck, and Brent Rooker (2017 MLB draft), Alec Bohm and Xavier Edwards (2018 MLB draft), and Andrew Vaughn (2019 MLB draft). Other teams used their top-level players.\nAmateur World Series and Baseball World Cup.\nThe U.S. lost the inaugural Amateur World Series in 1938. The U.S. won its first Amateur World Series in , and repeated a year later.\nIn , the Amateur World Series became the International Baseball Federation's (IBAF) World Cup.\nSince 1938, the U.S. has won 15 medals at the Baseball World Cup: four gold (1973, 1974, 2007, 2009), seven silver (1938, 1969, 1970, 1972, 1978, 1988, 2001), and four bronze (1939, 1940, 1982, 1984).\nThe U.S. was usually represented by college players in these tournaments, while Cuba used its best players.\n2007.\nThe U.S. was in group A of the IBAF World Cup, along with Republic of China, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Italy, Spain and South Africa. The U.S. went 6–1 to win their group, with their only loss coming on November 9, against Italy. It was the U.S.'s first loss to Italy in 21 years and the first time it ever lost to Italy with professional players, as the team consisted of minor league prospects.\nThis one loss, however, would be their only. The U.S. went on to beat Korea, Netherlands, and Cuba to capture the gold.\n2009.\nIn Round 1 of the 2009 Baseball World Cup, the U.S. (2–1) finished second in Group E and advanced with first-place Venezuela (3–0). In Round 2, the U.S. was joined by the nine other first- and second-place teams from Round 1, four wild-card teams, and the two principal host teams (Italy and the Netherlands). The 16 teams were divided into Groups F and G. The U.S. (7–0) defeated each of the other seven teams in Group G. In Round 3, the first four teams in Group F were renamed Group 1 and the first four teams in Group G were renamed Group 2. The U.S. finished first in Group 2 with a record of 7–0; Cuba finished first in Group 1, with a 5–2 record. In the Final Round, Group 1 and 2's fourth-place teams competed for overall seventh place; the two third-place teams competed for overall fifth place; and the two second-place teams competed for the bronze medal. In the gold-medal game, the U.S. defeated Cuba, 10–5.\nTournament awards were given to Justin Smoak (MVP) and Todd Redmond (best won/loss average (pitcher)). Smoak (first base) was also named to the tournament All-Star Team, along with Jon Weber (outfield) and Terry Tiffee (designated hitter).\nIntercontinental Cup.\nThe Intercontinental Cup is a tournament between the members of the IBAF. It was first held in in Italy, and was held every other year following until . Since, there has been a competition in &amp; , both of which, the U.S. has chosen to sit out. The tournament has been dominated by Cuba, who has won ten gold &amp; three silver in the 16 tournaments. Japan is second in medal ranking, with two gold, five silver &amp; five bronze, and the U.S. is third, with two gold, four silver &amp; two bronze. The United States use college players in this tournament, while Cuba sends its best players.\nFuture big leaguers have competed in the Intercontinental Cup for the U.S. including Joe Carter, Terry Francona, Mickey Morandini, John Olerud, and Robin Ventura.\nPan American Games.\nThe U.S. and Cuba have been archrivals at the Pan American Games ever since the event began in . The U.S. has finished second behind Cuba eight of the 12 times they have brought home the gold. Likewise, when the U.S. won the gold medal at the 1967 Pan American Games, Cuba finished second. The U.S. roster is usually composed of promising college players, while Cuba is able to send its best players.\nIn total, the U.S. has won one gold medal, ten silver medals, and three bronze. The only games the U.S. failed to medal in were and . For the 1995 games, the U.S. did not send their national team, but instead the St. John's University baseball team, who finished 0–4 against the international all-star teams.\nCollegiate National Team.\nUSA Baseball also fields a Collegiate National Team which has 22 members of top collegiate baseball players in the country, consisting of five infielders, four outfielders, two catchers, nine pitchers, and a pair of two-way players.

        "text": "The Beach Soccer World Championships was the premier international beach soccer competition contested by men's national teams between 1995 and 2004. It was replaced by the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\nThe tournament took place annually in Brazil under the supervision of Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) and its predecessors, crowning the world champions of the sport. Due to the sport's rapid growth, FIFA took an interest in it, and as the main tournament in world beach soccer, it joined hands with BSWW in 2005 to take over the organization of the competition, re-branding it as an official FIFA tournament.\nBrazil were the most successful team, winning nine of the ten tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe first Beach Soccer World Championship was held in Brazil, in 1995, organised by the precursors to the modern-day founders of the standardised rules, Beach Soccer Worldwide, held under the title \"Beach Soccer World Championship\". Eight teams were selected to take part, without going through a qualification process. However Brazil, the hosts, dominated and easily won the cup without losing a game. The tournament was successful and BSWW announced that the competition would take place every year.\nBy 1997, more teams had already stated their interest in participating and therefore BSWW extended their selection to 10 teams for 1998. Brazil continued to dominate, despite this change. Immediately, BSWW extended to 12 teams for 1999, spreading their selection across five continents, introducing more new teams to the tournament.\nHowever, with all these changes it still took until the 2001 World Cup for Brazil to lose the title after winning the competition six years on the run since the establishment. It was Portugal who won the tournament, with Brazil finishing in a disappointing fourth place.\nWith this change of champions, more countries thought there was a chance for themselves to win the tournament and this sparked more interest worldwide. Not surprisingly, Brazil reclaimed their title in 2002, when BSWW reduced the number of contestants back to eight.\nThe last \"Beach Soccer World Championship\" to be organised purely by BSWW was in 2004 when twelve teams played, before being replaced by the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup the next year.\nResults.\nTeams reaching the top four.\nOverall, half of the 24 nations who ever competed made a top four finish; only two won the title. Brazil were by far the most successful nation, winning nine titles of the possible ten. Portugal claimed the only crown Brazil did not win. \nBrazil were also the only nation to finish in the final four of every championship.\nTournament appearances.\n24 countries participated over the ten competitions, however nearly half (11) only appeared at one edition. Three participated in all World Championships: Brazil, Italy and Uruguay. European teams dominated in unique appearances by continent, since half of all countries were from Europe. Oceania were the only region never to be represented at least once.\nOnly eight of the 24 countries have failed to reappear at a FIFA controlled World Cup. Peru (5) appeared in the most competitions without yet participating in a FIFA World Cup.\nOverall team records.\nIn this ranking 3 points are awarded for a win in normal time, 2 points for a win in extra time or penalty shoot-out and 0 for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then by goal difference, then by goals scored. Only the points for the first 10 World Championships that occurred between 1995 and 2004 are counted here. \nAwards.\nThe following documents the winners of the awards presented at the conclusion of the tournament. Three awards were consistently bestowed at each event.\nTop goalscorers.\nFrom the data available, the below table shows the top 20 goalscorers of the World Championships.\nAttendance figures.\nNote that attendance records are not available between 1995 and 2002."

        "text": "The New Zealand National Basketball League (NZNBL) is a men's semi-professional basketball league in New Zealand.\nHistory.\nThe 1980s ushered in a period of exceptional growth and popularity for basketball in New Zealand. Late in 1981, six men's teams – a mixture of club and provincial representative sides – went out alone and created an inaugural national league. It was enough of a success to come under the control of the New Zealand Basketball Federation the following year, when it grew in size and secured a naming sponsor. An allowance of two imported players (invariably Americans with college basketball experience) per team, and the fact that games were played in the evening indoors, helped turn the league into a new family entertainment option. Spectators filled gymnasiums and media coverage reached unprecedented levels. The early 1990s held dwindling fortunes for New Zealand basketball and many teams in the NZNBL, with reduced TV coverage, sponsorships, and crowd numbers. With the success of the Tall Blacks at the 2002 FIBA World Championship and the introduction of the New Zealand Breakers in the Australian NBL in 2003, basketball in New Zealand rose in popularity again.\nThe number of teams each season has constantly changed since the league's inception, with many promotions and relegations between the first division and second division during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as many withdrawals due to financial reasons. The league began with 8 teams in 1982, then peaked at 13 teams in 1995, before dropping to a low of 7 in 2016. In 2019, the Southern Huskies from Tasmania became the first ever Australian team to join a New Zealand competition. The league returned to 7 teams in 2020 following a revised small-scale format due to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2022, the league was hailed for reaching competitive balance after years of unbalanced competition, with evenly spread talent and resources across the ten teams.\nLeague eligibility rules.\nThere are two categories of players in the NZNBL:\nBroadcasting details.\nIn 2016 and 2017, the NZNBL began to more freely livestream and broadcast their games. In 2020, the league had all 75 games broadcast by Sky Sport, marking the first time in the league's four-decade history that every game would be made available to viewers across the nation. That same year, the league secured a deal to broadcast live in the United States through ESPN.\nIn 2022, the NZNBL and Sky Sport signed a five-year commercial deal estimated to be worth $7.5 million for the teams."

        "title": "Rugby union in Scotland",
        "text": "Rugby union in Scotland () is a popular team sport. Scotland's national side today competes in the annual Six Nations Championship and the Rugby World Cup. The first ever international rugby match was played on 27 March 1871, at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh, when Scotland defeated England in front of 4,000 people. Professional clubs compete in the United Rugby Championship, European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup, while the Scottish League Championship exists for over 200 amateur and semi-professional clubs, as does a knock-out competition, the Scottish Cup. The governing body, the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), is one of the ten first-tier member nations of World Rugby.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body of the game in Scotland is the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), who operate the Scottish national team.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThere is a long tradition of \"football\" games in Scotland, and many of these such as Jeddart Ball bear more resemblance to rugby than association football, since passing and carrying by hand play a large part in them. The Kirkwall Ba game still takes place, and involves scrummaging. Scottish soccer enthusiasts also cite these games as ancestral to their sport.\nThere is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \"pass\" in the most recent translation is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later ' (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \"goal\" is ', literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \"Throw yourself against him\" (\"\"). It is clear that the game was rough and tackles allowed included the \"charging\" and pushing/holding of opposing players (\"drive that man back\" in the original translation, \"repelle eum\" in original Latin). It has been suggested that this game bears similarities to rugby football.\nContrary to media reports in 2006 there is no reference to forward passing, game rules, marking players or team formation. These reports described it as \"an amazing new discovery\" but has actually been well documented in football history literature since the early 20th century and available on the internet since at least 2000.\n1800s–present.\nThe world's oldest continual rugby fixture was first played in 1858 between Merchiston Castle School and the former pupils of The Edinburgh Academy.\nScotland was responsible for organising the very first rugby International when a side representing England met the Scottish national side on the cricket field of the Edinburgh Academy at their Raeburn Place ground on 27 March 1871; Scotland won by one goal. The Scottish Football Union (SFU) - later named SRU - was founded in 1873 (in the Staff Common Room at The Glasgow Academy) and was a founding member of the International Rugby Board in 1886 with Ireland and Wales. (England refused to join until 1890).\nSince that time, Scotland have been regular winners of the Calcutta Cup, the five nations championship (discontinued), and have been participants of (having never actually won) the Six Nations Championship, and every Rugby World Cup.\nScotland has played a seminal role in the development of rugby, notably in rugby sevens, which were initially conceived by Ned Haig, a butcher from Melrose as a fundraising event for his local club in 1883. The first ever officially sanctioned international tournament of rugby occurred at Murrayfield as part of the \"Scottish Rugby Union's celebration of rugby\" centenary celebrations in 1973. Due to the success of the format, the ongoing Hong Kong Sevens was launched three years later. In 1993, the Rugby World Cup Sevens was launched and the trophy is known as the \"Melrose Cup\" in memory of Ned Haig's invention.\nIn 1924 the SFU changed its name to the Scottish Rugby Union. International games were played at Inverleith from 1899 to 1925 when Murrayfield was opened.\nCompetitions.\nHistorically rugby union was an amateur sport, but the dawn of professionalism changed the way in which the game was structured. The game is divided into professional and non-professional spheres.\nPreviously there had been a domestic league that covered the country, the top division of which was essentially the elite of club rugby in Scotland. This league was established in the early 1970s to replace the complicated \"unofficial championship\" that had been competed for previously. Starting in the 1973–74 season, the clubs were organised into a league of six divisions - what today comprises the Scottish Premiership and National League elements of the League Championship. Originally, below the six divisions (but not connected by promotion or relegation) were a series of District Leagues, covering smaller geographical areas, organised by District Unions and sometimes involving second XVs. Over a period of time, these District divisions have been reformed and integrated into the Scottish rugby union system meaning that today, only four clubs do not have their first XVs in the interconnected league structure.\nThe entire system is sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland (or RBS), making it known as the \"RBS League Championship\". This league contains Scottish rugby union's traditional big name clubs, such as Melrose and Hawick, as well as major city clubs such as Boroughmuir, Heriots and Watsonians from Edinburgh, and Glasgow Hawks who were formed from an amalgamation of clubs in the 1990s.\nClubs.\nTraditionally, rugby clubs were often formed by universities, ex-pupils of independent schools and large state schools, and many clubs names still to this day include abbreviations such as:\nHowever, with the introduction of the league system in the 1970s and the resulting increase in competitiveness and standard of play, most of these clubs have had to loosen their participation criteria to include non ex-pupils. In most cases though the clubs squads do still comprise a large proportion of individuals with connections to the schools. Often the clubs will be part-financed, and their grounds maintained or even owned, by the schools themselves. In recent years the success of traditional 'Borders' league clubs such as Gala, Hawick etc were superimposed by the new breed of clubs such as Ayr RFC, Glasgow Hawks and Stirling County with Ayr securing three Premiership and Cup wins since 2008.\nAmalgamations of clubs are also reasonably frequent, and when this occurs the clubs often combine names, as in Hillhead Jordanhill RFC or Waysiders/Drumpellier RFC.\nOther leagues.\nScotland is also home to the oldest organised rugby union league in the world, the Border League, which was formed in 1901. The Border League does not take part in the pyramid structure of the National League, but all its clubs participate in it (and thus the Border League is now effectively a supplementary competition). Two small 'independent' leagues remain outside the system, the Highland Alliance League and the Grampian Alliance League but they have only four clubs between them (the remaining membership being second XVs of clubs in the League Championship) and are not likely to remain in existence for much longer.\nAside from the schools, the other 'traditional powerhouse' of rugby in Scotland was the universities, and to this day the Scottish universities have their own league system independent of the BUCS system which covers the rest of Great Britain. However, the BUCS Scottish Conference comprises divisions of four or five teams, and therefore not many fixtures each season, so unofficial Saturday University Leagues are organised (somewhat informally) between the universities. As well as having their own leagues the universities often compete in the SRU league structure and cup competitions to a high standard, most notably in 2007–08 Aberdeen University became the first university side to make the SHE SRU finals day winning the Plate competition. The significance of the universities to the history of the SRU is evident when it is noted that four of the oldest 17 SRU affiliated clubs are university teams.\nDue to the social and amateur nature of the game, most clubs try to run as many teams as possible so that players get games on most weekends, and therefore a large system of what are effectively reserve leagues operate. Known as second XV, third XV, fourth XV, etc. depending on the quality of the players making up each team, their competitive activities were formally all supervised by The Scottish 2nd XV League - however in recent years disputes and breakaways have led to the formation of independent 2nd XV leagues in the Scottish Borders and in and around Edinburgh.\nSee University Leagues in Scotland and 2nd XV Leagues in Scotland for details. For schools rugby see Brewin Dolphin Scottish Schools Cup.\nChanges for the professional era.\nWhen professionalism was introduced into rugby union in the 1990s, and the Heineken Cup created for clubs across Europe, the SRU decided that the existing clubs operating in the Scottish leagues were not competitive enough. They were predominantly amateur, or at best paid small wages; they had low supports and small old-fashioned venues; and the quality of their play was, by the nature of these factors, comparatively low versus new professional clubs, provinces and regions in other countries. As a rule their players trained only two nights a week.\nScotland has the oldest District provincial rugby sides in the world. The Glasgow - Edinburgh district derby was first played in 1872, hence the 1872 Cup played today. The District sides traditionally drew together the best amateur players from clubs in a given area; and the Scottish Inter-District Championship was founded in 1953. There were four standard districts – Glasgow District; Edinburgh District; North and Midlands; and South – they occasionally competed with an Anglo-Scots or Exile side as a fifth district in the Championship.\nThe SRU decided to turn these standard Districts into four professional teams based roughly on the old districts: the Border Reivers based in Galashiels (with occasional matches elsewhere), the Caledonia Reds based in Aberdeen and Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow.\nThe aim of creating these 'pro-teams' or 'super-teams' was ensure that Scotland had fairly competitive sides operating in the European competitions, the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup (as well as the European Shield during its short existence), and to drive up standards of rugby in the country including developing players for the national side.\nInitially the 'pro-teams' were still competing in the Scottish Inter-District Championship, but a Welsh-Scottish League later developed, and from that development came the Celtic League with Ireland's introduction (and for a time there was also a cup competition, the Celtic Cup). The Celtic League has further expanded and is now known as the Pro14 and consists of Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Italian and South African sides.\nFrom four teams to two.\nThe four professional teams struggled in European competition and were a heavy financial burden for the union and for the formation of the Celtic League they were amalgamated into Edinburgh Reivers and Glasgow Caledonian Reds playing in Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively, and later renamed simply Edinburgh and Glasgow.\nAfter a few seasons with two teams, the SRU then reformed a Borders team, initially known as Border Reivers, then renamed The Borders, before reverting to Border Reivers again. At the time of this last change the other two sides were renamed Edinburgh Gunners and Glasgow Warriors. However, the SRU's extreme financial difficulties (they were over £20M in debt) forced yet another re-think (especially when the Border Reivers were rooted to the bottom of the Celtic League season after season) – at the end of season 2005–06, Edinburgh Gunners were sold to a private consortium led by Alex Carruthers, and renamed Edinburgh Rugby.\nContinuing difficulties.\nHowever, even with the running costs of two instead of three teams, the SRU were still struggling. Attempts were made to find private backers for Glasgow or the Borders (although the only investors interested in the latter wanted to move it to Falkirk, Stirling or Aberdeen) but in the end neither of the teams could be sold. As a result, at the end of 2006–07 the SRU yet again disbanded the Border Reivers, leaving Scotland with two pro-teams, one under private and one under SRU control.\nThe relationship with Alex Carruthers and his ERC Group which owned Edinburgh Rugby proved to be very uncomfortable. The SRU defaulted on payments of competition prize money to ERC, requiring the consortium to invest their own additional funds, and the SRU refused to share bar takings from Edinburgh Rugby matches at Murrayfield with ERC - at the same time, the SRU was unhappy about the signing policy and the unavailability of players for international team training.\nFollowing a bitter dispute in the press and media during 2007, in which legal action was started, and for a time Edinburgh Rugby was banned from participating in matches, the SRU agreed to buy back Edinburgh Rugby from Alex Carruthers. This caused much unrest in the Scottish Borders, as their team had been wound up only months before, when the SRU insisted it could not finance two pro-teams on its own.\nThe SRU announced shortly after its buy-back that it intended to rename Edinburgh Rugby as Edinburgh RFC in the future.\nFrom 2014–15. the Heineken Cup and original European Challenge Cup were respectively replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup. Scotland was guaranteed one place in the Champions Cup, awarded to the Scottish team that finished higher in the previous Pro12 season. The other Scottish team could qualify for the Champions Cup if it was one of the three Pro12 clubs with the best record, outside of the top team from each Pro12 nation (Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Wales). Additionally, starting in 2015–16, the second Scottish team could potentially qualify through a play-off involving another Pro12 side and one each from the English Premiership and France's Top 14. Otherwise, that team will participate in the Challenge Cup.\nWith Pro12 adding two South African teams in 2017–18, leading to that competition adopting its current name of Pro14, the qualification system for the Champions Cup was changed. Effective with the 2017–18 Pro14 season, the top three teams from each of Pro14's two conferences, excluding the South African sides, automatically qualify for the following season's Champions Cup. The previous requirement that each Celtic nation and Italy be represented in the Champions Cup was eliminated. A seventh place in the Champions Cup is awarded to the winner of a play-off between the next best-placed eligible team (again excluding South African sides) from each conference. As in the past, Scottish sides that do not qualify for the Champions Cup receive a place in the Challenge Cup.\nMost recently, the SRU has invested in Major League Rugby, a fledgling professional league based in the United States. MLR launched in 2018 with seven teams in the United States, and expanded to nine in 2019 with the addition of single teams in the U.S. and Canada. The SRU purchased a minority stake in Washington, D.C.-based Old Glory DC, one of three U.S. teams set to join MLR in 2020.\nPopularity.\nRugby union is one of the national sports of Scotland. It is most popular in the Borders region where it is played widely, although even here ground is being lost to football, with professionalism and migration contributing to the challenges facing the game . In the rest of the country rugby tends to be played mainly by private schools.\nWhilst attendances at club matches in Scotland are fairly poor, the national team draws a sizeable crowd to Murrayfield for Six Nations matches. Some traditionalists claim that in recent years the national rugby union team has become a focal point for football-type sporting nationalism.\nAside from Murrayfield, there are few major rugby stadiums in Scotland. Many clubs in the Scottish Borders have grandstands and city sides in Edinburgh and Glasgow also have seated, covered stands.\nStatistics.\nAccording to the International Rugby Board as of September 2010, Scotland has 241 rugby union clubs; 343 referees; 7,556 pre-teen male players; 13,402 teen male players; 10,556 senior male players (total male players 31,514) as well as 1,303 (total) female players. However, many pre teen players are not registered with the SRU.\nDemographics.\nRugby union is particularly popular in the Borders region. The towns of Hawick, Galashiels, Jedburgh and Selkirk have produced many international players.\nNational team.\nThe first international rugby union match in the world was played between England and Scotland in Edinburgh in 1871. Scotland won 4–1. The national side is considered by the IRB to belong in the top tier of nations, although they are not as competitive as the elite sides such as New Zealand or South Africa. They usually play their home matches at Murrayfield Stadium in the West End of Edinburgh.\nScotland contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the Six Nations Championship. The Calcutta Cup was last won by Scotland in the 2021 Six Nations Championship beating England 11-6.\nEvery four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from Scotland as well as England, Ireland and Wales. Scottish players are also regularly selected to represent The Barbarians.\nScottish Sports Hall of Fame.\nThe following rugby players have been inducted to the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame:\nAt least two other rugby players were inducted primarily for achievements in other sports—Eric Liddell in athletics, and Leslie Balfour-Melville (1854–1937), who played many other sports, as an all-rounder."

        "text": "The English cricket team in the West Indies in 1953–54 played five Test matches, five other first-class matches and seven other games, three of them on a two-week stop-over in Bermuda that included Christmas.\nUltimately the tour could be considered a success for England in cricketing terms, as they came back from 2–0 down to draw the series 2–2 against strong opposition. However the tour had its problems, both on and off the field. The West Indians were disappointed by the English party's reluctance to socialise and the defensive nature of much of their cricket. The English players were dissatisfied with the quality of some of the umpiring. There was crowd trouble at two of the Tests. Tony Lock was called for throwing in the first Test.\nEnglish team.\nThe team of 16 selected by MCC for the tour was arguably the strongest available. It was the first England touring team in modern times to be led by a professional captain.\nThe team was: \nOnly Palmer, Moss and Suttle had not played Test cricket before the tour, and only Suttle did not play in any of the Tests on the tour.\nWest Indian team.\nThe West Indies had played a home five-Test series against the Indians early in 1953, winning the series by 1–0 with four matches drawn. Of the team that played India, Allan Rae had retired and wicketkeeper Ralph Legall was not chosen for any of the Tests against England. The following existing Test players were selected in the sides to play England:\nIn addition, four players who had played in earlier Test series were recalled:\nThe West Indies introduced four players new to Test cricket during the series:\nTest series summary.\nFive Test matches were played. The West Indies won the first two, England the third. The fourth match was left drawn after six days and England won the fifth and final match to draw the series.\nFirst Test.\nThe West Indies introduced three new players – Frederick, Holt and McWatt – and recalled Headley and Kentish. In so doing, Headley became the oldest cricketer to play for West Indies. With consistent batting, West Indies made 417, with five players reaching 50 and Holt top-scoring with 94. After Holt was out, adjudged lbw, the wife and son of the umpire, Perry Burke, were attacked in the crowd, though they were not seriously hurt. England's reply was woeful, Ramadhin and Valentine taking seven wickets in a total of 170 all out. West Indies captain Stollmeyer was booed by the crowd for not enforcing the follow-on, and he declared at 209 for six wickets, setting England 457 to win. At 277 for two, with Watson making a century, the game looked even. But England lost seven wickets for eight runs and were all out for 316, Kentish taking five wickets for 49 runs. Lock was no-balled for throwing, the first such instance in a Test match since Ernie Jones at Melbourne for Australia against England in 1897–98.\nSecond Test.\nWalcott scored 220 out of a first-innings total of 383. England then batted painfully slowly, taking 150 overs to make 181 runs. Stollmeyer again did not enforce the follow-on: Holt made a maiden Test century, 166 out of a total of 292 for two declared. Needing 495 to win, England reached 258 for three before another collapse left them all out for 313.\nThird Test.\nEngland batted first and made 435 through Hutton's 169 and consistent batting from the others. Though Weekes made 94 and McWatt and the injured Holt added 99 for the eighth wicket, West Indies were all out for 251. The crowd threw bottles and other objects when McWatt was adjudged run out, but Hutton refused to take his players from the pitch. Following on, West Indies fared little better, scoring 256 and leaving England just 73 to win. Moss, who made his debut in the first Test, took five wickets.\nFourth Test.\nOn a batsman's wicket, the sides took the first five days to complete the first two innings. West Indies' 681 for eight declared was the highest score by a West Indies cricket team: Weekes made 206, Worrell 167 and Walcott 124. England made 537 in reply, with centuries from May and Compton and 92 from Graveney. The game petered out on the sixth day.\nFifth Test.\nWest Indies, winning the toss, were bowled out for 139 on what had appeared to be a perfect pitch for batting. Bailey took seven wickets for 34 runs, his best Test return. England's reply of 414 was based on a double century for Hutton and some later hitting by Wardle. Facing arrears of 275, West Indies lost wickets consistently, and though Walcott made his third century of the series, England needed just 72 to win. The match was the Test debut of Sobers, aged 17: he scored 14 not out and 26 and took four wickets.\nOther matches.\nThe MCC team played five first-class matches, winning against Jamaica, Barbados, British Guiana (Guyana) and Trinidad and drawing a second match against Jamaica.\nIn minor matches, MCC won one and drew two in Bermuda, won one and drew one in Jamaica, beat the Leeward Islands and drew with the Windward Islands, the latter two teams not being first-class in 1954.\nIssues arising from the tour.\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack 1955 edition reported that the tour was beset by controversy. Billed as a kind of world championship, the Test series was subject to much partisanship on the part of both West Indians and English expatriates; umpiring decisions added to the controversy, with the MCC team feeling hard done by over several decisions by local umpires and the crowds reacting with violence over two decisions that went England's way in the First and Third Tests. Wisden recommended that the West Indies draw up a panel of umpires from all the countries rather than using local umpires in each match. But it also had harsh words for England players whose dissent was made public, and also for the excessive caution of the England team in the Second Test. The experiment of using a player-manager on a controversial tour, Wisden said, was also \"not to be commended\"."

        "title": "Basketball (The Office)",
        "text": "\"Basketball\" is the fifth and penultimate episode of the first season of the American comedy television series \"The Office\". The episode aired on NBC in the United States on April 19, 2005. The episode was written and directed by producer Greg Daniels, marking both his first solo writing credit and first directing credit for the series. This episode also marks the first appearance of comedian Patrice O'Neal.\nIn this episode, Michael Scott (played by Steve Carell) and the office staff take on the workers in the warehouse in a basketball game. The episode was inspired by a deleted scene from the first episode where Michael talks about a pick-up basketball game. For two days, the cast of \"The Office\" played actual basketball games, which were then spliced together to give the effect of one continuous game. Several lines from the episode became fans and cast favorites. \"Basketball\" was viewed by an estimated 5.0 million viewers and received a 2.4/6% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode received positive reviews from critics.\nSynopsis.\nThe office staff are pitted against the warehouse in a game of basketball, with the losers having to work on Saturday. Michael Scott picks Jim Halpert, Ryan Howard, and Stanley Hudson, the last of whom he believes possesses significant basketball skills based on a racial stereotype. He also reluctantly picks Dwight Schrute and Phyllis Lapin, but refuses to pick Oscar Martinez or Kevin Malone. Pam Beesly has plans for an outing on the lake with her fiance Roy Anderson Saturday, provided the warehouse team wins. Jim half-jokingly proposes to Pam that if the office team wins, he will claim Roy's Saturday date with her.\nThe game begins and Stanley proves to be a horrible player. Furthermore, Michael cannot make a shot, nor is he a fan of passing or defending. Upon gaining possession of the ball, Michael fools around and teases his opponents, which results in Roy snatching the ball and scoring against Michael's team. He blames the scoring on his teammates' ineptitude. Jim switches with Michael on defense and defends Roy. Taking his wager with Pam seriously, Jim plays aggressively against Roy and shows his prowess at the game, with Pam looking on. Michael is accidentally hit in the face and claims it is a \"flagrant personal intentional foul\". He stops the game and declares the office winners since they were winning when the foul occurred. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, conceding the victory to the warehouse staff. As everybody returns to work, Kevin demonstrates his excellent shooting skills.\nMichael, faced with taking the blame for their loss, tells the office staff that they do not have to come in on Saturday either. However, his justification does little to calm them: \"Like coming in an extra day is going to prevent us from being downsized.\"\nProduction.\n\"Basketball\" was written and directed by producer Greg Daniels. Although he wrote the episode, Daniels was not originally scheduled to direct \"Basketball\". Rainn Wilson remarked that he really pushed for Daniels to direct the episode. John Krasinski applauded Daniels for being the first writer to \"take [the characters] out of the office\". Daniels later said that his favorite shot from the episode was when Michael takes Ryan on a tour of the warehouse because \"you got to see the whole basketball [set]\". The editors' cut for the episode was 40 minutes long. During the commentary for the episode, Steve Carell argued that the American version of \"The Office\" was more difficult to shoot because the British version was 29 minutes long, whereas the American version could only be 22 minutes.\nThe inspiration for the episode was a deleted scene from the pilot episode where Michael talks about a pick-up basketball game. During filming, the cast and crew were filmed playing real basketball games for two days, with three crew members spraying fake sweat on their faces, hair, and clothes. The takes were then spliced together to make it appear as if only one game had taken place. NBC was worried about the episode because several of their other pilots had done basketball episodes. The network put a lot of pressure on the cast and crew to make the episode appear \"as realistic as it could be\". Donald Lee Harris designed the warehouse set, which Krasinski described as \"amazing\" and \"detailed\".\nSeveral of the actors had basketball experience, such as Krasinski, who played for his high school team. Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin, succeeded in making 14 consecutive free-throw shots, of which several were included in the final footage. Steve Carell later said of his basketball skills, \"The thing about looking like you're bad at basketball is, it's like anything else, you have to be incredibly good in order to look bad [...] but that's not the case with me and basketball. I just was bad.\" However, Carell said that he would \"kick ass\" at an upcoming hockey episode. He was presumably referring to an episode which was never produced, since the only hockey episode during his run, \"Threat Level Midnight\", aired over five years after he made this statement, although an episode set at a skating rink (\"Michael's Birthday\") appeared during season 2.\n\"Basketball\" contained several lines that became cast favorites. Two of Michael's lines, \"The hand strikes and gives a flower\" and \"Blessed be those who sit and wait\" were described by Wilson as Confucian and biblical, respectively. Michael's line \"Try not to be too gay on the court\" was improvised by Carell and Krasinski's reaction was real. However, Phyllis Smith's reaction to Michael's disgust at the idea of her being a cheerleader was acted.\nReception.\nRatings.\nIn its original American broadcast on April 19, 2005, \"Basketball\" was viewed by an estimated 5.0 million viewers and received a 2.4/6% rating share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.4% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode, airing after \"Scrubs\", retained 92 percent of its lead-in audience.\nReviews.\nThe episode received moderately positive reviews from critics. Travis Fickett from \"IGN\" retroactively gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, signifying a \"good\" episode. Fickett commented that \"Basketball\" was stylistically different from most of the other episodes in the fledgling series, pointing to its lack of a sub-plot and its characterization of Michael Scott. Fickett, when discussing the latter, singled out the moment wherein Michael hurts Phyllis' feelings by telling her she can't play basketball, writing, \"The moment is played mostly straight–and it does feel more realistic and uncomfortable and in that way, the show leans more towards the feel of the UK series. It's a great moment, but feels like a different show.\" Overall, he wrote that, \"There is still quite a bit of funny stuff [in 'Basketball'], but in many ways, this episode suggests what the show would have been like had it taken a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style.\" Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an \"A−\". Jenna Mullins from E! News referred to \"Basketball\" as her \"all-time favorite episode of \"The Office\"\" in an article about Steve Carell's last episode of the series.\nNot all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of \"The A.V. Club\" awarded the episode a \"C+\" and highly criticized the characterization of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him out to be a jerk because the series has not worked at showing that he truly \"isn't a complete asshole\". Adams noted that Michael \"could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. But that would be an outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isn't funny.\" Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the \"episode's original cut ran too long to air, and it's obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode\"."

As an assistant coach, Caldwell was the assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach for the Colts team that won Super Bowl XLI and the offensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens team that won Super Bowl XLVII.\nCollege career.\nCaldwell attended the University of Iowa, where he was a four-year starter at defensive back for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team from 1973 to 1976.\nCoaching career.\nCollege.\nCaldwell served as an assistant coach at the University of Iowa, Southern Illinois University, Northwestern University, University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Louisville, and Pennsylvania State University before being named head coach at Wake Forest University in 1993. He was the first African American head football coach in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Caldwell was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa - The National Leadership Honor Society at Wake Forest in 1996.\nIn eight years, Caldwell had a record of 26–63. He installed a powerful passing attack that set numerous school records, many of which have since been broken under his successor, Jim Grobe. However, his teams rarely ran well; in one year the Demon Deacons' leading rusher only notched 300 yards for the entire season. He only had one winning season, in 1999, when the Deacons won the Aloha Bowl.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nCaldwell joined Tony Dungy's staff with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2001 as quarterbacks coach. He followed Dungy to Indianapolis in 2002 and remained with him for his entire tenure, helping lead the Colts to a win in Super Bowl XLI.\nOn January 13, 2008, Caldwell was formally announced as Dungy's successor-in-waiting. On January 12, 2009, Dungy announced his retirement, putting Caldwell in the head coaching position. He was formally introduced at a press conference the following day.\nCaldwell had one of the best debut seasons for a head coach in NFL history, finishing with a 14–2 record. The Colts rushed out to a 14–0 start. With the AFC South title and the top seed in the AFC playoffs secured, Caldwell opted (on orders from then GM, Bill Polian) to sit out his starting players the last two games of the season (both losses), drawing controversy to him and the team. He later won his first playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens on January 16, 2010. On January 24, 2010, Caldwell became the fifth rookie head coach to lead his team to the Super Bowl after securing a 30–17 win against the New York Jets in the AFC Championship Game. On February 7, 2010, Caldwell's rookie season ended with a 31–17 loss in Super Bowl XLIV to the New Orleans Saints.\nCaldwell shares the NFL record for the best start by a rookie head coach, starting his career with 14 wins. George Seifert led the San Francisco 49ers to 14 wins as a rookie head coach in 1989. The 14 wins also tied a Colts franchise record. As of Super Bowl LV, Caldwell is the last rookie head coach to reach the Super Bowl.\nIn his second season the Colts posted a 10–6 record but maintained the division title in the AFC South. They lost their first game in the playoffs to the New York Jets, 17–16, on January 8, 2011, marking the end of the in Indianapolis.\nThe 2011 season, however, saw the Colts sink to 2–14. Starting quarterback Peyton Manning missed the entire season due to undergoing neck surgeries and without him the Colts appeared to be a rudderless team. Caldwell was fired after the season. The league-worst record however, gave the Colts the No. 1 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, which they would end up using to draft Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nThirteen days after his dismissal from the Indianapolis Colts, Caldwell was named quarterbacks coach by the Baltimore Ravens on January 30, 2012. On December 10, 2012, the Ravens dismissed Cam Cameron and named Caldwell the offensive coordinator. On the day after defeating the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game, head coach John Harbaugh announced on January 22, 2013, that Caldwell would be the team's permanent offensive coordinator going into the 2013 season. On February 3, 2013, Caldwell helped lead the Ravens to a 34–31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn January 14, 2014, the Detroit Lions announced Caldwell as their new head coach. He was the first African American to hold the position for the Lions.\nIn Caldwell's first season with the Lions, they posted an 11–5 record and made the playoffs as a wild card. They were defeated in the first round by the Dallas Cowboys, losing by a score of 24–20.\nHalfway through the 2015 season, the Lions had struggled to a 1–7 record, and both team president Tom Lewand and general manager Martin Mayhew were fired. There was speculation that Caldwell would soon be fired as well, but the next week the Lions won a road game against the Green Bay Packers for the first time since 1991. Ultimately, Detroit won 6 of their final 8 games to finish the season with a 7–9 record, and Caldwell retained his job.\nIn 2016, Caldwell's third season in Detroit, the Lions improved to a 9–7 record and lost to the Packers in a Week 17 game that determined the winner of NFC North. The Lions clinched another wild card berth, but lost in the first round to the Seattle Seahawks, 26–6.\nThe Lions went 9–7 again in 2017, in a season widely considered a disappointment despite the Lions' winning record. After the Lions missed the playoffs following a mediocre performance in the second half of the season, there was speculation about Caldwell's future, given the team's performance and belief that Lions general manager Bob Quinn, who was hired during Caldwell's second year, may have wanted to bring in a coach from his former team, the New England Patriots. Subsequently, on January 1, 2018, the day after the season ended, Caldwell was fired by the Lions. He was succeeded by Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia the following month. The firing of Caldwell drew retrospective contention due to the team not improving beyond wild card contention, but regressing under Patricia.\nCaldwell's record as Lions coach was 36–28 (.563), making him the first non-interim Lions coach to leave the team with a winning record since Joe Schmidt, who led the team from 1967 to 1972. His .563 winning percentage was also the best for a Lions' head coach since Buddy Parker in the 1950s.\nXFL.\nAfter being released from Detroit at the end of the 2017 NFL season, Caldwell was hired by the reincarnated XFL to a consulting panel that addressed football rules for the league.\nCaldwell was interviewed in December 2018 by the Green Bay Packers for their open head coach position that was previously held by Mike McCarthy until being let go mid-season in 2018. Caldwell also interviewed for head coaching vacancies with the New York Jets and the Cleveland Browns.\nMiami Dolphins.\nAfter the Miami Dolphins hired Brian Flores as their new head coach, Caldwell was hired to Flores' staff as assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach on February 8, 2019. On July 13, 2019, it was announced Caldwell would take a leave of absence to address health issues, but remained as a consultant. Following the 2019 season, Caldwell was not retained by the Dolphins.\nOn January 4, 2022, Caldwell interviewed to become the next head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. On January 15, he completed an interview for the head coaching job at the Chicago Bears. He was later interviewed for a second time by new general manager Ryan Poles on January 25.\nCaldwell not receiving another head coaching opportunity since 2017, along with his dismissals from the Colts and Lions, were cited by Flores as examples of the league's alleged racial discrimination in his 2022 class-action lawsuit against the NFL.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn January 9, 2023, Caldwell was interviewed as a candidate for the Carolina Panthers' head coach position.\nOn February 14, 2023, Caldwell was named a senior assistant for the Panthers under new head coach Frank Reich.\nFamily.\nCaldwell and his wife, Cheryl, have four children: Jimmy, Jermaine, Jared and Natalie."

        "text": "Tom Moore (born November 7, 1938) is an American football coach and former college player who is an offensive consultant for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). A four-time Super Bowl champion, he spent a majority of his coaching career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts.\nEarly life.\nMoore learned football at an early age in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. He played quarterback at the University of Iowa, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and became a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Moore coached at Iowa after graduation and then joined the Army for two years, when he also coached football overseas.\nCoaching career.\nMoore resumed his college coaching career at the University of Dayton, where he coached offensive backs and received a graduate degree in guidance counseling. When he left Dayton in 1968, Moore went on to coach offense for nine years at Wake Forest University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Minnesota, and for the New York Stars of the World Football League (WFL).\nMoore made the transition to the NFL in 1977 when he joined Chuck Noll's coaching staff at the Pittsburgh Steelers, initially serving as receivers coach. Within three years on the Steelers, Moore earned two Super Bowl rings and in 1983 he was promoted to quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. For eight years, Moore and Tony Dungy, the Colts' head coach from 2002 to 2009, were colleagues on Noll's coaching staff at Pittsburgh.\nLeaving the Steelers in 1990, Moore served in senior offensive coaching roles for three teams in eight years, having the most success as offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions, the team which led the NFL in total offense in 1995 and was the first team in NFL history to have two receivers with over 100 catches in a season (Herman Moore and Brett Perriman).\nIndianapolis Colts.\nMoore interviewed for the Lions' head coaching job in 2006, but the Lions hired Rod Marinelli.\nThe Indianapolis Colts, for whom Moore served as an offensive coordinator since 1998, won Super Bowl XLI in February 2007. Moore coached the offense under head coaches Jim Mora, Dungy and Jim Caldwell. He oversaw the development of quarterback Peyton Manning for Manning's entire tenure with the Colts. Manning started every single game for the Colts over that time period, going 117–59 in the regular season and 9–9 in the playoffs, also setting numerous NFL records, including highest passer rating, season (121.1 in 2004, subsequently surpassed by Aaron Rodgers in 2011) and for most passing touchdowns in a season with 49, also in 2004 (since surpassed by Tom Brady, 50 touchdowns in 2007 and by Manning himself with 55 touchdowns in 2013).\nOn May 6, 2009, ESPN reported that Moore was planning to retire due to a change in the NFL's pension program which affected both him and the Colts' offensive line coach, Howard Mudd. Larry Kennan, the executive director of the NFL Coaches' Association, said Moore had not yet filed his retirement papers but believed that he was \"just about there.\" On May 20, 2009, Moore returned to the Colts to serve as their senior offensive coordinator, though he ultimately left the organization following the 2010 season. On July 21, 2011, it was announced that Moore would take a job with the New York Jets as a remote working offensive consultant.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn January 21, 2013, it was announced Bruce Arians had brought in Tom Moore and to help him overhaul the worst offense in the NFL. Moore served as assistant head coach/offense for the Arizona Cardinals until the end of the 2017 season.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Moore had agreed to be an offensive consultant for the Buccaneers for the 2019 season. Moore reportedly intends to stay with the team for the 2024 season, which would be his 46th season in the NFL. He won his second Super Bowl as a coach and fourth Super Bowl overall when the Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV.\nHonors.\nIn May 2014, Moore was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his 13 seasons as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nIn 2015, Moore was selected as part of the 2015 class for the Paul “Dr. Z” Zimmerman Award by the Pro Football Writers of America. This award is given for lifetime achievements as an assistant coach in the NFL."

        "title": "Mike Smith (American football coach)",
        "text": "Mike Smith (born June 13, 1959) is a former American football coach. He is a former head coach of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, a position he held from 2008 to 2014. He previously served as the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars between 2003 and 2007. During his tenure as the head coach of the Falcons, Smith became the franchise's winningest head coach by number of wins in addition to being the recipient of the 2008 NFL Coach of the Year Award by the Associated Press and was also voted NFL Coach of the Year Award by the Sporting News in 2008, 2010 and 2012.\nEarly years.\nRaised in Daytona Beach, Florida, Smith played linebacker at Father Lopez Catholic High School, earning all-state honors. He played collegiately for East Tennessee State University between 1977 and 1981, and was chosen as defensive MVP twice. He briefly played professionally for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League, for the 1982 season, before retiring as a player.\nCoaching career.\nCollege Coaching.\nSmith decided to take up coaching after his playing days were over, starting in various assistant capacities with several Division I colleges before moving on to the NFL: San Diego State (1982–1985), Morehead State (1986) and Tennessee Tech (1987–1998).\nBaltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars.\nHis first NFL job was as defensive assistant/defensive line coach for the Baltimore Ravens in 1999 under defensive line coach Rex Ryan for three seasons. In 2002, he was promoted to linebackers' coach for head coach Brian Billick, tutoring such future standouts as Ray Lewis, Peter Boulware, Jamie Sharper and Adalius Thomas, and in that capacity helped the 2000 Ravens win Super Bowl XXXV. On January 21, 2003, he was again promoted, moving on to be defensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars for incoming head coach Jack Del Rio.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nIn 2008, Smith became head coach for the first time at any level, taking charge of the Atlanta Falcons and starting off his first season by installing rookie Matt Ryan as starting quarterback to open the season against the Detroit Lions. In his debut as an NFL head coach, his Falcons beat the Lions 34–21. Atlanta's 216 yards of total offense in the first quarter was the highest in over two decades, eclipsing their October 13, 1991 mark of 172 yards against San Francisco. His first loss, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was mitigated by winning his first coach's challenge, on the spotting of the ball after a Roddy White reception in the third quarter, giving the Falcons a first down and keeping the drive alive. Stars like Michael Turner, Roddy White, Michael Jenkins and John Abraham helped him carry the Falcons to their first playoff berth since 2004, although they lost fairly narrowly to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs. He was named the 2008 AP Coach of the year and NFL Coach of the Year, beating out Miami Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano in the voting.\nIn his second season, Smith and the Falcons overcame a difficult schedule and several key injuries (to QB Ryan and RB Turner) to end up with a 9–7 finish and second place in the NFC South. While they failed to reach the playoffs, this marked the first time the team had ever had back-to-back winning seasons.\nIn 2010, he led the Falcons to a NFC-best season record of 13–3, earning the team's second NFC South title and fourth divisional championship overall before being beaten at home by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champions, the Green Bay Packers, 48–21 in the NFC Divisional Round.\nThe 2011 season ended with another winning record (10–6) and Smith's third playoff appearance (a first-round loss, by another eventual Super Bowl champion, the New York Giants).\nIn 2012 Smith led the Falcons to a league best 13–3 record and recorded his first win in the postseason as Falcons head coach, edging the Seattle Seahawks 30–28 in the . With the win, Atlanta also made their 3rd all-time appearance in the NFC Championship Game, and hosted the game for the first time in their history against the San Francisco 49ers. The Falcons were beaten 28–24 after taking the lead 10–0 in the 1st Quarter. Also in the 2012 season, Smith earned his 50th win by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles on October 28, passing Dan Reeves as the best-performing coach in Falcons history by number of wins. Smith reached 50 wins in 71 games, which is good for 3rd-best since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, surpassed only by Chuck Knox who earned his 50th win in 65 games and by George Seifert in 62 games.\nSmith was named \"Sporting News\" 2012 Coach of the Year for the 3rd time by a pool of 27 NFL coaches and executives.\nIn the 2013 season, the Falcons slumped to a 4–12 record, and Smith was eventually named the head coach of the North Team in the 2014 Senior Bowl.\nOn December 28, 2014, multiple media outlets reported that the Falcons had hired Korn Ferry, a reputed firm, to assist in finding potential candidates to replace Smith should he be fired. Later that day, the Falcons lost to the Carolina Panthers 34–3. The game determined the NFC South champion, despite both teams having a losing record. On December 29, 2014, Smith was fired, after two losing seasons in a row.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn January 15, 2016, Smith was named the defensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, under former assistant Dirk Koetter, who was named the Buccaneers' head coach that same day. On October 15, 2018, Smith was fired after leading Tampa Bay to the league's worst defense through the first six weeks of the season.\nHula Bowl.\nIn January 2022, Smith coached Team Aina in the Hula Bowl, a college football postseason all-star game. He returned as head coach of the same squad in 2023.\nPersonal life.\nSmith is the oldest of eight children. Mike and his wife, Julie, have one daughter, Logan. Mike is the brother-in-law of former NFL head coach Brian Billick."

        "text": "The Closing Ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics took place on 26 February 2006 beginning at 20:00 CET () at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin, Italy.\nProgram.\nThe games were formally closed by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge calling them \"magnificent\". This again departed from former IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch's tradition of declaring each games \"best ever\" and continued Rogge's tradition of assigning each games their own identity in his comments.\nMedal ceremony.\nDuring the closing ceremony, in the Olympic Stadium, medals were presented for Cross country skiing at the cross-country skiing men's 50 km free event, one of the last events held at the Games. In a new practice for Winter Olympics closing ceremonies, the medals for this long race were awarded during the ceremony similar to the way the medals for the men's marathon are awarded during the closing ceremonies of Summer Olympic Games.\nGiorgio Di Centa of Italy, the host nation, won the race and was presented with the gold medal. Eugeni Dementiev of Russia was awarded silver, with Austria's Mikhail Botvinov claiming the bronze. The medal presenter was former Olympian and current IOC member Manuela Di Centa, sister of the gold medalist.\n\"Carnevale\".\nThe main theme, to coincide with Italy's popular masked festival, was \"Carnevale\". The show, directed by Daniele Finzi Pasca, who is known internationally for his theatre performances based on the circus world, included six of the original costumes from the film \"I clowns\" by Federico Fellini, on lease from the Italian national film museum. Life-sized Piedmontese tarot cards marching in drill formation signifying all the Luck, Fortune and Life of the Athletes performed to honor every individuals personal story in coming to Torino. The formal moments of the ceremony alternated with artistic moments inspired by the creativity of Viareggio Carnival artists, of travelling shows and of the typical Italian \"feste in piazza\". The original music was composed, arranged and orchestrated by Italian producer Michele Centonze in collaboration with Stefano Nanni, Giuseppe Gambino and Serenella Occhipinti (a.k.a. Sara 6).\nFiat 500s and Vespas drove through the center of the stadium to symbolize the crowded streets of the center of the Italian cities.\nWind machine.\nA wind machine was shown with flying acrobats performing an aerial ballet. This was a vertical wind tunnel that blew the acrobats up into mid-air. The machine was custom-built by Aerodium Canada and Aerodium Latvia for use in the closing ceremony. It is very similar to machines used for indoor skydiving facilities.\nParade of the athletes.\nThe athletes entered the arena without strict order, following a tradition started 50 years earlier at the 1956 Summer Games. They had reportedly been given light-up red clown noses to wear, but few athletes were seen wearing the noses.\nIntruders.\nDuring the final speech by Valentino Castellani, chairman of the Torino Olympic Organizing Committee, was tried to be disrupted by Catalan pitch invader Jaume Marquet i Cot, also known as Jimmy Jump, ran onto the stage and attempted to speak into the microphone. He managed to shout \"Passion lives in Torino\", as well as rip off one of the two microphones on the podium, before security officials quickly wrestled him away. Castellani continued his speech with only a minor pause. Jump T-shirt was printed with the logo of GoldenPalace.com.\nA young Polish female streaker named Justine tried to perform a similar stunt, holding an Italian flag bearing the handwritten inscription \"Mi consenta\", and having a drawing by a Roman artist, Ettore Wallemberg III, on her skin, but security officials stopped her.\nCome Play with Us in Vancouver 2010/Venez jouer avec nous en Vancouver 2010.\nIn accordance with the Olympic Charter which governs the Closing Ceremony, IOC President Jacques Rogge called on the youth of the world to assemble in Vancouver, in four years, for the next Winter Olympics.\nCanadian opera star Ben Heppner, himself born in British Columbia, the host province of the next Winter Olympics, sang \"O Canada\" to begin the Canadian segment of the ceremonies and mark the beginning of the countdown to the Vancouver Olympic Games in 2010. Heppner sang a version of \"O Canada\" which is presented in a combination of Canada's two official languages, English and French, which are also the official languages of the IOC.\nThen came the \"Oslo Ceremony\" (so called because the original Olympic flag, which was used for transfer of the Winter Games, was first used at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo), which is the transfer of the Olympic Flag from the mayor of Turin, Sergio Chiamparino, to Jacques Rogge, and then to the mayor of Vancouver, Sam Sullivan. The flag was kept in the Vancouver City Hall during the next four years. With music playing, Chiamparino ran up the steps to the stage, waved the flag the symbolic eight times, handed it to Rogge, who then handed it to Sullivan. Because Sullivan is a quadriplegic who uses a wheelchair and has limited use of his arms and hands, the flag was placed in a specially-designed flag holder on his chair. Sullivan then spun his chair back and forth eight times to make the flag wave in the air. The assembled crowd roared in approval and rose to their feet in response. This culminated this part of the program. The Olympic flag was next raised again at the next Summer Olympic games in Beijing; opening ceremony there took place on 8 August 2008.\nThe show included a Vancouver-based specially-cast dance corps together with the latest concepts in boarding, skating and skiing. The Montreal-based members of the cast are multi-talented acrobatic performers drawn from Quebec's acclaimed École nationale de cirque (\"National Circus School\"), and Les sept doigts de la main, energetically supported by the renowned Cirque du Soleil. In addition, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne performed her song, \"Who Knows.\"\nIn Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, himself from Calgary, the host city of the 1988 Winter Olympics, said in a statement that the Olympic flame had begun its journey to Vancouver.\nExit of the Olympic Flag.\nAfter the Olympic flag was lowered, Piccoli Cantori di Torino sung Va, pensiero while the flag was exiting the stadium.\nThe siege of Turin.\nAfter Va, pensiero was sung, there was a segment featuring the siege of Turin to commemorate the 300th anniversary.\nMusical finale.\nAndrea Bocelli performed his song \"Because We Believe (Ama Credi E Vai)\" before the flame was extinguished; on stage with Andrea appeared 500 Italian brides in white carrying lighted lilies and formed \"the Dove of Peace\" a formation choreographed by Doug Jack and symbolically \"flew\" across the stage as the flame took its final moments. with the skiier Isolde Kostner acted as the last bride to stay on the stage and when she looked to the cauldron,the Olympic fire had their last moments alive.After the end of the fire last breathed,the singer italian Elisa comes out from the middle of the show cast (she had already sung at the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics) performed their hit song \"Luce (Tramonti a nord est)\", and Puerto Rican Ricky Martin performed \"I Don't Care\" and \"The Cup of Life\".\nNotable attendees.\nAside from celebrities participating in the ceremonies and members of the International Olympic Committee, the following notable people were in attendance:\nTelevision broadcast.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the ceremony on tape delay, starting at 7:00 pm EST and PST/6:00 pm CST and MST, and it was one of the broadcasters that did not edit out the intruders interrupting the speeches.\nIn Canada, CBC and CBC Newsworld broadcasts the ceremony live, starting at 1:00 pm EST, with several replays on both networks throughout the day.\nIn the UK, the BBC broadcasts the ceremony live, starting at 7:00 pm GMT.\nIn Australia, the Seven Network broadcasts the ceremony live, starting at 5.30 am AEST.\nIn Spain, TVE2 broadcast the ceremony.\nIn Italy, RAI broadcasts the ceremony live at the same time it start started."

        "text": "The Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium (SBNCS; ), also called Mirpur Stadium, is an International cricket ground at Mirpur, in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Located 10 kilometres from Mirpur city centre, the ground holds approximately 25,000 people and is named after the Bengali statesman A. K. Fazlul Huq, who was accorded the title \"Sher-e-Bangla\" (\"Tiger of Bengal\").\nHistory.\nThe ground was originally constructed for football in the late 1980s and first hosted matches at the 1987 Asian Club Championship and 1988–89 Asian Club Championship. The venue was taken over by the Bangladesh Cricket Board in 2004, replacing the Bangabandhu National Stadium as the home of both the men's and women's national teams. The stadium has field dimensions of 186 m × 136 m.\nThe first international match at the redeveloped ground was held in December 2006, and the stadium has since hosted matches of the 2011 World Cup, 2012 and 2014 Asia Cup, 2016 Asia Cup along with the majority of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) matches. The finals of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and Women's World Twenty20 were hosted at the stadium. The stadium hosted its first International T20 on 11 October 2011, Bangladesh vs West Indies.\nOn 17 January 2018, during the 2017–18 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series, it became the sixth and fastest to host 100 ODIs.\nFor the 2019–20 Bangabandhu BPL Final, 27,725 people gathered at this venue, the highest crowd attendance for the venue and beyond its official capacity.\nOn 3 March 2023, during the 2nd ODI between Bangladesh and England, the venue hosted its 200th men's international match which was also the 100th ODI match played by Bangladesh men's cricket team at this venue.\nDuring the one-off test between Bangladesh and Afghanistan from 14–18 June 2023, when Baangladesh's Najmul Hossain Shanto scored a century in their first innings, it was the 100th century at this venue combining all three international format.\nFacilities.\nThe ground was originally built for football and athletics, and was hence rectangular in shape. To restore it to a shape suitable for cricket, a lot of renovation had to be done, and the athletics tracks had to be dug up. About three feet of soil was excavated to remove the red clay. PVC pipes were fitted before re-filling with rock chips and sand, and then grass. The slope is even, a difference of 29 inches from the wicket to the boundary. The ground was fitted with floodlights in 2009 and is able to host day/night cricket matches.\nFirst Test, ODI and T20I.\nThe ground hosted its first Test match on 25 May 2007, when the home team played India. The first ODI took place on 8 December 2006, when Bangladesh played Zimbabwe. On 11 October 2011, the stadium hosted its first T20I, between Bangladesh and West Indies.\nBPL.\nTill 2019-20 BPL, the venue has hosted most of the matches (198) including all Playoff matches and Finals.\n2011 World Cup.\nThe stadium hosted 4 Group matches and 2 Quarter Finals during the 2011 Cricket World Cup which took place in 19 February – 2 April, jointly hosted by Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. The other venue in Bangladesh was Chittagong.\nRenovations.\nPrior to the tournament, the stadium has undergone radical renovations. A giant screen and an electronic scoreboard had been installed, the traditional sight-screens have been replaced with electronic ones, the floodlights have been improved, a hover cover has been bought from the UK for about $16,000, plastic seats have been installed for the whole ground, a new media center has been built which accommodates about 200 journalists and the dressing rooms have also been given a makeover. Also adjacent to the main ground, a new Cricket Academy has been formed and with it came a whole new training ground, adding to the already existing indoor training facility."

He spent his entire ten-year career with the Bears, and is the franchise's all-time leader in receiving yards with 5,059. He attended the Santa Barbara College (now University of California, Santa Barbara). Morris won an NFL championship in 1963. In 1964, he had his best season with 93 receptions for 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns.\nSportscaster career.\nIn 1964, while still playing for the Bears, Morris joined WBBM-TV in Chicago as a sportscaster. Except for a six-year stint at rival WMAQ-TV, Morris remained at WBBM until 1992, serving for most of that time as sports director. He became good friends with film critic Gene Siskel when Siskel was hired by the station in the 1970s. During his time at WBBM-TV, he popularised the use of the telestrator (a device for drawing over still or moving video images) in sports television, which was invented by fellow WBBM-TV employee Leonard Reiffel for his science-related TV series \"Dimensions on Tomorrow's Living\" and \"The World Tomorrow\". He also served as a football color commentator for CBS' NFL coverage from 1975 to 1986. He retired in 1996.\nPersonal life.\nHis father was from Achladokampos, Greece (family name Μονοπορης, or Monoporis), while his mother was Swedish. While playing for the Bears, Morris was known as \"Little Greek\" and teammate Bill George was \"Big Greek\".\nMorris was married to sports reporter Jeannie Morris, whom he met at UC Santa Barbara, from 1960 to 1985. The two remained close after their divorce as television colleagues. Jeannie died December 14, 2020."

        "title": "2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal",
        "text": "At the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, allegations arose that the pairs' figure skating competition had been fixed. The controversy led to two pairs teams receiving gold medals: the original winners Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia and original silver-medalists Jamie Salé and David Pelletier of Canada. The scandal was one of the causes for the revamp of scoring in figure skating to the new ISU Judging System.\nCompetition.\nIn the figure skating pairs competition, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia won the short program over Jamie Salé and David Pelletier of Canada. During the short program, Salé and Pelletier had tripped and fallen on their closing pose. Because the fall was not on an element, it did not receive a deduction, but it marred the program enough to land the pair in second place behind Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze.\nIn the free skate, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze made a minor, yet obvious, technical error when Sikharulidze stepped out of a double Axel. Salé and Pelletier performed a free skate program to \"Love Story\" which they had used in previous seasons and that had been well received at the Grand Prix Final before the Olympics. They skated a flawless program, albeit one that some experts considered to be of lesser difficulty than that of the Russians. \nBased on the 6.0 system of scoring in use, Salé and Pelletier received 5.9s and 5.8s for technical merit, while the Russians had received mostly 5.8s and 5.7s. However, the Canadians received only four 5.9s for presentation, versus the Russians' seven. Presentation was weighted in the total score more strongly than technical merit, so the Canadians had needed at least five 5.9s in presentation to overtake the Russians for first. Since they did not receive that many, the Canadians were ranked second, and Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze took the gold.\nScandal.\nDuring the live broadcast, both the American and Canadian television commentators (NBC Sports' Tom Hammond, Scott Hamilton, and Sandra Bezic and CBC Sports' Chris Cuthbert, Paul Martini, and Barbara Underhill) proclaimed that Salé and Pelletier had won the gold as they finished their program, believing their performances to be superior to the Russians. Subsequently, they expressed outrage when the judges' marks were announced. Suspicions were rapidly raised of cheating in the scoring. Judges from Russia, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Ukraine, and France had placed the Russians first; judges from the United States, Canada, Germany, and Japan chose the Canadians.\nThe French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, quickly attracted suspicion. When Le Gougne returned to the officials' hotel, Sally Stapleford, chair of the International Skating Union's Technical Committee, confronted her. Le Gougne was upset and allegedly said that she had been pressured by Didier Gailhaguet, the head of the French national skating federation, to vote for the Russian pair regardless of how the others performed. She reportedly repeated this at the post-event judges' meeting the next day. It was alleged that this was part of a deal to get an advantage for the French team of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat in the ice dance competition that was to follow a few days later. Le Gougne later submitted a signed statement in which she denied taking part in such a deal, and also said that she had truly believed the Russian pair deserved to win the gold.\nImmediate aftermath.\nThe Canadian press and public were outraged by the result. The American press were also quick to support the Canadian pair. NBC, in particular, continued to report on the story and support the Canadians' cause. Some in the United States and many in Russia, however, felt that Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had deserved their win, and that it should not be marred by the alleged dishonesty of a single judge. Sikharulidze contrasted these events to the reactions to Salé and Pelletier's win at the 2001 World Championships, held in Canada. The Canadians were awarded gold despite Salé falling on the triple toe loop in the short program and changing her planned double Axel to a single Axel in the long program. Points were deducted for both errors.\nIn response to Canadian and American outcry, International Skating Union (ISU) President Ottavio Cinquanta announced in a press conference a day after the competition that the ISU would conduct an \"internal assessment\" into the judging decision at its next scheduled council meeting. After many hostile questions from the press, Cinquanta acknowledged that the event referee, Ronald Pfenning, had filed an official complaint about the judging. Later, on February 13, International Olympic Committee (IOC) Director-General François Carrard held a press conference in which he publicly urged the ISU to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.\nOn February 15, Cinquanta and IOC President Jacques Rogge, in a joint press conference, announced that Salé and Pelletier's silver medals would be upgraded to gold. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze were to keep their gold medals as well, since there was no evidence of wrongdoing on their part. Four of the nine judges on the panel felt they deserved it. Both pairs' point totals were thrown out. For the first time in history, the awards ceremony was repeated. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze attended, but the bronze medalists, Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China, refused. \nPost-Olympics aftermath.\nOn April 30, 2002, the ISU announced that Le Gougne and Gailhaguet were suspended for three years for their roles in the scandal and also prohibited from attending the 2006 Winter Olympics. Although at least one eye-witness to Le Gougne's outburst in the hotel lobby reported that she had specifically confessed to a deal with the Russians, Cinquanta claimed there was no evidence that the Russians were involved in the incident. On July 31, 2002, Italian authorities in Venice arrested organized crime boss Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov on U.S. charges that he masterminded the fix at the Olympics. He was released from Italian police custody without being charged, amidst attempts to have him extradited to the United States in 2002–2003.\nIn 2004, the ISU voted to change the 6.0 judging system because it was considered to be too subjective. As a result, the International Judging System (IJS) was created to score a skater based on the technological grade of execution of the elements and gives a true numerical, mathematical score. In addition to disciplining Le Gougne and Gailhaguet, the ISU adopted a policy of secret judging as part of a new system for figure skating. Judges' marks are posted anonymously, as part of the new ISU Judging System for figure skating. While the ISU claimed this secrecy freed judges from pressure from their federations, critics noted that, instead of preventing judges from cheating, secrecy prevented the public and media from being able to identify cheating. Following the 2014 Sochi Olympics, the ISU Congress changed this policy, and ended anonymous judging to \"increase transparency\" in the process.\nIn March 2003, a group of skating officials who were unhappy with the ISU's leadership and handling of the crisis in the sport announced the formation of the World Skating Federation. Their attempt to take control of competitive figure skating away from the ISU failed. TSU or their respective national federations banished several of the persons involved with establishing the new federation from the sport of ice skating. Those banned included Ronald Pfenning, referee of the pairs competition at the Salt Lake City Olympics; Sally Stapleford; Jon Jackson; and other witnesses to Le Gougne's outburst.\nDocumentary.\nIn 2021, one of the episodes of Netflix documentary series \"Bad Sport\" showcases this controversial event. In early 2022, former skater Tara Lipinski and her husband Todd Kapostasy (a producer of sports documentaries) were co-producers of the 4-part docu-series titled \"Meddling\", which studied the 2002 skating controversy at the Salt Lake City Olympics. It was broadcast on NBC subsidiaries."

He also played several years in different minor leagues, retiring in 1936. He is notable for being the first NHL player to sit out a season over a contract dispute.\nPlaying career.\nNicknamed \"Jumpin' Jackie\", Forbes was involved in the infamous 1925 Hamilton Tigers players' strike. Before becoming involved in the players strike, Forbes played for the Toronto St. Patricks and sat out the entire 1921–22 NHL season while holding out for a $2500 salary. In doing so, Forbes became the first NHL player to sit out an entire season due to a contract dispute. His contract was then sold to Hamilton after the season ended. He spent most of his career with the Hamilton Tigers/New York Americans franchise. After getting into two playoff games in 1921, his first full season, he never played another post-season game despite not retiring from the league for another twelve years. His only other opportunity at winning a Stanley Cup was foiled by the Hamilton players strike. In his NHL career, he finished with 84 wins, 114 losses and 11 ties, with a 2.76 goals against average (GAA).\nHe was the last surviving former player of the Hamilton Tigers."

On March 11, 1955, at the IV Pan American Congress in Mexico City, PASO selected Cleveland unanimously to host the III Pan American Games.\nOn April 15, 1957, Cleveland asked PASO to be relieved of their assignment as the host city. Subsequently, both Guatemala City and Rio de Janeiro informed PASO that they would not be able to host the games either. Two cities came forward as candidates host the games, Chicago and São Paulo, and on August 3, 1957, Chicago was selected over São Paulo by a vote of 13 to 6.\nOrganization.\nOnce Chicago took over the game following Cleveland's withdrawal, there were 18 months left to organize the games. The games were held on-schedule nonetheless. The games were the first Pan American Games to be held during the Northern Hemisphere summer. The previous two editions were held in March.\nIn the months following the awarding of the Games to Chicago, PASO leadership became seriously concerned that Chicago's preparations for the event were insufficient. Particularly, they felt that the event's director, Colonel Jack Reilly, was treating the Games as an ordinary Chicago event rather than an international competition on par with the Olympics. In the summer of 1958, PASO honorary president Avery Brundage privately said that the Chicago organizers \"haven't the faintest idea of the magnitude of the task they have assumed\" and predicted that the Games would be \"the most dismal fiasco in the history of international sport\". Publicly, he warned that \"unless greater effort is put forth to prepare for the 1959 Pan American Games, both the city and the nation may be disgraced in the eyes of the world\". PASO considered cancelling the Games entirely before Chicago's organizing committee was reorganized and Reilly was replaced.\nThe Games.\nThe Games opened on August 27, 1959, in sunny 90 °F (32 °C) heat before 40,000 people at Soldier Field. The opening ceremony was preceded by a monthlong torch relay from Mexico City to Chicago. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was expected to attend the opening ceremony, but he canceled his appearance in favor of a diplomatic trip to Europe. Eisenhower's brother Milton attended the ceremony in his place.\nThe event was marred by numerous organizational failures and poor-quality facilities. For some sports, such as shooting, no practice facilities were provided at all. Manuel Gonzalez Guerra, who later became president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, referred to the 1959 Games as \"the worst ever,\" and his comments were in line with the negative perceptions of many other Latin Americans who traveled to Chicago for the Games.\nMale athletes were housed in dormitories at the University of Chicago, the Ferry Hall School, and North Central College, while female athletes stayed at the Shoreland Hotel. On September 7, hours before the closing ceremony, Brazilian rower Ronaldo Duncan Arantes was found dead of bullet wounds at North Central College. Arantes' brother Rômulo, a fellow athlete at the Games, reported that Ronaldo had brought money to Chicago with him to purchase firearms. No one was ever charged in Arantes' death."

(One source put the number of competing athletes at 4,000.)\nHost city selection.\nThree cities submitted bids to host the 1971 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization. On July 22, 1967, Cali was selected over Santiago and Champ, Missouri by a vote of 12 to 11 to 6, respectively, by PASO at its general assembly, held at the Manitoba Medical College in Winnipeg, Canada, to host the VI Pan American Games.\nVenues.\nThe main stadium was the Cali Olympic Stadium. Some events were held in the Coliseo El Pueblo. Boxing was staged in the Plaza de Toros Cañaveralejo, a Cali bullring. Some complaints were made about the barracks-style housing, which was woefully overcrowded. In an effort to protect the athletes from students who had protested the amount of money that Colombia was spending on the games, security-minded officials surrounded the athletes' village with barbed wire and guards carrying rifles. The overcrowding caused it to be dubbed \"Claustrophobia Manor\" by the athletes. Other concerns centered on mosquitoes, the altitude, faulty plumbing, dysentery and pickpockets.\nMedal count.\n\"To sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the icon next to the column title.\""

        "title": "Eddie Johnson (basketball, born 1955)",
        "text": "Edward Lee Johnson Jr. (February 24, 1955 – October 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. He played 10 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) – mainly as a member of the Atlanta Hawks – from 1977 to 1987. Johnson was a two-time NBA-All-Star with the Hawks in 1980 and 1981, and earned two nominations to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 1979 and 1980. He was nicknamed \"Fast Eddie\" for his speed and quickness on the court.\nJohnson's notorious off-court behaviour due to drug abuse harmed his reputation as a player. He was traded by the Hawks to the Cleveland Cavaliers for the end of the 1985–86 season. He played for the Tampa Bay Thrillers in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) during the 1986–87 season in an attempt to return to the NBA and received a mid-season call-up to play for the Seattle SuperSonics in what would be his final professional stint. Johnson's playing career ended when he received a suspension by the NBA due to a cocaine addiction in 1987. His life after basketball delved further into criminal activities and culminated in Johnson being sentenced to life in prison for sex crimes on a minor in 2008. He died of an undisclosed illness while serving his sentence.\nEarly life and college career.\nJohnson was born in Ocala, Florida, and raised in Weirsdale, Florida, as the oldest of five children. His father worked as a laborer. Johnson played basketball with a homemade goal outside his family's house. He was one of the first black students to attend a previously all-white grade school in Weirsdale. He attended Lake Weir High School and started all four years he played. Johnson graduated from Lake Weir as one of the top students in his class.\nJohnson played college basketball for the Auburn Tigers from 1973 to 1977. He led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring as a freshman with 21.8 points per game. Johnson led the Tigers in scoring and assists for his first three seasons, and was nominated to the All-SEC Coaches' first-team from 1974 to 1976. He allegedly had conflicts with Tigers coach Bob Davis who accused Johnson of having \"a bad attitude\". Johnson's scoring average dipped each season with the Tigers and caused worry amongst professional scouts as to if he was a problematic player.\nProfessional career.\nJohnson was selected by the Atlanta Hawks as the 49th overall pick of the 1977 NBA draft. Averaging 10.5 points, the rookie helped the Hawks return to the playoffs after a four-year absence, a feat repeated in six of Johnson's eight full years with the club.\nJohnson became a starter in 1978–79. During that season, Johnson advanced as far as he ever would in pursuit of an NBA championship, losing in the conference semifinals to the Washington Bullets. He was a starter four consecutive seasons, averaging at least 16 points each season. Fans voted Johnson into a starting spot in the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, where he scored 22 points on 11-of-16 shooting. He returned as a starter in the 1981 NBA All-Star Game, where he scored 16 points on 7-of-12 shooting.\nJohnson was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Johnny Davis during the 1985–86 NBA season. He considered his year with the Cavaliers to be \"a waste.\" Johnson played in the Continental Basketball Association for the Tampa Bay Thrillers during the 1986–87 season as he needed visibility to work his way back into the NBA. He averaged 22 points, 2.5 rebounds and 4.0 assists in 26 games played with the Thrillers. Johnson was named the CBA Newcomer of the Year and nominated to the All-CBA First Team.\nJohnson signed a contract with the Seattle SuperSonics as they needed an experienced guard for the end of the 1986–87 NBA season. SuperSonics coach Bernie Bickerstaff had a closed-door meeting with his players before Johnson was signed while the team assigned someone to monitor Johnson's activities due to their wariness of his volatility.\nJohnson was considered a desirable person during the NBA season who went out of control during offseasons. Pat Williams, who was then general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, stated: \"Eddie became a time bomb every summer.\" Johnson battled a cocaine addiction throughout his career. After several suspensions, he finally checked himself into rehab in 1986. After he failed to follow through on mandatory counseling, the NBA suspended him in 1987, with Johnson never returning to play again afterward.\nJohnson averaged 15.1 points per game in 675 games played during his 10-year NBA career.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson's younger brother, Frank, is a former player and coach in the NBA. He was a distant cousin of fellow basketball player Tree Rollins, who was his teammate on the Hawks.\nJohnson had three children.\nOff-court issues and imprisonment.\nJohnson first began using cocaine as a college student. He passed out during a celebratory function at Auburn in 1979 in what was the first public indication of his drug habits. Johnson denied that his drug habits led to his personal issues and stated: \"The whole idea of me abusing drugs is outlandish.\"\nDuring the 1980 NBA off-season, Johnson escaped unharmed after he jumped off a second-story apartment balcony and fled across a parking lot while two men fired gunshots at him in what police believed was part of a drug dispute. Three weeks later, he was arrested for possession of cocaine while driving a rental car in Atlanta but the charges were dropped because the police's search of the car was deemed illegal. Johnson was taken to a private psychiatric facility in Cobb County, Georgia, and underwent therapy for almost a week. The day after Johnson checked himself out of the facility, he was arrested for stealing a car from a car dealer but the charges were again dropped.\nJohnson was diagnosed with manic depression by psychiatrists in the Cobb County facility; he doubted the accuracy of the diagnosis. He was prescribed with lithium tablets that he stopped taking during the 1980–81 NBA season without the knowledge of the Hawks team. Johnson believed that he no longer needed the medication and that it contributed to his tiredness during games. The Hawks became aware of the resumption of Johnson's erratic behavior in July 1981 and persuaded him to submit to a local hospital. Johnson showed up at the Hawks' training camp in October directly from the hospital and became increasingly disruptive as he rebuked teammates, left the floor to play with a child in the stands, and jumped rope on the sidelines while oblivious to his surroundings during practice sessions. After being so alarmed by his actions, Atlanta Hawks President Michael Gearon and General Manager Stan Kasten contacted Johnson's psychiatrist, who signed a commitment order to have Johnson placed in Grady Memorial Hospital. Johnson was picked up by police before a planned practice session and taken to Grady. Johnson was taken off the Hawks' suspended list on November 21, 1981.\nJohnson's life continued to spiral out of control following his banishment from the NBA. He was arrested and convicted for a litany of crimes over the years, including burglary, battery, robbery, drug possession, assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. He admitted that he had frequent drug problems which had initially cost him his career. Johnson's rap sheet numbered about 100 arrests and five stints in and out of the Florida prison system when in 2006, he was arrested for sexually assaulting an 8-year-old girl in her home at Parkside Garden Apartments in Ocala, Florida. The arrest created additional controversy when multiple publications used the picture of another NBA player named Eddie Johnson, who believed his reputation had been damaged due to the incident.\nOn October 30, 2008, Johnson was convicted of sexual battery of a minor, lewd and lascivious molestation of a minor, and trespassing for the sexual assault of the 8-year-old girl. Johnson denied doing anything inappropriate. The sex crimes carried a mandatory life sentence without parole. Johnson was incarcerated at Santa Rosa Correctional Institution.\nDeath.\nJohnson died on October 26, 2020, of an undisclosed illness in Milton, Florida. His death was confirmed on November 3, 2020."

        "text": "The men's tournament in ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics was held in Turin, Italy, from 15 to 26 February. Twelve teams competed, with Sweden winning the gold medal, Finland winning silver, and the Czech Republic winning bronze. It was the third Olympic tournament to feature National Hockey League (NHL) players and the tenth best-on-best hockey tournament in history. United States defenseman Chris Chelios set a standard for longest time between his first Olympic ice hockey tournament and his last—he had competed twenty-two years earlier at the 1984 Olympics. The old record was set by Swiss hockey player Bibi Torriani. who had played twenty years after his debut (1928 and 1948).\nThe tournament format was changed from the 1998 and 2002 tournaments to a format similar to the 1992 and 1994 tournaments. The number of teams was reduced from 14 to 12, which were split into two groups in the preliminary stage (which followed a round robin format). Each team played the other teams in their group once. The top four teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals.\nThe tournament is also notable for the lacklustre performance of defending champion Canada, which lost two group stage games (including a shock defeat to Switzerland) before being eliminated by Russia in the quarter-finals. There were allegations that Sweden intentionally lost their final group game against Slovakia to set up a quarterfinal against Switzerland.\nIn the semi-finals, Sweden defeated the Czech Republic 7–3, and Finland ousted Russia 4–0. Sweden won its second ice hockey gold, and first in a best-on-best competition, over Finland 3–2 and the Czech Republic won the bronze medal over Russia 3–0. Three months later, Sweden won the 2006 World Championships and became the first team to win the Olympic and World Championship gold in the same year.\nQualification.\nCanada, Sweden, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Finland, United States, Russia and Germany qualified as the top eight teams in the IIHF World Ranking in 2004.

Shortly before the game, Sweden coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson was reported to have publicly contemplated tanking in order to avoid those teams, saying about Canada and the Czechs, \"One is cholera, the other the plague.\" During the game itself, one reportedly suspect sequence came when Sweden had an extended five-on-three powerplay with five NHL stars on the ice—Peter Forsberg, Mats Sundin, Daniel Alfredsson, Nicklas Lidström and Fredrik Modin—and failed to put a shot on net. Sports Illustrated writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, \"If the Swedes had passed the puck any more, their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals.\" \"[They] were even afraid to shoot!\", Russian coach Vladimir Krikunov said.\nAs part of a subsequent interview about the championship over five years later, Forsberg was interpreted to insinuate that Sweden lost their preliminary round game against Slovakia on purpose, so as to draw Switzerland as their quarterfinal opponent, rather than Canada or the Czech Republic. Swedish forward Henrik Sedin, who played alongside Forsberg on the 2006 team denied the notion while adding that Forsberg's comments in the interview were misconstrued.\n&lt;section begin=B15 /&gt;&lt;section end=B15 /&gt;\nPlayoff round.\nQuarterfinals.\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C3 /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C4 /&gt;&lt;section end=C4 /&gt;\nSemifinals.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\nBronze medal game.\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\nGold medal game.\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam USA was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 31 years and 8 months.

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2000 followed the system in use since 1995. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and \nelected two: Carlton Fisk and Tony Pérez. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and selected three people from multiple classified ballots: Sparky Anderson, Bid McPhee, and Turkey Stearnes.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were held July 23 with George Grande as master of ceremonies.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1980 or later but not after 1994 (final game, 1980 to 1994). The ballot comprised 30 candidates, 16 returning from the 1999 ballot, where they received at least 5% support, and 14 on the ballot for the first time (†), chosen by a screening committee from players who last appeared in 1994. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to participate by voting for as many as 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots returned would be honored with induction to the Hall.\nResults were announced on January 11, 2000. A total of 499 ballots were returned so 375 votes were required for election. A total of 2813 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.64 per ballot. Candidates who received less than 5% support, or 25 votes, would not appear on future BBWAA ballots (*). They were also eliminated from future consideration by the Veterans Committee of the time, but that possibility was restored by new arrangements passed in 2001 and eligibility for the Veterans Committee ballot remains unrelated to performance in BBWAA elections after subsequent reforms.\nTwo players were elected and 15 with final games played during 1981–94 were forwarded to next year.\nThe newly-eligible players included 16 All-Stars, three who were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 43 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 9-time All-Star Goose Gossage and 5-time All-Stars Steve Sax and Jack Morris. The field included two Rookies of the Year (Sax and Rick Sutcliffe) and two Cy Young Award winners (Sutcliffe and Bob Welch).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Larry Andersen, Daryl Boston, Sid Bream, Tom Brunansky, Storm Davis, Steve Farr, Mike Felder, Joe Hesketh, Jay Howell, Mike Jeffcoat, Tim Leary, Craig Lefferts, Kevin McReynolds, Bob Melvin, Edwin Núñez, Bob Ojeda, Junior Ortiz, Dan Pasqua, Gary Redus, and Harold Reynolds.\nThe Veterans Committee.\nThe Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the categories considered in all its meetings since 1953.\nThe older players eligible were those with ten major league seasons beginning 1945 or earlier; those who received at least 100 votes from the BBWAA in some election up to 1990; and those who received at least 60% support in some election beginning 1991. Players on Major League Baseball's ineligible list were also ineligible for election.\nBy an arrangement since 1995 the committee separately considered candidates from the Negro leagues and from the 19th century with authority to select one from each of those two special ballots.\nIt elected three people, one fewer than the maximum number permitted: manager Sparky Anderson from the 1970s, center fielder Turkey Stearnes from the Negro leagues, and second baseman Bid McPhee from the 19th century.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nHal Lebovitz received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 1999 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 1999, and conferred in the summer 2000 ceremonies.)\nFord C. Frick Award.\nMarty Brennaman received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster."

        "text": "The 1999 Pan American Games, officially the XIII Pan American Games or the 13th Pan American Games, was a major international multi-sport event that was held from July 23 to August 8, 1999, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and surrounding towns and cities. Canoeing competitions started the day before the games officially began. Approximately 5,000 athletes from 42 nations participated in the games to vie for a total of 330 medal events in 34 sports and 42 disciplines.\nFinancially, the 1999 games were a success, generating a surplus of $8.9 million through a combination of fiscal restraint and the contribution of nearly 20,000 volunteers.\nThe 1999 Pan American Games were the second Pan American Games hosted by Canada and Winnipeg. Previously, Winnipeg hosted the 1967 Pan American Games.\nBidding process.\nWinnipeg beat both Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and Bogotá, Colombia in 1994 to win hosting rights for the event.\nIn 1988, a delegation from Winnipeg announced that once it got approval from the Canadian Olympic Association, the city would submit a bid to host the 1999 Pan American Games. On December 5, 1992, Winnipeg secured the Canadian bidding rights, defeating Toronto by one vote. Other Canadian cities in the running were Halifax, Edmonton, and Sherbrooke. Toronto would later go on to host the 2015 Pan American Games, 16 years later.\nAny country that had previously held the games were allotted two votes; those countries were Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, United States and Venezuela, making 50 votes in total, and a city needed majority vote (26) to win. Canada and Colombia were not allowed to vote, as they each had a city making a bid.\nAfter the first round of voting, Bogotá was eliminated having the fewest voting with 10 votes. In the second round, Winnipeg and Santo Domingo reached a 25-to-25 tie. Canadian Bidding Committee Co-Chairman Don Mackenzie managed to convince delegates from three National Olympic Committees to change their votes before the tiebreaker round, focusing on the fact that \"Santo Domingo had no place for water-skiing, but Portage la Prairie has one of the best water-skiing facilities in Canada.\" Winnipeg went on to defeat Santo Domingo by a vote of 28 to 22. Santo Domingo later won the rights to the next games in 2003.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nVenues.\nA total of 32 sporting venues were used for the games. The Pan Am Pool, built for the 1967 games, featured in the 1999 games for all aquatic events. The venue underwent a $3.3 million dollar renovation for the games. Other new venues included the $8.7 million dollar Investors Group Athletic Centre built for multiple sports and the $12 million dollar CanWest Global Park for the baseball competition.\nThe main stadium for the games was the Winnipeg Stadium, which staged the ceremonies and the beach volleyball competitions.\nA portion of the Pan American Games Society (PANAM'99) budget supported the refurbishment of University of Manitoba residences to serve as the Athletes Village, the upgrade of various sport and training facilities including the Pan Am Stadium (University Stadium), which had hosted events of the 1967 games.\nThe Winnipeg Velodrome, also built for the 1967 games, had become obsolete and disused for cycling and so was demolished prior to the 1999 games. The cycling venue was a temporary facility at Red Rived Exhibition Park.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the 1999 Pan American Games took place on Friday July 23, 1999, beginning at 19:30 p.m. CDT and lasted for two hours and forty-five minutes at the Winnipeg Stadium. A crowd of 30,000 spectators attended the ceremony. Seven Aboriginal Canadians, who were denied entrance into the 1967 Pan American Games, also in Winnipeg, this time entered the stadium with the torch while on canoes. Former Olympians Alwyn Morris and Silken Laumann were the final two torchbearers who lit the cauldron. A total of 3,400 performers took part in the ceremony, including the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and singer Jeremy Kushnier. Singer Chantal Kreviazuk sang the national anthem, O Canada as part of the ceremony. Governor General Roméo LeBlanc officially opened the games. One of the dignitaries in attendance was Anne, Princess Royal.\nParticipating teams.\nAll 42 nations of PASO competed.\nSports.\n330 events in 34 sports were contested. Beach volleyball and inline hockey made its Pan American Games debut. While a women's tournaments in football and water polo were held for the first time.\n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each sport.\" \nImpact of positive doping results.\nPerhaps the greatest drug scandal in the sport of track and field, since Ben Johnson disqualification at the 1988 Summer Olympics, occurred here when Javier Sotomayor the current high jump world record holder tested positive for cocaine. A Cuban national hero, his subsequent suspension was fought from the highest levels, Fidel Castro claiming it was a conspiracy. Despite a second positive test for cocaine a few months later, Sotomayor eventually had his suspension reduced by a year, just in time to win the silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. A year later he retired, when he faced another positive drug test.\nCanada was stripped of its gold medal for inline hockey when the team's goaltender Steve Vézina tested positive for multiple banned substances.\nMedal count.\n\"To sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the icon next to the column title.\"\nMarketing.\nMascots.\nThe 1999 Games' mascot features two birds named \"Pato\" (Wood duck) and \"Lorita\" (Parrot).\nLegacy.\nThe 1999 Pan Am games have been \"seen by many Winnipeggers as a chance to put their city squarely in the international spotlight\". Winnipeg mayor Glen Murray became nationally well known as a result of the Games and thanks to extensive coverage by the CBC, anchored by CBC Sports' Brian Williams. However, the Games themselves only had mixed success, as the Pan Am Games ranked below the Olympics and Commonwealth Games in international prestige. The Games cost $129 million CDN and finished with a financial surplus of $8.8 million CDN.\nHosts Canada celebrated its medal haul, which was the second best after the United States. However, some considered Canada's results overrated, since the U.S. amassed the most medals with a mostly second-string team while Canada and Cuba had fielded their top national athletes. Cuba also managed more golds than Canada, despite having a smaller roster.\nFrequent comparisons were made to the 1967 Pan Am Games, also hosted by Winnipeg, where the United States had fielded many rising stars, such as Mark Spitz. By comparison, the Americans had sent their \"B\" team to the 1999 Games. No major U.S. networks covered the Pan Am Games, except for the Spanish-language network Univisión, while newspapers only sent second-string reporters instead and the stories never made front page news. Many high-profile athletes, of all nationalities, such as U.S. champion sprinters and Brazilian football players, were in Europe during these Pan Am games, taking part in professional events. South American nations (with the exception of Uruguay) did not send their under-23 male soccer teams after the organizing committee refused to pay appearance money to CONMEBOL.\n1999 Parapan American Games, Mexico City.\nIn 1999, Parapan American Games was not hosted in Winnipeg but rather in Mexico City. The inaugural event involved 1,000 athletes from 18 countries competing in four sports."

        "text": "The 2003 Pan American Games were held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, from August 1 to 17, 2003. The successful bid for the Games was made in the mid-1990s, when Dominican Republic had one of the highest growth rates in Latin America.\nAll 42 PASO countries and over 5,223 athletes pre-registered for participation in the XIV Pan American Games. An additional 2,425 trainers and delegates attended. The United States pre-registered the most athletes (713) and Saint Lucia entered the least (6). The host country entered 562 athletes.\nBids.\nIn December 1998, in Panama City, Panama, Santo Domingo beat Guadalajara, Mexico, and Medellín, Colombia, in the voting to host the Games. Guadalajara went on to host the 2011 Pan American Games.\nGames highlights.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe games opened at Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez before a crowd of 48,000. The exhibition featured some 10,000 performers, some dressed in costumes ranging from skeletons to men in tuxedoes and top hats, typifying a Dominican carnival.\nLocal baseball heroes Juan Marichal and Pedro Martínez were on hand for the ceremony. They completed the final lap of the torch and with Luis Pujols, the nephew of the San Francisco Giants coach of the same name, dressed in a Dominican baseball uniform, swung a bat at a baseball sitting atop the mini-flame which triggered the cauldron.\nThe ceremony also was attended by then-President of the Dominican Republic Hipólito Mejía, Pan American Sports Organization president Mario Vázquez Raña and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nBudget and venues.\nThe Dominican Republic spent at least $175 million for the 17-day sporting event. Two Olympic parks were renewed or built, the Centro Olímpico Juan Pablo Duarte and Parque del Este complex. Laborers were forced to work right up until the opening ceremony because of construction delays, electrical blackouts, and questionable venue quality. In the end, the Dominican Republic refurbished existing sites and produced beautiful new facilities.\nAlthough a few logistical incidents occurred (a team was unable to shower when the athletes village lacked water, teams were missing tennis balls or towels), U.S. team chief Roland Betts, commented \"At times it has been a great struggle, but we are very excited and proud to see the venues. I believe these venues are as good as or better than any that have been created for the Pan American Games.\" Other attendees agreed that logistical and venue problems declined greatly during the Games.\nConcerns and controversies.\nNumerous protest marches were staged to call attention to austerity measures, including import taxes and spending cuts, and neglect of impoverished areas. During the Games, the protests were banned from the city. However, the Dominicans warmly embraced the Games with pride, especially when local heroes such as Félix Sánchez won the first local gold medal at the 400-meter hurdles and broke the Pan Am record at the games first week.\nWhile praising the first-rate facilities, critics decried the huge cost overruns, the high payroll of the organizers, and concerns over the Dominican Republic's ability to maintain the venues after the Games.\nMedal count.\n\"To sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the icon next to the column title.\"\n The medal counts for the United States, Canada and Mexico are disputed.\nSports.\nThe 2003 games marked the return of basque pelota and waterskiing to the Games.\nMascot.\nThe 2003 Games' mascot was a tank top clad manatee named Tito.\n2003 Parapan American Games.\nIn 2003, Parapan American Games was not hosted in Santo Domingo, but rather in Mar del Plata, Argentina. The event featured 1,500 athletes from 28 countries competed in nine sporting events. This was the 2nd and last Parapan American Games that was not tied to the Pan American Games."

        "text": "The 2007 Pan American Games, officially known as the XV Pan American Games, were a major continental multi-sport event that took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from July 13 to 29, 2007. A total of 5,633 athletes from 42 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 332 events in 34 sports and in 47 disciplines. During the Games, 95 new Pan American records were set; 2,196 medals were awarded; 1,262 doping control tests were performed and about 15,000 volunteers participated in the organization of the event, which served as an Olympic qualification occasion for 13 International Federations (IFs).\nRio de Janeiro was awarded the Games over San Antonio, Texas, United States, on August 24, 2002, having won an absolute majority of votes (30–21) from the 51 members of the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) in the first round of voting during the XL PASO General Assembly held in Mexico City, Mexico. This was the first Games held in Brazil since the 1963 Pan American Games that took place in São Paulo. According to the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee, the Games called for the implementation of the country's largest organizational and logistic operation ever until the 2011 Military World Games.\nBidding process.\nThe official bid was submitted in August 2001 during the XXXIX Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) General Assembly held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In April 2002, following delivery of Federal, State and City Government and BOC letters confirming country, state, city and Brazilian sport compliance with the applicable Games regulations, PASO announced the approval of Rio de Janeiro's bid. The Bidding Committee then submitted a detailed bid file for the Games. The document was prepared and developed with the assistance of Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), which had been commissioned by Rio de Janeiro's City Government. In the running to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio de Janeiro faced off with the city of San Antonio, United States; which previously beat Houston, Miami, and Raleigh to become the American candidate.\nAccording to PASO statute and regulations, the host city was selected by direct voting during the XL PASO General Assembly held in Mexico City, Mexico, on August 24, 2002. The candidate city that received the simple majority of votes from representatives of the 42 member National Olympic Committees (NOCs) would be awarded the right to host the competition. The\nannouncement was made by PASO President Mario Vázquez Raña. Rio de Janeiro received 30 votes against 21 from San Antonio. Marked by a professional strategy that included the showing of city and project videos, Rio de Janeiro's campaign convinced the majority of voters, accounting for a total 51 votes. The 39-member Brazilian delegation erupted into boisterous celebration celebrating the country's highest achievement in terms of sporting event organization.\nMascot.\nThe organization of the Rio 2007 Games has chosen the figure of the Sun to represent the event. And, in a decision never taken before, it has defined it as the single mascot of the Pan American and Parapan American Games, such as the Brazilian commom expression, that the \"Sol Brilha para Todos\" (The sun shines for everyone), reinforcing thus the all human rights and that, like the sun, sport and the life are for all.\nThe character reflects the main characteristics of the host city (call as \"harmonic diversity between humanity and nature\") and harmonizes with the graphic work developed for the logo and the visual identity of both Games. The name was chosen through popular voting by Internet, cellular phone messages and public ballot boxes placed around the main Brazilian cities, causing great commotion. Over 1.2 million people participated in the election, and the name Cauê received almost half of the votes.\nTraditionally used in large sport events, the mascot figure serves the purpose of cheering the event, enforcing the playful aspect of sports and captivating spectators and athletes. The mascot's main choice is to transmit messages of peace, respect to the environment, friendship and brotherhood, which are intrinsic values to the Olympic Movement.\nTorch relay.\nThe 2007 Pan American Games torch relay was a 39-day torch run, from June 5 to July 13, 2007, held prior to the games. On June 4, the torch was lit at the torch lighting ceremony in Teotihuacán, Mexico. The flame was then taken by a Brazilian Air Force craft to Porto Seguro Airport and an indigenous welcome ceremony was held in Santa Cruz Cabrália, Bahia, Brazil, where the torch relay began.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe Opening Ceremony of the XV Pan American Games took place on July 13, 2007. Approximately 90,000 people packed Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã Stadium for the occasion. The ceremony included a cast of 7,000 and a multimillion-dollar budget, being produced by Scott Givens. Over 800 people were part of the creative and production teams working on the Opening Ceremony, Team Welcome Ceremonies, Sports Production, the presentation of 2,252 medals, Sports Production, the Closing Ceremony and ParaPan ceremonies.\nThe show began at 05:30 pm (local time, UTC-3) and lasted for two and a half hours. The theme of the show was based on the theme of the Rio 2007 Games: \"Viva Essa Energia\" (Share the Energy) and the oath of the athletes was performed by Brazilian Taekwondo athlete Natália Falavigna. Also, a very abbreviated version of the Olympic Anthem was played.\nContrary to plan, the games were not opened by Brazil's head of state, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but by the head of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, Carlos Nuzman. Prior to the official opening, Lula had been constantly booed whenever the in-stadium camera showed his image or when his name was mentioned.\nVenues.\nThe competitions were carried through in a ray of 25 km, spread for four polar regions in the city.\nMain construction work of the 2007 Pan American Games, the João Havelange Olympic Stadium hosted the athletics and football competitions. The stadium is one of the major Games' legacies to the city of Rio de Janeiro, which can since then count on a modern stadium with full capacity to be used for sports and cultural events. The City of Sports Complex counts on modern constructions such as the Rio Olympic Arena, where the Games' basketball and artistic gymnastics competitions were held; the Maria Lenk Aquatic Park, venue for the swimming, synchronized swimming and diving competitions; and the Barra Velodrome, where the track cycling and speed skating events took place. Riocentro Convention Center is the largest expositions and fairs center of Latin America, for the 2007 Games, the complex held temporary facilities for staging several sport disciplines, including in the Parapan American Games. The Miécimo da Silva Sports Complex is the largest sports complex owned by a City Government (City Hall) in Brazil. Several large sports events took place at this venue, such as the basketball exhibition game between the teams of American Magic Johnson and Brazilian Oscar Schmidt, in addition to several matches of the Brazilian Futsal team. The Deodoro Military Club is a traditional Brazilian Army sport facility in Rio de Janeiro, will host the Rio 2007 Games equestrian, field hockey, modern pentathlon, sport shooting and archery competitions.\nThe Maracanã Stadium was built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, the Mario Filho Stadium (internationally known as Maracanã) is one of the most famous stadiums in the world, receiving a great number of Brazilian and foreign tourists annually. The stadium staged the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football matches, including the finals. The Maracanãzinho Gymnasium is the house of the Rio 2007 volleyball competitions. The Julio Delamare Water Park is the stage for the water polo tournament in the Games. The Maracanã Sports Complex also includes the Celio de Barros Athletics Stadium, and it is administered by the Rio de Janeiro State Government.\nAlso known as \"Aterro do Flamengo\", the Flamengo Park is the largest leisure area of the city. Besides Marina da Glória, the main venue for the Rio 2007 sailing competitions. During the Games, the marathon (men's and women's) arrival points set up at the Flamengo Park, which also staged the race walking and road cycling competitions.\nSports.\nApart the tensions between PASO and the Organizing Committee who proposed only the 2008 Summer Olympics program and the futsal as the only optional sport.In early 2005,PASO and Rio 2007 Organizing Committee added 5 sports provided for in the Pan-American Games charter (bowling, karatequash, water skiing and roller sports) to the program while racquetball and basque pelota were dropped due the low popularity and the lack of infrastructures at the host country."

        "text": " \nJim Johnson (May 26, 1941July 28, 2009) was an American professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He was a defensive coordinator for nine seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles. Widely regarded as one of the best defensive coordinators in NFL history, he was especially known for being a master architect of blitzes, disguising them skillfully and keeping offenses off balance.\nJohnson played as a tight end for two years with the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL). In more than 40 years of coaching, he held head coaching duties only once (at the collegiate level), but was interviewed by the Arizona Cardinals regarding their head coaching vacancy in 2004.\nPlaying career.\nA native of Maywood, Illinois, Johnson played high school football for Proviso East High School in Maywood, Illinois. He played college football for head coach Dan Devine at the University of Missouri from 1959 to 1962. An all-Big Eight quarterback, Johnson played in the same backfield with long-time NFL executive Bill Tobin. He went undrafted in the 1963 NFL Draft, but was signed to play tight end by the Buffalo Bills of the AFL (1963–64).\nCoaching career.\nJohnson began his coaching career as head coach at Missouri Southern (1967–68), before serving four-year tenures at Drake University (1969–72) and Indiana University (1973–76). In 1977, Johnson was hired by his former head coach at Missouri, Dan Devine, as defensive backs coach at University of Notre Dame. After helping the 1977 Fighting Irish to win the national championship in his first year, Johnson was later promoted to defensive coordinator and assistant head coach under Gerry Faust.\nLeaving Notre Dame in 1984, Johnson coached in the short-lived USFL with the Oklahoma Outlaws (1984) and Jacksonville Bulls (1985). In 1986, he finally entered the NFL as a coach, spending eight seasons with the St. Louis/Phoenix Cardinals (1986–93). After overseeing the Cards defensive line for four seasons, Johnson excelled as their secondary coach, helping Aeneas Williams become the first rookie cornerback to lead the league in interceptions (6) since 1981.\nIn 1994, he joined the Indianapolis Colts as linebackers coach under head coach Ted Marchibroda. After defensive coordinator Vince Tobin left the Colts in 1996 to become head coach of the Cardinals, Johnson was deemed his successor by new Colts head coach Lindy Infante. The Colts finished last in the AFC East in 1997, causing Infante and his staff to be fired.\nJohnson spent the 1998 NFL season as linebackers coach on the final staff of Seattle Seahawks head coach Dennis Erickson, before leaving for Philadelphia. He helped the Seahawks register 10 TDs on defense, including 8 INTs returned for scores, 2nd most in NFL history. If Johnson had stayed, he could have stepped into the coordinator's role when Fritz Shurmur died of cancer that summer.\nOn January 22, 1999, Eagles head coach Andy Reid targeted and hired Jim Johnson as the Eagles new defensive coordinator. Johnson's tenure in Philadelphia was his most successful, as the Eagles won 5 division titles, each reaping the benefits of his defenses. Because head coach Andy Reid is known more for his acumen on the offensive side of the ball, he handed complete control of the defensive unit of the team to Johnson, allowing Reid to concentrate on running the offense with his offensive coordinators, Brad Childress and later Marty Mornhinweg.\nReid repeatedly said he had full confidence in Johnson and the Eagles rewarded him accordingly, as he became one of the highest paid coordinators in the NFL. \"As I've said many times, Jim Johnson is the best in the business at what he does\", said Reid upon signing his prized defensive coordinator to a lucrative four-year contract extension in 2005. \"His defensive units continue to produce at a very high level as he puts a lot of pressure on opposing offenses.\"\nFrom 2000–07, Johnson's units rank tied for first in the NFL with 342 sacks, second in the league in 3rd down efficiency (34.3%) and red zone touchdown percentage (43.0%), and fourth in fewest points allowed (17.6 per game).\nIn 2001, Johnson's unit became the fourth team in NFL history to go all 16 games without allowing more than 21 points. Their streak of allowing 21 or fewer in 34 straight games was second longest in NFL history (Minnesota, 1968–71). In 1999, Johnson's unit forced an NFL-best 46 turnovers, including a team-record 5 interceptions returned for TDs.\nEagles defenders were selected for the Pro Bowl 26 times during Johnson's tenure. Former Eagle Brian Dawkins led the way with seven. Other Eagles defenders to go to the Pro Bowl under Johnson include Troy Vincent (five), Jeremiah Trotter (four), Hugh Douglas (three), Lito Sheppard (two), and Trent Cole, Michael Lewis, Asante Samuel, Corey Simon, Bobby Taylor (one each).\nCurrent NFL head coaches John Harbaugh (special teams and defensive backs), Ron Rivera (linebackers), and Sean McDermott (defensive backs and linebackers) coached under Johnson with the Eagles.\nIllness and death.\nShortly after the Eagles were eliminated from the playoffs, on January 29, 2009, it was announced that Johnson was undergoing treatment for melanoma. In mid-May, Johnson announced a leave of absence due to the advancement of the cancer, with secondary coach Sean McDermott taking over duties as the interim defensive coordinator.\nOn July 24, 2009, Johnson officially resigned as defensive coordinator, with McDermott having the interim tag removed. Four days later, on July 28, 2009, Johnson died at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 68."

        "title": "The Hogs (American football)",
        "text": "The Hogs were a nickname given to the offensive line of the Washington Redskins (now known as the Washington Commanders) of the National Football League during the 1980s and early 1990s. Renowned for their ability to control the line of scrimmage, the Hogs helped the Redskins win three Super Bowl championships (XVII, XXII and XXVI) under head coach Joe Gibbs. The Washington Commanders pay homage to the Hogs with their mascot, Major Tuddy.\nHistory.\n\"The Hogs\" was a term coined by offensive line coach Joe Bugel during training camp in 1982, when he told Russ Grimm and Jeff Bostic, \"Okay, you hogs, let's get running down there.\" Center Jeff Bostic, left guard Russ Grimm, right guard Mark May, left tackle Joe Jacoby, right tackle George Starke, guard Fred Dean, along with tight ends Don Warren and Rick Walker comprised the original Hogs. While Starke retired in 1984 shortly after the team won their third NFL Championship and first Super Bowl in Super Bowl XVII, Bostic, Grimm, Jacoby, and Warren stayed together until the early 1990s and were on all three Redskins Super Bowl winning teams under Gibbs.\nThe line averaged 273 pounds in 1982 with Jacoby weighing in at around 300 pounds. Early on, the Hogs provided cover for running back John Riggins and quarterback Joe Theismann. Riggins was accepted as an \"Honorary Hog.\" Quarterback Theismann threw a key block one day and begged to be named an \"honorary piglet.\" Theismann never had to hit a blocking dummy every day, which is why he never made \"piglet.\" Besides, Bugel said: \"We don't want a quarterback in the gang.\" \"No quarterbacks,\" Starke said at the time. Theismann has said in numerous occasions that after that block he did make it into \"The Hogs\" as a \"Piglet.\"\nTheir successes inspired a group of male fans who came to be known as the \"Hogettes\", who attended games dressed in \"old lady\" drag (dresses, wide-brimmed hats) and wearing plastic pig snouts. The Hogettes cheered on the Redskins for 30 years before announcing their retirement in 2013.\nSoon after losing Super Bowl XVIII 38–9 to the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984, Starke retired. Theismann's career ended in 1985, after he suffered an injury while being tackled by New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Riggins retired after the 1985 season. Shortly after, the Redskins were joined by a new class of Hogs, including 1985 draft pick Raleigh McKenzie, a left guard from the University of Tennessee, and 1989 draft pick Mark Schlereth, a right guard from the University of Idaho, along with Ray Brown, Ed Simmons, and Pro Bowl left tackle Jim Lachey, who was acquired in a trade with the Los Angeles Raiders. With their help, Washington won two more Super Bowls - XXII in 1988 and XXVI in 1992. Grimm was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010."

        "title": "Ron Turner (American football)",
        "text": " \nRonald David Turner (born December 5, 1953) is a former American football coach and player.\nTurner was most recently an offensive consultant with the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL) in 2017. He was head coach of the Florida International University (FIU) Panthers football team from 2013 to 2016. Turner served as the head football coach at San Jose State University in 1992, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1997 to 2004. He also had two separate stints as the offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL), the first from 1993 to 1996, and most recently from 2005 to 2009.\nPlaying career.\nTurner played college football as a wide receiver for Diablo Valley College from 1973 to 1974, and the University of the Pacific from 1975 to 1976. He was inducted into Pacific's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009. He earned a scholarship to the University of the Pacific, where he led the Tigers in receiving in 1975 and 1976 and totaled 40 receptions for 666 yards with three touchdowns.\nCoaching career.\nCollege coaching career.\nTurner began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Pacific before earning his first full-time college job coaching running backs and receivers at University of Arizona (1978–1980). He moved on to be an assistant at Northwestern University (1981–1982), the University of Pittsburgh (1983–1984), the University of Southern California (1985–1987), Texas A&amp;M University (1988), and Stanford University (1989–1991), before earning his first head coaching job at San Jose State University in 1992. Turner was the head coach at San Jose State for one season before being hired by Dave Wannstedt in the first of his two stints as the Bears offensive coordinator.\nBetween his two stints with the Bears, Turner spent eight years as head coach at the University of Illinois. His overall record at Illinois was 35 wins and 57 losses, for a winning percentage of .380. The highlight of his tenure came in 2001 when he guided the Illini to a 10–2 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and an appearance in the Sugar Bowl, which Illinois lost to LSU. That season, Turner was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year. His only other winning season was in 1999, when he led the Illini to the MicronPC Bowl, which the Illini won by a 63–21 scoreline—at the time the second-highest points ever scored by a team in a collegiate bowl game.\nTurner followed up the successful 2001 campaign with three consecutive losing seasons and was fired. Two of his teams were winless in the Big Ten, going 0–8 in 1997 and again in 2003. Turner is the only coach in the more than 100-year history of Illinois football to lose 11 games in a season, which he also accomplished in those same two seasons. His 1997 team was only the third in school history not to win a single game, going 0–11. Turner presided over three of the top six offenses in Illini history in terms of total yards, while four of his eight Illinois squads currently rank in the school's top 11 for scoring, including the 2001 team that scored a school-record 390 points. Three of the top six all-time leading rushers at Illinois and three of the school's top ten all-time leading receivers played during the Turner era. There were over 20 former Illini who played under Turner on NFL rosters at the end of the 2007 season. One of Turner's former players at Illinois who also went on to the NFL, Josh Whitman, was named director of athletics at the university on February 26, 2016.\nChicago Bears.\nThe Bears team completion percentages in 1994 (61.4%) and 1995 (60.2%) rank as the highest in team history. Chicago's net passing yard total of 3,743 in 1995 ranks second in team annals while the total of 3,185 in 1996 was pushed to sixth in team history by the team's totals from 2006 and 2007. With Erik Kramer at quarterback in 1995, the Bears set a team record for passing yards per game with 233.9 while compiling the fifth-most points in team history with 392. Kramer set club records with 29 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions (least among 16-game starters). The 1995 squad produced the third-most total net yards (5,673) and the second-most first downs (340) in team history. The offense also featured a 1,000-yard rusher and two 1,000-yard receivers in 1995, the only such season in team history. During his earlier four years with the Bears as offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach under head coach Dave Wannstedt, Turner guided some of the most prolific offenses in club history.\nTurner was hired for his second stint with Chicago on January 9, 2005, replacing Terry Shea as Bears offensive coordinator. Coincidentally, Turner had also replaced Shea as head coach at San Jose State in 1992. In the 2005 season, Chicago started a rookie a quarterback, Kyle Orton, who was a fourth-round draft pick, and compiled a 10–5 record. Chicago featured the eighth-ranked running game in the NFL in 2005. The 2,099 rushing yards totaled by the Bears were the franchise's most in a season since 1990 when the team rushed for 2,436 yards. Chicago also tied for the NFL-lead with 19 runs of 20 or more yards in 2005 after recording just seven such rushing gains in 2004. On the season, the Bears rushed for over 100 yards in 13 of 16 regular season games featuring six individual 100-yard rushing performances.\nTurner contributed to Chicago's appearance in Super Bowl XLI by coordinating an offense that ranked 15th in the NFL in total yards in 2006. He has coordinated the team's offense in each of its last six playoff games with Chicago owning a 3–3 record in those contests while averaging 25.7 points per game. Turner also holds the distinction of being the offensive coordinator for each of the top two quarterbacks in Bears history in single-season gross passing yardage. Erik Kramer set the franchise record with 3,838 passing yards under Turner in 1995 while Rex Grossman finished 2006 as the runner-up in that category with 3,193 yards. The Bears were the only NFL team with six players with five or more touchdowns in 2006. Chicago's 38 offensive touchdowns (24 passing, 14 rushing) in 2006 were the unit's highest single-season total since scoring 44 in 1995. In 2006, the Bears led the NFC while tying for second in the NFL with 427 points, the second-highest single-season scoring total in franchise history.\nChicago topped the 30-point plateau twice in 2008, four times in 2007 and accomplished the feat seven times during the 2006 season, the team's most 30-point games in one campaign since registering eight in 1956. The Bears scored 48 points against the Vikings on October 19, 2008, the most for the club since tallying 48 on December 7, 1986, versus Tampa Bay. The offense has compiled more than 300 total net yards in 25 of their last 48 games after doing so just three times in 2005; the third season of Turner's first stint with the team. The last time Chicago had six players combine for at least five touchdowns was 1948.\nIn 2008, the Bears passing offense continued to develop under Turner. Bears quarterbacks threw for over 3,000 net passing yards for the third straight season, a first for the franchise since the 1997–99 campaigns. Chicago has passed for over 3,000 net yards in six of the previous eight seasons under Turner's direction. In 2008, Turner helped oversee the development of rookie running back Matt Forte. Forte set Bears rookie records for rushing yards (1,238), yards from scrimmage (1,715) and receptions (63). The passing game was led by quarterback Kyle Orton in 2008. In 2008, Orton recorded the sixth-most passing yards in team history (2,972), fourth-most completions (272), the fifth-highest completion percentage (58.5) and 13th-highest passer rating (79.6) in 15 starts. Orton's nine starts without an interception in 2008 were tied for fourth-most in the NFL and most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Orton also threw a team-record 205 consecutive pass attempts without an interception last season. Chicago scored 375 total points in 2008, tied for seventh-most in franchise history. In 2009, Bears acquired Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler. After throwing 19 TD passes and 25 interceptions in the first 14 games, Cutler passed for eight TDs and one pick in season's last two games against the Vikings and Lions, giving him more TDs (27) than interceptions (26) this season. The Bears offense generated season-highs vs. Detroit with 418 total yards and 22 first downs, giving the unit 718 yards and 41 first downs in its final two games. On January 5, 2010, he and several of his assistants were fired. The Bears qualified for the postseason in three of Turner's eight seasons with the team.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nAfter being fired by the Chicago Bears after the Bears poor 2009 season, Turner was hired as offensive coordinator by Stanford. However, four weeks later he became wide receivers coach for the Indianapolis Colts.\nFIU.\nOn January 3, 2013, Turner was hired as the head coach of FIU, becoming the young program's third coach and taking the reins as the program entered Conference USA. He led the team to a 1–11 record and a seventh-place finish in Conference USA's East Division. In his second season, Turner led the team to a 4–8 record.\nOn September 25, 2016, Turner was relieved of his duties as head coach.\nPersonal life.\nTurner is the brother of Norv Turner, former head coach of the San Diego Chargers. Ron and his wife, Wendy, have two sons, Morgan and Cameron, and two daughters, Cally and Madison. \"Cam\" played quarterback for The Citadel and is currently in his first season as QB coach of the Indianapolis Colts. He has also coached in offensive capacities for the Arizona Cardinals prior to his stop in Indianapolis. This is after serving as the quarterbacks and wide receivers coach at FIU and working for the Carolina Panthers. Before that, he served as an assistant to Leslie Frazier for the Minnesota Vikings. Morgan is currently the tight ends coach for the Arkansas Razorbacks."

        "title": "Ray Miller (baseball manager)",
        "text": "Raymond Roger Miller (April 30, 1945May 4, 2021) was an American pitching coach and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). A highly regarded pitching coach, he was known for bringing improvement to the pitchers he coached at many stops over his career. His successes as a pitching coach twice led him to be promoted to manager, where he was much less successful. He managed the Minnesota Twins (1985–86) and the Baltimore Orioles (1998–99), each for less than two seasons and with a losing record each time, compiling an overall managerial record of 266–297 (.472).\nEarly life.\nMiller was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, on April 30, 1945. He was raised in nearby Forestville and attended Suitland High School, where he was selected as an all-state player in baseball. He signed with the San Francisco Giants in 1963.\nProfessional career.\nPlaying.\nMiller made his minor league debut with the Lexington Giants of the Western Carolinas League in 1964. He split time evenly as starting pitcher and reliever in his rookie year, starting 18 of the 36 games he pitched that season. He was subsequently acquired by the Cleveland Indians the following season. Despite winning 16 games with the Reno Silver Sox of the Class A California League in 1968, Miller never reached the Major Leagues as a player. The highest level he attained was Class AAA, with Portland of the Pacific Coast League, Wichita of the American Association and Rochester of the International League from 1969–73. He became a full-time relief pitcher from 1970 season onwards. He finished his minor league career with a 60–65 win–loss record, a 3.50 earned run average (ERA), and 992 strikeouts over 1,012 innings pitched.\nCoaching.\nIn his final season at Rochester, he was a player-coach, and then became minor league pitching instructor for the Red Wings' parent club, the Orioles, from 1974–77.\nAt the close of the 1977 season, Miller agreed to join the coaching staff of the Texas Rangers, whose manager was former Baltimore third-base coach Billy Hunter. But in January 1978, the Orioles' pitching coach position opened unexpectedly when George Bamberger was named skipper of the Milwaukee Brewers. Miller was let out of his Ranger contract and succeeded Bamberger as mound tutor of the pennant-contending Orioles. He worked under managers Earl Weaver and Joe Altobelli and coached for O's teams that won the 1979 American League championship and the 1983 world title. Miller tutored 20-game-winning pitchers such as Jim Palmer, Mike Boddicker, Mike Flanagan, Steve Stone, and Scott McGregor during that period. It was with the Orioles where he began famously instructing his pitchers to \"work fast, change speeds, throw strikes.\"\nThe success of the Orioles' pitching staff made Miller a sought-after managerial candidate and on June 21, 1985, he received his first opportunity. Billy Gardner, who had led the Twins to a disappointing 27–35 record, was fired and Miller took control of the young Minnesota ballclub. Although the Twins improved to 50–50 over the remainder of the season, they performed so poorly (59–80, .424) in 1986, Miller was replaced as skipper by Tom Kelly on September 12.\nMiller subsequently returned to the coaching ranks, spending ten seasons as pitching mentor of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1987–96) working for Jim Leyland and one (1997) back in Baltimore under Davey Johnson. When Johnson resigned at the close of the Orioles’ AL East Division championship season, Miller replaced him as manager. However, over the next two seasons (1998–99), the Orioles played ten games under .500, and he was fired in favor of Mike Hargrove in November 1999.\nMiller returned as pitching coach of the Orioles in 2004–05, and the Baltimore mound staff showed improvement under his tutelage. However, he was forced to the sidelines by successful surgery to repair an aneurysm, and was succeeded in that role by Leo Mazzone in 2006.\nLater life.\nMiller retired from coaching in 2005. He was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame five years later on August 7, 2010.\nMiller died on the evening of May 4, 2021, at the age of 76.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;\n "

        "text": "David McWilliams (born April 18, 1942) is a former American football player and coach. He served as the head coach at Texas Tech University in 1986 and at the University of Texas at Austin from 1987 to 1991, compiling a career college football record of 38–30.\nEarly life and playing career.\nRaised in Cleburne, Texas, McWilliams' long tenure with the Longhorn football program started as a player from 1961 to 1963, when he helped the team compile a record of 30–2–1. During that time, the squad won a national championship, three Southwest Conference championships, and finished the year ranked among the nation's top four each year. He served as a tri-captain during the 1963 season, and was also a member of the Texas Cowboys.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating, McWilliams served two years as an assistant coach at Abilene High School in Texas, and in 1966, became one of the state's youngest head coaches, carving out a record of 21–17–2 in four years before Darrell Royal hired him in 1970.\nFor the next 16 years, he was an assistant under both Royal and Fred Akers, working on defense with ends and linebackers for Royal and Akers, then serving as defensive coordinator for Akers from 1982 to 1985. McWilliams then spent the 1986 season as head coach at Texas Tech, leading the Red Raiders to a win over Texas and a bowl bid, before returning as head coach of the Longhorns the following year.\nMcWilliams finished 7–5 in his first season at the helm for the Longhorns that included a dramatic last-play victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks and a bowl win over Pittsburgh. However, a 4–7 season the next year, which included a 66–15 loss to Houston, followed by a 5–6 year in 1989, put McWilliams' job status in question. In 1990, the Longhorns bounced back with a 10–1 regular-season record. Fueled by what became known as the \"Shock the Nation\" tour, Texas won the SWC championship—the only loss coming at the hands of eventual national champion, Colorado. Texas entered the New Year's Day Cotton Bowl Classic ranked number three in the nation, but was defeated by Miami, 46–3. The resurgence gave rise to talk of a national title in 1991, but when Texas disappointed with a 5–6 record, McWilliams resigned. His final record with the Longhorns stands at 31–26.\nLater life and honors.\nMcWilliams remained in the Texas athletics department, serving as associate athletics director for development before becoming head of the T-Association, an athletic alumni group. He was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1993 and the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame in 1998."

It was the first WWF game to be released on the Game Boy Advance, and the only one released under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed in 2002. The main part of the game is the season mode where players have to win matches to get a heavyweight championship title match.\nThe game was succeeded by \"WWE Road to WrestleMania X8\".\nGameplay.\nThe game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes, with multiplayer being available through the Game Boy Advance Gamelink cable. The single-player game modes have a variety of match types including Exhibition, Gauntlet, Season, King of the Ring, Royal Rumble, Iron Man, and Pay Per View. Due to memory and roster limit restrictions, the Royal Rumble game mode is limited only to a maximum of 24 participants, compared to the average of 30 in its real-life variant. The season mode is incredibly similar to career modes found in other sports and wrestling games alike, which involves the player choosing a wrestler and building their career with the end goal of reaching WrestleMania, WWE's premier event of the year. Every week the player is subjected to various matches against the other competing wrestlers on the roster.\nReception.\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic."

        "text": "The 2003 Giro d'Italia was the 86th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro began in Lecce with a mass-start stage. The race came to a close with a individual time trial that began and ended in the Italian city of Milan. Nineteen teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Gilberto Simoni of the team. Second and third were the Italian Stefano Garzelli and Ukrainian Yaroslav Popovych.\nIt was Simoni's second win in the Giro. After the race, it was discovered that sixth-placed Raimondas Rumšas had tested positive in this Giro.\nThis edition of the Giro was the first UCI endorsed race where the wearing of helmets was compulsory.\nWith Gilberto Simoni's general classification victories in 2003 and in 2001, Simoni became the eighteenth rider to repeat as winner of the Giro d'Italia. In addition to the general classification, Simoni also won the points classification. In the race's other classifications, rider Fredy González won the mountains classification and Magnus Bäckstedt of the Team Fakta-Pata Chips team won the intergiro classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the nineteen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was won by .\nTeams.\nA total of 19 teams were invited to participate in the 2003 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders (only Kelme–Costa Blanca started eight), so the Giro began with a peloton of 170 cyclists. Out of the 170 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 97 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe 19 teams that took part in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 2003 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 30 November 2002 in Milan. It contained two time trial events, all of which were individual. The organizers divided the remaining eighteen stages into three categories: flat stages, rolling stages, and mountain stages. Twelve of the stages were declared flat stages. Of the seven stages remaining, three stages were designated rolling stages and three were ranked as mountain stages. In the stages containing categorized climbs, six had summit finishes: stage 3, to Terme Luigiane; stage 7, to Monte Terminillo; stage 12, to Monte Zoncolan; stage 14, to Alpe di Pampeago; stage 18, to Chianale; and stage 19, to Cascata del Toce. The organizers chose to include two rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer, contained the same amount of rest days, and one less individual time trial. In addition, this race lacked an opening prologue like the previous year had.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2003 Giro d'Italia, five different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the \"Cima Coppi\"), which in 2003 was the Colle d'Esischie, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the intergiro classification, marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.\nThere were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Colombian Fredy González won the Most Combative classification. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was won by Gilberto Simoni. The \"Trofeo Fuga Piaggio\" classification rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. The classification was won by Constantino Zaballa. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. was the most successful in avoiding penalties after not being penalized during the race, and so won the Fair Play classification."

        "text": "Derrick Williams (born July 6, 1986) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Detroit Lions with the 18th pick of the 3rd round of the 2009 NFL draft. He was a wide receiver and 2008 team captain for the Penn State Nittany Lions.\nHigh school.\nWilliams was widely regarded as the top high school football prospect of 2005, coming out of Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland. He received scholarship offers from more than 50 Division I schools. Relentless recruiting forced him to twice change his cell phone number. He was named \"Rivals.com\" High School Junior of the Year in 2003, and was ranked as the number one recruit in the nation after his senior year.\nWilliams initially leaned towards attending the University of Florida, but re-opened his recruitment after the firing of head coach Ron Zook. He strongly considered offers from Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee, before announcing live on ESPN that he would attend Penn State. Penn State was coming off four losing seasons in five years, and head coach Joe Paterno was under increasing pressure to retire. Williams relished the challenge of returning the Penn State program to its former stature, saying \"I did it because I trusted in [Paterno]. He promised me I could help turn the program around and leave my mark there, which I did.\"\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman, Williams was spectacular at quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. His touchdown catch late in Penn State's matchup with Northwestern that year won the Lions that game and was nominated for a Game-Changing Performance of the Year. It was part of an explosive, four-touchdown start that was cut short by a broken arm he suffered during the Nittany Lions' October 15, 2005 loss against the University of Michigan, the team's only loss that season.\n\"The Sporting News\" named Williams to the freshman All-Big Ten Conference team despite having played just seven games in 2005. He was named to the preseason All-Big Ten second-team for the 2006 season by \"The Sporting News\".\nIn the 2006 year he returned at wide receiver for the Nittany Lions, but registered just two touchdowns all season. He played both running back and wideout in the Outback Bowl, helping Penn State to a 20–10 win against Tennessee.\nHe began the 2007 season with only 6 catches for 45 yards in his first two games, but had an electrifying 78-yard punt return touchdown against Notre Dame, his second career special teams touchdown. He ended the season with 55 receptions for 529 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also had 16 rushing attempts for 101 yards and a touchdown. He had a season-high ten catches for 95 yards and one score vs. in a 26–19 win over Purdue.\nPrior to the 2008 season, Williams was nominated to the Maxwell and Biletnikoff Award watchlists.\nWilliams became the first player under the coaching of Joe Paterno to score a touchdown on a catch, run, and kick return in the same game, when he accomplished the feat against the Illinois Fighting Illini on September 27, 2008. The Nittany Lions won the game 38–24. Williams was named the Big Ten special teams player of the week following the Nittany Lions victory. At the end of the 2008 season, he was named a first-team All-Big Ten selection. He ended the season with 44 catches for 485 yards and a career-high four touchdown receptions. In his final game, the 2009 Rose Bowl loss to Southern California, he had a fourth-quarter touchdown reception.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nAt the 2009 NFL Combine, Williams ran 4.55 seconds in the 40-yard dash. He recorded a slower time than anticipated partly because he had the flu. \nDetroit Lions.\nWilliams was selected by the Detroit Lions in the third round (#82 overall) of the 2009 NFL draft. He signed a three-year contract with the team on July 29, 2009. Williams was waived by the Lions on September 3, 2011.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nWilliams was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers in January 2012. After playing in 4 pre-season games, he was released by the Steelers on August 31, 2012.\nToronto Argonauts.\nWilliams signed with the Toronto Argonauts on March 13, 2013. He was released by the team on May 2, 2013.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams has a longtime friendship with former Nittany Lion linebacker LaVar Arrington. The two first met during Arrington's time with the Washington Redskins, when Williams was playing high school football in nearby Greenbelt, Maryland.\nArrington gave Williams the nickname \"Jesus Shuttlesworth,\" after the lead character—a highly coveted high school recruit—in Spike Lee's \"He Got Game\".\nWilliams trained with an athletic group known as The Stable, with whom he has worked out since he was 10 years old, working on speed, agility, and endurance."

        "title": "WrestleMania 23",
        "text": "WrestleMania 23 was the 23rd annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on April 1, 2007, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. It was the second WrestleMania to take place in the Detroit metropolitan area (following WrestleMania III, which was held at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan). It was also the first WrestleMania to feature the ECW brand following its establishment as WWE's third brand in May 2006. It is the highest grossing PPV event in professional wrestling history. \nEight professional wrestling matches were scheduled for the event, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event of the show, which was the main match on the Raw brand, was John Cena versus Shawn Michaels for the WWE Championship, in which Cena won. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was Batista versus The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which The Undertaker was victorious. The primary match on the ECW brand saw ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley (representing Donald Trump) defeat Raw's Intercontinental Champion Umaga (representing Vince McMahon) in a match where either Trump or McMahon would be shaved bald if their wrestler lost. The match was billed as the \"Battle of the Billionaires\". Other featured matches included an eight-man tag team match between The ECW Originals and The New Breed and an eight-man interpromotional Money in the Bank ladder match.\nTickets for the event went on sale on November 11, 2006. The event set the all-time Ford Field attendance record of 80,103 people; people from all fifty U.S. states, twenty-four countries, and nine Canadian provinces attended the event. WrestleMania 23 grossed $5.38 million in ticket sales, breaking the previous record of $3.9 million held by WrestleMania X8. WWE estimated that $25 million was pumped into the Detroit economy. With about 1.2 million buys, the event, at the time, was the most bought WWE pay-per-view in history. 2012's WrestleMania XXVIII surpassed the event as the most bought WWE pay-per-view, receiving 1.21 million buys. WrestleMania 23 was also the fifth highest attended WrestleMania in history behind only WrestleMania 29 (which drew 80,676 fans), WrestleMania 35 (which drew 82,265 fans) WrestleMania III (which drew 93,173 fans), and WrestleMania 32 (which drew 101,763 fans).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania 23 was scheduled to be held on April 1, 2007, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brands. It was the first to feature ECW, a relaunch of the former Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion that became a WWE brand in June 2006, subsequently also being the first to feature the ECW World Championship (although it was not defended at this event as the champion competed in a non-title match).\nThe set design for WrestleMania 23 began development in October 2006 after WWE set designer, Jason Robinson, first received the final logo for the event. Robinson and his team first surveyed Ford Field in July 2006 and began planning out the staging and lighting designs. After returning to the stadium in January 2007 for more site surveying, Robinson and his team finalized the set's design in February. The final design resulted in WrestleMania 23 having the largest set ever built for a WrestleMania event. It incorporated 414 LED video screens and automated lights, 10 spotlights, 56 searchlights, 50,000 ft of cable for pyrotechnics and other use, and 35 stage flamethrowers used to produce 30 ft high and 6 ft wide flames, all which gave the set a unique look for each performer's entrance and an expanded stage lighting element of 300 ft in width and 100 ft in height using the specialized stage lighting instruments. The ramp used to reach the ring from the entrance set was 187 ft in length.\nThough it took three weeks to fully prepare Ford Field, set assembly began the week before WrestleMania 23 and was completed shortly before the day of the event. It took a week for 300 staff members, unloading and working from forty semi-trucks, to build the set and assemble the event's lighting within Ford Field, far more than the usual forty hours, 100 staff members, and fourteen semi-trucks required for the production of WWE's weekly television events. After the event concluded, it took around thirty hours to disassemble the set and lighting, also far more than the usual three hours required for WWE's weekly television events.\nStorylines.\nWrestleMania 23 featured professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from existing scripted feuds and storylines played out on WWE's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed faces (heroes) or heels (villains) as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a match or a series of matches.\nThe main staged rivalry heading into WrestleMania 23 was between WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and future 45th President of the United States Donald Trump. On the January 8 episode of \"Raw\", Trump faced off against his real-life rival, Rosie O'Donnell. Trump won the contest, although local wrestlers portrayed Trump and O'Donnell. During McMahon's \"Fan Appreciation Night\" on the January 29 episode of \"Raw\", Trump interrupted and dropped large sums of money into the arena. The following month, the two came up with a match for WrestleMania, where the stipulations for the match were that they each had to choose a representative to wrestle for them and the loser would have his head shaved bald. This match was then billed as the \"Battle of the Billionaires\". McMahon picked Umaga as his representative, while Trump picked Bobby Lashley. After successfully defending his ECW World Championship against Hardcore Holly in a Steel Cage match, a match in which the ring is surrounded by a steel cage on an edition of \"ECW on Sci Fi\", Lashley charged at the cage, slammed through it, and landed atop of Umaga, who was at ringside. On the March 5 edition of \"Raw\", Steve Austin was appointed as special guest referee for the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" match at WrestleMania 23. On the March 26 edition of \"Raw\", McMahon faced off against Lashley in a No Disqualification match. In the match, several people interfered on McMahon's behalf, including Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, Chris Masters, Johnny Nitro, and Umaga. This interference allowed McMahon to win the bout.\nThe main rivalry on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Shawn Michaels over the WWE Championship. After The Undertaker, the winner of the 2007 Royal Rumble match, made his decision to face Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania, a match to determine the next challenger to the WWE Championship was announced. Michaels defeated Randy Orton and Edge in a Triple Threat match to win a chance to face Cena at WrestleMania. On an edition of \"Raw\", Orton and Edge, who were tag team partners as Rated-RKO, attempted to attack Cena, but Michaels ran-in and attacked them with steel chairs. Before a scheduled tag team match between Rated-RKO and Cena and Michaels, Orton played a video that highlighted the past friendships that Michaels was involved in, before turning on the friend. In the match, Michaels nearly superkicked Cena after Orton moved. Due to a later disagreement, Edge left Orton and walked off backstage, which allowed Cena and Michaels to win the match. The following week, Michaels responded to the video set-up by Orton, and made comments regarding Cena.\nAfter Michaels defeated Orton, Cena ran-down to the ring and saved Michaels from an attack by Edge and Orton. On the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania, Cena and Michaels would team up to face Batista and Undertaker in a rematch from their match at No Way Out. Cena and Michaels looked set to win after performing a synchronized Five Knuckle Shuffle, but Michaels turned on Cena and superkicked him, which allowed Batista and Undertaker to win the match.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Batista and The Undertaker over the World Heavyweight Championship. Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match to earn a championship match against any one of WWE's three world championships (WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW). On the February 5 episode of \"Raw\", Undertaker chose to challenge Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship when he chokeslammed him at the center of the ring. In the weeks leading to WrestleMania 23, Batista and Undertaker partook in tag team matches. At the beginning of the feud, Batista claimed to have great respect for The Undertaker; however, after several attacks by The Undertaker, Batista claimed to have lost all respect for him especially at No Way Out when Batista gained some payback by delivering a Spinebuster to The Undertaker, allowing Raw's WWE Champion, John Cena and Shawn Michaels to deliver their signature moves on The Undertaker for the victory during their inter-promotional WrestleMania 23 tag team main event. On the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania during a rematch between Cena and Michaels against Batista and Undertaker from No Way Out, Undertaker walked out of the match in response to Batista attacking him during the first encounter, leaving Batista to fight alone against Cena and Michaels. However, Batista and Undertaker would end up winning the match after Michaels betrayed Cena by hitting him with a superkick, which allowed Batista to pin Cena for the win.\nThe main feud on the ECW brand was between two teams of four; The ECW Originals and The New Breed. The feud mainly revolved around which team was the \"dominant force\" in the revived ECW brand. The two factions of four-faced off in several tag team matches throughout the weeks prior to the event. The New Breed seemed to have dominated for several weeks; however, ECW Originals leader, Rob Van Dam, defeated New Breed leader Elijah Burke in a singles match. ECW Original Tommy Dreamer issued the challenge to the New Breed for an eight-man tag team match at WrestleMania 23, which was accepted by Burke on behalf of The New Breed.\nThe last major feud involved eight men. Several weeks before WrestleMania 23, it was announced that the Money in the Bank ladder match would be held again, as it was in the last two years. This year, however, there would be eight men involved, rather than six the two previous years had. Throughout the weeks leading up to WrestleMania 23, qualifying matches took place on all three shows. On an edition of \"Raw\", Edge, the winner of the match held in 2005, defeated Rob Van Dam, the winner of the match held in 2006, to earn the first spot in the match. The next night on \"ECW\", another cross-brand match took place, with CM Punk defeating Johnny Nitro to qualify. On that week's \"SmackDown!\", King Booker became the third man to qualify, defeating Kane in a Falls Count Anywhere match after The Great Khali interfered. On the next edition of \"Raw\", Jeff Hardy pinned Shelton Benjamin in a match to become the fourth man to qualify. The next night on \"ECW\", Mr. Kennedy defeated Sabu in an Extreme Rules match to earn the fifth spot. On the next \"SmackDown!\", two qualifying matches took place, with Matt Hardy and Finlay winning their respective match to qualify when Matt Hardy defeated Joey Mercury and Finlay defeated WWE US Champion, Chris Benoit &amp; Montel Vontavious Porter in the Triple threat qualification match. The final qualifying match took place on \"Raw\" between Carlito and Ric Flair. The match was deemed a no-contest after The Great Khali interfered and attacked both men. The following week, on \"Raw\", Randy Orton defeated Flair and Carlito in an elimination match to become the final man to qualify. After Edge and Orton had split as a team, the two attempted to get the other taken out of the Money in the Bank ladder match. Both men failed, however, as Edge won a \"last chance\" battle royal to retain his spot and Orton won a match on \"ECW\" to retain his.\nAt No Way Out, WWE United States Champion Chris Benoit and the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) defeated MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). After Benoit and MVP had some matches with the two in them (tag team and triple threat matches), MVP decided to start showing he was the \"true\" United States Champion. MVP would then have matches against the \"champions\" of other countries (including Luxembourg and Scotland, who in reality were jobbers), beating them within minutes. MVP then challenged Benoit for the title at WrestleMania 23.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, Ric Flair and Carlito faced Gregory Helms and Chavo Guerrero in a tag team lumberjack match. Flair and Carlito controlled the early part of the match until Helms threw Flair over the top rope. The lumberjacks attacked Flair before throwing him back into the ring. Helms and Guerrero continued to beat on Flair, but couldn't pin Flair. Guerrero tried to end it with his frog splash, but Flair moved. Guerrero tagged in Helms, but Flair tagged in Carlito. Carlito dominated Helms, leading to Guerrero coming in to help Helms, but Flair came in and fought Guerrero. Flair and Guerrero took each other out of the ring, and before the lumberjacks could throw them back in the ring, Carlito hit the Backstabber on Guerrero to pick up the win for himself and Flair.\nThe event officially began with Aretha Franklin singing a rendition of \"America the Beautiful\", reprising her role from twenty years earlier at WrestleMania III.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first match that aired, Edge, Randy Orton, Jeff Hardy, King Booker (with Queen Sharmell), Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy, Finlay, and CM Punk competed in the third annual Money in the Bank ladder match. The match featured many notable spots, including points where Edge performed the Spear on all the other opponents, followed by Orton doing the same by performing the RKO later in the match. Kennedy missed a Kenton Bomb, landing on a ladder, and received a Swanton Bomb from Jeff. Several dangerous ladders spots were also featured, including Orton performing an RKO on Punk off a ladder, and Booker performing a Book End to Orton off the ladder as well. Midway through the match, Jeff climbed a fifteen-foot-high ladder inside the ring and on his brother, Matt's urging, he performed a leg drop off of that ladder onto Edge, through another ladder bridged between the ring apron and the barricade. They were carried off on stretchers by the paramedics. Later, when Booker was about to retrieve the contract briefcase, Matt held Booker's wife, Sharmell as a hostage, threatening to perform a Twist of Fate on her. Booker went to her aid and received the Twist of Fate from Matt. Finlay fought Matt for some time in the ring, and also performed the Celtic Cross to Matt onto a ladder. Finlay's associate Hornswoggle emerged from under the ring and attempted to retrieve the briefcase for Finlay. He was stopped by Kennedy, who performed his Green Bay Plunge on Hornswoggle. Kennedy went on to win the match, only after knocking Punk off a ladder by hitting him with another ladder.\nThe next match was billed as a \"SmackDown! versus Raw Interpromotional match\". Raw's The Great Khali faced SmackDown!'s Kane. It was a short match but contained a notable spot. In homage to Hulk Hogan slamming André the Giant twenty years earlier at WrestleMania III, Kane picked up Khali for the first time and body-slammed him to the mat. The match ended with Khali pinning Kane after a Giant Chokeslam. After the match, Khali choked Kane out with Kane's chained hook, which was a reference to Kane's movie, \"See No Evil\", where his character used the hook as a signature weapon.\nA backstage segment was featured next, which involved Cryme Tyme persuading Eugene to dance with Extreme Expose instead he danced with Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah, who were dressed as strippers as Cryme Tyme danced with Extreme Exposé. Also featured in the segment were WWE Legends Slick, Ricky Steamboat, Jimmy Hart, Irwin R. Schyster, Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, Howard Finkel, Gene Okerlund, Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco, many of whom had not been seen on television in years until Farooq interrupted the festivities with his signature \"DAMN!\" catchphrase.\nIn the fourth match, Chris Benoit faced Montel Vontavious Porter for the United States Championship. The match started off with a chain of takedowns, holds, and reversals, with MVP keeping up with Benoit, even going for some submission holds. The match lasted almost ten minutes, with Benoit attempting to lock in some of his signature submission holds, but MVP successfully reversed them, including the Crippler Crossface. The two exchanged suplexes and holds until Benoit executed a Diving headbutt on MVP, which led to Benoit getting the pinfall victory to retain the WWE United States Championship. This was Benoit's last WrestleMania match.\nMain event matches.\nLong-time ring announcer Howard Finkel then introduced the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2007. The next match featured Batista defending the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker. The match started with Batista performing a Spear on Undertaker as the bell sounded. The match went back and forth, with both men countering each other and performing their finishers. Undertaker performed a Chokeslam, but Batista kicked out of the pinfall attempt. Undertaker was then able to perform a Last Ride to Batista for a near-fall. Midway through the match, Undertaker performed an Over The Top Rope Suicide Dive on Batista. At one point, Batista was able to perform a running powerslam on Undertaker through a broadcast table. Back in the ring, Batista executed a Spinebuster followed by a Batista Bomb for a near-fall. Undertaker then pinned Batista following a Tombstone piledriver to become the World Heavyweight Champion and emerge from WrestleMania with his winning streak intact. The Undertaker's win made him the first wrestler to have won both the World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE Championship at WrestleMania.\nThe ECW Originals (Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman) took on The New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von, and Matt Striker) next. The match started off with Cor Von working over Sabu. That changed when Cor Von tagged Striker, who missed an elbow after whipping Sabu into the ropes, allowing Sandman to get tagged. Sandman dominated Striker, and eventually tagged Van Dam. Van Dam used also dominated Striker but was poked in the eye, allowing Striker to tag in Burke. Burke had early success, but Van Dam regained the advantage and tagged Sandman again. Sandman worked on Burke until tagging Dreamer. Dreamer also beat down Burke until Cor Von received a blind tag and hit Dreamer from behind. Cor Von attacked Dreamer relentlessly and went over and punched Sabu, which distracted the referee and allowed Dreamer to be triple-teamed by Thorn, Burke, and Striker. Cor Von tagged in Burke who almost pinned Dreamer. Thorn entered next and almost performed his finishing move called the Original Sin. Dreamer managed to escape but was unable to tag his partners. Thorn tagged in Cor Von again who also almost pinned Dreamer. Cor Von tagged Thorn again, and Thorn resumed the beat down on Dreamer. Thorn tagged Striker next, and Striker attempted a suplex that Dreamer blocked and Dreamer suplexed Striker instead. Striker did not try to tag his partners and tried to stop Dreamer, but Dreamer tagged in Sabu. Sabu began to manhandle Striker and executed a leg drop from the top rope. Van Dam was then tagged in. Burke broke up Van Dam's pin attempt, which led to all competitors entering the ring. While the referee was distracted, Ariel gave Striker a chair. But Van Dam gave Striker an Van Daminator when he kicked the chair into Striker's face. Van Dam pinned Striker after a Five-Star Frog Splash to win the match for The Originals.\nThe match that WWE billed as the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" was next, as Umaga (accompanied by Vince McMahon and his handler Armando Alejandro Estrada) fought Bobby Lashley (accompanied by Donald Trump). Stone Cold Steve Austin served as the special guest referee. Trump was attended to by Tara Connor. Midway through the match, Austin was attacked by Umaga, causing him to become incapacitated and was taken out of the match for several minutes. Shane McMahon, who attempted to replace him as the referee, called the match while being biased toward Umaga. After Umaga got a near-fall on Lashley, Austin pulled Shane out of the ring, gave him a Stunner, and went back to the ring. Umaga attempted a Samoan Spike on Austin, but he avoided it and Stunned Umaga. Lashley took the opportunity and speared Umaga, then pinned him to get the victory. After the match, Trump and Lashley shaved Vince's head bald, followed by Austin executing a Stunner on Trump.\nThe next match was Melina against Ashley in a Lumberjill Match for the WWE Women's Championship. The match was short, as Melina Bridge pinned Ashley to retain the title. After the match, the lumberjills began brawling in the ring.\nThe main event was John Cena against Shawn Michaels for the WWE Championship. Cena made a grand entrance by driving a Ford Mustang through the streets of Detroit and smashing through a glass panel upon entering the stadium. After a back-and-forth match, the longest of the night, Cena applied the STF on Michaels, Michaels submitted and Cena retained the title. Following the match, Cena embraced while holding his retained championship and offered to shake hands with Michaels, who refused and walked away. He soon turned back and Cena saluted him before walking back into the ring as he celebrated with pyrotechnics and confetti filling the Ford Field.\nReception.\nThe event received generally positive reviews. Canadian Online Explorer writers Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk rated the entire event 8 out of 10 stars, which was the same rating as the previous year's event. The lowest rated match on the card was Kane versus The Great Khali with a 0.5 out of a 10 star rating, the WWE Women's Championship match between Melina and Ashley was the second lowest rated match; it was rated 2 stars. The \"Battle of the Billionaires\" match was rated an 8 out of 10 stars. Batista versus The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship match, one of the matches from the double main event, was rated 7.5 out of 10 stars. The main event match for the WWE Championship was rated a 9 out of 10 stars, and the Money in the Bank ladder match received the same rating. The attendance was reported to be 80,103 by numerous sources, a Ford Field record.\nAftermath.\nJohn Cena and Shawn Michaels continued their feud, with Michaels betraying Cena the night after WrestleMania on \"Raw\". During the second of two battle royals, Michaels eliminated himself and Cena, resulting in The Hardys winning the World Tag Team Championship. On the \"Raw\" before Backlash, Cena and Michaels wrestled an almost hour long non-title match, which Michaels won.\nBatista also continued his feud with The Undertaker, facing off against him in a Last Man Standing match the following month at Backlash. The match ended in a draw after both men failed to answer the ten count, therefore resulting in Undertaker retaining the title. The two faced each other in a Steel Cage match on the May 11, 2007, edition of \"SmackDown!\", which also ended in a draw after both men escaped the cage at the same time. The feud ended when The Undertaker dropped the World Heavyweight Championship due to a legitimate injury. Edge, who won Kennedy's Money in the Bank contract in a match on Raw the previous Monday, cashed it in and defeated The Undertaker after the Steel cage match to win the title.\nBobby Lashley's feud with Vince McMahon continued for a further three months after the event. Vince, livid after being embarrassed at WrestleMania, vowed to destroy Lashley and take his ECW World Championship. At Backlash, Vince, his son Shane and Umaga teamed up a Three on one handicap match against Lashley, and after two Samoan Splashes by Umaga from the top rope, Vince pinned Lashley to win the ECW World Championship. The feud continued for a further two pay-per-views, with Lashley pinning Shane in a rematch from Backlash at Judgment Day, but Vince ruled that as he did not get pinned, Lashley did not win the title. At One Night Stand, Lashley finally defeated Vince in a Street Fight to reclaim the ECW World Championship.\nThe match between Chris Benoit and Montel Vontavious Porter expanded into a lengthy feud for the WWE United States Championship, resulting in Benoit retaining via pinfall at Backlash and MVP winning the title in a Two out of three falls match at Judgment Day, winning 2–0.\nThe feud between the ECW Originals and the New Breed continued, with the New Breed defeating the ECW Originals in an Extreme Rules match on the next edition of \"ECW\". Sabu was released from the company shortly after WrestleMania, and The Sandman was drafted to Raw a few months later in the 2007 WWE Draft. Kevin Thorn left the New Breed shortly after WrestleMania and Marcus Cor Von was also released shortly thereafter. By this point, Elijah Burke and Matt Striker had ceased associating with one another, with Striker eventually being relegated to a manager role for Big Daddy V. In addition, Rob Van Dam left the company when his contract expired shortly after One Night Stand. As a result of all of this, the feud eventually puttered out and was rarely mentioned again.\nMr. Kennedy lost his Money in the Bank contract to Edge on the May 7 episode of \"Raw\", after Edge defeated Kennedy in a match with the briefcase on the line. Kennedy would be the only Money in the Bank contract holder to never cash in the briefcase until Otis in 2020. On the May 11, 2007, episode of \"SmackDown!\", after the Undertaker retained the World Heavyweight Championship in a steel cage match against Batista via a draw and was attacked by Mark Henry, Edge successfully cashed the contract in on a beaten-down Undertaker and won the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time in his career.\nThis was the last WrestleMania ever to be in 4:3 format until January 2008 when it went to high definition.\nSponsorship controversy.\nRockford-Montgomery Labs, through their brand 360 OTC, was named as the official sponsor of the event. On January 19, 2008, WWE filed a lawsuit against the company alleging non-payment of the sponsorship funds. A similar lawsuit was also filed by NASCAR Cup Series team Bill Davis Racing, which had run WWE and WrestleMania 23 sponsorship as part of their sponsorship deal with 360 OTC."

        "title": "Cycling power meter",
        "text": "A cycling power meter is a device on a bicycle that measures the power output of the rider. \nMost cycling power meters use strain gauges to measure torque applied, and when combined with angular velocity, calculate power. \nThe technology was adapted to cycling in the late 1980s and was tested in professional bicycle racing i.e.: the prototype Power Pacer (Team Strawberry) and by Greg LeMond with the SRM device. This type of power meter has been commercially available since 1989. Training using a power meter is increasingly popular.\nPower meters generally transmit data wirelessly and can be paired to a bike computer, smartphone, or smartwatch. \nBy providing instantaneous feedback to the athlete, and by allowing more precise analysis of rides, power meters can be a useful tool for training.\nInterfaces.\nOlder cycling power meters use a set of wires to transmit power information to a computer mounted on the bicycle; this system has a serious disadvantage of having fine electrical cables being run all over the bicycle, making it harder to clean as well as using a fair number of fasteners to hold them up. \nHowever, since 2009 there is a general trend to move towards wireless systems. \nPower meters generally transmit data over ANT+ or Bluetooth Low Energy protocols and can be paired to standard bike computers that display information about the power output generated by the rider.\nUse in training.\nPower meters provide an objective measurement of real output that allows training progress to be tracked very simply—something that is more difficult when using, for example, a heart rate monitor alone. \nCyclists will often train at different intensities depending on the adaptations they are seeking. \nA common practice is to use different intensity zones. \nWhen training with power, these zones are usually calculated from the power output corresponding to the so-called lactate threshold or MAP (maximal aerobic power).\nPower meters provide instant feedback to the rider about their performance and measure their actual output; heart rate monitors measure the physiological effect of effort and therefore ramp up more slowly. Thus, an athlete performing \"interval\" training while using a power meter can instantly see that they are producing 300 watts, for example, instead of waiting for their heart rate to climb to a certain point. \nIn addition, power meters measure the force that moves the bike forward multiplied by the velocity, which is the desired goal. \nThis has two significant advantages over heart rate monitors: 1) An athlete's heart rate may remain constant over the training period, yet their power output is declining, which they cannot detect with a heart rate monitor; 2) While an athlete who is not rested or not feeling entirely well may train at their normal heart rate, they are unlikely to be producing their normal power—a heart rate monitor will not reveal this, but a power meter will. Further, power meters enable riders to experiment with cadence and evaluate its effect relative to speed and heart rate.\nPower meters further encourage cyclists to contemplate all aspects of the sport in terms of power because power output is an essential, quantitative link between physiological fitness and speed achievable under certain conditions. A cyclist's VO2 max (a proxy for fitness) can be closely related to power output using principles of biochemistry, while power output can serve as a parameter to power-speed models founded in Newton's laws of motion, thus accurately estimating speed. The joint application of power meters and power models has led to increasingly more scientific analyses of riding environments and physical properties of the cyclist, in particular aerodynamic drag.\nDual-sided power measurement.\nDual-sided power meters, generally direct applied force or pedal power meters, can measure the power generated individually by the left leg and the right leg. The resulting data allow monitoring of the dominant/non-dominant leg ratio and observe how it varies in relation to different racing and fitness conditions. This can be useful to correct penalizing imbalances and in post-traumatic rehabilitation programs.\nPower meter types.\nMost cycling power meters use strain gauges to measure torque applied, and when combined with angular velocity, calculate power. \nPower meters using strain gauges are mounted in the bottom bracket, rear freehub, or crankset. \nCertain newer devices do not use strain gauges and instead measure power through handlebar-mounted units that utilize the principles of Newton's Third Law by measuring a cyclist's opposing forces (gravity, wind resistance, inertia, rolling resistance) and combining these with velocity to determine the rider's power output.\nCrank or spider.\nCrank and spider based power meters measure the torque applied through both pedals via strain gauge/s positioned within the crank or crank spider. A calculation of power is derived from the deflection of the strain gauge/s and pedaling cadence. While most crank-based power meters measure the power output of one leg only or need a second sensor to measure the power output of both legs, the spider-based power meters always measure the total power output of both legs.\nThese units require specific cranks or cranksets but can be relatively simple to interchange between bikes, depending on compatibility.\nPedals.\nPedal-based power meters can be located either in the pedal axle or in the pedal body. This type of cycling power meter measures the cyclist’s force exactly where it is applied, through one or both pedals. Power meters with sensors on both pedals can provide a real dual-sided power measurement, that is power data gathered individually on both legs. This feature is useful to observe and correct penalizing differences in performance between legs. \nPower meter pedals are easy to install and swap across bikes.\nBottom bracket.\nBottom bracket power meters rely on the torsional deflection in the BB shaft. This is done by the shaft having a disc at each end with perforations. These perforations are detected using non-contact photo-electric sensors that detect when torque is applied to the left pedal and then doubled. Data is sent digitally to a handlebar mounted computer unit.\nThese units are difficult to interchange and require a different bottom bracket unit for each bike.\nFreehub.\nA freehub power meter uses the same strain gauges that are present in the crank power meters, but it is located in the rear wheel hub and measures the power at the rear wheel. The power measured by a freehub power meter will be slightly less than the power measured by a crank-based power meter due to power losses in the chain, pedals, and bottom bracket. Because freehub power meters are built into the rear wheel, it is simple to interchange them among bikes so long as the wheels are compatible.\nChain.\nAt the heart of chain units is essentially a guitar pick-up that mounts to the cycle's chain stay.\nThe pick-up detects chain vibration from which it calculates chain tension which, along with chain speed, gives power output. Finnish company Polar was the first to bring a chain-based power meter to market.\nOpposing force.\nOpposing force power meters measure hill slope (gravity), bike acceleration (inertia), and sometimes, wind speed. From this, power can be indirectly calculated."

        "title": "Bowling machine",
        "text": "In cricket a bowling machine is a device which enables a batsman to practise (usually in the nets) and to hone specific skills through repetition of the ball being bowled at a certain length, line and speed. It can also be used when there is no-one available to bowl, or no one of the desired style or standard.\nThere are a number of different types of bowling machine available to cricket coaches, each quite different in the ways they achieve the required delivery, though most allow the use of remote control, so that a coach can be closer to a batsman when the stroke is played.\nMechanical bowling machines.\nThis type of machine is by far the most common. It is simple, strong and reliable, as well as being able to bowl a useful range of deliveries.\nHow they work.\nThe main mechanism of the machine consists of two heavy wheels, between 30 and 50 cm in diameter, fitted with solid or pneumatic rubber tyres, each driven by its own electric motor. These are mounted in a frame such that the wheels are in the same plane, about 7 cm apart (slightly less than the diameter of a cricket ball). A ball joint allows the machine a wide range of movement. The whole assembly is mounted on a sturdy tripod or other frame so that the plane of the wheels is roughly at the height that a typical bowler would release the ball. A chute delivers the ball between the wheels, protecting the coach's hands.\nThe motors are typically powered by a car battery, and turn in opposite directions. A controller allows variation of the speed of each wheel, allowing the machine to be slowed down for less experienced batsmen, or when the motors are not running at the same speed, swing or spin bowling can be simulated.\nThese machines will work with any ball of roughly the right size and weight, such as normal cricket balls or tennis balls. However, they usually work best with their own balls, bowling machine balls which are made of hard plastic, and are covered in dimples. These dimples are to help with the swinging characteristics when this type of delivery is desired.\nSimulating different deliveries.\nFast bowling.\nThis is achieved by setting both wheels to the same speed, as fast as the batsman is able to deal with, although the machine itself would have to be tipped horizontally. The coach can move the machine around slightly to vary the line and length of each ball.\nSwing bowling.\nThe plane of the wheels is flat, and the motors are set to run at slightly different speeds. This means the ball will spin about an axis perpendicular to the ground, causing it to swing due to the Magnus effect. If the ball is spinning anticlockwise (looking from above) the ball will swing from right to left; clockwise spin results in a swing from left to right. This means that if the coach slows down the wheel on one side, ball will swing in that direction. The swing produced in this way is different from normal swing bowling, however – it is much more like a curling ball in football.\nSpin bowling.\nTo achieve spin, the machine should be tilted to one side, and the wheels set to different speeds as per swing bowling. It will also probably be necessary to make the machine bowl significantly more slowly. The combined action of the spin imparted by the wheels, and the non-perpendicular axis of that spin will cause the ball to bounce up at an angle.\nWhile spinning always see the ball when it has been started to deliver the ball towards the wicket\nSeam bowling.\nThis is difficult to achieve since the operator cannot control exactly how the ball will roll into the machine and between the wheels. However, by the law of averages, a ball will occasionally come out with its seam at the correct angle, and bounce unpredictably as a result.\nBouncers.\nTo get balls that bounce unnaturally high or low, the plane of the machine must be set so that it is vertical. Not all machines can do this, simply because their ball joint doesn't give the required range of movement. To get balls that bounce higher than normal, the lower wheel should spin slightly faster than the upper. Deliveries that bounce much lower than normal are less common and are usually the result of the ball striking a broken-up patch of ground. These balls can still be simulated, however, by increasing the speed of the upper wheel.\nPneumatic bowling machines.\nThis design is significantly less common than the mechanical type and operates using a completely different principle.\nHow they work.\nMost of the space in the machine is a hopper that contains the balls. At the bottom of the hopper, near the front, is a rotor with space for six balls. The balls slot into the spaces on the rotor by gravity, which then takes them into the innards of the mechanism. The rotor passes over a trap-door, which the ball opens with its weight, falling into a small chamber.\nA pump is used to provide a flow of air into the chamber that the ball drops into. The airflow pushes the ball along the chamber to rubber ring, or gasket, known as a \"restrictor\". The restrictor has a hole through it that is sightly smaller than the ball, which the ball presses up against. This seals the hole, so air pressure builds up in the chamber. When the pressure is so great that the restrictor can no longer hold it, the ball bursts through, out of the main body of the machine and into an external tube, which guides it upwards and releases it at the height of a bowler's arm.\nSimulating different deliveries.\nFast bowling.\nA system exists that allows air to escape from the barrel shortly after it has passed the restrictor. This reduces the pressure on the ball, reducing its muzzle velocity. Closing this increases the speed to its maximum; its maximum speed is 160+ km/h (100+ mph).\nSwing bowling.\nTo do this a curved piece of tubing is attached to the end of the barrel. The ball rolls around this causing it to spin and swing.\nSpin bowling.\nThe tubing used for swing bowling can also be used for spin bowling, by pointing the curve somewhere between vertical and horizontal.\nSeam bowling.\nSeam bowling is impossible on this machine as it only accepts tennis balls and cricket training balls such as Slazenger's \"Slazball\" (a hard, small, low-bounce, heavy ball, similar in appearance to a tennis ball but usually red in colour). Neither of these types of ball has a seam.\nBouncers.\nThe tubing can again be used, this time to simulate high and low bounce by mounting the tube vertically.\nProgrammable bowling machines.\nBoth of the types of machines described above are fairly simple designs, intended for regular, hard use by clubs, and hence are simple to operate and reliable. They can only simulate one type of delivery with the machine in a given configuration and have other limitations, particularly with spin bowling, which limit their usefulness to players at the highest levels of the game.\nProgrammable bowling machines are intended to overcome some of these limitations by rapidly re-configuring themselves to bowl different types of delivery in quick succession.\nA programmable bowling machine called \"Merlyn\", which its makers claimed could \"bowl any ball known to man\" received much public attention when it was used by the English cricket team in the run-up to and during the 2005 Ashes series.\nOriginally a one-off, Merlyn was built by Henry Pryor, a cricket coach in Herefordshire. Its mechanism has not been publicly revealed, though it is safe to assume it is much more complex than the other machines.\nCrucially, the machine was claimed to be able to emulate Shane Warne's leg breaks, and although he is dismissive of its usefulness, the England batsmen disagree, and consider their ability to play spin bowling significantly improved.\nThe machine, as well as its mechanical abilities, also has significant elements of computer-control built in. It is claimed that it can reproduce an over from a particular bowler if fed the correct data.\nOne of the more unnerving aspects of the machine is that it provides no indication of the type of ball it is about to bowl until the ball has left the machine. This forces batsmen to work on their instinctive batting, rather than trying to second guess the bowler.\nAn improved version is currently in development at Loughborough University, which will add visual feedback by showing a representation of the bowler projected onto a screen. The ball will be released as the virtual bowler's hand reaches the hole from which the ball is released. This version of the machine is intended for mass production, so it can be sold to cricket clubs around the world. In the winter of 2009/10 the ECB acquired 20 of the machines, one for each county and two for the performance centre at Loughborough."

        "text": "Marcus Elmore Baldwin (October 29, 1863 – November 10, 1929), nicknamed \"Fido\" and \"Baldy\", was an American professional baseball pitcher who played seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). In 346 career games, he pitched to a 154–165 win–loss record with 295 complete games. Baldwin set the single-season MLB wild pitches record with 83 that still stands today.\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baldwin made his professional debut for a Cumberland, Maryland, team in 1883. Though signed by Chicago White Stockings president Albert Spalding to pitch against the St. Louis Browns in the 1886 World Series, Baldwin did not play after the Browns objected. He made his MLB debut for the White Stockings in 1887, when a writer for the \"Oshkosh Daily Northwestern\" called him the \"swiftest pitcher in the National League\" (NL). Released by Chicago player–manager Cap Anson, he signed with the Columbus Solons of the American Association (AA) in 1889, where he led the league in innings pitched (), losses (34), strikeouts (368), and walks (274).\nIn 1889, Baldwin, described as \"intelligent and outspoken\", recruited players for the Chicago Pirates of the Players' League (PL). Baldwin played for Chicago and finished the year as the PL leader in games played as a pitcher (58), innings pitched (492), wins (33), strikeouts (206), complete games (53), and walks (249), as the Pirates finished fourth in the league, ten games behind the first-place Boston Reds. A PL historian has described him as a star of the league. Back in the NL, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he played from 1891 to 1893. Baldwin was arrested after the Homestead strike in 1892 and charged with aggravated riot, but never received a trial. He finished his MLB career with the New York Giants in 1893, and played several seasons for independent teams afterwards.\nDuring his career, he batted and threw right-handed, weighed , and stood tall. After baseball, Baldwin became a physician and practiced at Passavant Hospital in Pittsburgh. He died of cardiorenal disease on November 10, 1929, and is interred at Allegheny Cemetery.\nEarly life.\nMarcus Elmore Baldwin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 29, 1863, to Franklin E. and Margaret Baldwin. One of two children born to the couple, Mark and his family moved to Homestead, Pennsylvania in 1872. Franklin, a real estate speculator, previously worked as a steelworker and a nailer. As a child, Mark wanted to be a physician. Mark started to pitch for amateur Homestead teams in 1880, and, after high school, attended Pennsylvania State College (PSC), later renamed Pennsylvania State University.\nProfessional career.\nBaldwin made his professional debut for a team in Cumberland, Maryland, in 1883, while he attended PSC. Two years later, he pitched for McKeesport, who finished first in the Western Pennsylvania League. According to an 1891 article in \"The Pittsburgh Press\", he earned per game for pitching for McKeesport. According to another article in the \"Press\", Baldwin had asked Pittsburgh Alleghenys secretary Scandrett for a tryout, and president William A. Nimick consented, but manager Horace Phillips opposed the idea and a tryout never happened. Instead, Scandrett wrote a letter recommending Baldwin to Duluth management. According to an article in the \"Pittsburgh Daily Post\", McKeesport manager Frank Torreyson recommended him to Duluth of the Northwestern League in spring 1886 as a third baseman, but the Duluth Jayhawks played him as a pitcher as their pitching was weak. \nOn June 18, 1886, Baldwin struck out 18 batters, 12 successively, against the St. Paul Freezers. Baldwin had 19 strikeouts in 12 innings in a 4–3 loss at Oshkosh, Wisconsin on September 13, 1886. According to a friend of Baldwin, when Duluth fined Baldwin for poor play, he intentionally performed poorly until Duluth revoked the fine. According to a \"Pittsburgh Daily Post\" writer, Duluth won its league pennant due \"chiefly on account of Baldwin's pitching\". After a tryout, Chicago White Stockings president Albert Spalding signed Baldwin to a contract on October 20 to replace injured rookie Jocko Flynn: Chicago wanted Baldwin to play in the 1886 World Series (which ran from October 18 to 23), but the opposing St. Louis Browns objected, so Baldwin never played.\nChicago White Stockings (1887–88).\nBaldwin listed his birthdate when he played for Chicago in 1887 as 1867, which followed a theme of childishness and \"extreme petulance\" in him according to baseball historian David Nemec. In spring training prior to the 1887 season, a hotel employee found Baldwin and Tom Daly unconscious in their room, which smelled of gas. Either Daly or Baldwin accidentally blew out a flame in a gas light. Baldwin almost died, but both were revived. In preparation for the year, Baldwin joined Chicago during spring training in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Though in March 1887, Baldwin \"expected to rank next to [John] Clarkson\" among Chicago's pitchers, in April, \"The Sporting News\" reported Baldwin \"[was] regarded in Chicago as little better than a failure\". On May 2, Baldwin made his MLB debut against the Indianapolis Hoosiers in a 9–1 Chicago loss.\nLater in the month, Baldwin held the Boston Beaneaters to one run in a 3–1 Chicago victory, part of a week in which Baldwin's development surprised a writer for \"The Post\", who discounted the earlier evaluation of Baldwin as a failure. In June, a correspondent for \"The Clipper\" complimented Baldwin on his endurance and curveballs, while an \"Oshkosh Daily Northwestern\" writer called him the \"swiftest pitcher in the National League\". Baldwin finished the season with an 18–17 win–loss record, with 164 strikeouts and 122 walks over 334 innings pitched, as Chicago finished 71–50, third in the NL. By December, Baldwin had re-signed with the club.\nWith the sale of Clarkson to Boston, only White Stockings' player–manager Cap Anson, according to one prediction, believed the team could win a pennant. In a May 30 game against the Washington Nationals, Baldwin sprained a tendon in his right leg, an injury from which he did not return until early July. The White Stockings finished the season second in the NL, nine games behind the New York Giants, with a 77–58 record. Baldwin led his team with 15 losses and 99 walks. \nBaldwin played on Spalding's 1888–89 World Tour. In a game seen by 12,000 spectators, Baldwin pitched for the Chicagos against the All-Americas in Melbourne as Chicago won 5–3, breaking a three-game losing streak. A monkey bit Baldwin on a ship on the tour after he fed it pretzels and beer; the bite has been reported in a different source as a serious scratch. On April 24, 1889, Anson released him and three other White Stockings and stated he would rather \"take eighth place with [a team of gentlemen] than first with a gang of roughs\"; according to Baldwin, Chicago did not restrict alcohol consumption on the tour (team owner Albert Spalding was a \"temperance crusader\"), and at various banquets Baldwin attended the wine \"flowed freely\". In addition to his alcohol consumption on the tour, Baldwin stated that after he hinted he would not sign for the salary of the previous season, he was released. Later in the year, Anson cited Baldwin's lack of pitch control as a reason for his release. Baldwin signed with the Columbus Solons of the AA on May 3.\nColumbus Solons and Chicago Pirates (1889–90).\nBaldwin, who debuted for the Solons on May 4 in a showing described by \"The Chicago Tribune\" as \"anything but credible,\" explained his poor opening game as a result of unfamiliarity with AA coaching methods. By late June, a month in which he hit a double, three triples, and a home run over a three-game span, Baldwin was \"doing better\", according to a writer for \"The Chicago Tribune\". According to a writer for \"The Saint Paul Globe\", Baldwin pitched the \"best ball in the [A]ssociation\" in July. On August 31, Baldwin set the single-game AA record for strikeouts with 13 against the Browns. In his only season in the AA, Baldwin led the league in innings pitched (), losses (34), strikeouts (368), walks (274), and wild pitches (83), the last of which set a major league record that still stands today. Baldwin's 274 walks set a then-MLB record, while his strikeout total is the most post-1886 except for Nolan Ryan, Sandy Koufax, and Randy Johnson.\nIn November 1889, Baldwin met in Chicago with the National Brotherhood of Professional Baseball Players, a union of baseball players which would form the Players' League (PL) in 1890, where the union reportedly discussed the formation of a Chicago team. According to John Montgomery Ward, \"the movement is an experiment on our part to have the men who do the work participate in the profits of the pastime\". On why he joined the league, Baldwin said he was \"not playing ball for principles\", but rather for the \"money that's in it\", and on other players in the PL stated \"not one of them ever had much faith in the principles which were said to have led to the revolt\".\nDespite an attempt by Anson to convince Baldwin to sign with an NL team in which Anson \"spent more money than he [had] spent before\", on November 21, Baldwin signed a PL contract for the Chicago team, nicknamed the Pirates. Baldwin's 1.77 \"average earned runs per game by opponents\" through May 21, 1890, ranked second-lowest in the PL, while his seven games played as a pitcher tied for second highest in the league.\nBaldwin finished the year as the PL leader in games played as a pitcher (58), innings pitched (492), wins (33), strikeouts (206), complete games (53), and walks (249), as the Pirates finished fourth in the PL, ten games behind the first-place Boston Reds. PL historian Ed Koszarek has described him as a star of the league. When the PL disbanded on January 16, 1891, as the NL and AA ratified a new National Agreement, Columbus retained Baldwin under reserve, and Baldwin officially signed with the team in January 1891 for $2,900 (). After a discussion with Alleghenys team owner J. Palmer O'Neil in February, he jumped contract (thereby jumping leagues) and signed with Pittsburgh late that month or early in March despite saying he did not want to play for the club earlier in the year.\nPittsburgh Pirates and New York Giants (1891–93).\nIn early March, Baldwin tried to convince Jack O'Connor of the Solons and Silver King of St. Louis to sign with Pittsburgh. Chris von der Ahe, owner of the St. Louis Brown Stockings, had Baldwin arrested for allegedly conspiring with O'Neil to sign players from St. Louis to Pittsburgh shortly thereafter. The charges were \"nolle prossed\", and Baldwin later sued von der Ahe for false imprisonment. After years of litigation, Baldwin won a judgement of $2,525 () against the owner in 1897. Around early 1891, the Alleghenys nickname changed to the Pirates due to the club's habit of signing players from other teams.\nIn August he allowed only one hit against the Boston Beaneaters in a complete game. He ended an eleven-game winning streak of games in which he pitched in September. Baldwin had a 2.76 earned run average (ERA) and a 1.40 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) rate in his first year with the club as the Pirates finished last in the NL; Baldwin's 23 hit batsmen led the league, while his totals in innings pitched, wins, losses, and complete games led the club. He re-signed with the Pirates in November.\nBaldwin pitched on Opening Day for Pittsburgh on April 12, 1892, in a 7–5 Pittsburgh victory against the Cincinnati Reds. In July, Baldwin asked Brooklyn Bridegrooms president Charles Byrne to trade him to the team in exchange for pitcher Tom Lovett. The proposition never went through, possibly because Brooklyn opposed it. Baldwin either asked for a ten-day vacation or the Pirates suspended him for ten games starting around August 6 due to indifferent play. Pittsburgh gave Baldwin a ten-day notice of intent to release on August 25, 1892 with a local paper stating the Pittsburgh magnates thought of him as \"unreliable, of uncertain temper and [believing] his heart was never in the game\". The Pirates possibly gave him a ten-day notice due to his involvement in the Homestead strike, a labor strike culminating in a battle between workers of the Carnegie Steel Company and members of the Pinkerton detective agency hired by management to introduce strikebreaker workers to the mill. \nIn September 1892, Carnegie Steel Company Secretary F. T. F. Lovejoy provided information which left Baldwin charged with aggravated riot. Baldwin stated he was at the strike \"merely as a spectator\", and when the surrender of the Pinkertons occurred he \"went to his home in Homestead and in no way aided or abetted the attack on the defenseless prisoners\". Baldwin was released from prison after his father posted $2,000 () bail. He later rejoined the club on the team's trip east, with the club recalling his release. Baldwin was re-arrested on September 23 along with 166 other defendants on the same charge, but never received a trial. He finished the 1892 season with a 26–27 win–loss record and a 3.47 ERA as the team ended with a 80–73–2 win–loss–tie record, sixth in the NL. He led the team in wins and losses, games pitched, innings pitched, complete games, walks, strikeouts, and tied with Red Ehret and Phil Knell for the league lead in hit batsmen.\nIn the off-season, Baldwin sold real estate and insurance in Homestead, and stated he did not care about returning to baseball after refusing a contract with the Pirates due to low wages. He re-signed with Pittsburgh in February 1893 for $2,400 (), the same amount for which he reportedly refused a contract with Pittsburgh earlier. In a game against a team from New Orleans during the off-season, Baldwin walked eleven batters. He appeared in one game for the 1893 Pirates before the club released him in early May. He signed with the New York Giants shortly thereafter in a move that also saw the release of King. In July, Baldwin ended a streak of eleven games pitched in which he did not record a win. He ended the year with a 16–20 record and a 4.10 ERA as the club finished at a 68–64–4 record (fifth in the NL). Baldwin's 33 complete games were second on the Giants to Amos Rusie's 50. In 346 career MLB games, he pitched to a 154–165 win–loss record with 295 complete games.\nIndependent ball (1894–95).\nIn March 1894, New York released Baldwin. An article in \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" stated Baldwin could not find a team with which to sign due to his lawsuit against von der Ahe. A retrospective article in \"The Washington Post\" stated Baldwin and King were \"marooned\" due to their involvement in the Association–League war of 1891, in which clubs from opposing leagues attempted to sign each other's players. Baldwin originally did not want to play in a minor league, though he signed with the Allentown Kelly's Killers in mid May. In a game against Harrisburg in late June, Baldwin allowed at least 23 hits. \nHe spent the 1894 season with the Binghamton Bingoes (also known as the Allentown Buffaloes) of the Eastern League (EL), the Allentown Kelly's Killers (also known as Easton and Ashland), and the Pottsville Colts, the last two of which competed in the Pennsylvania State League (PSL). The Colts ended the season with a 62–44 record, which ranked first in the PSL, and won the league's championship in a disputed game. An article in the Pottsville \"Miners Journal\" stated \"his excellent work for Pottsville in the championship games had much to do with bringing our club to first place\". He additionally played four games for the Yonkers club of the EL.\nBaldwin signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in October. Though an article in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" stated Baldwin was \"certain to stay\" with the team on March 31, 1895, the Phillies released him in April due to his drinking. The Phillies recalled his release in early May, but he did not appear in a regular-season game for the team. Shortly after his first release, Baldwin re-signed with the Colts for $200 () per month. The Colts granted his release in June, and he signed with the Rochester Browns of the EL for more pay; for Pottsville, he won over two-thirds of the games in which he pitched according to \"The Allentown Leader\". \nThe Browns released Baldwin due to poor performance which stemmed from drinking alcohol, after which he played for a team in Palmyra and a team in Wheeling of the Iron and Oil League. Baldwin pitched to a record of 10–12 between the Browns and the Colts. During his career, he batted and threw right-handed, weighed , and stood tall.\nAfter professional baseball and personal life.\nDuring at least two off-seasons, he joined his brother hunting. Baldwin was a close personal friend of Ad Gumbert.\nIn April 1896, Baldwin's father purchased a semi-professional baseball team which Mark helped organize. It folded before the end of its first season. After professional baseball, Baldwin coached the baseball team of the University of Pennsylvania. He started medical school at the university in fall 1898. He played as a guard on the American football team for either the University of Pennsylvania or Baltimore Medical College, to which he had transferred, or both. He graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree from Baltimore Medical College in 1900 and practiced in Rochester, Minnesota, in Columbus, and at Passavant Hospital in Pittsburgh.\nAccording to an obituary published in \"The Pittsburgh Press\", Baldwin \"spent some time with\" physicians William James Mayo and Charles Horace Mayo in Rochester and served as assistant coroner to George Frederick Shrady Jr. in New York City. He identified as a Republican in 1889, and, in 1910, supported former teammate John K. Tener in the latter's bid for Governor of Pennsylvania. Baldwin was a Freemason. He never married.\nHe died at Passavant Hospital on November 10, 1929, of cardiorenal disease after a long illness. He was interred at Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh."

        "title": "Women's World Golf Rankings",
        "text": "The Women's World Golf Rankings, also known for sponsorship reasons as the Rolex Rankings, were introduced in February 2006. They are sanctioned by 12 women's golf tours and the organisations behind them: Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA Tour), Ladies European Tour, Ladies Professional Golfers' Association of Japan (LPGA of Japan Tour), Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA of Korea Tour), WPGA Tour of Australasia, Epson Tour, China Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, the Ladies European Tour Access Series, Taiwan LPGA Tour, JLPGA Step Up Tour (JSU), KLPGA Dream Tour (KDT), and Thai LPGA Tour and also by The R&amp;A, which administers the Women's British Open and the United States Golf Association which conducts the U.S. Women's Open.\nThe idea of introducing a set of women's rankings similar to the Official World Golf Ranking was developed at the May 2004 World Congress of Women's Golf, and was first planned for 2005, but then put back to 2006.\nCalculation of the rankings.\nThe rankings are based on performances on the eight major tours (LPGA, JLPGA, KLPGA, LET, ALPG, Epson Tour, LETAS, CLPGA) over a two-year period. Amateur players are eligible. The system for calculating the rankings is similar to that for the men's Official World Golf Ranking. Players receive points for each good finish on the relevant tours, with the number of points available in each event depending on the strength of the field, as determined by the competitors' existing rankings (when the rankings were introduced rankings were calculated for earlier periods; the first ever set showed notional changes since the previous week). The only exceptions are the five LPGA majors and all Epson Tour, CLPGA and LETAS events which have a fixed-point allocation, presently 100 points for the majors. Rankings are weighted as to the time elapsed over the two years, making the recent results more important.\nOriginal formula.\nWhen the rankings were first introduced in February 2006, a player's ranking as calculated in the above description was divided by the number of events played, with a minimum required events of 15 over the previous two years. In addition, players were required to play in a minimum of 15 eligible events over the previous two-year period to be included in the rankings.\nFormula revisions.\nOn August 2, 2006, the Rolex Rankings Board and Technical Committee announced following its bi-annual meeting two changes to the ranking formula. \nMany commentators saw the latter change as directed at Michelle Wie, who at the time was ranked second in the world despite having competed in only 16 women's professional events in the two-year period. However, the chairman of the Rolex Rankings Technical Committee defended the change as one designed to make the women's rankings more comparable to the Official World Golf Ranking for men, which use a minimum divisor of 40 events.\nOn April 16, 2007, another modification in the formula was introduced. Instead of points being awarded on an accumulated 104-week rolling period, with the points awarded in the most recent 13-week period carrying a higher value, points began to be reduced in 91 equal decrements following week 13 for the remaining 91 weeks of the two-year Rolex Ranking period rather than the seven equal 13-week decrements previously used. This modification did not have an immediate impact on the rankings.\n2019 event table.\nThe events with the highest \"Event rating\" in 2019 are shown in the following table.\nCriticisms.\nWhen they were introduced the rankings attracted considerable criticism on two grounds. First, it was widely felt that members of the LPGA of Japan Tour were ranked too high, since few of them had competed successfully outside Japan. Second, the minimum of 15 events needed to qualify for a ranking was widely seen as having been selected purely to enable Michelle Wie to be highly ranked because she had played exactly that number in the preceding two years, while every other highly ranked player had played many more events. If the women's rankings used the same system used for the men's rankings – that is a minimum number of events of one but a minimum denominator of 40 to calculate the average points per tournament – Wie would have been just outside the top 10. But under the women's ranking system where only players who had played a minimum number of events were included, if the minimum number of events had been set higher than 15, Wie would not have been ranked at all.\nThe August 2006 revised formula addressed the second criticism. The technical committee that administers the rankings urged patience with regard to the first criticism, since the continuing \"strength of the field\" weighting of tournaments may correct the issue without any technical changes being made.\nSignificance of the rankings.\nThe rankings are used by each of the sponsoring tours to determine eligibility criteria for certain events. For example, 40 of the 144 places in the Women's British Open are currently awarded on the basis of the rankings—10 to LET members and 30 to LPGA members. Four of the 12 places in the European Solheim Cup team are allocated on the basis of the rankings. For the U.S. Solheim Cup team, the top two players on the rankings not already qualified make the team.\nSince 2013, the rankings at the end of each LPGA Tour season in odd-numbered years have determined the eight countries that will compete in the following year's International Crown, a LPGA-sponsored team event scheduled in even-numbered years and first held in 2014. More specifically, the countries whose top four players have the highest cumulative rankings are invited to compete. The individual participants from each qualified country are determined by the rankings immediately prior to the ANA Inspiration (known before 2015 as the Kraft Nabisco Championship) in the year of the event.\nCurrent top ten.\n\"As of 29 April 2024\"\nChange column indicates change in rank from previous week.\nNotes \nHistorical rankings.\nAnnika Sörenstam of Sweden topped the first set of rankings, which was released on Tuesday 21 February 2006. Paula Creamer (United States); Michelle Wie (United States); Yuri Fudoh (Japan); and Cristie Kerr (United States) took the other places in the top 5. The top one hundred players in the initial rankings came from the following countries:\nBreakdown by nationality.\nA breakdown of the year-end top-100 by nationality."

        "text": "Edward Francis Lynch (born February 25, 1956) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and executive who played in Major League Baseball. He attended Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, Florida. During his career, he pitched and batted right-handed, and his pitch selection included a fastball, slider, changeup and slurve.\nMLB career.\nLynch was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 22nd round of the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft. After three years in their farm system, in which he compiled a 22–27 record and 3.89 earned run average, the Rangers sent him to the New York Mets on September 18, as part of an earlier deal in which the Mets sent Willie Montañez to the Rangers for two players to be named later. The other player the Rangers sent the Mets was first baseman Mike Jorgensen.\nLynch debuted with the Mets on August 31, against the San Francisco Giants, and gave up four earned runs in just 1.1 inning out of the bullpen. He won his first major league start on September 13 against the Chicago Cubs, snapping a thirteen-game losing streak for his club. For the season, Lynch was 1–1 with a 5.12 ERA in four starts.\nThe Mets and Cubs were perennially the bottom two teams in the National League East for the early part of Lynch's career, however, they had evolved into division rivals at the top of the N.L. East by the time Lynch took the mound in the second game of a double header on August 7, . The first game was won by the Cubs, 8–6, on the strength of a six-run fifth inning, which included a three-run home run by Keith Moreland. During a five-run fourth inning in the second game, Lynch hit Moreland with a pitch, inciting a bench clearing brawl. The Cubs won the second game, 8–4.\nIn 1985 Lynch went 10–8 with a 3.44 ERA in a career high 191 innings pitched. Baseball writer Bill James said at that time that Lynch had the best control of any National League pitcher other than LaMarr Hoyt. Lynch made only one appearance for the Mets in , pitching 1.2 innings in relief in the third game of the season, when he went on the disabled list with torn cartilage in his left knee. By the time he was ready to return, he'd lost his spot in the starting rotation to the young pitchers on the World Champion squad. The Mets traded him to the Cubs for Dave Liddell and Dave Lenderman. He remained with the Cubs through before retiring.\nAs an executive.\nAfter his career ended, he attended the University of Miami School of Law, and graduated in 1990. Using his Juris Doctor degree and prior baseball experience, he was named director of player development of The San Diego Padres. He was named assistant general manager of the New York Mets in 1994 and was named general manager of the Chicago Cubs on October 10,1994. Ed then became a Major League scout for 16 years for the Cubs and Toronto Blue Jays. Ed currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona with his wife Kristin and specializes in real estate with The Key Team at KMF Realty in Scottsdale Arizona.\nAs a coach.\nLynch was announced as the new pitching coach for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2019 season. However, he resigned just two months into the season on June 25, 2019, in order to spend more time with his family."

The club was named in recognition of the Cambridge University Blue Boat which beat Oxford in The Boat Race in 1899 after a period of Oxford domination.\nIt was founded as a spin-off from the YMCA Boat Club after some members decided they wanted the freedom to smoke, drink and row on Sundays.\nClub colours.\nThe blade colours are sky blue with dark green and \"yellow\" bands; kit: sky blue, old gold and dark green.\nThe boathouse.\nNines boathouse is one of the best-equipped in Cambridge, with large training areas for ergs and weights in addition to a considerable fleet of boats across all classes. There are also changing rooms, showers, fully equipped kitchen and well-stocked bar for social activities.\nThe current three-storey boathouse was built to the design of a Swiss chalet, the previous boathouse on the site having been destroyed in an arson attack in August 1983.\nMembers.\nNines welcomes all levels of rower from the complete novice to those with national experience. The club has men's, women's and junior squads and has a strong record of developing rowers, with a number of members having competed at GB level and within the Cambridge University Blue squad for The Boat Race.\nClub events.\nNines organise two regattas each year. The Spring Regatta is an Eights event and is raced to a large extent by local Cambridge University College crews preparing for May Bumps in addition to the local Town Clubs.\nThe Autumn Regatta is a much larger event, attracting Clubs from throughout the UK, and is the only Regatta in Cambridge run under the auspices of British Rowing.\nThe Club organise many social events throughout the year as a key part of rowing life in Cambridge and members are regularly involved in fundraising for a range of charities.\nRowing events and achievements.\nThe biggest race in the local calendar is the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association Bumps in which all club members participate. The men's First boat currently hold the Headship position, while the women's First boat currently hold sixth place. In 2019, a Club record 17 crews were entered for Bumps (9 Women's Eights and 8 Men's Eights) and in addition to Men's Headship, were awarded the John Jenner trophy for most successful Club and the Stephen Allen Bowl for best-performing Juniors. The 2020 Bumping races were cancelled due to the Covid pandemic.\nIn the 1990 CRA Bumping Races, the club was the first to hold the 'Head of the River' position simultaneously in both the Men's and Women's events, and in 2006 became the first Club to hold both first and second places on the river simultaneously in the Women's event.\nOn the Thames, 1993 saw the Men's squad win the Jackson Trophy at the Head of the River Race (HoRR), finishing in 13th position overall.\nNines compete at all the local Cambridge events and also travel extensively throughout the UK (and overseas) to challenge at major events. In 2019, several Nines crews competed in the Head of the Charles Race in the US, while a Men's 4+ travelled to Belgium to compete in the Ghent International Regatta, winning a silver medal.\nHenley Royal Regatta is a key event for the club, with crews entered most years, in addition to the Henley Women's event. Most-recently, two Men's crews successfully qualified and competed in the Wyfold Challenge Cup in 2019."

        "title": "Skeleton key",
        "text": "A skeleton key (also known as a passkey) is a type of master key in which the serrated edge has been removed in such a way that it can open numerous locks, most commonly the warded lock. The term derives from the fact that the key has been reduced to its essential parts.\nMaster keys.\nA skeleton key is a key that has been filed or cut to create one that can be used to unlock a variety of warded locks each with a different configuration of wards. This can usually be done by removing most of the center of the key, allowing it to pass by the wards without interference, operating the lock. To counteract the illicit creation of such keys, locksmiths can put wards not just in the center but on the outside as well, making the creation of a skeleton key more difficult.\nLever lock skeleton keys are used in a lock with usually three or five levers and a set of wards that come into contact with the bit of the key only on the sides—the top is for pushing the levers to their correct heights while the warded section of the key just has to pass uninterrupted to allow the key to rotate fully. A \"master key\" system of lever locks has the same lever heights in all locks. Each door will have different wards and can only be opened by the correctly warded key or the master key. A \"skeleton key\" has the warded section of the key removed so that it opens all the doors of a system.\nSome applications, such as a building with multiple entrance doors, have numerous locks that are keyed alike; one key will open every door. A keyed-alike system is different from a master key system as none of the locks have a key that can open only that lock.\nSkeleton keys have often been associated with attempts to defeat locks for illicit purposes, to release handcuffs for example, and standard keys have been filed down for that purpose. Legitimate skeleton or master keys are used in many modern contexts where lock operation is required and the original key has been lost or is not available. In hotels without electronic locks, skeleton keys are used by housekeeping services to enter the rooms."

It was established in 1893, and is now the oldest golf club in Canada still located on its original site; a rocky point on the South Eastern tip of Vancouver Island, overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca. It is also one of Canada's few courses that is open for play an average of 360 days per year. Several holes provide views of the ocean.\nThe course today plays to par 70 for men, 73 for women, and its length is just over 6,000 yards from the back tees. The club celebrated its centennial in 1993, by hosting the Canadian Amateur Championship."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball replacement players",
        "text": "This is a list of Major League Baseball replacement players. The Major League Baseball, an American and Canadian baseball league, has used replacement players during two strikes: the 1912 Detroit Tigers strike, and the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike.\n1994–95 Major League Baseball strike.\nThe following Major League Baseball players appeared as strikebreakers during spring training in 1995, crossing picket lines during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Some had not yet been placed on a 40-man roster, and as such were not eligible to join the MLBPA at the time of the strike, while others were former MLB players who had retired before the strike. The list does not include replacement players who never appeared in regular-season MLB games.\nCertain players who were part of World Series-winning teams were not permitted to have their names or likenesses on commemorative merchandise because they had been declared replacement players for having participated in the 1995 spring training. The players were Shane Spencer of the 1998, 1999 and 2000 New York Yankees, Damian Miller of the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, Brendan Donnelly of the 2002 Anaheim Angels, and Brian Daubach and Kevin Millar of the 2004 Boston Red Sox.\nThe names or likenesses of replacement players, since they are not permitted to join the MLBPA, are also in some cases not included in merchandise which derives its license from the MLBPA, such as video and tabletop games. Many games nevertheless include them, with blank or fictional names and different appearances similar to how Jon Dowd was used to replace Barry Bonds in MVP Baseball 2005 after he left the MLBPA in 2003.\nReplacement players.\nNo MLB experience before strike.\n Chimelis was briefly called up by the San Francisco Giants in June 1995, but never appeared in an MLB game, making him a phantom ballplayer.\n1912 Detroit Tigers strike.\nOn May 15, 1912, Detroit Tigers star Ty Cobb went into the stands and assaulted a fan who had been heckling him. Cobb was suspended by American League President Ban Johnson. The other Tigers refused to play unless Cobb was reinstated. Johnson threatened Tigers owner Frank Navin with a stiff fine if he did not field a team. So Manager Hughie Jennings quickly recruited a pickup team of sandlot players, semi-pro players, and college baseball students.\nThis replacement team played one game, on May 18, 1912, after which the Tigers players relented and returned to play future games (under threat of lifetime banishment).\nThe following players appeared in the May 18, 1912 game, which the Tigers lost to the Philadelphia Athletics, 24–2.\nJoe Sugden and Deacon McGuire were Tigers coaches who had had long baseball careers. This game was their last major league appearance. Hughie Jennings was the Tigers manager; he also had had a long career and was later elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Jennings appeared as pinch hitter in the ninth inning.\nNone of the other players ever appeared in another major league game before or after, except for Billy Maharg, who appeared in one other game as a courtesy in the last game of the 1916 season. Maharg was later deeply involved in the Black Sox Scandal. Jack Smith played two innings in the field, but had no plate appearances and consequently no batting average. Ed Irwin was the only recruit to have a hit (the Tigers coaches each had one). Irwin had two triples, and so retired with a major league batting average of .667 and slugging average of 2.000. Allan Travers's 24 runs allowed is still the American League record for a complete game.\nArthur \"Bugs\" Baer, who later went on to become a noted journalist and humorist, was a member of the team, recruited as a backup bench player. He did not appear in the game."

        "title": "Paul Seymour (basketball)",
        "text": "Paul Norman Seymour (January 30, 1928 – May 5, 1998) was an American professional basketball player and coach. Seymour played college basketball for the Toledo Rockets before playing professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the NBA, he played for the Baltimore Bullets and Syracuse Nationals. While with the Nationals, Seymour was named to the NBA All-Star game in three consecutive years, from 1953-1955. He also coached in the NBA for the Nationals, St. Louis Hawks, Baltimore Bullets, and Detroit Pistons.\nPlaying career.\nA 6'1\" guard, Seymour played collegiately at the University of Toledo, and had a 12-year career in the NBA and its predecessor, the Basketball Association of America (BAA). He played his first season for the Baltimore Bullets of the BAA; the remainder of his career was with the Syracuse Nationals.\nSeymour was named to the All-NBA second team in the 1954–55 and 1954–55 seasons and played in three NBA All-Star Games during his career. He won a championship with the Nationals in the 1954–55 season. For a good part of his career, Seymour was a player-coach for the Nats.\nSeymour still shares, with former teammate Red Rocha, the NBA record for most minutes in a playoff game with 67.\nCoaching career.\nAfter finishing his playing career, Seymour continued a successful coaching career in the NBA, coaching three more teams. Altogether he coached four teams in eight seasons. In 1961, he was the head coach of the Western Division Team in the All Star Game.\nSeymour was mentioned in the ESPN documentary, Black Magic, which told the story of African-Americans and basketball. In a segment about Cleo Hill, it was revealed that during the 1961–62 season, Bob Pettit and Cliff Hagan approached management and complained that Hill was taking too many shots. (Allegedly, this was just a cover-up for their desire to not play with an African-American teammate.) Management granted their wish, telling Seymour to severely diminish Hill's offensive role. Seymour's refusal resulted in his dismissal 14 games into the season on November 17, 1961. His replacement on an interim basis was Pettit. Seymour had no ill feelings towards team owner Ben Kerner, stating, \"He didn't fire me. The players did.\"\nWhile coaching at Baltimore during the 1965–1966 season, Seymour deliberately ended Johnny Kerr's then-record consecutive-games-played streak of 844 games by benching the team captain for one game. According to Kerr, only after the game did Seymour tell Kerr about his intention to end Kerr's streak, saying, \"This will take the pressure off you.\"\nLater years.\nSeymour was featured in the book, Basketball History in Syracuse, Hoops Roots by author Mark Allen Baker published by The History Press in 2010. The book is an introduction to professional basketball in Syracuse and includes teams like (Vic Hanson's) All-Americans, the Syracuse Reds and the Syracuse Nationals (1946–1963).\nSeymour was elected to the first class of the Greater Syracuse Sports Hall of Fame in 1987 along with owner Dan Biasone and NBA all-time great Dolph Schayes."

        "text": "The World Series of Darts was a professional darts tournament held from 19 to 21 May 2006 at the Mohegan Sun Casino, in Uncasville, Connecticut. It was the first and only edition of the competition, which was established by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) to capitalise on the potentially large North American market. It was the second of four PDC non-ranking events in the 2006 season and featured 32 players: 16 American entrants and 16 PDC players. There was a $1,000,000 bonus to the winner of the tournament if they were from the United States.\nPhil Taylor, the 13-time world champion, defeated Adrian Lewis 13 legs to five (13–5) in the final, which was the latter's first appearance in the final of a major broadcast tournament. Before his match with Lewis, Taylor defeated qualifier Tim O'Gorman in the first round, Terry Jenkins in the second round, Mark Dudbridge in the quarter-finals and Ronnie Baxter in the semi-finals. John Part, the two-time world champion, made the tournament's highest checkout, a 161 in leg seven of his first round loss to qualifier and American number one John Kuczynski.\nBackground and format.\nThe World Series of Darts was announced in \"The New York Times\" as a \"made-for-television darts championship\" in October 2005. It was launched in early 2006 by sports promoter and Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) chairperson Barry Hearn, and executive producer Michael Davies. This was done because North America was possibly a large market for darts. The tournament was held from 19 to 21 May 2006, in Uncasville, Connecticut, and was the second of four non-ranking PDC-sanctioned events in the 2006 season. It was the only edition of the competition, which became the US Open in 2007. The competition featured a 32-player main draw held at the Mohegan Sun Casino.\nA total of 16 PDC players automatically qualified for the tournament based on their positions in the PDC world rankings following the 2006 PDC World Darts Championship. There were 16 seeds: Colin Lloyd, the world number one, was the first seed and Phil Taylor, the 13-time world champion, was seeded second. There were 12 places decided by a series of qualifying rounds held between 4 February and 19 April at various locations across the United States. The remaining 4 spots were decided in a competition which took place at the Mohegan Sun Resort on 19 May. The maximum number of legs played in a match increased from 11 in the first and second rounds to 17 in the quarter-finals and 21 in the semi-finals, leading up to the best-of-25 legs final.\nThe tournament was broadcast in the United States on ESPN and ESPN2 as a series of eight one-hour highlight programmes through July to September 2006. In the United Kingdom, Sky Sports broadcast a weekly highlights programme of the event from August to October.\nPrize fund.\nThe event had a total prize fund of $300,000 for all PDC entrants; a special $1,000,000 bonus was put up for an American champion because of British dominance in world darts. A PDC player would earn $100,000 for winning the event. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nQualification.\nEntrants in each of the 12 regional qualifying rounds had to be aged 21 or over and be a citizen of the United States. The qualifying events were staged as single-elimination tournaments and featured a total prize fund of $9,600; $800 was available for each competition. All fixtures was best-of-seven legs with the players throwing for the bullseye ring to determine who would play first should a match enter a seventh, game-ending leg. There were four seeds given to the four highest-ranked participants at each competition, based on the \"Bull's Eye News Pro Rankings\".\nThe two-stage Mohegan Sun tournament \"Friday Night Madness\" was held late on 19 May. Players had to be citizens of the United States and aged 21 or over; those who were in a previous qualifier could enter. A total of 256 competitors played within a 32-board setup in the arena. The first stage saw players attempt to achieve as low a score as possible in the fewest number of throws. The 16 players with the lowest overall scores including tiebreaks advanced to stage two, which was a single-elimination, bracket system and best-of-seven leg matches with no seeds. The four winners of stage two qualified for the main draw.\nTournament summary.\nRound 1.\nThe draw for the first round of the championship was conducted by tournament director Tommy Cox as well as Lloyd and Taylor on 27 April. The first round of the competition, in which 32 players participated, took place on 20 May. Lloyd won 6–2 over Isen Veljic on the double 10 ring after losing the first leg to Veljic.

Agassi was making his tournament debut, and would go on to win three more editions of the tournament in 2000, 2001, and 2003.\nA memorable moment occurred in the quarterfinal match between Sampras and Jim Courier. Sampras had fought from a two-set deficit to level the match at 2–2. Shortly after winning the first game of the fifth set, Sampras was overcome with grief over his then-coach, Tim Gullikson. (Gullikson had suffered several seizures while touring with Sampras in Europe in late 1994. Shortly before Sampras' match against Courier, Gullikson had collapsed during a practice session after suffering another seizure, with tests proving inconclusive at Epworth Hospital and being flown home to Chicago for further tests.) During the fifth set of the match, Sampras retired to his chair and broke down in tears. When he returned, Courier offered to finish the match the next day. Sampras declined and then won the match.

        "title": "Equestrian helmet",
        "text": "An equestrian helmet is a form of protective headgear worn when riding horses. This type of helmet is specially designed to protect the rider's head in the event of falls from a horse, especially from striking a hard object while falling or being accidentally struck in the head by a horse's hoof.\nCertified helmets are required headgear for many competitive riding events, particularly where horse and rider must jump or work at high speed. Helmets are worn more often by English-style riders and are gaining acceptance as required headgear for children and young teens. They are also widely accepted in fields such as horse racing, eventing or show jumping. They are required in eventing, in endurance riding and other types of competitions. People who take their horses hacking or trail riding sometimes wear helmets, though there are tremendous variations in helmet use in different regions and cultures. In the United States, use is by fewer than one in eight riders. Some states, such as Florida and New York, are starting to require by law that riders under the age of 14 wear helmets at equestrian establishments, on public highways and publicly owned land. \nDesign.\nAn equestrian helmet has a hard shell on the outside of an impact-resistant resin or plastic, sometimes covered with cloth for a more attractive look. The brim is particularly flexible and will give way immediately in the event a rider lands on it. Beneath the shell are materials designed to absorb the impact of a fall or blow. The inside is lined and often padded in order to be comfortable for the rider. Ventilation is usually worked into the design, and a harness is attached to keep the helmet on the head at all times.\nEquestrian helmets have sport-specific differences from those used in other sports. For this reason, a helmet designed for another sport, such as bicycle or motorcycle helmet, is not deemed suitable for riding horses. The equestrian helmet covers more of a person's head than does a bicycle helmet, fitting lower on the head, particularly at the back of the skull, and has protection distributed evenly around the head rather than concentrated in the front and top. Aside from safety features, aerodynamics are less important in a riding helmet than in a bicycle or even a motorcycle helmet. The appearance of riding helmets is frequently based on that of an English hunt cap. In addition good ventilation and comfort are considered important features of a riding helmet.\nSome riders feel that riding helmets are hot, uncomfortable or unattractive and do not want to wear them. However, the classic hunt cap, which modern helmets attempt to resemble, offered little or no protection to the rider of the horse. Neither do other types of hats popular with riders, including the derby, cowboy hat and the top hat. Use of helmets by beginning riders is becoming a common requirement, and some liability insurance policies for riding instructors ask the instructor to require their students to wear helmets.\nLaw and rules concerning helmets.\nTypically, helmets must meet one or more specific safety standards to be permitted for use in competition.\nUnited States.\nThe states of Florida and New York have passed legislation requiring the wearing of helmets for riding: In 2009, the state of Florida mandated helmets for youths under the age of 16; New York has had helmet laws affecting youths under the age of 14 under certain circumstances since 1999.\nThe United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) requires that, in classes that mandate a helmet to be worn, the helmet must be ASTM/SEI certified. The USEF also requires all junior riders (under the age of 18) in any hunt seat discipline to wear an ASTM/SEI certified helmet with harness fastened while mounted on their horse anywhere on the show grounds, and requires all riders to wear a helmet when jumping anywhere on the show grounds. The United States Eventing Association (USEA) requires that all competitors have properly fitting headgear that is ASTM/SEI certified as well. While other horse show events do not mandate helmets, the rules have changed in recent years to permit helmets as optional headgear in any class. All riders are required to wear certified helmets while competing in Hunter, Jumpers, and Hunt Seat Equitation classes, and in any other class, including Hunter Hack, where jumping is required. They must fasten their helmet harness and must verify that the helmet meets or exceeds the current standard and carries the SEI tag.\nInternational.\nFor FEI international competition that involves competitors from many different nations, protective headgear complying with the European (EN), British (PAS), North American\n(ASTM), or Australian/New Zealand tested standards is required.\nAesthetic and symbolism.\nRiding helmets traditionally reflect the conservative style of dress that characterized earlier non-protective English riding headwear. The classic riding helmet is covered in black velvet or velveteen (either via a removable cover or permanently glued on), with a small, flexible, visor-style brim.\nMore recently, smooth finish helmets worn without a fabric cover, have become more common. A newly popular style in the hunter-jumper world features a lightly textured (less shiny) plastic shell with a decorative ventilation strip down the center. This design goes by many brand names, but, due to the ventilation strip, is informally called a \"skunk helmet.\"\nJockeys who ride race horses wear a helmet designed without a brim, adding a colorful cover that is part of the owners’ racing colors, with a false brim for appearance's sake. Use of racing style colored helmet covers has spread to other disciplines, especially amongst Eventers. Casual riders often wear \"training\" or \"schooling\" helmets in a variety of colors and some even include patterns (such as stars or stripes). Cloth covers in brilliant colors and vivid designs can be purchased to provide even more variety, but are frowned upon (and are sometimes illegal) in the horse show ring, where black, brown or gray are still the standard.\nThere are helmet designs that resemble a cowboy hat, or have other \"western\" styling, such as a tan color, or a cordura outer cover. But adoption by western riders has been particularly slow, especially in the United States, where helmets are seen mostly in trail riding, competitive trail riding, and endurance riding, and seldom at rodeos (where use would be particularly well-advised) or in western-style horse show classes.\nSome helmets retain a symbolic ribbon at the back, which dates from mounted hunting. Traditionally, black ribbon was used for fox hunting or general hunting, with red ribbon used when stag hunting or \"arme blanche\" hunting. The ribbon was \"sewn up\" (i.e. with a bow at the base of the helmet and the tail ends of the ribbon either cut off or glued pointing upwards on the body of the helmet) for \"common\" riders. The ribbon was \"sewn down\" (i.e. with the tail ends dangling from the bow, below the edge of the helmet) for hunt masters and hunt staff. Because any rider is entitled to wear a sewn up black ribbon, this is the standard for modern helmets retaining the ribbon. The use of \"sewn down\" ribbons by those not entitled to them sometimes occurs in the United States but is considered a serious transgression by traditionalists.\nIn some nations, members of the cavalry wear silver ribbons and national athletes wear gold ribbons. The ribbons are sewn up for troopers and common riders, and sewn down for officers and riders who have represented their countries at the Olympics or championships such as the World Equestrian Games.\nStandards.\nHelmets must meet a defined standard to be certified for use in competition. Procedures vary from one nation to the next. However, as a general rule, the design standards are created by a standards organization that has knowledge of hazards in the field of activity, and then actual helmets are tested and certified by a separate Conformity assessment organization with testing expertise.\nThe testing standards in the United States and New Zealand are considered more rigorous than those in other nations. \nIndependent testing in the United Kingdom in 2003 by the British Equestrian Trade Association found a number of “traditional” designs from the three most established and respected British manufacturers failed a series of tests intended to determine if a design provided proper protection in the event of a fall.\nConformity assessment.\nConformity assessment organizations that certify safety equipment perform some similar tests on all protective helmets (including bicycle, hockey and equestrian helmets), such as dropping them onto a flat anvil from a height of about six feet from several angles and directions. However, other tests are designed to consider the particular risks of a given sport. For equestrian helmets, these other tests may include dropping the helmet onto an anvil with a sharp edge, to simulate impact with the edge of a jump standard or a horse hoof.\nUnited States.\nThe most common standard used by sanctioning organizations in the United States is known as ASTM F1163 It is periodically updated, the most recent is ASTM F1163-13 (2013). It is a performance standard written by a volunteer committee of \"producers\" (persons who represent manufacturing companies) and \"users\" of equestrian helmets, and published by ASTM International. The standard defines performance criteria and test methods; it does not prescribe helmet design. This is the current standard adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\nIn the United States, conformity assessment of riding helmets to defined standards is performed primarily by the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI). Helmet manufacturers voluntarily provide samples of each model and size of helmet to the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI) for simulated crash testing using the test methods defined by the ASTM standard. If the samples pass the tests, the producers may label other helmets of the same model and size to indicate that the helmet is ASTM/SEI certified. SEI also monitors the market for helmets fraudulently labeled as being ASTM/SEI certified; for this purpose, SEI publishes a list of all the helmet models and sizes which it has certified.\nOther United States standards.\nThe Snell Memorial Foundation, best known for its safety testing standards for motorcycle helmets, also publishes a safety testing standard for Equestrian helmets, E2001. However, no national sanctioning equestrian organization to date has adopted the Snell standard, the ASTM standard is more generally used.\nUnited Kingdom.\nProduct Approved Specification (PAS) 015 is one British safety standard for equestrian helmets. It defines test methods to evaluate shock absorption, penetration resistance, strength and effectiveness of retention system, durability of quick release mechanisms, and deflection of the peak. The other standard is BS EN 1384:1997 The EN 1384 and PAS 015:1998 are now essentially the same. Conformity assessment in the UK for the EN 1384 and ASTM F1163 standards is performed by INSPEC \nEurope.\nEuropean Normes EN 1384 (Helmets for Equestrian Activities) and EN 14572 (High Performance Helmets for Equestrian Activities) are standards published by the Centre for European Normes in Brussels, and widely used for purposes of conformity assessment in Europe. The codes for EN standards is sometimes prefixed by other codes to indicate adoption by national standards organizations. For example, the acronym “DIN” is used to indicate the Deutsches Institut für Normung, and “BS” indicates a standard adopted in the UK.\nAustralia/New Zealand.\nThe helmet standard in Australian and New Zealand standard is AS/NZ 3838:2006.\nInternational.\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide 65:1996 is a widely respected international best practices standard for entities operating certification programs such as SEI and INSPEC.\nStandards compared.\nMore recent versions of PAS 015:1998 and BS EN 1384:1997 are nearly identical. In contrast, ASTM F1163 and PAS 015 are not identical, though a series of tests in 1999 indicated that in some cases, the ASTM standard in use at that time was marginally superior. On the other hand, the current debate between the ASTM standard and the EN standard is primarily over the issue of ventilation slots, allowed by ASTM. The debate centers over whether there is an actual need for protection from penetration by sharp objects.\nThe SEI is accredited to ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standards Council of Canada (SCC). This means that SEI is one of several testing programs that complies with the guidelines of the ISO."

        "title": "Figure skating at the Olympic Games",
        "text": "Figure skating was first contested in the Olympic Games at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Since 1924, the sport has been a part of the Winter Olympic Games.\nMen's singles, ladies' singles, and pair skating have been held most often. Ice dance joined as a medal sport in 1976 and a team event debuted at the 2014 Olympics. Special figures were contested at only one Olympics, in 1908. Synchronized skating has never appeared at the Olympics but aims to be included.\nHistory.\nFigure skating was first contested as an Olympic sport at the 1908 Summer Olympics, in London, United Kingdom. As this traditional winter sport could be conducted indoors, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved its inclusion in the Summer Olympics program. It was featured a second time at the Antwerp Games, after which it was permanently transferred to the program of the Winter Olympic Games, first held in 1924 in Chamonix, France.\nIn London, figure skating was presented in four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's special figures, and mixed pairs. The special figures contest was won by Russian Nikolai Panin, who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal. He remains the event's sole winner, as it was subsequently dropped from the program.\nIce dance joined as a medal sport in 1976, after appearing as a demonstration event at Grenoble 1968.\nA team event debuted at the 2014 Olympics. It consists of two segments: qualification and finals. During qualification each team has one men's single skater, one ladies' single skater, one pair, and one ice dance couple skate their short program/dance. Before the finals, each team is allowed to replace up to two skaters/couples. The final consists of each skater/couple skating their free program/dance. Results are determined by placement points.\nQualifying.\nThe number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic Committee. There are 30 participants in each singles events (ladies and men), 20 pairs, and 24 ice dance duos.\nIn the past, skaters must represent a member nation of the International Skating Union and reach the age of fifteen before July 1 of the previous year. After the previous 2022 Olympic Games, this rule has changed and the new age requirement by the next Olympics will be 17-years-old. They are also required to be citizens of the country they are representing. Competitors have until just before the Olympics to receive citizenship. Since nationality rules are less strict for the ISU Championships, sometimes skaters who have competed at World or European championships are not eligible for the Olympics.\n80% of the Olympic spots (24 men/ladies, 19 dance couples, 16 pairs) are allotted to countries according to the results of the previous year's World Figure Skating Championships. A country may have a maximum of three entries per discipline. Countries earn two or three entries by earning points through their skaters' placements. The points are equal to the sum of the placements of the country's skaters (top two if they have three). If a country only has one skater/couple, that skater/couple must place in the top ten to earn two entries and in the top two to earn three entries. If a country has two skaters/teams, the combined placement of those teams must be 13 or less to qualify 3 entries, and 28 or less to qualify two entries. The remaining places are awarded to one skater/couple each from countries that failed to get multiple places, in order of their skaters' placement in the world championships.\nFollowing the World Championships, countries that have not qualified an entry in a particular discipline receive another opportunity in an international competition held in the autumn (usually the Nebelhorn Trophy) prior to the Olympic Games. Six spots are available in men's singles, six in ladies' singles, four in pairs, and five in ice dance. At some Olympics, the host country is automatically entitled to one entry in each discipline, e.g. in 1994, 2010, and 2018 if minimum scores are achieved. If a country receives a spot by being the host, one fewer spot is available in the autumn qualifying competition.\nThe selection of representatives is at the national governing body's discretion. Some countries rely on the results of their national championships while others have more varied criteria. This may include reaching a certain placement at the European Figure Skating Championships and the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships.\nScoring and judging system.\nA very specific scoring system is used for every discipline in the Olympics. This is referred to as the International Judging System (IJS). Competitors are scored on the technical score and the program components. Each technical element that is attempted in a program has a specific base value of points, which varies based on the element. Additionally, elements such as spins and step sequences can achieve different levels, which can add or subtract points from that element's final score. At the end of the program, all of the competitors' technical element points are added up to form their technical scores. The program components are determined by the overall presentation of a performance and are separated into five categories. The categories consist of skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation of the music. Again, these categories are added together at the end of the program to determine the program components score. The technical elements score and the program components score are added together to create a final segment score.  \nThe judging system consists of two parts, the technical panel and the judges. The technical panel involves five people that play different roles in judging the technical elements of a skaters program. First, there is the technical specialist, who uses the rules developed by the International Skating Union to identify each element and its level of difficulty. The two judges who support the main technical specialist are referred to as the technical controllers and assistant technical specialist. They make sure the primary specialist has correctly identified the elements and make any final decisions on the technical elements presented in the program. The final two roles presented by the technical panel are the data operator and video replay operator. Separate from the technical panel is the judging panel, which is made up of nine judges. Their job is to judge the quality of each element done by the skater regarding the technical elements, as well as evaluate the program components shown in the program. They do this by a great of execution score, GOE, that ranges from –5 to +5 and determines how many points can be added or subtracted from the base value of an element.\nAge rules.\nWithin figure skating, there is a set minimum age limit for all elite competitors through the sport. This age was formerly 15 years old, until after the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing. During this event, 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was the favorite to win the ladies' single event, until she was found to have a positive drug test for a banned substance previous to the competition. The International Olympic Committee had to conduct an investigation into Valieva during the Olympics, which brought a great amount of chaos and controversy as to whether she should have been allowed to compete or not. More importantly, it brought attention to the conditions young athletes are faced with physically, mentally, and emotionally as they are preparing for this event, this not being the first time a situation such as this has occurred. After the 2022 Games, the International Skating Union voted to increase the minimum age limit for elite competitors throughout the sport to 17, by a vote of 100 to 16. This limit will be implemented over the course of the next three years, before the 2026 Games in Milan. This decision was based on preserving the physical, mental, and emotional health and wellbeing of figure skaters, and can be summarize by Eric Radford, three time Canadian Olympic medalist, who stated, \"Is a medal worth risking the health of a child or young athlete?\"\nSynchronized skating in the Olympics.\nThe discipline of synchronized skating adds a team element to figure skating, having eight to twenty skaters on the ice at once. They skate together in unison performing difficult step sequences and formations together. This discipline has not yet been included in the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) determines whether to add a sport or a discipline to the Olympics based on how many athletes and officials would be included, how popular the sport is, and how much money it would bring to them. The ISU has been making efforts the past several years to \"investigate, strategize and gather the information required for Synchronized Skating to be accepted as an Olympic discipline.\" \nMedal table.\n\"Accurate as of 2022 Winter Olympics.\"\nParticipating nations.\nThe number in each box represents the number of figure skaters the nation sent.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

Armstrong is also the college basketball analyst for TSN and a former college basketball coach.\nPersonal.\nArmstrong is the son of Irish immigrants and was raised Catholic. His father, who was from Castlebar, County Mayo, died when Jack was age seven and his mother Mary raised him alone. Armstrong graduated from Fordham University in 1988 with a master's in Communication. He has three brothers: William, James and Brendan.\nJack is married to Dena Armstrong, who was the women's soccer coach at Niagara University. They met at Niagara University, when they were both coaches. They are the parents of three adopted sons. They live in Lewiston, New York just across the Niagara River from Ontario.\nArmstrong is a fan of the Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres and the Toronto Raptors.\nCoaching career.\nFrom 1989 to 1998, Armstrong was the lead basketball coach of Niagara University. In the 1992–93 season, he led the Niagara Purple Eagles to a 23–7 record and was named the New York State Division I Coach of the Year. His overall record with the team was 100-154. \nBroadcast career.\nArmstrong is currently an NBA analyst for TSN and the on-air in-game broadcaster for the Toronto Raptors NBA team. He has been a part of the broadcast team since 1998. Armstrong has two catch-phrases that he uses during game broadcasts: \"Helloooo\" and \"Get that garbage outta here\". The \"get that garbage outta here\" phrase was also used by Armstrong in commercials for the City of Toronto government to encourage keeping garbage out of recycling materials. Most recently, following the Raptors’ signings of Montreal natives Chris Boucher and Khem Birch, he would use “Bonjour” instead of \"Helloooo\" whenever a big play such as a block or dunk would be made by those players.\nArmstrong is a 3 time winner of the Canadian Screen Award for Best Sports Analyst in a Sports Program or Series.\nOn Thursday, July 31, 2008, it was announced that Jack Armstrong would take over \"The Chuck Swirsky Show\" effective August 18, 2008, alongside Doug MacLean on the Toronto, Ontario AM sports talk radio station The Fan 590.

        "title": "American football positions",
        "text": "In American football, the specific role that a player takes on the field is referred to as their \"position\". Under the modern rules of American football, both teams are allowed 11 players on the field at one time and have \"unlimited free substitutions\", meaning that they may change any number of players during any \"dead ball\" situation. This has resulted in the development of three task-specific \"platoons\" of players within any single team: the offense (the team with possession of the ball, which is trying to score), the defense (the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them), and \"special teams\" (who play in all kicking situations). Within these three separate \"platoons\", various positions exist depending on the jobs that the players are doing.\nOffense.\nIn American football, the offense is the team that has possession of the ball and is advancing toward the opponent's end zone to score points. The eleven players of the offense can be separated into two main groups: the five offensive linemen, whose primary job is to block opponents and protect their quarterback, and the other six backs and receivers, whose primary job is to move the ball down the field by either running with it or passing it.\nThe organization of the offense is strictly mandated by the rules of the sport: there must be at least seven players on the line of scrimmage and no more than four players (known collectively as \"backs\") behind it. The only players eligible to handle the ball during a normal play are the backs and the two players on the end of the line (the \"ends\"). These players make up the \"skill positions\" and are also referred to as \"eligible receivers\" or \"eligible ball carriers\". The remaining players (known as \"interior linemen\") are \"ineligible\" to catch forward passes. Within these strictures, however, creative coaches have developed a wide array of offensive formations to take advantage of different player skills and game situations.\nThe following positions are standard in nearly every game, though different teams will use different arrangements of them, dependent on their individual game plans.\nOffensive (interior) line (IOL).\nThe offensive line is primarily responsible for blocking the defensive line of the opposition, in order to protect their own quarterback. During normal play, offensive linemen do not handle the ball (aside from the snap from center), unless the ball is fumbled by a ball carrier, a pass is deflected, or a player who is normally an offensive lineman takes a different position on the field. The offensive line consists of:\nCenter (C).\nThe center is the player who begins the play from scrimmage by snapping the ball to the quarterback. As the name suggests, the center usually plays in the middle of the offensive line, though some teams may employ an unbalanced line where the center is offset to one side. Like all offensive linemen, the center has the responsibility to block defensive players. The center often also has the responsibility to call out blocking assignments and make last second adjustments depending on the defensive alignment.\nOffensive guard (OG).\nTwo guards line up directly on opposite sides of the center. Like all interior linemen, their function is to block on both running and passing plays. On some plays, rather than blocking straight ahead, a guard will \"pull\", whereby the guard comes out of their position in line to lead block for a ball carrier, on plays known as \"traps\" (for inside runs), \"sweeps\" (for outside runs), and \"screens\" (for passing plays). In such cases, the guard is referred to as a \"pulling guard\".\nOffensive tackle (OT).\nTwo tackles play outside of the guards. Their role is primarily to block on both running and passing plays. The area from one tackle to the other is an area of \"close line play\" in which blocks from behind, which are prohibited elsewhere on the field, are allowed. For a right-handed quarterback, the left tackle is charged with protecting the quarterback from being hit from behind (known as the \"blind side\"), and this is usually the most skilled player on the offensive line. Like a guard, the tackle may have to \"pull\", on a running play, when there is a tight end on their side. Tackles typically have a taller, longer build than interior offensive linemen, due to the need to keep separation from defensive linemen in pass blocking situations. They also tend to have quick footwork skills as they often engage against containing or rushing defensive ends. \nBacks and receivers (R).\nFour backs line up behind the line of scrimmage. Additionally, there are two receivers, one on each end of the line of scrimmage, who line up outside of the interior linemen. There are four main positions in this set of players:\nQuarterback (QB).\nThe quarterback is the player who receives the ball from the center to start the play. Considered the most influential position on the offensive side because his team's progress down the field is dependent on his success, the quarterback is responsible for receiving the play from the coaches on the sideline and communicating the play to the other offensive players in the huddle, and serves as the leader of the team's passing game. The quarterback may need to make late changes to the intended play at the line of scrimmage (known as an \"audible\") depending on the defensive alignment. At the start of the play, the quarterback may be lined up in one of three positions. If he is positioned directly behind and in contact with the center and receives the ball via the direct hand-to-hand pass, he is said to be \"under center\". Alternatively, if he is lined up some distance behind the center, he is said to be either in \"shotgun formation\" or in \"pistol formation\" ('shotgun' is generally further back than 'pistol'). Upon receiving the ball from the center, the quarterback has three basic options to advance the ball: he may run the ball himself (most commonly referred to as scrambling), he may hand it to another eligible ball carrier to run with it, or he may execute a forward pass to a player further up the field.\nRunning back (RB/HB/FB).\nRunning backs are players who line up behind the offensive line in a position to receive a hand-off from the quarterback and execute a rushing play. Anywhere from one to three running backs may be utilized on a play (or none, which is referred to as an \"empty backfield\"). Depending on where they line up and what role they have, running backs come in several varieties. The \"tailback\", also known as the \"halfback\", is often a team's primary ball carrier on rushing plays. They may also catch passes, often acting as a \"check-down\" or \"safety valve\" when all other receivers on a pass play are covered. The \"fullback\" is often larger and stronger than the tailback and acts primarily as a blocker, though the fullback may also be used for catching passes or for rushing as a tailback does. Fullbacks often line up closer to the line of scrimmage than tailbacks do in order to block for them on rushing plays. A \"wing-back\" or a \"slot-back\" is a term for a running back who lines up behind the line of scrimmage outside the tackle or tight end on either side of the offensive line. Slot-backs are usually only found in certain offensive alignments, such as the flexbone formation. There also exists a similar position, known as the \"H-back\", that is actually considered a modification of the normal tight end position.\nWide receiver (WR).\nWide receivers are pass-catching specialists. Typically fast and tall, their main job is to run pass routes and get open (i.e. find a position with no near defender) for passes, although they are occasionally called on to block. Wide receivers generally line up split \"wide\" near the sidelines at the start of the play. Wide receivers, like running backs, come in different varieties depending on exactly where they line up. A wide receiver who is directly on the line of scrimmage is called a \"split end\" and is counted among the seven required players on the line of scrimmage. A wide receiver who lines up behind the line (and thus counts as one of the four backs) is called the \"flanker\". A wide receiver who lines up between the outermost wide receiver and the offensive line is said to be \"in the slot\" and is called the \"slot receiver\". A wide receiver who can play running back is called a wide back.\nTight end (TE).\nTight ends play on either side of the offensive line and directly next to the tackles. Tight ends are considered \"hybrid players\" because they are a cross between a wide receiver and an offensive lineman. Because they play next to the other offensive linemen, they are very frequently called on to block, especially on running plays. However, because they are eligible receivers, they may also catch passes. The position known as the \"H-back\" is a tight end who lines up behind the line of scrimmage, and is thus counted as one of the four \"backs\", but their role is otherwise similar to that of other tight ends.\nDepending on the style of offense the coaches have designed, the game situation, and the relative skill sets of the players, teams may run formations that contain any number of running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends, so long as the mandated \"four backs and seven on the line\" rule is followed. For many years, the standard set consisted of the quarterback, two running backs (a tailback/halfback and a fullback), two wide receivers (a flanker and a split end) and a tight end. Modern teams show a wide variety of formations, from a \"full house\" formation with three running backs, two tight ends, and no wide receivers, to \"spread\" formations featuring four or five wide receivers and either one or no running backs.\nDefense.\nThe defensive team, simply known as the \"defense\", is the team that begins a play from scrimmage without possession of the ball. The objective of the defensive team is to prevent the other team from scoring and win possession of the ball for their side. The defense accomplishes this by forcing the offense to turn the ball over by either preventing them from achieving a first down and forcing them to punt, forcing and recovering an offensive fumble, intercepting a pass, or more rarely, forcing a turnover on downs.\nUnlike the offensive team, the rules of the sport do not restrict the defensive team into certain positions. A defensive player may line up anywhere on his side of the line of scrimmage and perform any legal action. Over time, however, defensive roles have become defined into three main sets of players that encompass several individual positions.\nDefensive line (DL).\nLike their offensive counterparts, defensive linemen (also called rushers) line up directly on the line of scrimmage. There are three positions usually considered part of the defensive line:\nDefensive tackle (DT);.\nSometimes called a \"defensive guard\", defensive tackles play at the center of the defensive line. Their function is to rush the passer and stop running plays directed at the middle of the line of scrimmage. Most defensive sets have one or two defensive tackles. If one employs a second defensive tackle, sometimes referred to as an \"under tackle\", they are usually a bit faster than the nose tackle.\nNose tackle (NT);.\nSometimes called a \"middle guard\", or \"nose guard\", nose tackles play in the center of the defensive line. Their function is to clog the middle of the offense's line and stop most run plays (more commonly fullback dives, plunges and sneaks). They line up directly in front of the offenses center, almost nose-to-nose, hence the name. This position is used in 3-4 formations, or goal line situations.\nMost nose tackles are 320-350 pounds, and are the biggest players on the roster. This position is the most physically demanding, due to being forced into constant double or triple teams, and needing enough speed to collapse the interior of the offensive line. Sometimes, nose tackles are used in 4-3 defenses and are either positioned on the quarterbacks blind side, or directly in front of the center.\nDefensive end (DE).\nDefensive ends line up outside of the defensive tackles and are the \"ends\" of the defensive line. Their function is to attack the passer or stop offensive runs to the outer edges of the line of scrimmage, which is often referred to as \"containment\". The faster of the two is usually placed on the right side of the defensive line (quarterback's left) because that is a right-handed quarterback's blind side.\nDefensive linemen will often take a stance with one or both of their hands on the ground before the ball is snapped. These are known as a \"three-point stance\" and \"four-point stance\" respectively, and this helps distinguish a defensive lineman from a linebacker, who begins in a two-point stance (i.e. without a hand touching the ground).\nLinebackers (LB).\nLinebackers play behind the defensive line and perform various duties depending on the situation, including rushing the passer, covering receivers, and defending against the run.\nMiddle linebacker (MLB).\nSometimes called the \"inside linebacker\" (especially in a 3–4 defense), and known colloquially as the \"Mike\" linebacker, the middle linebacker is often known as the \"quarterback of the defense\", as they are frequently the primary defensive play callers and must react to a wide variety of situations. Middle linebackers must be capable of stopping running backs who make it past the defensive line, covering pass plays over the middle, and rushing the quarterback on blitz plays.\nOutside linebacker (OLB).\nOutside linebackers are given different names depending on their role and the philosophy of the team. Some teams keep their outside linebackers on the same side of the field at all times while others define them as playing on either the \"strongside\" (SLB) or the \"weakside\" (WLB). The strongside, or \"Sam\", linebacker lines up on the same side as the offensive tight end and often is responsible for covering the tight end or running back on pass plays. The weakside, or \"Will\", linebacker lines up on the side of the offensive line without a tight end and is often used to rush, or blitz, the quarterback or to cover a running back on pass plays. Some are occasionally referred to as edge rushers.\nDefensive backs (DB).\nDefensive backs, also known as the \"secondary\", play either behind the linebackers or outside near the sidelines and are primarily used to defend against pass plays. They also act as the last line of defense on running plays and need to be able to make open field tackles, especially when the ball carrier has gotten past the other defenders. A normal defensive lineup includes two cornerbacks and two safeties, though specialty defensive backs (nickelbacks and dime backs) can be brought in in place of linebackers and defensive linemen when there is a need to cover additional receivers.\nCornerback (CB).\nCornerbacks attempt to prevent successful passes by either swatting the airborne ball away from the receiver or by catching the pass themselves. In rushing situations, their job is to contain the runner, either by directing them back to the middle of the field to be tackled by the middle line backers, or by forcing them out of bounds.\nSafety (S).\nThe safeties are the last line of defense (furthest from the line of scrimmage) and usually help the corners with deep-pass coverage. The \"strong safety\" (SS) is usually the larger and stronger of the two, providing extra protection against run plays by standing closer to the line of scrimmage, usually on the strong (tight end) side of the field. The \"free safety\" (FS) is usually the smaller and faster of the two, and is usually the deepest player on the defense, providing help on long pass plays.\nNickelback and dimeback.\nIn certain formations, the defense may remove a linebacker or a defensive lineman to bring in extra pass coverage in the form of extra defensive backs. A formation with five defensive backs is often called a \"nickel\" formation, and the fifth (extra) defensive back is called a \"nickelback\" after the U.S. nickel coin, a five-cent piece. By extension, a formation with a sixth defensive back (dimeback) is called a \"dime package\" because it employs a second nickelback and the U.S. 10-cent dime coin is equal to two nickels. Although it is a rare occurrence, a team may also use seven or eight defensive backs on a play, as well.\nDefensive formations are often known by a numerical code indicating the number of players at each position. The two most common formations are the 3–4 defense and the 4–3 defense, where the first number refers to the number of defensive linemen, and the second number refers to the number of linebackers (the number of defensive backs can be inferred, since there must be eleven players on the field). Thus, a 3–4 defense consists of three defensive linemen (usually a nose tackle and two defensive ends), four linebackers, and four defensive backs (two cornerbacks, a strong safety, and a free safety).\nSpecial teams.\nSpecial teams are units that are on the field during kicking plays. While many players who appear on offensive or defensive squads also play similar roles on special teams (offensive linemen to block or defensive players to tackle), there are some specialist roles that are unique to the kicking game.\nKicking specialists.\nKicking specialists are in charge of kicking the football. Depending on the type of specialist and the play that was called, the responsibilities of these positions vary.\nKicker (K).\nAlso called a \"placekicker\", kickers handle kickoffs, extra points, and field goals. All three situations require the kicker to kick the ball off the ground, either from the hands of a holder or off of a tee. Some teams employ two kickers: one kicks extra points and field goals, and the other, known as a \"kickoff specialist\", handles kickoffs. Most, however, use a single kicker for both jobs, and rarely, the same player may also punt.\nKickoff specialist (KOS).\nKickoff specialists are the kickers of kickoffs. In most cases, the kickoff specialist is also the placekicker, and sometimes the punter. Teams may employ pure kickoff specialists if they feel neither their kicker nor punter is good enough at kickoffs. Due to their specialized nature and the limited number of active roster spots, professional full-time KOSs are rare.\nPunter (P).\nThe punter usually lines up 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage. However, this distance has to be shortened when it would result in being on or behind the end line. After receiving the snap, the punter drops the football and kicks, or \"punts\", it from the air in order to relinquish possession to the defensive team and to send the ball as far downfield as possible. This is usually done only on fourth down.\nOther special teams positions.\nAlmost all other special teams positions double as backups for skill positions.\nHolder (H).\nThe holder is usually positioned 7–8 yards from the line of scrimmage and holds the ball for the placekicker to kick. The player occupying this position is often a backup quarterback or a punter because of their \"good hands\", feel for the ball, and experience taking snaps from a long snapper or center during plays from scrimmage. A holder is occasionally used on kickoffs if the weather or field conditions repeatedly cause the ball to fall off the tee.\nLong snapper (LS).\nThe long snapper is a specialized center who snaps the ball directly to the holder or punter. They are usually distinct from a regular center, as the ball often has to be snapped much farther back on kicking plays than on standard offensive plays. Long snappers are generally the size of tight ends or linebackers, as they not only have to be big enough to block for the punter or kicker, but also athletic enough to run down the field on coverage to try and tackle the return man. In the past, long snappers were often backup players, but nowadays this position is usually played by dedicated long snappers.\nKick returner (KR) and punt returner (PR).\nReturners are responsible for catching kicked balls (either on kickoffs or punts) and running the ball back. These are usually among the fastest players on a team and typically play either wide receiver or cornerback, as well. However, due to the relatively high likelihood of injury during kick returns, most professional teams will not regularly use their very best WRs or CBs as returners. Teams may also use the same player for both return positions or have a specific returner for punts and another for kickoffs.\nUpback/Personal protector.\nThe upback, also known as the personal protector, is a blocking back who lines up approximately 1–3 yards behind the line of scrimmage in punting situations. Because the punter plays so far back, the back frequently makes the line calls and lets the long snapper know when the punter is ready to receive the ball. Their primary role is to act as the last line of defense for the punter; however, upbacks occasionally receive the snap instead on fake punts and will either pass or run with the football in those situations. Upbacks are usually played by backup running backs or linebackers. The upback, along with the punter, are usually the last lines of defense to prevent an opponent from returning a punt for a touchdown.\nGunner.\nA gunner is a player on kickoffs and punts who specializes in running down the field very quickly in an attempt to tackle the returner. They usually line up near the sidelines where there will be fewer blockers which allows them to get down the field quickly. Wide receivers and cornerbacks often fill the role as gunner.\nJammer.\nJammers try to slow down gunners during punts or kickoffs so the returners have more time to move down the field."

        "title": "Throwing (cricket)",
        "text": "Throwing, commonly referred to as chucking, is an illegal bowling action in the sport of cricket. This occurs when a bowler straightens the bowling arm when delivering the ball. Throws are not allowed when a bowler bowls to a batsman. If the umpire deems that the ball has been thrown, they will call a no-ball, which means the batsman cannot be given out from that delivery. \nAfter biomechanical testing showed that all bowlers flex their extended arms to some degree, rules were changed. Current regulations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) set a limit of 15 degrees of permissible straightening of the elbow joint for all bowlers in international cricket. This law applies between the point at which the bowling arm passes above shoulder height and the point at which the ball is released. The limit is to allow only the natural flexing of the elbow joint which happens during the course of legal delivery.\nThe charge of 'throwing' against a bowler is one of the most serious and controversial that can be made in cricket, as a bowler with an illegal action must take steps to correct their action or face being banned from the game.\nOverview.\nLaw 21, Clause 2 defines a fair delivery with respect to the arm:\nHistory.\nBefore the advent of developed biomechanical and audiovisual technology, Law 24 Clause 3 was implemented by the field umpires, who judged a delivery as illegal or \"thrown\" on visual judgement alone. The law against throwing has not changed in its essence since overarm bowling was legalised in 1864.\n1800s.\nTom Wills, Australia's most revered cricketer of the mid-19th century, was also its most controversial. He was often accused of throwing and later even admitted to it. Many of his contemporaries recalled his trickery: \"[Wills] used to say to the umpire, 'Just look at my feet, will you; I have a bad habit now and then of going over the crease.' The umpire would look at Tom's feet, and Tom would let go a throw for all he was worth.\" In 1872 Wills became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a major Australian match, effectively ending his first-class career.\nIn the early 1880s there were a number of bowlers who were widely considered to have unfair actions, with the Lancashire pair of Jack Crossland and George Nash coming in for particular criticism. After playing for Kent against Lancashire in 1885, when he faced the bowling of Crossland and Nash, Lord Harris decided to take action. He persuaded the Kent committee to cancel the return fixture. Later that season, Crossland was found to have broken his residential qualification for Lancashire by living in Nottinghamshire and Nash dropped out of the side. Thus the two counties resumed playing each other the following season. Harris's \"Wisden\" obituarist wrote: \"there can be no doubt the action of Lord Harris, even if it did not entirely remove the throwing evil, had a very healthy effect on the game.\"\nSydney Pardon, the editor of \"Wisden\", accused quick bowler Ernest Jones of throwing during Australia's tour of England in 1896 but it was left to an Australian umpire, Jim Phillips, to \"call\" Jones for throwing in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The same umpire ended the great C. B. Fry's bowling career by calling him for throwing. Pardon considered the end of the career of the famous Corinthian bowler \"a case of long-delayed justice\".\nPhillips went on to call Lancashire and England fast bowler Arthur Mold in 1900 and 1901, all but ending his productive career. Mold took 1,673 wickets in first-class cricket at only 15.54 apiece, bowling at high pace with a sharp 'break back' from just a four pace run up, but his bowling had always attracted as much controversy as praise. He took 192 wickets in 1895 and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1892 but he left the first-class scene after the 1901 season and Phillips' intervention.\nEarly 1900s.\nThe Australian aboriginal fast bowler Eddie Gilbert was another fast bowler who generated extreme pace from a remarkably short run. Standing tall and in weight he took wickets at a prodigious rate in the late 1920s in Queensland club cricket. He was chosen for Queensland against New South Wales Colts in 1930 and took 6 wickets but the Brisbane Courier's correspondent \"Long On\" was moved to describe his whipped catapult action as \"almost a throw\". He was picked for Queensland's Sheffield Shield side and bowled with great success. Queensland selectors responded to complaints from New South Wales by filming his arm action in slow motion but took no action against him. His most famous spell came against Don Bradman on 6 November 1931. He dismissed the NSW opener with his first ball, a vicious bouncer, then knocked Bradman's bat out of his hands with the next. The next delivery knocked Bradman over and the third had him caught behind. A month later, playing against Victoria, he was repeatedly called for throwing. He played on for Queensland, bowling at a reduced pace, and in 1934–35 headed the Queensland averages. He was a victim of legislation outlawing intimidatory bowling, in the wake of the Bodyline affair and retired in 1936, having taken 87 first-class wickets at 29.21.\n1950s.\nAn epidemic of throwing plagued cricket in the 1950s. Umpire Frank Chester wanted to no-ball the South African Cuan McCarthy for throwing in 1951 but was blocked by the authorities at Lords, Plum Warner commenting diplomatically \"These people are our guests\".\nSurrey and England left-arm spinner Tony Lock was generally thought to throw his dangerous faster ball; on one occasion Doug Insole inquired if he had been 'bowled or run out' after Lock had shattered his stumps. He was in fact called for throwing in county cricket early in his career, and is said to have cleaned up his action towards the end of his career after seeing a bowler on video, commenting on how poor the bowler's action was and being shocked to discover it was himself.\nLeft-arm paceman Ian Meckiff helped Australia to regain the Ashes in 1958–59 but feelings ran high in the England team and press that Meckiff and others had bowled outside the laws and spirit of the game. (Meckiff was also alleged – along with several other Australia bowlers – to be breaking the spirit of the no-ball law by \"dragging\" – grounding the back foot behind the bowling crease, thus making the delivery legal, but dragging it through so that it was considerably in front of the crease before the front foot landed, thus bowling from illegally close to the batsman. Following arguments over this, the no-ball law was changed to rely on the bowler's front foot being grounded behind the popping crease, rather than the back foot being grounded behind the bowling crease.) Elder statesmen on both sides, including Gubby Allen and Don Bradman, resolved to clear the air before Australia's tour of England in 1961. In 1963–64, Meckiff was called by Colin Egar in the First Test against South Africa in Brisbane, ending his career.\nTwenty-one-year-old South African Geoff Griffin, who had already been called when playing for Natal, was called in May 1960 while playing against MCC at Lords and his test career was ended by umpire Frank Lee who called him four times during the Second Test. Remarkably he claimed a hat trick during the test but South Africa lost by an innings, prompting an exhibition match to be staged as the Queen was due to visit the ground. Griffin was called by umpire Syd Buller, ending an over bowling underarm when he was no-balled again for not informing the umpire of a change of action.\nWest Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith, perhaps the most feared fast bowler of his generation, was often suspected of throwing his faster ball although he was not called in Test matches and the promising career of Derbyshire's Harold Rhodes was stunted by constant speculation about the legality of his action. He was 'called' while playing against the South African tourists in 1960 by Paul Gibb but though he was eventually cleared and played on with great success for Derbyshire through the decade, he played just twice for England.\n1990s.\nIn more recent times bowlers such as England's James Kirtley, Australia's Brett Lee and Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar and Shabbir Ahmed have come under scrutiny to varying degrees.\nMuttiah Muralitharan, one of the modern era's most celebrated exponents of spin bowling was dogged by controversy over his bowling action for much of his international career. From his debut for Sri Lanka he was under scrutiny from umpires due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery. Despite initial criticism, the first occasion when his action became a real issue was when Australian umpire Darrell Hair called him for throwing during the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, 1995. Hair publicly stated that he would not hesitate to call Murali for throwing again, given the opportunity and considered his bowling action \"diabolical\". The inability of cricket's officials to agree on the legality of Muralitharan's action and the reluctance of other umpires to call him for throwing meant Hair was isolated and was later excluded from officiating in matches involving Sri Lanka. Subsequent bio-mechanical tests exonerated Muralitharan's action, showing that he did not extend his arm any more than many other bowlers with legal actions. This testing never completely cleared his action in the eyes of his critics, who claim the extension of the arm differs between bowling in testing and bowling in games, and also when he bowls particular deliveries. During testing at the University of Western Australia several independent witnesses, including former cricketer Bruce Yardley, were present to ensure Muralitharan bowled as he would in match conditions.\nSince the mid-1990s when Pakistani off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq pioneered the doosra, off spinners who have bowled with a non-classical action that can produce this delivery have routinely been reported and investigated for throwing. Such bowlers include Harbhajan Singh, Shoaib Malik, Marlon Samuels, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Johan Botha, Shane Shillingford and Moeen Ali. Moeen Ali, at least, although never actually banned from bowling, has stopped attempting to bowl the doosra and now bowls classical off-spin. Saqlain is one of the few bowlers of the doosra whose action has never been called into question, although he was regularly no-balled for the more conventional sin of overstepping the crease.\nBiomechanics and modifications to the throwing laws.\nTesting conducted in the 1990s in England revealed that during a delivery virtually all bowlers flex and extend their arms naturally to some degree as it rotates around the shoulder. This testing revealed that the strict Laws of Cricket which banned any flexing of the arm were impossible to follow.\nA set of tiered tolerance thresholds for the amount of allowable elbow extension, or straightening, were implemented: 10 degrees for fast bowlers, 7.5 degrees for medium pacers, and 5 degrees for spin bowlers. Enforcing these new measures proved problematic, as the laboratory based measurement systems used had a margin of error of at least 1 degree, and video based measurement systems were likely to have more, especially if inappropriately executed.\nA later study from 2000 to 2003 showed that bowling actions that looked normal to the naked eye in many of the world's elite fast bowlers had, on average, 9 degrees of elbow extension during the bowling action. Some recorded elbow extension measuring between 10 and 15 degrees, yet none of these bowlers had ever had a problem regarding the legality of their bowling action. This testing showed that a zero tolerance threshold, and the tiered thresholds implemented in the late 1990s, had no or little scientific merit. The study, conducted by the Australian Institute of Sport Biomechanics department, led by cricket biomechanist Dr. Marc Portus, involved taking three-dimensional video based biomechanical analyses during tour, test and one-day international matches in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Results from this work indicated that video based measurement error in such a scenario, using best practice methodologies, was 3 degrees. This report was submitted to the ICC in 2003, which instigated the review of the illegal action definition and processes.\nSubsequent to this the ICC received data from laboratory based analyses, on the basis that these measurement environments are more controlled, involving more sophisticated measurement technologies such as the Vicon Motion Analysis system. These were subject to less measurement error. Data was provided by the Australian Institute of Sport, the University of Western Australia and the Motion Analysis Corporation system from the University of Auckland. The ICC also carried out further video based three-dimensional analyses on all bowlers during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England. Regardless of the biomechanical measurement protocol used, a strikingly similar pattern emerged: the normal biomechanics of cricket bowling, whether it be spin or pace, features an element of elbow extension. The average extension of a normal, seemingly legal delivery was 8–10 degrees for all bowler types. There were virtually zero instances of no elbow extension at all in accordance with the original laws.\nThe ICC formed an expert panel comprising biomechanists Professor Bruce Elliott of The University of Western Australia, Dr Marc Portus of the Australian Institute of Sport and Dr Paul Hurrion from the UK who presented during a forum of a special ICC cricket sub-committee for illegal bowling actions in late 2003 in Dubai. The sub-committee was David Richardson, Angus Fraser, Aravinda De Silva, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis and Tim May. After this meeting the ICC decided to raise the elbow extension tolerance threshold to 15 degrees for all bowlers.\nThe new 15-degree limit was chosen after considering biomechanical findings from 130 pace and spin bowlers, the scientific issues with measurement, and that bowling actions considered to be \"throw-like\", or illegal, were usually measured to be well above 15 degrees of elbow extension, often in the 20 to 30-degree range.\nProcess once a bowler is reported.\nIf an umpire or match official deems that a bowler is contravening law 24.3, they detail this in the match report which is passed on the match referee. Within 24 hours of the conclusion of the match, the match referee provides the team manager and the ICC with a copy of the match report. A media statement is also issued that the player has been reported.\nThe first step in this process is an independent review of the player's bowling action which is carried out by a member of the ICC panel of human movement specialists, who will furnish the ICC with their report. If this report concludes that the player does have an illegal action, they are immediately suspended from all international cricket until they have remedied their action. If however, only a particular delivery is illegal, they can continue to bowl in international cricket provided they do not use the delivery in question until it has been remedied. Throughout the period of this independent assessment, the player can continue to bowl in international cricket.\nIf the player does not agree with the report, they can seek a hearing from a bowling review group made up of experts appointed by the ICC. This group will review evidence and decide, by a simple majority vote, on the legality of the player's action. If the player is cleared the suspension will be lifted immediately. A player who has been suspended from international cricket can continue to play domestic cricket under the supervision of his cricket Board. A player who has been suspended can at any time apply for a reassessment of their action. This usually happens after the player has completed a period of remedial work on their action. This reassessment is carried out in the same manner as the independent review. If the review concludes that the player has remedied their action the suspension will be lifted with immediate effect and they can start bowling in international cricket.\nIf the player is reported and suspended a second time within two years of his last report, he is automatically suspended for a period of one year before they can apply for a reassessment of their action. This event usually ends up effectively terminating a player's international career.\nIntentional throwing.\nIn general, although players with suspect actions now tend to be reported for investigations rather than suffering a public trial in front of spectators by being no-balled, umpires still have the right to call bowlers on the field if necessary. Such a case might occur when a bowler decides to deliberately and obviously throw the odd ball in a manner akin to a javelin throw as a surprise. Such cases have occurred throughout history of a bowler whose general action is not of concern but for whatever reason has appeared to deliberately throw a ball with a vastly different action. The Australian Test bowler Laurie Nash was once no-balled in such circumstances in the 1930s, with the journalists present opining that he had deliberately thrown the ball. The same was also true of David Gower (normally a batsman, and only a very occasional bowler) in the 1986 Eng/NZ Test at Trent Bridge: with New Zealand needing just one run to win with eight wickets in hand, rather than leaving the job of conceding the final run to a specialist bowler, Gower was brought on to bowl, and threw it with a fairly blatant illegal action (he normally bowled legally on the rare occasions that he bowled), conceding a no-ball for throwing. The batsman smacked the ball to the boundary anyway, and the four runs were awarded (in those days, if runs were scored from the bat off a no-ball, these were considered to replace the normal penalty run for a no-ball: the law has subsequently changed so that the penalty run is additional to any runs scored), leaving Gower with an unusual bowling analysis of conceding 4 runs from, technically, zero deliveries.\nHyperextension.\nIn a report by scientists commissioned by the ICC it was shown that Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Indian bowler R. P. Singh were seen to extend their elbow joints by a negative angle with respect to the upper arm. This phenomenon, also known as hyperextension, can give the illusion of throwing. In the report it was seen that R. P. Singh maintained this negative angle throughout his delivery stride, while Akhtar sometimes bowled a quicker delivery by flexing this hyperextension. These actions are not considered to be chucking as they are due to the distinctive architecture of their elbows, possibly a congenital condition. Since these cricketers have no control over this hyperextension, any degree of hyperextension (past zero) is not included in the 15-degree extension tolerance threshold."

        "text": "The Senior Professional Baseball Association, referred to commonly as the \"Senior League\", was a winter baseball league based in Florida for players age 35 and over, with a minimum age of 32 for catchers. The league began play in 1989 and had eight teams in two divisions and a 72-game schedule. Pitchers Rollie Fingers, Ferguson Jenkins (both future Hall of Famers), and Vida Blue, outfielder Dave Kingman, and managers Earl Weaver and Dick Williams were the league's marquee names; and former big league outfielder Curt Flood was the circuit's first Commissioner. At age 54, Ed Rakow was the league's oldest player.\nFirst season.\nThroughout the inaugural season, most clubs struggled with poor attendance, with an average attendance of less than 1,000 per game. On the field, the West Palm Beach Tropics ran away with the league's South Division, finishing 15 games ahead of the second place Fort Myers Sun Sox. In the North, the St. Petersburg Pelicans finished in first, and the Bradenton Explorers were second, narrowly holding off the Orlando Juice.\nInfielder Ron Washington of West Palm Beach was the league's offensive star, hitting .359 with a league leading 73 RBIs and winning the MVP award. Washington's teammate Mickey Rivers hit .366, and Gold Coast Sun Bert Campaneris, the oldest everyday player in the league at 47, stole 16 bases. Bradenton's Jim Morrison hit .290 with 55 RBIs and led the league with 17 homers. Tim Ireland of Fort Myers hit a league best .374, and his teammate Kim Allen paced the circuit with 33 stolen bases. Willie Aikens hit 12 home runs and had 58 RBIs. West Palm Beach pitcher Juan Eichelberger went 11–5 with a 2.90 ERA, and St. Petersburg's Milt Wilcox went 12–3. Jon Matlack, Tim Stoddard, and Pete Falcone each won 10 games. Bradenton's Rick Lysander saved 11 games, and Winter Haven's Bill Campbell notched 5 saves to go along with a 2.12 ERA. Joaquín Andújar of Gold Coast had 5 wins and an ERA of 1.31.\nIn the first weekend of February 1990, the league's top four teams participated in a three-game, single elimination tournament with a rather unusual format. On February 2, the league's second place clubs faced off. The Explorers defeated the Sun Sox for a chance to face the St. Petersburg Pelicans. The next day, the Pelicans beat the Explorers 9–2 to advance to the league championship game against the West Palm Beach Tropics. On February 4, 1990, the Pelicans, powered by Lamar Johnson's home run and 3 RBIs, beat the Tropics 12–4 for the league's first championship.\nThe 1989-90 player statistics for all teams were published in the Sporting News on February 12, 1990, pages 30–31 \"Assessing the Boys of Winter\".\n1989/1990 Teams\nNorthern Division\nSouthern Division\nSecond season.\nFor its second season, four of the league's eight teams (Gold Coast, Orlando, St. Lucie, and Winter Haven) folded; the West Palm Beach Tropics became a traveling team known as the Florida Tropics, and the Explorers moved from Bradenton to Daytona Beach, becoming the Daytona Beach Explorers. The circuit then added clubs in Arizona, the Sun City Rays, as well as in California, the San Bernardino Pride. In addition, the league dropped the minimum age to 34 and shortened the season to 56 games. Less than halfway through its second season, the SPBA folded on December 26, 1990.\n1990/1991 Standings\nRon Washington, Joaquín Andújar, Paul Mirabella, Danny Boone, and Ozzie Virgil Jr. signed Major League Baseball contracts after playing in the Senior League; Mirabella, Boone, and Virgil all played in the Majors after their appearances in the SPBA."

Bright spots included pitcher Joaquín Andújar, who posted a 5–0 record with a 1.31 earned run average, and shortstop Bert Campaneris as the oldest everyday player in the league at 47, who hit a .291 batting average and stole 16 bases in 60 games.\nBut the Suns struggled for most of the season, ending with a 32–39 record and out of the playoffs.

However, after breaking camp with the Mariners, Allen was used almost exclusively as a pinch-runner, and then was sent down at the end of April.\nAfter his big league career, Allen played in Japan for the Hanshin Tigers during the and seasons. In 1982, he hit .260/.326/.358 and stole 22 bases in 28 tries and posted .276/.340/.409 in 47 games in 1983. Surprisingly, he was caught in eight of 20 steal attempts that year.\nAllen also spent 1976 in the Mexican League while playing for the Alacranes de Durango.\nIn between, he played winter ball with the Navegantes del Magallanes club of the Venezuelan League in the 1980-81 season, and for the Petroleros de Zulia of the extinct Inter-American League in 1979.\nAllen then suited up for the Senior Professional Baseball Association's Fort Myers Sun Sox in and led the league with 33 stolen bases."

        "title": "Fox Saturday Baseball",
        "text": "Fox Saturday Baseball is an American television presentation of Major League Baseball (MLB) games produced by Fox Sports for the Fox network on Saturday afternoons.\nFox's coverage includes 4 weeks worth of coverage as of 2023. Coverage usually includes 2 to 4 separate games all starting at 4PM ET, local affiliates air the game of most interest to their audience.\nHistory.\nFox has used numerous scheduling formulas for its Saturday regular season coverage. These have often changed based on the rights granted by new television contracts, and the pregame programs that the network has chosen to air. From 1996 to 2006, Fox began its weekly game telecasts on the Saturday before, of, or after Memorial Day weekend. The selection of games varied on a regional basis, and the start times were staggered based on region. A half-hour pregame show aired at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, followed by game broadcasts held at 1 p.m. in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. West Coast games did not air until 4 p.m. Eastern Time (1 p.m. in the Pacific Time Zone). All of these games were exclusive to the broadcast network, and as a result, Fox's exclusivity window lasted through the entire afternoon.\nIn 2007, Fox began airing games every Saturday during the season. A new scheduling format was devised, in which all of the regional games started simultaneously. Fox moved the pregame, which became part of the exclusive game window, to 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. All of the Fox games would then start at 3:55 p.m. Eastern Time, regardless of region. This format gave more leeway for teams not being shown on Fox to schedule daytime games. Fox's exclusivity began at the start of the pregame at 3:30 and ran until 7 p.m. Eastern.\nFox discontinued its pregame show in 2009, with the telecasts now beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern and the game time being pushed to 4:10. Fox gave up the first half-hour of its exclusivity, with its window now beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. This scheduling formula was used through 2011 for the regular season. Beginning in 2010, several of the Saturday games aired in prime time during the spring. These telecasts used an exclusivity window from 7 to 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time, as the network revived a pregame show for these games, airing at 7 p.m. with the game at 7:15.\nIn 2012, the pregame show returned full-time, prompting another change in scheduling. The normal scheduling in 2012 and 2013 was for the pregame airing at either 12:30 or 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The pregame is not a part of Fox's exclusive window, which began with the game telecast starting a half-hour later. The scheduling did not change for the spring prime time games, however, as the scheduling for these games remained the same as in 2010 and 2011. However these games began being branded as \"Baseball Night in America\" games instead of \"Fox Saturday Baseball\".\nIn 2021 and 2022, Fox did not air \"Fox Saturday Baseball\" afternoon games, instead moving its entire MLB schedule to primetime \"Baseball Night in America\" windows. For 2023, with an increase in Fox windows, Fox returned to airing four weeks of \"Fox Saturday Baseball\"."

The league features twenty-five teams in Ontario, one in Quebec, and one in the Akwesasne (which straddles the two aforementioned provinces and New York) that annually play a 20-game schedule and four rounds of playoffs for the J. A. MacDonald Trophy. After the conclusion of the playoffs, a league champion represents the OJBLL at the Founders Cup National Junior B Championship.\nHistory.\nThe Ontario Junior B Lacrosse League of the Ontario Lacrosse Association has been around since at least 1965. The OJBLL compete for the J. A. MacDonald Trophy annually at the provincial level. At the national level, the OJBLL has been extremely dominant at the Founders Cup tournament only losing out to other leagues a handful of times in the last 40+ years.\nPlayers from the OJBLL and the Ontario Junior A Lacrosse League are often drafted straight into the professional levels of lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League and Canadian Lacrosse League.\nThe league has changed formats few times in the last few decades. The league has played with no divisions (1990) and with as many as seven (2005). In the past few years, the league has expanded to Oakville, Windsor, London, Cornwall, Hamilton, Niagara, Markham, Orangeville, and Welland. Also, for the 2007 season, the City of Caledon applied to resurrect its old Caledon Bandits franchise, but was offered a spot in the new OLA Junior C Lacrosse League in 2008. Kahnawake Hunters joined the OLA Junior B League in 2009 after not fielding a team in the OLA or Iroquois League for five years. In 2012, the Brampton Excelsiors joined the OJBLL.\nClarington Green Gaels had a run between 1998 and 2004 when the Gaels won four Founders Cups Canadian Junior B titles and two J. A. MacDonald Trophy championships. Of the more recent expansion of the league, the Oakville Buzz have been the most remarkable franchise to be built. In 2006, the Buzz team went 19-1 and strolled through the playoffs with little opposition. The Buzz went undefeated at the Founders Cup and crushed the hopes of the host Windsor AKO Fratmen, beating them by a score of 10–4 in the final. Oakville made the jump to Junior A for the 2019 season.\nSix Nations Rebels dominated the league from 2007 through 2014, winning five league championships (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013) and six Founders Cups (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014).\nOrangeville continued the league success at Founders Cup winning back-to-back titles in 2016 and 2017. Elora Mohawks kept the OJBLL streak alive when they captured gold at the 2018 national championship. It would mark the sixth gold medal in the history of the Mohawks.\nChampions.\nOverall champions are bolded. In three-division years, the \"italics\" denote finals runner-up.

In 2010, the Woodsmen would win their fourth-consecutive and seventh overall league title, both league records.\nAt the beginning of the 2010 season the Nitro changed their name to Norwood Champs, then Ennismore James Gang in 2013. Huntsville Hawks were added as a new franchise for the 2010 season.\nSt. Catharines Saints joined the league for the 2011 season and won the 2013 Presidents Cup in just their third season.\nSarnia Beavers joined in 2012 and the Six Nations Rivermen in 2013.

In the early 20th century the CLA had another rival league, the Dominion Lacrosse Association in much of the same markets as the NLU. In these early days, all lacrosse was field lacrosse. Early powerhouses in the league were the Orangeville Dufferins (1890s) and the St. Catharines Athletics (1900s and 1910s).\nIn 1913, the CLA became the Ontario Amateur Lacrosse Association. The league had a Western Division with teams in Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe and an Eastern Division with teams in the Ottawa District, but a year later the Ottawa teams left the league. In 1920, the NLU had dropped to 3 teams and elected to disband. The OALA was left as the only Senior A league in Ontario and only had to face the Ontario Intermediate A champion for a berth into the Mann Cup National Senior championships.\nIn 1926, an OALA team won its first Mann Cup. Until this point, the Mann Cup was a challenge trophy, mostly dominated by British Columbia's New Westminster Salmonbellies, in 1926 the entire country could compete for the trophy in a playdown style. As standings leaders of the OALA at midpoint, the Weston Westonmen were awarded the right to represent the OALA for the Mann Cup. The Westonmen were met by the Winnipeg Tigers, whom they defeated 11-3 to become the first Mann Cup champion of the playdown era. The Westonmen were then forced to face the Brampton Excelsiors in the Ontario final who beat them 10-goals-to-6 in a two-game series. The Westonmen would dominate the Ontario scene in the 1920s with 5 league titles and the 1926 Mann Cup. In 1931, the Excelsiors defeated the Toronto Native Sons 2-games-to-1 to win the OALA championship. The Excelsiors would go on to defeat New Westminster in the Mann Cup final 2-games-to-1. This marked the end of Field Lacrosse for this league and the last Mann Cup to ever be conducted on a field.\nIndoor Era.\nThe Mimico Mountaineers would defeat the Fergus Thistles 2-games-to-1 to become the first Ontario Senior A box lacrosse champions. They would later host the Winnipeg Argos at Maple Leaf Gardens and win the first ever indoor Mann Cup 2-games-to-none.\nThe Orillia Terriers would be the most dominant OALA team in the 1930s, winning four straight OALA title (1934–1937) and three consecutive Mann Cup (1934–1936) becoming the first team of the Indoor Era to accomplish that streak.\nIn 1939, the league became the Ontario Lacrosse Association Senior A League (OLA).\nThe St. Catharines Athletics found their stride in 1938 and would win the OLA seven times in nine seasons (losing 1942 and 1943 to Brampton). The Athletics would be National Champions five times in that span, beating the New Westminster Adanacs 3-games-to-none in 1938, the Vancouver Burrards 3-games-to-1 in 1940, the Richmond Farmers 3-games-to-2 in 1941, the New Westminster Salmonbellies 3-games-to-2 in 1944 and the 'Bellies again in 1946 3-games-to-none.\nIn 1951, the core of the 1950 Mann Cup winning Owen Sound Crescents, including star goalie Lloyd \"Moon\" Wootton transferred to the Peterborough Trailermen. The move would lead to one of the biggest dynasties ever in lacrosse, including 8 OLA championships in 9 years, 4 Mann Cups, and an infamous standoff with the Canadian Lacrosse Association that left the entire team suspended for five years. From 1951 until 1957, the Trailermen won 7 straight OLA League titles and the first four years they won the Mann Cup, becoming the first indoor team to win four years straight. In 1951, the Trailermen defeated the Vancouver Combines 4-games-to-3 to win their first Mann Cup, then beat Vancouver (Burrards) again in 1952 4-games-to-none to win it again. In 1953 and 1954, the Trailermen defeated the Victoria Shamrocks 4-games-to-1 and 4-games-straight respectively to cap off the four cup run. Victoria would return the favour in 1955, beating the Trailermen in 5 games, and the Nanaimo Timbermen would do the same in 1956. The Trailermen would win their league again in 1957, but controversy ensued at the Mann Cup. Peterborough's star scorer Bob Allan left a BC team without receiving a release to come play for the Trailermen. Although the OLA ruled him eligible, when the team arrived in BC to play the Mann Cup, the CLA barred him from playing. Peterborough refused to take the floor for the first game without Allan and the CLA kicked them out of the playoffs and suspended every player on the team for five seasons. The Trailermen were replaced by a rusty Long Branch Pontiacs squad that were easily swept by Victoria. The Trailermen players sat out their suspension in 1958, but their suspensions were commuted in time for the 1959 season. Peterborough would win yet another league title in 1959, but could not muster any past success in the Mann Cup final. The dynasty had ended and Peterborough did not make another final for six seasons.\nAll-Star Game.\nDuring the 2012 MSL Entry Draft, the league announced it would be holding its first ever All-Star Game. Peterborough was set to host, citing average attendance as the driving factor. However, in April that same year, the game was cancelled due to two major issues. The first was concern of unnecessary risk of injury and the other was the distribution of revenue."

        "text": "The Australia men's national basketball team, nicknamed the Boomers after the slang term for a male kangaroo, represents Australia in international basketball competition.\nSince the late 1980s, Australia has placed among the world elite teams, as the Boomers have reached the semi-finals at both Summer Olympic Games and FIBA World Cup on many occasions. Originally a member of the FIBA Oceania region, Australia nowadays competes at the FIBA Asia Cup where the Boomers were the dominant team at their first appearance. The FIBA Oceania Championship mostly consisted of a three-match competition against the other regional power, the New Zealand Tall Blacks. Before the formation of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1979, Boomers players were selected from state leagues around the country, with Victoria, South Australia, and to a lesser extent New South Wales the dominant states. After the formation of the NBL, players began to be selected almost exclusively from that competition during the 1980s and 1990s.\nOccasionally players were selected from outside the NBL. Mark Bradtke made his Boomers debut in 1987 while attending the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) before he entered the NBL. Luc Longley made his debut in 1988 while playing college basketball in the United States. Other Australian players enter the Euroleague and the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the U.S. The Boomers's roster for the 2014 World Cup included five NBA players: Cameron Bairstow with the Chicago Bulls, Aron Baynes with the San Antonio Spurs, Matthew Dellavedova with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Dante Exum and Joe Ingles with the Utah Jazz. Three other players who were ruled out of the World Cup due to injury also played or would later play in the NBA, namely Andrew Bogut, Ben Simmons and Patty Mills.\nSeveral players on youth national teams are student athletes at the AIS or in the US college basketball system. Some players (e.g. Longley) made the senior national team while at US schools. By the early 21st century, almost half of the squad played outside Australia. For the 2012 London Olympic Games, only two members of the Australian squad were based in the country – Peter Crawford and Adam Gibson, with the latter being the only Australia-based member of the 2014 World Cup squad.\nAustralia has participated in the Olympic men's basketball tournaments 15 times. The Boomers won a bronze medal against Slovenia in the 2020 Olympic Games, making Australia the first team from outside the Americas and European regions to ever win a medal at the event. Australia has also participated in 12 FIBA World Cups without winning a medal, making Australia the nation with the third-most appearances at the tournament without winning a medal, behind Canada and Puerto Rico (both 14).\nHistory.\nPre-1970s.\nAustralia debuted on the international stage at the 1956 Summer Olympic Games held in Melbourne. Australia did not fare well in the competition, as they defeated only two sides (Singapore and Thailand), finishing 12th. The seeds were sown for Australia to become a regular team in international events.\nAfter not qualifying for the 1960 Summer Olympic Games in Rome, Italy, Australia returned to compete at the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games. The Australians improved on their position in Melbourne, to be ranked ninth at the completion of the games. After failing in their bid to qualify for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, the Australians were left in international isolation.\n1970–80s.\nThey did not play again in a major international tournament until 1970, when the team qualified for the FIBA World Championship for the first time. The team finished in 12th place, with their sole victory coming over the United Arab Republic.\nAt the 1972 Munich Olympic Games Australia changed its guards. Lindsay Gaze made his coaching debut, after he had played at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Australia again finished ninth, but close defeats to Czechoslovakia and Spain left the team just a few baskets away from advancing to the second round. Eddie Palubinskas was the holder of the second highest scoring average of the tournament.\nAt the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, Eddie Palubinskas finished as the top overall scorer, and set three Olympic scoring records, including the most points scored in a single Olympics to that time, with 269 points. The Boomers defeated Mexico, 120–117, in an overtime game, and defeated Japan, 117–79, as they moved to the second round of the tournament for the first time, on their way to an eighth-place finish.\nIn 1978, the Boomers headed to the Philippines for the 1978 FIBA World Championship. Australia played their most successful tournament to that time, defeating Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines (twice), and playing eventual gold medallist Yugoslavia, losing 105–101. The Boomers advanced to the semi-final round, and placed seventh.\nIn the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, the Boomers played their best Olympic tournament to that date, equalling their 1976 finish of eighth place. The Boomers defeated eventual silver medallist Italy, 84–77, in the preliminary round, but due to a three-way tie with Italy and Cuba, the team failed to advance to the final round, despite 5 wins and 2 losses.\nTwo years later, the 1982 FIBA World Championship was held in Colombia. The Australians finished in fifth place.\nThe Boomers were captained at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games by Phil Smyth, and introduced coach Lindsay Gaze’s 19-year-old son, Andrew Gaze, to the world stage. Australia advanced to the second round, following victories over Brazil and West Germany. A loss to Italy, and a 16-point win over Egypt, left the Boomers in a must-win situation against Spain, to advance to the medal round. Spain went up big early in the first half, but the Boomers fought back, ultimately losing by a score of 101–93, ending their medal hopes with an Olympic best seventh-place finish.\nFollowing the 1984 Olympics, Adrian Hurley took over as team coach from Lindsay Gaze.\nThe 1986 FIBA World Championship was a bit disappointing for Australia. Losses to Uruguay, Angola, and the Soviet Union during group play kept the Boomers from advancing, and the team finished 17th. Due to a FIBA rule allowing one naturalised player per squad at the World Championship, American born point guard Cal Bruton made his Boomers debut at the age of 32.\nIn 1987, the Boomers faced a home series against the Soviet Union (known as the Wang Superchallenge) and although they lost all 6 games, the team, with all players drawn from the NBL other than Australian Institute of Sport attendee, 6'10\" (208 cm) centre / power forward Mark Bradtke who was making his debut for the Boomers as a 17 year old (Bradtke would make his NBL debut in 1988 with the Adelaide 36ers).\nMotivated by the 1986 FIBA World Championship, Australia showed up to the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games with quite possibly its most talented roster to that date. Captained by Phil Smyth, the team included Andrew Gaze, Damian Keogh, Darryl Pearce, Ray Borner, and future Chicago Bulls triple NBA Championship winning centre, 7'2\" (218 cm) Luc Longley who was attending the University of New Mexico. The Boomers breezed through the first round, losing only to gold medallist Soviet Union and silver medallist Yugoslavia. Finishing third place in their group, Australia advanced to the quarter-finals, where they defeated Spain in a closely fought game, by a score of 77–74, sending the Boomers to their first ever semi-finals. They were beaten by Yugoslavia in the semi-final, and then lost to the United States (including future Hall of Fame player David Robinson), who ended Australia’s dream run with a 78–49 victory in the bronze-medal playoff. Despite the disappointing loss, the Boomers’ fourth-place finish was their best ever result at an Olympic Games (or World Championship) and solidified their status as a rising team.\n1990s: Gaze, Heal and Longley.\nAustralia flew off to Buenos Aires for the 1990 FIBA World Championship. Led by Andrew Gaze’s 24.3 points per game, fourth most in the tournament, the team defeated China, Brazil and Argentina (twice) on their way to a respectable seventh-place finish.\nAt the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, the Boomers looked to prove their fourth-place run at Seoul was no fluke. In the first Summer Olympic Games since the Soviet Union’s dissolution, and the first that FIBA allowed professional basketball players to play in, Australia played to a respectable 4–4 record and sixth place. The 1992 Olympics saw the return of NBA center Luc Longley for the Boomers.\nPrior to the 1992 Olympics, the Boomers played in a 3-game home series against a visiting \"All-Star\" team headlined by NBA and NCAA college basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Boomers won the series 2–1, including attracting a then Australian basketball record 15,000 fans to the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne. The Boomers also played in the 1992 NBL All-Star Game at the AIS Arena in Canberra against the \"USA Stars\" (made up of import players in the NBL) which was played on 4 July and was promoted as the \"Independence Day Challenge\". The Boomers won the game 149–132 with Andrew Gaze scoring 43 points.\nAt the 1994 FIBA World Championship at Toronto, Andrew Gaze starred for the Boomers, leading the tournament with an average of 23.9 points per game. In victories over Puerto Rico, South Korea, and Cuba, Gaze scored 34, 31, and 30 points, respectively. Australia finished with a 5–3 record, and finished the tournament in fifth place. This was Phil Smyth’s last World Championship appearance as a player\nSmyth, the teams long-time captain and point guard would play one last time for the Boomers in March 1995 in Game 4 of a 5-game series against the touring Magic Johnson All-Stars in front of a packed house (12,000) at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. The Boomers lost in both Adelaide and Brisbane and were ultimately swept 5–0 by the All-Stars (who included former NBA stars Magic Johnson and Mark Aguirre), they pushed the visitors all the way in Game 3 at the National Tennis Centre, while Games 4 (Sydney) and 5 (Perth Entertainment Centre) went into overtime. The series however saw the Boomers without 4 of their usual starting 5 with only Andrew Vlahov who captained the side playing all 5 games. Missing for the Boomers were Andrew Gaze (playing in Greece), Shane Heal, Mark Bradtke and Luc Longley who was playing for the Chicago Bulls.\nThe 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games were another solid showing for Australia. Led by Andrew Gaze, and featuring Shane Heal, the team rolled through the early competition, losing only to eventual silver medallist Yugoslavia, and scoring over 100 points in every other preliminary game. In the quarterfinals, the Boomers played a hard fought game against Croatia. The game came down to the wire, as forward Tony Ronaldson hit a 3-pointer to win the game, and advance Australia to the semi-finals. There they met the United States, who were powered by a roster of professional NBA players, and the Boomers were defeated 101–73. Lithuania would defeat Australia in the bronze medal game, and the Boomers equalled their 1988 fourth-place finish.\nJust prior to the 1996 Olympics, the Boomers played the USA in a warm up game. The game, played at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, was won 118–77 by the USA, though Heal topped all scorers with 28 points including hitting 8 of 12 three pointers. Heal had a running battle with NBA superstar Charles Barkley during the game with the two almost coming to blows at one point, though they hugged in mutual respect on-court after the game.\nFollowing their exciting run at Atlanta, the Boomers showed up in Greece, for the 1998 FIBA World Championship with high hopes. Shane Heal and Andrew Gaze both finished among the top five scorers, with averages of 17.0 and 16.9 points per game, respectively; but a loss to the United States knocked Australia out of medal contention. The Boomers finished the tournament respectably with wins over Canada and Brazil, and walked away with ninth place.\n2000s: Sydney Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Bogut.\nThe 2000 Summer Olympic Games projected to be an extremely exciting affair for the Boomers, as they played as host in Sydney. Despite losses in both of their first two games, Australia recovered nicely, and won their next four games over Russia, Angola, and Spain, to propel them into the quarter-finals, where they defeated Italy. But Australia’s first basketball medal was not to be, as France won the semi-final match, and Lithuania captured the bronze medal game. Although their goal of medalling was not achieved, the Boomers gave the home crowd plenty to cheer about, on their way to a fourth-place finish.\nAfter failing to qualify for the 2002 FIBA World Championship, the Boomers came into the 2004 Athens Olympic Games hungry for victory. Captained by Shane Heal, and featuring future NBA Draft first pick Andrew Bogut in his international debut, Australia fought hard on their way to a ninth-place finish.\nIn early 2006, Australia entered the first ever Commonwealth Games basketball competition in their home city of Melbourne and went through the tournament undefeated to claim the gold medal. Later in 2006 at the FIBA World Championship in Japan, Australia was led in scoring by Andrew Bogut, C.J. Bruton, and Jason Smith. Despite their efforts, the Boomers failed to qualify for the playoff rounds, and finished tied for ninth place.\nThe Boomers entered the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games with one of their more talented rosters to date, which included Andrew Bogut, C.J. Bruton, Captain Matthew Nielsen, and Patty Mills, in his international debut. Despite his youth, Mills had a hot hand, scoring over 20 points on several occasions, and leading the team with an average of 14.2 points per game. Australia made the quarter-finals, but gold medallists United States put the Boomers away late in the game, ending their run with a seventh-place finish.\n2010s: Additional NBA players.\nThe Boomers qualified for the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey and placed 10th overall. In 2011, Melbourne-born number one NBA draft pick Kyrie Irving considered declaring his international allegiance to Australia in order to compete in the 2012 Olympics, but eventually opted to wait for international selection for the United States.\nDespite Irving declining the offer to represent his country of birth, the Boomers entered the 2012 London Olympic Games with arguably their most talented roster since 2000, though they were missing their star centre Andrew Bogut, who was out with a broken ankle. Australia made the quarter-finals with a 3–2 win–loss record, but gold medallists United States put the Boomers away late in the game, ending their run with a seventh-place finish again.\nFollowing the London Olympics, Brett Brown announced his decision to step down as Boomers head coach, citing his desire to spend more time with his family in the United States. As of December 2012, Basketball Australia was yet to announce his replacement, although one of his assistants, dual National Basketball League championship winning coach with the New Zealand Breakers, Andrej Lemanis, was one of the favourites to win the job.\nOn 24 April 2013, Lemanis was announced as the new head coach of the Boomers.\nBy winning the 2013 FIBA Oceania Championship, Australia qualified for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. Australia was drawn into Group D, alongside Lithuania, Slovenia, Angola, Mexico, and South Korea. After suffering an opening round 90–80 loss to Slovenia, Australia bounced back, stringing together three consecutive wins over South Korea, Lithuania and Mexico, the first time in 16 years that Australia had won 3 consecutive matches at the FIBA World Cup. However, in their next match Australia suffered a 91–83 loss to Angola, which came despite leading by 15 points in the middle of the third quarter. This result, combined with Lithuania's 67–64 win over Slovenia, meant that Australia finished third in their group, qualifying for the knockout stage of the tournament.\nBecause Australia would finish third by losing, and that finishing third would benefit Australia more than finishing second, combined with the absences of fit key players Aron Baynes and Joe Ingles led to allegations that Australia deliberately lost their game against Angola in order to finish third in their group, and as a result, avoid the United States until the semi-finals, with Slovenian basketballer Goran Dragić posting \"Basketball is a beautiful sport, there is no room for fixing the game like today Australia vs Angola!! @FIBA should do something about that!\" on Twitter. However, these claims were denied by Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis. On 26 November 2014, Australia was cleared of tanking by FIBA.\nAustralia met World No. 7 Turkey in the knockout stage of the tournament. Australia suffered a 65–64 loss to Turkey, ending their World Cup campaign, meaning that for the 11th World Cup, Australia would return home empty handed.\nLeading into the 2016 Rio Olympics, Australia saw a surge in locals being drafted into the NBA. Along with former number 1 NBA draft pick Andrew Bogut, Dante Exum was taken with the fifth pick in the 2014 NBA draft and Ben Simmons was selected with the first pick in the 2016 NBA draft, adding to already established Australian NBA players in Patty Mills, Matthew Dellavedova, Joe Ingles and Aron Baynes. Forward Thon Maker was also drafted with the 10th pick in the 2016 NBA draft. Despite Exum, Maker and Simmons electing not to compete in the 2016 Olympics, the Australians equaled their best ever performance by reaching the semifinals and losing their bronze medal playoff with Spain by one point.\n2017: Move into Asian basketball.\nIn August 2015, FIBA announced Australia would be joining the Asian basketball zone for future tournaments, starting with the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup. The Boomers were victorious in their inaugural Asia Cup appearance and turned their attention to 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers against Asian opposition. In July 2018, during the 3rd quarter of their game against the Philippines for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia), Filipino player Roger Pogoy hit Chris Goulding with a hard foul causing teammate Daniel Kickert to retaliate with an elbow strike which sparked a full-scale brawl between the Australians and the Filipinos. Suspensions and fines were handed off to those involved including players from both teams, Filipino coaches and the referees for failing to control the game. After qualifying for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Australia reached the semi-finals for the first time and finished the tournament in fourth place.\n2020s: Olympic breakthrough and more NBA players.\nAt the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, led by veterans Patty Mills and Joe Ingles, the Boomers managed to claim their first ever international medal, defeating a Luka Dončić led Slovenia, 107–93. Mills would score 42 points in the decisive match. The Boomers went through the group stage undefeated, and Mills would be named to the tournament All-Star 5. Additional Australian player were drafted into the NBA with first round draft picks including 2019 pick 20 Matisse Thybulle, 2020 pick 18 Josh Green, 2021 pick 6 Josh Giddey and 2022 pick 8 Dyson Daniels.\nRecords.\nAndrew Gaze holds the record for most appearances with the Boomers at 297 international games. Gaze also holds the record for the most points scored by a Boomer.\nThe Australian National Basketball Team defeated the United States Team 98–94 in Melbourne, 24 August 2019, for the first time.\nCompetitive record.\n\"A red box around the year indicates tournaments played within Australia\"\nFIBA World Cup.\nNB: This competition was known as the FIBA World Championship through the 2010 edition."

        "title": "1992–93 UEFA Champions League",
        "text": "The 1992–93 UEFA Champions League was the 38th European Cup, the premier European club football tournament, and the first season with the UEFA Champions League branding (originally adopted only in the group stage).\nIt was the second season of the competition in which the eight second round winners would be split into two groups, with the winner of each one meeting in the final. In addition, a preliminary round was required as this was the first season after the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, resulting in many new countries eligible to enter the champions of their own leagues into the competition. Israel and the Faroe Islands were also represented for the first time.\nThe tournament was won for the first time by Marseille, defeating AC Milan in the final, becoming the first and as of 2023 only French team to win the European Cup/Champions League.\nHowever, soon after Marseille's victory allegations of match fixing were levelled at them and their president Bernard Tapie. This involved a league game that took place 6 days before the final where Marseille, it emerged, had fixed their title-clinching Division 1 game against Valenciennes so they could concentrate on the final against Milan. It is believed that Tapie bribed Valenciennes to lose so that Marseille would win the French league earlier, and above all that they would not injure the Marseille players before the final against Milan. Before the 1991 European Cup final against Red Star Belgrade, Marseille had a few injured players, Tapie did not want to repeat this mistake. This resulted in Marseille being stripped of their league title by the French Football Federation (although not the European Cup, as the match in question was not in that competition). They were banned from defending their European title in the 1993–94 season, and contesting the Intercontinental Cup and Super Cup. During the 1995 trial over Marseille's financial accounts, it was revealed that they had an annual budget of Fr5 million (about €760,000) dedicated to the purchase of matches from 1989 to 1993. The UEFA, along with the French Federation (FFF) and France authorities, investigated several Marseille matches during the 1992–93 season. These investigations have not established any formal proof concerning alleged match-fixing in the Champions League. Therefore, Marseille's status as 1993 European champion was not affected. Barcelona, the defending champions, were eliminated in the second round by CSKA Moscow.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage began on 25 November 1992 and ended on 21 April 1993. The eight teams were divided into two groups of four, and the teams in each group played against each other on a home-and-away basis, meaning that each team played a total of six group matches. For each win, teams were awarded two points, with one point awarded for each draw. At the end of the group stage, the first team in each group advanced to the final.\nTop goalscorers.\nThe top scorers from the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League (excluding preliminary round) are as follows:"

        "title": "Rugby union in Australia",
        "text": "Rugby union in Australia has a history of organised competition dating back to the late 1860s. Although traditionally most popular in Australia's rugby football strongholds of New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT, it is played throughout the nation.\nThe principal competition in Australian rugby is Super Rugby, which is a multi-national competition across the South Pacific. Australia enters five teams: the Reds of Queensland, the Waratahs of New South Wales, the Brumbies of the Australian Capital Territory, the Western Force of Western Australia and the Melbourne Rebels of Victoria.\nCurrently there is no nationwide domestic competition for rugby union in Australia following the disbandment of the National Rugby Championship in 2020. Competitions below the level of Super Rugby are traditional capital city competitions, such as the Shute Shield of Sydney, Queensland Premier Rugby of Brisbane, the ACTRU Premier Division in Canberra, and Perth's Fortescue Premier Grade. These city-based competitions have traditionally formed the highest level of domestic competition for the sport in Australia.\nThe national governing body of Rugby Australia launched a new top-level women's 15s competition known as Super W in 2018 featuring five clubs branded as state/territorial teams—the ACT, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. \nThe men's national team are the Wallabies, who have won the Rugby World Cup twice, in 1991 and in 1999. The women's national team are the Wallaroos achieving a best result of third place in 2010 during the Women's Rugby World Cup. \nRugby union holds the match attendance record of any football code in New South Wales (109,874), Western Australia (61,241) and the Australian Capital Territory (28,753).\nAustralia has also achieved success in numerous Rugby Sevens tournaments with the women's sevens team winning the Rugby World Cup Sevens once in 2009, winning gold at the 2016 Olympics, and winning the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series three times. While the men's sevens team has been runners-up twice in the Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nAccounts of rugby being played in the Colony of New South Wales date back to the 1840s. Some settlers would have been familiar with earlier forms of the game even before it was formally codified at Rugby School in 1845. \nRugby arrived in the Colony of Victoria as early as the 1850s. Tom Wills founder of Australian rules was of the rugby school and attempted to introduce the code into Melbourne schools in 1858 before settling on a compromise of rules. Variations of rugby were played by clubs south of the Yarra, including possibly South Yarra as early as 1858. In 1860 J. B. Thompson published the Rugby Rules (along with the Victorian and Eton Rules) in the widely distributed The Victorian Cricketer's Guide.\nThe Rugby code was introduced to schools in Sydney from the early 1860s. Players familiar with the game from the Sydney schools, along with increased arrivals from England and elsewhere, soon led to organised club football commencing in Sydney. Rugby games were being played at Sydney University in the 1860s. \nThe first rugby union club to be established in Australia was Sydney University's in 1864. In 1869, Newington College was the first Australian school to play rugby in a match against the University of Sydney. A decade after the first club was formed, a body called the Southern Rugby Union was formed as a result of a meeting at the Oxford Hotel in Sydney, a Sydney competition was established, which was administered from the England Rugby headquarters at Twickenham. The first competition commenced in Sydney the following year in 1875 with 6 teams.\nProminent southern Melbourne football clubs including Albert Park and South Melbourne strongly advocated for rugby rules throughout the 1860s and 1870s, however this did not meet favour with the more powerful clubs in the colony.\nThe earliest record of rugby games being played in the Colony of Queensland was in 1876.\nThe 'Waratah' Rugby Club invited Australian rules football club, the Carlton Football Club to play two matches, one under rugby rules and one under Australian rules. On Saturday 23 June, 3,000 spectators watched Waratah beat Carlton at rugby at the Albert Cricket Ground in Redfern. In the return leg, Carlton defeated Waratah under Australian rules. \nThe first inter-colonial game occurred on 12 August 1882, when players from the four Queensland clubs (who played both rugby and Australian rules football) travelled to NSW. NSW won by 28 points to 4 at the Association Ground (later to be renamed the Sydney Cricket Ground) in front of 4,000 spectators. Later that same year, the Southern Rugby Union undertook its inaugural tour of New Zealand, winning four of its seven matches.\nOn 2 November, in 1883, the Northern Rugby Union was formed as the rugby body in Queensland after a meeting at the Exchange Hotel. As a result of the formation of the new body, several prominent grammar schools took up rugby as opposed to Melbourne Rules. The following year, a New Zealand party went to Australia and the first club competition was held in Queensland. In 1888 the Melbourne Rugby Union was formed in Victoria. In 1892, the rugby bodies in Australia dropped Southern and Northern from their titles, adopting New South Wales and Queensland respectively. That year the first British and Irish Lions tour was carried out. Although unsanctioned by official bodies in Europe, the 21-man squad went to both Australia and New Zealand.\nIn 1899, the national team of Australia played their first match, and the Hospital's Cup became an annual competition in Queensland.\n1900s to 1940s.\nAustralia played its first test against New Zealand in 1903 in front of a crowd of 30,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1907, Australia again played New Zealand, at the same venue as the 1903 match, with crowd numbers reaching 50,000. This figure would not be surpassed again in Australian rugby union until after the game turned professional.\nThe British Isles team visited Australia in 1904 and 1908, and at the 1908 Summer Olympics, the Australian team defeated England to win the gold medal in rugby. That same year, the New South Wales Rugby League broke away from the NSWRU, with the Queensland Rugby League following suit from the QRU in 1909.\nAn event that was to greatly shape rugby union's future in Australia was the onset of World War I in 1914. Rugby competitions were suspended due to an overwhelmingly high percentage of rugby players enlisting to serve in the Australian Imperial Force.\nThe enlistment of rugby players was so quick and extensive that, by 1915, a Sydney newspaper reported: \"According to figures prepared by Mr W. W. Hill, secretary of the New South Wales Rugby Union, 197 out of 220 regular first grade players are on active service, or 90 percent.\"\nWeakened by the loss of its players to the war effort, the Queensland Rugby Union was dissolved in 1919. It was not until 1928 that the union was re-formed and the Brisbane clubs and Great Public Schools returned to playing the rugby union code.\nIn 1931, Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe, as Governor of New Zealand, donated a sporting trophy called the Bledisloe Cup for competition between Australia and New Zealand. The first game was held that year at Eden Park, though the official start of the competition is disputed between that game and the 1932 New Zealand tour to Australia.\nUntil the late 1940s, the administration of the Australian team, including all tours, was handled by New South Wales, being the senior union. A national body, the Australian Rugby Football Union was formed at a conference in Sydney in 1945, acting initially in an advisory capacity only, and in 1949 was formally constituted and joined the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB), representing Australia.\nApparently Australian rugby union then existed in a state of suspended animation until the 1980s.\n1980s to present.\nIn 1987, the first ever Rugby World Cup was held in both Australia and New Zealand, as a result of both the respective rugby bodies putting forth the idea to the IRB. Australia was defeated by France in the semifinal stage.\nThe 1991 Rugby World Cup took place in Europe, and saw Australia defeat England 12-6 in the Final, winning their first world cup after having triumphed over their fierce rivals New Zealand in the semifinal. \nWith rugby union becoming an openly professional sport in 1995, after more than a century of a professed amateur status, major changes were seen in both the club and international game. The Super 12 rugby competition was born that year. The tournament involved 12 provincial sides from three countries; New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. Australia entered three sides into the competition; ACT Brumbies, Queensland Reds and the New South Wales Waratahs. The year also saw the first Tri Nations Series, between the three Super 12 countries.\nIn 1999, the Bledisloe Cup match between Australia and New Zealand was staged at the Homebush Olympic Stadium, now known as ANZ Stadium. The game attracted a then world record crowd for a rugby union match of 107,042 to see Australia win with its greatest margin over New Zealand by 28–7. In 2000 this record was raised again when a crowd of 109,874 witnessed the 'Greatest ever Rugby Match'. New Zealand took an early lead of 24-nil after 11 minutes only to see Australia draw level at 24 all by half time, and the match was decided by a Jonah Lomu try to finish in favour of New Zealand by 39–35.\nThe Wallabies were champions of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, claiming their second Webb Ellis Cup trophy. In doing this, Australia became the first team to win multiple world cups.\nThe year 2003 saw the staging of the Rugby World Cup in Australia. The fifth Rugby World Cup was held in various Australian cities from October to November in 2003. Matches were played all across the country, in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Townsville, Gosford, Wollongong and Launceston. The tournament was hailed as a huge success, an estimated 40,000 international spectators travelled to Australia for the event, some estimations said that a $100 million may have been injected into the Australian economy. The Australian Rugby Union said that revenues exceeded all expectations, the tournament surplus was estimated to be at $44.5 million. The hosting of the World Cup in Australia also saw an increase in Super 12 crowds and junior participation. In 2005, to celebrate a decade of professional rugby union in Australia, the Wallaby Team of the Decade was announced.\nOrganisation.\nRugby union in Australia is governed by Rugby Australia, which is a member of World Rugby (WR). There are constituent state and territory unions with the New South Wales Rugby Union and Queensland Rugby Union traditionally being the dominant members, reflecting the games higher status in these states. However, every state and territory in Australia is represented by their respective union, and in recent years, the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union has elevated itself to competitive equality with NSW and Queensland—though not in governance, as NSW and Queensland have more representatives on the ARU board than the other state and territorial unions. Rugby Australia was formed in 1949 as the Australian Rugby Union; before this time the NSWRU was responsible for international fixtures for Australian teams.\nRugby Union Players Association.\nPast and present professional Australian rugby players are represented by the Rugby Union Players Association.\nParticipation.\nIn 2000, figures from World Rugby (then the IRB) show there were just over 38,000 registered adult rugby union players in Australia, of which the states of New South Wales and Queensland accounted for 82.3% of all senior players. The highest participation rate was 0.8%, in the Australian Capital Territory.\nThe Rugby Au Annual Report 2019 records participation figures for club XV as 85,059 and club 7s as 32,119 resulting in a total club rugby participation figure of 117,178. \nRugby in Australia has enjoyed traditional support within inter-school competitions with the first school match being played by Newington College against Sydney University in 1869. Major rugby playing independent school sports associations include Great Public Schools Association of Queensland, Associated Southern Colleges, Athletic Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales, Combined Associated Schools and Independent Schools Association (Australia). The most renowned of these competitions in New South Wales being the GPS involving The King's School, St Ignatius' College, Riverview and St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill. \nWhilst regularly positioned as an exclusively private school sport, 61% of schools delivering Rugby programs in 2018 were government schools. In a concerted effort to build game awareness and increase club participation opportunities, Rugby AU has engaged in a National Schools Strategy to grow school based XV participation (to link with local clubs) that saw five new XV competitions launched in 2019 alone for students attending 17 non-traditional Rugby schools. As at 2019, the total number of school students playing either XV or 7s rugby was almost 60,000. \nAustralian Schools representative sides have been selected since 1969 with that year's team having toured South Africa. The Australian Schools Rugby Union is an independent incorporated association run by volunteer members of the teaching profession and supporters who believe rugby has a unique ethos and benefits that contribute to the broader education of young people. The association first ran the Australian Schools Championship in 1975 and since then some 170 schools representatives have gone on to play for the Wallabies with countless more representing their State or playing professionally across the world. \nThe popularity of Rugby for women has been growing steadily in recent years following increased visibility of women's pathways and representative teams such as Buildcorp Wallaroos and national 7s teams. As at 2019, females account for approximately 27% of total playing participation.\nNational teams.\nWallabies.\nThe Wallabies is Australia's national rugby union team. Australia has won the World Cup on two occasions, in 1991 against England in England, and then again in 1999 in Wales against France. The team plays in green and gold, which have traditionally been Australia's sporting colours. Australia has been playing internationals since 1899, when they played a visiting British Isles team on 24 June, defeating them by 13 points to 3.\nThe Wallabies play in the Southern Hemisphere's principal international competition. From 1996 through 2011, this was the Tri Nations, also involving the New Zealand All Blacks and the South Africa Springboks. Since 2012, the tournament has been renamed The Rugby Championship and features the Argentina Pumas.\nThe rivalry with the New Zealand All Blacks is considered the marquee rivalry for the game of Rugby in Australia and the teams contest the Bledisloe Cup on an annual basis. The biggest crowd for a Bledisloe match was 109,874 in Sydney.\nIn addition to participating in The Rugby Championship, the Wallabies host Northern Hemisphere sides in the \"July Window\" such as France, England, Ireland etc., and tour to the Northern Hemisphere in the \"November Window\". Whilst the July Window will usually see a series of test matches played against one foreign team such as the 2021 French three-test-tour, the end of year tours will generally see a number of one-off games against different national sides. End of year tour games above the three required by World Rugby can generate as much as $1.5 million in revenue for Rugby AU. \nWallaroos.\nThe women's team, the Wallaroos have been playing international rugby since 1994, and have competed at four Women's Rugby World Cups. Their best finish was third in 2010.\nOther representative teams.\nAustralia A.\nAustralia A is a team of players who are being developed as future Wallaby players. They play matches against touring teams as well as compete in the Pacific Nations Cup.\nSevens.\nAustralia also has a successful sevens team which competes in the World Rugby Sevens Series, Rugby World Cup Sevens and the Commonwealth Games. They have won the Hong Kong Sevens event on five occasions, and are also a \"core team\" that participates in all rounds of the Sevens World Series.\nThe country has hosted one leg of the Sevens World Series in each season since 2006–07. From 2007 through 2011, the Adelaide Sevens was held in that city in March or April. Starting with the 2011–12 season, the Australian leg moved to the Gold Coast and was renamed the Gold Coast Sevens. In addition, the event moved to November, becoming the first tournament of each season. The tournament moved to October beginning in the 2012–13 season, but remained the season opener through 2014–15. Since the 2015–16 series, the event has been held in Sydney, and is now fourth on the series schedule.\nWomen's Sevens.\nThe women's sevens team were champions of the inaugural Women's World Cup Sevens in 2009. They have also been a core team in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series since its inaugural 2012–13 season, and won the gold medal for inaugural Olympic sevens tournament at Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\nAge-level representation.\nAustralia also has an under 21 side, an under 20 side, an under 19 side and a schoolboys team.\nCompetitions, tournaments and tours.\nInternational tournaments.\nRugby World Cup.\nAustralia co-hosted the first Rugby World Cup, along with New Zealand in 1987. It acted as host for the second time in 2003. Australia has won twice, in 1991 and 1999.\nTri Nations and The Rugby Championship.\nThe Tri Nations Series was an annual tournament held between Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa from 1996 through 2011. With Argentina's entry into the tournament in 2012, the competition has been renamed The Rugby Championship.\nBledisloe Cup.\nThe Bledisloe Cup is a trophy introduced by the Governor General of New Zealand, Lord Bledisloe, in 1947 to honour the rivalry between New Zealand and Australia. The Cup is awarded to the winner of each annual series of test matches played. Matches played at Rugby World Cups do not count towards the competition.\nEnd-of-year tests.\nThe Australian rugby team annually plays a test series against other squads, either at home acting as host nation to visiting teams, or touring overseas.\nRugby's domestic presence in Australia.\nWhen Australia became one of the world's best sides in the 1980s, the team was largely drawn from the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds. The ACT Brumbies had become another strong province by the 1990s and joined the Super 12 competition with the Waratahs and Reds in 1996, playing against the top rugby provinces from New Zealand and South Africa. The Western Force, based in Perth, joined the competition in 2006 when it expanded to become the Super 14, and the Melbourne Rebels were added when it became Super Rugby in 2011.\nThe strongholds of the game are still in New South Wales and Queensland where rugby football, initially rugby union and later rugby league, has been the dominant code since the 1880s. Rugby was introduced to other cities and regions at around the same time but Melbourne rules (now Australian football) was preferred in the southern states. Rugby union had a diminished national profile for many decades after rugby league became the more popular football code in Sydney and Brisbane prior to the first world war. The game gradually expanded its reach again after the second world war, and rugby union was re-established in most areas of the country by the 1970s, however rugby league is by far the more dominant code in NSW, Victoria and Queensland.\nSuper Rugby.\nAfter many changes in format, Super Rugby now involves five Australian sides (Queensland Reds, New South Wales Waratahs, ACT Brumbies, Melbourne Rebels, and Western Force), along with 5 New Zealand sides and two Pacific Island teams. The reigning champions are a New Zealand side the Crusaders. \nPrior to the creation of professional Super Rugby in 1996, there were a number of other Oceania-African competitions that featured representative teams from both Queensland and New South Wales, such as the Super 10 competition, which Queensland won twice. Before that there was the South Pacific Championship, also known as the Super 6. State teams have been playing each other since the late 1800s, when Queensland first took on New South Wales in Sydney. The Australian Provincial Championship (APC) was also played in 2006, featuring the Australian Super 14 teams.\nNational Rugby Championship.\nIn late 2013, Rugby Australia (then known as the Australian Rugby Union) announced plans to launch a new domestic competition to be known as the National Rugby Championship (NRC) with the goal of bridging the gap between club rugby and Super Rugby. Originally expected to involve 10 teams, and ultimately unveiled in March 2014 with nine teams, the NRC began play in August 2014, with the season running through to November. The inaugural NRC teams included four in NSW, two in Queensland and one each in Canberra, Melbourne and Perth. After the 2016 season, one of the NSW teams was dropped from the competition and was replaced by the Fijian Drua, an effective developmental side for the Fiji national team. The competition was disbanded in 2020.\nThe country's previous attempt to launch a national domestic competition came in 2007 in the form of the Australian Rugby Championship (ARC). It included eight teams in all, with a geographic distribution almost identical to that of the first three seasons of the NRC, with the exception of one fewer NSW team. The aim of the competition, scheduled to run from August finishing in October with the final, was similar to that of the NRC. The ARU scrapped the competition for the 2008 season due to the union suffering an A$4.7 million loss.\nClub competitions.\nEach major city and many country areas support club rugby competitions in Australia. The club competitions in NSW and Queensland are the oldest and most prestigious. The NSWRU runs the Shute Shield, the highest level in New South Wales along with also running the NSW Country Championships played by regional representative teams from country areas in NSW. Similarly the QRU runs the Queensland Premier Rugby competition, which is the top Brisbane club competition, as well as the Queensland Country Championships for representative teams in the major regions of greater Queensland. All other states also run their own club competitions of varying strength, but the NSW and Queensland competitions have historically been regarded as the major domestic competitions below Super Rugby and are now the major level below the NRC.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe Nine Network owns the broadcast rights to the majority of major Australian and Southern Hemisphere competitions and airs them on through streaming service Stan, as well as providing select coverage on its free-to-air television channels. \nWithin the first year of the new deal, Super Rugby games were regularly gathering more than 120 000 on 9Gem and Stan Sport had more than 250 000 subscribers. The Super Rugby AU Final between Queensland and the ACT pulled more than 1.3 million viewers across all platforms. Rugby Australia Chairman Hamish McLennan hailed it as a turning point for the sport. 2023 figures are 71,000 for Round 1 of Super Rugby 2023. "

        "title": "2006 World Series",
        "text": "The 2006 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2006 season. The 102nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals; the Cardinals won the series in five games to win their tenth World Series championship. This was the third World Series meeting between the Tigers and the Cardinals, the first in 38 years. The Cardinals won the first in , and the Tigers won the second in ; each went the full seven games.\nIt was only the fifth time in 40 years that the Series featured two teams that had both remained in the same city since the formation of the AL in 1901, the last time being the 2004 World Series between St. Louis and the Boston Red Sox. The last three prior to 2004 were in (Boston–Cincinnati), 1968 (Detroit–St. Louis) and (Boston–St. Louis).\nThe Cardinals, who moved into Busch Stadium III in April, became the fourth team to win the Series in their home stadium's debut season, joining the Pittsburgh Pirates (Forbes Field), Boston Red Sox (Fenway Park) and New York Yankees (Yankee Stadium I). In 2009, they would be joined by the New York Yankees (Yankee Stadium II). With this win, the Cardinals would join the Yankees on becoming only the 2nd team in MLB history to win 10 World Series Championships. It also marked the franchise's first World Championship since . Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who won the 1989 World Series title with the Athletics, became the second manager in history to lead teams in both leagues to championships, joining Sparky Anderson. Tigers manager Jim Leyland, who won the 1997 World Series title with the Marlins, also could have become the second manager in history to lead teams in both leagues to championships, had the Tigers won the series.\nThe Cardinals finished the regular season 83–78. This is the second-worst record ever for a league champion (the 1973 New York Mets finished 82–79) and the worst record ever for a World Series champion. Previously the 1987 Minnesota Twins finished 85–77 and defeated that year's Cardinals team in the 1987 World Series.\nBackground.\nA pair of battered ballclubs.\nSince Interleague Play began in 1997, this marked the third time a World Series would be a rematch of the regular season. The Tigers swept the Cardinals in three games at Comerica Park from June 23–25.\nNeither team was given much chance to advance far into October by many baseball pundits. Both teams stumbled through the second halves of their seasons. The Tigers, only three years removed from having the most losses in a season by an AL team and enjoying their first successful season after 12 years of futility, surprised the baseball world by building a ten-game lead in the American League Central, but eventually the lead evaporated in the final months and they lost the division to the Minnesota Twins on the last day of the season after being swept by the last-place Kansas City Royals at home, settling for a playoff berth as the AL Wild Card. The Cardinals held a seven-game advantage in the National League Central over the Cincinnati Reds and an -game lead over the Houston Astros with just two weeks to play. However, the combination of a seven-game losing streak by St. Louis and an eight-game winning streak by the Astros (highlighted by a four-game sweep of the Cardinals in Houston) caused the Cardinals' lead to shrink to half a game with only a few games left. However, the Cardinals held on to clinch the division after an Astros' loss to the Atlanta Braves on the last day of the season.\nThus, both the Tigers and Cardinals were clear underdogs in their matches, against the New York Yankees and San Diego Padres, respectively. The Tigers' pitching took care of the vaunted Yankees lineup, and won their series 3–1. The Cardinals also won their series 3–1, including the first two games in San Diego. The Tigers then swept the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS, winning game four on a three-run walk-off home run by Magglio Ordóñez in the bottom of the ninth. The Cardinals won their series against the New York Mets with the help of a ninth-inning home run by Yadier Molina in a tense Game 7.\nThe Tigers had home-field advantage in the Series, due to the AL's 3–2 win over the NL in the 77th Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 11 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. These two teams had already played against each other in a three-game series in June 2006, where the Tigers swept the Cardinals 3–0 in Detroit, part of an eight-game Cardinals losing streak. This was the first time since 2000 that teams meeting during the regular season met again in the World Series.\nThe Series marked the third time in a row that both teams sought to win a championship after at least a 20-year drought. In 2004, the Boston Red Sox ended their 86-year hiatus by defeating the Cardinals; in 2005 the Chicago White Sox ended an 88-year drought by defeating the Houston Astros, who were competing in their first World Series after 43 seasons. The Tigers had not appeared in the World Series since winning it in 1984. The Cardinals last won in 1982, losing three times since then, in 1985, 1987 and 2004.\nThe Tigers were the eighth wild card team to compete in the World Series since MLB introduced the wild card in 1994. A wild-card team participated in the Series from 2002 to 2007.\nRiding the momentum they built up during their surprisingly easy ALDS and ALCS victories, Detroit entered the Series as a prohibitive favorite. Bob Nightengale of \"USA Today\" expressed popular sentiment when he said \"Tigers in \"three\"\".\nTwo veteran managers return to postseason play.\nSt. Louis' manager Tony La Russa joined his mentor, Sparky Anderson, as only the second manager to win the World Series with teams in both leagues. La Russa won in with the Athletics. Coincidentally, Anderson first accomplished the feat by managing Detroit to their previous championship in 1984. He was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2. If the Tigers had defeated the Cardinals, Jim Leyland would have joined Anderson for this feat instead of LaRussa as he had already won the 1997 World Series with the Florida Marlins. When he came to St. Louis, La Russa wore number 10 to symbolize the team's drive to their 10th championship and pay tribute to Anderson, who wore number 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds. After winning the championship, he chose to continue wearing number 10 to pay tribute to Anderson.\nJim Leyland is the seventh manager to win pennants in both leagues. The previous six are Joe McCarthy (1929 Cubs and the Yankees of 1932, 1936–39 and 1941–43), Yogi Berra (1964 Yankees, 1973 Mets), Alvin Dark (1962 Giants, 1974 A's), Sparky Anderson (1970, 1972, 1975–76 Reds, 1984 Tigers), Dick Williams (1967 Red Sox, 1972–73 A's, 1984 Padres), and Tony La Russa (1988–90 A's, 2004, 2006 Cardinals).\nAdditionally, the opposing managers are close friends. Leyland was La Russa's third base coach for the Chicago White Sox in the early 1980s. Leyland also served as a Pittsburgh-based advance scout for the Cardinals before he was hired by the Tigers.\nThis was the first World Series in 22 years to have two previous World Series-winning managers facing each other, but at the helms of new teams. As previously mentioned, Leyland previously won the 1997 World Series with the Florida Marlins, and La Russa won the 1989 World Series with the Oakland Athletics. Overall, it was the first World Series since to have two previous Series-winning managers facing each other.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nTwo rookies faced off in Game 1 for the first time in history: Anthony Reyes for St. Louis and Justin Verlander for Detroit. It looked like the Tigers were going to get to Reyes early in the bottom of the first, when Craig Monroe doubled and Magglio Ordóñez walked. Carlos Guillén singled Monroe in, giving the Tigers a 1–0 lead. However, in the top of the second, Scott Rolen hit a long home run to left field, tying the score at 1–1. Rolen was 0-for-15 in his career in the World Series before hitting the home run. The previous mark had been 0-for-13, set by Benny Kauff of the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series. In the third inning the Cards broke through, first when Chris Duncan's RBI double scored Yadier Molina to give the Cardinals the lead. On Verlander's next pitch, 2005 National League MVP Albert Pujols banged a two-run home run, punishing the rookie who elected to pitch to the dangerous Pujols, rather than walk him with first base open and two outs and pitch to Jim Edmonds.\nMeanwhile, Anthony Reyes was the story. The pitcher who had the fewest regular season wins of a Game 1 World Series starter (5) at one point retired 17 in a row from the first inning to the sixth inning, a World Series record for a rookie. The previous record was thirteen (John Stuper, STL, 1982, and Dickey Kerr, CHW, 1919). Reyes' final line was eight-plus innings, four hits, two runs, and four strikeouts. The Cards took advantage of Detroit's mistakes again in the sixth, when Brandon Inge made two errors in one play. With runners on second and third, Inge threw to home wild to score a run and then obstructed Scott Rolen, who was running home, to score another run. Craig Monroe hit a home run off Reyes in the bottom of the ninth, which led to Reyes being pulled from the game, as Braden Looper came in to finish the game. The final score was 7–2 Cardinals, marking the first time since 2003 that the National League had won a World Series game, and the first World Series game won by St. Louis since Game 5 of the 1987 World Series.\nGame 2.\nBefore the game's start, John Mellencamp and Little Big Town performed \"Our Country\". With a starting temperature of , controversy surrounded the start of Game 2 when Tigers starting pitcher Kenny Rogers was found to have a substance on a patch of the palm of his pitching hand during the first inning. Although Cardinals hitters claimed that the ball was doing \"weird things\" in the first inning, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa did not request an inspection of Rogers' hand to determine what the substance was. Rogers claimed it was a combination of dirt and rosin (both legal), but complied with a request from the umpires to wash his hands before the second inning.\nUnfazed, Rogers would go on to pitch eight shutout innings while surrendering only two hits, running his postseason streak to 23 straight shutout innings. Craig Monroe hit his second home run in the series, and Carlos Guillén, who was a home run away from the cycle, and Sean Casey each drove in runs to give the Tigers a 3–0 lead going into the ninth. Todd Jones then came into the game to close it out but got into a heavy jam (he had an error which contributed to the jam), with Scott Rolen being driven in by Jim Edmonds before a force-out at second with the bases loaded won the game for the Tigers. Craig Monroe became the fifth player to hit a home run in each of his first two World Series games. The others were Barry Bonds for the Giants in 2002, Ted Simmons for the Brewers in 1982, Dusty Rhodes for the New York Giants in 1954, and Jimmie Foxx for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1929.\nSt. Louis pitcher Jeff Weaver (the same Yankees pitcher who surrendered the walk-off home run in game 4 of the 2003 World Series) surrendered all three Detroit runs in his five innings of work and took the loss for the Cardinals.\nGame 3.\nAfter the Cardinals were shut out by Detroit pitcher Kenny Rogers for eight innings in Game 2, St. Louis starter Chris Carpenter answered with eight innings of his own in a 5–0 Cardinals victory in Game 3. Carpenter, making his World Series debut (he missed the entire 2004 World Series due to injury) gave up only three hits, struck out six and did not issue a walk, while throwing only 82 pitches. Only one Tiger reached second base.\nSt. Louis began the scoring in the fourth inning on a bases-loaded two-run double by center fielder Jim Edmonds off of Nate Robertson. Two more runs would score in the bottom of the seventh on an error by Detroit pitcher Joel Zumaya, who overthrew third baseman Brandon Inge on what should have been a routine force out. St. Louis would add another run in the eighth on a wild pitch.\nReliever Braden Looper would pitch a perfect ninth to close out the game and give St. Louis a two-games-to-one advantage in the Series.\nThe Cardinals became the first team since the Cincinnati Reds in 1970 to host a World Series game in their first season in a new ballpark.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 was pushed back a day because of rain, the first time a rainout had occurred in the World Series since Game 1 in 1996. The fans from the game were to attend Game 5. (Thus, fans who had tickets for Game 5 went to Game 4 instead.) The Cardinals won, taking a 3–1 series lead. The starters were Jeff Suppan for the Cardinals and Jeremy Bonderman for the Tigers. The Tigers took a 3–0 lead into the top of the third, after Sean Casey had two RBIs, including a home run. The other RBI came from Detroit's Iván Rodríguez, who singled in Carlos Guillén. Rodriguez, who had been hitless in the previous three games, also went 3-for-4. In the bottom of the third, the \nCardinals struck back with a run-scoring double by David Eckstein, scoring Aaron Miles who had the first stolen base of the series by either team. Yadier Molina doubled in Scott Rolen in the fourth to cut the Tiger lead to 3–2. The score remained that way, until the bottom of the seventh, when Eckstein led off with a double over the head of Curtis Granderson, who had slipped on the wet Busch Stadium outfield grass. Eckstein then scored on an attempted sacrifice bunt by So Taguchi that was thrown over the head of second baseman Plácido Polanco, who was covering first by Fernando Rodney, and that tied the score at three. Later that same inning, Preston Wilson hit a single to left with two outs that scored Taguchi from third and Rodney was charged with a blown save. The Tigers tied the game in the top of the eighth on a Brandon Inge double that scored Iván Rodríguez. Adam Wainwright, the winning pitcher, was charged with a blown save but held on to win. In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Cardinals would regain and keep the lead when Miles scored on a double by Eckstein just off the glove of outfielder Craig Monroe, who had been playing shallow and dove for a ball just out of his reach. This gave Joel Zumaya the loss.\nGame 5.\nOn a day in which it rained much of the day but stopped early enough so that the lack of a dome did not delay the game, the Cardinals won to clinch the championship four games to one, making this the first five-game series since the Yankees–Mets Series in . The starter for Detroit was game 1 loser Justin Verlander and the Cardinals starter was game 2 loser Jeff Weaver. Weaver got an extra day of rest to avoid pitching on three days rest.\nJustin Verlander pitched a sloppy first inning for Detroit, walking three and tying a World Series record for a single inning by throwing two wild pitches. He avoided allowing any runs, however, thanks to a good play by shortstop Carlos Guillén to get the third out on what was almost an infield hit.\nThe Cardinals took the lead in the second inning on a lead-off single by Yadier Molina followed by two advancing groundouts, and then an infield single by David Eckstein. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge made a good play to stop the ball off Eckstein's bat, but then made a poor throw to first which got by first baseman Sean Casey and allowed Eckstein to advance to second. The throwing error was the seventh error of the series by the Tigers, also giving them at least one error in every game to that point.\nCardinals pitcher Jeff Weaver (an ex-Tiger) was cruising into the fourth inning, and he appeared to be nowhere near trouble with a lead-off groundout by Guillen, followed by a routine popup by Magglio Ordóñez. This popup turned out to be much more troublesome than it first appeared: right fielder Chris Duncan dropped the ball, apparently distracted by center fielder Jim Edmonds who was also going after the ball. With Ordóñez on via the error, the very next pitch of the game was hit by the hot-hitting Sean Casey into the right-field seats just inside the foul pole for a two-run homer that gave Detroit the lead, 2–1. The Cardinals would threaten immediately in the bottom of the inning, however, with Yadier Molina and So Taguchi each singling to put runners at first and second with one out. Pitcher Jeff Weaver then came up and attempted to bunt the runners over to second and third. The bunt was fielded cleanly by the pitcher Justin Verlander, but he attempted to force out Molina at third. The throw missed third baseman Brandon Inge and the ball went into the left-field foul area. This allowed Molina to score to tie it up, with Taguchi and Weaver arriving safely at third and second. Later, Verlander said \"I picked it up and said, Don't throw it away, instead of just throwing it. I got tentative.\" The throwing error by Verlander was the fifth error by Detroit pitchers in the World Series, having committed one per game, setting a new World Series record. (A placard held by a Cardinals fan in the stands read \"HIT IT TO THE PITCHER\"). The next batter, David Eckstein, grounded out to score the runner from third, and St. Louis secured their lead, 3–2. Verlander kept Weaver from scoring by retiring Chris Duncan, but the damage was already done.\nChris Duncan misplayed another ball in the top of the sixth for a Sean Casey two-out double, but this time Casey would be stranded as Iván Rodríguez then struck out to end the inning. A David Eckstein single followed by a Preston Wilson walk in the bottom of the seventh put runners at first and second with none out for the heart of the Cardinals order: Pujols, Edmonds, and Rolen. Pujols popped out and Edmonds flied out, so it appeared Detroit might hold the Cardinals to a one-run lead. Instead, Scott Rolen singled and scored Eckstein, doubling the Cardinals lead to 4–2. Fernando Rodney, who gave up the single to Rolen and was charged with the run, managed to retire Ronnie Belliard to end the inning.\nJeff Weaver retired the side in order, and the Cardinals went to the ninth, three outs away from their first World Series title in 24 years. The man called on to get those three outs would be Adam Wainwright, who had won the job of closer after the star free agent brought to St. Louis in 2002, Jason Isringhausen, had season-ending surgery. Detroit's clean-up hitter, Magglio Ordóñez, led off the inning. He proceeded to work a full count but then grounded out. The second batter, Sean Casey, worked a full count and then doubled to bring the tying run to the plate. The third batter, Iván Rodríguez, got ahead in the count 2–0 but grounded back to Wainwright on the next pitch, putting the Cardinals one out away. The fourth batter, Plácido Polanco (who was hitless during the entire series), fell behind 1–2, but then worked a walk to put the tying run on. The fifth batter, Brandon Inge, fell behind 0–2, again putting the Cardinals one strike from a World Series championship. He did not extend the drama any longer, as he swung and missed at the next pitch (making it the first World Series to end on a strikeout since the 1988 World Series), giving the World Series title to the Cardinals. The final play of the 2006 season was made at 10:26pm Central Standard time. After the game, Wainwright, who threw a curveball for strike three to win the pennant and a slider to Inge to win the Series, said \"I'll probably never throw another curve or slider again without thinking of those two pitches.\"\nComposite line score.\n2006 World Series (4–1): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Detroit Tigers (A.L.)\nBroadcasting.\nThe World Series was televised in the United States by Fox, with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver as the booth announcers. The starting time for each television broadcast was 8:00 pm EDT/7:00 pm CDT.\nOn radio, the Series was broadcast nationally by ESPN Radio, with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan announcing. Locally, Dan Dickerson and Jim Price called the Series for the Tigers on WXYT-AM in Detroit (with retired longtime Tiger announcer Ernie Harwell returning to call the second inning of Game 1), while Mike Shannon and John Rooney called it for the Cardinals on KTRS-AM in St. Louis. Per contractual obligation, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts.\nJohn Rooney had broadcast the 2005 World Series for the Chicago White Sox, and thus became the first announcer to call back-to-back World Series championships as an employee of different teams.\nFox aired commercials supporting and opposing the Missouri Constitutional Amendment during the game.\nRatings.\nThe ratings for the 2006 World Series were considered alarmingly poor at the time. The ratings for games 1, 3 and 4 were the lowest rated games 1, 3, and 4 in World Series history. Game 1, at 8.0, particularly set the record for lowest rated World-Series game of all-time (the 9.4 rating in Game 1 of the 2002 World Series was the prior lowest). The series overall averaged 10.1, sinking below the 11.1 of the 2005 World Series to become the lowest-rated World Series of all time.\nHowever, those numbers look differently today, considering the performances of many of the World Series following 2006. The 10.1 overall rating is now the 8th lowest rated World Series (behind 2012, 2014, 2010, 2008, 2015, 2011, and 2013), and game 1's 8.0 is now the 15th lowest rated game all-time (behind, among others, five games from the 2014 Series). Since 2006, four series (2007, 2009, 2016, and 2017) have outdone the 2006 World Series' ratings.\nAftermath.\nNeither team made the playoffs the next season. The Tigers finished with 88 wins, eight behind the division champion Cleveland Indians in the AL Central, while the Cardinals finished with 78 wins, seven behind the division champion Chicago Cubs in the NL Central. The 2007 Cardinals were the last defending World Series champion to finish with a losing record and miss the playoffs the next season until the San Francisco Giants followed up their 2012 championship season with a 76–86 record in 2013. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt Jr. became enamored of a data-driven analytics and fired long-time general manager Walt Jocketty a day after the 2007 season ended.\nThe Tigers would not make the playoffs again until 2011, when they won the AL Central title for the first time with their last division title being the 1987 AL East crown. The Tigers would win the AL Central in 2012 again and would return to the World Series in 2012 after winning the 2012 American League pennant where they would be swept by the San Francisco Giants in four games. The Cardinals would later make the playoffs in 2009, when the NL Central champions were swept by the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2009 NLDS. The Cardinals also made it to the playoffs as the Wild Card entry in 2011, winning the 2011 National League pennant and going on to beat the Texas Rangers in the 2011 World Series, but failing to defend that title in the 2012 NLCS, losing to the Giants in seven games.\nChris Carpenter, Yadier Molina and Albert Pujols were the only Cardinals to play in both the 2006 and 2011 World Series. Even though Skip Schumaker played a portion of the 2006 season with the Cardinals, he failed to make the postseason roster; however, he later won a World Series with the 2011 Cardinals. Adam Wainwright won a World Series with the 2006 Cardinals, but missed the entire 2011 championship season due to injury.\nOf the Tigers who played in the 2006 World Series (excluding previous World Series winners such as Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers), only Fernando Rodney and Justin Verlander later won a championship ring with other teams: Verlander as a member of both the and Houston Astros, and Rodney as a member of the Washington Nationals, whose team defeated Verlander's Astros.\nIn 2022, Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina, who were the battery that closed out the World Series, broke the record for most games started by a starting pitcher and catcher."

The Cypriot delegation consisted of one alpine skier, Theodoros Christodoulou. His best performance was 34th in the men's giant slalom.\nBackground.\nThe Cyprus Olympic Committee was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 1978, and the nation has participated in every Summer Olympics and Winter Olympic Games since debuting in 1980. At the time of the Turin Olympics, no Cypriot athlete had ever won a medal. They would win their first medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics six years after Turin. This was their eighth appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The only athlete sent by Cyprus to Turin was an alpine skier, Theodoros Christodoulou. He was the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nTheodoros Christodoulou was 28 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and had previously represented Cyprus at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

This was Macedonia's third appearance at a Winter Olympic Games. The delegation consisted of three athletes; Ivana Ivčevska and Gjorgi Markovski in alpine skiing, and Darko Damjanovski in cross-country skiing. Their best performance in any event was 40th, by Ivčevska in the women's giant slalom.\nBackground.\nThe Olympic Committee of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 1 January 1993.

The country's participation at the Games marked its Winter Olympics debut, although it had competed in the Summer Olympics since 1964. The delegation consisted of a single alpine skier, Mathieu Razanakolona, who did not win any medals.\nBackground.\nMadagascar first competed at the Summer Olympics at the 1964 Games in Tokyo, Japan. They participated on nine occasions prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics, where they made their Winter Olympics debut in Turin, Italy. They sent a single alpine skier, Mathieu Razanakolona.\nRazanakolona was born in Quebec, Canada; his mother was Canadian but his father was from Madagascar. He and his brother Philippe sought to bring international attention to the African island nation of Madagascar by having Mathieu become the first person to represent the country at the Winter Olympics. While Mathieu competed in the skiing, Philippe ran the non-profit organisation rAzAlpin.org to support this. Prior to the Turin Games, Mathieu had competed in a single FIS Alpine Ski World Cup event in Schladming, Austria, where he was disqualified after straddling a gate.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe sole Malagasy athlete at the Games, Mathieu Razanakolona, competed in the men's giant slalom and slalom.

        "title": "Boxing Day shooting",
        "text": "The Boxing Day shooting was a Canadian gang-related shooting which occurred on December 26, 2005, on Toronto's Yonge Street, resulting in the death of 15-year-old student Jane Creba. Six other bystanders—four men and two women—were wounded. The incident took place on one of Toronto's most crowded streets on the very busy shopping day, just a few blocks north of the Toronto Eaton Centre. The story generated national news coverage in Canada and influenced the then-underway 2006 federal election campaign on the issues of gun crime and street violence.\nFatality.\nJane Creba (May 13, 1990 – December 26, 2005), a tenth-grade student at Riverdale Collegiate Institute, was killed in the incident. While shopping with her sister, she was exiting Pizza Pizza on the west side of the street, when the gunfight erupted. One bullet passed through her upper torso, lodging in her clothing; it was later recovered in hospital. She was rushed to St. Michael's Hospital and died during emergency surgery.\nInitial arrests.\nPolice arrested two men on several gun charges at Castle Frank subway station within an hour after the shooting: Andre Thompson, 20, who was on probation at the time, and Jorrell Simpson-Rowe, 17. Thompson had been released just before Christmas from Maplehurst prison near Milton, Ontario, where he had served 30 days for his role in a convenience-store robbery. He declined a bail hearing for his current charges. Police believe as many as 10 to 15 people were involved in the shooting and that more than one gun was fired.\nLater arrests and convictions.\nTwenty Toronto Police detectives were assigned to \"Project Green Apple\" (named after her favourite food) to work on the case. On June 13, 2006, Toronto Police conducted multiple raids at 14 locations throughout Toronto in the early morning, arresting six men and two teenagers. Charges laid against them included manslaughter, second-degree murder, and attempted murder relating to the six other bystanders. All arrested are members of two different street gangs.\nIn October 2007, a young man who was rounded up in the initial arrests, Eric Boateng, was shot dead in a seemingly unconnected incident. Boateng was not charged with the shooting, but was later charged with cocaine trafficking.\nAs of December 2007, ten people have been charged with murder or manslaughter in the case, three of whom are youths. Those charged with second-degree murder include Tyshaun Barnett and Louis Woodcock, both 19, Jeremiah Valentine, 24, and Jorrell Simpson-Rowe, who was 17 at the time of the shootings. One of the teenagers who was arrested in June and charged with manslaughter was exonerated on October 25, 2007 after the preliminary hearing. The teenager charged with murder was committed to trial.\nOn December 7, 2008, Jorrell Simpson-Rowe, previously known as JSR because the \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\" forbids disclosure of identities of minors, was convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree. In April 2009, he was sentenced as an adult to life in prison with no chance of parole for seven years.\nIn November 2009, manslaughter charges against four individuals involved in the incident were dropped because the prosecutors \"felt there were no reasonable prospects for conviction\". The four were alleged by prosecutors to have had a \"common unlawful purpose\" in the incident, but did not fire a weapon.\nIn December 2009, one decliner, 27-year-old Jeremiah Valentine pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Creba's death and was given a life sentence with no chance of parole for 12 years. And in April 2010, a jury found Louis Woodcock, 23, and Tyshaun Barnett, 22, guilty of manslaughter in the 15-year-old's death, but not guilty of the more serious offence of second-degree murder. They were also found guilty of four counts each of aggravated assault, relating to other people who were wounded by stray bullets that day.\nMedia coverage and community impact.\nThe Boxing Day Shooting was the subject of intense media coverage, particularly after a year in which the city of Toronto recorded 80 homicides and a city record 52 shooting deaths. Only one month earlier on November 18, 2005, Amon Beckles was killed outside the sanctuary of a church while attending the funeral of his friend, Jamal Hemmings, whose shooting death he may have witnessed a week earlier, on Eglinton Avenue between Oakwood and Marlee Avenues in the Eglinton West neighbourhood.\nThe incident was yet another example that led to 2005 being labelled by both the media and police as . Detective Sergeant Savas Kyriacou of the Toronto Police Service spoke for these people in saying, \"Toronto has finally lost its innocence. I think we're going to feel this day for a long time to come.\"\nCreba's death has also caused much controversy over the causes of gun crime and the ways to handle the problem. In 2016, author Anita Arvast published a book outlining the issues with systemic discrimination in the case - specifically the charges, convictions and the representation of the incident as a gang rivalry. Also controversial is the resurgence of the Guardian Angels in Toronto; they arrived in mid-January to visit the city. Toronto street patrols began in July; however, the chapter had run into financial difficulties by September 2006. Some coverage has also analyzed the disproportionate coverage Creba's death received, compared to the similar deaths of numerous men and women of colour."

        "title": "2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony",
        "text": "The Opening Ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics (\"Torino 2006\") was held on 10 February 2006 beginning at 20:00 CET () at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin, Italy.\nThe ceremony was attended by 35,000 spectators with the presence of numerous international and Italian guests on the stage and heads of state and government on the stands. The event was broadcast live to an estimated two-billion audience worldwide by 32 television cameras.\nThe ceremony saluted the region's culture and history, was highlighted by Italian celebrities and showcased Italian designs. There were the customary parade of athletes and raising of the host nation's flag and the Olympic flag. Apart from the choreography, the fireworks, and the pageantry, the ceremony was a reminder of peace as a goal of these Games. It climaxed with the lighting of the Olympic Flame.\nProgram.\nThe theme of the program was \"Passion Lives Here,\" and the 4000m2 stage was shaped like an anatomic heart with a mosh pit in the centre where the athletes congregated for the second half of the ceremonies. The athletes were thus put in the centre of action and in front of the stage, emphasizing that the heart of each athlete was the focus of the Games.\nThere were sentiments of self-conceit amongst TOROC for not including a tribute section during the Opening Ceremonies honoring the Past Host Cities of the previous installments of the Olympic Winter Games that was the very first part of the XIX Olympic Winter Games that had been held in Salt Lake City, USA on 8 February 2002.\nThe ceremony was conducted in French and English, the two official languages of the International Olympic Committee, and Italian, the language of the host country.\nThe program was executed by 6,100 volunteers and 240 professionals after 15,000 man days of work.\nRhythm of Passion.\nSparks of Passion\nThe Opening Ceremonies began with a traditional countdown by the spectators. Italian gymnast Yuri Chechi as a shaman striking an anvil with a hammer opened the first scene of the program representing the industrial past of the Piedmont region. Each strike spewed up a fountain of flames and were responded to with flames over three metres high, lit from 52 nozzles lined up around the piazza. A group of inline skaters in red unitards soon entered and executed their choreograph and formations. With the fire, costume and flood light, the stage was soon turned into a sea of red. In the mosh pit, performers executed synchronised swimming moves to the pulsing rhythm. It was said that the choreographer was inspired by synchronised swimming when he saw the event for the first time in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.\nThe skaters then gyrated to the pulsing rhythm forming a familiar heart shape pumping to the beat. The formation was soon shattered when a lone skater symbolising a spark of passion shot through the beating heart. Six helmet-donning skaters then entered with two-foot flames flared from the back of their helmets and crisscrossed the stage.\nGreetings from the Alps.\nMountain Folk\nFollowing the exit of the flaming skaters, the sounding of seven alphorns to the notes of the \"Occitan Hymn\" signaled the beginning of the next segment that paid tribute to the Alps and the seven Alpine countries: Italy, France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany and Slovenia. Artificial snow and life-size pine tree shapes set the mood for this segment as the stage was transformed from red to white.\nIt had been 14 years since the Winter Olympic Games were last held in the Alps, in 1992 in Albertville, France. The 13 million people living in the mountainous region were represented by dancers waltzing in their national costumes. Life-size cow effigies were pulled in and paraded around the stage representing the significance of the dairy farming industry in the Alpine region. Three waltzing couples in cow suits soon entered the scene, while cow bells were heard ringing from the crowd.\nAfter the stage was cleared, 50 performers in white unitards entered with very large white balloons on their heads symbolising the arrival of the snowflakes. A change of music signalled the exit of the snowflakes and in the mosh pit performers formed a snowflake which was lit up by flashlights as the segment came to a close.\nItaly.\nItalian flag\nEntry of the authorities\nItalian anthem\nThis section paid tribute to the Italian flag, whose entrance was led by 26 Olympic medalists in white suits and gowns marching in two files. Following the athletes was model, singer and future French first lady Carla Bruni carrying a folded Italian flag. Bruni wore a sparkling gown by Giorgio Armani, inspired by crystal and ice.\nThe stage was flooded in the Italian colours red, white, and green by the coloured spotlights at the top of the stadium as the entrance of the President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge and the President of Italy Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was announced.\nSustained drumbeats set a mood as three Carabinieri officers entered and retrieved the flag from Bruni and brought it to the flag pole.\nThe flag was raised to the solo rendition of the Italian national anthem after a short pastoral orchestra introduction (as opposed to the usual marching introduction). \"Il Canto degli Italiani\" was performed by nine-year-old Eleonora Benetti wearing the Italian tricolour. Her verse ended as the choir, conducted by Roberto Bertaina, joined in for the much more rapid refrain.\nTorino Olympic City.\nXX Olympic Winter Games\nThe Great Skier\n467 performers, each wearing one of the 5 Olympic colours, created a 20 meter tall ski jumper formation, after the playing of the Italian national anthem. The choreography showed an animated ski jumper gliding down the take-off slope, flying through the night air and eventually landing safely in perfect form on the ground. Puffs of air could be seen as the jumper prepared his jump. Performers carrying a blue banner then entered to show the skier gliding down the slope. In flight the figure was lit up by headlamp flashlights in a formation of a ski jumper in peak flight. The ski jumper eventually made a graceful landing on the ground as performers released confetti (to represent a snowplow stop) and cheered as the segment came to a close.\nOlympic Spirit.\nCitius, altius, fortius\nThe Sparks of Passion reentered the stadium in this segment where the largest and tallest Olympic Rings for the Opening Ceremonies would be created. Acrobats could be seen maneuvering on three ring shaped frames floating up and down along four lattice columns on the opposite end of the stadium to the stage and the mosh pit. Dancers in red unitards below gyrated to pulsing beats as the theme of passion returned for this segment of the program. While the acrobats descended to the ground, two additional ring shaped frames were raised. The five circular frames were flipped vertically revealing the five Olympic Rings shimmering in light. The rings were then illuminated in the Olympic colours and the structure was lit up in fireworks. The black ring in the centre of the symbol was substituted with white since it is impossible to produce black light.\nHeroes of Our Time - Parade of Nations.\nThe national teams then entered underneath the five-ring structure in the traditional Parade of Nations. As with all Olympic games, the first team to emerge was Greece, since it was the birthplace of the games, and the host nation Italy entered last. The rest of the nations entered following the alphabetical order according to the spelling of the country in Italian, the language of the host country, as is tradition. \nThe names of the nations were announced first in Italian, then in English and followed by French.\nNorth Korea and South Korea marched together under the Unification Flag for the first time in the Winter Olympic Games; this would not happen again (either Summer or Winter) until the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. Altogether, 80 National Olympic Committees participated in the Games, an increase from 77 in the previous Winter Games.\nThe Moschino designed the clothes of the women bearing the placards with team names in Italian for the athletes' parade. The dresses were shaped as snowy mountain tops, complete with pine trees and small houses lit up by embedded lights. Miss Italia, Edelfa Chiara Masciotta, was carrying the placard for team Italy who wore a special dress designed to pay tribute to Turin. When assembled on stage the ladies represented the Italian Alps' beauty, strength, and poise.\nThe march of the Olympic teams was accompanied by a selection of 1970s and 1980s American and European disco music, including \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" by The Buggles, \"YMCA\" by the Village People, \"I Will Survive\" by Gloria Gaynor, \"Daddy Cool\" by Boney M and songs by the Doobie Brothers and Eurythmics among others.\nThe following table lists the countries and territories in the order of their entrance. It is worth noting that not all the athletes participated in the opening ceremonies, as some may have chosen to prepare themselves for races and competitions that were scheduled the very next morning. Other commitments may have prevented some athletes from participating in the parade. For example, most men's hockey teams would not arrive in Turin until the following week since most of the players are involved with the NHL. On the other hand, the parade included officials, judges, coaches and other team staff.\nFrom Renaissance to Baroque.\nAfter a short homage to Dante and \"The Divine Comedy\", there were Renaissance and Baroque displays, with an homage to Arcimboldo. A scene was based on the Birth of Venus painting. The role of Venus was played by Czech supermodel Eva Herzigová, emerging from a shell like in the \"Birth of Venus\" by Botticelli. A dance played a major part in the ceremony, as well as displays of flag waving and baroque bands.\nSportscaster Bob Costas called it a celebration of the emergence from the dark days of the Middle Ages, embracing the intellectual pursuits of art, literature and music.\nFrom Futurism to Future.\nThe segment started with a modern ballet performance which led from a replica of Umberto Boccioni's sculpture \"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\" to a celebration of Futurism.\nRoberto Bolle performed as lead in the dance part. He represented the futuristic hero, dancing with other \"mechanical dancers\" to show modernity, technology, and speed.\nThe second part was performed by kung-fu athletes representing futuristic soldiers, while in the final section a group of bodybuilders pushed 6 motorbikes in the center of the stadium, thus emphasizing the role played by speed and technology in Futurism.\nPit Stop.\nItalian driver Luca Badoer drove the 2005 Ferrari F2005 car bearing only the Olympic Rings, \"Torino 2006\" name and Italian tricolore to the centre of the stadium, performing 'donuts' and revving the V10 engine for a few minutes.\nWords and Symbols.\nAddress by the President of the Organising Committee\nAddress by the President of the International Olympic Committee\nPresident of the Italian Republic: Opening of the Games\nOlympic Anthem\nEntry of the Olympic Flag\nOlympic Oath\nAfter the Parade of Nations had concluded and the athletes were gathered in the center of the stadium, two short speeches in Italian, French and English were delivered.\nThe first speech came from Valentino Castellani, the chief organizer of the Torino 2006 Olympic Games. He declared the industrial city \"the world capital of sports\" during the Olympics.\nValentino Castellani was followed by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, who told the Olympic athletes, \"Your achievements will inspire and motivate future generations,\" before adding, \"Please compete cleanly, without using doping.\" Rogge also hoped for peace during his short speech. \"Our world today is in need of peace and brotherhood, the values of the Olympic Games,\" he said. \"May these Games be held in peace in the true spirit of the Olympic Truce.\"\nRogge then introduced Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who declared the games officially open.\nFollowing the trend set from the selection of eight personalities representing the five continents and the three pillars of Olympism at the Salt Lake City Olympics Opening Ceremony, the flag was brought this time into the stadium by eight women:\nTheir walk with the flag was accompanied by Giuseppe Verdi's \"Triumphant March,\" from Aida. The Olympic flag was then handed over to eight members of the Alpini, an Italian infantry unit, who raised the flag while the Olympic Hymn was played.\nItalian skier Giorgio Rocca recited the Olympic Oath on behalf of all the athletes from the podium followed by Fabio Bianchetti from the International Skating Union reading the oath on behalf of all judges. There had been a major judging controversy in the figure skating event at the previous Winter Games.\nPeace.\nThe Dove\nA Song of Peace\nTwenty-eight acrobats climbed on a net set up on the main stage and executed their choreographed manoeuvres, spinning and flipping to the music. At the end of the routine they all came together and formed the shape of a dove, the symbol of peace, to a roaring cheer from the crowd.\nYoko Ono, dressed in white like many of the people in the ceremony (the spectators were provided with, and most wore, a white poncho, symbolizing the snow which makes the Winter Olympics possible), then entered and read a free verse poem from a prepared script calling for peace in the world. She called for \"taking action\" to spread peace. Ono's poem served as an introduction to a rendition of her late husband John Lennon's \"Imagine\" by Peter Gabriel.\nLight the Passion.\nArrival of the Flame\nLighting of the Cauldron\nThe Olympic System\nThe Olympic Torch entered the stadium in the hand of Alberto Tomba, who then passed the flame to the hands of the 1994 men's Italian cross-country skiing relay team (Marco Albarello, Giorgio Vanzetta, Maurilio De Zolt, and Silvio Fauner). The flame was then passed to Piero Gros, then Deborah Compagnoni before the Olympic Flame was lit by former Italian cross-country skier Stefania Belmondo. Belmondo paused to show the torch to the cheering crowd one last time before placing it on the arched lighting apparatus. The flame initiated a series of fireworks before lighting the top of the 57-meter high Olympic Flame, the highest in the history of the Olympic Winter Games.\nThe cauldron lighting was also the first in recent memory to be lit indirectly, that is, the flame did not directly touch or travel to (such as the arrow lighting at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona) the cauldron itself. The precise timing of the pyrotechnics was obviously computer timed from the precise moment the flame touched the center frame in the center of the stadium. Because of the elaborate fireworks, it is highly unlikely the flame travelled to all the charges directly. However, it is possible that the cauldron was lit from a backup flame inside, or that an electronic signal from Belmondo's apparatus to the cauldron served as the \"flame\" (much like the 1976 Summer Olympics where a satellite signal carried the \"flame\" from Greece to Canada, though not at the opening ceremony).\nFortissimo.\nAllegro with Fire\nAfter the largest curtain yet to be built revealed him on the stage, Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti, wearing a black cape embroidered with silver Olympic rings, ended the ceremony by singing Giacomo Puccini's well-known aria \"Nessun Dorma\" from the opera \"Turandot\", which ends with the victorious line \"At dawn, I shall win!\" Pavarotti's performance caused NBC Olympic commentator Brian Williams to proclaim \"And the master brings the house down.\" Indeed, the tenor's performance received the longest and loudest ovation of the opening ceremony from the international crowd. This would prove to be Pavarotti's final public performance of his signature song.\nSecurity measures.\nSecurity was present at the Opening Ceremony as has become the norm for the Olympics. Organizers stepped up the security measures in connection with the contemporary Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and they insisted that the Olympic Games would be safe.\nDignitaries and other officials in attendance.\nAside from celebrities participating in the ceremonies, President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge and members of the IOC, many dignitaries and officials associated with the Olympic movement were in attendance (included 13 world leaders and 2 first ladies). They included :\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was absent. However he attended the Closing Ceremony on 26 February."

The only competitor sent by the USVI was Anne Abernathy, who broke her wrist in a practice run and was therefore unable to compete.\nBackground.\nThe Virgin Islands Olympic Committee was first recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1966. The USVI have sent competitors to every Summer Olympic Games since, excepting the boycotted 1980 Moscow Olympics.

I’m passionate about my sport … I’m not over the hill.\"\nLuge.\nAnne Abernathy, known by the nickname \"Grandma Luge\", was 52 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics. Abernathy was the oldest female athlete at these Olympics. About her age, she said, \"It's a big deal for a lot of women that someone over 50 is going out there and doing it.\" She had represented the Virgin Islands at the five proceeding Winter Olympics. She was forced out of the women's singles competition due to a broken wrist suffered in her fifth training run on 12 February. Initially left off the start list entirely, a three-judge panel of the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on 17 February 2006 that she should officially be recorded as \"Did Not Start\". The other female lugers gifted her a signed start number 31, with Michelle Despain of Argentina writing \"Thank you for your example, Anne.\" In the competition, the Germans swept the medals; Sylke Otto won gold; Silke Kraushaar-Pielach took the silver, and Tatjana Hüfner won the bronze."

        "text": "Chinese Taipei sent a delegation to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy from 10–26 February 2006. Although the nation is known as Taiwan or the Republic of China, the International Olympic Committee mandates that the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag and name is used, and not the flag of Taiwan, as per the Nagoya Resolution. This was Chinese Taipei's seventh time participating in the Winter Olympic Games. The Chinese Taipei delegation consisted of a single athlete, luger Ma Chih-hung. He finished 28th in the men's singles.\nBackground.\nFollowing the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of China retained control of only Taiwan island and a few other minor islands. After international recognition shifted to the People's Republic of China in the 1970s and under the People's Republic's One China policy, the only way the Republic of China could participate in international organizations was under a name acceptable to the People's Republic. Nevertheless, the Republic of China was allowed to compete under that name at the 1972 Winter Olympics and the 1976 Winter Olympics. The Republic of China boycotted the Olympics in 1976 and 1980 after not being allowed to compete under the name \"Republic of China\" Chinese Taipei accepted the Nagoya Resolution in 1981 and first officially participated in the Olympics at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Chinese Taipei has sent delegations to every Winter Olympic Games since, making Turin their seventh appearance at a Winter Olympics. Their delegation to Turin consisted of a single competitor in luge, Ma Chih-hung. He was accompanied to Turin by coaches and teammates to act as logistical support. Ma was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony while a volunteer carried the flag for the closing ceremony.\nLuge.\nMa Chih-hung was 20 years old at the time of the Turin Olympics, and was making his debut Olympic appearance. The men's singles was held on 11–12 February, with two runs contested on each day. On the first day, he posted times of 53.939 seconds and 53.605 seconds. At the close of the first day, he was in 31st place. The next day he posted run times of 53.977 seconds and 53.62 seconds. Although he did not finish in the top 30 in any individual run, his consistency across the four runs saw him end up with a total time of 3 minutes and 35.141 seconds, which placed him 28th overall. Ma would go on to represent Chinese Taipei again at the 2010 Winter Olympics."

The film is notable for the many innovative techniques that Vigo uses, including close ups and freeze frames of the swimmer's body.\nAt the end of 1930, Vigo was commissioned by the Gaumont Film Company to direct a short film about swimming, centred on the French champion Jean Taris. Most of the film was shot at the Automobile Club de France, where the swimming pool had glass portholes through which underwater shots could be taken.\nIn the film’s 56 shots, Vigo fulfils his commission by concentrating mainly on a demonstration of the crawl. However, he also introduces several unexpected and avant-garde effects, including a woman practising swimming strokes while lying flat on a stool out of the pool, with a life guard in attendance; slow motion underwater shots; a dive and a jump run backwards, so the swimmer flies out of the water; and Taris’s swimsuit dissolving to be replaced by a suit, overcoat and hat, in which he walks across the water.\nAlthough Vigo disliked the final film he was struck by the underwater shots, especially the strange image of a man’s head under water. He reused that image in his later film \"L'Atalante\"."

        "title": "New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union",
        "text": "The New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union, or NSWSRU, is affiliated to the New South Wales Rugby Union and runs the competition affectionately known as \"Subbies\" rugby. There are around 7,500 players and 55 clubs competing across 6 divisions, making \"Subbies\" the largest centrally administered rugby competition in the world. NSWSRU is truly the grassroots of rugby in Sydney.\nThe major trophy in \"Subbies\" is the Kentwell Cup that is awarded to the first grade premiers of the first division competition. The NSWSRU selects representative sides to compete against New South Wales Country for the Maher-Ross Cup, and Queensland Suburban for the Barraclough Shield.\nHistory.\nFootball under rugby rules began to be played in the 1860s in Sydney's schools. Some of these former students wanted to go on playing and, along with an increasing population of new arrivals in Sydney, this led to the start of club football. After 1872, rugby football clubs grew rapidly in number.\nThe first 'Junior' clubs: 1872 to 1900.\nSydney rugby in the early years was played by Senior teams and Junior teams (where Junior denoted the second tier, not the age of the players). The Senior competition was run by the Southern Rugby Union (SRU, later to become the NSWRU) and had been in existence from 1874, but matches for Junior sides were arranged on an \"ad hoc\" basis until after the 1885 season. The SRU only began to involve itself in rugby for Junior teams in 1882, and only established a formal Junior competition in 1886.\nSome of the clubs in the original Junior competition were Petersham (who still exist in the Suburban competition today), Manly Federals, the Warrigals and Wentworth. Most of these clubs fielded one team and the competition received coverage in Sydney's newspapers under \"Other matches\". By 1896, in an early sign of what later led to the schism with rugby league, tensions emerged with suggestions that Senior clubs were trying to poach players with talent at Junior clubs using ‘incentives’ and that Junior players were being paid a match fee.\nA new branch of the NSWRU called the Metropolitan Rugby Union (MRU) was formed in 1897 to administer the Sydney competitions and re-organise the clubs along district lines. The previous Junior clubs and players were essentially merged into new district clubs. More than twenty Junior clubs, including foundation members of the union, vanished from the books in 1898.\nCity and Suburban Association formed in 1901.\nMost clubs that were disenfranchised in the move to district football between 1897 and 1900 simply went out of existence but a few, such as Petersham, continued playing matches between themselves beyond the control of the MRU and NSWRU. In 1901 the competition was formally organised under the City and Suburban Association, making it the earliest forerunner of today's Subbies rugby.\nTo counter this new rebel association, the MRU created its own Borough competition in 1902. Several of the leading City and Suburban clubs switched to this competition but, with the start of rugby league in 1908, it did not continue. With the advent of the Great War in 1914, most rugby union clubs ceased playing altogether and rugby league had won ascendancy in New South Wales.\nPost-war reformation in 1919.\nAfter the war was ended, the NSWRU established one competition for the 1919 season with divisions for both non-district and district clubs. The Mosman Rugby Club, as the winner of the Reserve Grade B division (effectively the first grade for non-district clubs), was presented with a cup donated by W.H. Kentwell in 1923. This began the long history of the Kentwell Cup which is now awarded to the NSWSRU first grade premiers in first division. The Burke Cup, was first presented to the Mosman club's second grade winning side in 1924 by James A. Burke, and is now contested by NSWSRU second grade teams in first division.\nSub-Districts Rugby Union.\nThe NSWRU formed a separate non-district club competition in 1929, which became the Metropolitan Sub-Districts Rugby Union in 1933. The Whiddon Cup was inaugurated in 1933 by Horace Whiddon of the Briars Club, and is now awarded to the NSWSRU third grade premiers.\nAt the start of the war in 1939 the NSWRU decided to cancel representative games but continue with club competitions. This was an attempt to ward off a repeat of the setback caused by the cessation of rugby during the previous war. All sports were ravaged during the war. Players and officials died or were injured during battle or as prisoners of war but, as at least a restricted form of the game was continued, rugby union was able to be successfully revived in 1946.\nAfter the war, Subbies rugby grew strongly. In 1966 Petersham made history as being the first club to circle the world on a rugby tour. The Sydney Sub-Districts Rugby Union was established in 1971, and the Subbies competition was rearranged into three divisions.\nNew South Wales Suburban Rugby Union.\nIn 1990, the Subbies became known as the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union. The second division of the Sydney district competition was absorbed into Subbies in 1993 and 18 clubs contested the Kentwell Cup in that year. Drummoyne, Mosman, University of NSW and Hornsby, Hawkesbury Agricultural College, Canterbury, Dundas Valley, Hawkesbury Valley are former district clubs that moved to Subbies.\nMost current clubs are based on a local community, links with schools, or voluntary groups. Old Ignatians, St Patricks, Barker Old Boys, Knox Rugby Club, Waverley, Kings Old Boys, and Oakhill are or were formed from ex-students of schools. The Bronte and Manly Savers clubs are composed of members of surf lifesaving clubs.\nPromotion and relegation is based on club championship results down to third division.\nRecent events.\nThere have been problems in recent years fielding a 4th Division competition (clubs with 3 grade teams). 4th Division was disbanded after the 2008 season, where only six clubs participated, and was further weakened with the withdrawal of two of the 3rd grade teams. The 4th Division was resurrected in 2011, again with six clubs, but again was afflicted with the withdrawal of two 3rd grade teams, although a Halligan Cup team – Colleagues Convicts – stepped up into the grade. In 2012 the season was played without a 4th division competition again.\nThe 4th Division competition was revived in 2014, but with it came the demise of the 5th Division (clubs with 2 teams). This means that clubs who were hoping to have 2 teams this year must either downsize to one team (Division 6) or hope for a 3rd grade team and push for the revived Division 4, making clubs either make players miss out on playing if unable to find a Halligan Cup fixture (lack of a 2nd grade) or trying to create a 3rd grade (possibly making players play 2 or more games of rugby).\nTrophies.\nCross Divisional\nCowboy Cup is competed by every team in Suburban Rugby. Each team, including Halligan Cup and Radford Cup competitions which are not included within divisional club championship competitions, earns points for the club. The winner of the Cowboy Cup is the club across all divisions who earn the most points throughout the season.\nFirst Division\nSecond Division\nThird Division\nFourth Division\nFifth Division – \"reinstated 2017 after a four season absence\" \nSixth Division – \"not contested in 2023\"\nAdditional Cups\nClubs.\nFor the 2023 season, clubs compete in the following divisions:\nNotes:\nRepresentative team.\nA representative NSW Suburban team is selected from players within the competition to play against other amateur representative sides. The Maher-Ross Cup is contested by NSW Suburban and NSW Country, and the Barraclough Shield is awarded to the winner of the interstate match between the NSW Suburban and Queensland Suburban teams. The Barraclough Shield was contested annually from 1966, until 2016."

It was founded by Kerry Yo Nakagawa, the author of \"Through a Diamond: 100 Years of Japanese American Baseball\". The NBRP's mission is to bring awareness and education about Japanese American Concentration Camps during World War II, through the prism of their multimedia projects and baseball. Also to recognize the many prewar Issei and Nisei ballplayers that never got an opportunity to play in Major League Baseball because of the 'color line' and their contribution as our American Baseball Ambassadors in the early 1920s and 1930s in Japan, Korea and Manchukuo, China. These ballplayers also kept the All-American Pastime alive during their incarceration during World War II as they played 'behind barbed wire' and again were denied of professional MLB careers.\nThe project began on May 4, 1996, at the Fresno Museum as the first exhibit to display the photos, memorabilia, artifacts, and text history of the \"Nikkei\" in baseball. The exhibit covers the pre-war, Japanese Internment, and post-war periods and the legacy of the legends of Japanese American baseball. On July 19, the National Japanese American Historical Society co-sponsored the exhibit to venues in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. On July 20, a Tribute to the Legends of the Nisei Baseball League was held before 50,000 fans at Candlestick Park. CNN News, Japan Baseball Weekly, the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Jose Mercury News, National Public Radio, and KNBR all covered this event.\nThe exhibit has been featured at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York, the California State Capitol Museum, the Arizona Hall of Fame Museum, the Portland Hall of Fame Museum in Oregon, the Four Rivers Cultural Center &amp; Museum in Los Angeles, the San Diego Hall of Champions Sports Museum, and the Fresno Metropolitan Museum. Internationally, the exhibit was on display at the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in Tokyo.\nIn 2000, the Nisei Baseball Research Project produced a 35-minute documentary film, entitled \"Diamonds in the Rough: The Legacy of Japanese American Baseball\", which was produced by Chip Taylor and narrated by Pat Morita.\nNBRP has co-produced two curriculums through the Stanford Program of International and Cross Cultural Education and produced the dramatic narrative film \"American Pastime\" released by Warner Bros. in 2007."

        "text": "Seven applicant cities presented bids to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics (formally known as \"XXII Olympic Winter Games\" and \"XI Paralympic Winter Games\") to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC Executive Board shortlisted three cities—Sochi, Russia; Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea—with Sochi winning the IOC's July 2007 final vote.\nThe three selected candidates, which were chosen on 22 June 2006, delivered to the IOC their Candidature Files (known as \"bid books\") on 10 January 2007. From February to April 2007, an \"ad hoc\" committee performed visits to the candidate cities and prepared an evaluation report which was released one month before the election.\nThe election by exhaustive ballot took place on 4 July 2007 in Guatemala City during the 119th IOC Session; Sochi beat out Pyeongchang by four votes in the second round of voting to win the rights to host after Salzburg had been eliminated in the first round. Pyeongchang could later awarded the 2018 Winter Olympics in 2011, just one year before the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nCandidature procedure and timeline.\nPhase 1: Candidature acceptance procedure.\nBidding cities had to be approved by their national Olympic committees, which have the right to choose between several cities in their respective countries. The cities had to submit their applications to the IOC by 28 July 2005. The cities were asked to complete a questionnaire, which they had to submit to the IOC by 1 February 2006. An IOC Working Group then studied their answers to help the executive board members select the cities, which became candidate cities and went through to the second phase of the process. The executive board of IOC accepted three bids on 22 June 2006.\nPhase 2: Candidature procedure.\nThe candidate cities were invited to submit their candidature file, which is a detailed description of their Olympic plans, and to prepare for a visit by the IOC Evaluation Commission. This commission undertook a technical analysis of each candidature and produced a report, which was to be published one month before the host-city election and sent to the IOC members for study. The candidature files were submitted on 10 January 2007. The IOC Evaluation Committee visited the candidate cities in February and March 2007, and published its report on 4 June.\nDuring the 119th IOC Session on 4 July 2007 in Guatemala City, Salzburg received 25 votes and was relegated, Pyeongchang received 36 votes, and Sochi received 34 votes in the first round of the IOC voting procedure. In the second and final round, Pyeongchang received 47 votes but Sochi received 51 votes and was therefore chosen as the host of the 2014 Olympics.\nEvaluation of the applicant cities.\nEach cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.\nCandidate cities overview.\nAll three cities suggested hosting the Games between February 7–23, 2014. The Paralympics were held from March 7–16.\nPyeongchang.\nPyeongchang was unanimously selected over Muju by the Korean Olympic Committee in December 2004, and was the first city to submit its bid to the International Olympic Committee. The bid launched a full-scale campaign after losing the 2010 race by a mere three votes to Vancouver. The 2014 project concentrated all venues within one hour of Pyeongchang, and called for huge sums of investment into new infrastructure and sporting venues, including the new Alpensia Resort. The sporting event was touted as promoting a message of peace and harmony in the divided country.\nSince 2003, the region had been selected to host the 2009 Snowboard World Championships, the 2009 Biathlon World Championships and the 2009 World Women's Curling Championship, and aimed to become the winter sports hub of Asia. Although an IOC evaluation team complimented the area on levels of public support, government support and infrastructure in February 2007, the bid was also criticized because Pyeongchang was not a popular tourist destination, the venue relied heavily on artificial snow due to a dry winter climate, most slopes were relatively short and local amenities were poorly developed. Pyeongchang was eventually chosen to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics.\nSalzburg.\nThe Austrian city was eliminated in the first round in voting during the 2010 competition. The 2014 bid was more compact than the 2010 project due to the elimination of the Kitzbühel, St. Johann and Ramsau venues. The venue for bobsled, skeleton and luge, Schönau am Königssee, was located in Germany.\nSochi.\nThe Russian Black Sea resort bid for the Winter Olympics for the second time after failing to make the shortlist in 2002. The primary venue for outdoor sports was the ski resort in Krasnaya Polyana, which was designed by the same company that worked on ski slopes for the 2010 Winter Olympics, and scheduled to open in 2007. Sochi would host the indoor winter sports. The high number of hotel rooms and strong public and political support from the city were expected to strengthen the bid's chances.\n\"Note: the cities are listed in the presentation order determined by draw during the IOC Executive Board meeting of 26 October 2005.\"\nApplicant cities overview.\nThe following applicant cities were approved by their National Olympic Committees and submitted their applications to the IOC but were not selected as candidates by the executive board. They all sent their respective questionnaire answers by 1 February 2006. These documents were made public in the following days.\n\"Note: the cities are listed in the presentation order determined by draw during the IOC Executive Board meeting of 26 October 2005.\"\nApplicant cities comparison.\n\"*Airports not included\"\n\"Note: the cities are listed in the presentation order defined by the IOC during its Executive Board of 26 October 2005.\"\nApplicant cities venues list.\nThese venues are from the applicant cities' mini bid books. Note that the selected candidate cities, and in particular Sochi, changed their venues plan afterwards in the final proposal to the IOC.\nPotential bids.\nThe following cities expressed interest in bidding but withdrew their 2014 Winter Olympics bids or decided not to bid.\nVotes results of the 2014 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics.\nFour years earlier, Pyeongchang led the first ballot but was defeated in the second one, then losing to Vancouver, British Columbia. Both votes although four years apart bore a remarkable similarity.\nThere were two rounds of voting at the session that decided which city would host the games. In the first round, Pyeongchang received 36 votes while Sochi received 34 votes. Salzburg was eliminated with only 25 votes. In the second round of voting, Pyeongchang garnered 47 votes but Sochi received most of the votes originally cast for Salzburg and gained 51 votes, winning the bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics."

        "title": "History of golf",
        "text": "The origins of golf are unclear and much debated. However, it is generally accepted that modern golf developed in Scotland from the Middle Ages onwards. The game did not find international popularity until the late 19th century, when it spread into the rest of the United Kingdom and then to the British Empire and the United States.\nOrigins.\nNetherlandish precursors.\nA golf-like game is apocryphally, recorded as taking place on February 26, 1297, in Loenen aan de Vecht, where the Dutch played a game with a stick and leather ball. The winner was whoever hit the ball with the fewest strokes into a target several hundred yards away. Some scholars argue that this game of putting a small ball in a hole in the ground using \"golf clubs\" was also played in 17th-century Netherlands and that this predates the game in Scotland.\nThere are also other reports of earlier accounts of a golf-like game from continental Europe.\nIn the 1261 Middle Dutch manuscript of the Flemish poet Jacob van Maerlant's \"Boeck Merlijn\" mention is made of a ball game \"mit ener coluen\" (with a colf/kolf [club]). This is the earliest known mention in the Dutch language of the game of colf/kolf as played in the Low Countries.\nIn 1360, the council of Brussels banned the game of colf: \"wie metlven tsolt es om twintich scell' oft op hare overste cleet\" (he who plays at colf pays a fine of 20 shillings or his overcoat will be confiscated).\nIn 1387, the regent of the county of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut, Albrecht of Bavaria, sealed a charter for the city of Brielle, in which it was forbidden to play any game for money. One of the exceptions to this ordinance was \"den bal mitter colven te slaen buten der veste\" (to play the ball with a club outside the town walls). Two years later, in 1389, the regent Albrecht offered the citizens of Haarlem a field called \"De Baen\" (the course) to be used exclusively for playing games – especially colf – because these were too dangerous within the city walls.\nA game similar to modern day golf features in a book of hours from 1540, which has, based on this association, acquired the name of the Golf Book. It was illustrated by a Flemish artist called Simon Bening.\nIn 1571, the book, \"Biblia dat is, de gantsche Heylighe Schrift, grondelic ende trouwclick verduydtschet\", describes the game of \"Kolf\" played with a \"bat\" and \"sach\". \nIn 1597, the crew of Willem Barentsz played \"colf\" during their stay at Nova Zembla, as recorded by Gerrit de Veer in his diary:\nIn December 1650, the settlers of Fort Orange (near present-day Albany, New York) played the first recorded round of \"kolf\" (golf) in America. The Dutch settlers played kolf year round. During the spring, summer and fall it was played in fields. In the winter it was played on ice with the same rules. Then on December 10, 1659, the ruler passed an ordinance against playing golf in the streets of the same city.\nEarly golf in Scotland.\nThe modern game of golf is generally considered to be a Scottish invention. A spokesman for The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, one of the oldest Scottish golf organisations, said \"Stick and ball games have been around for many centuries, but golf as we know it today, played over 18 holes, clearly originated in Scotland.\" The word \"golf\", or in Scots \"gowf\" [gʌuf], is usually thought to be a Scots alteration of Dutch \"\"colf\" or \"colve\" meaning \"stick\", \"\"club\", \"bat\"\", itself related to the Proto-Germanic language \"*kulth-\" as found in Old Norse \"kolfr\" meaning \"bell clapper\", and the German \"Kolben\" meaning \"mace or club\". The Dutch term \"Kolven\" refers to a related sport where the lowest number of strokes needed to hit a ball with a mallet into a hole determines the winner; according to the \"Le grand dictionnaire françois-flamen\" printed 1643 is stated the Dutch term to Flemish: \"Kolf, zest Kolve; Kolfdrager, Sergeant; Kolf, Kolp, Goulfe.\"\nThe first documented mention of golf in Scotland appears in a 1457 Act of the Scottish Parliament, an edict issued by King James II of Scotland prohibiting the playing of the games of \"gowf\" and \"futball\" as these were a distraction from archery practice for military purposes. Bans were again imposed in Acts of 1471 and 1491, with golf being described as \"an unprofitable sport\". Golf was banned again by parliament under King James IV of Scotland, but golf clubs and balls were bought for him in 1502 when he was visiting Perth, and on subsequent occasions when he was in St Andrews and Edinburgh.\nMary, Queen of Scots played, and she was accused of playing \"pell-mell and golf\" at Seton Palace after her husband Lord Darnley was murdered in 1567, when she ought to have been in solemn mourning. George Buchanan wrote that she had been following her \"usual amusements in the adjoining fields that were plainly not adapted to women\".\nAn entry in the Town Council Minutes of Edinburgh for 19 April 1592 includes golf in a list of pursuits to be avoided on the Sabbath. On 13 February 1593 the Duke of Lennox and Sir James Sandilands decided to go down to Leith to play golf. On the way they met members of the Graham family who were feuding with Sandilands, and fought with pistols instead.\nThe account book of lawyer Sir John Foulis of Ravelston records that he played golf at Musselburgh Links on 2 March 1672, and this has been accepted as proving that The Old Links, Musselburgh, is the oldest playing golf course in the world. There is also a story that Mary, Queen of Scots played there in 1567.\nJames VII of Scotland, while still Duke of Albany, was said to have played the first international golf contest in 1681 when he participated in a game against two English courtiers as part of a bet over rights to claim the game for Scotland or England. His teammate was said to be one John Paterson, who received as payment, enough money to build a mansion on the area of Edinburgh now known as Golfers Land.\nInstructions, golf club rules and competitions.\nThe earliest known instructions for playing golf have been found in the diary of Thomas Kincaid, a medical student who played on the course at Bruntsfield Links, near Edinburgh University, and at Leith Links. His notes include his views on an early handicap system. In his entry for 20 January 1687 he noted how \"After dinner I went out to the Golve\", and described his Golf stroke: \nThe oldest surviving rules of golf were written in 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which played at Leith Links. Their \"\"Articles and Laws in Playing at Golf\", now preserved in the National Library of Scotland, became known as the \"Leith Rules\" and the document supports the club's claim to be the oldest golf club, though an almanac published about a century later is the first record of a rival claim that The Royal Burgess Golfing Society had been set up in 1735. The instructions in the \"Leith Rules\" formed the basis for all subsequent codes, for example requiring that \"Your Tee must be upon the ground\" and \"You are not to change the Ball which you strike off the Tee\".\nThe 1744 competition for the Gentlemen Golfers' Competition for the Silver Club, a trophy in the form of a silver golf club provided as sponsorship by Edinburgh Town Council, was won by surgeon John Rattray, who was required to attach to the trophy a silver ball engraved with his name, beginning a long tradition. Rattray joined the Jacobite Rising of 1745 and as a result was imprisoned in Inverness, but was saved from being hanged by the pleading of his fellow golfer Duncan Forbes of Culloden, Lord President of the Court of Session. Rattray was released in 1747, and won the Silver Club three times in total.\nSpread.\nEarly excursions.\nIn 1603, James VI of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England. His son, the Prince of Wales and his courtiers played golf at Blackheath, London, from which the Royal Blackheath Golf Club traces its origins. There is evidence that Scottish soldiers, expatriates and immigrants took the game to British colonies and elsewhere during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In the early 1770s, the first golf course in Africa was built on Bunce Island in Sierra Leone by British slave traders. The Royal Calcutta Golf Club (1829), the Mauritius Gymkhana Club (1844) and the club at Pau (1856) in south western France are notable reminders of these excursions and are the oldest golf clubs outside of the British Isles. The Pau Golf Club is the oldest in continental Europe. However, it was not until the late 19th century that Golf became more widely popular outside of its Scottish home.\nThe late 19th-century boom.\nIn the 1850s, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert built Balmoral Castle in the Scottish Highlands.\nThe railways came to St Andrews in 1852. By the 1860s, there were fast and regular services from London to Edinburgh. The royal enthusiasm for Scotland, the much improved transport links and the writings of Sir Walter Scott caused a boom for tourism in Scotland and a wider interest in Scottish history and culture outside of the country. This period also coincided with the development of the \"Gutty\"; a golf ball made of Gutta Percha which was cheaper to mass-produce, more durable and more consistent in quality and performance than the feather-filled leather balls used previously. Golf began to spread across the rest of the British Isles. In 1864, the golf course at the resort of Westward Ho! became the first new club in England since Blackheath, and the following year London Scottish Golf Club was founded on Wimbledon Common. In 1880 England had 12 courses, rising to 50 in 1887 and over 1000 by 1914. The game in England had progressed sufficiently by 1890 to produce its first English-born Open Champion, John Ball. The game also spread further across the empire. By the 1880s, golf clubs had been established in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. Singapore followed in 1891. Courses were also established in several continental European resorts for the benefit of British visitors.\nUnited States.\n17th-century America: In December 1650, near Fort Orange (modern city of Albany, New York), a group of four men were playing Kolf in pairs for points. On July 22, 1657, several men were cited and warned not to play Kolf on Sundays. On December 10, 1659, an ordinance was issued to prevent playing Kolf in the streets of Albany due to too many windows being broken.\nEvidence of early golf in what is now the United States includes a 1739 record for a shipment of golf equipment to a William Wallace in Charleston, South Carolina, an advertisement published in the \"Royal Gazette\" of New York City in 1779 for golf clubs and balls, and the establishment of the South Carolina Golf Club in 1787 in Charleston. However, as in England, it was not until the late 19th century that golf started to become firmly established.\nSeveral clubs established in the 1880s can make claim to be the oldest extant in the country, but what is not disputed is that as a result of two competing \"National Amateur Championships\" being played in 1894, delegates from the Newport Country Club, Bob Bobbin's Golf Club, Yonkers, New York, The Country Club, Chicago Golf Club, and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club met in New York City what was to become the United States Golf Association (USGA). By 1910 there were 267 clubs.\nDuring the Roaring Twenties the game expanded greatly in popularity and by 1932 there were over 1,100 golf clubs affiliated to the USGA. In 1922, Walter Hagen became the first native born American to win the British Open Championship. The expansion of the game was halted by the Great Depression and World War II, but continued in the post war years. By 1980 there were over 5,908 USGA affiliated clubs. That figure grew to over 10,600 by 2013. Starting in the 1920s, and growing through the 1990s, many residential golf course communities have been built.\nJapan.\nAfter the Meiji restoration of 1868 Japan made a concerted effort to modernise its economy and industry on western lines. Japanese came to Europe and America to establish trade links and study and acquire the latest developments in business, science and technology, and westerners came to Japan to help establish schools, factories, shipyards and banks.\nIn 1903 a group of British expatriates established the first golf club in Japan, at Kobe. In 1913 the Tokyo Golf club at Komazawa was established for and by native Japanese who had encountered golf in the United States, but it was moved to Asaka in Saitama prefecture in 1932. In 1921, Japan established the first golf course in Korea at Hyochang Park, which then contained the tombs of Korean royalty. The game was played around the tombs. In 1924 the Japan Golf Association was established by the seven clubs then in existence. During the 1920s and early 1930s several new courses were built, however the Great Depression and increasing anti-Western sentiment limited the growth of the game. By the time of the Japanese attacks against the USA and British Empire in 1941 there were 23 courses. During the subsequent war most of the courses were requisitioned for military use or returned to agricultural production.\nIn the postwar period, Japan's golf courses came under the control of the occupying forces. It was not until 1952 that courses started to be returned to Japanese control. By 1956 there were 72 courses and in 1957 Torakichi Nakamura and Koichi Ono won the Canada Cup (now World Cup) in Japan, an event that is often cited as igniting the post-war golf boom. Between 1960 and 1964 the number of golf courses in Japan increased from 195 to 424. By the early 1970s there were over 1,000 courses. The 1987 \"Resort Law\" that reduced protection on agricultural land and forest preserves created a further boom in course construction and by 2009 there were over 2,400 courses. The popularity of golf in Japan also caused many golf resorts to be created across the Pacific Rim. The environmental effect of these recent golf booms is seen as a cause for concern by many.\nTibet.\nHugh Edward Richardson introduced golf to Tibet, although he noted that the ball \"tended to travel 'rather too far in the thin air'.\"\nGolf course evolution.\nGolf courses have not always had eighteen holes. The St Andrews Links occupy a narrow strip of land along the sea. As early as the 15th century, golfers at St Andrews established a trench through the undulating terrain, playing to holes whose locations were dictated by topography. The course that emerged featured eleven holes, laid out end to end from the clubhouse to the far end of the property. One played the holes out, turned around, and played the holes in, for a total of 22 holes. In 1764, several of the holes were deemed too short, and were therefore combined. The number of holes was thereby reduced from 11 to 9, so that a complete round of the links comprised 18 holes. Due to the status of St Andrews as the golfing capital, all other courses followed suit and the 18-hole course remains the standard to the present day.\nEquipment development.\nThe evolution of golf can be explained by the development of the equipment used to play the game. Some of the most notable advancements in the game of golf have come from the development of the golf ball. The golf ball took on many different forms before the 1930s when the United States Golf Association (USGA) set standards for weight and size. These standards were later followed by a USGA regulation stating that the initial velocity of any golf ball cannot exceed . Since this time, the golf ball has continued to develop and impact the way the game is played.\nAnother notable factor in the evolution of golf has been the development of golf clubs. The earliest golf clubs were made of wood that was readily available in the area. Over the years, hickory developed into the standard wood used for shafts and American persimmon became the choice of wood for the club head due to its hardness and strength. As the golf ball developed and became more durable with the introduction of the \"gutty\" around 1850, the club head was also allowed to develop, and a variety of iron headed clubs entered the game. The introduction of steel shafts began in the late 1890s, but their adoption by the governing bodies of golf was slow. In the early 1970s, shaft technology shifted again with the use of graphite for its lightweight and strength characteristics. The first metal \"wood\" was developed in the early 1980s, and metal eventually completely replaced wood due to its strength and versatility. The latest golf club technology employs the use of graphite shafts and lightweight titanium heads, which allows the club head to be made much larger than previously possible. The strength of these modern materials also allows the face of the club to be much thinner, which increases the spring-like effect of the club face on the ball, theoretically increasing the distance the ball travels. In 2003 the USGA and R&amp;A began limiting the spring-like effect, also known as the coefficient of restitution (COR) to 0.83 and the maximum club head size to in an attempt to maintain the challenge of the game.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"golf\" was first mentioned in writing in 1457 on a Scottish statute on forbidden games as \"gouf\", possibly derived from the Scots word \"goulf\" (variously spelled) meaning \"to strike or cuff\". This word may, in turn, be derived from the Dutch word \"kolf\", meaning \"bat\" or \"club\", and the Dutch sport of the same name.\nThe Dutch term \"Kolf\" and the Flemish term Kolven refers to a related sport where the lowest number of strokes needed to hit a ball with a mallet into a hole determines the winner; according to the \"Le grand dictionnaire ftançois-flamen printed 1643 is stated the Dutch term to Flemish: \"Kolf, zest Kolve; Kolfdrager, Sergeant; Kolf, Kolp, Goulfe.\"\nThere is a persistent urban legend claiming that the term derives from an acronym \"Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden\". This is a false etymology, as acronyms being used as words is a fairly modern phenomenon, making the expression a backronym.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, a professional philologist, nodded to the derivation from the Dutch word for club in his 1937 fantasy novel \"The Hobbit\". There he mentions (tongue-in-cheek) that the game of golf was invented when a club-wielding hobbit knocked the head off a goblin named Golfimbul, and the head sailed through the air and landed in a rabbit hole.\nMuseums.\nThe history of golf is preserved and represented at several golf museums around the world, notably the R&amp;A World Golf Museum in the town of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, which is the home of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, and the United States Golf Association Museum, located alongside the United States Golf Association headquarters in Far Hills, New Jersey.\nThe World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida, also presents a history of the sport, as does the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in Oakville, Ontario, and the American Golf Hall of Fame in Foxburg, Pennsylvania, at the Foxburg Country Club.\nMuseums for individual players include the Jack Nicklaus Museum in Columbus, Ohio, and rooms in the USGA Museum for Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer, and Ben Hogan."

        "text": "Christopher Kelly (born November 11, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and current assistant coach for the Boston Bruins. Kelly played for the Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins and Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was a member of the Bruins' 2011 Stanley Cup-winning team.\nHe won gold with Team Canada at the 2017 Spengler Cup. In the 2018 Winter Olympics, Kelly represented Canada as captain of the men's ice hockey team, leading the team to a bronze medal.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nKelly was born in Toronto and grew up one hour east of the city in Bowmanville. He started playing in the Bowmanville Recreational Hockey League and with the Bowmanville Toros AA program. He played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Marlboros minor ice hockey team. For one year, he played for the OHA Jr. A. hockey with the Aurora Tigers. Kelly was then selected in the fourth round, 56th overall, by the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s London Knights in the 1997 OHL Priority Selection.\nAt the major junior level, Kelly played for both the Knights and the Sudbury Wolves. In 1998–99, he scored 36 goals, his career-high scoring mark in the OHL. He also played for the Team Orr in the mid-season at the CHL Top Prospects Game. In the OHL playoffs, he scored nine goals and 26 points in 25 games as the Knights reached the OHL Final.\nProfessional.\nOttawa Senators.\nKelly was drafted 94th overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. He spent one year in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Grand Rapids Griffins and three seasons in the same league with the Binghamton Senators. He also played with the Muskegon Fury (of the UHL) for four games (recovering from an injury). In 2004–05, he had finished fifth in the AHL in plus-minus with +30. He also finished fifth on Binghamton with 60 points, as the team finished fourth overall in the League. When he was a professional rookie in 2001–02, he helped the Griffins finish fourth in the AHL. In his two final seasons in Binghamton, Kelly served as team captain.\nKelly made his NHL debut on February 5, 2004, in a match against the Toronto Maple Leafs, one of four games he appeared in with Ottawa during 2003–04. In his rookie season of 2005–06, he became a regular in Ottawa's line-up, appearing in all of the team's 82 games and registering 30 points whilst playing in a checking role. The following season, he was a member of the Senators team that advanced to the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.\nOn July 31, 2007, he re-signed with the Senators to a one-year contract worth $1.263 million. Kelly was set to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2008, but again re-signed with the Senators on a four-year contract extension worth $8.5 million on June 20, 2008.\nBoston Bruins.\nAs part of a rebuilding process undertaken by the Senators as the 2010–11 season was concluding, Kelly was traded to the Boston Bruins on February 15, 2011, for a second-round draft pick in 2011; Ottawa later used the pick to select forward Shane Prince. Kelly and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Vancouver Canucks.\nOn April 12, 2012, Kelly scored the game-winning goal in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series against the Washington Capitals; the Bruins ultimately lost the series in seven games.\nA pending unrestricted free agent as the 2011–12 season wrapped up, Kelly was rumoured to be returning to the Senators, though he ended up re-signing with the Bruins on June 11, 2012, agreeing to a four-year, $12 million contract. The deal, however, was quickly rejected by the NHL due to what then-Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli referred to as \"payroll tagging issues.\" Kelly stayed with the Bruins, and played in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals.\nAs the 2013–14 season began on October 3, 2013, with a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, Kelly had his first-ever chance at a penalty shot in his NHL career in the first period of the game; he converted the penalty shot, scoring the first Bruins goal of the season against goaltender Anders Lindbäck while the Bruins were in a short-handed situation en route to an eventual 3–1 home victory. The goal marked the first time in NHL history that a team scored its first goal of the season via a penalty shot.\nIn his sixth year with the Bruins in the 2015–16 season, and in the final year of his contract, Kelly began the campaign leading the Bruins penalty-kill. Kelly scored 2 goals in 11 games before on November 3, 2015, he buckled his left leg on the ice and broke his left femur in a game against the Dallas Stars. He was announced to have undergone surgery the following day and was scheduled to have a 6-8 month recovery period, which effectively ruled him out for the season.\nReturn to Ottawa.\nAs a free agent following his recovery from his broken leg with the Bruins, Kelly signed a one-year contract to return to the Ottawa Senators on July 7, 2016. In the 2016–17 season, Kelly appeared in all 82 games for the club, scoring 12 points.\nLater career and Anaheim Ducks.\nAt the conclusion of his contract, Kelly was not re-signed by the Senators, making him an unrestricted free agent. Unsigned over the summer, the Edmonton Oilers signed Kelly to a professional tryout on September 9, 2017. Kelly attended the Oilers training camp and pre-season and remained with the club to start the 2017–18 season. Despite practicing with the team, Kelly was not offered a contract with the Oilers, and on November 24, 2017, he returned within the Senators organization by signing a professional tryout deal with new AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators.\nOn January 9, 2018, following his performance with Team Canada at the Spengler Cup, Kelly was re-signed to a professional tryout agreement with the Belleville Senators.\nAt the conclusion of the Olympics, Kelly returned to the NHL in agreeing to a one-year, $1.25 million contract for the remainder of the season with the Anaheim Ducks on February 25, 2018. He appeared in just 12 games to play out the regular season, posting two assists.\nCoaching career.\nOn September 4, 2018, Kelly was hired by the Senators as a development coach, effectively ending his playing career. Kelly joined former Senators' teammate Shean Donovan in overseeing and supporting the development of prospects throughout the Ottawa system.\nOn August 13, 2021, Kelly was hired as an assistant coach by the Boston Bruins.\nInternational play.\nSpengler Cup.\nOn December 20, 2017, Kelly was released from his professional tryout agreement with the Belleville Senators to join Team Canada for the 2017 Spengler Cup, which they won. He rejoined the Senators immediately following the tournament.\nOlympics.\nOn January 11, 2018, Kelly was named to Team Canada for the 2018 Winter Olympics. He was named team captain on February 8, 2018. Kelly and Team Canada won the bronze medal, defeating the Czech Republic 6–4.\nPersonal life.\nKelly married during the summer of 2008 in Mexico. He met his wife Krissy Broderick while attending Saunders Secondary School as a member of the London Knights as a teenager. Broderick now teaches elementary school in Ottawa."

The other cities shortlisted by the IOC Selection Committee chaired by Thomas Bach were Sion, Switzerland; Östersund, Sweden; and Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The host city selection procedure to for the 2002 Winter Olympics faced a scandal regarding the interactions between the Salt Lake City bid team and International Olympic Committee (IOC) members; ten IOC members resigned as a result, as did Salt Lake City bid leaders Tom Welch and Dave Johnson. Nevertheless, Salt Lake City overwhelmingly won the right to host the Games, needing only one round to gain the absolute majority of the votes.\nNevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, this was one of the most successful Winter Olympic Games in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours. The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues."

While with the Maple Leafs he won the Stanley Cup five times. Born in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, he was the brother of Leafs teammate Nick Metz.\nPlaying career.\nMetz was an integral part of the Leafs' come from behind victory in the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. In game five, he scored three goals and two assists to lead the Leafs to a 9–3 victory. He also scored the game-winning goal in game six. What made Metz' accomplishment more successful is that he was not put in the lineup until the Leafs were down 3–0; the Leafs won all four games in which he was dressed. Metz finished the series with four goals and three assists.\nThe rest of his years were split between the Leafs and the AHL's Pittsburgh Hornets. He ended up playing 172 NHL games, scoring 20 goals and 35 assists for 55 points during the regular season."

It was her first major title, and she lost only one set during the tournament (to Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals). Kuznetsova became the third Russian woman, after Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova (who won the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, earlier in the season), to win a major that year and overall. This was also the second-ever all-Russian major final (the first being at the French Open earlier in the season, where Myskina defeated Dementieva).\nJustine Henin was the defending champion, but was defeated by Nadia Petrova in the fourth round. As a result, Amélie Mauresmo became the new world No. 1 following the tournament.\nThis marked the first US Open main draw appearance for 2011 champion Samantha Stosur, who was defeated by Petrova in the second round.\nThe quarterfinal match between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati is often considered the catalyst for the International Tennis Federation adoption of Hawk-Eye triangulation technology to review line calls. Hawk-Eye was unofficially used for television coverage for the match, with results suggesting that several crucial points awarded to Capriati were incorrectly called. The most egregious of these errors was a potential Williams winner at deuce in the first game of the final set that appeared to be well within the left baseline; while the line judge called the ball in, the chair umpire Mariana Alves overruled to award the point to Capriati. Capriati ultimately ended up winning the deuce, the set, and the match. Following outcry from spectators and the press, the United States Tennis Association suspended Alves for the remainder of the tournament and apologized to Williams. The ITF tested the Hawk-Eye system in an official capacity the next year, ultimately approving it for official use."

        "title": "Reno Silver Sox (Golden Baseball League)",
        "text": "The Reno Silver Sox were a professional baseball team based in Reno, Nevada, in the United States. They were a member of the North Division of the independent Golden Baseball League, which is not affiliated with either Major League Baseball \"or\" Minor League Baseball. From 2006 to 2008, they played their home games at William Peccole Park, on the campus of the University of Nevada, Reno.\nThe team was the descendant of the original Reno Silver Sox minor league baseball team that played with three leagues from 1947 to 1992.\nHistory of the Silver Sox name.\nFor obvious reasons, the name Silver Sox is derived from the nickname of Nevada, the \"Silver State\". Like MLB's Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox, the team has a sock as its logo.\nSunset League/Far West League (1948–1951).\nBefore they became a part of the GBL, the Silver Sox actually began their legacy as a member of the class-C Sunset League in 1947. They won the league championship in 1948. The team would be downgraded to the Class-D Far West League in 1950 and would play there until 1951 in an overall shoddily run league that would acquire the nickname the Far Worst League before it folded.\nCalifornia League (1955–1992).\nThe second incarnation were a member of the single-A California League starting in 1947 as the Ventura Yankees and remained so until 1949. They changed their names several times starting with the Ventura Braves in 1950-52, the Ventura Oilers in 1953, the Channel Cities Oilers in 1954-55, then moved to Reno during 1955 season becoming the Reno Oilers in 1955 and finally became the Reno Silver Sox during that 1955 season. The team won the CL Championship on four occasions before folding in the 1970s. They won the league championship in 1960, 1961, 1975 and 1976 and were listed #55 among MinorLeagueBaseball.com's 100 Best Minor League Baseball Teams. They were a class-C (equivalent to today's single-A) affiliate of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe third version was another California League team that was an affiliate of the San Diego Padres from 1977 to 1987, then was unaffiliated from 1988 to their final season in 1992. They joined the league as the \"new\" Silver Sox then changed their name to the Reno Padres in 1982, then back to the Silver Sox when they were dropped as Padres affiliate in 1988. The team made the playoffs on two occasions, losing the CL Championship series in 1987.\nGolden Baseball League franchise history.\nBeginning, Championship &amp; End.\nThe fourth, and current, Silver Sox franchise started as the Mesa Miners in 2005. They played their home games at HoHoKam Park in Mesa, Arizona. They were one of the original eight GBL charter teams along with the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in California; Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions in Arizona and the traveling Japan Samurai Bears that began play in May 2005.\nIn their only year of play in Mesa, the team won the first ever GBL Arizona Division title and played in the Championship Game against the Surf Dawgs. Unfortunately, the Miners had the league's worst overall attendance, and was dropped from the GBL in November 2005. The league also dropped Surprise largely due to not having another team in central Arizona and to give the league an even number of six teams instead of seven. The low attendance numbers both teams received were due largely to the fact that many of their home games were played in the scorching night-time heat of central Arizona.\nThe GBL has said publicly that they would reconsider the Arizona market (Mesa and Surprise) if the league, the city of Mesa and the concessionaire at HoHoKam Park could agree on a revenue sharing agreement for concessions sales. In 2005 the Miners received none of the sales proceeds from their own games. The Miners were the only team in the league without revenue sharing on concessions.\nMuch of the Miners' roster and coaching staff were carried over to the league's new Reno Silver Sox team in 2006. Playing at Peccole Park on the University of Nevada campus, the Silver Sox were instrumental in helping the college improve the facility and partnered in adding lights and an artificial all-weather turf field. While much better than the old and run-down Moana Field which housed the former professional Silver Sox, the University stadium still had much to be desired with its inadequate home locker rooms, no visitor locker rooms, and poorly thought out seating design that forced fans to go behind the bleachers to move through the ballpark The Silver Sox opened their inaugural campaign in Reno by winning the 2006 GBL Championship defeating the Fullerton Flyers 3-1 in the championship series. Les Lancaster was named the GBL Manager of the Year for the 2006 season., while the MVP of the team was catcher Marcus Jensen a former major leaguer and member of the 2000 U.S. Olympic Gold medal team. Solid attendance accompanied the championship team with sellout crowds on many occasions, including the series where Jose Canseco came in as a member of Long Beach Armada and appeared at one game and then faked a back injury to skip the next two games so he could stay up all night playing poker at the Grand Sierra Resort. The team sold an independent league record nine players to major league organizations during 2006 and still managed to reload and win the title.\nAfter a disappointing 2007 season when the Sox finished 9 games under .500, Lancester left the team and would be replaced by former San Francisco Giants star Jeffrey Leonard in 2008. They finished the season with an even more disappointing 30-58 record under Leonard. Midway through the season as it became apparent that the Triple-A Pacific Coast League would be re-locating to Reno, the Silver Sox had diminished fan and sponsor support and even saw some of the front office management start to lobby for and then moonlight with the AAA team.\nThe End of the Reno era.\nWith the pending arrival of the Pacific Coast League's Reno Aces, the Silver Sox were forced out and the search began for a new home ballpark and new owners. There were rumors about the team possibly moving south to Carson City, Nevada, but there was no suitable ballpark to host the team or any interested investors who would bring the team there, so as a result, the franchise was sold to Tucson Baseball LLC and renamed the Tucson Toros, who (like the original Reno Silver Sox) were named after a former minor league team. The identity and history of the GBL Silver Sox remain the property of the league for a future expansion franchise.\nArizona Winter League version.\nIn 2009, the Silver Sox name, uniforms and caps became used by the Arizona Winter League's newest team, the Saskatchewan Silver Sox, who play their home games at Desert Sun Stadium in Yuma, Arizona, the AWL's home base and home stadium of the Yuma Scorpions. Supported by throngs of Saskatchewan residents wintering in Arizona, the dedicated fans who attended the team's games did catch the attention of GBL commissioner Kevin Outcalt. He said, \"The Silver Sox are also a bit of a nod by the Golden League that we'd love to be up in Saskatchewan, too, in Saskatoon or in Regina or Moose Jaw, if we had the right ownership group and ballpark.\"\nThe Saskatchewan Silver Sox were immensely popular in Arizona and followed by the Saskatoon media and fans from Canada as well. The alliterative allure of the name and the fact that there are significant silver deposits on the Saskatchewan/Manitoba Flin Flon border beneath the Canadian Shield could result in another resurrection of this storied baseball team name in the near future as the GBL continues to expand across Canada."

They played out of Labatt Park.\nThe Monarchs' field manager was former Major League outfielder Willie Wilson. The team went through two general managers, the first being former pro umpire Kirk Sawyers. Shortly after the regular season began, Sawyers and several other prominent league employees, including ex-MLB star Ron LeFlore, resigned en masse.\nThe Monarchs hosted the inaugural CBL game. This was the league's only regular season sellout, as more than 5,000 people saw London defeat Montreal in the nationally televised game. The Monarchs averaged over 700 fans per game for the remainder of the shortened season."

He played college football at the University of Miami.\nEarly years.\nBailey attended Miami Southridge High School, where he lettered in football and track &amp; field.\nHe accepted a scholarship from the University of Miami. As a junior, he started one game and recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. He started every game in his last year, while tallying 75 tackles, one interception and 11 passes defensed.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nBailey was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the fourth round (107th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he started the season on the injured reserve list for the first 5 games with a broken bone in his right hand. The tip of Bailey's left ring finger was torn off while playing against the Detroit Lions and he was placed on injured reserve for the remaining games.\nIn his second season, he started 6 games at left cornerback, posting 3 interceptions. In 1993, he appeared in 9 games and tied for a team-high 2 interceptions before suffering a season-ending knee injury.\nOn October 23, 1994, Bailey made the longest punt return in NFL history when he ran 103 yards for a touchdown in a game against the New Orleans Saints. What makes this return stand out is that every single player on the field assumed the ball was going to bounce through the end zone after the punt. Bailey saw that the ball never bounced out of the end zone and was still in play. He scooped up the ball and returned it for a touchdown before anyone on the Saints realized what had happened. He was waived before the start of the 1995 season.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn September 12, 1995, he signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins to take the place of the injured Muhammad Oliver. He played in 4 games before being released on October 16, to make room for wide receiver Olanda Truitt.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn October 19, 1995, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys. He played mainly as a special teams player, until being named the nickel back after Clayton Holmes was suspended under the NFL substance abuse policy. He was a part of the Super Bowl XXX winning team.\nMiami Dolphins.\nOn March 7, 1996, the Miami Dolphins signed him as a free agent. He was a backup cornerback that appeared in 14 games and was declared inactive for 2 contests.\nDetroit Lions (first stint).\nOn April 25, 1997, he was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Lions. He registered 15 special teams tackles (fifth on the team).\nIn 1998, he played as a dime back, making 24 defensive tackles and 11 special teams tackles. The next year, he started 11 games at left cornerback and had 65 tackles, 2 interceptions, 24 passes defensed, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nFor the 2000 season, he signed with the Baltimore Ravens. He was the team's nickel back, recording 27 tackles, 4 passes defensed, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and 7 special teams tackles. He earned his second Super Bowl ring when the Ravens defeated the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV at the end of the season. On March 12, 2001, he was released in a salary cap move.\nDetroit Lions (second stint).\nOn May 17, 2001, he was signed by the Detroit Lions to be the team's dime back. He played in 9 games, before suffering a broken neck against the Green Bay Packers that ended his career.\nPersonal life.\nBailey works in the sports marketing business as President of Rosenhaus Sports.

        "text": "A skeleton suit was an outfit of clothing for small boys, popular from about 1790 to the late 1820s, after which it increasingly lost favor with the advent of trousers. It consisted of a tight short- or long-sleeved coat or jacket buttoned to a pair of high-waisted trousers. Skeleton suits are often described as one of the earliest fashions to be specifically tailored for children, rather than being adult fashions sized down. Previously (and subsequently) young boys wore dresses until they were breeched, or put into trousers.\nCharles Dickens describes a skeleton suit as \"one of those straight blue cloth cases in which small boys used to be confined, before belts and tunics had come in, and old notions had gone out: an ingenious contrivance for displaying the full symmetry of a boy's figure, by fastening him into a very tight jacket, with an ornamental row of buttons over each shoulder, and then buttoning his trousers over it, so as to give his legs the appearance of being hooked on, just under the armpits\" (\"Sketches by Boz\", 1836). Despite Dickens' assertions, skeleton suits were made in various colors. They were usually worn with a white blouse or shirt trimmed with lace or ruffles.\nSkeleton suits are one of the children's nostalgic Regency fashions typical of the illustrations of Kate Greenaway.\nReferences.\nBaumgarten, Linda: \"What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America\", Yale University Press, 2002.

        "title": "Dominican Professional Baseball League",
        "text": "The Dominican Republic Professional Baseball League ( or LIDOM) is a professional baseball winter league consisting of six teams spread across the Dominican Republic; it is the highest level of professional baseball played in the Dominican Republic. The league's players include many prospects that go on to play Major League Baseball in the United States while also signing many current MLB veterans. The champion of LIDOM advances to play in the yearly Caribbean Series.\nEach team plays a fifty-game round-robin schedule that begins in mid October and runs to the end of December. The top four teams engage in another round-robin schedule with 18 games per team from the end of December to the end of January; the top two teams in those standings then play a best-of-nine series for the national title. The league's champion advances to the Caribbean Series to play against the representatives from Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Puerto Rico.\nHistory.\nFor his close involvement in the Dominican league's establishment and early development, Pedro Miguel Caratini has been called \"the father of Dominican baseball\".\nDuring the years 1930-1963, military dictator General Rafael Trujillo can be credited with furthering the sport of baseball in Dominican Republic. Trujillo encouraged many sugar refineries to create teams of cane cutting laborers to play baseball during the idle months of cultivation. Fostering high levels of competition, the organization structure continued to mature stimulating growth in the intensity and popularity of the game.\nIn 1937, teams of the Dominican Republic signed a large number of players from the Negro leagues of the United States. These players were given large salaries by Dominican men with money and political power. Among these players were baseball stars James Thomas \"Cool Papa\" Bell and Satchel Paige. However, these contracts exhausted team finances, leading to a decline of Dominican baseball until 1950.\nFounding teams.\nIn the early 1900s, four Dominican teams formed. These teams still exist today, and form the foundation of Dominican professional baseball:\nCultural impact.\nBaseball was first brought to the Dominican Republic by Cubans fleeing the Ten Years' War. At first, it struggled to gain popularity, being confined mostly to the Cuban exiles, but its popularity grew as more and more native-born Dominicans took it up. The growing popularity of the sport led to the formation of LIDOM. The formation of the new domestic baseball league allowed Dominican players to flourish and public interest to grow. The sport's domestic popularity and the new league increased the bond that many spectators felt with their teams; even today, many Dominicans feel tightly connected to the sport.\nCommunity-level impact.\nAs a cultural icon of the Dominican Republic, baseball holds a strong presence in many parts the country. Surrounded by working class neighborhoods, baseball stadiums in larger Dominican cities are routinely maintained. Owners of big businesses like sugar refineries funded the construction of these fields to benefit from the games. Games in these stadiums attract major crowds and a sense of community can be observed. Like their American counterparts, these \"latinized\" games exude free-spiritedness, social cohesion, and festivity from the fans and players alike. In the Dominican Republic, baseball players are regaled as sports heroes and function as role models to their fan base. This idolization is covered by the media more so than in the United States.\nThe Dominican Republic has the largest economy in the Caribbean and Central American region. The country has the fastest growing economy in Latin America, and a growing middle-class population. However income inequality persists in this developing nation, according to statistics in 2016, 30.5 percent of Dominicans lived below the nation's poverty line, while 5.5% of Dominicans were unemployed. With poverty preventing certain segments of the Dominican population a chance to get a higher education, many look up to the success of those who become famous baseball players, and see baseball as an escape from poverty. Because of this, children begin playing organized baseball as early as six years old, and compete with others in leagues with the hopes of being recognized by baseball scouts.\nSome argue that the perception of baseball as economic salvation is in reality detrimental to the youth of the Dominican Republic, as it promotes seeking baseball success at all costs, at the expense of pursuing higher education.\nAmerican hegemony inside Dominican baseball.\nAfter Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba and the subsequent U.S. blockade, scouts of the majors turned their sights towards the Dominican Republic. Posed with the opportunity to acquire quality talent at a reasonable price, major league teams established \"working relationships\" with Dominican professional teams. Since the 1950s, all 30 MLB franchises have established baseball training academies in the Dominican Republic which are tasked by their respective teams to condition and prepare young Dominican prospects for a chance at further developing in the United States. Having produced many successful athletes from these academies, these academies undercut the reliance of U.S. teams on Dominican baseball organizations.\nChampionship history.\n\"*Two Dominican teams participated in the Serie del Caribe in 2008\"\n\"*Championships won before LIDOM (1951)\""

        "text": "Bruce Arthur Norris (February 19, 1924 – January 1, 1986) was owner of the Detroit Red Wings professional ice hockey team from 1952 to 1982. He was the son of James E. Norris and half-brother of James D. Norris. Members of the Norris family owned the Red Wings for almost fifty years before selling the franchise to Mike Ilitch in 1982.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in Chicago, Norris attended Yale University. After graduation, he became heavily involved in the Norris Grain Company and an avid cattle rancher based in rural Illinois. Bruce Norris served as an ensign with the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater during World War II. He married Naoma Donnelley on June 28, 1947. The couple divorced in 1949. He remarried in 1958 to Patricia Anne Shephard. That marriage ended in divorce and in 1967 he married the former Mrs. Armene Lamson Clark of Seattle. They divorced in 1970. Norris died at age 61 on January 1, 1986, at Stony Brook University Hospital in Stony Brook, Long Island, New York.\nIce hockey.\nNorris attended Yale University and played defence on the varsity team, like his father, who also played ice hockey during his youth. In 1952, James E. Norris Sr owned the Detroit Red Wings, a share of the Chicago Blackhawks, and mortgages on Madison Square Garden, where the New York Rangers played, and the Boston Garden, home of the Boston Bruins. After his death on December 4, 1952, the Norris interests were broken up. Bruce and his sister Marguerite Norris inherited the Red Wings and Marguerite was named president. After winning the Stanley Cup in 1955 Bruce bought out his sister's shares to become the sole owner of the Red Wings. He owned the team until 1982 when it was sold to Mike Ilitch.\nIn 1957, Norris ordered the trade of Ted Lindsay from the Red Wings to Chicago because of Lindsay's efforts to form the National Hockey League Players' Association. His role in the union busting efforts are dramatized in the TV movie, \"Net Worth.\"\nNorris was elected the chairman of the National Hockey League's Board of Governors. Bruce Norris was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969, joining his father and brother. Bruce Norris' name was engraved on the Stanley Cup as a Vice President in 1952, 1954 and 1955. In 1976, Bruce Norris was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to hockey in the United States."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Tampa Bay Rays, and San Diego Padres.\nEarly life.\nBartlett grew up in Lodi, California, and attended St. Mary's High School in Stockton, California. Bartlett went to San Joaquin Delta College and the University of Oklahoma, where he played for the Oklahoma Sooners baseball team. In 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.\nProfessional career.\nBartlett was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 13th round (390th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft. In July 2002, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins for Brian Buchanan after the Padres had drafted shortstop Khalil Greene in the first round.\nBartlett made his MLB debut on August 3, 2004. He recorded his first five-hit game in the Twins' 11-5 victory over the Kansas City Royals on August 6, 2006. When on the Twins, Bartlett was one of four players known for speed and small ball, nicknamed \"the Piranhas\" by Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén. The Twins embraced the term during the 2006 season. The other Piranhas were Jason Tyner, Luis Castillo, and Nick Punto.\nIn 2007, he led all major league shortstops in errors with 26. On November 28, 2007, the Twins traded Bartlett along with Matt Garza and Eduardo Morlan to the Tampa Bay Rays for Delmon Young, Jason Pridie, and Brendan Harris.\nOn October 22, 2008, Bartlett stole a base in the fifth inning of Game 1 of the World Series, earning America a free taco from Taco Bell.

He finished the year batting .320, which was, at the time, the highest batting average in Rays history. On July 23 of the same year, against the Chicago White Sox, he grounded out to Alexei Ramírez for the final out of Mark Buehrle's perfect game. Bartlett had a 19-game hitting streak during the season, which remains the longest hitting streak in Rays history.\nBartlett played in 135 games for the Rays in 2010 and posted a batting line of .254/.324/.350. On December 17, 2010, Bartlett was traded to the San Diego Padres for Adam Russell, Cesar Ramos, Brandon Gomes, and Cole Figueroa.\nBartlett was the Padres regular shortstop in 2011 and finished the season batting .245 with 2 home runs and 23 stolen bases. He had the lowest slugging percentage of all major league ballplayers with 512 or more plate appearances, at .307.\nThe Padres opened 2012 with Bartlett again as their everyday shortstop but he played his last game for the team on May 14, batting .133 with 4 RBI over 29 games. Three days later he was moved to the disabled list with a right knee strain. On the same day, his fellow middle infielder Orlando Hudson was released and the Padres brought up Everth Cabrera and Alexi Amarista in corresponding moves. On August 20, 2012, the Padres requested unconditional release waivers on Bartlett.\nAfter sitting out the 2013 season, he signed a non roster contract with the Minnesota Twins on November 11, 2013. After playing in three games for the Twins, Bartlett retired on April 19, 2014."

Martin is the all-time most successful coach in NCAA Division I college baseball. Upon the completion of his career, Martin had compiled a record of 2,029 wins, 736 losses and four ties over 40 seasons of collegiate coaching. \nBiography.\nMichael David Martin Sr. was a native of Charlotte, North Carolina. He began his collegiate playing career at Wingate Junior College, where he was a Junior College All-American. He then transferred to Florida State, where he played from 1965 to 1966 and graduated in 1966. During his years as the center fielder at Florida State, Martin hit .354, and earned all-District honors in his senior season and played in the 1965 College World Series. After his college career was over, Martin played professional baseball in the New York Mets and Detroit Tigers minor league organizations for three seasons before beginning his career in coaching.\nMartin began his career in coaching at the junior high school level. His first stint as a college coach, surprisingly, came in a different sport, basketball, when Martin became the head basketball coach at Tallahassee Community College during the 1970–1971 season.\nIt was in 1975, when Woody Woodward took over the head coaching job at Florida State, that Martin would be reunited with his alma mater. Martin served as an assistant coach under Woodward for four seasons, and then for another season under Dick Howser. Howser would get his chance to manage the New York Yankees and Martin stepped into the head coaching role at Florida State in 1980.\nThough Martin's teams did not win a national title, his tenure at Florida State was marked with many honors and feats. Florida State, as of Martin's retirement in 2019, had made 43 straight postseason appearances (41 under Martin), at that time the longest active streak in the country. Martin's Seminoles won eight Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championships and appeared in 17 College World Series.\nMartin's players, which include many college and professional standouts such as Deion Sanders, J. D. Drew, Doug Mientkiewicz, Stephen Drew, Paul Wilson, Lincoln R. \"Link\" Jarrett, and Buster Posey, have excelled as well. More than 70 of Martin's players have been named All-Americans, five have been named national player of the year, four have won the Golden Spikes Award, considered to be the most prestigious individual award in amateur baseball, and two - J.D. Drew and Posey - have won the Dick Howser Trophy, considered to be the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy for baseball. Martin won the ACC Coach of the Year award seven times (1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2012).\nOn May 5, 2018, Martin reached 1,976 career wins, surpassing legendary coach Augie Garrido to become the most successful coach in college baseball history. On June 18, 2018, it was announced that Martin would retire following the 2019 season.\nFlorida State's baseball team plays on Mike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium, dedicated in 2005.\nOn March 9, 2019, Martin became the first coach to achieve 2,000 career wins with a 5–2 victory over Virginia Tech in the second game of a doubleheader. In 2019, Martin was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.\nMartin died from complications from Lewy body dementia in Tallahassee, Florida, on February 1, 2024, at the age of 79."

        "title": "St. Lawrence Saints men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The St. Lawrence Saints Men's Ice Hockey team, colloquially known as the \"Skating Saints\", is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents St. Lawrence University. The Saints are a member of the ECAC Hockey. They have played at Appleton Arena in Canton, New York, since 1951. Prior to the arena's construction, the men's team played outdoors at the current location of Whitman Hall.\nHistory.\nSince the team's inception in 1925, the Saints men's hockey program has been a competitive team at the top ranks of American college hockey. Due to World War II, there were no teams during the 1941–42 season, or the 1943–44 through 1945–46 seasons.\nThe team plays in the ECAC Hockey League, one of six Division I leagues. This league currently boasts six Ivy League teams, including perennial powers Cornell and Harvard as well as six colleges from upstate New York and Connecticut. Since the inception of the ECAC in 1961, SLU has won six ECAC tournament titles and two ECAC regular season titles.\nSince the 1951–52 season, SLU has made sixteen NCAA tournament appearances. St. Lawrence has been to the Frozen Four and its antecedent the four team NCAA Championships a total of nine times, playing in the title games in 1961 and 1988. St. Lawrence has accomplished this despite being, at approximately 2,000 students, one of the smallest colleges to play at the Division I level. A Division III school in all other sports, St. Lawrence has maintained Division I \"play-up\" status in hockey thanks to a 2004 NCAA resolution, allowing it (along with 11 other schools) to offer Division I scholarships in only one sport. St. Lawrence did not offer grant-in-aid hockey scholarships until the mid-1990s.\nIn 1988, the Saints played in the NCAA national championship game at the Olympic Arena in Lake Placid, NY, losing to Lake Superior State University 4–3 in overtime. The 1987–88 season was the most successful in team history, with an overall record of 29–9–0. In 2000, the Saints played in the longest NCAA tournament game on record; a 3–2, quadruple overtime victory over Boston University. The win advanced the Saints to the Frozen Four, where the team eventually lost to Boston College in the National Semifinals. The Men's program has produced 28 All-American players, seven ECAC tournament MVPs, six ECAC players of the year, four ECAC rookies of the year, and nine Hobey Baker Memorial Award finalists.\nFrom 1985 until 2012, Joe Marsh was the head coach at St. Lawrence. In 2007, he won his 400th Division I game (all at St. Lawrence) placing him in 6th place among active NCAA Division I coaches in career wins. Marsh is a two-time winner of the Spencer Penrose Award given to the best college coach of the year.\nFollowing Marsh's retirement in 2012, former Ottawa Senators assistant coach, and Saints alumnus, Greg Carvel took over head coaching duties. In 2016, Carvel departed the program to take the same role at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Following the departure of Carvel, St. Lawrence named former Clarkson University head coach Mark Morris as the 14th head coach in program history.\nBeginning with the 2019–20 season, the Saints announced Brent Brekke as the 15th head coach in program history.\nSt. Lawrence's biggest hockey rival is Clarkson University, located in Potsdam, ten miles from the St. Lawrence campus. For many years, the swing through the North Country has been considered to be one of the most grueling road trips in college hockey.\nSt. Lawrence plays its home hockey games at Appleton Arena, a classic old time hockey barn which has seen many upgrades since opening in 1950 with a 4–2 St. Lawrence win over Dartmouth College.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nUniforms.\nTraditionally, the Saints home jersey is white with scarlet shoulders and brown trim. The end of the sleeves and bottom of the sweater feature scarlet and brown stripes. The school's crest and the player's name and number all appear in scarlet with brown trim. The road jersey are identically designed, but with the white and scarlet portions reversed. In 2002, a lace-up neck was adopted by the men's team.\nIn 2001, in honor of Appleton Arena's 50th anniversary, an alternate \"throw-back\" jersey was introduced for the men's team. The alternate jersey is white but does not feature colored shoulders. The StL logo is significantly smaller, and \"St. Lawrence\" is spelled out across the chest. The school seal also appears on both shoulders of the sweater. This jersey continued to be used occasionally until gaining popularity during the 2006–07 season, when the men's team exhibited frequent success when wearing the alternate jerseys on home ice. As a result, the alternate jersey quickly became the staple home jersey. Beginning with the 2012–13 season, St. Lawrence retired the StL logo from the red road jerseys as well, and adopted a design that matched the home white sweaters.\nOriginally, the women's program wore jerseys that were identical to the men's jerseys. However, in fall 2005, the women's jerseys were designed to be unique from the men's jerseys. The scarlet and brown on the shoulders of the home jersey was extended down the arms until it met with the trim at the end of the sleeve. The player's number appears within the scarlet portion and is white with brown trim. The road jerseys feature a similar pattern, but the shoulders and sleeves are brown with white trim (a reverse of the traditional road-jersey scheme) on a red background.\nIn tribute to Mike Pelletier and Rich Stewart, teammates on the 1988 NCAA finalist team who were among the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the 2001–02 men's team wore a patch on the shoulder of their jerseys with both players' initials. Pelletier and Stewart had both been employees of Cantor Fitzgerald working in the World Trade Center.\nIn the 2008–09 season, St. Lawrence, along with all other ECAC Hockey teams, participated in Coaches vs. Cancer's \"Pink at the Rink\" fundraiser. The Men's team wore black sweaters with pink and white trim while the Women's team wore pink uniforms with white trim. The jerseys, along with pink ties worn by the coaches and pink sticks were then auctioned off to raise funds for breast cancer research. (The Men's team only wore the pink jerseys during warmups, as visiting team Harvard had forgotten to bring their home white jerseys.)\nStatistical Leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nHockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nSource:\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nHobey Baker Award Finalists\nSpencer Penrose Award\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nRookie of the Year\nKen Dryden Award\nKen Dryden Award\nMost Outstanding Player in tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of St. Lawrence alumni who have played on an Olympic team.\nSt. Lawrence Saints Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the St. Lawrence men's ice hockey program who were elected into the St. Lawrence University Athletic Hall of Fame.\nSaints in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "William Edward Berry (born 1942) is a retired American basketball coach.\nEarly life and college career.\nBerry was born in Winnemucca, Nevada and graduated from Humboldt County High School in 1960. He then attended Michigan State University. From 1961 to 1964, Berry played on the Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team under coach Forddy Anderson. At Michigan State, Berry was the top team rebounder for the 1962–63 season with 184 total rebounds and 9.2 per game. Berry earned his bachelor's degree in 1965 and master's degree in 1969 from Michigan State, both in physical education.\nCoaching career.\nBerry began his coaching career in 1966 as head varsity basketball coach at Highlands High School of North Highlands, California and stayed as coach until 1969. After completing his master's degree at Michigan State, Berry became head coach at Cosumnes River Junior College from 1970 to 1972. Then, Berry became an assistant coach at the NCAA Division I level with California until 1977. Berry then returned to his alma mater Michigan State to be an assistant coach under Jud Heathcote and was part of the coaching staff of the 1979 NCAA championship team that featured Magic Johnson.\nFrom 1979 to 1989, Berry was the head men's basketball coach at San Jose State. For the San Jose State Spartans, Berry had a 142–144 record, then the Spartans' second-highest win total under one coach. Under Berry, San Jose State had a 17–12 record in the 1979–80 season, won the 1980 PCAA tournament, and made the 1980 NCAA tournament. In a 21–9 season in 1980–81, San Jose State qualified for the 1981 National Invitation Tournament. San Jose State also had three straight seasons over .500 from 1984 to 1987. However, the 1988–89 Spartans finished 5–23. In January 1989, when the team was 5–11, 10 of the 14 players on the Spartans men's basketball team accused Berry of \"mental cruelty\" and refused to play or practice under Berry as coach. However, the players declined to provide specific examples. Berry then organized a new team of walk-on athletes, including star football player Johnny Johnson. San Jose State dismissed Berry after the season on March 24, 1989.\nAfter San Jose State, Berry entered the NBA as a scout and assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings in 1989. He transferred to the Houston Rockets as a scout in 1991 and then assistant coach in February 1992 under Rudy Tomjanovich. Berry was an assistant coach to the Rockets 1994 and 1995 championship teams. From 1999 to 2003, Berry was an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls\nBerry was an assistant under Tim Floyd until Floyd resigned on Christmas Eve (December 24) of 2001, when the Bulls named Berry as interim head coach. Berry coached two games, both losses, and Bill Cartwright became permanent head coach effective December 28. On September 7, 2006, the Washington Wizards announced that Bill Berry would join the team as an assistant coach to head coach Eddie Jordan.\nPersonal life.\nBill Berry has been married to Clarice \"Reese\" Berry since 1963 and had two children. The Berry family lived in Morgan Hill, California, during Bill Berry's tenure at San Jose State. Their son Ricky Berry (1964–1989) played college basketball at San Jose State under Bill Berry and in the NBA for the Sacramento Kings before committing suicide in 1989."

        "text": "The men's combined was held on Tuesday, 14 February, two days after the downhill. The combined competition, as the name suggests, is a combination where the times in the downhill racing and the slalom events are added. One run of downhill and two runs of slalom are used to determine overall ranking in the combined event. All three runs were held in a single day.\nNorway's Kjetil André Aamodt was defending Olympic champion from Salt Lake City in 2002, while Benjamin Raich of Austria was the reigning world champion. Raich led the Combined standings on the World Cup entering the Olympics, followed by Michael Walchhofer (Austria) and Bode Miller (USA) in a tie for second.\nMiller, the leader after the downhill portion, was disqualified in the first slalom run for straddling a gate. This left Raich in the lead going into the final run of slalom, followed by Ivica Kostelić and young American Ted Ligety. Ligety scorched the final run for the gold medal, while Raich skied out. Aamodt did not start the event after a knee injury, and Filip Trejbal had to withdraw after a spectacular crash which delayed the event for a prolonged period.\nThese were the last Olympics to use the traditional combined format (one downhill run and two slalom runs). Starting in 2010, the Olympics are scheduled to switch to the \"super-combined\" format (one run each of downhill &amp; slalom) for the combined event. First run on the World Cup circuit in 2005 at Wengen, the \"super-combi\" format was first used at the world championships in 2007.\nResults.\nThe results of the men's combined event in Alpine skiing at the 2006 Winter Olympics."

He and Börje Salming combined to make one of the best 1–2 defensive punches in Toronto Maple Leafs history during the 1970s.\nCareer Overview.\nTurnbull played 628 career NHL games, scoring 123 goals and 317 assists for 440 points. In his best offensive season, (1976–77 while with the Maple Leafs), he set career highs with 22 goals, 57 assists, 79 points, and a +47 plus/minus rating. The 79 points still stands over 40 years later as the Maple Leaf team record for most points in a season by a defenceman. He also still holds the NHL record for most goals in a game by a defenceman, with 5 in a game on February 2, 1977, in a 9–1 victory against the Detroit Red Wings. Turnbull only had five shots in the game, making him the first player in NHL history to score five goals on five shots. Turnbull was outstanding in the 1978 playoff series against the New York Islanders, eventually won by Toronto 4 games to 3, anchoring the team’s defensive corps after an eye injury forced all-star defenceman Börje Salming out of the Maple Leafs line-up.\nEarly in the 1981-82 season, Turnbull was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for veteran forward Billy Harris and defenseman John Gibson. Turnbull's time with the Kings was brief, playing just 42-games, but one of them was quite memorable. On December 12, 1981, Turnbull scored four goals in a 7–5 Kings victory over the Vancouver Canucks.\nTurnbull joined the Penguins for the 1982-83 season but played just six games for them before a back injury forced him out of the lineup and into retirement.\nTurnbull is currently the IT Director at Martin Chevrolet in Torrance, California, United States."

He was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. He played college football for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies.\nFerguson was also a member of the Minnesota Vikings, Atlanta Falcons and Omaha Nighthawks.\nEarly years.\nFerguson played free safety and wide receiver at Spring Woods High School in Houston, where he was a four-time letter winner. He was named Defensive Player of the Year by the Houston Touchdown Club as a 1997 senior, when he made 96 tackles and 6 interceptions. On offense, he caught 32 passes for 999 yards and 5 touchdowns during his senior year. He won all-district and All-Greater Houston honors on both sides of the ball and was named offensive MVP of the Houston Coaches' Classic All-star game the summer after his senior year.

        "text": "The 13th International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Championships in Athletics () was an international athletics competition that was held in Daegu, South Korea. It started on 27 August 2011 and finished on 4 September 2011.\nThe United States topped the medal standings in the competition with 28 (12 gold, 9 silver, and 7 bronze). During the competition, 41 national records, 4 area records, 3 championship records, and 1 world record was set.\nThe championships were heavily affected by post-championship doping cases, particularly from the Russian team, who in subsequent years were stripped of eleven medals, seven of them gold.\nBidding process.\nOn 4 April 2006, the World Athletics (Formerly known as IAAF) announced that nine countries (United States, South Korea, Australia, Sweden, Spain, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Croatia and Morocco) had submitted expressions of interest for hosting the 2011 World Championships.\nCandidates.\nWhen the seeking deadline passed on 1 December 2006, four candidate cities (Brisbane, Daegu, Moscow and Gothenburg) had confirmed their candidatures. Gothenburg backed out later that month, citing lack of financial support from the Swedish government.\nBrisbane was announced as the Australian candidate with the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre (formerly ANZ Stadium) as the proposed venue for a championships to be held in July or August. The stadium previously hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and 2001 Goodwill Games. Brisbane also had an unsuccessful bid for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics.\nDaegu was the city chosen for the Korean bid, following on from an initial application to host the 2009 edition. Daegu had previously hosted the 2003 Summer Universiade and three matches of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The World Championships in Athletics had never been staged in mainland Asia, although it has taken place twice in Japan.\nThe Russian bid had Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium as the proposed venue. The city hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships.\nAmong the intent candidates were Casablanca (Morocco) and Split (Croatia), both of which were failed bidders for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. The Spanish candidate was rumored to be either Madrid or Valencia, but Spain eventually settled for Barcelona as a candidate for the 2013 World Championships in Athletics. The United States intent candidate city matched those bidding for the 2016 Summer Olympics: Chicago, Los Angeles or San Francisco.\nSelection.\nThe IAAF announced Daegu as the winning candidate at the IAAF Council Meeting in Mombasa on 27 March 2007. Its victory was based on \"the quality of the stadiums and [meeting] the need for good crowds.\" IAAF's officials also praised Daegu's \"ambition and challenging spirit\" as key to its winning bid. Both Moscow and Brisbane later confirmed their candidacy to host the 2013 World Championships in Athletics – a selection process won by the Russian capital.\nResults.\nMen.\nThe events in the men's section ended with a world record in 4 x 100 metres relay set by Jamaica and several world's leading results. Jamaica dominated the sprinting events, while Kenya and Ethiopia dominated the longer track events. In the field events, the United States and Germany were most successful, winning four and three gold medals respectively. Yohan Blake and Usain Bolt, both from Jamaica, won two gold medals, being the most successful athletes in the men's events.\nIn the 100 m final the largely favored Usain Bolt was disqualified for a false start, enabling Yohan Blake to win the crown with a time of 9.92 s. In the 200 m Bolt won with a time of 19.40 s, which was the fastest time ever not to be a world record at that point. Blake and Bolt, along with countrymen Nesta Carter and Michael Frater, ran in the 4 x 100 metres relay, setting a new world record with a time of 37.04 s. In the 10,000 metres event, World Champion Kenenisa Bekele did not finish the race. The world record holder in 800 m, David Rudisha, won the event with his first gold medal at the World Championships. On the last day, Kenyan Abel Kirui became the third marathon winner to retain the title at the next World Championships, after Abel Anton and Jaouad Gharib.\nMost of the field events ended with new winners, but Dwight Phillips retained the long jump title, becoming only the second man after Ivan Pedroso to win four golds at the World Championships in this event.\nEthiopia's Imane Merga was originally awarded the bronze medal in the Men's 5000 metres, but he was later disqualified for having run inside the curb of the running track for some 10 to 15 metres. His teammate Dejen Gebremeskel was elevated to the bronze medal as a result.\nCuba's Dayron Robles finished first in the race of the Men's 110 metres hurdles, but was disqualified for interfering with Liu Xiang twice before and over the last barrier. Jason Richardson was awarded the Gold, Liu the Silver, and Andy Turner promoted to the Bronze medal position.\nWomen.\nDuring the championships, Russia was the most successful country in the women's events, winning seven gold medals, followed by the United States with six. Most successful female athlete was Allyson Felix having won two relay golds and silver and bronze in her individual events. On the first day of the Championships, the athletes of Kenya made an astonishing performance, winning all six medals available in the two events. Kenya also dominated the long-distance events, while Jamaica and the United States the sprinting. In the field events, Russia was initially dominant, winning four gold medals.\nFollowing a series of retests of stored samples and biological passports, a number of athletes were stripped of medals because of doping. Nine medals in eight events were forfeited for doping, eight of them from Russia, including five gold medals. The only Russian medals that survived the post-championship doping purge were two gold medals in the high jump and the hammer throw, and a bronze medals in the pole vault and the 400 metre hurdles. Of the four surviving medalists, a further three were eventually banned for doping.\nThe amended results left the United States the clear leading nation in women's athletics.\nField.\n Original gold medalist Mariya Abakumova of Russia was stripped of her gold medal.&lt;br&gt;\n Original gold medalist Tatyana Chernova of Russia was stripped of her gold medal on 29 November 2016 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, with Ennis and Oeser promoted to gold and silver respectively and the bronze awarded to Karolina Tymińska of Poland.\nAnti-doping programme.\nOn 4 November 2011 the IAAF reported that 2 of the 468 urine samples had produced adverse analytical findings. The samples of Portuguese runner Sara Moreira, a finalist in the women's steeplechase, and Korean relay runner Hee-Nam Lim had both tested positive for methylhexaneamine. Analysis of blood samples is still ongoing.\nIn March 2012 the Trinidad and Tobago track and field authorities announced that Semoy Hackett had tested positive for methylhexaneamine at the Trinidad and Tobago national championships prior to the World Championships. Her results in the women's 100 metres were annulled and the Trinidadian 4 x 100-metre relay team were also disqualified from fourth place.\nAn anonymous poll conducted by the World Anti-Doping Agency at the event showed that an estimated 29% of the athletes present at the World Championships had used a banned substance within the last 12 months.\nMedal table.\nOriginally, host nation South Korea failed to win any medals at these championships, a fate shared with Sweden in 1995 and Canada in 2001.\nHowever, in 2015, South Korean athlete Kim Hyun-sub was promoted from sixth place to bronze medalist in the 20 km walk after three Russian race walkers were disqualified for doping offences.\nParticipating nations.\nOn the entry lists prior to the competition, a total of 1943 athletes from 202 national teams were set to participate in the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. The number of accredited athletes that actually participated at the event was 1848, while the total of countries represented was 204."

        "title": "1987 Pan American Games",
        "text": "The 1987 Pan American Games, officially known as the X Pan American Games, was a major international multi-sport event held in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, on August 7–23, 1987. Over 4,300 athletes from 38 countries in the Americas competed in 297 events in 30 sports, earning 1,015 medals. Events were held at 23 venues in and around Indianapolis. The official mascot for the games was Amigo, a green parrot.\nHost city selection.\nSantiago, Chile, was originally named the host of the tenth Pan American Games, but it withdrew in 1983 due to political and financial problems. Quito, Ecuador, was named to replace Santiago, but it also withdrew, in late 1984. Desperate, the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) held a new election. Indianapolis was planning to bid on the 1991 Games, but, at the request of the United States Olympic Committee, submitted a bid for 1987. Since many sports facilities were already in place, PASO announced on December 18, 1984, that Indianapolis would be the host. Havana, Cuba, was also interested, but PASO appeased Fidel Castro, who had threatened to boycott the games, by agreeing to give Havana the 1991 games provided that Cuba participated at Indianapolis.\nOrganization.\nThe city of Indianapolis created an organizing committee called Pan American Ten/Indianapolis (PAX/I). It had eighteen operating divisions, 300 paid staff, and 37,000 volunteers.\nSymbols.\nThe logo of the 1987 Pan Am Games consisted of five stylized X's, the Roman numeral for ten. Designed by Michael Hayes of the JMH Corporation in Indianapolis, the seven colors represented the wildlife and flags of western hemisphere countries. The mascot was Amigo, a green parrot, designed by Jerry Reynolds of Perennial Pictures in Indianapolis. Amigo represented friendliness and festivity. The official music of the X Pan American Games was Pan American Fanfare by Lalo Schifrin.\nBroadcasting rights.\nThe rights for the 1987 games were won by CBS with a bid of $4,000,000, and Brent Musburger hosted. CBS aired 26 hours of coverage, all on weekend afternoons, including live coverage of the Opening Ceremony from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Additionally, CBS provided the world feed. Because these games were first since the Cuban Revolution in which Cuban athletes were competing in the United States, the ratings were boosted by their participation, providing a United States-Cuba showdown in many events.\nVenues.\nThe 1987 Pan Am Games were held at a total of 23 sites. The athletes village, which provided lodging and dining for the athletes, was located at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Lawrence, Indiana.\nGames.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was held on the main straight of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the site of the Indianapolis 500. Crowd size reports range from 69,518, the official capacity of the stadium proper, to 80,000. The show, \"The Magic that is America\", was produced by The Walt Disney Company at a cost of several million dollars. The 6,500 performers made it, at that time, both the largest outdoor live entertainment show held in the United States and the largest opening ceremony of the Pan Am games. The organizers had originally budgeted $2.5 million for the opening and closing ceremonies, but all the proposals by Disney exceeded that figure, so the committee decided to use that entire amount to stage only the opening ceremony.\nSandi Patty was a featured singer and the show included hot air balloons and military fighter jets. Dignitaries included IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut III, Indiana Governor Robert D. Orr, and PASO President Mario Vazquez Raña.\nU.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush officially opened the games, and additional security protocols for his presence led to about 5000 people being delayed in lines, with twelve people fainting.\nFlag bearers in the Parade of Nations included the games' oldest athlete, 70-year-old yachtsman Durward Knowles of the Bahamas, basketball star José Ortiz of Puerto Rico, and baseball pitcher Jim Abbott of the United States. The Canadian delegation engaged with the crowd by playing frisbee with them.\nIn keeping with Pan American Games tradition, a flame was lit at Cerro de la Estrella in Mexico City. The flame was flown to Chicago on July 16, and was carried along an 1,100-mile torch relay that encircled the state of Indiana before arriving in Indianapolis on August 7. Money raised during the torch relay was donated to Indianapolis's Riley Hospital for Children, which received more than $10,000. The final leg of the torch relay had the flame passed from Indianapolis-born basketball player Oscar Robertson to gymnast Kristie Phillips to sprinter Wilma Rudolph, also from Indianapolis, who lit the cauldron.\nDuring the opening ceremony, a plane chartered by anti-Castro Cuban-American activists flew a banner urging Cuban athletes to defect.\nParticipating nations.\n38 nations participated in the tenth Pan American Games. Four countries competed for the first time in 1987: Aruba, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Grenada.\nProtests involving the Cuban delegation during the games.\nTension between Cuba and the United States had already been an issue with the selection of Indianapolis over Havana for the site of the games, and a Cuban boycott had been avoided only when Fidel Castro received a promise that the 1991 Pan American Games would be held in Havana. After the incident with a plane flying a banner urging Cuban athletes to defect in the opening ceremony, Cuban immigrants to the United States continued to use the games as a way to confront the Castro regime, using the Cuban athletes as a proxy. This games marked the first time since the Cuban Revolution that Cuban athletes had participated in the United States. At a baseball game in Bush Stadium between Cuba and the Netherlands Antilles the day after the opening ceremony, Cuban-American protestors taunted the Cuban players, threw flyers at them, and mocked them with offers of cash. A fight broke out, but only one bystander was injured and hospitalized after Indianapolis police broke up the fight by preventing the Cuban players from entering the stands. At a subsequent game against Puerto Rico, some Cuban players were able to enter the stands to chase protestors before being stopped.\nDuring boxing events at the Indiana Convention Center, anti-Castro Cuban-American protestors mocked the Cuban boxers from the stands. The police were unable to stop the Cuban boxers from entering the stands and punching the protestors in retaliation. According to witnesses, up to a dozen Cuban boxers, including Pablo Romero, as well as a hundred spectators were involved. Two people were hospitalized. After these incidents Manuel Gonzalez Guerra, who was Cuba's top sports official, publicly demanded that organizers keep the anti-Castro protestors away from the Cuban athletes. In private, he also unsuccessfully asked the Indianapolis police chief to lock the activists up. Mark Miles, the president of the organizing committee, made a phone call to the Ronald Reagan administration in the White House, who subsequently pressed Cuban-American activists groups to dial down the pressure by the final week.\nMedal count.\n\"To sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the icon next to the column title.\"\n The medal counts for the United States and Canada differ in various sources.\nIndianapolis Museum of Art exhibition.\nCoinciding with the Pan American Games was the Indianapolis Museum of Art exhibition \"Art of the Fantastic: Latin America, 1920–1987\". The exhibition presented 125 works by artists from a variety of nations, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Puerto Rico, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Well-known artists such as Frida Kahlo and Roberto Matta were featured, as well as artists who had never exhibited outside their native country. The show was the first large-scale presentation of 20th-century Latin American art in the U.S. in over 20 years and was the museum's first contemporary exhibition to travel.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony was initially planned to take place at the American Legion Mall, a popular site for open air events on the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza in downtown Indianapolis. However, in April, the management of the American Legion objected because as part of the closing protocol, the flag of the host country (the U.S.) would be lowered and that of the host country of the next Pan American games (Cuba) would be raised to fly by itself. In June, the organizing committee decided to relocate the ceremony to the Hoosier Dome. Because the gymnastics finals were scheduled to end only a few hours before the closing ceremony, it was decided to use only a portion of the dome, limiting attendance to 35,000 instead of 60,000. Despite the initial budget for all ceremonies having been allocated exclusively to the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony was staged for $500,000.\nThe headline act was Cuban American Gloria Estefan and her band, Miami Sound Machine, chosen, according to the organizing committee, because her album \"Let It Loose\" had just achieved platinum sales. The choice of Castro-critic Estefan, who had fled with her family during the Cuban Revolution while her father stayed behind and was imprisoned, led the Cuban delegation to again threaten to boycott. In the end, they attended the closing ceremony, but returned to the stands and sat during the dancing. The ceremony ended with indoor fireworks, and the spectators were invited to exit the building to see a 25-minute outdoor fireworks display.\nImpact.\nThe Pan Am Games brought about $175 million (1988 USD, $355.1 million 2016 USD) to Indianapolis's economy. Hosting the Games cost about $30 million. Indianapolis was the first Pan American Games host city to break even financially.\nHosting the games also attracted many sports organizations to consider Indianapolis as a site for their headquarters, most notably the National Collegiate Athletic Association."

        "text": "Snowboarding is a sport at the Winter Olympic Games. It was first included in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic program between 1992 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, giant slalom was expanded to add head-to-head racing and was renamed parallel giant slalom. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles. On July 11, 2011, the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board approved the addition of Ski and Snowboard Slopestyle to the Winter Olympics roster of events, effective in 2014. The decision was announced via press conference from the IOC's meeting in Durban, South Africa. A fifth event, parallel slalom, was added only for 2014. Big air was added for 2018.\nSix athletes have won at least two medals. Shaun White of the United States is the only triple gold medalist. Philipp Schoch of Switzerland, along with Chloe Kim and Seth Wescott of the United States, are the only double gold medalists. Karine Ruby of France and Americans Ross Powers and Danny Kass also won two medals. As of the 2014 Winter Olympics, 90 medals (30 of each color) have been awarded since 1998, and have been won by snowboarders from 21 National Olympic Committees.\nEvents.\nMixed.\nNote 1.

        "text": "1920s.\nOn August 5, 1921, the first Major League Baseball game was broadcast on the radio by Harold Arlin. Harold Arlin was an engineer for Westinghouse Electric in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Arlin was offered an announcer's job for the KDKA radio station. At the time, this was one of the few radio stations in the country. In 1920, Arlin was asked to read the returns from that year's presidential race. His work in the early 1920s led him to getting a full-time job as an announcer on the radio.\nHarold Arlin was just 25 years old when he called the action from a box seat at Forbes Field. The game that was played was between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies which ended in an 8–5 Pirates victory. To call the game, he used a converted telephone as a microphone. Arlin worked for a company called KDKA, which was the first commercial radio station in the United States.\nArlin soon helped sports broadcasting to become a sensation. Fans were so interested in Arlin's broadcasts that record numbers of fans began traveling to Forbes Field to watch the games. The radio soon became an essential tool for sports fans all over the world. When teams had home games, stores and shops would mount loudspeakers outside so listeners could experience the game on their own time.\nAs the radio developed throughout the 1920s, networks like CBS and NBC established its versatility by their ability to broadcast to an audience.\n1930s.\nThe majority of the leagues' teams were reluctant to the idea of broadcasting their games. They all feared that fans would rather listen to the game on the radio than go to the ballpark. The fear was so overpowering that radio broadcasting was within one or two votes from being permanently banned.\nThe first-ever televised baseball game aired on May 17, 1939, between Princeton and Columbia. Princeton beat Columbia 2–1 at Columbia's Baker Field. The game was aired on NBC station W2XBS. At the time, this was NBC's experimental station located in New York City, which would ultimately become WNBC. The game was announced by Bill Stern.\nOn August 26 of the same year, the first ever Major League Baseball game was televised once again on W2XBS. With Red Barber announcing, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds played a doubleheader at Ebbets Field. The Reds won the first game 5–2, while the Dodgers won the second game 6–1. Barber called the game without the benefit of a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was placed behind home plate, in the second tier of seating, while another was positioned near the visitors' dugout, on the third-base side.\nLater that year, Major League Baseball announced that all 16 major league teams were on the radio.\n1940s.\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, televised sports was something not many people were familiar with. At this time, the radio was still the main form of broadcasting baseball games. Many notable and famous broadcasters such as, Vin Scully, Red Barber, Harry Caray, Ernie Harwell, and Mel Allen.\nBy 1947, television sets were selling almost as fast as they could be produced. For this reason, Major League Baseball teams began televising games which attracted a whole new audience to the ballparks. Casual fans who only rarely followed baseball began going to the games in person and enjoyed themselves. As a result, Major League Baseball's attendance reached a record high of 21 million just a year later.\nIn 1947, The World Series was televised for the first time ever. The games were shown in on NBC over their WNBT channel (now WNBC). The broadcast was sponsored by Gillette and Ford. With only about 100,000 television sets in the country at the time, the 1947 World Series brought in an estimated 3.9 million viewers. Many fans watched the action unfold from bars and other public places. This soon became television's first mass audience.\nOn April 16, 1948, Chicago's WGN-TV (run by Jake Israel) broadcast its first big-league game. Jack Brickhouse called the Chicago White Sox' 4–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs in an exhibition game at Wrigley Field. WGN televised each Cubs and White Sox home game live. According to Brickhouse,\n1950s.\nOn July 11, 1950, the All-Star Game was televised for the first time from Chicago's Comiskey Park. On November 8, 1950, Commissioner Happy Chandler and player reps agreed on the split of the TV-radio rights from the World Series.\nOn August 11, 1951, WCBS-TV in New York City televised the first baseball game in color using its field-sequential color system. In this game, fans saw the Boston Braves beat the Brooklyn Dodgers by the score of 8–4.\nOn October 1 of that year, NBC aired the first coast-to-coast baseball telecast. The Brooklyn Dodgers were beaten 3-1 by the New York Giants in a tiebreaker game of a playoff series. It was in this game in which Giant's third baseman, Bobby Thomson hit his famous game-winning home run. This clutch home run would later be named the “Shot Heard ’Round the World”.\nNBC added another first in 1955, when they televised that year's World Series entirely in compatible electronic color. The Dodgers defeated the Yankees that season for their only championship while they were based in Brooklyn.\nIn 1958, KTTV in Los Angeles, California, aired the first regular-season baseball game ever played on the West Coast, a Los Angeles Dodgers-San Francisco Giants game from Seals Stadium in San Francisco, California, with Vin Scully announcing. In its first year airing Major League Baseball, KTTV aired only the Dodgers' road games.\nWhat may be the first sports instant replay using videotape occurred on July 17, 1959, during a broadcast of a New York Yankees game by New York TV station WPIX. It came after a hit by Jim McAnany of the Chicago White Sox ended a no-hitter by the Yankees' Ralph Terry. Since the game was being videotaped, broadcaster Mel Allen asked director Terry Murphy to play a tape of McAnany's hit over the air.\n1960s.\nOn July 23, 1962, Major League Baseball had its first satellite telecast (via Telstar Communications). The telecast included portion of a contest between the Chicago Cubs vs. the Philadelphia Phillies from Wrigley Field with Jack Brickhouse commentating.\nOn July 17, 1964, a game out of Los Angeles between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers became the first Pay TV baseball game. Basically, subscription television offered the \"cablecast\" to subscribers for money. The Dodgers beat the Cubs by the score of 3–2, with Don Drysdale collecting 10 strikeouts along the way.\nOn March 17, 1965, Jackie Robinson became the first black network (ABC) broadcaster for Major League Baseball. That year, ABC provided the first-ever nationwide baseball coverage with weekly Saturday broadcasts on a regional basis. Some time later, Bill White became the first black man to regularly do play-by-play work for Major League Baseball.\n1970s.\nOn October 13, 1971, the World Series held a night game for the first time. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who felt that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; TV ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number. In subsequent years, all weekday games would be played at night.\nExcept for Game 1 in both series, all League Championship Series games in 1975 were regionally televised. Meanwhile, Game 3 of both League Championship Series were aired in prime time, the first time such an occurrence happened.\nOn October 18, 1977, ABC's Bill White became the first African American broadcaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy at the conclusion of the World Series.\n1980s.\nIn 1985, NBC's telecast of the All-Star Game out of the Metrodome in Minnesota was the first program to be broadcast in stereo by a TV network. Also in 1985, ABC announced that every game of the World Series would be played under the lights for the biggest baseball audience possible. It marked the first time that all World Series games were played at night.\nIn 1989, NBC's Gayle Gardner became the first woman to regularly host Major League Baseball games for a major television network.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, CBS Sports' Lesley Visser became the first female to cover the World Series, serving as their lead field reporter. In addition to working the World Series from 1990-1993 for CBS, Visser covered the 1995 World Series for ABC Sports via The Baseball Network.\nOn August 3, 1993, Gayle Gardner became the first woman to do television play-by-play for a Major League Baseball game. It was the Colorado Rockies vs. Cincinnati Reds on KWGN-TV in Denver.\nAlso in 1993, CBS' Andrea Joyce became the first woman to co-host the network television coverage of the World Series. Joyce co-hosted that particular World Series with Pat O'Brien.\nOn October 2, 1995, ESPN televised the first tie-breaker playoff game on cable television. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan called the game from Seattle's Kingdome between the Seattle Mariners and California Angels.\nIn 1995, NBC's Hannah Storm not only became the first woman to serve as solo host a World Series game, but also the first woman to preside over the World Series Trophy presentation.\nIn 1996, ESPN began a five-year contract with Major League Baseball worth $440 million and about $80 million per year. ESPN paid for the rights to a Wednesday doubleheader and the Sunday night \"Game of the Week\", as well as all postseason games not aired on Fox or NBC. As a result, Major League Baseball postseason games were aired on cable for the very first time.\nOn July 8, 1997, Fox televised its first ever All-Star Game (out of Jacobs Field in Cleveland). For this particular game, Fox introduced \"Catcher-Cam\" in which a camera was affixed to catchers' masks in order to provide unique perspectives of the action around home plate. Catcher-Cam soon would become a regular fixture in Fox's baseball broadcasts.\nOn March 31, 1998, NBC affiliate KXAS presented the first non-experimental high-definition broadcast of a regular-season game, an Opening Day contest between the Chicago White Sox and the Texas Rangers. The White Sox prevailed that day, defeating the Rangers 8–1.\n2000s.\n2001 marked first year of split coverage of one League Championship Series game as well as the first cable involvement in LCS. Game 5 of the NLCS and Game 4 of the ALCS were split between the Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox Sports Net. 2001 also featured the first cable Division Series game to be aired in prime time.\nThe 2002 World Series, broadcast on Fox, was the first World Series to be broadcast in high-definition.\nWith TBS acquiring rights to air one half of the League Championship Series (the other half going to Fox), 2007 marked the first time that an LCS was broadcast exclusively on cable. It also marked the first time that cable television produced postseason games weren't available on over-the-air television in the participating teams' home markets.\nAlso in 2007, ESPN2 broadcast the Major League Baseball Draft. It was the first time the draft was televised.\n2009 marked the first time that Baseball Hall of Fame election ceremony was broadcast live, when MLB Network televised the occasion.\nAlso in 2009, New York Yankees broadcaster Suzyn Waldman became the first woman to work a World Series game from the broadcast booth.\n2010s.\nFor the first time ever, in 2010, the MLB season opener was televised live in China over five broadcasters reaching nearly 300 million fans. The game was played on April 4, 2010, between the Boston Red Sox and the reigning World Series champion New York Yankees.\nOn August 24, 2015, Jessica Mendoza was the first female analyst for a Major League Baseball game in the history of ESPN, during a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Arizona Diamondbacks. On August 30, 2015, Mendoza filled in for suspended color commentator Curt Schilling for the Cubs-Dodgers game on \"Sunday Night Baseball\". Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta pitched a no hitter in the game. John Kruk, Dan Shulman and Mendoza called the 2015 American League Wild Card Game on October 6, and Mendoza became the first female analyst in MLB postseason history.\n2020s.\nOn May 13, 2021, Major League Baseball extended their deal with ESPN through the year 2028. The agreement is set to begin at the start of the 2022 season. With this agreement, ESPN will televise 30 regular season games for the next 6 years. In addition, ESPN will also host the annual Home Run Derby and up to 10 spring training games. ESPN has been one of the MLB's biggest partners and it allows for a way for fans to see the biggest match ups of the year.\nOn July 20, 2021, Melanie Newman was the play-by-play announcer as part of the first all-female broadcast team, who called the Baltimore Orioles vs. Tampa Bay Rays game for YouTube.\nOn September 29, 2021, ESPN aired the first nationally televised Major League Baseball broadcast to be called entirely by women. Melanie Newman and Jessica Mendoza called the game in Los Angeles between the Dodgers and San Diego Padres."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLVII",
        "text": "Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. The Ravens defeated the 49ers by the score of 34–31, handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in their franchise history. The game was played on Sunday, February 3, 2013, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. This was the tenth Super Bowl to be played in New Orleans, equaling Miami's record of ten in an individual city. This was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since Super Bowl XXXVI and it was the first to be played there since Hurricane Katrina struck the city in 2005.\nFor the first time in Super Bowl history, the game featured two brothers coaching against each other — Jim and John Harbaugh, head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens, respectively — earning it the nickname Har-bowl. Jim's son and John's nephew, Jay Harbaugh, was also on the Ravens' coaching staff. Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games (Baltimore, 1–0; San Francisco, 5–0). The 49ers, who posted a regular-season record of 11–4–1, entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history (and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season), which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise. The Ravens, who posted a 10–6 regular-season record, made their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, having previously won Super Bowl XXXV. Linebacker Ray Lewis, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) from that game, as well as the last remaining member of the inaugural Ravens roster from 1996, also played in this game, his and 49ers wide receiver Randy Moss' last before both retired from professional football.\nBaltimore dominated the first half of the game, aided by quarterback Joe Flacco's three touchdown passes that gave the Ravens a 21–3 lead before their lead was cut to 21–6 just before halftime; the Ravens immediately resumed scoring after Jacoby Jones returned the second half kickoff a record 108 yards, increasing their lead to 28–6. However, a partial power outage in the Superdome following the return suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl). After play resumed, San Francisco began to rally, scoring 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead to 28–23. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers drove down to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the two-minute warning but turned the ball over on downs.\nThe Ravens then took an intentional safety in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Flacco, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, became the fourth consecutive quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP, after Drew Brees at Super Bowl XLIV, Aaron Rodgers at Super Bowl XLV, and Eli Manning at Super Bowl XLVI. \nCBS broadcast the game in the United States, and charged an average of $4 million for a 30-second commercial during the game, the highest rate for any Super Bowl. According to Nielsen, Super Bowl XLVII was viewed by an estimated average of 108.69 million people in the United States, with a record 164.1 million tuning into at least six minutes of the game. Beyoncé performed in the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, which featured a reunion with fellow Destiny's Child alumni Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.\nBackground.\nThe game marked the first Super Bowl in which both of the teams had appeared, but had not yet lost a previous Super Bowl; the 49ers came into the game having won all five of their previous Super Bowl appearances, while the Ravens had won in their lone previous Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. Currently, this phenomenon can only be repeated if either the Ravens or the New York Jets play against either the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or the New Orleans Saints in a subsequent Super Bowl. Baltimore's victory made them the only current NFL franchise to have appeared in at least two Super Bowls without ever losing any of their appearances; this feat was later equaled by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nHost-selection process.\nThree cities presented bids for the game:\nThe league then selected the New Orleans bid during the NFL's Spring Ownership Meetings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on May 19, 2009. This was the tenth time that the city has hosted the Super Bowl, by far the most by an individual city and once again tying with the Miami area for the most Super Bowls hosted by a metropolitan area. It was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since the Superdome sustained damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as since the naming rights of the Superdome were sold to Mercedes-Benz while it was undergoing a major renovation in 2011, including the addition of Champions Square. New Orleans artist Ally Burguieres was selected to design the official medallion for Super Bowl XLVII, which was included on beads to commemorate the Mardi Gras tradition.\nBecause of the February 3 date of Super Bowl XLVII, the 2013 Mardi Gras calendar in Orleans Parish was changed. Parades scheduled for February 3 and before were moved ahead one week. The same situation occurred in 2002 when the 9/11 attacks caused a one-week delay in the 2001 NFL season, resulting in the Super Bowl XXXVI falling within the Mardi Gras parade calendar.\nThis was the 49ers' second Super Bowl played at the Superdome—the first being Super Bowl XXIV when they beat the Denver Broncos 55–10. The 49ers, Broncos and New England Patriots are the only teams so far to play two or more Super Bowls at the Superdome. The 49ers also joined the Broncos and the Colts in playing two Super Bowls at two stadiums. The 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIX in Miami at what is now known as Hard Rock Stadium.\nNicknames.\nSuper Bowl XLVII earned many nicknames, including the \"Bro Bowl\", \"Har-Bowl\", \"HarBowl\", \"Super Baugh\", \"Brother Bowl\", and \"Superbro\", as this was the first Super Bowl featuring brothers as opposing head coaches: Baltimore's John Harbaugh and San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh, whose clubs previously met in a 2011 Thanksgiving Day game, which John Harbaugh's Ravens won 16–6, which was also the first time that two brothers had met as rival head coaches in the NFL. Due to a power outage affecting half the stadium during the third quarter, the game has also become known as the \"Blackout Bowl\".\nTeams.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nAfter going 12–4 and reaching the AFC Championship Game in 2011, only to lose to the New England Patriots when wide receiver Lee Evans dropped a game-winning catch in the end zone and Billy Cundiff missed a potential game-tying 32-yard field goal, the Ravens advanced further in 2012 to the Super Bowl after recording a 10–6 regular season record. Under head coach John Harbaugh, who was in his fifth season with the team, Baltimore upgraded their roster with players such as defensive backs Sean Considine and Corey Graham, and wide receiver Jacoby Jones. In December 2012, the Ravens fired offensive coordinator Cam Cameron and promoted quarterbacks coach Jim Caldwell, who was previously the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts from 2009 to 2011, as the successor. With personnel on both sides of the ball, they finished the season ranked 10th in points per game (24.9), and 12th in fewest points allowed (21.5)\nIn command of the offense was five-year veteran Joe Flacco, who finished the season with a career-high 3,817 passing yards and 22 touchdowns, with only 10 interceptions. (Super Bowl XLVII would be one of only two years the AFC team's quarterback would \"not\" be either Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger or Peyton Manning between Super Bowls XXXVI and LIII; the other was Super Bowl XXXVII ten years prior, when the 2002 Oakland Raiders were helmed by Rich Gannon.) His top targets were receivers Anquan Boldin (65 receptions, 921 yards, 4 touchdowns) and Torrey Smith (49 receptions, 855 yards, 8 touchdowns), along with tight end Dennis Pitta (61 receptions, 669 yards, 7 touchdowns). Their backfield featured two Pro Bowl selections: halfback Ray Rice and fullback Vonta Leach. Rice rushed for 1,143 yards and 9 touchdowns, while also hauling in 61 receptions for 478 yards and another score. Leach served effectively as his lead blocker and a receiver out of the backfield, catching 21 passes. The Ravens' offensive line was led by Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda, and 14-year veteran center Matt Birk.\nOn special teams, Jones returned 38 kickoffs for 1,116 yards and two touchdowns, giving him a whopping 30.7 yards per return average. He also gained 341 yards and another touchdown returning punts, and caught 30 passes for 406 yards and a score. Rookie kicker Justin Tucker ranked 7th in the NFL in field goal percentage (90.9), kicking 30/33 field goals and making all 42 of his extra point attempts.\nBaltimore's defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Haloti Ngata, who compiled 51 tackles and 5 sacks, along with defensive tackle Arthur Jones (47 tackles, 4.5 sacks). The Ravens also had an excellent set of linebackers, such as Paul Kruger, Dannell Ellerbe, Jameel McClain, Terrell Suggs, and Ray Lewis. Kruger led the team in sacks with 9, while Ellerbe added 92 tackles and 4.5 sacks. McClain had 79 tackles. Suggs, a ten-year veteran and five-time Pro Bowl selection, who had missed the first half of the regular season with a partially torn Achilles tendon, made a speedy recovery and was key in the Ravens' win over the Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs with 2 sacks on Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning. Lewis, a 17-year veteran and 13-time Pro Bowl selection, had missed most of the season with an arm injury, but still managed to rack up 57 tackles in just 6 games. Then shortly before returning for the playoffs, he announced his plans to retire after the postseason, and promptly went on to amass 44 tackles in Baltimore's four playoff games.\nThe Ravens secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Ed Reed, the NFL's all-time leader in interception return yardage. Reed had another statistically successful season in 2012, recording 58 tackles and 4 interceptions. Cornerback Cary Williams was also a big contributor with 4 interceptions and 75 tackles.\nThe team dedicated their 2012 season to former owner and founder Art Modell, who died on September 6, 2012, four days before the first regular season game.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nThe 49ers had recently emerged as a dominant team after nearly a decade of ineptitude. During the 1980s and 1990s, they had been one of the NFL top contenders, playing in ten conference championship games and winning five Super Bowls. But after a strong 2002 season, San Francisco went into a dismal slump in which they failed to make the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons. Following the end of the 2010 season, the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach. Harbaugh, who played 14 years in the NFL, joined the team after an impressive 12–1 season as the coach of Stanford, and in his first season with San Francisco he managed to turn their fortunes around, aided by breakout seasons from quarterback Alex Smith and receiver Michael Crabtree.\nSmith entered the 2012 season as the starting quarterback, but missed two starts mid-season after suffering a concussion, and second-year backup Colin Kaepernick successfully filled in. A quarterback controversy then began because Smith was ranked third in the NFL in passer rating (104.1), led the league in completion percentage (70%), and had been 19–5–1 as a starter under Harbaugh, while Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength. After Smith was fully recovered, Harbaugh chose Kaepernick as the starter for the 8–2–1 49ers, but also stated that the assignment was week-to-week and not necessarily permanent. Kaepernick ended up being the starter for the rest of the season and led the team to an 11–4–1 record, throwing for 1,814 yards and 10 touchdowns, with just 3 interceptions and a 98.4 passer rating, while also rushing for 415 yards and 5 touchdowns.\nSan Francisco's top receiver was Crabtree, who caught 85 passes for a career-high 1,105 yards and 9 touchdowns. Other key contributors to the passing game included tight end Vernon Davis (41 receptions for 538 yards and 5 touchdowns) along with offseason acquired receivers Mario Manningham and Randy Moss. Manningham had been signed away from the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants, while Moss, the NFL's second all-time leader in receiving yards, had been signed out of retirement after missing the previous season. The 49ers' backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Frank Gore, who rushed for 1,214 yards and 8 touchdowns, while also catching 28 passes for 234 yards and another score. The team also had a strong offensive line with two Pro Bowl linemen, left tackle Joe Staley and left guard Mike Iupati.\nOn special teams, punter Andy Lee led the NFL in net yards per punt (43.2) and ranked 5th in gross yards per punt (48.1). He planted 36 punts inside the 20-yard line with just 5 touchbacks. Kicker David Akers had a relatively bad year overall, converting only 69 percent of his field goal attempts, but in the week 1 contest against the Green Bay Packers tied the NFL record for the longest field goal with a successful 63-yard attempt. Receiver Ted Ginn Jr. returned 32 punts for 326 yards and 11 kickoffs for 253.\nThe 49ers' strongest unit was their defense, which ranked 2nd in fewest points allowed per game (17.1) and sent 6 of their 11 starters to the Pro Bowl. Pro Bowl defensive end Justin Smith led the line with 66 tackles and 3 sacks. Behind him, all four of the team's starting linebackers—Aldon Smith, NaVorro Bowman, Patrick Willis and Ahmad Brooks—were named to the 2012 All-Pro Team, and all but Brooks made the Pro Bowl. Aldon Smith set a franchise record with 19.5 sacks, more than the rest of the team had combined. Willis ranked second on the team with 120 tackles and picked off two passes, while Bowman's 149 tackles were second most in the NFL. The 49ers secondary featured Pro Bowl safeties Dashon Goldson and Donte Whitner.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Ravens finished the season as the AFC North champion and the number 4 seed in the AFC. The Ravens began their playoff run at home against the number 5 seed Indianapolis Colts in the Wild-Card round in what would turn out to be Ray Lewis's final career home game. The Ravens defeated the Colts 24–9, with Flacco throwing for 288 yards and two touchdowns, while their defense held the Colts to just 9 points, 13 below their regular season average.\nIn the divisional round, the Ravens would face the top-seeded Denver Broncos, who came into the game with an 11-game winning streak. The Ravens fell behind late in the game, but with less than a minute left on the clock, Flacco's 70-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones sent the game into overtime, a play that is known as the Mile High Miracle. An interception by Corey Graham from Peyton Manning late in the first overtime period set up Tucker's 47-yard field goal to win the game 1:42 into double overtime.\nFinally, the Ravens advanced to the Super Bowl by overcoming a 13-7 halftime deficit and then beating the second-seeded New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game 28–13, avenging the Ravens' loss against the Patriots in the 2011 AFC Championship Game, forcing three turnovers total, intercepting two of Tom Brady's passes, and keeping the Patriots scoreless in the second half. By winning the game, the Ravens handed Brady his first (and only) AFC Championship Game loss at home.\nAs the NFC West champion and the number 2 seed in the NFC, the 49ers earned a first-round bye. The 49ers started their playoff run against the number 3 seed Green Bay Packers in the divisional round. Jim Harbaugh's decision to start Kaepernick for the playoffs came into immediate question when he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Sam Shields on their opening drive, but this turned out to be the only miscue he would make for the rest of the game, as well as the only interception he would throw until the Super Bowl. By the end of the game, Kaepernick racked up 444 total yards (more than the entire Packers team), including 181 rushing yards, the NFL single game record for rushing yards by a quarterback, as the 49ers went on to win easily, 45–31.\nThe 49ers then faced the top-seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game, where they quickly fell behind 17–0 in the first half. No team in NFC Championship Game history had ever overcome a deficit that large, but the 49ers proved up to the challenge, cutting the score to 24–21 going into the final quarter. Late in the game, the 49ers' comeback hopes suffered a setback when Crabtree lost a fumble on the 1-yard line as he was going in for the leading score. However, the 49ers defense forced a punt, and Ted Ginn Jr.'s 20-yard return set up a touchdown run by Gore. The 49ers defense then held firm, forcing a turnover on downs at their 10-yard line to secure the victory.\nPregame notes.\nThis was the first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXXVII ten years prior that did not feature the New England Patriots, Indianapolis Colts, or the Pittsburgh Steelers as the AFC representatives, and the only Super Bowl between 2003 and 2019 not to feature Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger or Peyton Manning. Baltimore defeated the Colts and Patriots during the playoffs while the Steelers failed to make the playoffs. By contrast, the NFC had a different member go to the Super Bowl almost every year during that same span, with the New York Giants (who won Super Bowls XLII and XLVI) being the only NFC team to make two appearances during that span. With the 49ers making their first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl XXIX, this left the Dallas Cowboys (last appeared in Super Bowl XXX), Detroit Lions (never appeared in a Super Bowl), Minnesota Vikings (last appeared in Super Bowl XI) and Washington Redskins (last appeared in Super Bowl XXVI) as the only NFC teams not to play in a Super Bowl since 1998, with only the Vikings (on three occasions) and the lions (in 2024) even advancing to the NFC Championship Game. \nThis was the sixth time in seven seasons in which one of the participants advanced to the Super Bowl after not having a first-round bye in the Wild Card playoffs, and was the last time to occur under the twelve team playoff structure.\nThe 49ers attempted to follow the 2012 World Series championship victory of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants. The last time a metropolitan area won the World Series and Super Bowl in the same season was when the Boston Red Sox won the 2004 World Series followed by the Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXIX (and the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVIII earlier in 2004).\nAs the 49ers – who were attempting to join the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers as the only teams to win a Super Bowl in three decades – were the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, San Francisco elected to wear their red jerseys, which they wore in Super Bowls XIX, XXIII, and XXIX (wearing an alternate throwback red jersey with three-dimensional numerals in XXIX), and gold pants (worn in their first four Super Bowl appearances) for the first time since Super Bowl XXIV (having worn white pants in XXIX along with the aforementioned throwback jerseys). The Ravens wore white jerseys as they did in Super Bowl XXXV, but with black-colored pants this time instead of white. Due to the Ravens having their Art Modell memorial patch on the left side of their jerseys, the team wore their Super Bowl XLVII patch on the right side.\nMuch of the pregame media hype centered around the Harbaugh brothers, and how their father Jack, a former college football head coach, raised them. On January 24, Jack, along with his wife Jackie and daughter Joani, conducted a media conference call, answering questions about John and Jim. Jackie jokingly asked if the game could end in a tie, before stating that the family was staying neutral but remain excited that both John and Jim brought their respective teams to the Super Bowl. The Harbaugh brothers then conducted a joint press conference on the Friday before the game, which is unusual for opposing Super Bowl coaches, but it was done because of the historic nature of the game.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nThe game was carried by CBS in the United States, with Jim Nantz calling play-by-play and Phil Simms as color analyst. Steve Tasker and Solomon Wilcots served as sideline reporters. The pregame show, \"The Super Bowl Today\", was hosted by James Brown and featuring analysts Dan Marino, Boomer Esiason, Shannon Sharpe and Bill Cowher.\nA special episode of \"Elementary\" would be the lead-out program of this Super Bowl.\nThe game was later featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" under the title \"Change of Momentum\".\nAdvertising.\nAccording to CBS, the price of a 30-second advertisement hit a record high US $4,000,000. General Motors announced it would not advertise on the game, citing the advertising costs.\nAdbowl had a special theme this year for the Super Bowl, called \"Catbowl 2013\", which pitted the best commercials by votes with cat videos to see which one is more popular.\nThe advertisers for Super Bowl XLVII included Mercedes-Benz, Gildan, Samsung, BlackBerry, Kraft Foods, Subway, Taco Bell, Procter &amp; Gamble, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, Sodastream, PepsiCo (including entries in the Doritos Crash the Super Bowl contest), Axe, Audi, Kia Motors, Ford Motor Company, Wonderful Pistachios, GoDaddy, and perpetual Super Bowl advertiser Anheuser-Busch. Ram Trucks and the Future Farmers of America ran a two-minute commercial based on the Paul Harvey speech \"So God Made a Farmer.\" Movie studios Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paying for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. With Paramount paying for \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" and \"World War Z\", Universal paying for the debut trailer for \"Fast &amp; Furious 6\" that followed \"Monsters vs. Aliens\"' footsteps and Disney paying for \"Iron Man 3\", \"The Lone Ranger\" and \"Oz the Great and Powerful\".\nInternational.\nAn international feed designed for areas less familiar with American football was produced by NFL Network, with Bob Papa (the regular-season voice of the New York Giants) calling play-by-play and Joe Theismann as color analyst. The NFL claimed that this feed would go to 180 countries.\nStreaming.\nFor the second consecutive year, a webcast of the broadcast was provided, this time on CBSSports.com.\nRadio.\nIn the United States, the game was carried nationwide over the Dial Global radio network, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason as color analyst, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Univision Radio broadcast the game in Spanish.\nEach team's flagship station also carried the game: WIYY and WBAL broadcast the game in Baltimore, with Gerry Sandusky on play-by-play and Stan White and Qadry Ismail on color commentary. In San Francisco, the game was broadcast on KSAN-FM and KNBR, with Ted Robinson on play-by-play, Eric Davis on color commentary, and Rod Brooks reporting from the sidelines. Both WBAL and KNBR are clear-channel stations, which allowed the local commentaries to be heard throughout the Eastern and Western United States, respectively. Per contractual rules, the rest of the stations in the 49ers' and Ravens' radio networks carried the Dial Global feed.\nInternationally, the game was carried on radio as follows:\nSirius XM Radio and NFL Audio Pass carried the local, Dial Global, and select international audio feeds.\nEntertainment.\nPregame.\nOn January 18, 2013, the league announced that Alicia Keys would sing the national anthem. Keys stated that she would not perform the song traditionally and instead would perform it as if it were \"a brand new song.\"\nSinger Jennifer Hudson and a chorus of several students from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, performed \"America the Beautiful\" as a tribute to the 26 students and staff who were murdered at the school the previous year.\nThere was also a pregame performance by the world renowned “Human Jukebox” from Southern University. \nThe coin toss ceremony featured the recent inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Larry Allen, Cris Carter, Curley Culp, Warren Sapp, Bill Parcells, Jonathan Ogden, and Dave Robinson.\nHalftime.\nOn October 16, 2012, Beyoncé was chosen as the headline performer for the Super Bowl halftime show, with a reunited Destiny's Child also appearing as part of the show.\nDespite initial reports that mentioned Beyoncé's husband, Jay Z, was a potential collaborator on the show, he did not make an appearance.\nBeyoncé's performance had an estimated 104 million viewers.\nGame summary.\nFirst quarter.\nSan Francisco was hurt by penalties and turnovers early in the game as the Ravens built a 21–6 first-half lead. On their first play of the opening drive, tight end Vernon Davis's 20-yard reception was called back by an illegal formation penalty. The team ended up punting after three more plays, and Jacoby Jones returned the ball 17 yards to the Ravens' 49-yard line. Baltimore then drove 51 yards, scoring on Joe Flacco's 13-yard touchdown pass to receiver Anquan Boldin. Flacco had previously thrown a third-down incompletion, but an offsides penalty against linebacker Ahmad Brooks gave him a second chance.\nSan Francisco responded on their next possession, moving the ball 62 yards in a 12-play drive, with quarterback Colin Kaepernick completing a 19-yard pass to Michael Crabtree and a 24-yarder to Davis. David Akers finished the drive with a 36-yard field goal to cut the score to 7–3. Baltimore responded with a drive to the 49ers' 37-yard line, featuring a 30-yard catch by Boldin, but came up empty after Flacco was sacked on third down for a 5-yard loss by defensive tackle Ray McDonald, pushing the Ravens out of field goal range.\nSecond quarter.\nFive plays into the 49ers' next drive, linebacker Courtney Upshaw forced a fumble from running back LaMichael James, and Baltimore's Arthur Jones recovered it on the Ravens' 25-yard line. Baltimore drove 75 yards on 10 plays, 52 of those came from a 23-yard and a 14-yard pass to tight end Ed Dickson, the second followed by a 15-yard facemask penalty on Donte Whitner. Dennis Pitta caught a 1-yard touchdown catch on the final play of the drive and the extra point made the score 14–3.\nOn the first play of the next drive, Ed Reed intercepted a pass by Kaepernick and returned the ball 6 yards to the 49ers' 38-yard line. This was the first interception thrown by San Francisco in any of their six Super Bowl appearances. Unnecessary roughness charges were called after the play on players from both teams so the charges offset. Baltimore reached the red zone on their next drive, but was unable to score. Following a one yard run by Bernard Pierce and two incomplete passes, rookie kicker Justin Tucker was tackled 1 yard short of a first down while running the ball on a fake field goal play.\nSan Francisco was forced to a three-and-out on the drive. Jones muffed the punt, but recovered the ball and returned it 11 yards to the Ravens' 44-yard line. Two plays later, Jones made a falling catch deep down the field, then got back up and eluded two 49ers defensive backs in route to a 56-yard touchdown reception, making the score 21–3 with less than two minutes to go in the first half. On the second play of San Francisco's next drive, tight end Delanie Walker caught a 14-yard pass from Kaepernick, which was extended by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Haloti Ngata. After an incomplete first down attempt, Walker received another 28-yard pass, putting San Francisco on the Baltimore 17-yard line. San Francisco reached the 9-yard line, but were unable to convert on three plays. On the last play of the half, Akers kicked his second field goal to cut their deficit to 21–6.\nThird quarter.\nOn the second-half kickoff, Jacoby Jones fielded the kick and promptly returned it 108 yards for the longest play in Super Bowl history. It broke the previous 104-yard record for the longest kickoff return in the playoffs (set by Trindon Holliday of the Denver Broncos in the divisional playoff game earlier that year against Baltimore), and it tied an NFL record already held by Jones and shared with Ellis Hobbs and Randall Cobb for the longest kickoff return. With the extra point, Baltimore was now leading 28–6.\nShortly into the 49ers' next drive, a power outage caused the lights to go out in half of the stadium, stopping play for 34 minutes. The outage was caused by equipment failure at the stadium. \nAfter play resumed, both teams punted once. Then San Francisco drove 80 yards, with Kaepernick rushing for 15 yards and completing an 18-yard pass to Davis before finishing the drive with a pass to Crabtree, who broke through two potential Ravens tacklers on the way to a 31-yard touchdown reception. Then Baltimore was forced to punt from their own 9-yard line following Brooks' 8-yard sack of Flacco on third down, and Ted Ginn Jr. returned the ball 32 yards to the 20 before being shoved out of bounds by punter Sam Koch. Kaepernick completed a 14-yard pass to Davis on the next play, and Gore followed it up with a 6-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 28–20.\nOn the second play of the fourth quarter, Baltimore committed their first turnover when defensive back Tarell Brown forced and recovered a fumble from Ray Rice on the Ravens' 25-yard line. Three plays later, Akers missed (went wide left) on a 39-yard field goal attempt, but Baltimore's Chykie Brown was penalized for running into the kicker, and Akers' second attempt was good from 34 yards, trimming the lead to 28–23.\nFourth quarter.\nThe Ravens responded on their ensuing possession, moving the ball 77 yards and advancing to the San Francisco 1-yard line, with Boldin catching two passes for 39 yards. But they were unable to reach the end zone and settled for Tucker's 19-yard field goal to put them back up by 8 points, 31–23. San Francisco stormed back, scoring in just five plays. Following a 32-yard reception by Randy Moss and a 21-yard burst by Gore, Kaepernick took the ball across the goal line on a 15-yard run, the longest touchdown run by a quarterback in Super Bowl history. However, the ensuing two-point conversion failed, so the 49ers were unable to break the deficit, still trailing at 31–29.\nOn the Ravens' ensuing drive, Boldin caught two passes for 22 yards and Rice rushed for 11 yards as the team moved the ball 55 yards and scored on Tucker's 38-yard field goal, making the score 34–29 with 4:19 left in regulation. San Francisco used up two timeouts on their next drive, but managed to move the ball to a first and goal on the Ravens' 7-yard line following a 24-yard catch by Crabtree and a 33-yard run by Gore.\nWith four chances to take the lead, San Francisco started out with a 2-yard run by James to the 5-yard line. Then Kaepernick threw two incompletions, bringing up fourth down. On their last chance, Kaepernick tried to throw the ball to Crabtree in the end zone, but it was too far ahead and the pass fell incomplete. Defensive back Jimmy Smith and Crabtree both made contact prior to the ball arriving, but no penalty was called and the 49ers turned the ball over on downs with 1:46 left in the game.\nSan Francisco managed to force a three-and-out on the Ravens' next drive, but as they had only one timeout remaining, the Ravens were able to run the clock down to twelve seconds. On fourth down, and after the Ravens then called a timeout of their own, punter Sam Koch fielded the snap in his own end zone. In an effort to kill as much of the twelve remaining seconds on the clock, Koch was instructed not to punt the ball but rather hang on to it and scramble around in the end zone. Koch was able to scramble for eight seconds before giving up an intentional safety by running out of the side of the end zone, leaving just four seconds remaining and giving the 49ers one more chance for a game-winning play. On the ensuing free kick, Ginn returned the ball 31 yards, but was tackled at midfield by linebacker Josh Bynes as time expired.\nPower outage.\nPlay was interrupted for 34 minutes because of a 22-minute partial power outage. The power failed with 13:22 remaining in the third quarter with the Ravens leading 28–6. Emergency generators provided backup lighting. The New Orleans Fire Department rescued people from elevator seven, but other elevators were brought to the ground uneventfully. Attendees used double the usual amount of data for their cell phones. AT&amp;T reported 78 gigabytes (GB) downloaded from 8 to 9 PM, about double from the peak the year before. NFL chief security officer Jeffrey Miller attributed fans' calmness to their preoccupation with their electronics.\nSMG, the Superdome's management company, had recently upgraded electrical systems at the facility. In an October 15, 2012, memo, Louisiana officials expressed concern that the equipment bringing electricity into the stadium from utility company Entergy had a \"chance of failure\". Authorities subsequently spent nearly $1 million on upgrades to the stadium, more than half of that paid to Allstar Electric to upgrade electrical feeder cables.\nEntergy and SMG both said the problem was in interconnection equipment, and SMG hired a third party to investigate. Investigations homed in on a newly installed switchgear. Entergy installed a pair of relays made by Rogers Park's S&amp;C Electric Company of Rogers Park, Chicago to ensure continued power supply in case one supply line failed. One of those relays tripped. Subsequent tests showed one of the relays functioned properly and the other did not. S&amp;C Electric Co. claims the relay's trip setting was too low, but Entergy claims that the two were set identically.\nElectricity usage during the game was on par with a regular New Orleans Saints game. The halftime show was powered by a generator that did not impact the stadium's power.\nCBS-TV viewers were shown the half-lit Superdome interior. The main broadcast booth was off line; sideline reporter Steve Tasker informed the audience that \"a click of the lights\" had occurred and play had been halted. Ray Lewis later stated in an interview that he believed the blackout was part of a conspiracy, saying \"You're a zillion dollar company and your lights go out? No. No way.\" 49ers CEO Jed York responded to the claim on Twitter in jest, tweeting \"There is no conspiracy. I pulled the plug.\"\nStatistical overview.\nThe teams combined for a Super Bowl-record 312 kickoff return yards. The Ravens scored the same number of points (34) in both of their Super Bowl appearances. Meanwhile, the 49ers became just the second team to lose the Super Bowl while scoring more than 30 points (joining the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII; the New England Patriots would join this list in Super Bowl LII, and so would Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII).\nFor the Ravens, Anquan Boldin was the leading receiver with 6 receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown. Paul Kruger had three tackles and two sacks, while Ed Reed had five tackles and an interception. Reed's interception gave him 9 career postseason picks, tying the NFL record. Dannell Ellerbe had nine tackles, while Ray Lewis had seven tackles in the final game of his 17-season career.\nBaltimore's Jacoby Jones returned 5 kickoffs for 208 yards and a touchdown, two punts for 28 yards, and caught a 56-yard touchdown pass. He tied an NFL league record and set a Super Bowl record for longest kickoff return in a Super Bowl with a 108-yard return to open up the second half. Jones also set or tied the following records: the record for most combined yards in a Super Bowl game with 290, tied the record for most touchdown plays of 50 yards or more, with 2 and became the first player to score a receiving touchdown and return touchdown in a Super Bowl.\nFor San Francisco, Colin Kaepernick completed 16 of 28 passes for 302 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 62 yards and another score, but had 1 interception. His 62 rushing yards were the second highest total by a quarterback in the Super Bowl, behind Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair's record of 64 in Super Bowl XXXIV. Kaepernick also set a Super Bowl record for the longest rushing touchdown from a quarterback for his 15-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. This beat the previous 6-yard record held by the 49ers' Joe Montana achieved in Super Bowl XIX.\nFrank Gore rushed for 110 yards and a touchdown. Michael Crabtree caught 5 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown, while Davis caught 6 passes for 104 yards. His 104 receiving yards tied Dan Ross's record for the most ever by a tight end in a Super Bowl. Patrick Willis was the top tackler of the game with 10, while Brooks had five tackles and a sack.\nBecause of the power outage in the third quarter, the game set a Super Bowl record long running time of 4 hours and 14 minutes. During the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Hall of Fame defensive end Richard Dent brought the trophy to the stage. Twitter announced that a record 24.1 million tweets were sent the night of the game.\nFinal statistics.\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl XLVII, The Football Database Super Bowl XLVII\nIndividual leaders.\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\nStarting lineups.\nSource:\nOfficials.\nOfficials wore the full-length black pants, introduced for cold weather in 2006, for the first time in a Super Bowl.

        "title": "Biathlon at the 2006 Winter Olympics – Men's individual",
        "text": "The Men's 20 kilometre individual biathlon competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy was held on 11 February, at Cesana San Sicario.\nThe individual race consisted of five laps around a four kilometre loop with four stops at the shooting range. During each shooting section, each biathlete fired five shots at five targets. Misses resulted in penalties of one minute per miss being added to the time for the course. The first and third shooting sections were conducted in the prone position, while the second and fourth were done standing. A total of 88 biathletes competed, starting with a staggered start and 30 seconds behind each competitor.\nMichael Greis of Germany hit 19 of the 20 targets and used a net time of 54:23.0 (with one penalty minute) to clinch the gold medal, 16 seconds ahead of Norway's Ole Einar Bjørndalen. Norway also won the bronze medal, with Halvard Hanevold beating Sergei Tchepikov by 0.8 seconds despite two penalty minutes to the Russian's one.\nThe previous year's trial World Cup event at this track saw Michael Greis of Germany win the event in a time of 53:18.7. At the 2005 World Championships in Hochfilzen, Austria, the Czech Roman Dostál won, while Ole Einar Bjørndalen was the defending Olympic champion, as he was in all the other men's events (except the mass start, which is held for the first time at the Olympics). However, neither Bjørndalen (9th) nor Dostal (33rd) headed the men's individual World Cup standings—the German Michael Greis did.\nThe event started with early starters Ricco Groß (Germany, started as number 4) and Pavel Rostovtsev (Russia, 1) shooting well, missing one and two of their 20 shots respectively; Groß suffered his missed shot on the last of the four shootings. However, their cross-country times were not good enough, as Rene Vuillermoz (Italy, 13) beat Groß by 14 seconds on the first loop. With only one miss in his first 15 shots, Vuillermoz could have taken the lead if he had hit all five targets on the final shooting. However, he missed three times and eventually finished 25th. Maxim Tchoudov (Russia, 14) led after two loops, 28 seconds ahead of Groß, but had spoiled his chance with three missed shots. By that time, many of the best skiers had started, with Greis (38) coming into the third shooting after one miss on the second. He hit five targets, and went out in the second best time, 12 seconds behind Marek Matiasko (Slovakia, 21), who was yet to miss a shot. Meanwhile, the defending champion Bjørndalen (54) had missed once on each of the first two shootings, and when all had passed the second loop he was 15th.\nHowever, Bjørndalen completed the third loop quickly, and with five hits he cut Greis' lead from 39 to 23 seconds just before Greis was to shoot his fourth shooting. Greis did not miss, and with the leader Matiasko conceding one penalty minute, Greis took the lead nearly a minute ahead of second-placed Julien Robert (France, 35), who had not missed a single shot. Some other late starters visited the top ten after the first loops, such as Sven Fischer (Germany, 63) and Zdeněk Vítek (Czech Republic, 67) but vanished, and there were only four others who could beat Greis' skiing speed. Except for Bjørndalen, all of the previous had started before him, but missed too many shots to compete; however, Bjørndalen had caught 37 seconds on the first 12 km, and needed a further 23. Thus, Bjørndalen was the only threat, and though Bjørndalen hit all five targets on the final shooting, he struggled with loading the rifle before the final shot. He later said he lost \"7-8 seconds\" on the error. Thus, Bjørndalen did not beat the German in the fourth loop, and though he cut a further seven seconds off Greis' time in the final loop, it was only enough to take the silver. The late starting Halvard Hanevold (Norway, 74), shot down the last 10 targets to jump from 28th place after two loops to a fourth place after the fourth, with third-placed Robert eight seconds ahead with two penalty minutes less. Hanevold had no problems with catching Robert on the final lap, ending nearly half a minute ahead, but lost seconds to Sergei Tchepikov (Russia, 28), who improved all the way through the course. Eventually, his 6.3-second lead after the fourth loop turned into 0.8 seconds in goal; it was enough, though, and Hanevold could celebrate his second Olympic medal on the individual event. Jay Hakkinen become the first American to finish in the Top 10 ever in the Winter Olympic biathlon with his 10th-place finish.\nResults.\nOne Austrian athlete was disqualified after the IOC determined they had violated the Anti-Doping rules; Wolfgang Perner had originally placed 60th.\nThe race was held at 13:00."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLVIII",
        "text": "Super Bowl XLVIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos and National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2013 season. The Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43–8, the largest margin of victory for an underdog and tied for the third largest point differential overall (35) in Super Bowl history with Super Bowl XXVII (1993). It was the first time the winning team scored over 40 points while holding their opponent to under 10. This became the first Super Bowl victory for the Seahawks and the fifth Super Bowl loss for the Broncos, at the time a league record (it would later be tied by the New England Patriots following their Super Bowl LII loss) for the most of any team. The game was played on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city and the first Super Bowl to be played on February 2.\nThe Seahawks posted a 13–3 record and were making their second Super Bowl appearance in nine years. The Broncos were making their seventh Super Bowl appearance after also posting a 13–3 record. This marked one of the few times that two former divisional rivals met in a Super Bowl, as the Seahawks and Broncos were in the same division (the AFC West) from 1977 to 2001.\nSeattle led 22–0 at halftime and ultimately went up 36–0 before allowing Denver's first and only score on the final play of the third quarter. The 36–0 lead was by far the largest shutout lead in Super Bowl history; the previous record was 24–0, shared by the Miami Dolphins over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII and the Washington Redskins over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVI. Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril scored a safety on the first play from scrimmage. They became the first team in a Super Bowl to score on a safety (12 seconds into the start of the game which set the record for the quickest score), a kickoff return for a touchdown (12 seconds into the second half), and an interception return for a touchdown. The Broncos were held to almost 30 points below their scoring average. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, a five-time NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, threw two interceptions in the first half. Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith, who returned one of those interceptions 69 yards for a touchdown, recovered a fumble and made nine tackles, was named Super Bowl MVP. This is the fifth Super Bowl where the winning team outscored the losing team in every quarter.\nIn the United States, the game was televised by Fox; with an average audience of 111.5 million viewers that peaked at 115.3 million during the halftime show featuring Bruno Mars. The game was briefly the most-watched U.S. television broadcast of all time, until it was surpassed by Super Bowl XLIX the following year. The game's inaugural Spanish-language telecast on Fox Deportes was also the highest-rated Spanish-language cable telecast outside of soccer. Seattle also tied the 1992 Dallas Cowboys for the third-largest blowout in Super Bowl history, behind Super Bowl XXIV in 1990, a 55–10 San Francisco 49ers victory over the Denver Broncos, and Super Bowl XX in 1986, a 46–10 Chicago Bears victory over the New England Patriots. This was also the first time since 1991 that the #1 scoring offense (Broncos) went up against the #1 scoring defense (Seahawks). \nBecause the game was one-sided from start to finish, Super Bowl XLVIII is widely regarded as one of the most disappointing Super Bowl games of all time, although it is also viewed as a crowning achievement of the Seahawks’ 2013 defense.\nBackground.\nPrevious plans for a Super Bowl in the New York City area.\nEfforts to see the New York City area host a Super Bowl predate MetLife Stadium's planning.\n \nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., those metro areas' business communities separately discussed seeking to host a future Super Bowl. The general thought was that either of these cities being the location of a Super Bowl would symbolize national recovery in the aftermath of the attacks. There was belief that if New York were awarded a Super Bowl (either building a new stadium or renovated the existing Giants Stadium to be the host venue), it might assist the city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in the same vein that awarding Super Bowl XXVIII to the city of Atlanta may have assisted the prospects of Atlanta's ultimately successful bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nBoth New York City and Washington, D.C. were, at one point, seen as likely to bid in 2003 for either 2008's Super Bowl XLII or 2009's Super Bowl XLIII. However, the prospect of the New York City region hosting a Super Bowl proved challenging due not only to the non-ideal cold weather climate, but also due to the difficulty in delivering an appropriate host venue. The city of New York and the New York Jets failed to secure a deal to build a new West Side Stadium in Manhattan (which, according to the initial plans, would have been built with a roof). Proposed renovations to the aging Giants Stadium were still subject to dispute between stakeholders. Giants Stadium lacked a roof, as did the city's two Major League Baseball stadiums. The lack of a venue with a roof was also seen as an obstacle due to the NFL having never played an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold weather climate.\nNew York City ultimately bid in 2005 for a Super Bowl. The NFL voted on March 23, 2005, to award New York City the rights to host 2010's Super Bowl XLIV, contingent on the proposed West Side Stadium (the planned site of the game) being completed by 2008. In August 2005, after New York state government officials declined to approve $400 million for the stadium, the NFL decided to revoke New York City's hosting rights, and reopen the bidding for the game's site.\nHost selection process.\nThree stadiums were part of the bidding to host the game:\nTampa had hosted four Super Bowls (XVIII, XXV, XXXV and XLIII), while South Florida / Miami had hosted ten Super Bowls (II, III, V, X, XIII, XXIII, XXIX, XXXIII, XLI and XLIV).\nDuring the voting process by the league owners, the South Florida/Miami bid was eliminated in the second round of voting, but it eventually took the fourth round of voting for New Jersey's bid to beat Tampa's. The game was awarded on May 26, 2010, at the NFL owners meetings in Irving, Texas.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII was the first Super Bowl held at an open-air stadium in a \"cold-weather\" city; previous Super Bowls in cold-weather cities were held at indoor stadiums. However, the temperature at kickoff was a mild , making this only the third-coldest Super Bowl. A major snow storm hit the area the very next day. According to Weather.com, the average high and low temperatures for East Rutherford on February 2 were and , respectively. The coldest outdoor Super Bowl of the first 47 games was Super Bowl VI, held at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans on January 16, 1972, with a kickoff temperature of (Tulane Stadium also hosted the second coldest outdoor Super Bowl, Super Bowl IX, with a kickoff temperature of ). However, New Orleans usually has a humid subtropical climate, with January morning lows averaging around and daily highs around ; also, all New Orleans Super Bowls since XII have been played at the indoor Superdome. Since Super Bowl X in 1976, all but one outdoor Super Bowl has been played in either California or Florida, the exception being Super Bowl XXX in Tempe, Arizona. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell indicated that if Super Bowl XLVIII was successful, additional \"cold-weather\" Super Bowls would be considered.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII was the first NFL championship game to be held in the New York metropolitan area since December 30, 1962, when the Green Bay Packers beat the New York Giants in the original Yankee Stadium, 16–7. Since then, two other major pro football leagues have held title games in the area:\nMetLife Stadium was the first Super Bowl venue that was simultaneously home to two NFL teams: the New York Giants and the New York Jets, and thus was the first championship game to have two host teams. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (which hosted Super Bowls I and VII) served as the home of the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Raiders, but not at the same time.\nThis was also the first Super Bowl played outdoors on artificial turf (FieldTurf) since Super Bowl X (1976) at the Miami Orange Bowl. It was also the first in which two U.S. states, New York and New Jersey, shared hosting duties. This was also the first Super Bowl to be played outdoors since Super Bowl XLIV was played in Miami Gardens.\nWinter outlook and contingency plans.\nThe choice of holding the Super Bowl outdoors in a cold weather environment generated some controversy. When it was released in August 2013, the \"Winter Outlook\" section in the 2014 \"Farmers' Almanac\" predicted that a winter storm would hit just about the time Super Bowl XLVIII kicked off; this generated the attention of several media sources, including ESPN's Rick Reilly in a piece that aired on ESPN's \"Monday Night Countdown\" on October 21, 2013. In a radio interview broadcast on WFAN, Fox studio analyst Terry Bradshaw stated that he opposes the idea of a cold Super Bowl, stating \"I don't want it to be bad ... What if we get two passing teams?\" In a piece published on \"Sports Illustrated\"'s \"Monday Morning Quarterback\" site, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman also opposed holding the game at MetLife Stadium, stating that \"it's the league's responsibility to show its audience the best possible product, and this can't happen in the snow.\" The decision to play the game in New Jersey was made even more controversial by the fact that the NFL informed the Miami Dolphins that Sun Life Stadium would never host another Super Bowl until they put a roof over the stadium for fear of rain.\nThe NFL announced on December 18, 2013, that in the event of a forecast of heavy snow, the game would be rescheduled for the Saturday before, or for the Monday or Tuesday after.\nOne day before the Super Bowl, weather conditions for the game were forecast to be mostly cloudy with temperatures in the low to mid-40s Fahrenheit.\nA winter storm arrived 6 hours after the game ended, dropping of snow on the region. The inclement weather canceled a quarter of the flights available at the area's three major airports, stranding thousands.\nNicknames.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII earned a few unofficial nicknames, with the \"Weed Bowl\", \"Bong Bowl\", and \"Marijuana Bowl\" being among the most prominent, from users of social networking websites and various news outlets as the home states of the Seahawks and Broncos (Washington and Colorado, respectively) were the first two states to legalize marijuana for recreational use, during the fall 2012 elections.\nTeams.\nThe Broncos and Seahawks were divisional AFC West rivals from 1977 until 2001, when the Seahawks moved to the NFC West. Their matchup in Super Bowl XLVIII marked the first time former in-division rivals met in the Super Bowl since Super Bowl XLIII.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nSeattle finished the season 13–3, winning the NFC West division and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The team scored 417 points during the season, while giving up 231.\nThe offense was led by second-year quarterback Russell Wilson, a third-round draft pick who won the starting role after a three-way quarterback competition in training camp and went on to win a playoff game in his rookie season with the Seahawks. In his second season, he completed 63.1 percent of his passes for 3,357 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only nine interceptions, while also rushing for 539 yards and another score. His 101.2 passer rating ranked him seventh in the NFL, and made him the first quarterback in history with a triple-digit passer rating in his first two seasons. His top target was Pro Bowl receiver Golden Tate, who caught 64 passes for 898 yards and five touchdowns. Tate was also a major asset on special teams, returning 51 punts for 585 yards (second in the NFL). Other key targets included Doug Baldwin (50 receptions, 775 yards, five touchdowns) and tight end Zach Miller (33 receptions, 387 yards, five touchdowns). Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch was the team's leading rusher with 1,257 yards and 12 touchdowns. He was also a reliable receiver, hauling in 36 passes for 316 yards and two more scores. The Seahawks' offensive line was led by Pro Bowl center Max Unger. Kicker Steven Hauschka ranked fourth in the NFL in scoring (143 points) and second in field goal percentage (.943, 33/35).\nSeattle had the NFL's top defense, with the fewest yards allowed per game (273.6), fewest points allowed (231) and most takeaways (39). They were the first team since the 1985 Chicago Bears to lead the league in all three categories. The Seahawks were also the fourth team to lead the NFL in interceptions and fewest passing yards allowed; all four teams reached the Super Bowl. Seattle's defensive line featured defensive ends Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett, both of whom recorded eight sacks. Avril also forced five fumbles, while Bennett recovered three, returning them for 39 yards and a touchdown. Defensive tackle Clinton McDonald also made a big impact with 5.5 sacks, two fumble recoveries and an interception. Linebacker Bobby Wagner led the team in combined tackles (120), while also racking up five sacks and two interceptions. But the best aspect of the defense was their secondary – collectively known as the Legion of Boom – which sent three of their four starters to the Pro Bowl: cornerback Richard Sherman, who led the NFL in interceptions (eight, with 125 return yards), along with free safety Earl Thomas (five interceptions, 105 tackles, two forced fumbles) and strong safety Kam Chancellor (99 tackles, three interceptions, 78 return yards).\nDenver Broncos.\nDenver finished the season 13–3 for the second straight year, winning the AFC West division and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Broncos had the best offense in the NFL, leading the league in points scored (606, the highest total in NFL history) and yards gained (7,313). The offense was so explosive that they scored points on their opening possession at least eight straight games leading into the playoffs and a ninth time against the San Diego Chargers during the Divisional Playoffs game. During the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots, they broke that streak, only to score on the opening possession of the second half. In only five out of 18 games (including playoffs) did they score fewer than 30 points, the fewest being 20 points.\nIn command of the offense was 16-year veteran quarterback Peyton Manning. Now in his second year as the team's starter, Manning posted one of the best seasons of any quarterback in NFL history (and the best season of his entire career), leading the league in completions, attempts, yards and touchdown passes. His 5,477 passing yards and 55 touchdown completions both set new NFL records. His total of 450 completions was the second-highest in NFL history, and his 115.1 passer rating ranked second in the league that season. Denver's leading pass-catcher was Pro Bowl receiver Demaryius Thomas, who caught 92 passes for 1,430 yards and 14 touchdowns, but Manning had plenty of other reliable options, including Eric Decker (97 receptions, 1,288 yards, 11 touchdowns), Wes Welker (73 receptions, 778 yards, 10 touchdowns) and Pro Bowl tight end Julius Thomas (65 receptions, 788 yards, 12 touchdowns). Overall, they made Denver the first team in NFL history ever to have four players with at least 10 touchdown receptions in a season. Running back Knowshon Moreno was the team's leading rusher with 1,038 yards and 10 touchdowns, while also catching 60 passes for 548 yards and another three scores. Rookie running back Montee Ball was also a big contributor with 554 rushing yards, four touchdowns and 20 receptions. The team's offensive line featured Pro Bowl guard Louis Vasquez. On special teams, Pro Bowl kicker Matt Prater ranked second in the NFL in scoring (150 points) and first in field goal percentage (.962, 25/26). His only miss of the year was from 52 yards and his successful attempt from 64 yards against Tennessee in Week 14 broke an NFL record that had stood for 44 years.\nDefensive end Shaun Phillips anchored the Broncos' line with 10 sacks, while linebacker Danny Trevathan racked up 129 combined tackles, three forced fumbles and three interceptions. Defensive end Malik Jackson was also a key component of the defense with 42 tackles and six sacks, helping compensate for the loss of Von Miller, who had five sacks in nine games before suffering a season-ending injury. Cornerbacks Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Chris Harris Jr. led the secondary with three interceptions each.\nPlayoffs.\nBoth the Seahawks and Broncos entered the postseason as the number one seed in their respective conferences, which meant they received byes through the first round of the playoffs.\nThe Seahawks' first playoff game was in the NFC divisional round, a rematch of \"Monday Night Football\" from Week 13, playing the New Orleans Saints at home. The Seahawks had a 16-point lead at halftime, but although the Saints were able to halve the deficit in the fourth quarter, they could not close the gap further before a botched play in the final seconds ended the game, with the Seahawks winning 23–15.\nThe Seahawks then played in the NFC Championship Game at home against the rival San Francisco 49ers; the two teams had each won once against the other during the regular season. Despite entering halftime with a seven-point deficit, the Seahawks took the lead in the fourth quarter thanks largely to Colin Kaepernick losing one fumble and throwing two interceptions. The second interception came in the final seconds of the game when Richard Sherman batted the ball into the arms of Malcolm Smith to seal the 23–17 win and send the Seahawks to their second Super Bowl in franchise history.\nThe Broncos faced the San Diego Chargers in the AFC divisional round. Although their record-breaking offense was held to an unusually low 24 points, the Broncos still emerged victorious, 24–17, having shut out the Chargers until the fourth quarter.\nThe AFC Championship Game once again pitted Peyton Manning and his Broncos against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, the 15th matchup between the two veteran quarterbacks. The Broncos won 26–16 on the back of a 400-yard passing performance by Manning, which included two touchdown drives that lasted over seven minutes each, earning the Broncos their first Super Bowl berth since 1998.\nPre-game notes.\nAs the Broncos were the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, they elected to wear their home uniform (orange jerseys with white pants) while the Seahawks wore a mixed uniform (white jerseys with navy blue pants, representing away and home, respectively). With the loss, the Broncos fell to 0–4 (outscored 167–38) in Super Bowls in which they wore orange jerseys, while with the Seahawks' win, the team wearing white had then won nine of the previous ten Super Bowls.\nTeam facilities.\nThe Hyatt Regency in Jersey City served as the home for the Broncos during their stay. The team took up 150 of the 351 rooms until the night of January 29 before taking up the entire hotel. The team hosted the press conferences during the week on a cruise ship docked at the pier of the hotel. Meanwhile, the Seahawks took up 120 to 150 of 429-room Westin Hotel, also in Jersey City. The team retrofitted some rooms into training and massage rooms and occupied the pool. The City of Jersey City renamed its main boulevard, Columbus Drive, to Super Bowl Drive to welcome the teams.\nThe Broncos utilized the New York Jets headquarters, Atlantic Health Jets Training Center in Florham Park, while the Seahawks utilized the New York Giants headquarters, Quest Diagnostics Training Center adjacent to MetLife Stadium.\nSuper Bowl week.\nSince New York and New Jersey co-hosted the Super Bowl, pregame events took place in both states.\nThe \"Super Bowl Kickoff Spectacular\" concert was held on January 27 at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, headlined by Daughtry and featuring a fireworks show. Media Day took place on January 28 at the Prudential Center in Newark.\nThe NFL replaced its indoor NFL Experience fan attraction with an outdoor festival known as Super Bowl Boulevard, which was held along Broadway and Times Square in Manhattan from January 29 to February 1. The event featured various fan-oriented events and attractions, including an artificial toboggan hill. As the area was expected to see around 400,000 people, security was increased in the area. NFL On Location and an NFL Tailgate Party was held at the Meadowlands Sports Complex prior to the game.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII was televised by Fox in the United States, with Joe Buck calling play-by-play, Troy Aikman as color analyst, and Pam Oliver and Erin Andrews as sideline reporters. Fox planned to use multiple 4K resolution cameras to provide the ability to zoom closer into certain camera angles, and due to the expected possibility of cold weather, graphics developed by Autodesk would display simulations of wind patterns inside the stadium. Fox constructed an enclosed studio in Times Square for use as part of studio programming on Fox and Fox Sports 1 during the week of the game.\nThe broadcast attracted 111.5 million viewers, becoming the most-watched event in U.S. television history and surpassing the previous record of 111.3 million viewers who watched Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. Episodes of \"New Girl\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" were the lead-out programs.\nFor the first time in Super Bowl history, a dedicated Spanish language telecast of the game was broadcast in the United States. The broadcast was carried by sister cable network Fox Deportes as part of a larger package of marquee games simulcast by Fox, and featured commentary and surrounding coverage in that language. As with all NFL games, the Spanish play-by-play was also carried via Fox's SAP feed. John Laguna was the play-by-play announcer and Brady Poppinga was the color analyst. With 561,000 viewers, the Fox Deportes broadcast was the highest-rated U.S. Spanish-language cable telecast outside of soccer.\nAdvertising.\nFox set the sales rate for a 30-second advertisement at US$4 million, matching the price set by CBS for Super Bowl XLVII. Fox began selling advertising for the game in May 2013 and announced it had sold out on December 4.\n\"USA Today\"s Super Bowl Ad Meter named Budweiser's ad \"Puppy Love\" as the best of the game. Meanwhile, a Coca-Cola spot with people of diverse cultures singing \"America the Beautiful\" in various languages ignited controversy, with political commentators such as Glenn Beck, Todd Starnes and Allen West condemning the ad for discouraging assimilation, while others considered it a tribute to the idea of the United States as a multicultural society.\nParamount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Lionsgate, Warner Bros., Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Following \"Monsters vs. Aliens footsteps, Paramount paid for the debut trailers for ' and \"Noah\", Sony paid for \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\", \"RoboCop\", \"The Monuments Men\", and \"Pompeii\", Lionsgate paid for \"Draft Day\", Warner Bros. paid for \"The Lego Movie\", Universal paid for \"Neighbors\", and Disney paid for \"\", \"Need for Speed\", and \"Muppets Most Wanted\".\nInternational.\nNFL Network produced an international television feed of the game, with alternate English-language commentary provided by Bob Papa (play-by-play) and Charles Davis (color analyst).\nStreaming.\nFor the third consecutive year, a webcast was provided for viewers. Fox streamed its coverage of the game online on PCs and tablets through its new TV Everywhere service Fox Sports Go. Although normally requiring a television subscription to use, Fox made the service available as a free preview for the Super Bowl. Due to contractual restrictions imposed by the NFL's exclusive digital and mobile content deals with Microsoft and Verizon Communications, Fox was unable to offer any additional camera angles or offer streaming on smartphones. Mobile streaming of the game was exclusive to the Verizon Wireless NFL Mobile service.\nSocial media.\nThe social network Twitter estimated that Super Bowl XLVIII generated 24.9 million posts (\"tweets\") on the service (surpassing last year's total of 24.1), peaking at 381,605 tweets per-minute following Percy Harvin's kickoff return at the start of the second half (surpassing the 231,500 per-minute peak the previous year during the blackout). 57% of the ads broadcast during the game promoted an associated hashtag, up from 50% in 2013.\nRadio.\nNational coverage.\nThe game was nationally broadcast on Westwood One radio, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason as color analyst, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray hosted the network's pregame, halftime and post-game coverage. Scott Graham, who hosted additional pregame coverage for Westwood One, also served as MetLife Stadium's public address system announcer for the game.\nLocal market coverage.\nThe flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their local play-by-play calls. In Seattle, KIRO-FM (97.3) and KIRO (710 AM) carried the \"Seahawks Bing Radio Network\" call with Steve Raible on play-by-play and Warren Moon with color commentary, while in Denver, the Broncos play-by-play from the \"Denver Broncos Radio Network\" aired on KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5) with the play-by-play of Dave Logan and the color commentary of Ed McCaffrey. The Spanish-language partner of the Broncos, KJMN (92.1)/KMXA (1090) carried the game in that language for the Denver market. Sirius XM Radio carried the Westwood One and local team feeds over satellite radio, along with the call in eight other languages. Outside of those stations, all the other stations in the Seahawks and Broncos radio networks carried the Westwood One call per NFL rules. KOA and KIRO are both clear-channel stations, which allowed listeners throughout most of the western US to hear the portion of the contest which continued past sunset local time.\nInternational radio coverage.\nWestwood One's coverage was simulcast on TSN Radio in Canada.\nIn the United Kingdom, Absolute Radio 90s carried the game for the first time, taking over rights from the BBC, who carried the contest for several years prior. The in-house Absolute Radio broadcast featured Darren Fletcher on color commentary (the same capacity in which he served with the BBC), Rocky Boiman with additional contributions and Will Gavin on play-by-play.\nEntertainment.\nPregame.\nThe pregame show began with the Rutgers Scarlet Knights Marching Band and Syracuse University Marching Band. Queen Latifah, joined by the New Jersey Youth Chorus, sang \"America the Beautiful\".\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was then sung by Renée Fleming accompanied by the Armed Forces Chorus, the first (and, so far, only) opera singer ever to do so at a Super Bowl. A V-shaped formation of three United States Army Black Hawks, three Apache attack helicopters and three Chinook heavy-lifters did a military flyover timed with the last note of the song.\nHalftime show.\nOn September 8, 2013, the league announced that Bruno Mars would perform at halftime. On January 10, 2014, it was announced that Red Hot Chili Peppers would be joining Mars as halftime show performers. The show opened with a children's choir singing a chorus from \"Billionaire\". Afterward, Mars appeared, playing a drum solo. Mars then performed the songs \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"Treasure\", \"Runaway Baby\", \"Give It Away\" (with Red Hot Chili Peppers) and \"Just the Way You Are\" as a tribute to the United States Armed Forces. The halftime performance was the most watched in the history of the Super Bowl drawing in a record 115.3 million viewers, passing the record 114 million who watched Madonna perform two years earlier. It was later revealed that the music was pre-recorded. Red Hot Chili Pepper's drummer, Chad Smith responded on Twitter by saying \"FYI... Every band in the last 10 years at the Super Bowl has performed to a previously recorded track. It's the NFL's policy.\"\nPlanners initially indicated there would not be a halftime show at all due to the possibility of poor weather conditions. One such logistical problem would be assembling and disassembling the halftime show stage during a blizzard. But the league went ahead after all. According to Mike Florio of Profootballtalk.com, the NFL wanted to avoid a repeat of Super Bowl XXVI when Fox counter-programmed a special live episode of \"In Living Color\". Fox had not yet become a television partner with the NFL and saw an opportunity to pull young audiences away from a halftime show that lacked big-name performers. As a result of Fox's ratings success, the league tapped Michael Jackson to perform during the following season's Super Bowl XXVII, and since then the league has continued to book big-name talent to hold the television audience.\nTouchdown Entertainment, the company that produced the event, incorporated the live audience into the show and transformed the crowd into \"the largest ever LED screen\". During the show, spectators put on a black knitted hat called a \"video ski hat\" with 3 embedded LEDs that lit up on command. The hats transformed the audience into an enormous human video screen made up of over 80,000 pixels. Images including the Pepsi logo flashed across the crowd, as well as video of the live Red Hot Chili Peppers performance and fireworks display. Thanks to this technology, each spectator was integrated to the show and the Super Bowl Halftime claimed to feature the largest-ever human video screen. In an original idea by Nuno Lopes, the company that invented and provided the crowd activation technology is the Montreal-based company PixMob.\nGame summary.\nThe game kicked off at 6:32 p.m. EST ().\nFirst half.\nOn Denver's first play after receiving the opening kickoff, center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball while quarterback Peyton Manning was shifting forward (from shotgun formation) in the process of calling an audible, resulting in the ball going past Manning into the end zone. Running back Knowshon Moreno recovered the ball to prevent a Seahawks touchdown, but he was downed for a safety to give the Seahawks a 2–0 lead. Seattle's score just 12 seconds into the game was the quickest to start a game in Super Bowl history, surpassing the kickoff return by Devin Hester to start Super Bowl XLI seven years earlier. Following the free kick, receiver Percy Harvin gained 30 yards on an end around run to set up Stephen Hauschka's 31-yard field goal, making the score 5–0. Denver was forced to a three-and-out on their next drive, and after the Denver punt, Russell Wilson completed a 37-yard pass to Doug Baldwin, leading to another Hauschka field goal, this one from 33 yards, that increased the lead to 8–0. On the third play of Denver's ensuing possession, Manning was intercepted by Kam Chancellor, giving Seattle a first down on the Denver 37.\nAided by a 15-yard run from Harvin on the first play, Seattle quickly got the ball into the red zone. The Broncos defense eventually managed to force an incomplete pass on third down, but defensive back Tony Carter was flagged for pass interference in the end zone, giving Seattle a first down at the one-yard line. One play later, running back Marshawn Lynch crashed into the end zone, hitting the line so effectively that he ended the play on his feet, scoring a 1-yard touchdown run that made the score 15–0 three minutes into the second quarter.\nAt this point, the Broncos offense finally managed to get moving, picking up a first down for the first time in the game at 10:37 and moving the ball to the Seattle 35-yard line. But on third-and-13, Manning was hit by Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril as he tried to throw a pass to Moreno, causing a high short floater that was intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith and returned 69 yards for a touchdown. After Seattle's kickoff, Denver mounted a drive to the Seahawks' 19-yard line, aided by Demaryius Thomas's 19-yard reception on third-and-5. With just over a minute left in the half, Denver faced fourth-and-2. Rather than kick a field goal, they tried to pick up a first down, but Manning's pass was incomplete, and the score remained 22–0 at the end of the half. The 22-point deficit was the largest faced by the Broncos all season. It was also the third-largest halftime deficit in Super Bowl history; the previous two were also against the Broncos – the Redskins led the Broncos 35–10 in Super Bowl XXII and the 49ers led the Broncos 27–3 in Super Bowl XXIV. Seattle's 22–0 shutout lead at the half also broke the previous record of 20–0 set by the 49ers in Super Bowl XVI.\nSecond half.\nIn order to avoid a big kickoff return, Matt Prater kicked the second half kickoff short, hitting the ground at the Seattle 12-yard line. But it did not stop Harvin from picking the ball out of the air and taking off for an 87-yard touchdown return that increased Seattle's lead to 29–0. The touchdown took place 12 seconds into the second half, exactly the same amount of time that the Seahawks took to score the safety in the first half. It was also the first time that consecutive Super Bowls had kickoff returns for touchdowns (Jacoby Jones' return in Super Bowl XLVII being the previous one, which was also the second half opening kickoff). After an exchange of punts, Eric Decker gave Denver good field position with a 9-yard return to the Denver 45. Two plays later, Manning completed a 23-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas, but cornerback Byron Maxwell knocked the ball out of his hands and Malcolm Smith recovered it, returning the ball seven yards. An unnecessary roughness penalty against Denver added 15 more yards onto the end of the play, giving Seattle the ball at the Denver 42-yard line. Two plays later, Russell Wilson hit tight end Luke Willson for a 12-yard completion on third-and-7 and later completed a 19-yard pass to Ricardo Lockette. On the next play, he threw a short pass to Jermaine Kearse, who broke four tackles as he took off for a 23-yard touchdown reception bringing the score to 36–0.\nDenver finally managed to respond on their next drive, advancing the ball 80 yards as Manning completed six consecutive passes, including a 22-yard completion to Wes Welker, and finished the drive with a 14-yard touchdown toss to Demaryius Thomas on the last play of the third quarter. Welker then caught another pass for a successful two-point conversion, cutting the score to 36–8.\nHowever, any momentum Denver might have gained was quickly snuffed out as Seattle tight end Zach Miller recovered Prater's onside kick attempt on his own 48-yard line. He also caught a 10-yard reception as the Seahawks subsequently drove 52 yards, featuring a 24-yard reception by Kearse, and scored on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Wilson to Baldwin that increased their lead to 43–8. There were more than 11 minutes left in the game, but this turned out to be the final score, as Denver's last three drives resulted in a turnover on downs, a Manning fumble that was forced and recovered by Seattle defensive end Chris Clemons (the only sack of the game for either team), and time expiring in the game.\nGame statistics and notes.\nWilson finished the game 18/25 for 206 yards and two touchdowns. Baldwin was his top receiver with five catches for 66 yards and a score, while Kearse added four catches for 65 and a touchdown. In addition to his 87-yard kickoff return touchdown, Harvin was Seattle's leading rusher with 45 yards, even though he only carried the ball twice. Chancellor had nine tackles and an interception. Manning completed 34/49 passes for 280 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. His top target was Demaryius Thomas, who caught 13 passes (a Super Bowl record) for 118 yards and a touchdown. Welker added eight receptions for 84 yards. Linebacker Danny Trevathan had 12 tackles. Moreno was Denver's leading rusher, but with just 17 yards. Overall, Denver's record setting offense gained only 306 yards, with just 27 yards on the ground.\nSeahawks' linebacker Malcolm Smith received the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award. Denver fell to 2–5 in Super Bowls, while five-time league MVP Manning dropped to 11–12 in the playoffs and 1–2 in the Super Bowl. Including Denver's loss, none of the eight highest-scoring teams in league history won a Super Bowl in the same season and all four teams who entered the championship with the league's leading passer lost the game. Manning's 34 completions and Demaryius Thomas' 13 receptions were both Super Bowl records.\nWith touchdowns scored on offense, defense and special teams, the Seahawks became the first team since the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV to do so. Teams with an interception return for a touchdown also stayed perfect, improving to 12–0 in Super Bowls. As a result of scoring their safety 12 seconds into the game and subsequently never relinquishing the lead for the rest of the game, the Seahawks set a Super Bowl record for holding a lead continuously for the longest time (59:48). Denver became only the second team in the past 30 years to score fewer than 10 points during the course of the game.\nThis was the first time that any NFL game ended with a 43–8 final score, a phenomenon known as scorigami. It is one of three Super Bowls, alongside XXI and XXIV, coincidentally involving the Broncos, where such a phenomenon has occurred.\nFollowing on from his two national championships at USC, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll became just the third coach to win both an NCAA Division 1-A/FBS national championship and a Super Bowl after Jimmy Johnson (Miami and Dallas) and Barry Switzer (Oklahoma and Dallas).\nFinal statistics.\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl XLVIII, The Football Database Super Bowl XLVIII\nIndividual statistics.\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\nMass Transit Super Bowl.\nOrganizers dubbed Super Bowl XLVIII the \"Mass Transit Super Bowl\", emphasizing and encouraging game attendees and other visitors to use public transportation to get to the game and other festivities throughout the region. The host committee in conjunction with other metropolitan transit agencies, such as NJ Transit, the lead agency, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Metropolitan Transportation Authority developed special services, fares, schedules and maps to promote the use of metro area's trains, subways, light rail and buses during Super Bowl Week. The plan was a failure that lead to universal criticism by fans and writers who attended the game due to poor execution and overcrowding. , the diagram is still updated online.\nSecurity and safety.\nThe Super Bowl was considered a level one national security event. To that end, the New Jersey State Police and the NFL host committee installed a chain-link perimeter fence around the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which is located at the intersection of a number of highways. Security planners stated that access to the area would be strictly limited and regulated. To that end, parking spaces were greatly reduced, tailgate parties restricted and walking to the venue strictly prohibited. Taxis and limousines were not permitted to drop off passengers. Passengers for trains to the stadium were limited in what they could carry and were screened before boarding.\nThe area was patrolled on land, by air and by water since it is surrounded by wetlands. More than 3,000 security guards and 700 police officers were on duty on game day. In addition, SWAT teams and snipers were located throughout the stadium. The security effort was overseen by a joint operations center a few miles away from MetLife Stadium, which was staffed by hundreds of people from 35 different agencies ranging from the CIA to the New Jersey Transit Police.\nIn February 2013, controversy arose as mayors of five local municipalities said they would not provide emergency services, stating they have been poorly compensated for past stadium events. One of the mayors, William J. Roseman of Carlstadt, New Jersey, stated: \"The teams don't care about budget caps and what the impacts are on the taxpayers of Carlstadt. I had to cut back my police department budget by a total of a million dollars over the last several years. While we are forced to lay off police officers, the owners of the Jets and Giants are filling their pockets at taxpayers' expense.\"\nDuring the postgame news conference with Super Bowl MVP Malcolm Smith, a man jumped onto the podium, grabbed the microphone and said \"Investigate 9/11. 9/11 was perpetrated by people within our own government.\" Smith did not react hastily but was rather confused and continued on with answering questions from the media. The man quickly walked away but security closed in and he was arrested for trespassing.&lt;ref name=\"Creegan- 9/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Perez- 9/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Cash- 9/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII had seven officials.

        "text": "Canada (IOC country code CAN) has competed at every Winter Olympic Games, and has won at least one medal each time. By total medals, the country's best performance was in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games where Canadian athletes won 29 medals. Canada set a new record for most gold medals won by a country in a single Winter Olympics with 14 at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. This achievement surpassed the previous record of 13 gold medals held by the Soviet Union (1976) and Norway (2002). Both Germany and Norway matched the record total of 14 gold medals in Pyeongchang in 2018. This record has since been surpassed by Norway with 16 at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nCanada has hosted the winter games twice: in Calgary in 1988, and in Vancouver in 2010. Canada has also hosted the Summer Olympic Games once, in 1976 in Montreal.\nMedal tables.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nCanada has never won an Olympic medal in the following current winter sport: Nordic combined.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBiathlon.\nCanada's only medals in biathlon were won by Myriam Bedard in the Albertville and Lillehammer games.\nBobsleigh.\nBobsleigh.\nCanada has won five gold medals in bobsleigh. The first, a surprising victory by Vic Emery's four-man team in Innsbruck (1964). The second was won by Pierre Lueders and Dave MacEachern in the two-man event in Nagano (1998) - a race that produced a rare tie in which both the Canadian pair and an Italian pair were awarded gold (a German pair won bronze). The Canadian men's duo of Justin Kripps and Alex Kovacz would repeat the feat in 2018, tying for gold with a German sled. In the first back to back wins by a two-woman team, Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse won gold medals in Vancouver (2010) and Sochi (2014).\nSkeleton.\nIn the 2006 Turin games Mellisa Hollingsworth-Richards won Canada's first medal in skeleton and later Duff Gibson became the first Canadian to win a gold medal in skeleton in the men's event. At the 2010 Vancouver games, Jon Montgomery won a gold in the men's event.\nCurling.\nCurling is one of the most popular sports in Canada, and both the men's and women's teams have won a medal at each of the five Olympics curling has been held at so far. Canadian curlers also finished in the top 3 places when curling was a demonstration sport in 1988 and 1992. The women's team in 1998, led by skip Sandra Schmirler, the men's team in 2006, led by skip Brad Gushue, the men's team in 2010, led by Kevin Martin, the women's team in 2014 led by Jennifer Jones and the men's team in 2014 led by Brad Jacobs have won gold medals. In 2018, Kaitlyn Lawes and John Morris won gold in the first mixed doubles tournament at a Winter Olympics. \nIce hockey.\nHockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. When Canada's best players (from the National Hockey League) were able to compete starting in 1998, expectations were high for the country's return to glory, but the Czech Republic won gold and the team fell to Finland in the bronze medal game. Canada finally won its first hockey gold in 50 years in Salt Lake City in 2002, sparking national celebrations. \nThe 2010 games were the first Olympics to take place in an NHL market since the league's players started to compete in the games, as Vancouver is home to the Vancouver Canucks.\nWomen's ice hockey was introduced at the Nagano Olympics in 1998, with Canada winning the silver medal. Canada has appeared in every Olympic gold medal game, facing the United States six times (1998, 2002, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022) and Sweden once (2006). Canada has topped the podium five times (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2022), taking silver against the United States twice (1998, 2018).\nNote: Ice hockey was part of the Summer Olympic program for the 1920 games in Antwerp, but is listed here for completeness. As it was held at a Summer Games, it is not counted in the total for Canada's performance at the Winter games.\nLuge.\nFollowing the announcement on December 22, 2017 that the 2014 luge team relay results of the silver medallists Russian team were voided due to team members being banned for doping violations, Canada was expected to be upgraded from fourth to bronze. However, the bans and annulment of results were successfully appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and on 1 February 2018 the results were restored. The IOC intended to appeal the decision to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, however following the Court's upholding of the CAS' decision in the related case of Alexander Legkov, the IOC decided not to proceed with the appeal.\nAlex Gough won Canada's first ever Olympic medal (Bronze) in Luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.\nSkating.\nFigure skating.\nCanada has won at least one medal in figure skating in 14 of the 17 post-war Winter Olympic games (since 1948). Canada's gold medalists are Barbara Ann Scott (1948) and the pairs of Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul (1960); Jamie Salé and David Pelletier (2002); and Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir (2010 and 2018). Canada also won gold in the team event at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Virtue and Moir celebrated a number of firsts at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics when they won the gold medal for Ice Dancing: their first gold medal at their first Olympics, and the first North Americans as well as the youngest pair to win gold in this event. Other notable Canadian skaters include 1976 Bronze medalist Toller Cranston, as well as Brian Orser and Elvis Stojko, both of whom won silver medals in successive games.\nAt the 2022 games Canada originally finished in fourth in the women's team event. After a positive doping test by a member of the gold medallist Russian team, the CAS disqualified her. As a result, Canada's team was expected to be upgraded to a bronze medal. However, on 30 January 2024 the ISU announced the medal reallocation, downgrading Russia to bronze and leaving Canada at fourth. This decision is being appealed by Canada.\nShort track speed skating.\nCanada has benefitted from the addition of short track speed skating to the Olympic program in 1992, winning multiple medals at each games since. Marc Gagnon, who won 3 gold and 2 bronze medals between 1994 and 2002 and François-Louis Tremblay, who has collected 2 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze medals from 2002 to 2010, are among only 5 Canadian Olympians to win a total of 5 medals.\nSpeed skating.\nGaetan Boucher (1000 m and 1500 m in 1984), Catriona Le May Doan (500 m in 1998 and 2002), Cindy Klassen (1500 m in 2006), Clara Hughes (5000 m in 2006), Christine Nesbitt (1000 m in 2010) and Ted-Jan Bloemen (10000 m in 2018) are Canada's gold medalists in speed skating. In 2006, Cindy Klassen became the first Canadian to ever win five medals in one winter games, winning one gold (1500 m), two silver (Team Pursuit and 1000 m) and two bronze medals (3000 m and 5000 m). She also won a bronze medal in the 2002 games, giving her 6 medals, surpassing short track speed skater Marc Gagnon for the title of most decorated Canadian Winter Olympian. However, Clara Hughes was able to tie Klassen's record following her bronze medal in 2010. In addition to this, Hughes won 2 bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics, one in 2002 Winter Olympics (making her the first Canadian to have won a medal in both the Summer and Winter Olympics), and two in 2006.\nSkiing.\nAlpine skiing.\nCanada's most celebrated alpine skier is Nancy Greene, who won gold and silver at the 1968 games in Grenoble.\nCross country skiing.\nCanada's first medal in cross country skiing was the gold won by Beckie Scott in Salt Lake City (2002), the first time a North American woman won any Olympic medal in this sport. Chandra Crawford followed this up at the next games with a gold medal in the sprint event, and the team of Scott and Sara Renner also won a silver medal in Turin (2006).\nFreestyle skiing.\nCanada has enjoyed success in freestyle skiing after its introduction to the Winter Olympics in 1992. Jean-Luc Brassard (1994), Jennifer Heil (2006), Alexandre Bilodeau (2010 &amp; 2014), Justine Dufour-Lapointe (2014), and Mikael Kingsbury (2018) have won gold in the moguls event. Canada has won gold in the women's ski cross at every olympics that featured it (Ashleigh McIvor, 2010; Marielle Thompson, 2014; and Kelsey Serwa, 2018). Brady Leman (2018) won gold in the men's ski cross event. In 2014 and 2018 the Canadian women also took the silver medals (Serwa in 2014, and Brittany Phelan in 2018). Dara Howell took gold in the slopestyle event in 2014. Cassie Sharpe added a halfpipe gold in 2018.\nCanadian skiers also finished in the top 3 positions in aerials at the 1988 and 1992 games, when it was a demonstration sport.\nNordic combined.\nCanada has never won an Olympic medal in the Nordic combined competition. Their best finish was tenth in the individual normal hill competition at the 1932 games.\nSki jumping.\nCanada won the bronze medal in the mixed team ski jumping event at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nSnowboarding.\nRoss Rebagliati won a gold medal in snowboarding when the sport made its Olympic debut at the 1998 Nagano games. Initially he was stripped of the medal when traces of marijuana were found in his blood during a drug test, but the IOC reversed its decision after an appeal a few days later because marijuana was only a restricted substance, not a banned substance."

        "text": "The American Football Association (AFA) was the first attempt in the United States to form an organizing soccer body. It was the second oldest sports league to form, behind the National League of baseball in 1876, as well as being the oldest soccer league in the United States. The Association was formed in 1884 in an attempt to standardize rules and procedures. It was allied with The Football Association, becoming a member on February 22, 1909, at an FA meeting chaired by Charles Clegg, and drew on that organization's approach to the game. As part of its efforts, the AFA directly organized both league and cup competitions as well as overseeing the operations of member leagues. In 1884, it established the American Cup, which for several decades was the highest competitive soccer competition in the United States. The weakness of the AFA lay in its refusal to expand outside the southern New England region. When a movement began to create a national governing body in 1911, the AFA found itself confronting the newly established American Amateur Football Association (AAFA), a body which quickly became national. The AFA argued that it should be recognized by FIFA. However, several member organizations defected from the AFA to the AAFA in 1912. The AAFA quickly moved to reform itself as the United States Football Association, receiving FIFA recognition in 1913. The AFA continued to run the American Cup until 1925, but by that time it had been superseded by the National Challenge Cup and National Amateur Cup."
