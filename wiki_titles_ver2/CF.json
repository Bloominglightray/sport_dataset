        "text": "Bobby Ray Jones Jr. (born 9 January 1984) is an American-born naturalised-Equatorial Guinean professional basketball player who last played for Scaligera Basket of the Italian Serie A2. He notably played for an NBA record five different teams in a single season (2007–08), later moving to Italy to continue his career.\nCollege career.\nJones played high school basketball with Dominguez (Compton, California) for three years – playing alongside Tyson Chandler – before moving to Long Beach Polytechnic for his senior year amidst the controversial nomination of Mack Calvin as coach.\nHe joined the University of Washington, playing in the Pacific-10 Conference of the NCAA Division I, in May 2002.\nPlaying 27 games as a freshman, the last 15 as a starter, he averaged 4.1 rebounds per game. As a sophomore, he was involved in 31 games (25 starts), posting averages of 11.2 points. His junior season saw him start all but one of the 34 games he played in, contributing 11.2 points and a team-best 5.6 rebounds for Washington as they won the 2005 Pac-10 tournament for the first time.\nHe averaged 10.4 points and 4.9 rebounds in his senior season. At the end of his Huskies career in 2006, Jones was ranked 20th among the school's all-time scorers with 1,226 career points and 4th in career steals with 134.\nHis last collegiate game was the NABC College All-Star game.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia 76ers (2006–2007).\nJones was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 37th pick in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft on 28 June 2006, he was traded the same day to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for a 2007 second-round draft pick and cash considerations.\nHe was assigned to the Fort Worth Flyers of the NBA Development League on 28 November, averaging 13.7 points and 8 rebounds in around 24 minutes per game over 3 games, before being recalled on 8 December.\nWith the Sixers he would have 2.5 points and 1.3 rebounds in more than 7 minutes per game in the NBA over 44 appearances, with an end of season flourish of 13.5 points and 3.8 rebounds in 31 minutes on average over the last four games of the season.\nDenver Nuggets (2007–2008).\nOn 10 September 2007, the Denver Nuggets announced they had traded for Jones and Steven Hunter in exchange of Reggie Evans and Ricky Sanchez's draft rights.\nHe was waived by the Nuggets on 7 January 2008, having averaged 3.3 points and 1.4 rebounds in 23 games.\nMemphis Grizzlies (2008).\nThe Memphis Grizzlies signed Jones to a 10-day contract on 10 January 2008.\nAfter posting 20 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists in a matchup with the Seattle SuperSonics, he was signed to another 10-day contract, the last one the Grizzlies could offer before signing for the season or releasing him.\nSioux Falls Skyforce (2008).\nThe Grizzlies did not offer Jones a new contract and he moved to D-League side Sioux Falls Skyforce, playing only two games.\nHouston Rockets (2008).\nJones was called up by the Houston Rockets on 26 February 2008.\nReturn to the Skyforce (2008).\nReturning to the Skyforce after ten days passed, Jones played in one game before again being called back to the NBA.\nMiami Heat (2008).\nJones signed a 10-day contract with the Miami Heat on 12 March 2008.\nPosting 8 points and 4 rebounds in nearly 24 minutes per game over six contests with Miami, including a team-high 15 points in his final game, was not enough to earn a contract extension.\nThird stint with the Skyforce (2008).\nJones returned to the Skyforce at the expiry of his contract with the Heat. He would play only two more games for the Skyforce.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2008).\nJones signed for his fifth NBA team of the season (by now a record), the San Antonio Spurs, on 1 April 2008.\nRight after that contract, on 11 April, Jones was re-signed by the Denver Nuggets on a deal until August, with a non-guaranteed option for the next season.\nFourth stint with the Skyforce (2008–2009).\nOn 28 July 2008, Jones was traded along with Taurean Green and 2010 draft second round pick for the New York Knicks' Renaldo Balkman and cash considerations. \nIn effect he was just a bargaining chip in a salary dump by the Knicks, who – with 17 players compared to the league maximum of 15 – were widely expected to cut him, which happened the next day.\nOn 5 August 2008, he was claimed off waivers by the Miami Heat, but after Yakhouba Diawara was signed at his position two days later, he was again waived on 15 August.\nHe joined the Sacramento Kings' training camp on 30 September, before being waived again on 21 October.\nReturning to the Sioux Falls Skyforce in November 2008, he spent the 2008–09 D-League season with the team, finishing with 16.1 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists in more than 34 minutes per game after playing 49 games.\nBanca Tercas Teramo (2009–2010).\nJones played with the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA Summer League from 13 to 19 July 2009, posting 7.4 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.6 steals in nearly 25 minutes per game.\nHe declared preferring an overseas move over another D-League contract if he did not make an NBA team by mid-to-late August, which happened sooner as he signed a contract with Italian Serie A side Banca Tercas Teramo on 24 July 2009.\nHis Teramo career started well as he scored a team-high 16 points in the 27 October game against APOEL, including two contest-winning free-throws with 5 seconds left to play, that helped the Italians reach the group stage of the European second-tier Eurocup.\nHe finished the competition 12 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.3 steals over 27 minutes per game, posting 11 points 3.6 rebounds and 1.8 steals in around 25 minutes per game domestically, all the while mystifying observers by alternating great performances and apathetic no-shows.\nSutor Montegranaro (2010–2011).\nDespite having one-year left on his two-year contract with, Jones bemoaned his difficulties living abroad and adapting to the European game (especially officiating and training), publicly contemplating a departure.\nHe left Teramo but stayed in Italy and the Serie A, signing for Fabi Shoes Montegranaro in July 2010.\nAveraging 7.8 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2 steals in around 22 minutes per game, Jones did not convince Montegranaro, who replaced him with Ryan Toolson and released him in March 2011.\nFulgor Libertas Forlì (2011).\nJones moved right after to Fulgor Libertas Forlì of the second division LegaDue.\nForlì – at the time battling to avoid relegation – won 8 of 9 games played after Jones' arrival to stave off relegation, with the American contributing 17.2 points, 9 rebounds and 3 steals per game.\nPistoia Basket (2011–2012).\nJones did not answer Forlì's attempts to extend his contract, penning another with rival LegaDue side Giorgio Tesi Group Pistoia in July 2011.\nAt first struggling with fouls, committing more (4.3) than any other player in the league at one stage, that limited his playing time, Jones flourished after being repositioned as a power forward halfway through the season, augmenting his points and rebounds averages whilst diminishing his ejections (3 compared to 7 earlier in the season).\nHe averaged 14.4 points and 7.9 rebounds over the season, with some decisive performances in the promotion playoffs to help Pistoia reach the finals against Enel Brindisi, though they were thwarted in their efforts to earn the lone Serie A spot. \nThat was in spite of an incredible game 3 performance from Jones, that saw him contribute 31 points, 9 rebounds and 2 steals while drawing 12 fouls to earn a game-high valutation of 37, in a victory that kept the series alive at the time.\nVirtus Roma (2012–2015).\nJones returned to the Serie A in all cases, signing a deal with Acea Roma on 26 July 2012.\nUnequal performances saw him average 6.6 points and 4.6 rebounds (with a receding 2.5 fouls) in around 19 minutes per game during the regular season.\nHe had a more positive impact during the playoffs, starting in the quarterfinal series against Trendwalker Reggio Emilia, with 16 points and 9 rebounds coupled and a good defense on Andrea Cinciarini during game 3, then 9 points and 10 rebounds for a +/- of +19 in the decisive game 7.\nIn the finals series against Montepaschi Siena, he was determinant in a diverse way, scoring only 3 points but committing 4 fouls, including an unsportsmanlike foul when he held back Daniel Hackett by his jersey with only 41 seconds left in the game, which moved Siena's lead from 3 to an unassailable 7, as they claimed the title in the following game.\nHe ended the playoffs having played 19 matches in total, for 9.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 steals in nearly 27 minutes on average.\nOn 23 August 2013, Jones re-signed with Roma for another season.\nRome had expected him to acquire Cotonou status (allowing him to have EU status on the roster), however, Jones' efforts to acquire a Dominican Republic passport were unsuccessful and he was not played by Rome to avoid going over the foreigner limit.\nAfter acquiring a passport from Equatorial Guinea, Jones played his first league game of the season on 10 November, posting 20 points (from 80% shooting accuracy), 4 rebounds and 1 assist to help a Rome side coming from two defeats beat Caserta.\nThe team's next game in the Eurocup, in which Jones had been able to play earlier in the season, also saw him in good form, posting a team-high 19 points against Bonn (that proved to his season high in the competition, he averaged 8.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in nearly 22 minutes as Roma exited at the group stage). \nIn Serie A, Jones had a consistent 2013–14 season, finishing with 11.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.2 assists in nearly 28 minutes across 31 games, as Roma's playoff run was again stopped by Montepaschi, this time in the semifinal, notwithstanding a good game 4 performance from Jones (18 points) that brought them their only win in the series.\nJones was the only Virtus player reconfirmed the next year, as the cash-strapped club assembled a squad made of rookies and players unproven in the Serie A.\nThe team predictably struggled, with Jones one of few to perform well, he was singled out by the La Gazzetta dello Sport as one of the unrehalded key men of the league (and one of the best defenders).\nHe was also decisive in the Italians' Eurocup campaign where his good output, including a 19 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists game against Nymburk that gave him a PIR of 36, helped them reach the Last 32.\nThis streak continued in that round, with Jones contributing 8 rebounds and 18 points, of which a three-point play that sent the game to overtime, as Roma beat Krasny Oktyabr on their way to the Eighthfinals.\nHis form dipped afterwards, he had little impact in the Eighhfinals defeat to Banvit, before a hand fracture ended his season in mid-April, leaving Rome short of his leadership and defense.\nHis average statistics at the end of the season read: 11.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.5 steals in nearly 29 minutes in the Serie A, 11.1 points, 4.6 rebounds 2.1 assists and 1.3 steals over 27 minutes in the Eurocup.\nJuvecaserta (2015–2016).\nWith Roma reported to have opted out of the second year on his contract, Jones became a free agent, signing with fellow Serie A side Juvecaserta for the 2015–16 season on 7 August 2015.\nCasalpusterlengo (2016–2017).\nOn 13 July 2016, Unione Cestistica Casalpusterlengo was reported to have signed Jones. On 15 March 2017, Jones was reported to have parted-way with Unione Cestistica Casalpusterlengo.\nPallacanestro Mantovana (2017–2018).\nOn 9 July 2017, Pallacanestro Mantovana was reported to have signed Jones. \nKienergia Rieti (2018–2019).\nOn 28 September 2018, NPC Rieti was reported to have signed Jones.\nKumamoto Vorters (2019).\nJones started off the 2019–20 season with the Kumamoto Vorters.\nRoseto Sharks (2019–2020).\nOn 2 December 2019, Jones signed with Roseto Sharks of the Italian Serie A2. \nScaligera (2020–2021).\nOn 9 January 2020, Jones signed with Scaligera Basket of the Italian Serie A2. \nInternational career.\nWhilst at Washington, Jones was part of the United States representative national team that went to the 2005 Summer Universiade, played in İzmir (Turkey) that August.\nHe averaged 2.4 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1 assist and steal apiece off the bench as the unbeaten U.S. team took home gold.\nNBA career statistics.\nSource.\nFilm maker.\nIn his third year playing basketball in Italy, Jones wrote a post to his blog, Bobby's World, called \"The Overseas Basketball Life: Part 1.\" This entry detailed the reality of his experience playing ball and living abroad. For \"Part 2,\" he found that he had too much to say - and so he decided to create a movie. Tens of thousands of dollars spent, countless hours worked, and two years later, Basketball Jones: The Overseas Journey was finished, a 90-minute documentary about the 2,000 \"job openings\" filled annually by expatriate American ballers overseas. Basketball Jones explores why some players can make it abroad while others cannot, told through the testimonials of nine American basketball players. Jones has screened Basketball Jones at his alma mater Long Beach Poly in Los Angeles, in Rome, and in Seattle in July 2015. "

        "text": "The Seattle Rugby Club (formerly Seattle Saracens and Old Puget Sound Beach after a merger) is a rugby union club based in Seattle. The club travels throughout the US and into Canada. In 2014 the club was ranked as the number one US club while also playing in a Canadian league based in British Columbia (BCRU). Old Puget Sound Beach was a charter member of the now defunct USA Super League in the Pacific Coast USA Rugby territory.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1966, Seattle RFC was a group of enthusiastic rugby players who had responded to an ad in the local \"Seattle Times\" looking to get a game of rugby going.\nOld Puget Sound Beach Rugby Football Club played its first game in the fall of 1971.\nIn 1996, Seattle RFC joined with the local women's rugby club called the Breakers. This proved to be an opportunity for both men and women to prosper in the Pacific Northwest Rugby Football Union. The women's USA Division-1 team has consecutively been within the top 16, ‘Sweet 16’, in the nation and continues to play in the BCRU Premier League.\nFor decades, Seattle and OPSB were local adversaries and had many spirited matches. In 2006, Seattle RFC men's teams and OPSB's men's teams combined resources and were able to field a squad in the now defunct USA Rugby Super League as well as 2 squads in the BC Rugby Union's 1st and 2nd division in Canada.\nSeattle–OPSB (2006–2014).\nAfter years of mixed success, the Super League teams grew a culture of winning and reached the playoff rounds 3 years in a row, and the finals twice. The BCRU teams were also consistently near the top teams in their respective divisions, reaching the playoffs in most of their seasons. A combined 8 National Sevens titles, as well as winning the bowl in the 2014 World Club Sevens Championships, success was proven achievable on the big stages. With an injection of talented players and coaching staff such as Waisale Serevi, Ben Gollings, and Justin Fitzpatrick, Seattle-OPSB felt ready to take the next steps towards growing the club and rugby in the Pacific Northwest.\nSaracens (2014–2020).\nIn June 2014, Seattle-OPSB joined the Saracens Global Network, renaming themselves as Seattle Saracens. They were the ninth team to join the network, after VVA Saracens, São Paulo Saracens, Abu Dhabi Saracens, KL Saracens, Impala Saracens Nairobi, Timișoara Saracens and Toa Saracens.\nOn May 9, 2015, the Seattle Saracens beat Meraloma Rugby 26–25 in the Division 1 final. As a result, they were promoted to the CDI Premier League.\nSeattle Rugby Club (2020–present).\nIn 2018 after the Saracens partnership ended, the club board chose to return to their original orca art logo, but kept the name Seattle Saracens. Two years later, during the 2019-20 season, the entire club’s players, members, and coaching staff voted overwhelmingly to rebrand themselves. Officially changing their name to the Seattle Rugby Club in July 2020."

He had good hopes of winning both the stage and the yellow jersey: He was 25 seconds behind Armstrong in the general classification, but winning the first intermediate sprint gained him 6 seconds, and winning the stage would have gained an extra 20 seconds bonus. If Zabel would not succeed, Jalabert would have had his chance: A third place in the first bonus sprint gained him 2 seconds, just enough to take the yellow.\nHowever, either man could easily lose the yellow if an attacker would end before the peloton. Stéphane Berges, Christophe Mengin and Ludo Dierckxsens gave it a try, and had a maximum lead of 4'10\". However, the peloton caught them back, and on a short but difficult climb another group with important riders like Armstrong and Botero got away. They were caught back as well, but Moreau lost contact with the peloton during the chase.\nAfter yet another attack, the peloton came in full to the finish, Zabel's Telekom team preparing what they hoped would be a win for their leader. However, 1 km before the finish the unknown Swiss rider Rubens Bertogliati attacked, and surprisingly was able to hold out until the finish. Zabel won the spurt of the peloton, but Bertogliati gained both the stage and the yellow jersey. Moreau's poor start continued, he crashed twice and lost 3'20\", and his chances seem over.\n\"Note:\" David Millar got to wear the white jersey, as a rider cannot wear two leading jerseys at the same time.\nStage 2.\n8 July 2002 — Luxembourg to Saarbrücken, \n\"Note:\" David Millar got to wear the white jersey, as a rider cannot wear two leading jerseys at the same time.\nStage 3.\n9 July 2002 — Metz to Reims, \nJacky Durand, always known for his attacking style, often riding ahead of the peloton for a large part of the stage, did it again this time. He attacked after 3 km, and got Franck Rénier with him. In the peloton, the third places in the bonus sprints (gaining 2 seconds) were fought. Ján Svorada took the first one before Zabel, protecting the interests of his teammate Bertogliati, but Zabel won the second and third, thus passing Bertogliati in the general classification.\nThe lead of Durand and Rénier grew to a maximum of 11'10\", but combined work by the Telekom (Zabel) and Lotto (McEwen) teams finally led to the two being nevertheless caught back. Hushovd tried to win 'Bertogliati-style', but also failed, and Robbie McEwen showed himself the strongest in the sprint. Zabel was second, but nevertheless very happy, since he took over the yellow jersey. Bertogliati, happy to have worn it for three days, is still not without honour: He now carries the white jersey of the best young rider.\n\"Note:\" Robbie McEwen got to wear the green jersey, as a rider cannot wear two leading jerseys at the same time.\nStage 4.\n10 July 2002 — Épernay to Château Thierry, (team time trial)\nThe team time trial had been removed from the Tour some years earlier, but in 2001 it had been re-instated. This year's team time trial looked like it was going to be won by CSC Tiscali (Jalabert) in a close fight with ONCE (Beloki, González de Galdeano), with US Postal (Armstrong) not far behind. However, the CSC Tiscali team had to wait when Sandstød had a puncture, and because of that fell to third place. In the general classification the result brought a large change, the first 14 places now being taken by ONCE and US Postal riders, with Igor González de Galdeano in the yellow. Several of the main riders from the other teams already are over 2 minutes behind González de Galdeano, Beloki and Armstrong.\nStage 5.\n11 July 2002 — Soissons to Rouen, \nSeveral attacks were made in the early part of the race, but none of these lasted very long until Jaan Kirsipuu, Christophe Edaleine, Stefano Casagranda, Michael Sandstød and Ludo Dierckxsens escaped 85 km from the finish. The ONCE team of yellow jersey González de Galdeano led the peloton, but did not make attempts to catch the five back, since they were enough behind in the general classification (over 4 minutes) not to threaten González de Galdeano. This changed when the teams of the sprinters (with the notable exception of Zabel's Telekom team) took over the lead. However, they came too late, and the five got to sprint for the stage win. Kirsipuu showed that he was by far the best sprinter among them, and took the stage. Another sprinter, Belgian's Tom Steels was less lucky and was the first to abandon this year, Marco Pinotti also abandoned on this stage. McEwen won the sprint for sixth place, but Zabel's ninth place gave him just enough points to keep the green jersey.\nStage 6.\n12 July 2002 — Forges-les-Eaux to Alençon, \nMany attacks came in the first part of the stage, with Karsten Kroon being found among the attackers several times, but none could stay away for long until Steffen Wesemann, Jacky Durand, Paul Van Hyfte, Emmanuel Magnien, Massimo Apollonio and Constantino Zaballa made the attack. However, they too were caught back about 10 km before the finish, and the Tour saw another mass spurt. This time Erik Zabel, whose did not need to ride behind the escapers since Wesemann is also from his team, won the spurt, before Freire and McEwen. The three are clearly the best sprinters in this year's tour. Alexander Shefer and Rik Verbrugghe gave up today.\nStage 7.\n13 July 2002 — Bagnoles-de-l'Orne to Avranches, \nAs in the previous stages, many attacks were made in the beginning, and one group finally managed to stay ahead - this time Franck Rénier, Léon van Bon and Antony Morin were the ones to try. However, the teams of the sprinters caught them back again. 1 km before the finish, Pedro Horrillo tried to win the race by a late escape. However, Bradley McGee showed his capacities in uphill sprinting, and overtook Horillo during the final sprint. Horillo, in the end, got third place for his attempt. The last few kilometres were hectic, with several crashes. Among the casualties were Moreau and Freire, finishing far behind, but also Armstrong. With the help of the rest of the US Postal team he diminished his loss, but at the finish he was still 27 seconds behind, dropping him from third to eighth place in the GC, the first 7 places all being taken by ONCE riders. Interesting detail for this stage is that all 4 participating Australians finished in the top-8. Didier Rous did not finish the stage.\nStage 8.\n14 July 2002 — Saint-Martin-de-Landelles to Plouay, \nA group of seven escaped this time, consisting of Franck Rénier, Sébastien Hinault, Stéphane Augé, Erik Dekker, Karsten Kroon, Servais Knaven and Raivis Belohvoščiks. This time the work of the teams from ONCE (González de Galdeano and Beloki) and AG2R (Kirsipuu) was not enough to catch them back, and the seven were to decide who would win the stage. Dekker made several breakaway attempts, then had to drop back, but managed to return. Belohvoščiks seemed to have the best form of the seven, but his attacks were also countered. In the spurt, Kroon won, partly through excellent help from his teammate Dekker. Although it is known that on July 14; Quatorze Juillet) the French riders always do a bit extra to try to win the stage, today it was the Netherlands that scored the first three places. Robbie McEwen won two points on Zabel in the first sprint, and one more at the finish, but it was not enough to take over the green jersey. Óscar Freire and Aart Vierhouten did not start today's stage.\nStage 9.\n15 July 2002 — Lanester to Lorient, (individual time trial)\nAs expected, the time trial did a lot to upset the general classification. Hungarian specialist László Bodrogi set an early time that lasted quite long, until Santiago Botero topped it. In the end, Botero's time was not beaten by anyone, Armstrong coming closest, 11 seconds behind. González de Galdeano lost only 8 seconds to Armstrong, and is now 26 seconds ahead in the GC - note that Armstrong lost 27 seconds in stage 7; he would have worn the yellow with 1 second difference otherwise. Riders like Honchar and Beloki also did not lose much time, so Armstrong might well have a harder fight ahead than the previous years.\nStage 10.\n17 July 2002 — Bazas to Pau, \nThe last stage before the mountains showed the usual pattern: Many attacks in the early part of the stage, then a group that managed to get away. This time the group was relatively large, consisting of 10 riders. Patrice Halgand apparently was of the opinion that this was too many, and attacked on the final climb with 21 km to go. Only Stuart O'Grady, Ludo Dierckxsens and Jérôme Pineau were able to follow. With 8 km to go, he attacked a second time, and rode alone to the finish for a well-deserved victory. O'Grady, the best sprinter in the group, even missed second place as Pineau managed to escape shortly before the finish. On a sad note, a French boy died after having been hit by a car in the caravan preceding and following the Tour."

Uxbridge CC is a member of the Middlesex County Cricket League which is a designated ECB Premier League.\nHistory.\nThere are records of Cricket being played in the Uxbridge area as far back as 1735. The official founding date of Uxbridge Cricket Club is 1789.\nThe first games were played on the Uxbridge Moor area of the town, later moving to Uxbridge Common. In 1858 the club moved again, to a field behind the Eastern end of Uxbridge High Street, and remained there until 1970 when the redevelopment of the town centre obliged the club to seek a new home. The club moved to the present site, opposite Uxbridge Common.\nFor a number of years Middlesex County Cricket Club played County Championship and List-A matches at the Uxbridge Cricket Club Ground. In recent years the County team has moved out of Uxbridge due to the pitch being deemed too batsmen friendly. However, the County has now returned to Uxbridge to play Twenty20 matches from 2003 and has played the odd County game there during 2010.\nThe high points of the club have been the winning of the Thames Valley Cricket League in 1982 followed by reaching the Final of the Evening Standard Challenge Trophy in 2000. Since 1989, Uxbridge has been playing in the Middlesex County Cricket League, the foremost league in the county.\nOther sports.\nThe club offers a number of other sports including bowls, with Uxbridge Bowls Club being founded in 1908. The club has an adjoining rugby club. Uxbridge RFC was formed from two clubs, namely Borderers RFC &amp; Old Creightonians in 1947. In 1991 Uxbridge RFC merged with Uxbridge Cricket Club. The club also has squash and tennis sections."

        "text": "The Kansas City Blues compete in the USA Rugby Division 1, the highest amateur level. They also field a Division 2 team that offers new and inexperienced players the opportunity to learn the game and advance to Division 1. During the summer, the Blues also feature one of the country’s most successful 7s programs. The Blues have been prominent regionally and nationally since their 1966 inception. They have a long history of success, with many tournament and league championships, including several National Championship and Final Four appearances. The club has produced many USA National Team players in both 15s and 7s, along with hosting dozens of National Team players from other countries.\nToday, the Blues consists of men of varying skills and athletic accomplishments. The Blues currently practice and play their home matches at the Children’s Mercy Training Facility at Swope Soccer Village. The Division 1 team competes in the Midwest Rugby Premiership against teams from Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Iowa.\nHistory.\nBased on a loose affiliation with both University of Missouri-Kansas City and Rockhurst College, the Kansas City Blues Rugby Club was established in 1966. The founding members focused on developing a unique club identity and culture. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the Blues elevated their rugby knowledge and skills, becoming successful in the United States by winning prominent annual tournaments, like Aspen Ruggerfest, Heart of America, and St. Louis Ruggerfest. The club built a reputation for playing hard-nosed rugby, always leaving the game on the field, and maintaining close social connections with teammates off the field. \nIn 1993, the Blues won their league, advanced to Nationals, and lost in the Final Four. In 1997, the Blues became founding members of the United States Rugby Super League (USA / 1997-2012), composed of the top 14 teams in the nation. In the inaugural year, the Blues made it to the Super League Final Four. Over the next ten years, the Blues competed in RSL with several winning seasons. \nIn 2007, the Blues decided to restructure and move back to Division 1. The club successfully rebuilt and, in 2012, became the second club to send two separate teams to the National 15s playoffs round of eight, competing in the Division 1 and the Division 3 National Playoffs. Ultimately, the Division 1 team lost a close match (23-20) to Belmont Shore (California), who won the National Championship that season. In 2014-2015, the Blues went to the Division 1 National Championship but lost in the round of eight to Mystic River (Boston). \nThe Blues field a Division 1 team that competes in the Midwest Rugby Premiership, along with other teams from Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Columbus, and Cincinnati. The Division 2 team competes in the Heart of America League with other regional teams, like St. Louis and Omaha. Since the Blues joined the Midwest Premiership, they amassed an impressive Division 1 league record of 40-18 from 2013 to 2017.\nIn addition to success on the field in 15s, the Blues are a perennial national power in the game of 7s rugby. The Blues have qualified for and appeared in the 7s National Championship Tournament 14 times from 1990 to 2017. In those 14 appearances, the Blues made the Final Four five times and were National runner up three times, but never won the National Championship. \nIn 1993, the Blues made their first ever 7s Final Four, finishing National runner-up in a close loss to New York Old Blue. Seven years later, the Blues returned to the 2000 National Championship Match and lost. In 2014, the Blues lost in the National Semi-Finals but won a spirited match against regional foe and rivals, the Denver Barbarians, to take 3rd place. Most recently, in 2016, the Blues advanced to the 7s National Championship Match but lost to Utah. The Blues currently host one of the largest and most successful 7s programs in the country. In 2014, the Blues debuted their Sporting 7s Academy program, which takes college-aged players and places them in a special training program designed to increase their fitness and advance their rugby skills. The Blues can field three Blues and Academy in various local and regional tournaments.\nAffiliation.\nOn May 19, 2011, the Blues announced their affiliation with Sporting Kansas City, a Major League Soccer team that had been planning to expand into other sports. The team would be a founding member of the Sporting Club Network and share facilities with the soccer team, including occasional matches at their home stadium Livestrong Sporting Park.\nMatch schedule and travel.\nThe fall season consists of local and regional match play, highlighted by the annual trek to the Aspen Ruggerfest and the start to the split-season West Division 1 North and Division 3 Heart of America League match play. The Club completes the League seasons in the early spring as playoffs loom. Throughout the fall and spring, the Reserve team plays League matches against regional Division 3 clubs.\nRepresentative and international players.\nThe Blues have also sent a number of players to the United States national rugby union team, The Eagles, in both 7s and 15s rugby: \nIn addition to these National Team Players, the Blues have had dozens invited to USA Eagle Tryout camps, made age-graded USA Eagles, and join the first professional rugby league in the United States: Major League Rugby (MLR)."

        "text": "Jimmy \"Browntown\" Boyle (January 19, 1904 in Cincinnati, Ohio – December 24, 1958 in Cincinnati, Ohio), a catcher for the 1926 New York Giants, has the distinction of having one of the shortest known Major League Baseball careers. Although Boyle is only one of about 900 ballplayers who have played in only a single major league game, he is distinguished by having played for only one inning, the ninth inning of a game against Pittsburgh in June of that year (which the Giants lost 8–0). After three outs, Boyle never got to bat and never played again; he is even further distinguished by having never played in the minors, moving straight to the Giants from college. He asked manager John McGraw for his release and it was granted August 2, 1926. \nPlaying History.\nBoyle was called up to New York in the summer of 1926, arriving by Pullman train car. He signed a contract for $250 to play with the Giants, minus a $30 deposit for both his home and away uniforms. His brief career started at the top of the ninth inning when John McGraw sent him to replace Paul Florence behind homeplate at the Polo Grounds. That would be the extent of his career in the Majors.\nFamily History.\nBoyle's family emigrated from Ireland in the 1800s and settled in Cincinnati. His father James worked as a brewery truck driver and a fireman.\nJimmy was a second-generation ballplayer (uncommon in an era when there had only been two generations of ball players); his two uncles Jack and Eddie Boyle were catchers for the Phillies and Pirates, respectively. As well, his brother Buzz Boyle played for the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nBoyle played football and baseball at Xavier University in Cincinnati; he was class president and enjoyed \"feminine companions and Chesterfield cigarettes\" according to his yearbook.\nHe is the grandfather of sportswriter Steve Rushin. His granddaughter remembers seeing his signed Giants contract next to a photo of him in uniform in their house.\nJimmy died of leukemia on Christmas Eve, 1958."

        "text": "Badminton is a sport contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Badminton was first held as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Summer Olympics, and was an exhibition sport at the 1988 Summer Olympics; the men's and women's singles and doubles have been held at every Summer Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. The mixed doubles badminton tournament started in the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nThe Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings are used to determine the qualification of the players for the tournament. Nations can enter a maximum of two players each in the men's and women's singles if both are ranked in the world's top 16; otherwise, one quota place until the roster of thirty-eight players has been completed. Similar regulations also apply to the players competing in the doubles, as the NOCs (National Olympic Committees) can enter a maximum of two pairs if both are ranked in the top eight, while the remaining NOCs are entitled to one until the quota of 16 highest-ranked pairs is filled. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair.\nGao Ling is the all-time leader for the most Olympic medals in badminton, with two gold, one silver, and one bronze; Fu Haifeng (two gold, one silver), Zhang Nan, Zhao Yunlei and Kim Dong-moon (two gold, one bronze) each, Gil Young-ah and Chen Long (one of each) and Lee Chong Wei (three silver) are second for the most medals in badminton, each with three. Fu Haifeng, Gao Ling, Ge Fei, Gu Jun, Kim Dong-moon, Lin Dan, Zhang Jun, Zhang Nan, Zhang Ning and Zhao Yunlei are the all-time leaders for the most gold medal wins, with two. In the 1992 Summer Olympics, future married couple Susi Susanti and Alan Budikusuma won Indonesia their first ever Olympic gold medals since their first Olympic participation in 1952, while brothers Jalani and Razif Sidek were the first Malaysian Olympic medalists since Malaysia first participated the 1964 Summer Olympics. Mia Audina won her first silver in the 1996 Olympics representing Indonesia, but won her second silver in the 2004 Summer Olympics with the Netherlands, the only badminton medalist to ever win for two different countries. In the 2000 Summer Olympics, China swept the women's doubles tournament, winning all three medals, making it the only sweep in Olympic badminton history. Indonesia also did so in the 1992 Olympics men's singles tournament, but there was no bronze medal match in that Games so the medal was shared with Danish player Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen. In the 2012 Summer Olympics, China became the first country to win all five disciplines' gold medal in history, and as of 2020 the only to sweep all five in the same Games. Indonesia became the second to achieve this feat, stretching from its first gold in the 1992 women's singles to 2020 women's doubles.\nAs of the 2020 Summer Olympics, China has been the most successful nation in badminton, winning 47 medals; 33 of them were from the women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles tournaments. Indonesia (21 medals) and South Korea (20 medals) are the only other nations to have more than nine medals. As many as 121 medals (39 gold, 39 silver, and 43 bronze) have been awarded to 153 medalists from 12 NOCs. There were four additional bronze medal winners in the 1992 Summer Olympics because no bronze medal matches were played in any of the four tournaments.\nMedal table.\n\"Updated after the 8th edition (2020)\"\nMedal distribution.\n\"Updated after the 8th edition (2020)\"\nMedals per year.\n\"Updated after the 8th edition (2020)\""

        "title": "Survivor Series (1987)",
        "text": "The 1987 Survivor Series was the inaugural Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Thanksgiving Night on November 26, 1987, and was held at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio. It was one of the first four annual pay-per-view events produced by the WWF, along with WrestleMania introduced in 1985 and Royal Rumble and SummerSlam introduced in 1988, referred to as the \"Big Four\".\nThe main event was a Survivor Series match where André the Giant's team defeated Hulk Hogan's team when André eliminated Hogan's team member Bam Bam Bigelow to become the first lone survivor in the history of the Survivor Series. The entire undercard featured Survivor Series matches which included Macho Man Randy Savage's team defeating The Honky Tonk Man's team and The Fabulous Moolah's team defeating Sensational Sherri's team. The event also featured a 10 tag team elimination match in which Strike Force and their teammates defeated The Hart Foundation's team.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nFollowing WrestleMania III, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) added an event titled Survivor Series to their pay-per-view (PPV) calendar in November to market the success of Hulk Hogan and André the Giant's rivalry. It was scheduled to be held on Thanksgiving Night on November 26, 1987, and was held at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio. The event was characterized by featuring only tag team elimination matches that were dubbed Survivor Series matches. Of the four matches at the event, three pitted teams of five wrestlers against each other, while the other featured five tag teams against each other (totaling 10 wrestlers per team), but with the stipulation being that if one member of a tag team was eliminated, both members of that particular tag team were eliminated.\nWWF Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Vince McMahon threatened cable companies who aired the National Wrestling Alliance's Starrcade (which was going head-to-head with Survivor Series on Thanksgiving night, 1987) instead of Survivor Series would not be allowed to broadcast WrestleMania IV. Most cable providers gave into McMahon's threat and only a handful aired Starrcade.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into Survivor Series included André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude against Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. In January 1987, Hogan was awarded a trophy for his third year as WWF World Heavyweight Champion while Hogan's best friend André was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's, for being undefeated in WWF for 15 years. Hogan congratulated his friend and said that André was the real champion of superstars all around the world. André surprisingly left the interview before Hogan could even finish. In February, he came with a new manager Bobby Heenan. When Hogan learned of that, he begged André not to keep Heenan as his manager because Heenan was Hogan's longtime enemy. André said that he had come to challenge Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania. He ripped off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden chain, turning heel. This culminated in their historic match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan defeated André to retain the title. On August 22, 1987, edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", Paul Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager when he discovered that Heenan had brought in a new wrestler Rick Rude to replace Orndorff. Orndorff appointed Oliver Humperdink as his manager to feud with Rude. Superstar Billy Graham got involved in a feud with Butch Reed, culminating in a match between the duo. One Man Gang interfered in a match where he hit Graham with a big splash on the concrete floor. Don Muraco came to the rescue of Graham and Graham who was scheduled to participate in the main event of the first-ever Survivor Series retired due to an attack by One Man Gang. Muraco replaced him. Ken Patera got involved in a feud with Bobby Heenan and The Heenan Family and turned babyface, and was chosen to be the fourth member on Hogan's team. Many heel managers wanted to manage Bam Bam Bigelow, but Bigelow chose Oliver Humperdink as his manager thus making his WWF debut as a babyface. He also became a part of Hogan's team.\nRandy Savage had been a heel since his WWF debut in the summer of 1985. He turned babyface in late 1987, after WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Honky Tonk Man claimed to be the greatest Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. This led to a feud between Savage and Honky, leading to Savage's face turn. On October 3, 1987 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XII\", Savage challenged Honky for the title winning by disqualification. The title remained with Honky because a title cannot change hands by a DQ. Harley Race had won the 1986 King of the Ring tournament and was so proud about this that he called himself King Harley Race and wore a crown and cape to the ring. Jim Duggan did not agree with the fact and this placed Duggan and Race into a feud, with Duggan winning most of the matches. Jake Roberts also feuded with Honky Tonk Man after Honky hit Roberts with a guitar on an edition of \"Snake Pit\", completing Roberts' babyface turn. A match was booked for Survivor Series featuring Savage, Roberts, Ricky Steamboat (whom Honky Tonk had defeated to win the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title), Brutus Beefcake and Duggan against Honky, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass and Race.\nThe major ongoing tag team feud pitted the face Strike Force and the villainous Hart Foundation. Tito Santana and Rick Martel formed Strike Force in the summer of 1987 after Santana rescued Martel from a beating by The Islanders. Strike Force quickly became a top contender for the WWF Tag Team Championship, held by the Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), and on October 28, 1987, Strike Force won the titles when Neidhart was trapped in Martel's Boston crab.\nEvent.\nThe first match of the first Survivor Series was the first Survivor Series elimination match. Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, Brutus Beefcake, and Jim Duggan faced WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass, and Harley Race. Savage's team was seconded by his wife Miss Elizabeth while Honky's team was seconded by Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart. Beefcake and Hercules started off before Duggan and Race were tagged in. Duggan knocked Race out of the ring and followed him out where they brawled and both men were counted out and eliminated, leaving four men on each team. Beefcake hit a high knee on Bass, and went on to eliminate him. Team captain Honky himself joined the match and hit his Shake, Rattle and Roll on Beefcake and eliminated him, evening the match at three all. Roberts hit a DDT on Davis and only two men remained in Honky's team, Honky and Hercules. Savage hit the Savage Elbow on Hercules and pinned him, leaving Honky the only member in his team. After being dominated by Savage, Roberts and Steamboat for a couple of minutes, Honky was atomic dropped over the top rope by Savage and ran from the ring with Jimmy Hart and his IC Belt and was counted out. Honky's self-elimination made Savage, Roberts and Steamboat the survivors of the match.\nThe next match was a women's match featuring the team of The Fabulous Moolah, Rockin' Robin, Velvet McIntyre, and The Jumping Bomb Angels (Itsuki Yamazaki and Noriyo Tateno) against WWF Women's Champion Sensational Sherri, WWF Women's Tag Team Champions The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin), Donna Christianello, and Dawn Marie. McIntyre did the first elimination by pinning Christianello with a victory roll. Robin hit a running crossbody on Marie and pinned her with the crossbody, leading to three wrestlers on Sherri's team while none of Moolah's team members had been eliminated. Team captain Sherri came into the match and hit Robin with a vertical suplex to eliminate her. Glamour Girls hit a double clothesline on Moolah and Judy Martin, one half of Glamour Girls pinned Moolah to eliminate her. McIntyre pinned Sherri with a victory roll pin. Leilani Kai joined the match and then pinned McIntyre after an electric chair drop. Yamazaki hit a diving crossbody from the top rope on Kai and pinned her to eliminate her. Tateno hit a flying clothesline on Martin and pinned her to win the match. Jumping Bomb Angels became the survivors for Moolah's team.\nThe third match was a tag team variation of the Survivor Series match with 10 tag teams. If a person from a tag team was eliminated, their partner was also eliminated. The match featured WWF Tag Team Champions Strike Force (Tito Santana and Rick Martel), The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers), The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau), The Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair), and The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) against The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), The Islanders (Haku and Tama), Demolition (Ax and Smash), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov), and The New Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Dino Bravo). Santana hit a flying forearm smash on Zhukov and pinned him to eliminate Bolsheviks for the first elimination of the match. Jacques hit a diving crossbody on Ax but missed the move and was pinned by Ax, eliminating Fabulous Rougeaus. Ax's partner Smash was disqualified, eliminating Demolition. Neidhart pinned Santana to eliminate Strike Force and Haku pinned Dynamite Kid to eliminate British Bulldogs. Next came Roma and Valentine. Roma hit a diving sunset flip on Valentine to eliminate The New Dream Team. Bret Hart and Jim Brunzell were next. Tama dropkicked Hart and then Brunzell rolled over Hart to eliminate Hart Foundation. Brian Blair put on his Killer Bees mask and pinned Tama with a sunset flip to eliminate Islanders. As a results, Young Stallions and Killer Bees won the match and became survivors for their team.\nThe main event was a Survivor Series match where André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed, and Rick Rude faced WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera, and Bam Bam Bigelow. Muraco was not scheduled to compete in the match but replaced Billy Graham, who was originally scheduled to be Hogan's teammate but retired because of his hip injury suffered during a match against Reed. Hogan eliminated Reed after he hit a leg drop on Reed and pinned him to eliminate him first. Patera was eliminated after falling victim to One Man Gang's Flying Clothesline. Thereafter, Orndorff (who had recently turned face) and Rude began brawling to advance their feud over who had the better physique; Orndorff gotten the best of Rude until Bundy distracted him, allowing Rude to use a roll up to score the pin. Muraco (who had also recently turned face) joined the match and powerslammed Rude to eliminate him. One Man Gang entered and then hit Muraco with a 747 Splash to eliminate him, giving André's team a three–two advantage. One Mang Gang and Bundy began dominating Bigelow, when André was tagged in to go for the kill. However, Bigelow ducked an André punch and tagged in Hogan. Hogan immediately began getting the better of André and was setting up for a running elbow smash, when he was pulled out of the ring by Bundy; Hogan fought off both heels but was kept out of the ring long enough to be counted out. Hogan re-entered the ring to argue with the referees, but ring announcer Howard Finkel informed the crowd that if Hogan did not leave the ring immediately, Andre's team would win the match automatically. Bigelow—the lone remaining member of Hogan's team—fended for himself, using a Slingshot to eliminate Bundy, then pinning One Man Gang after he missed a 747 Splash. Bigelow eventually fell victim to André, who hit a butterfly suplex to win the match. After the match, Hogan returned to the ring and attacked André, hitting him with his title belt and knocking him from the ring.\nAftermath.\nHulk Hogan and André the Giant engaged in a war of words over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship during the following months, with the feud taking on a new level when Ted DiBiase – who was Hogan's primary challenger at the time – announced he planned to offer Hogan a cash buyout in exchange for the title, which Hogan emphatically refused. With fan anticipation of a Hogan-André rematch, André sneak attacked Hogan on \"Saturday Night's Main Event XIII\", choking the champion until he was virtually unconscious, and shortly thereafter, DiBiase announced his alignment with André to help him win the championship. At the first Royal Rumble supercard on January 24, 1988, Hogan and André signed a contract for a WrestleMania III rematch. Their WWF title rematch took place on \"The Main Event I\" on February 5, 1988, where André controversially defeated Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, his reign was short lived. In fact, he was the shortest reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion in history as his reign lasted even less than a minute as he sold the title to DiBiase. WWF President Jack Tunney immediately vacated the title and it was decided in a 14-man tournament at WrestleMania IV, with the winner winning the vacant title. With help from former champion Hogan, Randy Savage defeated DiBiase in the finals of the tournament to win the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\nBigger things lay ahead for several other competitors, including Savage, the Honky Tonk Man and the tag team Demolition:\nA second Survivor Series occurred the following year, establishing the event as an annual November pay-per-view, becoming one of the WWF's original four annual pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were eventually referred to as the \"Big Four\". From 1993 to 2002, these four were referred to as the \"Big Five\" along with King of the Ring, but that event was discontinued after its 2002 event. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the \"Big Five\". Survivor Series has since become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WrestleMania). Since the inaugural event, Survivor Series has been characterized for featuring Survivor Series matches, typically pitting teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Although there was a women's Survivor Series match in 1987, the second such contest did not occur until the 1995 event. Before 2022, there have been only two instances in which a Survivor Series match did not occur at the titular event—the 1998 event and 2002 event. Those events, however, instead had a different type of elimination match; 1998 had an entire 14-man single elimination tournament, while 2002 saw the first-ever Elimination Chamber match in addition to an elimination tables match and a triple threat elimination tag team match. From 2016 until 2021, Survivor Series was based on competition between WWE's brands, which is the term for WWE's roster division in which the promotion assigns wrestlers to exclusively perform for one of their brands. From 2022 onwards, Survivor Series carries the WarGames concept."

He was selected in the first round of the 1998 NFL draft, and he played professionally for the Seattle Seahawks, and briefly, the New Orleans Saints of the NFL.\nEarly years.\nSimmons was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. He attended Spartanburg High School, where he played for the Spartanburg Vikings high school football team and helped lead the Vikings to their first of three consecutive state championships.\nCollege career.\nSimmons attended Clemson University, and played for the Clemson Tigers football team. As a freshman in 1995, Simmons earned the starting job at inside linebacker after just five days of practice. He finished the season with 150 tackles, and became the first defensive player ever to be named UPI's national freshman of the year, and received first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) honors. As a sophomore, he set the Tigers' record for tackles in a season (178) en route to being named an All-American, and earning another first-team All-ACC selection.\nSimmons became one of the premier players in the nation as a junior, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American.

        "text": "The 1988 Survivor Series was the second annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on November 24, 1988, (Thanksgiving night in the United States) at the Richfield Coliseum, in Richfield Township, Ohio for the second consecutive year. Four matches were contested at the event.\nThe main event was a ten-man Survivor Series match between a team captained by The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion Macho Man Randy Savage) and a team captained by The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man). Hogan and Savage were the survivors of the match. The undercard consisted of three further Survivor Series matches.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nIn 1987, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) debuted a pay-per-view (PPV) titled Survivor Series. The event was characterized by featuring only tag team elimination matches that were dubbed Survivor Series matches. Of the four matches at the inaugural event, three pitted teams of five wrestlers against each other, while the other featured five tag teams against each other (totaling 10 wrestlers per team), but with the stipulation being that if one member of a tag team was eliminated, both members of that particular tag team were eliminated. The 1988 event followed suit and featured the same four match types that filled the card. It was the second event in the Survivor Series chronology, establishing it as an annual November event, becoming one of the promotions original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has also since become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania). The 1988 Survivor Series was scheduled to be held on November 24, 1988, (Thanksgiving night in the United States) at the Richfield Coliseum, in Richfield Township, Ohio.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into Survivor Series pitted The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage), Hercules, Koko B. Ware, and Hillbilly Jim against The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man), Ted DiBiase, Haku, and The Red Rooster. Hogan and Savage formed this alliance at WrestleMania IV in March 1988 after Hogan helped Savage in defeating DiBiase in the tournament final for the vacant WWF Championship. DiBiase and André the Giant faced Hogan and Savage at the inaugural SummerSlam in August where the Mega Powers won. DiBiase had bought the contract of André from Heenan at the inaugural Royal Rumble in January. In late 1988, DiBiase bought another contract from Heenan, that of Hercules, who was a powerful force in the WWF. Hercules refused to become DiBiase's slave and turned babyface and started feuding with DiBiase. DiBiase and other heel wrestlers joined The Twin Towers against Hercules, The Mega Powers and other babyface wrestlers.\nAnother major feud pitted Jake Roberts against André the Giant. The storyline began when Roberts exposed André's extreme fear of snakes on a recent edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XII\". Roberts had thrown his snake, Damien, on the frightened André, who suffered a mild (kayfabe) heart attack. André vowed revenge, but Roberts constantly used Damien—either in their matches or by coming to the ring with a sack containing the snake during André's matches against other wrestlers—to gain a psychological edge.\nThe major tag team feud pitted WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition against The Powers of Pain, two teams known for their use of face paint and power brawling style of wrestling. The Powers, previously heels in Jim Crockett Promotions, had been brought into the WWF as babyface mercenaries by previous champions Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana) to avenge both their title loss to Demolition at WrestleMania IV and an injury Demolition had inflicted on Martel back in June. The other main feud pitted WWF Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. The Honky Tonk Man, the former champion who was determined to regain his title.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match of the event was a five-on-five Survivor Series match between the team of WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior, Brutus Beefcake, Sam Houston, The Blue Blazer (in his pay-per-view (PPV) debut), and Jim Brunzell; and the team of The Honky Tonk Man, Ron Bass, Danny Davis, Greg Valentine, and Bad News Brown; as such, this match was mainly among Intercontinental Championship contenders, and low- to mid-card wrestlers. Don Muraco was originally scheduled to be a part of Warrior's team but left the WWF, so he was replaced by Jim Brunzell. Beefcake scored the first victory of the night for Warrior's team, using a sleeper hold to force Davis to submit at the 1:18 mark. Brown evened the odds for the heel team about four minutes later, hitting Brunzell with a Ghetto Blaster, a type of kick to the back of the head. Not long thereafter, Valentine and Brown were setting Houston up for a double-team move when Houston dodged a running forearm club by Valentine, who instead struck Brown. Brown—playing up his character as an uncooperative loner—was angered and walked out of the match, getting himself counted out. Bass pinned Houston after a running powerslam, evening the sides at 3-apiece. The Blue Blazer used his speed to daze Valentine, but while attempting to finish the veteran Valentine off with a top-rope move, Honky ran over and pushed Blazer off the ropes; Valentine quickly applied a figure four leglock to force the submission. Beefcake then got the upper hand over Honky and locked on the sleeper hold, but Honky got to and slipped through the ropes, taking Beefcake with him; both men were ultimately counted out, leaving Warrior as the lone member of his team. Bass and Valentine worked over Warrior for a while, but Warrior dodged a double-clothesline attempt and knocked both men down, quickly pinning both men back-to-back—first Bass, then Valentine—with double axe handles to win the match and be the sole survivor.\nThe second Survivor Series match was a 10-on-10 variation of tag teams, in which if a wrestler from a tag team was eliminated, his partner was also eliminated. The match pitted the Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian), The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid), The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), and The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers) against WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov), The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques Rougeau and Raymond Rougeau) and The Conquistadors. Hart pinned Raymond with a small package, eliminating The Fabulous Rougeaus from the match. Zhukov hit a reverse diving crossbody on Powers and pinned him to eliminate The Young Stallions but shortly after, he was pinned by Jannetty with a sunset flip, thus eliminating The Bolsheviks from the match. Hart hit a German suplex on Blanchard but the referee saw his shoulders down, so he counted the pinfall eliminating The Hart Foundation. The Rockers began brawling with Blanchard and his partner Anderson. The Rockers and the Brain Busters were both disqualified due to brawling in the ring and were eliminated. Dynamite hit Smash on the mat and went to the top rope. He tried to hit a diving headbutt but Smash got up and clotheslined him and then pinned him to eliminate the British Bulldogs. Initially, Smash was unable to handle the powerful Barbarian of the Powers of Pain, but Demolition eventually gained the advantage when Ax moved out of the way of a charging Warlord, who injured his shoulder on the steel corner post of the ring. Both Demolition members took turns to work on Warlord's injured shoulder until the Powers of Pain looked ripe to be defeated. However, at this point Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji opened the rope causing his own man Smash to fall from the ring and get counted out, thus eliminating Demolition. Afterward, Ax confronted Fuji who denied everything, but when Ax shoved him off and turned his back in disgust, a fuming Fuji struck him with his cane from behind. The sufficiently recovered Smash, who had been watching all this, collared the manager and threw him to Ax, who slammed him to the ringside mat, causing Demolition to turn babyface. After Demolition strode away to cheers from the crowd, The Powers of Pain momentarily resumed the match with the Conquistadors, but then they suddenly ceased and stepped out of the ring and turned heels when they picked Fuji up off the floor, dusted him down and guided him round to their corner. Moments later Fuji tripped Conquistador #1 with his cane, allowing the Barbarian to hit the masked man with a diving headbutt and pin him to eliminate The Conquistadors, making the Powers of Pain the survivors. After the match, Demolition ran back to the ring and ran Warlord and Barbarian from the ring.\nIn the third Survivor Series match André the Giant, Rick Rude, Dino Bravo, Mr. Perfect and Harley Race fought against Jim Duggan, Jake Roberts, Scott Casey, Ken Patera and Tito Santana. Junkyard Dog was originally scheduled to be a part of Roberts' team but left WWF. B. Brian Blair replaced the Junkyard Dog to be a part of the team but he also left WWF, so he was replaced by Scott Casey. Rude hit Patera with a Rude Awakening at 8:18 mark and pinned Patera to eliminate him, leaving Roberts' team with 4 members. A minute later, André's team member Bravo hit Casey with a side suplex and pinned Casey to eliminate him. Roberts' team was left with only three members while André's team had still five members. However, Santana hit Race with a flying forearm smash and then pinned him to eliminate Race, leaving André's team with 4 members. Heel team captain André came in and quickly used his massive height and weight to crush and eventually pin Santana, leaving the heels with a 4–2 advantage. Later, Duggan used his 2×4 on Bravo, getting disqualified in the process. Roberts, the only member left on the face team, held his own and when Rude cockily attempted to tag one of his partners into the ring, he caught Rude from behind and hit with a DDT, eliminating him. André quickly got into the ring, applied a chokehold on Roberts and refused to release it, getting disqualified in the process. Before André left, he headbutted Roberts. Perfect took advantage and pinned Roberts to win the match. Perfect and Bravo became the survivors for their team. After the match, Roberts recovered, retrieved Damien and chased Andre, Perfect and Bravo from ringside.\nMain event.\nIn the main event The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage), Hercules, Koko B. Ware and Hillbilly Jim squared off against The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man), Ted DiBiase, Haku and The Red Rooster. Savage hit a Savage Elbow on Rooster to pin and eliminate him, giving the Mega Powers an early edge. The big Akeem quickly evened the two sides after overpowering Hillbilly Jim and striking him with the Air Africa splash for the pin. Akeem's partner Boss Man hit Koko with a Boss Man Slam to give the Twin Towers a 4–3 advantage. DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil distracted Hercules, allowing DiBiase to pin him with a schoolboy, leaving just team captains Hogan and Savage in the Mega Powers' corner. As DiBiase was taunting Hercules, Savage immediately pinned him with a schoolboy to eliminate him, leaving three members in Twin Towers' corner. Shortly thereafter, Slick (the manager of the Twin Towers) grabbed Elizabeth and—while pulling her away from ringside—began screaming threats at her, prompting Hogan to come to her rescue; Akeem and Boss Man intervened, hitting Hogan before Boss Man handcuffed Hogan to the ropes. In the process, Boss Man (the legal man in the ring) was counted out while Akeem was disqualified for shoving the referee and illegally double-teaming Savage. Haku, left as the only member of the heel team, dominated Savage for several minutes as Slick (who remained at ringside) taunted both Hogan and Elizabeth. Eventually, Haku accidentally kicked Slick from the ring apron (after a mistimed illegal double team on Savage) while Hogan clotheslined Heenan. After Elizabeth grabbed the key to unlock his handcuffs, Hogan was tagged into the match after Haku kicked an exhausted Savage into his corner. Hogan quickly dominated Haku and pinned him with a leg drop to score the win for the Mega Powers. After the match, Hogan began acting friendly toward Elizabeth, clearly upsetting Savage, whose reaction was known to the crowd and television audience but not acknowledged by Hogan; pro-heel color commentator Jesse Ventura also picked up on this and interviewed Savage later about the incident.\nAftermath.\nThe Mega Powers were a powerful tag team throughout 1988 but their domination began to end as misunderstanding occurred between Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage in early 1989. This all began on January 7, 1989 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XIX\", Hogan was mercilessly beaten by The Twin Towers after his match with Akeem. Savage came out and cleared the ring with a steel chair. Elizabeth took Hogan to the backstage area which angered Savage. He thought that he was a third wheel and this was the beginning of the breakup of Mega Powers as Savage was angry as to why Miss Elizabeth was used by Hogan as his manager. He confronted her about the issue but she took Hogan backstage. Problems increased further in the Royal Rumble match where Hogan accidentally eliminated Savage as he was trying to eliminate Bad News Brown. On February 3 \"The Main Event II\", Hogan and Savage faced The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man) in a tag team match, filled with controversy. During the climax of the match, Akeem threw Savage on top of Elizabeth, knocking her out cold. Hogan picked her up and took her backstage, leaving Savage alone to face the Towers while Hogan tended to Elizabeth. When Hogan came back, Savage slapped him in the face and took the belt in his hand and turned heel by abandoning Hogan. Though, Hogan managed to pick up the win. Mega Powers disbanded as Hogan and Savage feuded with each other. At WrestleMania V, Hogan defeated Savage in a match that was billed \"The Mega Powers Explode\" to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship ending Savage's reign of 371 days.\nThe feud between Demolition and the Powers of Pain took on its new twist, as now Demolition was the face team and the Powers of Pain were the villains. Mr. Fuji constantly interfered in his team's matches against Demolition, and eventually, a 2-on-3 match was signed for WrestleMania V, with Fuji joining the Powers of Pain. At WrestleMania, Demolition was able to gain their final revenge on Fuji when—after his mistimed attempt to throw salt in Smash's eyes—he was caught in Demolition's finishing move, the Demolition Decapitation.\nThe other feud that continued to headline was Jake Roberts vs. André the Giant, who continued to feud until WrestleMania V, by which time the returning Big John Studd (now competing as a face) had involved himself in the feud by being the guest referee for the André-Roberts match. Prior to that, at the 1989 Royal Rumble, André immediately attacked Roberts when the latter entered the ring during the main event, choking Roberts to the brink of unconsciousness before throwing him out; Roberts recovered within 10 minutes, retrieved his snake, Damien, and scared André from the ring.\nFollowing Survivor Series, Rick Rude began targeting The Ultimate Warrior for his WWF Intercontinental Championship, badgering him into a posedown at the Royal Rumble. The Honky Tonk Man, meanwhile, continued to be unsuccessful against the Warrior (in a bid to regain the title) and, shortly after their last match aired on \"Saturday Night's Main Event XIX\", began losing his push and was demoted to mid-card matches.\nDanny Davis would return to refereeing in 1989 on a \"probationary basis\" after his nearly two-year run as a wrestler, and would continue in that capacity until 1995. The Rockers' and Brain Busters' feud would continue both on WWF TV and the house show circuit through the end of 1988 into 1989. This was Ken Patera's final appearance for the WWF.\nFor The British Bulldogs, this was their last appearance in the WWF as a tag team; the Dynamite Kid was gone for good, while Davey Boy Smith would return in 1991 as a singles competitor known as \"The British Bulldog.\" They left, in part, shortly after a series of practical jokes and altercations with The Rougeau Brothers got out of hand, culminating in Jacques Rougeau knocking several of Dynamite's teeth out with a sucker punch shortly before Survivor Series."

        "text": "The 1989 Survivor Series was the third annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Thanksgiving Day on November 23, 1989, at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois.\nThe main event was a four-on-four Survivor Series match in which The Hulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, Jake Roberts and Demolition) defeated The Million Dollar Team (Ted DiBiase, Zeus and The Powers of Pain). This was the first Survivor Series event with named teams and of four (instead of five) members.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". Like the previous two years, the third event in the Survivor Series chronology only featured Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches. While those two previous events had included three matches that pitted teams of five wrestlers against each other and one that pitted five tag teams against each other, all five of the Survivor Series matches at the 1989 event were teams of four wrestlers against each other. It was scheduled to be held on Thanksgiving Day on November 23, 1989, at the Rosemont Horizon in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois.\nStorylines.\nA major feud heading into Survivor Series was between The Ultimate Warriors (WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Ultimate Warrior and The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) and Jim Neidhart vs. The Heenan Family, The Colossal Connection (André the Giant and Haku) and The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard). Bobby Heenan was a very popular heel manager, who led many heel wrestlers to championship victories in the WWF and his clients feuded with all babyface wrestlers. Ultimate Warrior had been placed in a feud with Heenan's client Rick Rude which began at Royal Rumble when Warrior won by fan reaction over Rude in a posedown. Rude followed by attacking him. They feuded with each other until the summer of the year, in which they exchanged the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship with each other. The Rockers were in a feud with Brain Busters, that had also begun since the beginning of the year. The feud began on January 30, 1989 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\" where The Brain Busters faced The Rockers. In the match, The Brain Busters narrowly defeated the Rockers as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The Rockers and The Brain Busters faced each other in a rematch on March 11 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XX\" which resulted in a double countout. They were added to the main event of Survivor Series in opposing teams.\nDusty Rhodes began a feud with Big Boss Man in mid-1989, when Rhodes came to the aid of a preliminary wrestler during the July 22nd episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" (taped June 28), stealing the Big Boss Man's nightstick and handcuffs in the process. Later in the same episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", Rhodes was a guest on \"The Brother Love Show\", where he proclaimed that \"no one was afraid of the Boss Man anymore.\" Rhodes captained the Dream Team, while the Big Boss Man captained The Enforcers. Akeem, one half of The Twin Towers, defeated Brutus Beefcake in a King of the Ring tournament qualifying match on October 14, leading to a feud between Beefcake and Akeem. Beefcake joined Dusty's Dream Team while Akeem was scheduled to be a member of Enforcers. Tito Santana and Rick Martel, former Strike Force teammates had been feuding with each other since WrestleMania V, where Martel turned heel by abandoning Santana during their match against Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard). At SummerSlam, Martel and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) defeated Santana and The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty). Martel became a member of The Enforcers while Santana was added to The Dream Team. The Honky Tonk Man and The Red Rooster wrestled a series of house show matches in the fall of 1989, with Honky winning most of these encounters. Honky was added to The Enforcers, while the Red Rooster joined The Dream Team.\nRandy Savage turned heel in early 1989, breaking up The Mega Powers. He defeated Jim Duggan later that same year to win the title of \"King of Wrestling\", beginning a feud between Duggan and himself. Greg Valentine and Ronnie Garvin had been feuding since a match on December 30, 1988 in Madison Square Garden (MSG) which Valentine won by grabbing the tights for leverage. On April 22, 1989 episode of \"Superstars\", Garvin defeated Valentine in a match. On the following edition of \"Superstars\", they both faced each other in a retirement match in which the loser could not wrestle anymore in WWF. Valentine won the match, sending Garvin into retirement. Garvin became a referee for the WWF. During this time, he punched several wrestlers who physically provoked him, including Valentine in the course of his match against Jimmy Snuka, and he was suspended after the match. Valentine was also involved in a feud with Hercules, which culminated at SummerSlam where Valentine defeated Hercules by pinning him using the ropes for leverage. Garvin was the guest ring announcer for the match, and not only did he verbally mock Valentine during the introduction, but he also announced Hercules as the winner by disqualification. Valentine was so furious that he demanded Garvin be reinstated as a professional wrestler, and his request was accepted. Garvin and Hercules were included as members of 4x4s at Survivor Series, and Valentine was added as a member of King's Court. Dino Bravo was involved in a feud with Bret Hart. At Royal Rumble, Jim Duggan, Hart and Jim Neidhart defeated Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeaus in a two out of three falls match, so Bravo became a member of King's Court at Survivor Series and Hart became a member of 4x4s.\nHulk Hogan starred in the WWF-financed professional-wrestling movie \"No Holds Barred\" as the protagonist, Rip. Tommy Lister Jr. portrayed Rip's arch rival Zeus in the movie, who is defeated by Rip. It turned out into a rivalry that took place in the WWF. Lister was billed as Zeus, who wanted to take revenge of the movie from Hogan in real-life. He debuted on May 27, 1989 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXI\" before Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship title defense against Big Boss Man in a steel cage. Boss Man's manager Slick introduced him. Zeus attacked Hogan during Hogan's entrance. The feud culminated at SummerSlam where Hogan and Brutus Beefcake defeated Randy Savage and Zeus. Zeus was scheduled to become a part of Million $ Team against Hogan's Hulkamaniacs team at Survivor Series. At WrestleMania V, Ted DiBiase attempted to steal Jake Roberts' snake Damien during Roberts' match against André the Giant beginning a rivalry between Roberts and DiBiase. Roberts defeated DiBiase's manager Virgil on \"Superstars\" but after the match, DiBiase injured him and sidelined him for months. Roberts returned in late 1989 and signed to become a part of Hogan's Hulkamaniacs team against DiBiase's Million $ Team. Demolition (Ax and Smash) were pushed as a heel tag team in the WWF in 1988 under the tutelage of Mr. Fuji. A stronger and powerful babyface tag team The Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian) debuted in the summer of 1988 and challenged Demolition for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, Fuji caused Demolition to get eliminated in a Survivor Series match resulting in a double turn as Powers of Pain turned heels and Demolition turned babyfaces. At WrestleMania V, Demolition defeated Powers of Pain and Mr. Fuji in a handicap match to retain the tag titles, culminating in Demolition joining Hulkamaniacs at Survivor Series and Powers of Pain joining Million $ Team in Survivor Series.\nAt SummerSlam, Roddy Piper interfered in Rick Rude's WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship title defense against Ultimate Warrior and distracted Rude, causing Rude to lose the title to Warrior. This led to Rude and Piper captaining teams against each other at Survivor Series. Rude's team was dubbed \"Rude Brood,\" and Piper's team was dubbed \"Roddy's Rowdies\". Jimmy Snuka became a part of Rowdy's Rowdies and Mr. Perfect became a part of Rude Brood. The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Butch and Bushwhacker Luke) feuded with The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques Rougeau and Raymond Rougeau) in early 1989. This led to their WrestleMania V encounter where Bushwhackers won, leading to Bushwhackers joining Roddy's Rowdies and Rougeaus joining Rude Brood.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, Boris Zhukov defeated Paul Roma in a dark match. The opening included superstars expressing what they were thankful for, followed by a rundown of the card narrated by Vince McMahon. The first Survivor Series match was between The Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, The Red Rooster and Tito Santana) and The Enforcers (Big Boss Man, Bad News Brown, Rick Martel and The Honky Tonk Man). Originally, Boss Man's tag team The Twin Towers partner Akeem was scheduled to be a part of The Enforcers but was replaced by Brown. Rick Martel and Tito Santana, two former Strike Force partners and current rivals began the match. Martel pinned Santana with a roll-up, eliminating Santana, leaving Dream Team with three members. Sapphire made another appearance in the audience, after appearing the previous week on TV cheering on Dusty Rhodes in a match against Akeem. Like the previous year, Bad News Brown walked out on his team after arguing with team captain Big Boss Man and getting counted out. Both teams continued with three members each until Brutus Beefcake pinned Honky Tonk Man after a high knee, eliminating Honky and leaving Enforcers with only two members – Boss Man and Martel. Martel entered but failed to eliminate Beefcake. Instead, Beefcake pinned Martel with a roll-up, eliminating him and leaving Enforcers' captain Boss Man as the remaining member. He managed to pin Red Rooster after a Boss Man Slam. He fought the opposing Dream Team's captain Dusty Rhodes. The two captains had a battle with each other, which Rhodes won after he pinned Boss Man with a flying crossbody. Dream Team won with Rhodes and Beefcake as the survivors.\nThe second Survivor Series match was between The King's Court (Randy Savage, Canadian Earthquake, Dino Bravo and Greg Valentine) and 4x4s (Jim Duggan, Bret Hart, Ronnie Garvin and Hercules). Canadian Earthquake was a replacement for The Widowmaker, after Windham left the company in October due to his family’s involvement in a counterfeit scandal. Hercules and Earthquake began the match. Earthquake hit Hercules an Earthquake Splash and pinned Hercules to eliminate him, leaving 4x4s with three members. Greg Valentine came next against the team captain of the 4x4s, Jim Duggan. Duggan used his bigger size on Valentine and hit him with a three-point stance charging clothesline and pinned Valentine to eliminate him, leaving King's Court with three members too. Dino Bravo brawled with Ronnie Garvin. Bravo hit Garvin a side slam and pinned Garvin to eliminate him, leaving 4x4s with two members – Duggan and Bret Hart. Hart used his high-flying ability but fell victim to a Savage Elbow by opposing team King's Court captain Randy Savage. Savage followed by pinning Hart and eliminating him, leaving 4x4s with their captain Duggan. Duggan was able to fend by himself against King's Court, who were all three. Savage's valet Queen Sherri interfered which distracted Duggan. Duggan went to the outside to chase her and got counted out. King's Court won the match with Savage, Earthquake, and Bravo as the survivors. After the match, Duggan grabbed his 2x4 and attacked Savage, Earthquake and Bravo with it.\nThe main event was a third Survivor Series match between The Hulkamaniacs (WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) and Jake Roberts and Million Dollar Team Ted DiBiase, Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian) and Zeus. Zeus shoved the referee at the 3:21 minute mark, so he was disqualified and got eliminated, leaving Million Dollar Team with three members. Ax and Warlord battled each other. Ax dominated Warlord until Powers of Pain's manager Mr. Fuji distracted him. Warlord took advantage and pinned Ax to eliminate him, leaving Hulkamaniacs with three members to even the score. Ax's Demolition partner Smash entered the match and battled it out with Warlord's Powers of Pain partner Barbarian. Smash tried to take revenge of Ax's elimination from Barbarian but was pinned after a flying clothesline, getting eliminated and leaving Hulkamaniacs with two members – Jake Roberts and Hulk Hogan. Warlord and Barbarian double-teamed Hogan, so they were disqualified and eliminated, leaving Million Dollar Team's captain Ted DiBiase as the only member remaining in the match. Roberts got the upper hand on DiBiase until DiBiase's manager Virgil distracted Roberts. With his feet on the ropes for leverage, DiBiase pinned and eliminated Roberts. It all came down to the team captains, with Hogan hitting a leg drop on DiBiase, pinning him to win the match and become the sole survivor for his team.\nThe fourth Survivor Series match was between The Rude Brood (Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) and Roddy's Rowdies (Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Butch and Bushwhacker Luke). The high-flying Jimmy Snuka and Jacques Rougeau began the match with Snuka eliminating Jacques with a Superfly Splash, leaving The Rude Brood with three members. Jacques' brother and Fabulous Rougeaus partner Raymond battled opposing team captain Roddy Piper. Piper hit Raymond with a piledriver and pinned Raymond to eliminate him, leaving Rude Brood with only two members – Mr. Perfect and team captain Rick Rude. Perfect had been pushed as an undefeated wrestler since joining WWF in 1988. He pinned Bushwhacker Butch with a roll-up to eliminate him, leaving Rowdy's Rowdies with three members. Butch's Bushwhackers partner Bushwhacker Luke battled Rude, but unluckily was hit with a Rude Awakening and got pinned, getting eliminated and leaving Rowdy's Rowdies with two members. With both teams down to two members captains Rude and Piper battled each other until both were counted-out, leaving only Perfect from The Rude Brood and Snuka from Roddy's Rowdies. Snuka used his high-flying techniques on Perfect but was unable to pin him. Perfect hit Snuka a Perfectplex to win the match and become the sole survivor for The Rude Brood.\nThe fifth Survivor Series match was between The Ultimate Warriors (WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) and Jim Neidhart) and The Heenan Family (manager Bobby Heenan, The Colossal Connection (André the Giant and Haku) and Arn Anderson). Arn Anderson's Brain Busters partner Tully Blanchard was originally scheduled to be a part of The Heenan Family but was fired from the WWF on November 1 for failing a drug test. He was replaced by Bobby Heenan. At first, only Neidhart, Jannetty and Michaels were introduced for the face team, and as soon as the Rockers entered the ring, Neidhart attacked Heenan while Michaels and Jannetty went after Anderson and Haku. André went after the faces, attacking at will until Warrior ran out, jumped into the ring and, after sending him reeling with a series of clotheslines, knocked André to the floor. André was counted out at the 26-second mark, giving the Warrior's team a quick 4-3 advantage. Later, Neidhart and Anderson were brawling when, after Anderson was knocked to the floor, Haku snuck up from behind and struck Neidhart with a thrust kick to score the pin. Anderson and Haku used a series of double-team moves to wear down Janetty, and eventually, Heenan was tagged in to score the easy pin and give the Heenan Family a 3-2 edge. After Haku missed with a flying crossbody, Michaels used a crossbody of his own to pin Haku. At this point, Anderson began showing signs of frustration with Heenan but was still able to eliminate Michaels after hitting him with a Spinebuster. Anderson held a short-lived advantage over Warrior, but the beginning of the end for the heels came when Warrior whipped Anderson into Heenan (who was standing on the apron), knocking the latter to the floor. Warrior pinned Anderson after hitting him with a gorilla press drop–big splash combination. As Heenan began regaining his senses and arguing with Anderson, thinking him to be walking out on the match, Warrior snuck around ringside and snuck up on Heenan, who realized what had happened. Warrior grabbed Heenan, whipped him across the ring and after knocking him down with a shoulder tackle, hit him with a big splash to score the pin and become the sole survivor for his team. Warrior, after briefly posing in the ring with his Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt, knocked down a groggy Heenan in the aisle, shortly before the pay-per-view signed off.\nAftermath.\nThe main event confrontation between Hulk Hogan and Zeus was set up for a special late-December pay-per-view event called \"\", in which actor Tommy Lister – in his \"Zeus\" character – was paired with Randy Savage (his tag-team partner from SummerSlam 1989) and Hogan and Brutus \"the Barber\" Beefcake were reunited for a special tag team steel cage match, which Hogan and Beefcake won.\nArn Anderson's and Tully Blanchard's final WWF appearance would be the following Saturday (November 25, 1989, taped October 31, 1989) on Saturday Night's Main Event in a best two out of three falls match against The Rockers. Heenan \"fired\" his team for not following his direction and left ringside while Anderson/Blanchard lost their match. Due to the failed drug test, WCW did not hire Blanchard but did bring Anderson back and appeared on WCW television two weeks after his final WWF appearance.\nThe Ultimate Warrior was successful in the WWF's mid-card division in 1989, so his match at Survivor Series was run last to give the event a Warrior-themed ending, although Hogan's match was promoted as the main event contest. The biggest match of Warrior's career was at WrestleMania VI where he defeated Hulk Hogan to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a title vs. title match in which Warrior's WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship was also on the line.\nAndré the Giant and Haku had teamed together occasionally prior to the 1989 Survivor Series as members of the Heenan Family, but this was their first high-profile match as a tag team. After Survivor Series, the two formally formed a tag team known as The Colossal Connection, in part to fill a void in the Heenan Family left by the imminent departure of Anderson and Blanchard, but also to prolong the ailing Andre's career – the effects of his real-life acromegaly were starting to take their toll – by including him in a team in which the younger, healthy Haku would handle most of the wrestling. On December 13, 1989, André and Haku would win the WWF Tag Team Championship by defeating Demolition at a television taping in Huntsville, Alabama, and would hold on to the titles until Demolition gained revenge at WrestleMania VI, defeating The Colossal Connection and setting in motion André's face turn in what was the final WWF match of his career."

        "text": "The 1990 Survivor Series was the fourth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Thanksgiving Day on November 22, 1990, at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut. Seven matches were contested at the event, including one dark match before the live broadcast.\nThis event is well known for the on-screen debut of The Undertaker, who would become one of the most prolific figures within the company. In addition, Sgt. Slaughter, who then portrayed an Iraqi sympathizer, insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for Thanksgiving during Operation Desert Shield. In an interview, Randy Savage challenged The Ultimate Warrior for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Haku replaced Rick Rude, who had left the WWF over a pay dispute. In the storyline, he was suspended by WWF President Jack Tunney for insulting the mother of the Big Boss Man. Boris Zhukov replaced Akeem who had left the WWF in October.\nThe Undertaker would wrestle for the WWF (renamed to WWE in 2002) for the next 30 years, setting a company record for longevity. His retirement ceremony took place at the 2020 Survivor Series, exactly 30 years later.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". Continuing the tradition of the previous years' events, the fourth event in the Survivor Series chronology only featured Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches. The event was scheduled to be held on Thanksgiving Day on November 22, 1990, at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut.\nStorylines.\nThe card included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, in which wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, with storylines produced on their weekly television shows.\nAftermath.\nCrowd reaction to The Gobbledy Gooker was extremely negative, with fans loudly booing as the costumed Héctor Guerrero danced in the ring with announcer Gene Okerlund. Although the character made a handful of appearances in taped promos following the Survivor Series, the Gobbledy Gooker soon disappeared and was not mentioned again until the Gimmick Battle Royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. Several years later, WrestleCrap used the name for its \"Gooker Award\", presented for the worst gimmicks, storylines, or events in wrestling.\nSgt. Slaughter and Randy Savage both challenged the Ultimate Warrior for the WWF Championship. Slaughter and his manager, General Adnan, also cut several anti-American, pro-Iraqi promos – all airing at a time when the United States was engaged in Operation Desert Shield, all to build up heat for his match against Warrior at the 1991 Royal Rumble, held two days after the start of the war against Iraq. Slaughter – with help from both Savage and his manager, Sensational Sherri – won the title from Warrior at the Royal Rumble. Warrior defeated Savage in a career-ending match at Wrestlemania VII after which Savage turned face and reunited with former manager Miss Elizabeth, ultimately winning back the belt a year later at Wrestlemania VIII. Savage and Warrior fought one more time for the title at SummerSlam (1992) in a match plagued by interference from Ric Flair and Mr Perfect.\nHogan went on to focus on wrapping up his feud with Earthquake with a series of stretcher matches, which Hogan won, before going on to challenge Slaughter for the WWF title.\nSince the formation of Demolition in 1987, they had been compared to the Legion of Doom (LOD). The feud between the LOD and Demolition (which by now was Crush and Smash) continued to rage into the end of 1990, with LOD eventually proving decisively they were the better team. (In part, the feud had not had the anticipated intensity because of Ax's reduced role in the tag team due to health problems.) Demolition's last pay-per-view appearance was at WrestleMania VII, where the team lost to Genichiro Tenryu and Koji Kitao. LOD eventually became WWF Tag Team Champions.\nThe Undertaker quickly got over with fans as he easily handled lower-card competition during his first months in the WWF. He started his first main-event feud with The Ultimate Warrior shortly after WrestleMania VII. The Undertaker would wrestle for the WWF (renamed to WWE in 2002) for the next 30 years, setting a company record for longevity. He would become one of their most important and beloved stars, eventually reaching iconic status. His retirement ceremony took place at the 2020 Survivor Series, exactly 30 years later, and headlined the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2022."

It took place on Thanksgiving Eve on November 27, 1991, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. It was the first Survivor Series to feature a singles match of any kind, which served as the main event in which The Undertaker defeated Hulk Hogan to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\nThe undercard featured four traditional Survivor Series elimination matches.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches. The 1991 event was the fifth event in the Survivor Series chronology. It was the first event in which all of the matches were not scheduled as Survivor Series matches. The event included four Survivor Series matches. The only non-Survivor Series match on the card was for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which was the first time it was defended at a Survivor Series. The event was scheduled to be held on Thanksgiving Eve on November 27, 1991, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nStorylines.\nThe main event heading into the event was between World Wrestling Federation Champion Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker for the World Wrestling Federation Championship. \nHogan reclaimed the World Wrestling Federation Championship at Wrestlemania 7. The Undertaker debuted in the World Wrestling Federation at the previous year’s Survivor Series. Since debuting, Undertaker had yet to be pinned in a televised match (although he did suffer several a handful of pinfall losses at untelevised arena shows). This earned him a shot at Hogan championship billing the match as Hogan’s “Gravest Challenge.” \nRic Flair arrived in the World Wrestling Federation on September 9, 1991 claiming to be the “Real World's Champion”. He debuted carrying the WCW title with him, which he never lost. He immediately began feuding with Roddy Piper. Both men would captain their teams at Survivor Series. Piper had Bret Hart, The British Bulldog, and Virgil while Flair had Ted DiBiase, The Mountie, and The Warlord. There were multiple storylines between the two teams as DiBiase and Virgil traded the million dollar championship since the previous pay per view event, The Mountie was after Bret Hart’s intercontinental championship, and the Warlord and The British Bulldog were currently feuding and would go to be scheduled for the following WrestleMania (although that match would not happen). \nSid Justice was originally scheduled to join the Big Bossman and The Legion of Doom while Jake Roberts was originally scheduled to join IRS and The Natural Disasters. Sid Justice was sidelined due to an elbow injury. Macho Man Randy Savage was campaigning to take Sid’s place due to an issue with Roberts showing up to Randy’s wedding with a cobra snake. Savage would have to be reinstated due to losing at to Ultimate Warrior in a “career match” at WrestleMania 7. At a television taping for \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" (which would air November 23), Roberts baited Savage into the ring where he would unleash his king cobra snake on Savage. Savage would not be reinstated for the match and Roberts also not be allowed to compete in the match due to his actions.\nThe Hogan-Undertaker and Savage-Roberts feuds would continue to build toward the WWF's next pay-per-view event, \"This Tuesday in Texas.\"\nAftermath.\nDue to Ric Flair's involvement in the events leading to The Undertaker's WWF World Heavyweight Championship victory over Hulk Hogan, a rematch was immediately signed for the This Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view event, contested December 3 at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. WWF president Jack Tunney was present at ringside to make sure there was no outside interference. During the match, Flair once again attempted to interfere on The Undertaker's behalf, but – in a chaotic series of events that saw Tunney get knocked out – Hogan was able to pin The Undertaker after throwing ash from manager Paul Bearer's urn in his eyes. The following weekend, Jack Tunney vacated the WWF Championship due to the controversial finishes of the last two matches between Hogan and Undertaker, and put the title up for grabs at the 1992 Royal Rumble. Meanwhile, Hogan and Flair began wrestling in a series of matches that had been highly anticipated since the late 1980s.\nDissension had been brewing for weeks between Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty of the Rockers, and at their Survivor Series match the two argued after Jannetty caused Michaels to be eliminated by accidentally slamming one of the Nasty Boys into him. In a segment of Brutus \"the Barber\" Beefcake's \"Barber Shop\" talk show segment taped December 2 and aired on January 12, the two aired their grievances before seemingly resolving to stick together and work through their difficulties. However, Michaels superkicked Jannetty and threw him through a plate-glass window that was part of Beefcake's set, cementing Michaels' heel turn. A feud was commissioned, but Jannetty was fired in January 1992, shortly before their first match was to take place; the two eventually met in a series of matches in 1993, when Jannetty returned. However, for Michaels, the \"Barber Shop\" segment and the superkick jumpstarted his career that would continue to grow during the 1990s and 2000s."

        "text": "The 1992 Survivor Series was the sixth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on November 25, 1992, at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio, which was the third time a Survivor Series was held there after the 1987 and 1988 events. It was the first Survivor Series to have only one match with the namesake elimination tag team match while the remaining matches were one-on-one and standard tag team matches.\nIn the final match on the card, Bret Hart retained his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels. The card also included a highly promoted match in which the team of Randy Savage and Mr. Perfect defeated the team of Ric Flair and Razor Ramon by disqualification; The Ultimate Warrior was advertised for the show but left the company and was replaced by Perfect. Also featured were two speciality matches: The Undertaker won a coffin match against Kamala, and The Big Boss Man defeated Nailz in a nightstick on a pole match.\nSome of the matches were changed after they were first announced, as several wrestlers left the WWF shortly before the event. The WWF Championship match and the main event tag team match won by Savage and Perfect, garnered praise.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 1992 event was the sixth event in the Survivor Series chronology and was the first in which the card was not dominated by Survivor Series matches; only one such match was scheduled to occur at the 1992 event. The event was scheduled to be held on November 25, 1992, at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield Township, Ohio.\nStorylines.\nIn the storyline behind the match between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, Nailz claimed that while he was serving time in prison, the Big Boss Man, who was a guard at the prison, mistreated Nailz. In early 1992, Nailz appeared in introductory vignettes to talk about his hatred of the Big Boss Man. Upon his debut in the WWF, Nailz attacked Bossman and stole his nightstick, which he used to attack his opponents over the following months.\nShortly after Tatanka's debut in the WWF, he became involved in a feud with Rick Martel. They faced each other at WrestleMania VIII, and Tatanka defeated Martel. The following month, Martel gained revenge by attacking Tatanka with an atomizer of cologne and stealing the eagle feathers that Tatanka carried to symbolize his Lumbee heritage.\nRic Flair and his \"executive consultant\" Mr. Perfect had been allies in the WWF for much of 1992. After Flair lost the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Macho Man Randy Savage at WrestleMania VIII, Flair and Perfect continued their feud with Savage. They interfered in Savage's match at SummerSlam and caused him to lose by countout. The rivalry continued, and Flair received assistance from Perfect and Razor Ramon to win the title back from Savage on September 1, which aired on the September 14 edition of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. The WWF planned for Savage to team with The Ultimate Warrior in a match against Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series, but Bobby Heenan announced at the end of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI\" that he had been informed either Savage or Warrior was going to have a new tag team partner. The Ultimate Warrior left the WWF before the match could take place. Two possible reasons have been given for his departure. The first states that he was fired due to allegations of steroid abuse, while the other states that he was upset with the WWF's future plans for his character. The WWF was forced to change the plan and decided to turn Perfect into a babyface (fan favorite) from a heel. Perfect and Flair began having conflicts while teaming together, and Perfect accepted Savage's offer on the November 16 episode of \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\" to team with him at Survivor Series.\nMoney Inc. (\"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) had been feuding with The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) since February 1992 when manager Jimmy Hart turned on Earthquake and Typhoon in favor of helping Money, Inc. With Hart's assistance, Money, Inc. defeated the Legion of Doom for the WWF Tag Team Championship on February 7, 1992. Five months later, Earthquake and Typhoon defeated Money Inc. to win the championship. The Natural Disasters were also feuding with The Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly) and defeated them in a title match at SummerSlam 1992. A match was then announced for Survivor Series in which The Natural Disasters would team with The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Luke and Bushwhacker Butch) to face Money, Inc. and the Beverly Brothers. However, when The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags), also managed by Hart, were scheduled to face The Natural Disasters for the title on October 13, Hart replaced The Nasty Boys at the last minute with Money, Inc., who went on to regain the championship with help from The Headshrinkers. This led to a break-up between Hart and the Nasty Boys, who received the Bushwhackers' spot in the Survivor Series match to get revenge against Jimmy Hart and Money, Inc.\nAt SummerSlam 1992 in August, The Undertaker defeated Kamala. Harvey Wippleman, Kamala's manager wanted revenge, so a rematch was scheduled for Survivor Series. The match was promoted as the WWF's first coffin match, in which the winner would place the loser in a coffin after the match.\nThe WWF also planned a match featuring The British Bulldog defending the WWF Intercontinental Championship against The Mountie at Survivor Series. The WWF released Smith due to steroid allegations, however, and he was made to drop the title belt to Shawn Michaels on the November 14 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI\". Ultimately, the WWF neglected to include an Intercontinental Championship match on the card as Michaels was already scheduled to challenge Bret Hart for the WWF Championship at Survivor Series. In this match, Hart's title was defended while Michaels' title was not.\nEvent.\nPrior to the pay-per-view broadcast, Crush defeated the Repo Man via submission. \nIn the first televised match, High Energy (Owen Hart and Koko B. Ware) faced The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). Samu used his strength advantage to control the opening of the match against Hart. Ware entered the match and gained the advantage over both opponents until he attempted to knock The Headshrinkers' heads against each other. According to WWF storylines, Samoans like The Headshrinkers have thick skulls and cannot be hurt in the head; as a result, The Headshrinkers no-sold the attack. Afa, The Headshrinkers' manager, attacked Ware while the referee was distracted. Samu and Fatu took turns attacking Ware, and Fatu performed a thrust kick on Ware. The Headshrinkers used rulebreaking tactics to control the match until Hart was able to enter the match. He performed dropkicks from the top rope against both Headshrinkers. As he tried to attack Samu from the top rope again, Samu caught him and powerslammed him before Fatu executed a diving splash to get the pinfall victory.\nThe next match, between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, was a nightstick on a pole match. A nightstick was suspended above the ring and could be used as a weapon once it was retrieved. Nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick, but Boss Man stopped him. Nailz choked Boss Man before making another unsuccessful attempt to climb the pole and obtain the nightstick. Boss Man punched Nailz and then tried to climb the pole. Nailz stopped him, performed a back body drop, and choked Boss Man again. Boss Man regained control but missed a splash, which gave Nailz another chance to retrieve the nightstick. Both men clotheslined each other, but Boss Man recovered first and got the nightstick. He hit Nailz with it, but Nailz took it and used it against Boss Man. Boss Man performed the Boss Man slam, his finishing move, before pinning Nailz to win the match.\nTatanka controlled the opening of the next match against \"The Model\" Rick Martel with several throws and dropkicks. Martel responded by wearing Tatanka down with a front facelock. Tatanka escaped, but Martel used another front facelock almost immediately. He performed a neckbreaker on Tatanka before going back to the same hold as before. Tatanka gained the advantage by performing a clothesline on Martel. Martel ran at Tatanka, but Tatanka moved out of the way and Martel hit his shoulder against the ring post. Tatanka focused on attacking Martel's injured shoulder but eventually was thrown out of the ring by Martel. Martel's advantage was short-lived, as Tatanka performed a series of backhand chops and a Tomahawk chop from the top rope before nailing The Model with a Samoan drop. Tatanka got the pinfall victory and retrieved his feathers from Martel after the match. While the match was in progress, a clown stood in the aisle and made balloon animals before popping them to upset the children in the audience.\nIn the next contest, promoted beforehand as the main event of the evening, Ric Flair and Razor Ramon wrestled against Mr. Perfect and Randy Savage. Ramon and Perfect began the match, but Flair entered after Perfect insulted him. Perfect threw Flair into the corner, and Flair's momentum carried him over the top rope to the ring apron. Savage attacked Flair and then took Perfect's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over Flair. From outside the ring, Ramon hit Savage with his knee and Flair and Ramon took turns attacking Savage's knee. While Ramon performed a half Boston crab on Savage, Perfect considered leaving the match and abandoning Savage. Savage recovered briefly by trying to pin Flair, but Ramon performed a chokeslam on Savage. Ric Flair attempted to attack Savage from the top rope, but Savage threw him to the ring floor instead. Perfect executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on Ramon. Outside of the ring, Flair attacked Savage with a chair. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Perfect tried to pin Ramon by performing a PerfectPlex. Because no referee was available to count the pinfall, a substitute referee came to the ring. The first referee recovered as Perfect attempted to pin Flair with a PerfectPlex. Flair escaped the pin attempt, and he and Ramon attacked Perfect until the referees were unable to keep the match under control. As a result, Ramon and Flair were disqualified, and the victory was awarded to Perfect and Savage.\nIn the next match, Virgil faced Yokozuna, who was billed at 505 pounds and making his pay-per-view debut. Virgil was unable to knock Yokozuna down with several dropkicks. Yokozuna performed a savate kick on Virgil before throwing him to the ring floor twice. He executed a legdrop on Virgil, but Virgil regained the advantage when Yokozuna accidentally ran into the ring pole while trying to attack Virgil. Yokozuna won the match after a splash in the corner and a Banzai Drop.\nThe following match was the only Survivor Series elimination match of the pay-per-view, in which The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly). The rules stated that when any man was eliminated, his tag team partner would also be eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural Disasters gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and the Nasty Boys entered the ring to assist the Disasters. Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash by sitting on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners. Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural Disasters. While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the Nasty Boys.\nThe coffin match, in which The Undertaker faced Kamala, came next. Kamala began the match by running in fear from The Undertaker. He gained the early advantage, however, by suddenly turning around and attacking The Undertaker. Kamala bodyslammed The Undertaker three times and performed three splashes. In an attempt to revive The Undertaker, Paul Bearer, his manager, held up an urn that was said to be the source of The Undertaker's power. Kim Chee, one of Kamala's handler's attacked Bearer. The Undertaker picked up the urn, which had rolled into the ring, and hit Kamala with it. The Undertaker pinned Kamala to win the match, placed him in a coffin, and nailed the lid shut.\nIn the last match of the card, Bret Hart defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels. Hart controlled the beginning of the match by repeatedly executing armdrags and armbars but Michaels gained the advantage when \"The Hitman\" missed a charge into the corner and collided shoulder-first with the ring post. Michaels then threw Hart into another ring post and wore him down by executing a front facelock. Hart was able to avoid Michaels' first attempt at his finisher, the modified back suplex, and rallied with his trademark moves including an elbow from the second rope, running bulldog and a superplex. Michaels recovered and performed a superkick on Hart and was able this time to apply his suplex, but Hart kicked out. After Hart missed a desperation crossbody and crotched himself on the ropes, Shawn attempted a dropkick from the middle rope but Hart grabbed Michaels' legs and applied the Sharpshooter, his finishing move. He retained his championship by forcing Michaels to submit.\nReception.\nSurvivor Series 1992 was attended by 17,500 fans, the same number as the previous year. It drew more fans than any of the following three Survivor Series event would draw. The pay-per-view buyrate was 1.4, which means that 1.4 percent of households to which the event was available purchased the pay-per-view. This was, to that point, the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history and down more than one-third from the previous year's 2.2 buyrate. The buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve Survivor Series events, however.\nDave Meltzer awarded the Hart-Michaels match 4.5 stars out of five, while giving the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect tag team match 3.25 stars. The remaining matches received 2.25 stars or lower, with Kamala vs. The Undertaker being an unrated \"dud\". Writing for \"The History of WWE\", Matt Pettycord stated that the event was \"pretty decent\" considering that The Mountie, Davey Boy Smith, and the Ultimate Warrior left the company shortly before the event. On a five-star scale, he rated only the aforementioned tag team match and Hart vs. Michaels higher than one star. He stated that the event is \"recommended, but not required\", although the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was a \"must-see\".\nAdam Gutschmidt, reviewing the event for \"Online Onslaught\", gave a rating of one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one-half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match was a good one until the ending got out of control. Brian Hoops of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the highlight and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable: he recommended fast-forwarding through the rest of the show.\nThe event was released in North America on VHS by Coliseum Video on February 11, 1993. The VHS version was released in the United Kingdom on March 8, 1993. A DVD version is also available in the United Kingdom; it was packaged together with Survivor Series 1991 as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line and released on November 7, 2005.\nAftermath.\nRic Flair and Mr. Perfect continued their feud, although Flair legitimately requested to be released from his WWF contract in order to return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). His request was granted on the condition that he help build up Perfect as a credible babyface. The two men attacked each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1993, and Perfect eliminated Flair from the match. The following night, Perfect defeated Flair in a loser leaves town match. Flair did not return to the WWF until McMahon purchased WCW in 2001.\nThe Undertaker's feud with Harvey Wippleman continued for several months after Survivor Series. At Royal Rumble 1993, Wippleman introduced a new wrestler named Giant Gonzalez. Despite not being scheduled in the match, Gonzalez attacked The Undertaker and eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match. The two men faced each other at WrestleMania IX, where Gonzalez was disqualified for attacking The Undertaker with a rag soaked in chloroform. Wippleman led Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes in another attack on The Undertaker, in which Hughes stole The Undertaker's urn. The feud was resolved at SummerSlam 1993, when The Undertaker defeated Gonzalez in a Rest in Peace match.\nYokozuna's push continued, and he won the battle royal main event at Royal Rumble 1993 to earn a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania IX. At WrestleMania, he defeated Hart to win the title belt. He immediately challenged Hulk Hogan to a match however, and WrestleMania ended with Yokozuna losing the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Hogan in 21 seconds.\nKevin Wacholz, who had portrayed Nailz, left the WWF shortly after Survivor Series. Upset about his pay from SummerSlam 1992, he confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon and reportedly attacked him physically. He later testified against McMahon during a trial in which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers. Wacholz' statements have been reported as having a harmful effect on the prosecution's case because his anger at McMahon overshadowed his testimony.\nShawn Michaels became involved in a feud with his former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty. The team had split up earlier in the year when Michaels attacked Jannetty. Michaels defeated Jannetty at Royal Rumble 1993, but the two traded the Intercontinental Championship back and forth in subsequent rematches.\nHart and Michaels would again main-event Survivor Series five years later for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship with Hart defending; however, Michaels would win the title in controversial fashion."

        "text": "The 1993 Survivor Series was the seventh annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Thanksgiving Eve on November 24, 1993, at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Six matches were contested at the event, including one dark match before the live broadcast.\nThe event consisted of four tag-team elimination matches and a bout for the Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The main event match saw the All-Americans, a team of face wrestlers from the United States, competing against the Foreign Fanatics, a team of heels that represented other countries. The All-Americans won the match when Lex Luger was the last man remaining. In an undercard match, four members of the Hart family competed against Shawn Michaels and a group of masked men. The original plan was for the Harts to face Jerry Lawler, with whom they were feuding, but Lawler was not able to appear at the event having been fired after being indicted for raping a 13-year-old girl. The Harts won the match, but a confrontation between Bret Hart and Owen Hart after the match led to Owen turning against the family the following year.\nThe majority of the feuds remained unresolved and carried on to future events. Bam Bam Bigelow was scheduled to face his main rival, Doink the Clown, but Bigelow's team ended up facing four other wrestlers wearing clown makeup instead. Matches from the Survivor Series also helped set up feuds for Royal Rumble 1994, the WWF's next pay-per-view. Razor Ramon's rivalry with Irwin R. Schyster intensified at Survivor Series and led to Ramon defending his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Schyster at the Royal Rumble. This event also marked the beginning of The Undertaker's feud with Yokozuna, and Yokozuna defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker at the 1994 Royal Rumble.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and one of the \"Big Five\", along with King of the Ring that was established in June 1993. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 1993 event was the seventh event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on Thanksgiving Eve on November 24, 1993, at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts.\nStorylines.\nSeveral feuds surrounded the opening match, which saw the team of Razor Ramon, Marty Jannetty, the 1–2–3 Kid and Mr. Perfect face the team of Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.), Diesel, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Diesel made his WWF debut on June 6, 1993, as a bodyguard for Shawn Michaels in a match between Michaels and Jannetty. Diesel's interference in the match helped Michaels to defeat Jannetty and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Diesel was also at ringside to help Michaels when Michaels faced Mr. Perfect for the title belt at SummerSlam 1993. Diesel attacked Perfect on multiple occasions during the match and ultimately caused Perfect to lose the match via countout. In September 1993, Michaels was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship by WWF President Jack Tunney. A battle royal was scheduled to determine the top two contenders for the championship. Ramon and Martel were the last two wrestlers in the ring, and they faced each other in a title match on the September 27 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\". Ramon won the match and was awarded the championship belt. Schyster had initiated a feud with Ramon in May 1993 after Ramon lost a match to The Kid (later the 1–2–3 Kid), who was competing as a jobber at the time. Schyster and his tag team partner Ted DiBiase made fun of Ramon for the loss and offered him a job as a servant. In response, Ramon teamed with the 1–2–3 Kid for a series of matches against Schyster and DiBiase, and he also distracted Schyster during a match and caused him to lose to jobber P.J. Walker. Adam Bomb was not involved in any feuds with his opponents at Survivor Series, but there was animosity between Bomb and his teammate Rick Martel. Bomb's manager, Harvey Wippleman, was at ringside to help Martel in a match against Ramon. Wippleman was standing in the way of the match, and Martel ran in to him. While Martel was distracted, Ramon pinned him to win the match. Martel then yelled at Wippleman and pushed him. Bomb came to the ring to defend his manager, and an argument ensued until Diesel and Schyster came to the ring to calm their teammates.\nJerry Lawler spent much of 1993 building a feud with the Hart family. Lawler had been using the nickname \"The King\" since defeating Jackie Fargo for the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship in 1974. After Bret Hart won the WWF's 1993 King of the Ring tournament, Lawler confronted him and claimed to be the only king in the WWF. Lawler then attacked Hart from behind, hitting Hart with the scepter and throne that had been set up for the coronation ceremony. The feud escalated when Lawler involved Helen and Stu Hart, Bret's parents, by insulting them while serving as commentator for WWF television programs. In what was billed as a \"Family Feud\" match, Bret Hart was joined by his brother Owen, who also worked for the WWF at the time, as well as his brothers Bruce and Keith, both of whom had also wrestled professionally. Lawler's partners were three masked wrestlers known only as the Blue Knight, the Red Knight, and the Black Knight. Lawler was unable to appear at the event, however, as he was indicted after being accused of raping and sodomizing a teenage girl. Shawn Michaels, who replaced Lawler in the match, also had a rivalry with Bret Hart dating back to the previous year. Hart, who held the Intercontinental Championship for much of 1992, defended the belt against Michaels many times, including in the WWF's first ladder match. They had also wrestled each other in the main event of Survivor Series 1992, when Hart defended his newly-won WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Michaels.\nThe Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship was defended at Survivor Series as part of a working agreement between WWF owner Vince McMahon and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) owner Jim Cornette. The Rock 'n' Roll Express, who held the belts going into the event, had been feuding with The Heavenly Bodies over the title for over a year. The rivalry had been violent at times, including a barbed wire cage match and a Texas deathmatch.\nDoink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow throughout October and November with such pranks as throwing water and confetti on him and dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall that was part of the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.\nIn the main event, the team of the All-Americans, which consisted of Lex Luger, Tatanka, and the Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) faced the Foreign Fanatics, which consisted of Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, and The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre). The main storyline behind the match began that summer when Yokozuna, a Japanese sumo wrestler, challenged any American athlete to bodyslam him on the deck of the USS \"Intrepid\" during an event on Independence Day. After several challengers were unable to lift Yokozuna, Luger arrived via helicopter and successfully performed what was termed \"the bodyslam heard around the world\". Luger was granted a match for Yokozuna's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam. Luger got a victory via countout but did not win the title. In the dressing room after the match, Borga, a Finnish wrestler, interrupted Luger's celebration by criticizing Luger and initiating a new feud. The Steiner Brothers spent the fall 1993 feuding with The Quebecers, a Canadian tag team. They had faced each other several times since The Quebecers had won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Steiners on September 13. Since arriving in the WWF, Tatanka had been on a two-year winning streak. Borga ended the streak on the October 30, 1993, episode of \"WWF Superstars\" by pinning Tatanka after hitting him with a chair. After the match, Borga and Yokozuna attacked Tatanka, causing kayfabe injuries that forced Tatanka to withdraw from the match at Survivor Series. The All-Americans recruited The Undertaker to replace Tatanka. On the November 15 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Luger defeated Pierre; as a result of a kayfabe injury in the match, the Foreign Fanatics had to replace Pierre with Crush, the sole American of the team. Crush was feuding with Randy Savage going into the event. They had been on-screen friends, but Crush was angry that Savage had not saved him from an attack by Yokozuna on the July 12, 1993, episode of \"Monday Night Raw\". To make his injuries seem real, Crush did not appear on WWF television programming for several months. He made his return on October 18, accompanied by Yokozuna's manager, Mr. Fuji, claiming that they sympathized with Crush's sense of betrayal by Savage. Savage tried to make amends with Crush, who then attacked Savage and announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States and was aligning himself with Yokozuna, Fuji, and Japan.\nEvent.\nPrior to the televised broadcast, Billy Gunn defeated The Brooklyn Brawler in a dark match. The first match on the pay-per-view event saw Razor Ramon, Randy Savage, the 1–2–3 Kid, and Marty Jannetty face Diesel, Irwin R. Schyster, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Prior to the match, Ramon announced that Savage was taking the place of Perfect, who was unable to appear. Martel and Ramon began the match in the ring, but Martel soon tagged out to bring Bomb into the match. Ramon performed a suplex on Bomb and attempted to pin his opponent. Martel tried to rescue his partner but ended up hitting Bomb instead and causing an argument. The 1–2–3 Kid entered the match but was overpowered by Bomb and Diesel. After the Kid tagged out, Savage performed a diving elbow drop on Diesel before getting the pinfall to eliminate Diesel from the match. Ramon was attacked by his opponents but eventually tagged Savage back into the match. Savage got distracted when Crush appeared in the aisle, however, which allowed Schyster to eliminate him from the match. Ramon then performed a Razor's Edge on Schyster and pinned him. Ramon attempted the same move on Martel, but Schyster snuck back into the ring and hit Ramon with a briefcase. Ramon fell out of the ring and was counted out of the match. The remaining four wrestlers fought back and forth, but the 1–2–3 Kid eventually pinned Martel after a sunset flip. Almost immediately, Jannetty performed a sunset flip on Bomb to win the match for his team.\nThe next bout was the \"Family Feud\" match that saw the Hart brothers (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) facing Shawn Michaels and His Knights. The knights wore masks to hide their identities, but it has been revealed that Jeff Gaylord was the Black Knight, Greg Valentine was the Blue Knight, and Barry Horowitz was the Red Knight. Ray Combs, then host of \"Family Feud\", told jokes to insult Shawn Michaels prior to the bout and later served as guest commentator for the match. Michaels began the match by wrestling Bruce Hart. Although Michaels was able to go on the offensive against the Hart brothers, the knights were unable to achieve much success against the Harts. At one point, all four wrestlers brawled in the ring, but Owen was able to eliminate the Black Knight after performing a missile dropkick. Michaels and the knights regained control of the match, but Bret turned things around by eliminating the Red Knight via submission to the Sharpshooter. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury after being thrown out of the ring and sat out of the match for a few minutes. Meanwhile, Michaels provoked Stu Hart into punching him. Inside the ring, Owen forced the Blue Knight to submit to the Sharpshooter, which left Michaels by himself. While Bret was standing on the ring apron, however, Owen ran in to him and got distracted. This allowed Michaels to pin Owen and eliminate him from the match. Bret dominated the rest of the match against Michaels until Michaels walked back to the locker room. As a result, Michaels was counted out, and the Harts won the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and yelled at Bret, blaming Bret for causing him to be eliminated from the match.\nAll four men began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring. The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) controlled most of the opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Prichard). Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Prichard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Prichard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.\nThe next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) against a team calling themselves the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately switched to the theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as \"Doinks on a Mission\". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making like he was going to toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.\nIn the final match of the evening, The All-Americans, consisting of Lex Luger, The Undertaker, and The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner), competed against the Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, Quebecer Jacques, and Crush). Scott Steiner and Jacques began the match, but Scott soon tagged in his brother Rick. Rick knocked Yokozuna out of the ring, but he was unable to perform much offense against Borga. Rick attempted a crossbody, during which Borga was supposed to catch him. Borga botched the move, but he pinned Rick anyway to eliminate him from the match. Crush faced Scott Steiner inside the ring, but Randy Savage then appeared in the aisle trying to get to the ring but was restrained by officials and The Smoking Gunns. Scott knocked Crush out of the ring, and Crush fought with Savage until being counted out of the match. Scott then turned his attention to Jacques before tagging Luger into the match. Luger eliminated Jacques with an elbow drop and a pinfall. Scott Steiner re-entered the match and executed a superplex on Borga. When he tried to pin Borga, however, Yokozuna entered the ring. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Steiner and pinned him to even the match at two wrestlers each. Luger fought with Borga and Yokozuna before tagging The Undertaker into the match. The Undertaker gained control of the match, but Yokozuna turned the momentum around by performing his signature move, the Banzai drop, on The Undertaker. When he attempted the move a second time, The Undertaker sat up. The two men then fought outside the ring until both were counted out and eliminated from the match. Luger and Borga then fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash and pinned Borga to win the match. After the match, Santa Claus came to the ring to celebrate with Luger.\nReception.\nThe attendance for the event was 15,509, which generated $180,000 in ticket sales. This was the lowest attendance for a Survivor Series event since 1989. The pay-per-view buyrate was 0.82, down from 1.4 the previous year, and was the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history to that point.\nThe event has been rated by several sources. Adam Gutschmidt, writing for \"Online Onslaught\", stated that \"many of the substitutions hurt the matches\" and that \"the main event was bland\". \"The Other Arena\" opined that the Four Doinks match was the worst on the card and that the confrontation between Lex Luger and Ludvig Borga was boring. Scott Criscuolo and Justin Rozzero reviewed the event for \"The History of WWE\". Both writers gave Survivor Series 1993 a \"C\" rating and viewed the Family Feud match as the worst on the card. Matt Peddycord, writing for \"411mania.com\", gave the event a 5.5 out of 10 rating. He pointed to the crowd's chant of \"We want Doink!\" as evidence that fans were upset by the Four Doinks match.\nSurvivor Series 1993 was released on VHS by Coliseum Video on December 15, 1993, in North America. It was released in the United Kingdom by Silver Vision; the VHS version was released on March 14, 1994, and the DVD was released as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line (packaged together with Survivor Series 1994) on September 4, 2006.\nAftermath.\nRazor Ramon continued with two of his feuds after Survivor Series. Irwin R. Schyster stole Ramon's gold chains, which set up a match for the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Despite interference from Shawn Michaels, Ramon pinned Schyster to retain the title. Michaels and Ramon then faced each other at WrestleMania X. Diesel got involved, but Ramon won the match. Ramon then defended his title against Diesel on April 13, 1994. Diesel won the match and became the new WWF Intercontinental Champion. Ramon regained the belt in a rematch at SummerSlam 1994, however. Meanwhile, the 1–2–3 Kid and Marty Jannetty continued with their push from the promotion and won the WWF Tag Team Championship on January 10, 1994.\nOwen Hart challenged Bret Hart to a match after Survivor Series, but Bret refused to fight his brother. The two reunited to face The Quebecers for the Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury during the match, which forced the referee to stop the match. Owen blamed Bret for the loss and attacked him after the match. They faced each other at WrestleMania X, where Owen defeated Bret. The rivalry continued, however, and the brothers feuded throughout 1994 and into 1995. Bret's feud with Lawler remained, but the two did not face each other again until In Your House 1 in May 1995. The feud was reignited at that time, and they feuded at several pay-per-view events in 1995.\nBam Bam Bigelow's feud with Doink the Clown remained unresolved for several months. They were in the ring at the same time during the main event of the 1994 Royal Rumble, which was a battle royal-style match. Bigelow attacked Doink and eliminated him from the match. The blow off match came at WrestleMania X, where Doink and his midget sidekick Dink faced Bigelow and his girlfriend Luna Vachon in a mixed tag team match. Bigelow and Vachon won the match to settle the feud.\nThe Steiner Brothers continued to challenge The Quebecers, but they were unable to regain the Tag Team Championship. As a result of their confrontation at Survivor Series, The Undertaker and Yokozuna faced each other at Royal Rumble 1994 in a casket match for Yokozuna's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, recruited several heel wrestlers to help Yokozuna win the match. The Undertaker supposedly died and disappeared from the WWF for several months, although, in reality, he was simply recovering from injuries. He resumed the feud with Yokozuna upon his return, however, and defeated Yokozuna in a casket match at Survivor Series 1994. Luger also continued his rivalry with Yokozuna. As a co-winner of the 1994 Royal Rumble match, Luger was granted a shot at Yokozuna's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Mr. Perfect, who had returned to the WWF, was the referee for the match and turned heel by disqualifying Luger during the match.\nLudvig Borga was scheduled to continue his feud with Tatanka in a match at Royal Rumble 1994. Borga sustained a legitimate ankle injury, however, and never returned to the WWF. WWF writers had also planned to have Borga feud with Luger, but they were forced to drop the storyline because of Borga's departure.\nCrush and Randy Savage also continued their feud. They fought each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1994 until Crush eliminated Savage. To end the rivalry, they faced each other in a Falls Count Anywhere match at WrestleMania X, which Savage won."

        "text": "The 1994 Survivor Series was the eighth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Thanksgiving Eve on November 23, 1994, at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. Since its inception, Survivor Series always took place on the traditional Thanksgiving Eve/Day date; the following Survivor Series and all subsequent shows have taken place on various Sundays before Thanksgiving (the 2005 and 2006 events were exceptions, as they were held in the Sunday after Thanksgiving weekend).\nTwo main event matches were held; in the first, Bob Backlund won the WWF Championship from Bret Hart in a submission match after Bret's brother Owen convinced their mother to throw in a towel to end the match. In the other main event, The Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special guest ring enforcer.\nThe event also featured three elimination matches and two singles matches. Razor Ramon led The Bad Guys against Diesel's team of The Teamsters. Ramon won the match for his team after all members of the other team were counted out. Doink the Clown teamed with three midgets to form Clowns Are Us in a match against The Royal Family, composed of Jerry Lawler and three midgets. The Royal Family won the match, but all seven other competitors attacked Lawler after the match. Lex Luger led Guts and Glory against the Million Dollar Corporation team, which was managed by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase's team won after Luger, the last wrestler from his team, was pinned.\nShawn Michaels and Diesel, the WWF Tag Team Champions going into the event, began feuding after Michaels accidentally kicked Diesel during the match. They vacated their title and began a feud that led to a match at WrestleMania XI. Three days after Survivor Series, Diesel won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Backlund. The rivalry between Backlund and Bret Hart continued, and they also faced each other at WrestleMania XI.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 1994 event was the eighth event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on Thanksgiving Eve on November 23, 1994, at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas.\nStorylines.\nSeveral storylines formed the background for the opening match, which saw the fan favorite team of The Bad Guys (Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith (a.k.a the British Bulldog) and The Headshrinkers) square off against the villainous team of The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped of the belt. WWF President Jack Tunney scheduled a battle royal, in which Ramon and Rick Martel were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on Monday Night Raw, and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title. Michaels claimed that he was the rightful holder of the belt and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion. Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon. In the months leading up to Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Ramon's friend, the 1-2-3 Kid, took Ramon's side in these feuds, and the two formed an occasional tag team. The Headshrinkers had also been feuding with Michaels and Diesel since dropping the WWF Tag Team Championship to them on August 28. The Headshrinkers had several rematches but were unable to regain the belts. Finally, Davey Boy Smith was involved in a feud with his real-life brother-in-law Owen Hart and Hart's other brother-in-law, Jim Neidhart. Owen Hart had turned on his brother Bret at the 1994 Royal Rumble, after which Smith got involved on Bret's side and Neidhart took Owen's side.\nAlthough Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown (Matt Osborne) had a storyline rivalry that dated back to when Doink turned on Lawler by dumping a bucket of water on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been mentioned since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.\nBret Hart's feud with Bob Backlund dated back to the July 30, 1994 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\". Backlund believed that he had won the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund slapped him in the face and locked him in a crossface chickenwing. After that Backlund began acting in a completely different manner than he had before, demanding respect from his fellow wrestlers insisting that they call him \"Mr. Backlund\" and using the crossface chickenwing, a hold he said was unbreakable, on them if they did not adhere to his wishes. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to The Iron Sheik's camel clutch. Playing off of this, a rematch between Hart and Backlund was signed for Survivor Series. The match was signed as a submission match, but with the stipulation that the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the other person throw in a towel. Since this required a wrestler to have a cornerman, each of the participants chose one. The challenger chose Owen Hart, while the champion went with Davey Boy Smith.\nThe central feud in the match between Guts &amp; Glory and The Million Dollar Team was between Lex Luger and Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. During 1994, DiBiase had \"purchased\" the contracts of several wrestlers to form a heel stable. Among the members to join were Bam Bam Bigelow and King Kong Bundy. Prior to SummerSlam 1994, DiBiase claimed to have added Luger to the group. Luger denied having joined, despite Tatanka claiming that he had evidence that Luger had \"sold out\" to DiBiase. Luger and Tatanka faced each other at SummerSlam, where it was revealed that the storyline was a swerve, as Tatanka turned on Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation. Bigelow and Adam Bomb had also been feuding since the September 10, 1994 episode of \"Superstars of Wrestling\". Bigelow attacked his opponent, a jobber, before the match. DiBiase then claimed that the company was not providing suitable competition, and he challenged any wrestler to face Bigelow. Bomb responded, and the two brawled briefly. Leading up to Survivor Series, Bomb and Bigelow faced each other at several house shows. The Heavenly Bodies were not members of DiBiase's stable, but they competed on behalf of the group. At the time, they were involved in a feud with The Smoking Gunns as a result of a match on the September 3 episode of \"Superstars of Wrestling\". The Heavenly Bodies attacked the Gunns prior to the match and stole the Gunns' cowboy hats. They put on the hats to mock the Gunns and then threw them on the ground and stomped on them. To get revenge, the Gunns stole The Heavenly Bodies' ring robes and tore the wings off them.\nThe feud between The Undertaker and Yokozuna began at Survivor Series 1993. During an elimination match, Yokozuna was unable to injure The Undertaker, despite slamming The Undertaker's head into the ring steps and performing the Banzai drop on him. A match was booked for Royal Rumble 1994, in which The Undertaker would challenge WWF World Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna for the title in a Casket match. During the match, which featured a no-disqualification clause, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, hired nine other wrestlers to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf. Yokozuna won the match after opening The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, contained the secret to The Undertaker's powers. After the match, The Undertaker appeared on the video screen and vowed to return to the World Wrestling Federation one day. He was not seen for several months, although, in reality, he was taking time off wrestling to allow injuries to heal. The Undertaker returned at SummerSlam 1994, defeating an Undertaker look-alike. A rematch against Yokozuna was scheduled for Survivor Series. This was also to be a Casket match, but Chuck Norris was brought in as a special outside referee to prevent interference.\nEvent.\nThe first match of the event saw The Bad Guys, which consisted of Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, the British Bulldog, and The Headshrinkers (Sione and Fatu) versus The Teamsters, composed of Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart. The opening minutes of the match featured brothers-in-law Hart and Smith trading moves as well as Jarrett and Ramon brawling. Fatu became the first wrestler eliminated after Diesel performed a Jackknife powerbomb on him. Diesel eliminated the 1-2-3 Kid forty-two seconds later after another Jackknife powerbomb. Sione followed thirty-one seconds later after being pinned by Diesel. Davey Boy Smith entered the ring, but Diesel soon knocked him between the ropes to the arena floor. Hart and Neidhart prevented Smith from getting back in the ring, and Smith was eliminated after the referee counted him out. Razor Ramon was left as the only member of his team to face the five members of The Teamsters. He fought with Diesel for several minutes, but Diesel then performed the Jackknife powerbomb on him and prepared to pin him for the victory. Michaels insisted on having Diesel hold Ramon while Michaels performed a superkick on their opponent. Ramon dodged the kick, and Michaels kicked Diesel in the face. Diesel became angry at Michaels, particularly because the same mistake had cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam. He and Michaels argued outside the ring while the rest of the team attempted to calm them down. The referee counted all five wrestlers out of the ring and declared Razor Ramon the winner of the match. Shawn Michaels was shown backstage after the match, and he stated that he was disbanding his tag team with Diesel and vacating the Tag Team Championship. He then got into a car and drove away from the arena.\nThe next match was between Jerry Lawler's team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and Doink's Clowns Are Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink). The rules were that only midgets could fight midgets and that neither Lawler nor Doink was allowed to attack the midgets. The match consisted of comedic action for much of the first ten minutes. Eventually, Doink attempted a crossbody, but Lawler reversed the move. until Lawler was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match. Lawler remained involved in the match and played a role in the elimination of two more members of Doink's team. When Wink attempted a monkey flip against Queasy, Lawler blocked the move and helped Queasy to pin Wink. Later in the match, Lawler threw Cheesy on top of Pink, which enabled Cheesy to eliminate another of Doink's teammates. After Wink and Pink were eliminated, however, they hid under the ring rather than returning backstage. The final member of Clowns Are Us was eliminated after Sleazy and Dink fought in the ring. Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him. Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that Sleazy was on top, however, and the referee made the three count and awarded the match to The Royal Family. As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory. Dink, Pink, and Wink emerged from under the ring. All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring. As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.\nThe next match was the submission match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation being that the only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.\nThe team of Guts and Glory, consisting of Lex Luger, Adam Bomb, Mabel, and The Smoking Gunns (Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn), faced The Million Dollar Team, made up of Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, and The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) in the next match. Guts and Glory took the early lead when Mabel pinned Prichard after performing a crossbody from the second rope. Mabel fought Bundy and Bigelow, but he was counted out after clotheslining Bigelow out of the ring. Bigelow then performed a moonsault on Bomb and got a pinfall. Luger and Del Ray fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash on Del Ray to get the pinfall. The Smoking Gunns were eliminated next, as Tatanka pinned Bart and Bundy pinned Billy. Luger fought back by pinning Tatanka with a small package. Seven seconds later, Bundy pinned Luger after performing a splash to get the victory. Bundy, Bigelow, and Tatanka continued to attack Luger after the match until Luger's team returned to the ring to save him.\nThe main event was next, featuring The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He tried to put The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. During the scuffle inside the casket, Mr. Fuji tried to interfere by grabbing the Undertaker from the back of his hair but he turned around, stalked Fuji and grabbed him with both hands on his throat. Cornette attempted to interfere as well, but he was struck down by the Undertaker. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring from the other side and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna, who fell through the ropes and into the casket. Undertaker then snatched the Japenese flag from Fuji's hand, and snapped in two, and slammed the lid to gain the victory.\nAftermath.\nShortly after Survivor Series, Diesel was named the top contender to Backlund's title. Backlund's first defense of his title was made at a Madison Square Garden live show three days after Survivor Series, where Diesel defeated him with the Jackknife Powerbomb in eight seconds. With the victory, Diesel joined Hart and Pedro Morales as the only wrestlers to that point to be Triple Crown Champion and became the quickest to do so having won all three components within the span of seven months. This record was broken by CM Punk in 2009.\nHart returned at the Royal Rumble in January 1995, where he faced Diesel to try to regain his title. Backlund interfered in the match, restarting the rivalry and leading to an I Quit match at WrestleMania XI. Hart won the match by using the crossface chickenwing to make Backlund concede defeat.\nTo fill the vacancy created when Diesel and Michaels broke up, an eight team tournament was announced with the finals scheduled for the Royal Rumble. The 1-2-3 Kid and Bob Holly won the tournament by defeating Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow (The Million Dollar Corporation) and won the titles but dropped the belts the following night to The Smoking Gunns.\nMichaels and Diesel's feud resumed at the Royal Rumble when Michaels attacked Diesel during his match with Hart. Michaels then became the top contender for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. Diesel won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would not be required during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, and Diesel came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn face, and he and Diesel resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.\nLex Luger's feud with the Million Dollar Corporation did not continue, as the Corporation targeted The Undertaker. The Undertaker spent most of the following year feuding with the Corporation, as he faced IRS at the 1995 Royal Rumble, King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania XI, and Kama at SummerSlam 1995. Luger was placed in a tag team with Davey Boy Smith known as The Allied Powers, but the team never won the tag team titles. The team was dissolved in the summer of 1995 after Smith turned heel and Luger left the company following SummerSlam to return to World Championship Wrestling.\nYokozuna did not regain his main event status after Survivor Series. After taking some time off, he made a surprise return at WrestleMania XI as Owen Hart's partner in a tag team title match against the Smoking Gunns. Yokozuna and Hart won the WWF Tag Team Championship, and Owen's feud with Bret was dropped. The brothers eventually reunited in 1997 to form The Hart Foundation, a stable that also included Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart."

        "text": "The 1995 Survivor Series was the ninth annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on November 19, 1995, at the USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland, and was the first Survivor Series to take place on a Sunday night. Each previous edition had taken place either on Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving Eve; the company would not do another non-weekend pay-per-view event until 2004, when Taboo Tuesday debuted.\nThe main event was a No Disqualification match between Diesel and Bret Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hart won the match and the title by pinfall, becoming a three-time champion and ending Diesel's 358-day reign – the longest of the 1990s.\nThe undercard featured Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog, and Sycho Sid versus Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Razor Ramon, and Dean Douglas in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, The Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu, and Henry Godwinn) versus The Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, Goldust versus Bam Bam Bigelow and Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe, and Lioness Asuka versus Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa, and Chaparita Asari in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match and The BodyDonnas (Skip, Rad Radford, Dr. Tom Prichard and 1-2-3 Kid) versus The Underdogs (Marty Jannetty, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz and Bob Holly) in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 1995 event was the ninth event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on November 19, 1995, at the USAir Arena in Landover, Maryland, and was the first Survivor Series to take place on a Sunday night. Each previous edition had taken place either on Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving Eve.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at Survivor Series featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, WWF. Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television program, \"Monday Night Raw\".\nThe main rivalry heading into the event was between Diesel and Bret Hart over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship which Diesel had held since he defeated Bob Backlund three days after Backlund's win over Hart at the previous year's Survivor Series. At In Your House 4, Hart served as the guest commentator during Diesel's title defense against British Bulldog, Hart's former ally who had recently turned on the fans and aligned himself with Bret's brother and nemesis Owen Hart. Bret interfered in the match by attacking Bulldog. As a result, Diesel was disqualified and thus retained the title. This angered Diesel and he argued with Hart, resulting in the two brawling with each other. As a result of the circumstances, on October 30 edition of \"Raw\", the WWF President Gorilla Monsoon signed a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Diesel and Hart to take place at Survivor Series. Diesel and Hart had faced off for the title two times before. At the 1994 King of the Ring, Bret defended against Diesel and lost by disqualification when his cornerman Jim Neidhart interfered to break up a potential pin. Earlier in 1995 at the Royal Rumble, Diesel made the first pay-per-view defense of his title against Hart, but the match ended in a no contest after Shawn Michaels, Owen Hart, and Backlund all interfered. With those two matches both ending in disqualifications, Monsoon added a No Disqualification stipulation to this rematch.\nAnother predominant rivalry heading into the event was over the Wildcard Survivor Series elimination match, pitting Shawn Michaels, British Bulldog, Ahmed Johnson and Sycho Sid against Razor Ramon, Owen Hart, Yokozuna and Dean Douglas. On the October 23 edition of \"Raw\", the WWF President Gorilla Monsoon made the match to make rivals team with each other and teammates compete against each other, forcing Bulldog to compete against his allies in Camp Cornette. Ramon and Douglas had been feuding with each other since the September 11 edition of \"Raw\" when Douglas interfered in Ramon's match with British Bulldog. At In Your House 3, Douglas defeated Ramon in a standard wrestling match. On the September 25 edition of \"Raw\", Douglas was made the #1 contender for Shawn Michaels' WWF Intercontinental Championship. A week before their match at In Your House 4, Michaels had been attacked in a club in Syracuse, New York. As a result, at In Your House 4, Michaels forfeited the title to Douglas. However, Douglas was forced to defend his newly won title against Ramon, who defeated Douglas for the title. Michaels and Sid's rivalry dated back to the February 20 edition of \"Raw\", when Michaels introduced Sid as his new bodyguard for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship title shot against Diesel at WrestleMania XI. However, despite Sid's interference, Michaels was defeated by Diesel. As a result, on April 3 edition of \"Raw\", Michaels informed Sid that he was no longer needed. Sid became angry and he attacked Michaels by powerbombing him three times, putting Michaels out of action for six weeks. This led to an Intercontinental Championship match between Michaels and Sid on September 11 edition of \"Raw\", which Michaels retained by defeating Sid. Ahmed Johnson, meanwhile, entered into the discussion shortly after his debut on the October 23, 1995 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\" when he became the second person after Lex Luger to bodyslam Yokozuna, thus starting a rivalry with him.\nThe rivalry between The Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu and Henry Godwinn) and The Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley) dated back to the annual King of the Ring tournament, when Mabel defeated Undertaker in the quarter-final round. On September 25 edition of \"Raw\", King Mabel interfered in Undertaker's match with British Bulldog, setting up a match between Undertaker and King Mabel at In Your House 4. However, on the October 9 edition of \"Raw\", King Mabel attacked Undertaker during a Six-man tag team match pitting Diesel, Shawn Michaels and Undertaker against Bulldog, Owen Hart and Yokozuna. Due to the attack, Undertaker was sidelined and was replaced by Yokozuna as King Mabel's opponent. On the November 6 edition of \"Raw\", it was announced that Undertaker's The Darkside team would compete against King Mabel's The Royals team in a Survivor Series elimination match at Survivor Series.\nGoldust made his WWF debut at In Your House 4, defeating Marty Jannetty. On the November 4 edition of \"Superstars\", Bam Bam Bigelow interrupted an interview of Goldust, setting up a match between Bigelow and Goldust at Survivor Series.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, the Smoking Gunns (Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn) defeated the Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) in a non-televised match.\nPreliminary matches.\nAs the event commenced, the first match that aired was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match between the Underdogs (Marty Jannetty, Hakushi, Barry Horowitz and Bob Holly) and the Bodydonnas (Skip, Rad Radford, Dr. Tom Prichard and 1-2-3 Kid). Kid substituted for Jean-Pierre Lafitte on the Bodydonnas team and Holly substituted for Avatar on the Underdogs team. Underdogs scored the first elimination when Holly performed a flying crossbody on Prichard. Skip then eliminated Holly by pinning him with a roll-up. Kid performed a spinning heel kick on Hakushi, allowing Radford to pin him for the elimination. BodyDonnas suffered the next elimination when Horowitz pinned Radford with a small package. Kid performed a leg drop on Horowitz for the elimination. Jannetty then eliminated Skip by performing a Superbomb. Jannetty had dominated the match as he climbed the top rope to perform a high-flying move on Kid, but Kid's manager Ted DiBiase distracted the referee, allowing Kid's Million Dollar Corporation teammate Sycho Sid to interfere in the match and drop Jannetty to the ring. Kid then pinned Jannetty to win the match and become the sole survivor from Bodydonnas team.\nThe second match was a four-on-four women's Survivor Series elimination match pitting the WWF Women's Champion Alundra Blayze, Kyoko Inoue, Sakie Hasegawa, and Chaparita Asari against Bertha Faye, Aja Kong, Tomoko Watanabe, and Lioness Asuka. Blayze made the first elimination when she pinned Asuka after performing a German suplex. Kong then dominated the match as she eliminated Hasegawa by performing a belly-to-back suplex, Asari by performing a diving splash and Inoue by performing a seated senton, which she called the \"Banzai Drop\". Blayze then dominated the opposing team as she eliminated Watanabe by performing a Piledriver and then eliminated opposing leader Faye by performing a bridging German suplex. Kong then performed an Uraken Punch on Blayze to win the match and become the survivor from Bertha Faye's team.\nThe next match was a singles match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Goldust. Goldust controlled most of the match against Bigelow while Bigelow performed poorly throughout the match and did not perform any high-impact moves that jeopardized his character during the match. Goldust eventually avoided a corner clothesline by Bigelow and performed a running bulldog to win the match.\nThe fourth match was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match pitting the Darkside (The Undertaker, Savio Vega, Fatu and Henry Godwinn) against the Royals (King Mabel, Jerry Lawler, Isaac Yankem and Hunter Hearst Helmsley). Undertaker controlled most of the match as he dominated Royals and made the first elimination by pinning Lawler after a \"Tombstone Piledriver\". Undertaker eliminated Yankem next in the same way by performing a \"Tombstone Piledriver\". Helmsley had to compete against Undertaker but he opted to escape the match. As he left the ring, he was chased to the ring by Godwinn, who came out to the ring with his slop bucket. As a result, Helmsley climbed the apron. Undertaker eliminated Helmsley by performing a chokeslam from apron to the other side of the ring. Mabel dominated Undertaker by performing a belly-to-belly suplex and a leg drop. However, Undertaker immediately sat up which scared Mabel and he escaped the ring and got counted out. As a result, the Darkside won the match with the entire team surviving.\nMain event matches.\nThe final match on the undercard was a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match pitting Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, British Bulldog and Sycho Sid against Yokozuna, Owen Hart, the WWF Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon and Dean Douglas. The tension arose between the two teams as heroes and villains were randomly distributed in both teams and the match was dubbed as a \"Wildcard\" match. The heroes and villains fought their own teammates as Ramon attacked his own teammate Douglas, allowing Michaels to eliminate him by pinning him with a roll-up. Sid was next on Michaels' team to dominate Ramon and grabbed him for Michaels to perform a superkick, which Michaels called \"Sweet Chin Music\". Michaels tried to hit the move but Ramon ducked and Sid was hit instead, allowing Ramon to pin Sid for the elimination. Sid retaliated by performing a powerbomb on Michaels. Johnson would then control the match as he eliminated Hart by performing a sitout double underhook powerbomb, which he called the \"Pearl River Plunge\". Ramon battled for his team and performed a crucifix powerbomb on Johnson, which he called the \"Razor's Edge\". However, Bulldog tagged Johnson which meant that Johnson could not be eliminated. Ramon was distracted by Sycho Sid, 1-2-3 Kid and Ted DiBiase, allowing Bulldog to perform a running powerslam for the elimination. Yokozuna battled the opposing team as he was the remaining member on his team. Johnson powerslammed Yokozuna and tried to pin him but Bulldog broke up the pin to save his ally. This caused Michaels and Johnson to attack Bulldog. Michaels then performed a Sweet Chin Music on Yokozuna and Johnson performed a diving splash on Yokozuna to win the match. Michaels, Johnson and Bulldog survived on their team.\nThe main event was a No Disqualification match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. As the match started, both wrestlers each untied a top turnbuckle. Hart focused on Diesel's knee and mainly attacked there. The action spilled to the outside where Diesel dominated Hart until the two returned to the ring, where Diesel tried to perform a jackknife powerbomb but Hart attacked Diesel's knee to get himself out of the move. Hart applied a figure four leglock on Diesel and then attempted to apply his submission maneuver \"Sharpshooter\" but Diesel attacked Hart's face and kicked him into the exposed corner. The match went back and forth with Hart repeatedly attacking Diesel's knee. The action spilled to the outside where both men attacked each other, with Diesel famously throwing Hart through the Spanish announcers table, until Diesel rolled Hart into the ring and tried to perform a jackknife powerbomb but Hart was almost knocked out and collapsed. Diesel tried to pick him up again for the jackknife powerbomb but Hart had been playing possum and hooked Diesel's leg and rolled him into a small package, getting the pin and winning the championship. An angry Diesel hit two jackknife powerbombs on Hart after the match.\nAftermath.\nSeveral departures took place after Survivor Series. Bam Bam Bigelow left WWF after losing to Goldust at Survivor Series and joined ECW later in 1995. The WWF Women's Champion Alundra Blayze was booked for a rivalry against Aja Kong. On the November 27 edition of \"Raw\", Kong and Tomoko Watanabe defeated Blayze and Kyoko Inoue in a tag team match. It would turn out to be Blayze's last appearance in WWF as she made a shocking appearance on the December 18 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" and dropped the Women's Championship into a trashcan.\nOn the November 6 edition of \"Raw\", it had been announced by Camp Cornette's (kayfabe) lawyer Clarence Mason that the winner of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Diesel and Bret Hart at Survivor Series would defend the title against British Bulldog. Since Hart won the title at Survivor Series, a title match was set up between Hart and Bulldog at In Your House 5. At In Your House 5, Hart defeated Bulldog to retain the WWF World Heavyweight title.\nFollowing the Survivor Series matchup, Diesel became a \"tweener\" saying that he would accept the support of fans who liked him, but didn't care about the fans that didn't. This attitude remained until shortly before In Your House 6 when Diesel lost a steel cage match against Bret Hart due to interference by The Undertaker. Not long after, Diesel broke ties with Shawn Michaels and remained a \"heel\" for the remainder of his WWF run.\nSince 1-2-3 Kid had turned on Razor Ramon during his match against Sycho Sid by helping Sid win the match and join Million Dollar Corporation on the November 13 edition of \"Raw\", Ramon and Kid began a rivalry. Marty Jannetty also got involved in the rivalry as he was screwed out of the victory against 1-2-3 Kid at Survivor Series during Underdogs versus BodyDonnas match. On the November 20 edition of \"Raw\", Jannetty tried to attack Kid and his manager Ted DiBiase but received a Powerbomb by Sid. On the November 27 edition of \"Raw\", it was announced that Ramon and Jannetty would compete against Kid and Sid in a tag team match at In Your House 5. At In Your House 5, Ramon and Jannetty defeated Kid and Sid when Ramon pinned Sid."

It was the third and final Survivor Series event to be presented by Milton Bradley's Karate Fighters. The event took place on Sunday, November 9, 1997, at the Molson Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's tagline \"Gang Rulz\" refers to the various wrestling stables that feuded with each other heading into this event. Seven matches were contested on the event's card.\nThe main event was a standard wrestling match for the WWF Championship, in which Bret Hart defended the title against Shawn Michaels. It was the last of three WWF Championship matches between the two, who had previously headlined the 1992 Survivor Series and WrestleMania XII together. Michaels won the title in controversial fashion when Vince McMahon ordered match referee Earl Hebner to end the match as Michaels held Hart in Hart's own finishing maneuver, the Sharpshooter, even though Hart had not submitted. This incident became known as the Montreal Screwjob and marked Hart's last appearance on WWE programming until 2006. This was also the last time that Hart held a title in WWE until May 2010, and the last time he headlined a WWE pay-per-view until SummerSlam 2010. According to WWE, the Montreal Screwjob, which took place at the end of the last match on the card, is considered the beginning of the Attitude Era. A video package aired immediately before the Hart vs. Michaels match, featuring the first use of the \"WWF Attitude\" scratch logo.\nThe undercard featured Stone Cold Steve Austin versus Owen Hart in a standard wrestling match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, Kane versus Mankind, and four 4-on-4 elimination tag team matches were included.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987.

Wrestlers portrayed a hero or a villain as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe Storyline feud between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels began after Michaels became the number one contender to the WWF Championship by defeating The Undertaker in the first Hell in a Cell match at . On the following nights episode of \"Raw is War\", while Michaels, alongside his friend Hunter Hearst Helmsley were blurting out insults to Vince McMahon by the announce table, Hart alongside members of The Hart Foundation appeared with Hart calling Michaels nothing more than a degenerate before challenging Triple H to a match later that night. Hart later lost to Helmsley by count out after Michaels hit him with Sweet Chin Music while he was blocking an attack by Helmsley's bodyguard Chyna.\nImmediately after the Steve Austin vs. Owen Hart match and before the Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels match, a video package was aired featuring promos from Ahmed Johnson, The Undertaker, Bret Hart, Faarooq, Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels discussing their athletic backgrounds and injuries suffered, ending with Bret Hart saying \"Try lacing my boots,\" and finally with the first use of the \"WWF Attitude\" scratch logo displayed on the screen. In later re-airings of the video package, Hart's tagline was replaced by Austin (also saying \"Try lacing my boots\").\nIn the main event, Shawn Michaels de. Bret Hart in 19:58 and became the new WWF Champion, after Michaels locked Hart into the sharpshooter. Even though Hart had not submitted, Michaels was declared the winner, as Earl Hebner, on direct orders from McMahon, called for the bell.\nReception.\nIn 2015, Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 6.0 [Average], stating, \"Shortly after the WWE Network launched, I watched this show and disliked it. Looking at it now, it’s pretty good. The Survivor Series matches, except for the DOA one, are all relatively fun. It also gets the score bumped up a bit more due to the historical value here. The main event, while not classic, kind of has to be seen by any and every wrestling fan.\"\nAftermath.\nThe controversial ending surrounding Shawn Michaels defeating Bret Hart by submission and winning the WWF Championship due to Vince McMahon ordering the referee Earl Hebner to ring the bell without Hart submitting became known as the Montreal Screwjob. Hart left the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) immediately after the incident and moved to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he became a two-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, a four-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion and one half of the WCW World Tag Team Champions before retiring in 2000 after a severe concussion. Hart next appeared in the WWF (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) in 2010 when he and Michaels called a truce and buried the hatchet on the Montreal Screwjob, having been inducted to the WWE Hall of Fame four years prior.\nAfter Survivor Series, Shawn Michaels began his third reign as WWF Champion. He entered a feud with Ken Shamrock over the WWF Championship which culminated at where Michaels retained the title after Shamrock won by disqualification after being attacked by D-Generation X (DX) members Triple H and Chyna. Michaels lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV before a four-year hiatus after a back injury during a casket match against The Undertaker at the 1998 Royal Rumble. He returned at SummerSlam 2002.\nAfter winning the Intercontinental Championship, Stone Cold Steve Austin entered into a feud with The Rock over the title after The Rock stole Austin's title belt after a beat down from The Nation of Domination on the November 17 episode of \"Raw is War\". Austin retained the Intercontinental Championship and regained the belt by defeating The Rock at D-Generation X: In Your House. Austin forfeited the title to The Rock the next night on \"Raw is War\" with the sole intention of going after the WWF Championship before hitting The Rock with a Stone Cold Stunner.\nVince McMahon's actions of screwing Bret Hart from the WWF Championship marked the beginning of the Mr. McMahon character, the tyrannical CEO of WWF. In 1998, McMahon began a legendary rivalry with Stone Cold Steve Austin.\nThe events of the Montreal Screwjob repeated at the following year's Survivor Series, albeit worked, when The Rock locked Mankind in the Sharpshooter before Mr. McMahon ordered the referee to call for the bell, \"screwing\" Mankind and awarding the then-vacant WWF Championship to The Rock."

It took place on November 15, 1998, at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, Missouri.\nFourteen professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, a noticeably higher number than most pay-per-view events because the main focus of the card was a tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. It was the first tournament held with the WWF Championship on the line in ten years, the last being at WrestleMania IV. Both tournaments were 14-man tournaments instead of the regular 8 or 16-man tournaments. Aside from the tournament, two other championship matches occurred: the first defense of the WWF Women's Championship since it had been reactivated and a triple threat tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nThis event was also the first Survivor Series not to include any Survivor Series elimination matches, although the notion of survival is apparent in the knockout tournament. \nThe event was the first ever Survivor Series which did not feature Bret Hart.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 1998 event, however, did not feature such match, and was the first of only three times a Survivor Series match did not occur at the titular event—the second in 2002, and the third in 2022. In place of the traditional Survivor Series match, for this event, was a 14-man single elimination tournament for the vacant WWF Championship called \"Deadly Game\". The 1998 event was the 12th event in the Survivor Series chronology and was subtitled \"Deadly Game\" for the aforementioned tournament. The event was scheduled to be held on November 15, 1998, at the Kiel Center in St. Louis, Missouri.\nStorylines.\nSurvivor Series consisted of professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines that played out on \"Raw is War\" — WWF's primary television program. Wrestlers portrayed a hero or a villain as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. \nMain storyline.\nThe major storyline involved the WWF Championship, which had been vacant since September after the events of where the Undertaker and Kane both pinned then champion Steve Austin at the same time in a match for the WWF championship.\nIn March, Stone Cold Steve Austin had won the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XIV, and in the months that followed company owner Vince McMahon had been scheming to get the title off of him as he did not feel Austin was suitable for the company's image. \nAustin would eventually lose the title in a First Blood match against Kane at King of the Ring in June after Kane's (Kayfabe) half-brother, The Undertaker, struck Austin with a chair to save Kane from hurting himself despite the two being in a feud dating from Kane's debut in 1997. Kane's reign did not last long, however, as Austin coerced him into a rematch for the title the next night on the Raw episode following the pay-per-view and defeated him to regain the WWF Championship. \nAustin and Undertaker then began a brief but strained alliance shortly thereafter that resulted in a brief 15 day WWF Tag Team Championship reign before a title match was signed between the two for SummerSlam in August. However, shortly before the event it was revealed that Undertaker and Kane had been in cahoots all along. After Austin retained the title at SummerSlam, it was revealed that the brothers had also made a deal with McMahon to try and ensure Austin lost the championship. This led to the match at Breakdown, which was signed as a triple threat match but became a de facto handicap match; McMahon added a stipulation that Undertaker and Kane could not score a fall against each other and could only do so against Austin. Austin would go on to lose the match and the championship, with Undertaker and Kane both pinning him simultaneously. \nAfter Breakdown, McMahon held a ceremony to award the WWF Championship but before he could name Undertaker or Kane the champion, Austin crashed the ceremony to attack McMahon. McMahon, furious at the brothers for failing to protect him from Austin, decided to leave the title vacant and booked a special match at . Not only would Undertaker and Kane wrestle for the vacant title against their will, McMahon ordered Austin to serve as the referee so he would have the “indignity” of being forced to count a fall and crown a new champion. Austin told McMahon he would not raise anyone's hand but his in victory, leading McMahon to threaten him with termination if he did not perform his duties properly. Austin called McMahon's bluff, attacking both Undertaker and Kane and counting them out, and then declared himself the winner and champion. McMahon then made good on his threat to fire Austin.\nSince the Undertaker-Kane match had not resolved anything and the title was still vacant, it was decided that a tournament would be set up to decide the champion at Survivor Series. Fourteen wrestlers were signed to take part in what was referred to as the “Deadly Game”, with the last man standing winning the WWF Championship at the end of the night.\nOther storylines.\nDespite being fired, Austin was at \"Raw Is War\" the night after Judgment Day and held McMahon hostage at gunpoint, though when Austin went to fire his gun it turned out to be a joke gun, with a sign saying \"BANG! 3:16\" on it; Austin left the ring when McMahon soiled himself, having given him a piece of paper. Austin revealed the following week that the paper was a five-year contract that guaranteed him a championship match and most shockingly of all, the contract had been signed by Mr. McMahon's son Shane, who had his owner rights suspended by his father and was demoted to a referee.\nAs well as Austin, McMahon seemed to have a new target of hatred. On the November 2 edition of \"Raw Is War\", McMahon declared to the self-styled People's Champion that because he had a problem with the people, he had a problem with The Rock. He then ordered Rock into an Intercontinental match with Ken Shamrock, with Rock's tournament spot on the line. Shamrock hit him with a chair and thus he won, but only by disqualification and thus lost his tournament spot. Afterwards McMahon had The Rock arrested, much like he had done months before with Austin. The following week McMahon threatened him with expulsion from the company if he could not win a match against former Nation of Domination stable mate Mark Henry. Despite the odds being stacked in his favor with McMahon's entourage at ring side distracting the referee, Shane McMahon ran down after Rock had performed the Rock Bottom, a lifting side slam, on Henry and counted the pinfall to secure Rock's employment and, presumably, earning back his spot in the tournament although this was never specifically mentioned other than McMahon mentioning it on Heat.\nWhile many wrestlers became the target of Vince McMahon's ire, one wrestler returned to being his favorite. With his son ostensibly turning on him, Mankind tried to cheer McMahon up and was treated as a surrogate child. McMahon awarded him a new belt, the WWF Hardcore Championship, as well as giving him a makeover, including a pedicure, haircut and tailored suit, gearing him up to win the tournament. As well as being a Hardcore Champion, Mankind had formed an ad hoc tag team with Al Snow; the humorous duo mocked each other's mascots which they talked to, Mr. Socko and Head. In a tag team match Mr. Socko went missing and it later transpired that Mr. McMahon had wrapped it round Al Snow's Head in order to provoke his wrath. Snow himself had also had several run-ins with Jeff Jarrett, after Jarrett had opened his guitar case only to find Head inside, instead of his trademark weapon.\nFamily problems were abound elsewhere with the return of Paul Bearer at Judgment Day. Bearer had been at Kane's side ever since his debut the previous October at , but when Kane and Undertaker allied to take down Austin, Kane turned his back on Bearer and allowed Undertaker to beat him. When Bearer returned he seemed to be on Kane's side, but in fact he gave a chair to Undertaker to strike Kane with, revealing on Raw that he had returned to being Undertaker's mentor.\nFor weeks, vignettes had announced the arrival of Steven Regal under the gimmick of \"a man's man\". Regal made his debut by attacking the European Champion X-Pac from behind on \"Raw is War\". Also, a masked man in a SWAT style uniform appeared alongside Mr. McMahon to defend him against Austin's attacks. The enforcer turned out to be the returning Big Boss Man, who after a stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) had taken on the role of personal bodyguard for McMahon.\nThe two other feuds going into the event were both championship feuds. Marc Mero grew jealous of his valet Sable and the attention she gained, eventually having her fired by defeating her in a match. When she returned as a wrestler in her own right, Mero employed a new valet Jacqueline and the two naturally squared off. Firstly they had a bikini contest, which Sable won by popularity, but was disqualified as her bikini consisted of handprints. The two then had an arm wrestling contest, which ended with Jacqueline cracking the bikini contest trophy over the head of Sable. When Sable revealed the Women's Championship had been reactivated, the two met for a match on Raw, in which Jacqueline won due to Mero holding Sable's legs down. After Sable was further humiliated when Jacqueline cut a piece of her hair and wrapped it into her own hair, Sable demanded a championship match.\nThe Headbangers had met the New Age Outlaws the previous month and after dominating most of the match, won via disqualification when Road Dogg broke a boombox over Mosh's head. Despite titles not changing hands by disqualification, the Headbangers began to declare themselves champions, coming to the ring with toy replica belts and parodying New Age Outlaws pre-match speeches. With the dissolution of The Nation, D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry stayed together as a tag team and with Brown's feud with X-Pac over the European title, by messing with one D-Generate, he picked an unwitting fight with the Outlaws too.\nEvent.\nFirst round.\nThe opening match was part of the tournament and saw Mr. McMahon introduce Mankind and his mystery opponent. After a grandiose introduction, promising a WWF veteran with a record setting win–loss record, jobber Duane Gill came out. The match barely lasted one minute as Mankind knocked Gill to the mat and rolled him up for a pin.\nAl Snow's match against Jeff Jarrett began with Snow following Jarret's valet, Debra McMichael. Snow soon entered the ring and took the first advantage, using the ropes to aid him with a neckbreaker but mistiming a flying leg drop. After a succession of reversed pinfalls attempts by both parties and a DDT by Snow, both men were lying on the mat. Debra walked onto the apron with Snow's mannequin head to distract the referee and allow Jarrett to pick it up. Snow himself grabbed Jarrett's guitar and swung for Jarrett, but missed and received Head. Jarrett went to attack him again in the corner but a kick from Snow allowed him to grab the Head and smack into it Jarrett's face, allowing a victory via pinfall when the referee finally looked back. Snow faced Mankind in the quarter-finals.\nBig Boss Man met Steve Austin on the walkway for their fight, with Austin throwing Boss Man into the steel steps before the match was officially under way. Inside the ring Boss Man used his punches to subdue Austin before choking him in the middle of the ring. Crowd support inspired Austin to fight back with a clothesline, shoulder barging his opponent into the turnbuckle before stomping a mudhole. After being Irish whipped against the ropes, Boss Man escaped the ring and when Austin caught up with him, he was met with a night stick from the Boss Man. The referee awarded the match via disqualification to Austin but that did not stop the onslaught from Boss Man's nightstick, much to the delight of Mr. McMahon.\nThe fourth tournament match, between European Champion X-Pac and Steven Regal, saw X-Pac's fast-paced style take advantage over Regal until a mistimed bronco buster in the corner left X-Pac in pain. Regal pulled him out to fit a seated abdominal stretch on him. Regal's mat-based technical style kept X-Pac slowed down and without much of his arsenal. Regal ventured to the top rope with his opponent, utilizing a double-underhook suplex from the top turnbuckle to put pressure on X-Pac's fragile neck. X-Pac regained the offense but when he went for a top rope maneuver, Regal shook the ropes, causing him to fall to the outside. Regal pursued him and both men were counted out. On McMahon's orders, Commissioner Slaughter attempted to restart the match but as an injured and confused X-Pac was already halfway up the ramp and Regal pursued him backstage, the match was not restarted, giving Steve Austin a bye through to the semi-finals.\nThe next match, between Ken Shamrock and Goldust, began as a high-speed encounter with both wrestlers making many running attacks, until Shamrock had Goldust on the floor at which point he began to use a chin lock to slow him down. Goldust regained some momentum after standing up and, although Shamrock was able to reverse it initially Goldust soon had some advantage in the match. Things changed though when Goldust set his opponent up for the illegal move, Shattered Dreams. As Goldust made the run up, the referee jumped in the way to prevent the low blow which gave Shamrock the time to jump up to the top rope, jumping onto Goldust for a hurricarana, following it up immediately with an ankle lock that made Goldust submit.\nIn the last first round match, the Rock was to square off against a returning Triple H. However, Triple H did not appear (presumably due to his knee injury); instead Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco came out, and presented a \"last minute replacement\" in the form of Big Boss Man, who ran to the ring only to be rolled into a pin for the shortest match in WWF history, three seconds.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first of the quarter-final matches, which saw the time limit increased to fifteen minutes, was between two wrestlers who received byes through the first round, the warring brothers Undertaker and Kane. Both threw each other around the ring before the match was taken briefly outside, Undertaker thrown into the crowd barrier and Kane stomped into the steel steps. Although Kane would retake the advantage in the ring, a jumping elbow drop met with the mat when Undertaker set up. Undertaker used the opportunity to take out Kane's knee, using a number of attacks and holds on it. Undertaker pushed the rules to the limit by choking Kane in the corner and as the referee reprimanded him, Kane was able to recuperate to fight back. After a series of punches and a flying lariat the two were even again, this was symbolised when Undertaker grabbed Kane's throat for a chokeslam from a running attack. Kane did the same and eventually was able to deliver the chokeslam. Before he could pin his brother though, Paul Bearer jumped on the apron to distract Kane and in the interim period Undertaker stood up to deliver a tombstone piledriver and pin his brother, with Bearer holding Kane's leg down.\nMankind met Al Snow next, with Snow throwing Mankind around the ring and barging him to the floor before dropkicking him to the outside. Mankind tried to balance things by grabbing a steel chair but Snow took it off him and hit him twice (without disqualification), before mistiming an attack to the ring post allowing for Mankind to take charge. Having been beaten in the ring, Snow crawled to Head to use as a weapon but swung and missed, allowing Mankind to deliver a back drop. As he did, Head came away in his hand and he realized Mr. Socko was tied round Head's head. The rage saw him beat the mannequin, stamping on it before turning his attention back to Al Snow to land a double-armed DDT and then the mandible claw to win the match and setting up a match for Steve Austin in the next round.\nThe final second round match pitted the long-feuding Shamrock and The Rock against each other. Rock began his attack instantly, punching and clotheslining Shamrock before the latter replied with a suplex. Rock was not down for long, coming out of a kneeling position with another clothesline before chasing Shamrock out of the ring and spitting water into his face but receiving steel steps in the shoulder for it. Big Boss Man came to the ring as Shamrock moved from a chin lock into his ankle lock. Rock held on and slowly crawled for the ring break. After breaking away both men collided with a double clothesline allowing both men to recover and, after a failed pin attempt, stand up and fight again. Rock dynamically swung around Shamrock's body to secure a DDT attempt and as Boss Man distracted the referee, punched Shamrock in the crotch. Despite this, and a People's Elbow, Shamrock still kicked out and managed to reverse a Rock Bottom attempt into a belly-to-belly suplex. Boss Man tried to interfere again, slyly throwing a night stick to Shamrock as the referee was distracted. Rock intercepted the night stick though, allowing him to strike down Shamrock and make a pinfall.\nWomen's Championship.\nHalfway through the evening, women's Champion Jacqueline defended her title against Sable. The match seemed to be over almost instantly as, after a flurry of strikes Sable used the TKO on Jacqueline. Marc Mero, though, pulled Sable away from the pinfall for which he received a kick to the groin, followed by a Sable Bomb on the outside of the ring allowing Jacqueline to recover and attack her from behind, rolling her back into the ring and taunting Sable with the hair Jacqueline had cut a few weeks before. Sable was then taken to the corner and kicked before being set up for a powerbomb. Sable tossed the champion over her back but Jacqueline crawled her over to the corner to set up a tornado DDT from the turnbuckle. Sable reversed again, throwing Jacqueline to the ground, picking her up to deliver a Sable Bomb and winning the Women's Championship.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first semi-final between Corporate-sponsored Mankind and fan-favorite Steve Austin started more with a brawl than wrestling; Mankind threw off his tuxedo jacket as the two exchanged rough punches until Austin landed in the corner at which point Mankind began to bite him before landing a knee drop into his face and using his shoe as a weapon. After receiving a Lou Thesz press and a stunner attempt, Mankind ran away but McMahon's cronies, who were at ringside caught up with him and stopped him. Austin caught him from behind with a clothesline and the two fought in and out of the ring with referee Mike Chioda reluctant to count out or disqualify either wrestler. As the two met back in the ring, they grappled so much that Mankind's shirt came out of his trousers, resembling more and more his old appearance by the time a double clothesline floored both wrestlers. Mankind was thrown a chair from the outside but as he ran it into Stone Cold, Austin put his foot up, kicking Mankind through the chair. Still, Mankind was unabated delivering a double-armed DDT onto the chair and when that would not keep Austin down, he tried a piledriver on the chair but Austin ran him forward then tossed him over his back so that he landed on the chair. He picked him up and executed a Stone Cold Stunner on the chair too and as he made what seemed to be the inevitable victory, McMahon jumped out of his wheelchair and pulled the referee out of the ring, punching him to the ground and kicking him. With Austin looking on in shock, Mankind applied the mandible claw but as his trousers fell down he had trouble maintaining balance. Austin threw him into the ropes and caught another stunner, covering him despite there being no referee; suddenly Shane McMahon ran down the ramp and slid into the ring counting, but then stopping suddenly at two and as Austin looked up, Shane sat up on his knees and gave Austin the finger. Gerald Brisco and Slaughter climbed in the ring and hit Austin with a chair, then Shane counted the pinfall advancing Mankind into the final. McMahon's entourage sped off quickly, jumping into a limousine and being followed by Austin.\nThe second semi-final between The Rock and The Undertaker was fought initially around ringside, mostly a series of punches and headbutts until Rock was thrown back into the ring. The Rock was pummeled by a series of strikes and throat punches from Undertaker that eventually left him tied up in the ropes. From this position he was able to toss Undertaker out of the ring and followed him, fighting in the crowd eventually. Back in the ring there was still no discernible advantage, both exchanging punches and The Rock delivering a Samoan Drop. As the two lay motionless on the mat, Big Boss Man came back to ringside, apparently having not left with the rest of McMahon's entourage. He stopped Rock from finishing the People's Elbow by grabbing at his foot, allowing Undertaker to take Rock down, though Undertaker struck Boss Man from the apron. As Undertaker set up The Rock for a chokeslam, Kane climbed in the ring and Undertaker threw The Rock into Kane's hands, with Kane delivering a chokeslam to The Rock. This gave The Rock a win via disqualification and he advanced onto the final as Undertaker and Kane fought through the crowd.\nTag Team Championship.\nNext, the WWF Tag Team Championship was contested in a triple threat match between the champions, the New Age Outlaws (\"Bad Ass\" Billy Gunn and Road Dogg), and two challenging teams – D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry and The Headbangers. Gunn and Brown fought with Mosh trying to steal a pinfall. Gunn let Brown and Mosh fight while he tagged in Road Dogg, although this amounted to little as the New Age Outlaws threw both Headbangers out the ring and took a ten-punch to Brown and Henry. Both Headbangers returned to double team Road Dogg and the match was resumed proper with Mosh and Brown both attempting pins on Road Dogg and then teaming up on him, changing partners to continue the onslaught until Brown threw out Road Dogg and turned on Mosh, managing a frankensteiner on him but soon falling fowl to a Russian leg sweep. When Road Dogg returned he took the brunt of assault again and as he was down Brown's running powerbomb on Mosh was reversed into a sunset flip like pin. Both changed partners again, with the Headbangers double teaming Road Dogg but not helping Brown to double team them and instead delivering a low blow but without securing a pinfall. As their alliance failed, Road Dogg crawled to tag in the yet unused Billy Gunn, whose hot tag saw him take down everybody until Brown caught him from a running momentum to land a Lo Down which strangely referee Tim White delayed his pin count. After Billy Gunn kicked out, he jumped on a running Mosh to land the Fameasser and then a piledriver to retain the championship with a pin victory.\nFinal.\nThe tournament final began slowly, with The Rock and Mankind trying to gauge each other. Both wrestlers secured takedowns or the other before Mankind slowed down the match with a sleeper hold on Rock. At this point, Mr. McMahon and Shane, who had faked their escape from the arena to rid themselves of Austin, walked down to ringside. Rock fought his way back to his feet in the sleeper hold and backdropped Mankind, before tossing him outside the ring. He then reversed a suplex with one of his own before dropping Mankind's crotch onto the crowd barrier. Both wrestlers returned to the ring briefly, only for Mankind to Cactus Clothesline them back out to the announce tables where Mankind grabbed a steel chair and floored The Rock, with referee Earl Hebner not disqualifying him. Mankind then picked up the steel steps and went to drop them on Rock but was met with a chair shot through the steps, causing them to drop the steps on himself and Rock unleashed a myriad of chair shots on the steps into Mankind. The match turned dirtier when it returned to the ring, with Mankind desperately low blowing The Rock and then following it up by biting Rock's face, again with the referee not ending it. As The Rock crawled outside of the ring to escape the biting, Mankind followed him and pushed him onto the announce table, continuing to bite him and landing a leg drop. He could not make Rock lay down for three in the ring though and after another sleeper hold, Rock began to fight back with a flurry of punches and reversing Mankind's back toss into a DDT. With Rock thrown out the ring, Mankind tried to elbow drop him from the second rope but ended up going through the Spanish announce table on his own. After using bits of the table to hit Mankind, Mankind was thrown back into the ring and kicked out of the People's Elbow and then hit a double-armed DDT from a running Rock. Mankind then took out Mr. Socko—a disgusting gym sock—and stuffed it in The Rock's mouth with the mandible claw. The Rock nearly passed out due to the sock’s foul smell, but The Rock managed to withstand the sock and jump into the Rock Bottom. Rock then, much to the vocal surprise of the crowd, grabbed Mankind's legs and fixed him in the sharpshooter, using the top rope for leverage. In a reference to the infamous Montreal Screwjob which took place at the previous year's Survivor Series event, without anyone having submitted, Mr McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell and award the victory and the WWF Championship to The Rock.\nAfter the match, Mr. McMahon and Shane entered the ring with Mr. McMahon telling the audience how he had successfully screwed Steve Austin, Mankind and the people. When Mankind asked for an explanation, Rock delivered another Rock Bottom but as the three of them celebrated, Austin ran into the ring and was met with a beating from The Rock that he eventually fought back from, tossing Rock out of the ring before grabbing the Championship belt and throwing it on Rock. He then gave a stunner to the just-recovered Mankind as the pay-per-view ended.\nReception.\nThe event has received mixed reviews from critics, with the overall story of the show generally getting a positive reaction and the wrestling getting a negative reaction.\nIn 2018, Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 3.5 [Bad], stating, \"This show is remembered for the tournament, but it’s not good. There are only two matches that I’d consider enjoyable (Mankind/Austin and Mankind/Rock). Everything else is either flat out bad, like the Tag Team or Women’s Title matches, or was just used to further advance angles. It was kind of exactly what you’d expect from the Attitude Era. The in-ring stuff mostly lacked, but the storylines were advanced and there was a swerve.\" \nIn 2021, Michael Fitzgerald of Scott's Blog of Doom described the event as a \"Recommended Show (Depending on what kind of wrestling you like),\" stating, \"I can fully understand how this show would divide people. If you watch wrestling primarily for the actual wrestling and enjoy good matches, then you’ll probably hate this show because good wrestling is at a premium due to them essentially sacrificing all but 2-3 matches on the card in the name of advancing the story of the show itself. If you watch wrestling primarily for the soap opera and storyline elements then you will probably love this show because they absolutely nail that aspect here, with a great story being told throughout the night that pays off in the end. The twists and turns all make sense in the grand scheme of things and it’s a testament to how hot the WWF was at the time that they could tease the fans with a Rock babyface run and snatch it away, only to then do even better business as a result.\" \nIn 2022, John Canton of TJR Wrestling gave the event a rating of 8/10, stating, \"This is an example of great booking making a show awesome rather than amazing matches from top to bottom. The huge swerve at the end of the night made you want to see what would happen next. That’s what we want. I still liked the 1996 show more because there were better matches, but top to bottom this was an excellent pay-per-view.\"\nAftermath.\nThe immediate effects of the event, alongside The Rock turning heel by aligning himself with McMahon, was the creation of The Corporation. The following evening on Raw, McMahon declared The Rock to be the Corporate Champion and set about persuading other wrestlers down the roster to join with the promise of money and power. The first to join was Ken Shamrock, who demanded a match with the Big Boss Man for interfering in his match, but towards the end of the match both McMahons came to the ring and convinced him to join. They also tried to convince the New Age Outlaws to join, but after feigning an allegiance they revealed to be true to D-Generation X and had to defend their Tag Team Titles at and again the following night, which they lost after much interference. McMahon also introduced a new commissioner, Shawn Michaels, who also showed corporate bias before returning to his DX stable. In the following year The Corporation would become a large stable and would have a rivalry with The Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness.\nOn a more individual basis, Mankind's outrage at being screwed by Mr. McMahon led him to a title match at the subsequent pay-per-view, Rock Bottom. Despite winning the match, McMahon managed to manipulate the rules to make sure The Rock retained his title again but the first Raw of the new year saw Mankind win the title, leading to an \"I Quit\" match at the Royal Rumble, a match that became infamous for its brutality, as well as becoming one of the focuses of the \"Beyond the Mat\" documentary. This led to an empty arena match, a Last Man Standing match and finally a ladder match, with the title frequently changing hands until ultimately The Rock would go on to WrestleMania XV as champion, with Mankind finding his way into the main event as a special guest referee.\nAustin and Mr. McMahon's feud continued to escalate after he was cheated in the semi-finals. The following night on Raw he reminded McMahon and The Rock that when he was rehired by Shane, he was guaranteed a title match. The match was marred with interference though both from Corporate members, Mankind trying to find revenge on The Rock, and The Undertaker, who took a shovel to Austin. McMahon tried to use Undertaker as another blockade for Austin, setting him in a Buried Alive Match to prevent him entering the Royal Rumble. Austin won the Buried Alive Match and was placed in the Royal Rumble entering first opposite McMahon at number two, who went on to win the Rumble, Austin reclaimed his WrestleMania place the following and went on to win the title.\nX-Pac's neck injury was not mentioned on screen and Steven Regal left the company soon after for WCW, without making another appearance until 2000 (as William Regal). Marc Mero would also disappear from programming, firstly to support his wife, Sable, in her career before leaving the company altogether. Firstly he split with Jacqueline, blaming her for his losing streak and she went on to form Pretty Mean Sisters; then in a moment of cockiness he announced that he was so insulted by being forced to face Duane Gill that he would quit if he lost. Thanks to interference from the debuting Blue Meanie, Duane Gill (who had become Light Heavyweight Champion) won the match and Mero quit, making one last appearance at UK's Capital Carnage. Sable would disappear until the new year, when she became an active defender of the Women's Championship; fighting the likes of Luna Vachon and newcomer Tori and forming an alliance with Nicole Bass.\nTournament brackets.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n† Triple H was originally in the bracket set to face The Rock in the first round, but his injury prevented him from competing, and was replaced by Big Boss Man.&lt;br&gt;\n‡ Mankind's opponent in the first round was billed as a \"mystery opponent\"; it was not announced until match time that Gill was the opponent.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecifics"

        "text": "The 1999 Survivor Series was the 13th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on November 14, 1999, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. It was the second Survivor Series held at the Joe Louis Arena after the 1991 event.\nThe main event was a Triple Threat Match (a non-elimination match involving three wrestlers against each other) for the WWF Championship between Triple H, Big Show and The Rock. Big Show was a replacement for Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had been run down by a car earlier in the night (which was an angle for Austin to take time to recover from his injuries). In reality, Austin needed spinal surgery to repair damage stemming from a serious injury he sustained just over two years prior at SummerSlam 1997.\nThe undercard included the New Age Outlaws defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Al Snow and Mankind, Chyna defending the Intercontinental Championship against Chris Jericho, three four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match (including a Handicap match involving Big Show), as well as the WWF in-ring debut of Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest-running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 1999 event was the 13th event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on November 14, 1999, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nStorylines.\nSurvivor Series consisted of professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines that played out on \"Raw is War\" and \"SmackDown!\" — WWF's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a hero or a villain as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main rivalry heading into the event was between Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock over the WWF Championship. At No Mercy, Rock defeated British Bulldog in a standard wrestling match. Later that night, Rock challenged the winner of the WWF Championship Anything Goes match between Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin for the title. After issuing the challenge, Rock was attacked by Triple H with a sledgehammer. Later that night, Triple H defeated Austin to retain the title. On the October 18 episode of \"Raw is War\", Rock challenged Triple H to a match for the title at Survivor Series, because Rock was angered at the previous night's attack. Austin also issued a challenge and claimed that he deserved a title shot instead of Rock. The WWF Chairman Vince McMahon solved the situation by making a Triple Threat match between Triple H, Austin and Rock for the WWF Championship.\nAnother predominant rivalry heading into the event was between New Age Outlaws (Mr. Ass and Road Dogg) and Al Snow and Mankind for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the October 18 episode of \"Raw is War\", Mick Foley gave his Rock 'n' Sock Connection partner Rock, a copy of his book \"\". However, later that night, the same copy was discovered by Al Snow in a trashcan. He informed Foley about it. Foley confronted Rock about it. Rock denied doing so but Foley broke up the Rock 'n' Sock Connection. Later that night, Foley cost Rock and himself, the Tag Team Championship against The Hollys (Hardcore Holly and Crash Holly) by coming out for the match without wearing Mankind gear and leaving Rock to wrestle on his own. This allowed Hollys to defeat Rock and win the titles. On the October 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", Mankind and Rock had a match which ended in a disqualification when Val Venis interfered and attacked Mankind with his book. On the October 25 episode of \"Raw is War\", Mankind wrestled Triple H for the WWF Championship. Triple H was disqualified when Venis assaulted Mankind again, earning Mankind, a disqualification win. However, Al Snow came out to rescue Mankind from the assault. On the October 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", Mankind defeated Venis after distraction from Snow. As a result, Mankind and Snow formed a tag team. On the November 4 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Mankind and Snow defeated The Hollys to win the Tag Team Championship. On the November 8 episode of \"Raw is War\", New Age Outlaws defeated Mankind and Snow for the Tag Team Championship. This led to a title match between New Age Outlaws and Mankind and Snow for the Tag Team Championship.\nAt No Mercy, Chyna defeated Jeff Jarrett in a Good Housekeeping match to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. On the October 18 episode of \"Raw is War\", Chyna issued an open challenge, which was answered by Chris Jericho, whose insults prompted Chyna to attack him. Stevie Richards also got involved in Chyna and Jericho's rivalry. On the November 8 episode of \"Raw is War\", Jericho was scheduled to wrestle Chyna for the Intercontinental Championship at Survivor Series.\nOn the October 18 episode of \"Raw is War\", Big Boss Man challenged Big Show to a match and agreed to defend the WWF Hardcore Championship. Big Show accepted the challenge. However, before the match Big Show left the arena to check on his father, who had reportedly died (in storyline). The report was later revealed as a plan of Boss Man. On the October 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", an enraged Big Show attempted to attack Boss Man but Boss Man escaped. Big Show then assaulted the police officer. On the October 25 episode of \"Raw is War\", Boss Man distracted Big Show during his match with Prince Albert. Albert attacked Big Show from behind and Boss Man broke Big Show's father's watch with a hammer. As a result, Boss Man and Albert formed a new alliance. On the October 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", Al Snow had a match with Boss Man. However, Boss Man's ally, Albert continuously interfered in the match and the two attacked Snow, leading him to challenge both men to a Hardcore match in the parking lot. Later that night, Boss Man and Albert went to the parking lot to wrestle Snow but instead of Snow, Big Show appeared. He trapped Boss Man and Albert in a car, smashed it into pieces and pushed a dumpster on the top of the car. On the November 1 episode of \"Raw is War\", Boss Man and Albert attacked Big Show during an interview. On the November 8 episode of \"Raw is War\", a tribute was paid to Big Show's father on his death. Boss Man came out and insulted Big Show and his father. On the November 11 episode of \"SmackDown\", footage was shown of Boss Man interrupting the funeral, attacking Big Show and ruining the grave. This led to a Survivor Series match between Big Show's team (consisting of Kai En Tai (Funaki and Taka Michinoku) and The Blue Meanie) and Boss Man's team (consisting of Prince Albert, Viscera and Mideon). On the November 14 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\", Big Show attacked all of his team members, who withdrew from the team, making the match a 4-on-1 Survivor Series match.\nAt No Mercy, the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) defeated Edge and Christian in a Ladder match, which was the final round match in a tournament for the managerial services of Terri Runnels and a prize of $100,000. On the October 18 episode of \"Raw is War\", New Brood disbanded their relationship with Gangrel's New Brood stable, turning face in the process, and formed an alliance with their former enemies, Edge and Christian. The Holly Cousins defended the WWF Tag Team Championship against the Hardy Boyz on the October 21 episode of \"SmackDown\" and against Edge and Christian on the October 25 episode of \"Raw is War\". In the latter match, Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty Too Hotty) interfered, costing Edge and Christian the victory. The Hardy Boyz came out to rescue Edge and Christian and the four wrestlers cleared the ring of Too Cool and Hollys.

Big Show took advantage and chokeslammed Triple H to win the match and the WWF Championship.\nReception.\nIn 2014, Dylan Diot of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 5.0 [Not So Good], stating, \"This show felt more like an episode of Raw than a PPV. All of the classic Survivor Series elimination matches were thrown together, a majority of the show was taken over by the Stone Cold car angle, and the wrestling wasn't all that good with only two exceptions. If [you're] a Big Show fan and want to see his crowning moment since coming to the WWF early in the year, then this show is worth a look. Otherwise, nothing to see here.\"\nAftermath.\nAfter Big Show won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, he continued his rivalry with Big Boss Man. The next night on \"Raw\", Boss Man defeated The Rock in a Hardcore match, with help from Prince Albert, to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. At the new December pay-per-view, Armageddon, Big Show defeated Boss Man to retain the title.\nSince Stone Cold Steve Austin was hit with a car, the WWF Chairman Vince McMahon continuously blamed Triple H and D-Generation X for the attack. On the November 18 episode of \"SmackDown\", DX assaulted McMahon's Corporate Stooges (Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco). Sgt. Slaughter informed McMahon of the attack and told McMahon that Triple H had invited him to DX's locker room. McMahon went to the locker room, where Triple H warned McMahon not to make this personal. Later in the night, Triple H came down to the ring and blamed McMahon for his title loss at Survivor Series and then challenged McMahon to a match at Armageddon. Shortly after, footage was shown of backstage where the McMahon family had fallen down the stairs. On the November 22 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Vince destroyed a limousine carrying DX using his car. Although DX retreated, the limousine was destroyed. Later that night, police officers arrested Vince for assaulting DX; Triple H attacked the hand-cuffed Vince and later accused him of orchestrating the attack on Austin at Survivor Series. Shane McMahon came to his father's defense and informed Triple H that Vince would accept Triple H's challenge at Armageddon. On the November 29 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Vince's daughter Stephanie McMahon was supposed to (storyline) marry Test. The ceremony was interrupted by Triple H, who showed a video of himself and an unconscious Stephanie getting married. On the December 2 episode of \"SmackDown\", Triple H announced that his match against Vince at Armageddon would be a No Holds Barred match, and on the following episode of \"Raw Is War\" a further stipulation was added to the match. If Vince won the match, Triple H and Stephanie's marriage would be annulled but if Triple H won, he would be granted a WWF Championship match. At Armageddon, Triple H defeated Vince in a No Holds Barred match, after Stephanie betrayed Vince and helped Triple H in finishing Vince with a sledgehammer. It was later revealed that Rikishi had run over Austin on Triple H's orders.\nAustin later made his return at Backlash 2000 in April, where he helped The Rock defeat Triple H for the WWF Championship. This was Austin's first appearance since Survivor Series on six months prior."

In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2000 event was the 14th event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on November 19, 2000, at the Ice Palace in Tampa, Florida.\nStorylines.\nSurvivor Series featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on \"Raw is War\" and \"SmackDown!\"—WWF's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a hero or a villain as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main rivalry heading into the event was between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H. The rivalry dated back to previous year's Survivor Series, when Austin was run down by a car in the backstage area and was sidelined for one year. At No Mercy, Austin competed against Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match as it was Rikishi, who had run down Austin with the car at Survivor Series. On the November 6 edition of \"Raw is War\", Austin competed against Rikishi and Kurt Angle in a Handicap match. Austin was being double-teamed by Rikishi and Angle until Triple H came to his rescue and forced Angle and Rikishi to retreat. Triple H then assaulted Austin with the sledgehammer and was revealed as the mastermind behind Austin's attack as he wanted to protect his WWF Championship. On the November 9 edition of \"SmackDown!\", the WWF Commissioner Mick Foley announced that Austin and Triple H would compete in a match at Survivor Series. At the event, the match was made a No Holds Barred match.\nAnother predominant rivalry heading into the event was between Kurt Angle and The Undertaker over the WWF Championship.

This angered Kane and he knocked down Jericho through a nearby placed table. On the October 26 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Kane interfered in Jericho's WWF Championship title shot against Kurt Angle and attacked Jericho, causing Angle to retain the title by getting disqualified. Jericho retaliated by costing Kane a WWF Hardcore Championship match against Steve Blackman on the November 6 episode of \"Raw is War\". This eventually set up a match between Kane and Jericho at Survivor Series.\nAt No Mercy, Eddie Guerrero cost Chyna and Mr. Ass, their tag team match against Right to Censor (Steven Richards and Val Venis).

        "text": "The 2001 Survivor Series was the 15th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on November 18, 2001, at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was the last Survivor Series to be produced under the WWF name, as the company would be forced to change its name several months later as the result of a verdict in the World Wildlife Fund's lawsuit against the company; the company became World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002. It was also the last Survivor Series held before the introduction of the brand extension in March 2002.\n8 matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Team WWF (The Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Kane, Big Show and The Rock) defeated The Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T and Shane McMahon) in a Winner Takes All 5-on-5 Survivor Series match. In other prominent matches, The Dudley Boyz (D-Von Dudley and Bubba Ray Dudley) defeated The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy) in a Steel Cage WCW World Tag Team Championship and WWF World Tag Team Championship unification match, Edge defeated Test in an WWE Intercontinental Championship and WCW United States Heavyweight Championship unification match and in the opening contest, Christian defeated Al Snow to retain the WWF European Championship. \nThe event marked the end of The Invasion angle, which had dominated WWF storylines since March when Vince McMahon purchased World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest-running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2001 event was the 15th event in the Survivor Series chronology and was scheduled to be held on November 18, 2001, at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nWWF Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Vince McMahon was originally supposed to be part of the main event, but was replaced by Big Show due to injury. In addition, a title unification match between WCW Cruiserweight Champion Tajiri and WWF Light Heavyweight Champion X-Pac was canceled because X-Pac was injured and unable to compete. To resolve this, the WWF retired the Light Heavyweight Championship shortly after Survivor Series in favor of the Cruiserweight Championship lineage, which was rebranded as a WWF title. The European Title match between Christian and Al Snow was neither announced nor built ahead of time, but was set up during a segment on the Sunday Night Heat program that aired before the PPV.\nStorylines.\nThe event featured eight professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWF script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during, and after the event. Storylines played out on the WWF's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nThe largest storyline that had pervaded the WWF in the preceding months was The Invasion, which came about due to the actual purchase of rival company World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by the WWF just prior to WrestleMania X-Seven. The storyline eventually grew into a WWF vs. WCW faction battle, and eventually Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) became a part of the battle by joining forces with WCW to create The Alliance.\nOn the October 22, 2001 episode of \"Raw\", Vince and Linda McMahon challenged Shane and Stephanie McMahon to a \"Winner Take All\" match to determine the fate of both companies, with the winning side continuing to stay in business while the losing side would be absorbed into the winner's company. However, Vince McMahon had to deal with multiple defections to the Alliance side, including Kurt Angle, as well as an increasingly heated feud between two of the WWF's biggest stars, The Rock and Chris Jericho, over the WCW Championship. Vince began spreading rumors to The Alliance that there was a mole within their faction. Upon hearing this rumor, Stone Cold Steve Austin came to the ring and asked Vince who it was. When Vince claimed it was Austin, Austin replied with a Stone Cold Stunner on Vince, and Vince continued to smile as he lay in the ring. Vince's spreading of rumors of a mole threatened to splinter the Alliance team while Shane rallied the team together by saying there was no mole, and Vince was trying to split the Alliance team apart. Meanwhile, The Rock continued to be suspicious of Chris Jericho, wondering if he was possibly going to switch on team WWF, given Jericho's history with both WCW &amp; ECW, while Jericho continued to deny it. On an episode of \"SmackDown!\" before the Survivor Series, Austin was the last man standing after both factions attacked each other in the ring. After that, Vince appeared on the entrance ramp and shared a smile with Austin, teasing that Austin would be the mole.\nEvent.\nBefore the event began, a dark match took place on Heat in which Lance Storm, Justin Credible, and Raven defeated Albert, Scotty 2 Hotty, and Spike Dudley.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe event opened with Christian defending the WWF European Championship against Al Snow, Snow performed the Snow-Plow on Christian for a near-fall. After Snow chased Christian, Christian kicked the middle rope into Snow. Christian performed the Unprettier on Snow to retain the title.\nNext, William Regal faced Tajiri. Regal performed a Regal Bomb on Tajiri to win the match.\nAfter that, WCW United States Champion Edge faced WWF Intercontinental Champion Test in a title unification match. Test performed a Pumphandle Slam on Edge for a near-fall. Edge performed a Spear on Test for a near-fall. Test attempted a Full Nelson Slam on Edge but Edge countered the move into a Roll Up to win the match.\nLater, WCW Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) faced WWF Tag Team Champions The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) in a Steel Cage match to unify the titles. Stacy Keibler stole the cage door key off a referee and passed Bubba and D-Von a table. Matt prevented a 3D and escaped the cage. Jeff attempted a Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage through the table on D-Von but D-Von avoided the move, causing Jeff to fall through the table. Bubba pinned Jeff to win the match.\nNext was an Immunity Battle Royal featuring members of both factions. The winner of the match would be protected from being fired for one year regardless of whether the WWF or Alliance won in the main event. Shawn Stasiak was eliminated by The APA before the bell rang. Tazz, Hugh Morrus and Chavo Guerrero entered the match at various points of the match. Test won the match by last eliminating Billy Gunn.\nAfter that, Trish Stratus, Lita, Jacqueline, Mighty Molly, Jazz and Ivory wrestled in a 6-Pack Challenge for the vacant WWF Women's Championship. Trish performed the Stratusfaction on Ivory to win the title.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show) faced The Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle, Booker T, and Shane McMahon) in a winner take all 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match. Big Show was eliminated by Shane after a Leap of Faith. Shane was eliminated by Jericho after a Lionsault. Kane was eliminated by Van Dam after a Diving Thrust Kick. Undertaker was eliminated by Angle after Austin performed a Stone Cold Stunner on Undertaker and placed Angle on top of him. Booker was eliminated by Rock with a Roll Up. Van Dam was eliminated by Jericho after a Breakdown. Angle was eliminated after Rock forced Angle to submit to the Sharpshooter. Jericho was eliminated by Austin with a Roll Up. Jericho attacked Rock with a Breakdown and Austin pinned Rock for a near-fall. Austin applied the Sharpshooter on Rock but Rock touched the ring ropes, forcing Austin to break the hold. Rock applied the Sharpshooter on Austin but Austin touched the ring ropes, forcing Rock to break the hold. Rock performed a Stone Cold Stunner on Austin but Nick Patrick pulled Earl Hebner out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. Austin performed a Rock Bottom on Rock for a near-fall. Austin attacked Patrick and checked on Hebner but Rock pushed Austin into Hebner after an attempted Stunner from Austin. Rock attempted a Rock Bottom on Austin but Austin reversed it and performed a Stone Cold Stunner on Rock, but no referee was there to make the count when Austin covered him. While Austin tried to revive Hebner, Angle returned and hit Austin with the WWF Championship belt. Rock performed a Rock Bottom on Austin to win the match, putting the Alliance (WCW/ECW) out of business. After the match, Vince McMahon appeared on the entrance ramp and celebrated with The Rock.\nReception.\nIn 2008, J.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.5 [Good], writing, \"The actual survival match at the end is pretty good, but it's just more Rock/Austin, something that would have happened had the WCW buyout never occurred. Everything else was somewhere in the middle. The Hardyz and Dudleyz was played out, but at least it was a catalyst for the teased breakup of the Hardyz a few weeks later. With everyone else, it became a game of \"how do we put this person over without actually putting them over anyone else?\" That's why most of the midcard wound up treading water until the brand extension. I'll call this a recommended show for the main event and for historical reasons -- just not the ones the WWF was hoping for.\"\nAftermath.\nThe next night on \"Raw\", Vince McMahon announced that the WCW Championship held by The Rock had become unbranded due to the dissolution of the Alliance and would be referred to simply as the World Championship. Several Alliance members were allowed to keep their jobs. Christian, The Dudley Boyz, and Rob Van Dam were all holding championships following the Alliance's loss (Christian was the WWF European Champion, the Dudley Boyz were the WWF Tag Team Champions, and Van Dam was the WWF Hardcore Champion). In addition, Stacy Keibler was able to stay employed due to her status as the valet for the Dudley Boyz and Test was able to after winning the Immunity Battle Royal. McMahon also debuted the infamous \"Kiss My Ass Club\" that night, where he said that an Alliance member- in this case Alliance Commissioner William Regal – would have to literally kiss his ass to keep his job.\nAt the very top of the show, Paul Heyman was the first Alliance member fired. Furious over being fired, Heyman lunged at his now-former broadcast partner Jim Ross. The audience delighted in seeing Ross pummel Heyman before he was carted off by security. To replace him, Jerry Lawler was brought back, making his first appearance since his resignation from the company in the end of February after No Way Out. The Alliance co-owners, Shane and Stephanie McMahon, were called to the ring to answer for what they did. While Shane accepted his defeat and walked away, Stephanie tried to plead for her job, but was escorted from the ring by WWF security per orders by the WWF chairman Vince McMahon.\nBased on his actions at the end of the WWF vs. Alliance Survivor Series match, for the majority of \"Raw\" Kurt Angle went around the backstage area portraying himself as the man who saved the WWF and wanting to be praised for doing so. Instead of that, Angle drew the ire of several WWF superstars including The Rock, who defeated him later that night. After the match Chris Jericho, who had been feuding with The Rock in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series over the newly rechristened World Championship, attacked him to reignite their feud.\nDespite his self-congratulating attitude, no one found Angle to be the conquering hero he was portraying himself as and by the end of \"Raw\" he was depressed and told Vince McMahon that no one appreciated him. McMahon agreed with Angle and looked for a way to reward him.\nThat reward came in the ring moments later, as McMahon was about to announce the stripping of the WWF Championship from Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had not yet appeared on the show. McMahon's intent was to award it to Kurt Angle as a token of his appreciation for Angle's actions at Survivor Series. However, before he could do so he was interrupted by Ric Flair, who returned to a WWF ring for the first time since January 1993. Flair then happily told McMahon that he \"had bet on a winner last night,\" and said to a surprised McMahon that when Shane and Stephanie sold their stock in the WWF to purchase WCW and ECW, he was the consortium who had bought the stock, and as such, he was co-owner of the WWF and he and McMahon were now partners.\nAustin then angrily returned, promptly going to the ring and attacking Angle, and then McMahon when he tried to intervene, while Flair idly stood by. Austin then became a face for the first time since WrestleMania X-Seven, when he reclaimed his WWF Championship, and celebrated with beers with Flair in the ring.\nOver the coming weeks the WWF decided what to do with the world championship situation, as there were now two world championships in the company. A tournament at Vengeance was conceived, where Austin and Angle would face each other for the WWF Championship and The Rock and Jericho would face each other for the World Championship. After those two matches, the winners would face off in one final match to unify both championships. Austin defeated Angle to retain the WWF Championship while Jericho defeated The Rock to win the World Championship. In the finals Jericho defeated Austin due to outside interference from Booker T to become the first ever Undisputed WWF Champion. As a measure of payback, Austin would go on to beat up Booker T in a supermarket on an episode of \"SmackDown!.\" followed by a Bingo game at a Church during an episode of \"Raw\" after Booker T smashed the windows of Stone Cold's Pickup truck.\nThis was the last Survivor Series to be held before the introduction of the first brand extension in March 2002, which split the roster into two distinct brands, Raw and SmackDown!, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. It was also the last Survivor Series under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002."

        "text": "The 2002 Survivor Series was the 16th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on November 17, 2002, from Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The official theme song was \"Always\" by Saliva, who performed the song and Chris Jericho's entrance music live from The World. This was the first Survivor Series held under the WWE name, after the promotion was renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May, and also the first Survivor Series held under the first brand split.\nThe main event from the Raw brand was the first-ever Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship involving reigning champion Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Kane. Michaels won the match after last eliminating Triple H. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was Brock Lesnar versus Big Show for the WWE Championship, which Big Show won to win the title. The featured match on the undercard was a triple threat elimination tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship involving Edge and Rey Mysterio, Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero), and Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. Los Guerreros won the match and became WWE Tag Team Champions after last eliminating Edge and Mysterio. This was the second Survivor Series event not to include any Survivor Series elimination matches, the first being in 1998.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, referred to as the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring until its discontinuation after its 2002 event. The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches pitting teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2002 event, however, did not feature such match, and was the second of only two times a Survivor Series match did not occur at the titular event—the first was at the 1998 event. In place of the Survivor Series match, the 2002 event included the first-ever Elimination Chamber match, in addition to an elimination tables match and a triple threat elimination tag team match. The 2002 event was the 16th event in the Survivor Series chronology. It was scheduled to be held on November 17, 2002, from Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The official theme song of the event was \"Always\" by Saliva. The band performed the song and Chris Jericho's entrance music live from The World.\nThis was the first Survivor Series to be held under the first brand extension introduced in March, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform; Survivor Series featured wrestlers from both brands. It was also the first Survivor Series held under the WWE name, following the renaming of the company from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May. It was also the first Survivor Series to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, following its introduction on Raw in September after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown! and renamed to WWE Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during, and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands – Raw and SmackDown! – while storylines played out on their weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nWorld championship matches.\nThe main feud heading into Survivor Series on the Raw brand was between Triple H, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Kane, Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels over the World Heavyweight Championship. The feud started on the September 2 episode of \"Raw\" when Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship in the form of the Big Gold Belt. Later on that edition, Triple H successfully defended the title over Ric Flair but lost in a tag team match to both Ric Flair and Rob Van Dam towards the end of the show. On the September 9 episode of \"Raw\", Rob Van Dam became the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Chris Jericho, Jeff Hardy, and Big Show in a fatal four-way elimination match. On the September 16 episode of \"Raw\", Van Dam lost the WWE Intercontinental Championship to Chris Jericho after interference by Triple H. At Unforgiven, Van Dam faced Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost after Ric Flair hit him with the sledgehammer, allowing Triple H to finish him off with the pedigree, thus retaining the title. On the September 30 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H defeated Bubba Ray Dudley to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, Kane won the Intercontinental Championship from Jericho despite interference from Triple H and Ric Flair. The match was made between Triple H and Kane for No Mercy in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. On the October 7 episode of \"Raw\", Kane successfully singlehandedly defended the World Tag Team Championship (that he had won on September 23) in a four team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match as The Hurricane had been attacked earlier that evening (by Triple H and Ric Flair) and was thus unable to compete. On the October 14 episode of \"Raw\", Kane and The Hurricane lost the tag titles to Christian and Jericho. Later that night, Triple H defeated Van Dam in a Canadian lumberjack strap match after Ric Flair nailed Van Dam from behind with the World title belt while the referee was distracted. At No Mercy, Triple H went on to defeat Kane in the title unification match, winning the Intercontinental Championship and unifying it with the World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 21 episode of \"Raw\", Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced that the first ever Elimination Chamber match would take place at Survivor Series. Bischoff did this, as he wanted the Elimination Chamber match to be better than SmackDown!'s Hell in a Cell match at No Mercy. On the October 28 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff stated that the Elimination Chamber would be a combination of WWE's Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and WCW's War Games matches, in that a countdown timer comes from the Rumble and War Games, the enclosed cage format from War Games, and the elimination process from the Rumble and Series. Bischoff also added that the match will involve six superstars. This led to Bischoff revealing the six participants for the contest; Triple H, Chris Jericho, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Kane and Shawn Michaels. Later that night, when Triple H took on Kane in a Casket match, Shawn Michaels (who Triple H put out of action after their Unsanctioned Street Fight at SummerSlam) emerged from the casket and assaulted Triple H. To gain further payback, Michaels then nailed him with the Sweet Chin Music, allowing Kane to put Triple H in the casket and closed the lid to win the match. On the November 4 episode of \"Raw\", Booker T and Kane defeated Triple H and Jericho in a tag team match after Michaels interfered again. Afterwards, Michaels accepted the offer of being part of the Elimination Chamber match.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Brock Lesnar and Big Show over the WWE Championship. At No Mercy, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the title, pinning him after an \"F-5\". On the October 24 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Big Show was traded to the SmackDown! brand and immediately issued a challenge to Lesnar, who accepted later that night. Later that night, after Lesnar and Undertaker cut promos to one another, Big Show threw The Undertaker off the stage, thus injuring his neck.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net – 10/24 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com – 10/24 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the October 31 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Lesnar faced off against Rey Mysterio, which ended in a no contest after Big Show interfered and tossed Mysterio into the crowd.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net – 10/31 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com – 10/31 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the match ended, Big Show chokeslammed Lesnar through the announce table. On the November 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\", after Lesnar defeated Eddie Guerrero in a non-title match, Big Show attacked Lesnar and slammed him off the stage.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net – 11/07 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com – 11/07 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the November 14 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win, trying to talk him out of defending the title. Lesnar refused and decided to call Big Show to the ring. As Big Show came out, Lesnar drove him through the steel steps. Moments later, Lesnar took out Big Show with five chair shots then nailed him with the championship belt.\nUndercard matches.\nThe other main feud on the card was between three tag teams, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, Edge and Rey Mysterio, and Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero), over the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the October 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\", General Manager, Stephanie McMahon announced an eight team tournament to determine the inaugural WWE Tag Team Champions that would conclude at No Mercy. Los Guerreros defeated Rikishi and Mark Henry in the first quarterfinal round. On the October 10 episode of \"SmackDown!\", in the second quarterfinal round, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit defeated John Cena and Billy Kidman while Edge and Rey Mysterio defeated Brock Lesnar and Tajiri to advance to the semifinals. On the October 17 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Edge and Mysterio defeated Reverend D-Von and Ron Simmons to advance to the finals. Later, Angle and Benoit advanced to the finals by defeating Los Guerreros. At No Mercy, Angle and Benoit defeated Edge and Mysterio in the finals to become the first WWE Tag Team Champions. On the October 24 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Edge and Rey Mysterio defeated Los Guerreros in a number one contenders tag match to earn a shot at the tag titles. Later that night, the WWE Tag Team Champions, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit fought each other in an Unforgiven rematch, which Benoit won after interference from Los Guerreros. On the October 31 episode of \"SmackDown!\", both Benoit and Angle cost one another their matches. Angle helped Edge defeat Benoit then later that night, Benoit returned the favor by helping Eddie Guerrero defeat Angle. Afterwards, Angle and Benoit brawled at the Halloween party, ending with Angle delivering an Angle slam and Benoit bashing the bottle into Angle's head at the same time, knocking each other down. On the November 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Angle and Benoit lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Edge and Mysterio in a 2 out of 3 falls match after Edge pinned Angle in the third and final fall.\nAnother feud coming from the Raw brand was between Victoria and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. At Unforgiven, Trish Stratus had captured her third Women's Championship from Victoria's mentor Molly Holly (who Trish lost the title to at King of the Ring). On the September 23 episode of \"Raw\", Stratus successfully defended the Women's title against both Molly Holly and Victoria in a Triple Threat match. Then on the September 30 episode of \"Raw\", Victoria challenged Stratus for the Women's title in a one-on-one contest but got Disqualified after hitting Stratus with a steel chair. On the October 7 episode of \"Raw\", after Stratus defeated Stacy Keibler in a Bra and Panties/Paddle on a Pole match, Victoria attacked Stratus and performed a Moonsault on her. Victoria claimed in the interview that back in their days as fitness models, WWE wanted both of them but Trish stole her spot. The two fought again for the Women's Championship at No Mercy with Stratus retaining. For the following four weeks, the two would have many clashes on Raw including on the November 11 episode of \"Raw\", when Stratus ambushed Victoria following Victoria's attack on Terri Runnels. It was announced that the title would be put on the line in a hardcore rules match.\nOn the November 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Billy Kidman and Torrie Wilson defeated the WWE Cruiserweight Champion Jamie Noble and Nidia in a mixed tag team match after Kidman pinned Noble. The following week on \"SmackDown!\", Kidman pinned Noble for the second consecutive time in a non-title match, handing Noble, his first singles loss in WWE. This led to a match between the two for the Cruiserweight Championship at Survivor Series.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and William Regal) defeated The Hurricane and Goldust in a match that aired on \"Sunday Night Heat\" which was originally advertised to be on the main card.\nThe first match of the event was an Elimination Tables match as Jeff Hardy, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley) faced 3-Minute Warning (Rosey, Jamal) and Rico. Spike was eliminated first as Rosey and Jamal performed a Double Flapjack on him. Rosey was next to go, as he was eliminated by Jeff Hardy with a Swanton Bomb. A miscue was picked up on the audio, as Rico was supposed to be knocked off the top rope, by Hardy, and Rico could be heard yelling in frustration \"Come on Jeff, goddammit!\" With Hardy lying on the ground, outside of the ring, the remaining 3-Minute Warning member, Jamal, delivered a diving splash off the top rope through a table on Hardy, eliminating Hardy from the match. At this point it was down to Jamal and Rico against Bubba Ray. As Bubba Ray fought for his team, he eliminated Jamal after performing a Top-Rope Powerbomb. D-Von Dudley appeared, and along with Bubba Ray, they performed the 3D onto Rico for the win.\nThe next match was for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, with reigning champion Jamie Noble taking on Billy Kidman. Nidia accompanied Noble to the ring, and interfered with many parts of the match, including slapping Kidman across the face. Noble went after Kidman, but missed, and knocked Nidia off the apron. Kidman managed to hit the Shooting star press for the win. Billy Kidman was named Cruiserweight Champion.\nThe third match was for the WWE Women's Championship. It was a Hardcore match with reigning champion Trish Stratus taking on Victoria. Victoria choked Trish with a broomstick at the turnbuckle and hit her with a trash can lid. Trish recovered, and sent Victoria into an ironing board before hitting her several times with a Singapore cane. Victoria (with a bloody nose), went under the ring, and came back out with a fire extinguisher. Victoria sprayed Trish with the extinguisher and gave her a suplex, capturing the Women's title.\nThe fourth match was the match between Brock Lesnar and Big Show for the WWE Championship. Lesnar came into the match with injured ribs, which Big Show took advantage of earlier into the match. However, Lesnar gained control over Big Show and executed an F-5 but Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring. Big Show hit Lesnar in the ribs with a chair, chokeslammed Lesnar onto it and pinned Lesnar, winning the match and the WWE Championship.\nThe final match on the undercard was a Triple threat Tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship between the teams of Edge and Rey Mysterio, Los Guerreros (Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero), and Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. A back and forth match between the three teams, until Edge delivered a Spear to Benoit, eliminating the team of Angle and Benoit. The final elimination was the team of Edge and Mysterio, when Eddie forced Mysterio to submit to the Lasso from El Paso, thus Los Guerreros winning the match and the WWE Tag Team Championship. After the match, Scott Steiner made his return to WWE, and attacked Christopher Nowinski and Matt Hardy after they had given an insulting promo about New York City and its citizens.\nMain event match.\nThe main event was the first-ever Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Triple H, Rob Van Dam, Kane, Chris Jericho, Booker T, and Shawn Michaels. The match started off with Triple H facing off against Van Dam, while the remaining four superstars were locked in the four chambers. Superstars entered the match at five-minute intervals. Van Dam controlled much of the beginning against Triple H. The next entrant was Jericho. Jericho and Triple H doubled teamed Van Dam until the next entrant entered. The fourth entrant, Booker T then made his way into the match. Van Dam delivered a Five Star Frog Splash onto Triple H of the top of a pod, legitimately damaging the latter's throat. Booker T would capitalize on this and delivered a Missile Dropkick to Van Dam to eliminate him from the match. However, Booker T would be the next elimination after Jericho pinned him following a Lionsault. The fifth entrant, Kane, dominated upon his entry into the match. The sixth entrant, Michaels, experienced brief control only to be chokeslammed by Kane. However, Kane would be the third elimination after receiving a Superkick from Michaels, a Pedigree from Triple H, and finally a Lionsault from Jericho. Jericho would be the next elimination after Michaels pinned him following Sweet Chin Music. The final elimination was made when Michaels delivered Sweet Chin Music to Triple H and pinned him, thus winning the match and the World Heavyweight Championship. The show ended with Michaels embracing with his newly won championship inside the chamber as confetti dropped to end the event.\nReception.\nIn 2015, Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 9.0 [Amazing], writing, \"I remembered how great SummerSlam was but forgot how good Survivor Series was. The worst rating I gave out was just under three stars. Every single match was at the very least fun and we got all new Champions which is always intriguing. Seriously, one of the better shows I've reviewed and one of the best Survivor Series Pay-Per-Views.\" Maxwell Jacob Friedman stated watching the event live inspired him to want to become a world champion.\nAftermath.\nShawn Michaels and Triple H continued their feud over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the November 25 edition of \"Raw\", Michaels defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Rob Van Dam; however, Michaels retained the title by disqualification when Triple H attacked Van Dam. The following week on \"Raw\", Van Dam faced off against Triple H, with Michaels as Special Guest referee, to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon. Triple H defeated Van Dam to become the number one contender, and he and Michaels brawled with one another. The next week, on the December 9 edition of \"Raw\", Michaels attacked Triple H and Ric Flair with an iron shovel outside the arena. Michaels then smashed Triple H with a trash can, causing him to fall inside a dumpster. Shortly after, Michaels climbed to the top of a trailer and jumped off onto Triple H. At Armageddon, Triple H defeated Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell match to win the title. The first match was a Street fight, which Triple H won. The match that followed was a Steel Cage match, which Michaels won.

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on November 16, 2003, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.\nThe main event match on the Raw brand was for the World Heavyweight Championship between Goldberg and Triple H, which Goldberg won by pinfall after performing a Spear and Jackhammer. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Mr. McMahon, which Vince won after Kane interfered and helped Vince bury Undertaker. This would also be marked as The Undertaker's last appearance portraying The American Badass/Big Evil until 16 and a half years later at WrestleMania 36 in 2020, as he would return four months later at WrestleMania XX in his Deadman persona for the first time since mid-1999. The predominant match on the Raw brand was a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series match between Team Bischoff (Chris Jericho, Christian, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner and Mark Henry) and Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley, and D-Von Dudley). Team Bischoff won the match after Orton last eliminated Michaels, following interference from Batista. Another notable match featured an Ambulance match between Kane and Shane McMahon, which Kane won after throwing Shane into the ambulance.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2003 event was the 17th event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on November 16, 2003, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.\nStorylines.\nThe event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during, and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands – Raw and SmackDown! – while storylines played out on their weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nThe main feud on the Raw brand was between Goldberg and Triple H, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Triple H and Goldberg were involved in the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship. After Goldberg eliminated three other men in that match, he went after Triple H. At the end, Goldberg attempted another Spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg in the head with a sledgehammer for the win. On the August 25 episode of \"Raw\", Goldberg issued a one-on-one challenge to Triple H. Triple H came out and stated that he would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg at Unforgiven. Triple H added the stipulation that should Goldberg lose, he would retire from professional wrestling. At Unforgiven, Goldberg defeated Triple H when he performed a Jackhammer to win the title. On the September 29 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H made an announcement, offering a bounty of $100,000 to anyone who could successfully \"take out\" Goldberg. The first person that attempted to take the bounty was Steven Richards, but Goldberg quickly took him out. Many other people tried and failed to take him out including La Résistance, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer. It was during a World Heavyweight Championship match between Goldberg and Shawn Michaels on the October 20 episode of \"Raw\", however, that he was taken out. Batista ran-in, dragged Michaels out of the ring and, in storyline, assaulted him. Batista then entered the ring, and proceeded to attack Goldberg. He put a folding chair around Goldberg's ankle, before jumping off the middle rope onto the chair, in storyline, \"shattering\" Goldberg's ankle. Evolution then made their way to the ring, and gave the $100,000 bounty to Batista. With Goldberg seemingly out of action, Raw Co-General Manager Eric Bischoff looked set to present Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship on the October 27 episode of \"Raw\". The other Co-General Manager of Raw, Stone Cold Steve Austin came to the ring, however, and announced that Goldberg would be back to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. Goldberg got his revenge on Batista on the November 3 episode of \"Raw\" as he performed a spear to Batista. He attempted to injure Batista using the same technique that Batista used on Goldberg. Ric Flair tried to intervene, but he too got speared. Austin then announced that Batista and Goldberg would go one-on-one. On the November 10 episode of \"Raw\", Goldberg looked set to beat Batista, but Triple H interfered, signaling a Disqualification. Triple H got his signature Sledgehammer out from underneath the ring, and looked set to attack Goldberg with it, but Goldberg managed to fight back, and speared Triple H. Goldberg picked up the sledgehammer, and attacked Batista with it.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon and The Undertaker. At No Mercy, McMahon interfered in a WWE Championship Biker Chain match between the champion Brock Lesnar and Undertaker, helping Lesnar retain the title. Earlier, McMahon defeated his daughter Stephanie McMahon in an \"I Quit\" match. Due to a pre-match stipulation between the two, Stephanie had to quit her job as SmackDown! General Manager. On the October 23 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Vince announced Paul Heyman as the new SmackDown! General Manager. In his first act, Heyman booked a handicap match, with Undertaker facing Lesnar and The Big Show, with the stipulation that if Undertaker won, he could choose to face any superstar at any event. Heyman put many stipulations in Undertaker's way during the bout, but despite this and taking a huge beating, Undertaker won the match. Undertaker told McMahon that he would be competing in a Buried Alive match at Survivor Series against McMahon. On the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Heyman announced that he had given Undertaker time off until Survivor Series, which made McMahon very unhappy. McMahon stated that he would \"burn down Undertaker's house and order Undertaker's wife to be gang raped\" if Heyman didn't do anything about the Buried Alive match. Both Undertaker and McMahon were interviewed on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown!\". In his promo, Undertaker stated that the feud with McMahon was personal. He went on to say that McMahon respected nobody and that McMahon respected his family much less. Later, McMahon asked for forgiveness from the fans for his actions over the past few months.\nThe secondary feud from Raw brand heading into the event was between the two Co-General Managers on Raw, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff. Bischoff had control of the brand since July 15, 2002, but on the April 28 episode of \"Raw\", he was forced to share his General Manager duties with Austin. Their feud over who had the most power as General Manager continued on \"Raw\" throughout the summer. On the July 21 episode of \"Raw\", Linda McMahon put a restriction on Austin, saying that he could not physically assault the other Raw superstars unless physically provoked. On the October 20 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff proposed that he and Austin should face off in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series match, with both selecting teams of five and the stipulation being if Austin's team were to win, then the restriction that McMahon had put on Austin previously would be null and void; however, if Bischoff's team were to win, Austin would step down as Co-General Manager of Raw. Austin promptly accepted the challenge, with Bischoff announcing the first two members of his team as Scott Steiner and Chris Jericho. Later in the night, Booker T was announced as the first member of Austin's Survivor Series team. On the October 27 episode of \"Raw\", Rob Van Dam and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) were named as members of Austin's team. For Team Bischoff, Christian and Mark Henry were announced as members as well. On the November 3 episode of \"Raw\", both Austin and Bischoff announced their final members to join their respective team; Shawn Michaels accepted Austin's invitation to join his team and Bischoff announced as Randy Orton the last member to join his team. On the November 10 episode of \"Raw\", Team Austin and Team Bischoff were scheduled four matches with Team Austin winning all four matches. In a tag team match, the Dudley Boyz defeated Steiner and Henry via disqualification, while in three singles matches, Van Dam defeated Christian, Booker defeated Jericho, and Michaels defeated Orton to get the greater advantage heading into Survivor Series.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, a \"Sunday Night Heat\" match was aired, which saw Tajiri (with Akio and Sakoda) retain the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Jamie Noble. Tajiri pinned Noble after a Buzzsaw Kick.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match of the event was the Survivor Series match with Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Hardcore Holly, and Bradshaw) against Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, The Big Show, Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones and A-Train). Holly was eliminated as he was disqualified for pushing the referee while attacking Lesnar before the match. A-Train was then eliminated by Bradshaw after a Clothesline From Hell. Bradshaw was then eliminated after a Chokeslam by Big Show. Matt Morgan was eliminated by Angle after an Angle Slam. Jones was eliminated by Angle after he submitted to the Ankle Lock. Angle was eliminated by Lesnar after an F-5. Lesnar was eliminated by Benoit after he submitted to the Crippler Crossface. Big Show was eliminated after a chain shot and an FU by John Cena, leaving Cena and Benoit as the survivors.\nThe next match was for the WWE Women's Championship between Molly Holly and Lita. After Lita missed a Litasault, Molly executed the Molly-Go-Round for a near-fall. Molly performed a drop toe hold on Lita into an exposed turnbuckle and pinned her to retain the title.\nThe third match was an Ambulance match between Shane McMahon and Kane. The match started on the outside, where Shane was thrown into the steel steps by Kane. Mid-way in the match, Shane executed a Leap of Faith through a broadcast table on Kane. Shane hit Kane with a kendo stick and tackled Kane through a security booth with an SUV. Shane executed a Coast-To-Coast off the roof of the ambulance on Kane. In the end, Kane executed a Tombstone Piledriver on the floor on Shane and threw him into the ambulance to win the match.\nThe fourth match was between The Basham Brothers (Doug Basham and Danny Basham) and Los Guerreros (Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero) for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The match started on the outside. Los Guerreros attacked Shaniqua, who tried to interfere. After Chavo accidentally attacked Eddie, Danny pinned Chavo with a roll-up to win the match for his team.\nMain event matches.\nThe fifth match was the second Survivor Series match with Team Bischoff (Chris Jericho, Christian, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner and Mark Henry) against Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Steiner was eliminated by Booker after a Book-end. Booker was eliminated by Henry after a World's Strongest Slam. Henry was eliminated by Van Dam and The Dudley Boyz after a 3-D from Bubba Ray and D-Von and Five-Star Frog splash. Van Dam was eliminated by Orton after an RKO. D-Von was eliminated by Jericho after a Flashback. Bubba Ray was eliminated by Christian after an Unprettier. Christian was eliminated by Michaels after Sweet Chin Music. Jericho was eliminated after Michaels countered the Walls of Jericho into a Cradle. After the referee was knocked down and Austin brawled with Bischoff in the entrance way, Batista interfered and executed a Batista Bomb on Michaels. Orton pinned Michaels to win the match, leaving Orton as the sole survivor and meaning Austin lost his position as Co-General Manager of Raw.\nThe match that followed was the Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Mr. McMahon. Undertaker punched McMahon, resulting in McMahon bleeding. Undertaker hit McMahon in the head with one of the shovels. After Undertaker assaulted McMahon, he carried him to the grave site. McMahon hit the Undertaker with a shovel, which resulted in Undertaker falling to the grave site, but he pulled McMahon into it. Undertaker climbed to a front loader but an explosion knocked him out. Kane interfered, attacked Undertaker and threw him into the grave. McMahon operated the front loader and dumped all the dirt from it to win the match.\nThe main event was between Goldberg and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. In the match, Triple H focused on Goldberg's injured ankle. Ric Flair, Randy Orton and Batista all interfered on behalf of Triple H; however, Goldberg hit Flair, Orton and Batista with a sledgehammer, which was brought in by Triple H. The match came to an end when Goldberg executed a Spear and Jackhammer on Triple H to retain the title.\nAftermath.\nThe Undertaker would return at WrestleMania 20 as his \"Phenom\" gimmick and defeated Kane.\nTriple H would win the World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg in a triple threat match also involving Kane. Randy Orton would also win the Intercontinental Championship from Rob Van Dam and Ric Flair and Batista would in the World Tag Team Championship on the same night. This meant Evolution held all the gold on Raw.\nChris Benoit would win the royal rumble match at Royal Rumble 2004 and win the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H in a triple threat match involving Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 20. He would close the show with Eddie Guerrero in the ring as confetti rained down on them.\nWWE would do a house tour in Australia where Nathan Jones announced he would leave WWE to stay in Australia.\nReception.\nIn February 2017, [Kevin Pantoja] gave the event a rating of 4.5 [Poor], stating \"There was one real standout here and that was the Team Austin vs Team Bischoff match. The other Survivor Series tag match was pretty good but the rest of the show was mediocre at best. The two McMahons vs Brothers of Destruction matches were a mixed bag and the Tag Team Title match was boring. Make sure you see Shawn Michaels' last stand but nothing else from this card is must see by any means.\"\nResults.\nSurvivor Series elimination matches.\nSmackDown!\nRaw"

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on November 14, 2004, at the Gund Arena (Now known as the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse) in Cleveland, Ohio. This is the first event to take place in Cleveland, Ohio but the fourth to take place in the state of Ohio (after the 1987,1988 and 1992 events) all took place in Richfield, Ohio.\nThe main event match on the Raw brand was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista, and Gene Snitsky), which Team Orton won after Orton last eliminated Triple H. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) versus Booker T for the WWE Championship, which JBL won by pinfall after hitting Booker with the title belt. The primary match on the undercard was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match between Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) and Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Carlito, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak), which Team Guerrero won after Big Show last eliminated Angle.\nSeveral of the existing feuds carried on following the event. Triple H continued feuding with Randy Orton, and at New Year's Revolution in January, Triple H last eliminated Orton in an Elimination Chamber match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield also continued his feud with Booker T, defeating him, Eddie Guerrero, and The Undertaker at Armageddon.

In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2004 event was the 18th event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on November 14, 2004, at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\nStorylines.\nThe event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during, and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands – Raw and SmackDown! – while storylines played out on their weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nThe main feud on the Raw brand was between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Gene Snitsky). On the October 25 episode of \"Raw\", Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) were put in charge of \"Raw\", after Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff took the night off. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch with Orton, as he lost a Steel Cage match to Orton at Taboo Tuesday. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series, and if he lost, he would never be allowed to challenge for the title again. Orton, however, lost the match after interference by Triple H, so Orton was banned from challenging for the World Heavyweight Championship. On the November 1 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff scheduled a traditional 4-on-4 elimination tag team match between Orton, Jericho, Maven and Benoit and Triple H, Batista, Edge and Snitsky at Survivor Series. The winning team at Survivor Series would be granted absolute control of running \"Raw\" for a month. On the November 8 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff concluded with adding that the winning members at Survivor Series would all get a week to be in charge of \"Raw\". That same night, Edge and Benoit were scheduled in a match, where Triple H, Batista, Orton, Jericho and Maven came out to ringside to watch the match. At ringside, a fight broke out between Triple H and Orton's team, which caused the match to end in a No Contest.\nThe predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) versus Booker T, with the two battling over JBL's WWE Championship. On the October 21 episode of \"SmackDown!\", SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long booked a six-man tag team match involving Booker, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL, Kenzo Suzuki, and René Duprée. At the time, Booker was a heel and congratulated JBL's success with the company in a segment backstage. The tag team match got underway, and JBL was led to believe that Booker was going to betray Van Dam and Mysterio, as Booker warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with Booker pinning JBL after an axe kick, thus turning Booker face. On the October 28 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Booker defeated Orlando Jordan to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 4 episode of \"SmackDown!\", JBL interfered in a match between Booker and Jordan, which ended in a disqualification, giving Booker T the win. After the disqualification by JBL, Theodore Long scheduled a tag team match between Booker and Josh Mathews versus JBL and Jordan. The tag team victory was given to Booker and Mathews, as Booker pinned Jordan for the win.\nOne of the primary matches on the SmackDown! brand was between Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam and John Cena) versus Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Carlito, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak).

Lita was disqualified for hitting Stratus with a chair, meaning Stratus retained the title. The match turned out to be an intensely violent affair where Stratus legitimately broke her nose after Lita slammed her into a chair, which caused Stratus to bleed. Sticking to her storyline of her being depressed after losing Kane's baby, Lita viciously attacked Stratus twice even after her nose was broken, with Lita apparently unaware of Stratus's legitimate injury.\nIn the sixth match John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) faced Booker T for the WWE Championship. before the match started JBL added a stipulation if he loses he would leave wrestling forever.

Booker T countered with a Book End on Jordan. JBL hit Booker T with the title belt and pinned him to retain the title.\nThe main event was the Survivor Series match between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) versus Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge, and Gene Snitsky) with the stipulation of the winning team being in charge of Raw for the next 4 weeks.

Edge was eliminated by Orton after an RKO. Triple H was eliminated by Orton after an RKO, leaving Orton as the sole survivor.\nAftermath.\nAs Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) defeated Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, they were given the opportunity to be in charge of \"Raw\" for a month; On the November 29 episode of \"Raw\", Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight Championship Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit's shoulders to touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight Championship, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of \"Raw\", Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee for the Elimination Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.\nAfter retaining the WWE Championship against Booker T, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) was inserted into previous feuds with Eddie Guerrero, Booker T, and The Undertaker. The feud led to SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long booking a Fatal Four-Way match at Armageddon in December. The match was won by JBL, as he pinned Booker T after a Clothesline from Hell and successfully retained the title.\nIn October, John Cena lost the WWE United States Championship to Carlito Caribbean Cool, who debuted on \"SmackDown!\". As part of the storyline, Carlito's bodyguard, Jesús, stabbed Cena in the kidney while at a nightclub. On the November 18 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Cena regained the United States Championship by defeating Carlito. Cena also debuted a \"custom made\" spinner-style title belt."

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on November 27, 2005, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan and consisted of six professional wrestling matches. This is the third event to take place in Detroit since the events in 1991 and 1999.\nIn the first of two main event matches, WWE Champion John Cena defeated Kurt Angle to retain his title. The second main event was an interpromotional 5-on-5 Survivor Series match, in which Team SmackDown! (Batista, Rey Mysterio, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), Bobby Lashley, and Randy Orton) defeated Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, The Big Show, Carlito, and Chris Masters) after Orton last eliminated Michaels. In another match, Triple H defeated Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2005 event was the 19th event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on November 27, 2005, at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nStorylines.\nThe event's card consisted of six professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands, while storylines played out on their weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nThe main leading rivalry leading into the event was between the Raw and SmackDown! brands as a whole, rather than individual wrestlers. The rivalry began on \"WWE Homecoming\", a special episode of \"Raw\" on October 3 when Raw's general manager Eric Bischoff stopped a match involving SmackDown! wrestlers by turning the lights out. In return, Bischoff's SmackDown! counterpart, Theodore Long, interrupted a Raw match. As a result, wrestlers from the two brands started a brawl and interfered in the other's show before facing each other in a tag team match at Taboo Tuesday; SmackDown!'s Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy defeated Raw's Chris Masters and Gene Snitsky. After Taboo Tuesday, Bischoff and Long agreed that teams from each brand would face each other in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series match, while the two managers would wrestle in a singles match at Survivor Series. The teams feuded on both shows, and Batista, the captain of the SmackDown! team, suffered an injury after being attacked several times. Qualifying matches for Team SmackDown! were held on the November 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", with Rey Mysterio defeating Randy Orton, Bobby Lashley defeating Orlando Jordan, Eddie Guerrero defeating Mr. Kennedy and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) defeating Chris Benoit. Guerrero was replaced by Randy Orton due to his sudden death on November 13.\nAnother rivalry heading into the event was between John Cena and Kurt Angle, over the WWE Championship. Their feud began in August, when Bischoff chose Angle as the number one contender to the WWE Championship after Cena defeated Chris Jericho in a You're Fired match to retain the WWE Championship, in which Bischoff was forced to fire Jericho, his #1 wrestler. Angle failed to win the title at Unforgiven, due to Cena being disqualified. The two squared off against each other again at Taboo Tuesday in a Triple Threat match that also included Shawn Michaels, and again Cena retained the title. On the November 7 edition of \"Raw\", Angle refused to compete in a tag team match pitting him and Chris Masters against Cena and Michaels due to the \"you suck\" chants from the audience. Angle finally agreed to compete if Bischoff silenced the crowd and let him have a special guest referee. Angle chose Daivari, who favoured Angle and Masters throughout the match and ultimately disqualified Cena and Michaels for using a chair, which he had ignored earlier when it had been used by Masters.\nThe rivalry between Triple H and Ric Flair began at \"WWE Homecoming\", when Triple H returned to WWE television after an absence of three months. The two had been aligned since 2002, as members of Evolution, and were partners in a tag team match on the show. After they won the match, Triple H attacked Flair with a sledgehammer. The week after, Triple H explained his actions, saying that he realized Flair was no longer the legend he was, and he needed to stop Flair. Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday, which Flair won. A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, a match was contested on Sunday Night Heat between Juventud (accompanied by Super Crazy and Psicosis) and Simon Dean, which Juventud won.\nThe first pay-per-view match was Booker T (accompanied by Sharmell) against Chris Benoit in the first match of their \"Best of 7 series\" for the vacant WWE United States Championship. The match started with Booker T exiting the ring when Benoit gained a slight advantage. The match went back and forth for the first half before Booker took control. The match saw interference by Sharmell, distracting Benoit, who was on the top ropes. After Benoit missed a diving headbutt, Booker T pinned Benoit, using the ropes for leverage, to win the match and take a 1–0 lead in the series.\nIn the following match, Trish Stratus (accompanied by Mickie James) defended her WWE Women's Championship against Melina (accompanied by Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro). Stratus immediately took control until Melina fought back. When Nitro and Mercury interfered, the referee ejected them from ringside. Melina kept control until Stratus fought back with forearm shots. Stratus pinned Melina after a diving bulldog to retain the title.\nNext, Triple H faced Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match. Flair was still on his way to the ring, when Triple H attacked him and gained the early advantage. After attacking Flair's head with a screwdriver, Triple H continued using foreign objects throughout the match, including a folding chair, a sledgehammer, and the steel steps. The match went back and forth between Triple H and Flair. Triple H attempted a Pedigree through a broadcast table but Flair countered the move into a back body drop through another broadcast table. Triple H later performed three Pedigrees on Flair but Flair got up each time. Triple H then hit Flair in the back with a sledgehammer, and Flair did not stand by the referee's ten count, giving Triple H the win. After the match, Edge and Lita came to the ring, and Edge announced that he would be hosting a new show on \"Raw\" entitled \"The Cutting Edge\". Edge noted that Dmitri Young was in the audience, and proceeded to criticize the sports teams of Detroit. Young replied by insulting Edge and his lack of a world championship.\nIn the fourth match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle was able to apply the ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked out of the ring by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw referee came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the referee, and executed an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led to Angle knocking down the referee. As the other referee was knocked out, SmackDown! referee Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on Angle, pinning him to retain the championship.\nIn the fifth match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by avoiding Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees up the ramp to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff to win the match.\nIn the main event, Team SmackDown! (Batista, Rey Mysterio, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, Bobby Lashley, and Randy Orton) faced Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, Big Show, Carlito, and Chris Masters) in the 5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match. Michaels eliminated Lashley after a chokeslam from Kane. Batista then eliminated Kane after a 619 from Mysterio and a spinebuster from Batista. Big Show eliminated Batista after a double chokeslam by Big Show and Kane. Mysterio eliminated Big Show after a Clothesline From Hell by JBL, a 619 from Mysterio, an RKO by Orton, another Clothesline from Hell by JBL and a seated senton by Mysterio. JBL eliminated Carlito after a Clothesline From Hell. Mysterio eliminated Masters after 619 and Droppin' Da Dime. Michaels eliminated both Mysterio and JBL after Sweet Chin Music. JBL distracted Michaels, which made Michaels execute Sweet Chin Music on JBL. As Michaels turned around, Orton executed an RKO on Michaels and to eliminate him, leaving Orton as the sole survivor. After the match, SmackDown! wrestlers came to the ring to celebrate with Orton when hooded figures carrying a casket came out. Lightning struck the casket and set it on fire; The Undertaker emerged attacking most of the wrestlers while Orton and his dad \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton evaded Undertaker by leaving the ring.\nAftermath.\nThe five-on-five Survivor Series match ended the rivalry between the brands. Eric Bischoff was fired as general manager of \"Raw\" by Vince McMahon, who took control of the \"Raw\" brand as temporary general manager of Raw. McMahon soon started to feud with Shawn Michaels, whom he lauded for his part in the Montreal Screwjob, when Michaels told McMahon to move on. This would lead to a feud with D-Generation X (DX) that lasted most of 2006.\nAfter Survivor Series, John Cena and Kurt Angle continued their feud. Before being fired, Bischoff had proposed that Cena should defend his WWE championship in an Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution. On the December 12 episode of \"Raw\", Kurt Angle, Carlito, Shawn Michaels, Chris Masters, and Kane won matches qualifying them for the Elimination Chamber match. After the qualifying matches, Cena faced Angle's associate, Daivari in a \"You Can't See Me\" match, as it would see Cena blindfolded during the match. Cena won as he made Daivari submit to the STFU. At New Year's Revolution, Cena also won the Elimination Chamber match, last eliminating Carlito, but immediately afterward, dropped the title to Edge, who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract following the match.\nRandy Orton and The Undertaker fought each other at Armageddon in a Hell in a Cell match, which the Undertaker won, ending their feud. Triple H moved on to feud with The Big Show, and Ric Flair feuded with Edge over the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Chris Benoit continued to feud with Booker T throughout the rest of the year and into 2006; their \"Best of Seven series\" concluded in January. Randy Orton, who was Booker's replacement due to a kayfabe injury, defeated Benoit in the seventh and final match, giving Booker the WWE United States Championship. However, Booker would lose the title to Benoit the following month at No Way Out.\nIn May 2006, WWE introduced a third brand dubbed ECW. The brand featured wrestlers from the former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion, as well as new talent."

        "text": "The 2006 Survivor Series was the 20th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on November 26, 2006, at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the first Survivor Series to include the ECW brand.\nThe main match on the SmackDown! brand was King Booker versus Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Batista won by pinfall after hitting Booker with the World Heavyweight Championship belt. The main match on the Raw and ECW brands was Team Cena (John Cena, Bobby Lashley, Kane, Sabu and Rob Van Dam) versus Team Big Show (Big Show, Test, Finlay, Montel Vontavious Porter and Umaga) in a 5 on 5 Survivor Series match. Team Cena won the match after Cena pinned Big Show last. The primary match on the SmackDown! brand was Chris Benoit versus Chavo Guerrero Jr. for the WWE United States Championship, which Benoit won after forcing Guerrero to submit to the Sharpshooter.\nMickie James defeated Lita with the Mickie DDT in Lita's retirement match to win the WWE Women's Championship. The main match on the card was Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, CM Punk and Matt Hardy) versus Team Rated-RKO (Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Mike Knox and Gregory Helms) in a 5 on 5 Survivor Series match. Team DX won the match after Triple H pinned Orton following a Pedigree. This marked the first time since the brand extension was created that wrestlers from different brands wrestled on the same Survivor Series team.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2006 event was the 20th event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brands. It was the first Survivor Series to include ECW, a relaunch of the former Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion that became a WWE brand in May, subsequently also being the first to feature the ECW World Championship (though the championship was not defended as the champion was involved in a Survivor Series match). The event was scheduled to be held on November 26, 2006, at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nStorylines.\nThe event consisted of seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The wrestlers portrayed their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during, and after the event. All wrestlers were from either one of the WWE's brands – Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW – while the storylines played out on their weekly television shows, \"Raw\", \"SmackDown!\", and \"ECW\".\nThe main feud heading into Survivor Series was between John Cena and Umaga. Umaga was Cena's latest challenge after Cena finished off the feud between King Booker and The Big Show at Cyber Sunday. On the November 13 episode of \"Raw\", Cena and Umaga finally fought in a singles match, but it was interrupted by the ECW World Champion The Big Show forcing it to a no-contest.\nThe primary feud on SmackDown! was between World Heavyweight Champion King Booker and Batista. Batista relinquished the title in Philadelphia at the Wachovia Center on the January 13 episode of \"SmackDown!\", the same exact location of Survivor Series due to a triceps injury. King Booker had already faced Batista and retained the World Heavyweight Championship at two pay-per-views (SummerSlam and No Mercy - the latter in a fatal four-way) since his return on the July 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\". This time, Theodore Long announced that the match at Survivor Series would be Batista's last chance to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Another feud was between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. Kennedy beat Undertaker at No Mercy by disqualification. On the November 10 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Kennedy challenged Undertaker once more bragging that he beat four former World Champions. The match was made into a First blood match.\nThe ECW brand was building up their \"Extreme Elimination Chamber\" match at December to Dismember. The contestants that were named to face the ECW World Champion The Big Show were: Rob Van Dam, Sabu, CM Punk, and Test. The final contestant was revealed on the November 21 edition of \"ECW\". It was Bobby Lashley, and he attacked Big Show during the in-ring segment.\nEvent.\nPrior to the event, Lauren Hart sang the United States national anthem. A non-televised match between Carlito and Charlie Haas took place, which Carlito won after a Backstabber.\nThe first match was a four-on-four Survivor Series match between Team Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Nicky and Mikey), with Mitch managing the team and Team WWE Legends (Ric Flair, Sgt. Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Ron Simmons), with Arn Anderson managing the team. Simmons was eliminated after being counted out, leading to the referee ejecting Anderson and Mitch. Nicky eliminated Slaughter after a Spinning Heel Kick by Johnny. Rhodes eliminated Nicky after a Bionic Elbow. Kenny eliminated Rhodes with a roll-up while holding Rhodes' jeans. Flair eliminated Mikey, using the ropes for leverage while pinning Mikey. Flair also eliminated Kenny with an inside cradle. Flair also eliminated Johnny after submitting to the Figure Four Leglock, leaving Flair as the sole survivor. After the match, The Spirit Squad attacked Flair.\nIn the second match, Chris Benoit faced Chavo Guerrero for the United States Championship. During the match, Chavo executed a Frog Splash on Benoit for a near-fall. Benoit accidentally knocked Vickie Guerrero off the apron when Chavo countered Benoit's attempt to apply the Sharpshooter. Benoit forced Chavo to submit to the Crippler Crossface to retain the title.\nNext, Lita defended the Women's Championship against Mickie James in Lita's \"last\" match, during which she had to endure \"she's a crack whore\" chants from the crowd. James performed the Tornado DDT to win back the title. After the match, Cryme Tyme came out and sold Lita's personal belongings to the audience which they stole in an earlier backstage segment, much to her shock and horror.\nThe next match was a traditional Survivor Series match between Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, and CM Punk) versus Team Rated-RKO (Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Gregory Helms, and Mike Knox). Knox was eliminated by Michaels after Sweet Chin Music while Knox was distracted by his then-girlfriend, Kelly Kelly. After the elimination, Michaels asked his team who he eliminated. Nitro was eliminated by Punk after submitting to the Anaconda Vice. Helms was then eliminated by Matt after a Twist of Fate by Matt and a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Edge was eliminated by Michaels after Sweet Chin Music. Orton was eliminated by Triple H after Sweet Chin Music by Michaels and a Pedigree, meaning Team DX won the match with no members eliminated.\nThe fifth match was a First blood match between Mr. Kennedy and The Undertaker. During the match, Kennedy started to cough blood but Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) provided Kennedy with a towel and cleaned the blood. Referee Charles Robinson did not notice that Kennedy was bleeding so the match continued. The match ended when MVP hit The Undertaker with a chair, causing him to bleed. After the match, The Undertaker went on an onslaught, hitting Mr. Kennedy with a hard chair shot making him bleed profusely, performed a Tombstone piledriver, then hitting Kennedy multiple times with his bare fist.\nThe next match was the traditional Survivor Series match between Team Cena (John Cena, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Kane, and Bobby Lashley) and Team Big Show (The Big Show, Test, Umaga, Finlay, and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP)). Umaga was eliminated after being disqualified for hitting Van Dam with a television monitor. Van Dam eliminated MVP after a chokeslam by Kane and a Five Star Frog Splash. Test eliminated Van Dam after a Running Big Boot. Sabu eliminated Test after a Springboard Tornado DDT. Big Show eliminated Sabu with a chokeslam. Kane was eliminated when Finlay hit Kane with a shillelagh and Big Show performed a Chokeslam on Kane. Lashley speared Finlay to eliminate him. Cena eliminated Big Show after a Spear by Lashley and an FU, leaving Cena and Lashley as the sole survivors.\nThe main event was between King Booker and Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. The stipulation was that if Batista lost, he would never get another shot at the World Heavyweight Championship, as long as Booker was the champion. Theodore Long announced before the match, if Booker had been disqualified or counted out, he would lose the championship to Batista. Batista executed a Spinebuster on Booker for a near-fall. Booker executed a Book End on Batista for a near-fall. Batista executed a Batista Bomb on Booker but Booker touched the bottom rope, voiding the pinfall. Batista almost executed a Batista Bomb on King Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell, but threw her out of the ring instead. Whilst the referee was tending to Sharmell, Booker attempted to hit Batista with the title belt but Batista countered and hit Booker with the belt. Batista pinned Booker to win the title in the same city where he had to surrender the title back in January earlier in the year.\nReception.\n411mania wrestling gave it a 4.5 out of 10 calling it \"boring\". \nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Ric Flair defeated all five members of the Spirit Squad. They were sick and tired of the Spirit Squad, so in a backstage segment, DX locked the Spirit Squad in a travel case and sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky via delivery man. That was the end of the Spirit Squad faction. As for DX's teammates at Survivor Series, The Hardys were challenged by the newly reunited team of MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury). Eventually, they had a tag team match at December to Dismember.\nVictoria earned a shot at the Women's Championship by defeating Melina, Torrie Wilson, Maria, and Candice Michelle in a battle royal. She eventually lost to the Women's Champion Mickie James at New Year's Revolution.\nWWE Champion John Cena was challenged by the undefeated Umaga the next night on \"Raw\". Cena accepted the challenge and they had the championship match at the next Raw pay-per-view, New Year's Revolution. Cena ended Umaga's winning streak to retain the championship.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown!\", General Manager Theodore Long announced Kane versus Montel Vontavious Porter in an Inferno match and The Undertaker versus Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match at Armageddon. This led to the reunification of The Brothers of Destruction versus Kennedy and MVP on the December 15 episode of \"SmackDown!\".\nThe ECW main feud was between Big Show and Bobby Lashley who signed a contract to be in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match on the November 14 of \"ECW\". At December to Dismember, Lashley became the new ECW World Champion by winning the Extreme Elimination Chamber match.\nAfter defeating King Booker at Survivor Series, Batista would go on to hold the World Heavyweight Championship for four months, defending it against Mr. Kennedy at the 2007 Royal Rumble. Batista would then finally lose the championship to The Undertaker, the winner of the 2007 Royal Rumble, at WrestleMania 23."

        "title": "2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 77th playing of the midseason exhibition baseball game between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 11, 2006 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The contest was the fifth hosted by the city of Pittsburgh – tying the Cleveland Indians for the record of most times hosted by a single franchise. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3–2, thus awarding the AL champion (which was eventually the Detroit Tigers) home-field advantage in the 2006 World Series.\nBackground.\nAs with each All-Star Game since 1970, the 8 starting position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and the All-Star Final Vote to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.\nThe game was the fourth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a nine-game unbeaten streak (eight wins, with one tie in 2002). Many analysts saw the disparity between the leagues as more pronounced than ever this season, as evidenced by the AL's dominance in interleague play, where its 154–98 record was the best for either league in the ten-year history of the format. This was primarily the result of a similar difference in team payrolls, many observers agreed. The AL boasted the four largest in the majors, while the NL had three of the four lowest among the 30 teams. At $194.7 million, the New York Yankees payroll was more than those of the Florida Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Pittsburgh Pirates and Milwaukee Brewers combined.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nNational League starting pitcher Brad Penny set the tone for the evening, striking out Ichiro Suzuki, Derek Jeter, and David Ortiz to start the game. His fastball had uncharacteristic speed, never going below 96 miles per hour, and – aside from a lone curveball – was the only pitch he threw in the first inning. American League pitcher Kenny Rogers wasn't as overpowering as Penny, but still escaped the first relatively unscathed. The AL would get to Penny in the second as Vladimir Guerrero hit an opposite-field home run that just cleared the right field fence, giving the AL a 1–0 lead. The NL would respond in the bottom of the inning with David Wright hitting his own home run to left field, tying the game at 1–1.\nRoy Halladay relieved Rogers in the bottom of the third. It was in this inning when the National League exemplified what it does best: playing small. Alfonso Soriano hit a single with one out and stole second base on Gold Glove catcher Iván Rodríguez. He tried to score on a single by Carlos Beltrán, but was thrown out at home plate by Vernon Wells. Beltran would advance to second on the throw, then steal third and score on a wild pitch by Halladay, giving the NL a 2–1 lead.\nThat lead would seem like enough for the NL for most of the evening. After Roy Oswalt relieved Penny in the third, Brandon Webb, Bronson Arroyo, Brian Fuentes, Derrick Turnbow, and Tom Gordon would each throw an inning of scoreless relief, limiting the AL to just three hits in that span. After Halladay pitched the fourth, Barry Zito, Scott Kazmir, Johan Santana, and B.J. Ryan would also each pitch an inning without giving up a run, with the only baserunner allowed on a walk by Santana, the only walk of the game.\nTrevor Hoffman came on to try to earn the save in the ninth. After inducing two groundouts back to himself, it seemed like Hoffman, who, at the time, was second all-time in career saves, would finally send the American League to a loss in an All-Star Game for the first time in a decade. However, Paul Konerko hit a single to left past third baseman Miguel Cabrera, and was pinch-run for by José Lopez. Troy Glaus hit a ground rule double down the left field line, forcing Lopez to hold at third. While it looked like the National League received a break (as Lopez could have possibly scored the tying run if the ball stayed in play), Hoffman allowed a two-strike triple to Michael Young, who went on to win the MVP, scoring Lopez and Glaus and putting the AL up 3–2.\nMariano Rivera would now try to save the game for the American League. Because Lopez pinch-ran for Konerko in the top of the ninth, the American League was left without any first basemen on the roster. Glaus, in the game as a third baseman, moved to first for the bottom of the inning, a position he never played before in his career, while Lopez played third. Despite an error made by Lopez, Rivera pitched a quiet ninth to earn the save and extend the American League's unbeaten streak to ten games.\nHome Run Derby.\nThe Century 21 Real Estate Home Run Derby was held on the Monday before the game, July 10. Four players from each league competed to hit as many home runs in each round to advance and eventually win the contest. This year's Derby featured an important rule change: home runs in the first round would carry over into the second round. In previous years, some players would hit a tremendous amount of home runs in the first round, but become tired by the second round and hit relatively fewer home runs for that round, often not enough to qualify for the finals. By allowing the home runs to carry over, a player can't necessarily be \"punished\" for hitting an impressive total in the first round. However, like in previous Derbies, the two finalists start over at zero for the finals.\nIn the finals, Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies defeated David Wright of the New York Mets 5–4, and hit a total of 23 home runs on the night, leading all competitors. Howard memorably hit his winning home run into a sign guaranteeing one person in the crowd 500 free round-trip flights from Southwest Airlines.\nPNC Park is distinct for having the Allegheny River running behind the right field bleachers. As a result, several balls were hit into the river on the fly (a feat that had only been accomplished once before in the stadium's regular-season history), as well as many more bouncing off the walkway alongside the river. Many fans waited in the river in canoes hoping to retrieve a ball, a sight more reminiscent of the following year's All-Star Game and Home Run Derby site, AT&amp;T Park.\nFor the second straight year, gold balls were utilized whenever a player had one out remaining in the round. Any home runs hit with the gold ball meant Major League Baseball and Century 21 would pledge to donate $21,000 (US) to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and Easter Seals, respectively. In all, 14 gold-ball home runs were hit, constituting $294,000 raised for both charities.\nOther events.\nFutures Game.\nThe eighth annual XM Satellite Radio Futures Game was held on Sunday, July 9, showcasing the top minor league prospects from all thirty major league clubs. Game MVP Billy Butler of the Kansas City Royals farm system hit a two-run home run to help lead the United States team to an 8–5 victory over the World team.\nRoberto Clemente ceremony.\nCommissioner Bud Selig presented the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award to deceased Pittsburgh Pirates legend Roberto Clemente between the fourth and fifth innings of the All-Star Game. Clemente's widow, Vera, accepted the award. FOX play-by-play announcer Joe Buck emceed the ceremony. As a result, he called the bottom of the fourth inning from the entrance behind home plate. Buck created a little controversy when after Vera Clemente spoke what many said was a beautiful, moving speech Buck asked the fans \"You guys having fun out here?!\""

        "title": "List of Olympic medalists in luge",
        "text": "Luge is one of the seven Olympic sports currently contested at the Winter Olympic Games. It has been a constant presence in the Olympic program since its introduction at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, in the form of three events: men's singles, women's singles, and doubles. A mixed team relay event was contested for the first time at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\nHistory.\nItalian luger Armin Zöggeler is the overall medal leader in the sport, having collected a total of six medals (two gold, one silver, and three bronze) in the men's singles, during the six Winter Games in which he competed (1994–2014). As of 2021, he is the only Olympian to receive six medals in the same event. German luger Georg Hackl was the first Olympian to receive a medal in five consecutive Olympics, from 1988-2002, including three consecutive gold medals.\nIn the women's event, Germany's Silke Kraushaar leads the medal count with three, one of each color. Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female individual gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the United Team of Germany, was the first woman to win the singles event in 1964. She was on the verge of defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, having the best overall time after all the runs, but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that the runners in their sleds had been illegally heated before the runs. Müller made up for this by taking the gold medal at the following Games, in Sapporo, Japan.\nThe most successful pair in the history of the Olympic doubles event was Stefan Krauße and Jan Behrendt, who represented East Germany in 1988 and the reunified German Olympic team from 1992 to 1998, winning four medals: two golds, one silver, and one bronze. East Germany's Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn, and Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger, are the other pairs to have won two times, both of them in consecutive Olympics. In 1972, two gold medals were awarded to an East German (Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow) and an Italian pair (Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner), who finished with exactly the same time. To prevent similar situations in future Olympics, the Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course introduced timing equipment that measured accurately to one thousandth of a second, to replace the old equipment that measured in hundredths of a second.\nAs of the 2018 Winter Olympics, 141 medals (48 gold, 46 silver, and 47 bronze, with two golds in the 1972 doubles event) have been awarded, representing 11 National Olympic Committees (NOC). German lugers—representing the United Team of Germany (1964), West Germany (1968–1988), East Germany (1968–1988), and Germany (1992–2018)—have dominated this sport, collecting a total of 81 medals. There were seven occasions when a single NOC filled the podium with its athletes and in all of them they were German. After 2018, Germany is the current medal-leading NOC in the sport with 37 medals (18 gold, 10 silver, and 9 bronze), followed by East Germany's 29 medals.\nStatistics.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes that have won at least two medals are listed below. Medalists are sorted first by the total number of medals, then successively by the number of gold, silver and bronze medals. If a tie is still verified, medalists are ordered chronologically by their first medal.\nMedal sweep events.\nThese are events in which athletes from one NOC won all three medals."

        "title": "Cross Country Cycling Classic",
        "text": "The Holy Saturday Cross Country Cycling Classic is a one-day amateur cycling race held in Belize every year during the Easter holidays. It is Belize's biggest cycling event and has begun to be recognized internationally.\nFormat of the race.\nThe race begins at 6:00 AM (previously 5:00 AM) on Holy Saturday morning, near Mile 2 on Belize's George Price Highway, a favorite road for cycling events. Recently there has been a lead-out from inside Belize City at the BTL Park with actual racing beginning on the highway. Cyclists race to the western town of San Ignacio, in the Cayo District, turn there and return to Belize City, finishing at the Marion Jones Sports Complex (formerly the National Stadium) with two laps on the asphalt track (more recently on flat straight portions of Princess Margaret Drive and Marine Parade while the Complex is under renovation). The estimated distance of the Classic is some 142.4 miles. Participation is limited mainly to amateur cyclists of any country, and cyclists from Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and the United States have participated. In addition to prizes awarded at the end of the race, station prizes are handed out at strategic points on the road going and coming. These prizes are usually cash donations, farm produce or certificates for trophies, jewelry and other items. Belizeans normally line the roadway to cheer on Belize's representatives in the race. While the cyclists are pushed toward Cayo by southeasterly or even easterly winds, a combination of those same fierce winds and the usual muggy conditions of Belize in the dry season traditionally faces cyclists on the return journey.\nHistory of the race.\nOriginal proposal.\nThe idea for the race originated with Belizean Monrad Metzgen, who on a trip to one of the villages on the Northern Highway in 1928 was struck by the number of bicycles Belizeans used to attend weekly cricket games in the Belize Rural area. He pitched an idea for a sort of cycling \"expedition\" to San Ignacio, testing the cyclists' ability to cope with a then-badly built Western Road (now George Price Highway), to the Governor, who immediately pledged support and offered a cup as a prize to the winner of the race. Other prominent Belizeans Monrad Metzgen spoke to, including medical officer Lieutenant Colonel James Cran, Matron L.M. Roberts of the Public Hospital, Royal Bank of Canada local manager Charles Beattie and Frans Dragten all donated money and trophies to the cause. The help of a young surveyor, Henry C. Fairweather, was also enlisted. On April 2, 1928, a parade and inspection of the cyclists was organized by Metzgen and attended by the Governor, Superintendent of Police and others, who congratulated the cyclists and sent them on a parade through the town's streets. Among the participants were two Cayo men, Cyril Simmons and Leonard Neal, who covered the journey between the two districts to prove it could be done and were specially commended for their daring. The official race kicked off on April 5, 1928 from in front of the courthouse at 5:00 AM. (Amandala)\nThe men traveled throughout the city and then hit the western road (or \"trail\" as some have called it) headed for Orange Walk, which was at that time the quickest connection to Cayo, though still 55 miles from Belize City (the cyclists expected to cover 90 miles on their trek).\nThe roads were terrible, and the first rider into Cayo, Elston Kerr, was cheered for making it into town in about 13 hours. The men stayed through the Easter holidays, feasting, eating, playing cricket and soaking up the accolades of the Cayo faithful. They also visited Benque Viejo and San Jose Succotz, the westernmost settled areas in Cayo.\nOn April 9, the expeditionists set off at 5:00 AM, their progress reliably reported through of the telephone service. Comments issued back and forth among the populace about the overall good humour of the expedition and its participants were praised for being pioneers and behaving modestly in spite of their achievement.\nKerr, of Burrell Boom, finished first in 21 hours 29 minutes, 81 minutes ahead of second place Norris Wade, also of Boom. Third place was Bertie Cleland in 24:37. Walter Scott, easily the youngest ever competitor at 13, took 50 hours to finish but was awarded a prize anyway. Race organizer Metzgen participated and finished in 30 and a half hours. The race led to the formation of the British Honduras Cycling Association in June. (Amandala; Cycling Association)\n1929-1950: Opening up the West.\nThe second race was organized for 1929, and Kerr beat David Graham for his second title, becoming the first repeat champion. Wade won over Kerr in 1930. The 1932 race was canceled due to the 1931 hurricane which devastated Belize City the previous September. Other early champions included brothers Robert and Goldburn Ferguson, Jose Sosa, Ben Sanchez and Hendicott Croft.\nToward the middle 1940s, Altreith Smith and Aston Gill emerged as the best cyclists. Smith won the first one-day event in 1948 and Aston Gill won four times between 1947 and 1951.\nDue to repair projects initiated on the Western Highway by Governor Alan Burns, some races were held on the Northern Highway. Donald Lightburn was the first winner on the Belize-Corozal circuit (in 1935 and 1936), followed by Jose Sosa in 1937 and 1938, Ben Sanchez in 1939, Goldburn Ferguson in 1942 and Aston Gill in 1947 (his 3rd victory). A few later races went to Orange Walk and back; this practice was discontinued after Mexico's Pablo Calderon won in 1971.\nCross Country Classic Winners 1929-1950\n1951-1973: The O'Brien and Miguel dynasties.\nBeginning in 1951, a young cyclist named Jeffrey O'Brien would become arguably the most dominant champion ever. He joined Gill as a four-time champion from 1951 to 1955. His chance at making that total five was interrupted by a most unusual race in 1953. The story goes that Cycling Association officials felt O'Brien was \"too\" dominant and might affect the sport's development. They planned a stratagem involving four junior riders (under eighteen) who would receive a half-hour headstart on the seniors. O'Brien and the peloton caught all but one, the eventual winner, Clinton Castillo. The incident has become a treasured part of Belizean cycling lore. O'Brien would retire in 1955 and never race again. But a new dynasty was to emerge, featuring a team of cycling brothers, the Miguels. Edward, Arthur, John and Rudy would share 11 of the next 13 Classics between them, though not without some controversy. In 1958, John Miguel's finish with contender Duncan Vernon was ruled a dead heat, the only one in Classic history. In 1961, brother Edward thought he had the race won and raised his hands in the air accordingly, only to be disqualified in favour of Vernon and Arthur Miguel. John won the most titles of the quartet with four, followed by Edward's three, and Arthur and Rudy with two each. Other winners during the period were Clinton Castillo in 1967 and Kenneth Sutherland. In 1971, an international participant won for the first time, Mexico's Pablo Calderon, but he won on the Northern Highway, where Cross Countries have occasionally been held. In 1972, Cayo's Anthony Hutchinson, nicknamed \"The Tank\", demolished Calderon and the Miguels for his first title on the Western Highway, then repeated in 1973 ahead of Kenrick Halliday, then an unknown. But Belizeans were soon to know all about him. (Cycling Association retrospective)\nCross Country Classic Winners 1951-1973\n1974-1989: The Doctor, Sparks and the Americans.\nKenrick Halliday was to achieve cycling glory in a most dramatic fashion. City born, handsome and talented on the bike, \"The Doctor\" as he was known seemed the perfect successor to Gill, O'Brien, the Miguels and Hutchinson. In 1974, Halliday won convincingly, and repeated in 1975. But this event is noted for rivalries, and one was born when Alfred \"Sparks\" Parks defeated the field in 1976 during Halliday's absence. \"Doc\" returned with a vengeance in 1977 and 1978, breaking a record set by O'Brien nearly a half-century before-on the day Halliday was born- but could only watch as Parks devastated the peloton in 1979 when he led the race from start to finish. Overall, Halliday won four titles to Parks' two and is regarded as the better sprinter. \nIn 1980, a special finish was witnessed at the Stadium as Alexander Vasquez outdueled twenty of his peers to win a field sprint. 1981 saw the arrival of Alpheus Williams, a precocious youngster who would go on to win three Classics before leaving Belize in 1985. Teammate Lindy Gillett set a record and became the youngest winner of a Classic at 18 in 1983; Robert Mossiah and Matthew Smiling took titles in 1985 and 1986, respectively. But in 1987, cyclists from the United States imported by Belizean team owners would put an end to the homegrown dominance. Ward Zauner broke Gillett's record in his 1987 win; Steve Steward and David Licker swept the top positions in 1988, and Frank \"Mac\" McCannon took the roses in 1989. These American winners rode a faster pace and were better sprinters, but Belizean sports fans figured they had the right person to beat them-if they could find out who that was.\nCross Country Classic Winners 1974-1989\n1990-present: Modern era.\nA panicky local Association restricted international competition in 1990, turning the race into a sort of contest for a \"Great Belizean Hope\" to bring down the Americans. He turned out to be Charles Lewis, who smashed Zauner's record and evoked memories of strong performances from previous champions. When McCannon led a team of Americans back to Belize in 1991, the nation pinned its hopes on Lewis to defeat them. He came through, breaking his own record and restoring the nation's pride. Lewis' effort began a sort of Belizean \"renaissance\" that lasted through 1995, as brother Michael, Collet \"Bunas\" Maheia, Orlando Chavarria and contenders Nigel Matus, Fred Usher and others defended Belize's honor. Adding to the memories was a pair of exciting and controversial finishes. In 1993, Roque Matus thought he had the race won, similar to Edward Miguel in 1961, and stopped riding after crossing the finish line at the BTL Park (formerly Ramada Park)-only it wasn't; this allowed Maheia to attack and win. The line was apparently left over from municipal elections work earlier that year. In 1994, the scene shifted south to the Yabra area. After Charles Lewis claimed first place over American Bobby Lee, brother Michael began the sprint for third- and crashed into a slow moving truck belonging to local communication company BTL and holding broadcasters from KREM FM covering the finish. The oncoming peloton could not avoid the melee and a huge spill developed which was blamed on the broadcasters. \nSince 1996, international cyclists have dominated. Cyclists from the U.S. have won 8 Classics, Mexico and Guatemala three each, and Belize five. Two of those belong to Ernest Meighan (1997, 2001), one to Shane Vasquez (2006) and one to Giovanni Choto (2012), while Darnell Barrow became the first Belizean to get back to back wins for Belize since 1995. A pattern has developed of younger Belizean cyclists and expendable foreign ones leading the race early, dropping back into the peloton, then allowing fresher, stronger, more well-known cyclists to step forward. Most Belizean teams bring in foreign riders to participate, then have to defend themselves to the outraged public when a foreigner wins. But that foreign participation also introduces Belizeans to fresh talent and provides for a real test of Belizean cyclists' capabilities.\nIn both 2007 and 2008, for instance, Team Western Spirit of Cayo brought in American Boyd Johnson to help defend the title. After two failed breaks on the return journey in cool weather, a nine-man field entered the Complex; in such circumstances defending champion Vasquez would have no advantage in a sprint. Vasquez led most of the last two laps but then made way for Johnson to win the sprint and the title, while he finished ninth. Save for Roger Troyer of Team Sagitun, no Belizean finished higher than fifth. The course record was lowered to 5 hours, 47 minutes, 23 seconds.\nIn 2008's race, foreigners dominated the Belmopan to Cayo section of the race as Guatemalans and Americans combined to lead breaks into Roaring Creek, where U.S. National under-23 rider Ryan Baumann left the field in a dominant solo run to the City. Notable is that due to construction projects at the MJSC which started this year and would continue for the next few years, this year's race finished on the Marine Parade Boulevard near Memorial Park. The course record was lowered to 5 hours, 40 minutes, 12 seconds.\nOn April 11, 2009, the cyclists pushed forward in sunny, dry conditions and a steady southeast breeze to Cayo. Mexican Antonio Rios and Costa Rican Marco Salas outran the field after an early breakaway and led the pack in and out of San Ignacio to Belmopan. Around mile 38, a group of six began what would become the final run to the City, including Belizean hopefuls Jose Choto and Giovanni Leslie. However, Mexicans Carlos Lopez and Carlos Manuel Hernandez left the pack around mile 12 and sprinted 1-2 to the Memorial Park, with Cuba's Frank Travieso taking third. Lopez became the first Mexican to win since 2002 and only the third overall. Belize's run of futility was extended to four years.\nMexicans Omar Garcia and Donizetti Vasquez dominated the first leg of the 2010 race on April 3, but on the return, the Belizean heavyweights hit back. Eventually, Guatemala's Miguel Perez and Venezuela's Wilmen Bravo led a group of eight into the City and Perez claimed Guatemala's first win since Gustavo Carillo in 2000.\nIn 2011, it was a Guatemalan one-two, as Luis Santizo stunned fellow Guatemalan Carlos Hernandez and Belize's main hope Darnell Barrow with a solo break after playing possum in the final thirty miles as they fended off attacks from Shane Vasquez and Chris Harkey, a former winner.\nBut in 2012, Giovanni Choto would end the Belizean run of futility as he stood up for 134 miles, 75 of them alone, staying out in front all day and earning himself a place in the annals of history.\nOne year later, it was a cat-and-mouse finish as no one group was able to dominate the field as in previous years. It ended with a sprint at the tape won by Darnell Barrow.\nThe 2014 race saw a return to foreign domination, as a pack of six foreigners including returning second-place winner Magallanes dumped the Belizean field and rode to the tape, where Magallanes edged out Padilla Miranda and Florencio Ramos.\nCross Country Classic Winners 1990–present\nJunior, Female and other classics.\nAs the popularity of the Cross Country classic became apparent, the local Association hastened to broaden its appeal. The Junior and Female versions of the event began in the 1990s and rode on the same day as the big race, though over a shorter distance and finishing earlier. The early years of the female Classic were dominated by Camille Solis, who won six titles, the most for any Classic participant, male or female. She retired in 1999 and female cycling stalled until its revival with a new core of cyclists. The current female champion after the conclusion of the 2014 race is Belize's Shalini Zabaneh and Ernest Bradley (2015) is the current Junior Male Champion. The female Classic, part of a list of annual events, now runs in May on Mother's Day, while the junior Classic runs within a few weeks of the big one. More recent additions include special races for Masters' and Non-elite (unregistered) cyclists.\nWhen the female versions of the event began in the 1990s, the females covered a much greater distance of the race than is currently covered today. The female's version began at approximately the same time (5am), and saw the females travelling from mile 25 on the Western Highway to San Ignacio, and making the return journey. As the first few years went by, the males would catch the women at a closer distance to Belize City each year they rode. While the males would always finish first, there was no short of excitement when the female contenders would enter the stadium as the crowd erupted with cheer. While Solis would often emerge victorious, she faced a number of solid contenders from both Belize and the United States. Due to Solis' efforts female cycling in Belize is slowly gaining broader appeal and most Elite teams now have at least one female rider on the roster."

        "text": "James Oscar Butler, Jr. (born September 7, 1982) is a former American football safety who played in the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2005. He played college football at Georgia Tech. Butler earned a Super Bowl ring with the Giants in Super Bowl XLII.\nEarly years.\nButler was a four-year letterman at Bainbridge High School in Bainbridge, Georgia, where he was the state champion in the triple jump as a sophomore. He was Class 5A honorable mention All-State selection as well as First-team All-Region and All-South Georgia. He had 69 tackles and two interceptions as a senior, following 54 tackles and four interceptions as a junior.\nCollege career.\nButler was an American football free safety at Georgia Tech from 2001 to 2004. He was undrafted despite his highly decorated collegiate career. While at Georgia Tech, he majored in Building Construction. Butler, in four years, totaled 204 tackles, seven interceptions, ten pass breakups, four forced fumbles and blocked two field goals in his final two years as a starter at Georgia Tech, recorded 240 tackles in his career with the Yellow Jackets, was a semifinalist for the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's top defensive back as a senior in 2004, when he was named First-team All-ACC for the second straight season, was second on the team with 85 tackles along with two interceptions, four pass breakups, a forced fumble and a blocked field goal, was also named to the ACC All-Academic team for the second straight year. The most notable performance of Butler's career was in 2004 when Georgia Tech's defense held Maryland to only 81 yards of total offense.\nButler was inducted into the Georgia Tech Sports Hall of Fame on October 11, 2014.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nButler saw action in 16 games during his rookie season in which he accumulated one start, plus the NFC Wild Card Game, tied for second on the team with 21 special teams tackles (19 solo). He recorded 18 tackles (14 solo), two interceptions, five passes defensed and one fumble recovery in play in dime packages. In 2006, Butler played in 14 regular season games with most of his action coming on special teams but he did see action in dime packages on defense and finished the season with 11 tackles (9 solo), 4 passes defensed and 12 special teams tackles. In Butler's third season (2007), the Giants defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Butler led the Giants with ten total tackles in the game. In all Butler played in 13 regular season games with 12 starts and started all 4 postseason games at strong safety and finished with 69 tackles (38 solo), 1 interception, 6 passes defensed, and 1 fumble recovery. Butler, played in 15 games with a career-high 14 starts in 2008 and he had 76 tackles (45 solo) and three interceptions and six passes defensed.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nAn unrestricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Butler agreed to terms on a four-year $14 million contract, which could be worth almost $17 million if all incentives are met, with the St. Louis Rams on March 9. Butler who was good all-around safety for the Giants was particularly noted for his run support, \"Butler is far stronger against the run than the pass and will be used as an \"in the box\" safety\" for the Rams. The move reunited him with former Giants defensive coordinator and now former head coach of the Rams, Steve Spagnuolo.\nPersonal life.\nHe currently resides in Roswell, Georgia with his wife and children.\nAfter the end of his NFL career, he finished the needed course requirements to receive a bachelor's degree in Building Construction from Georgia Tech on May 2, 2015.\nButler was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of health care fraud by the United States Department of Justice on December 12, 2019. He initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but changed his plea to guilty by July 2020. In October 2021, Butler was sentenced to two months in federal prison and 180 days of house arrest."

        "title": "1938 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1938 Tour de France was the 32nd edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 5 to 31 July. It was composed of 21 stages over .The race was won by Italian cyclist Gino Bartali, who also won the mountains classification.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe bonification system was reduced compared to 1937: the winner of a stage now only received one minute bonification time, added by the margin to the second arriving cyclist, with a maximum of 75 seconds. The cyclists who reached a mountain top that counted towards the mountains classification first, now received only one minute bonification time.\nThe team trial stages, where the teams departed 15 minutes separately, were removed from the race. They would later return in the 1954 Tour de France, in a different form. Instead, the 1938 Tour de France featured two individual time trials.\nIn previous years, some cyclists were in teams and other rode individually. In 1937, there had been problems with individual cyclists being accused of helping other cyclists, culminating in the Belgian cyclists leaving the Tour. To avoid these problems, the categories for individual cyclists were removed for the 1938 Tour de France, and the race was contested by national teams. But because there were many French cyclists that did not fit into the national team, there were two extra French teams, the Bleuets and Cadets. The Bleuets was a kind of French \"B\"-team, while the Cadets consisted of young French promises.\nTeams.\nThe big cycling nations in 1938, Belgium, Italy, Germany and France, each sent a team of 12 cyclists. Other countries, Spain, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Netherlands, sent smaller teams of six cyclists each. The French had two extra teams of 12 cyclists, the Cadets and Bleuets.\nThe three most powerful teams were the Belgian, the French and the Italian national team. The Italian team was led by Bartali, who had been close to winning the Tour de France in 1937 until he crashed. The Italian cycling federation had requested him to skip the 1938 Giro d'Italia so he could focus on the Tour de France.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 15.\nRace overview.\nBefore the Pyrenees, all the favourites remained calm. André Leducq did not lose much time in the first stages, and when he got in a breakaway in the second part of the sixth stage, he took over the lead from Jean Majerus. In the eighth stage, Gino Bartali attacked, and dropped everybody. On the descent of the Col d'Aspin, his wheel collapsed, and Félicien Vervaecke and Ward Vissers overtook him. Bartali came back to finish in third place, but Vervaecke took the lead in the general classification. In that stage, former winner Georges Speicher was caught holding on to a car, and was removed from the race.\nAfter that stage, Bartali was in second place in the general classification. He won some time on Vervaecke because of bonifications for reaching the tops of the Portet d'Aspet and the Braus first and winning the 11th stage, but lost some time in the individual time trial in stage 10b.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Bartali attacked again, and gained 17 minutes on Vervaecke and 20 on Vissers. Bartali was now leader of the race.\nBefore the next stage, Bartali felt poorly. His team director, Costante Girardengo, told him not to force himself. Bartali let the others get away on the first mountains, but during the descent of the Iseran, Bartali went as fast as he could, and reach his concurrents. During that stage, Mathias Clemens, who started the stage in second place, lost a lot of time, so Vervaecke was back in second place, 20 minutes behind Bartali.\nIn the rest of the race, Bartali defended his lead with ease. Vervaecke won back some time in the last individual time trial, but that was not enough to endanger Bartali's lead.\nIn the last stage, Antonin Magne (winner of the Tour de France in 1931 and 1934) and André Leducq (winner of the Tour de France in 1930 and 1932) escaped together, and crossed the finish line together. The Tour jury declared them both winner. This was Leducq's 25th and final stage victory. For both cyclists it was also the last stage they ever rode in the Tour de France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nFor the mountains classification, 12 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation. The Iseran was included for the first time in 1938. On the top of these mountains, ten points were given for the first cyclist to pass, nine points to the second cyclist, and so on, until the tenth cyclist who got one point. The mountains classification in 1938 was won by Gino Bartali. Bartali was the first cyclist to win the general classification and the mountains classification of the Tour de France in the same year.\nThe team classification was calculated in 1938 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. In 1938, there were eight teams of twelve cyclists. Belgium, Italy, Germany and France had a team, Luxembourg and Switzerland both supplied six cyclists for a combined team, as did Spain and the Netherlands, and there were two extra French teams, the \"bleuets\" and the \"cadets\". The bleuets were also described as \"France B\", and the cadets as \"France C\".\nAftermath.\nBecause of the political tensions in Europe before the Second World War, Italy did not send a team to the 1939 Tour de France, so Bartali was unable to defend his title. After the war, the Tour de France resumed in 1947. In 1948, Bartali won his second Tour, becoming the first and so far only cyclist to win editions of the Tour de France ten years apart."

        "text": "Albert King (born December 17, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player. The younger brother of former NBA scoring champion, Hall of Famer Bernard King, Albert played at Fort Hamilton High School in Brooklyn and is regarded as one of the nation's greatest high school players of all time. He was rated the top prep player in the nation over Magic Johnson and Gene Banks during his senior year. A guard-forward from the University of Maryland, King was selected by the New Jersey Nets in the first round (10th overall) of the 1981 NBA draft. King played in nine NBA seasons for four teams.\nEarly life.\nKing attended Fort Hamilton High School in Brooklyn, New York. He was named to the inaugural McDonald's All-American team, which played in the 1977 Capital Classic.\nCollege career.\nIn the 1979–80 college season, King was named the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" twice during the 1980 season. One of the highlights of his ACC career was a thundering dunk over Duke center Mike Gminski during a Maryland home game at Cole Field House. Duke was the first-seeded team in the nation at the time, and King went on to lead the Terrapins in scoring that night and helped defeat the Blue Devils 101–82. His no. 55 jersey was honored by the Maryland basketball program. In 2002, King was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team as one of the fifty greatest players in Atlantic Coast Conference history.\nProfessional career.\nKing played in nine NBA seasons for four teams. He played for the New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, San Antonio Spurs and Washington Bullets. King's best years as a professional came during his playing days with the Nets from 1981 to 1987. During the 1982–83 season, he appeared in 79 games and averaged 17.0 points per game and 3.7 assists per game. In his NBA career, he played in 534 games and scored a total of 6,470 points.\nAt the end of the 1988–89 season, he was signed by Olimpia Milano of the Italian Basketball League to replace Billy Martin. In Milan he played the last two games of the regular season and the following 12 of the postseason.

        "text": "The International Boxing Club of New York was a corporation formed by James D. Norris and Arthur M. Wirtz in 1949 to promote boxing bouts at Madison Square Garden, Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium, St. Nicholas Arena, Chicago Stadium and Detroit Olympia.\nMonopoly.\nIn 1949 Madison Square Garden paid Mike Jacobs of Twentieth Century Boxing Club $100,000 to relinquish his rights to promote fights at the Garden. Jacobs had become ill as a result of a stroke and the Garden wanted to turn over promotion to the IBC. The IBC had obtained the contracts of four contenders from Joe Louis for $160,000 on his retirement, and wanted to promote the fight in the Garden.\nThe IBC developed a stranglehold on championship boxing, promoting 47 out of 51 championship bouts in the United States from 1949 to 1955. Its major revenues were acquired through television of twice-weekly boxing bouts from the Garden.\nNorris and Wirtz formed the International Boxing Club of Illinois to discourage the perception that the IBC monopolized boxing. Norris resigned as president of IBC of New York in favor of Truman Gibson and the IBC was bought by the Garden and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary. But Judge Sylvester Ryan of the U.S. District Court decided the IBC of New York was a monopoly and ordered its dissolution. Norris and Wirtz were given five years to divest themselves of their holdings (approximately 40%) in the Garden. Ryan also declared the IBC of Illinois a monopoly and ordered its dissolution as well. The decisions were appealed but confirmed on January 12, 1959 by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nIn a surprise move, on January 30, 1959 Norris and Wirtz announced they were selling their interest in the Garden to Graham-Paige Corporation, a New York investment company. The sale became official on February 19, 1959.\nTies to the Mafia.\nIn 1960, the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver held hearings into organized crime and professional boxing. It was revealed that the IBC had ties to Mafioso Frankie Carbo, a soldier in New York's Lucchese Family who had been a gunman with Murder, Inc. At the time of the hearings, Carbo was imprisoned on Riker's Island, having been convicted of the undercover management of prizefighters and unlicensed matchmaking. The hearings revealed that Carbo's wife was employed by the IBC at a salary of $45,000 a year.\nFormer world welterweight and middleweight champion Carmen Basilio testified before the Subcommittee, giving evidence on Carbo, Carbo's partner Frank \"Blinky\" Palermo (a member of the St. Louis crime family, and Carbo's aide, Gabriel Genovese, a cousin of Mafia Don Vito Genovese who was convicted in 1959 of being an unlicensed boxing manager. Calling for a house cleaning of professional boxing, Basilio's testimony revealed that his former managers had to pay off organized crime for his title shots and that he essentially had a behind the scenes manager in Genovese. He also told of meeting with Carbo, who he had first met in the mid-1950s. \nEvidence submitted to the subcommittee showed that Basilio's on-the-record managers, John DeJohn and Joseph Netro, paid Gabriel Genovese $39,334.41 and approximately $25,000, respectively, during the time Basilio fought for and defended his welterweight and middleweight titles. \nThe following year, Gibson Jr. and Carbo, Carbo's partner \"Blinky\" Palermo, and Los Angeles mobsters Joe Di Sica and Louis Dragna, were charged with conspiracy and extortion against National Boxing Association Welterweight Champion Don Jordan. After a three-month trial, in which U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy served as prosecutor, the defendants were convicted and sent to federal prison."

He had officiated Super Bowls XXXVI in 2002, XXXVIII in 2004, and was the referee for XLIV in 2010. Green was also the head of the NFL Referees Association and led negotiations during the 2012 NFL referee lockout.\nOutside his part-time work in professional football, Green works as a Washington, D.C. contractor for public safety and criminal justice agencies as part of a firm he co-founded in 1994. Green announced his retirement at the conclusion of the 2013 football season.\nBackground.\nGreen is a 1969 graduate of Central Bucks High School in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, where he was a linebacker and kicker. He is a 1973 graduate of the University of Delaware, where he received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. Prior to his NFL career, from 1985 to 1990 Green was a Judiciary Committee staff person under then-Senator Joe Biden. In 1994, Green, a resident of Potomac Falls, Virginia, co-founded the Lafayette Group with Charles B. DeWitt, a Washington, D.C., government contractor that focuses on public safety and emergency management; as of 2014 the firm employs 90 people.\nOfficiating career.\nGreen started in the NFL as a field judge with the start of the 1991 NFL season before switching to back judge after the league swapped position titles at the start of the 1998 NFL season. Green worked Super Bowl XXXVI on February 3, 2002, as a back judge, Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1, 2004, also as a back judge, and Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010, as referee. His last assignment was the Pro Bowl on January 26, 2014, in Honolulu as referee.\nGreen wore uniform number 19, now worn by Clay Martin.\nBack judge.\nGreen was considered by some to be the top back judge in the league. He was however involved in a situation described by commissioner Paul Tagliabue as the most disappointing officiating blunder he'd seen in his years as NFL commissioner. During a New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers in January 2003. Green did not realize that New York's Rich Seubert had lined up legally in a receiver's spot and failed to award a penalty when he was interfered with following an attempted field goal, instead penalizing him. It was later announced that officiating mechanics surrounding field-goal attempts and last plays of games would be changed.\nPromotion to referee.\nHe became a referee on a part-time basis during the 2004 NFL season when referee Johnny Grier was injured. Green became a full-time referee at the start of the 2005 NFL season after Grier was forced to retire due to a leg injury. Green's first experience as an NFL referee came on October 3, 2004, during a game between the New England Patriots and the Buffalo Bills.\nGreen's 2013 NFL officiating crew consisted of umpire Bruce Stritesky, head linesman Tom Stabile, line judge Mike Spanier, field judge Boris Cheek, side judge Larry Rose, and back judge Scott Helverson.\nDuring an NFL game he was officiating between the Pittsburgh Steelers and San Diego Chargers in 2008, Green ruled a lateral play by the Steelers as illegal, a decision he later conceded was wrong. The incident has prompted the NFL to discuss \"potential administrative improvements for replay that would help to prevent this type of mistake in the future.\""

        "title": "Murray Cook (baseball)",
        "text": "George Earl Murray Cook (born December 6, 1940) is a Canadian scout and former front office executive in Major League Baseball. He was the general manager of three MLB teams: the New York Yankees (1981–84); the Montreal Expos (1984–87); and the Cincinnati Reds (1988–1990).\nPirates and Yankees.\nCook began his baseball career as an infielder in the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system in 1962. He then became a scout and farm system administrator, serving Pittsburgh as assistant director of Minor League operations (1972–77), then director of scouting (1977–79). He was named the Yankees' scouting director in January 1980.\nYankees.\nCook was promoted to general manager of the New York Yankees on June 30, 1981 after Bill Bergesch was hired by Bob Howsam to be GM of the Cincinnati Reds. With manager Billy Martin at the helm the whole1983 season, the team showed a marked improvement, posting a 91-71 record, good for third place. However, George Steinbrenner fired Martin for the third time after the season, and brought in Yogi Berra as the new manager for 1984. Cook had little say in these matters. Murray Cook earned Steinbrenner's wrath when the Oakland Athletics selected pitcher Tim Belcher from the Yankees in the free agent compensation draft on February 8, 1984. Belcher had been the first player selected in the 1983 amateur draft but had refused to sign with the Minnesota Twins at the time; the Yankees had scored a coup by selecting him in the secondary phase of the January 1984 amateur draft and signing him to a contract a few days later. However, they had already submitted their list of protected players for the free agent draft and were unable to add the newly signed Belcher, leading to his selection by the Athletics. A furious Steinbrenner reduced Cook's responsibilities, leaving a void in the front office until he named Clyde King as his replacement on April 9. Cook inherited the title of vice-president and director of scouting in the shuffle, as Steinbrenner stated that \"I take the blame of asking a young man to move too fast too soon\". He stayed in that role for a few months until he submitted his resignation on August 20, 1984, explaining that he wanted to have a decision-making role again.\nExpos.\nOn August 30, the Montreal Expos fired manager Bill Virdon, followed five days later by general manager John McHale. Cook was hired on September 5. His first action after taking over was to hire Buck Rodgers, who had just won the Minor League Manager of the Year Award by leading the Expos' AAA farm team, the Indianapolis Indians to a 91-63 record and the American Association championship.\nDue to a tight budget set by the Expos ownership, Cook had to rely on trades instead of signing free agents. He traded away Gary Carter, Bill Gullickson, and Jeff Reardon in order to acquire promising minor league talent. He became known for picking up prospects that other teams were willing to discard, such as Dennis Martínez and Pascual Pérez. He also used the Rule 5 draft to acquire Jeff Parrett.\nScandal.\nOn August 11, 1987, the Expos called a hasty press conference to announce Cook had been fired and Vice-President for Baseball Administration Bill Stoneman was taking over as general manager. Over the next few weeks, rumours began circulating that the firing was not for baseball reasons. In fact, Cook had been dismissed for having an affair with Pamela Brochu, wife of Expos President and CEO Claude Brochu. Cook broke up with his wife of many years to marry his former boss's wife.\nReds.\nAt the start of the 1988 season, Cook was hired to replace Bill Bergesch, the same man he had replaced in New York, as GM of the Cincinnati Reds. They finished second in 1988 and won three more games than the previous season. However, in 1989 the Reds fell to fifth due to the turmoil surrounding manager Pete Rose being banned from baseball. Cook was replaced by Bob Quinn after the season. The year after Cook was let go, the Reds won the World Series.\nLater career.\nFrom 2002 through 2006, Cook was a major league scout for the Boston Red Sox, joining Boston after nearly a decade as a scout for the Florida Marlins. Since the season, he has been the East Coast regional crosschecker for the Detroit Tigers. \nOn Saturday June 21, 2014, Cook was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, in St. Marys, Ontario, along with former Montreal Expos announcer Dave Van Horne and their popular long time slugging outfielder Tim Wallach."

        "title": "Rugby union in Kenya",
        "text": "Rugby union in Kenya is a popular sport, in particular due to the success of the Kenya national rugby sevens team in the rugby sevens format, and tournaments such as the Safari Sevens, which has been growing yearly, and now includes numerous international teams.\nGoverning body.\nThe sport is governed by the Kenya Rugby Union.\nThe Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K) was formed in 1923. RFU-K was then incorporated into the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) in 1956. Kenya deaf Rugby Football Union was formed in 1970 to govern the game in Kenya.\nAt the 2019 Kenyan Sports Personality of the Year awards KDRFU won the federation of the year category.\nHistory.\nRugby has a long history in Kenya.\nThe first recorded game in Kenya took place in 1909, when a team composed of predominantly British \"Officials\" took on mainly Afrikaaner \"Settlers\" in Mombasa.\nThe Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K) was formed in 1923, the same year when Nairobi District team split to form Harlequins RFC (which is not the current club Kenya Harlequins which was formed in 1952) and Nondescripts RFC. Impala RFC, another traditional club was founded in the 1930s. For a number of years, the Nondescripts and the Harlequins were two of the best sides in the country and dominated Kenyan rugby.\nWhen the British Isles went to South Africa for their 1955 tour and their 1962 tour, they played East Africa sides in Nairobi, on the return leg of their journey. The Lions won both of these games, 39-12 and 50-0 respectively.\nThe East Africa team played some of the best sides in the world, including the British Lions in 1955, South Africa in 1961, and Wales in 1964.\nThe political struggle in Kenya took a heavy toll on rugby. Not only had the white population failed to promote the game properly amongst the black African and Asian population in Kenya, but when employment restrictions were introduced by the newly independent Kenyan state, they ensured that a number of the white British and South Africans who had been the mainstay of the game previously left the country.\nThe large distances involved would frequently cause big communication problems for Kenyan teams. For example, in 1974, when Nairobi was due to play Mombasa, the Mombasa team flew to Nairobi, while the Nairobi team drove to Mombasa. It was a 950-mile round trip, meaning that the two teams covered nearly 2,000 miles in a game that didn't happen.\nUntil the mid-1970s the sport in Kenya was mainly played by expatriates. This changed once new \"black\" clubs, Mean Machine RFC and Mwamba RFC were formed. Today, rugby in Kenya is played almost exclusively by indigenous players. Rugby in Kenya is mostly played in Nairobi, only a handful of teams come from outside the capital.\nThe struggle to make Kenyan rugby truly multiracial, and to make it popular was tackled frantically by the KRFU in the post-independence period, with success only coming under its president George Kariuki in the 1980s and 1990s. The former Gloucester player Dave Protherough helped out the KRFU, before his death in the mid-1990s, and helped the game to thrive once more.\nKenya is a founder member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR), which was launched officially in January 1986, in Tunis. Rugby officials from Morocco, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, the Seychelles and Madagascar also attended.\nKenya plays host to the annual Bamburi Rugby Super Series which teams from other East African countries also attend. In 2009, it also hosted the IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy, the second tier of the under-20 world championship structure established in 2008 by the sport's governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB).\nSafari Sevens is an international Rugby sevens tournament played annually in Nairobi and is the most popular rugby competition in Kenya.\nNational team.\nKenya dominated the local 'international' rugby scene but when combined with Tanzania and Uganda they formed the East Africa rugby union team. This consisted mostly of white settlers from Kenya, and the games tended to be hosted in Nairobi. Nicknamed The Tuskers, a name which was taken from a local beer, the first overseas touring East Africa XV played in the Copperbelt of what was then Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, in September 1954 when they won six out of seven matches.\nThe British Isles played games against an East African side, on their 1955 tour, and 1962 tours (losing 50–0).\nThe national team played its first international in 1955, and is yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup. However, the country's sevens team has had far more international success.\nKenya was ranked 39th in the world by the IRB as of 6 April 2009. However, in 2010, Kenya rose in the ranking to 32nd in the world and later ranked 31st in 2013 after beating Zimbabwe 29–17 in a tournament that doubled up as the qualifying stage for the 2015 World Cup..As of the 31st of October 2022, the team was ranked number 33 by World Rugby.\nAs of 2023 Kenya is ranked 31st by World Rugby and has been playing impressively well. This is evident in their results in the African Rugby Cup as Kenya have been the runners-up of the past four years in a row losing to Namibia. As well as this they also finished second in the 2023 Rugby World Cup African Qualification tournament which qualified them for the repechage cup.\nSevens team.\nThe national sevens team are currently one of the 12 \"core teams\" in the IRB Sevens World Series, advancing at least to the semi-finals of three events in the 2008–09 season, and also reached the semi-finals of the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nThey also managed to win the 2016 IRB Sevens World Series cup in Dubai.\nDomestic structure.\nThe popularity of Kenyan rugby has greatly increased over the last few years and the country now has over 40 clubs, 40,000 players, of whom nearly 30,000 are teenagers and 3000 are women.\nSchool rugby.\nThe KRFU also oversees Kenyan schools rugby, including the Prescott Cup for the most elite teams, and the Damu Pevu shield for the second level of teams (and second XV). In 1990, Rugby 15s was admitted as formal sport in secondary schools around the country and in 2008 it was admitted as a primary school sport. Rugby Sevens was admitted as a formal sport in secondary schools in 2004.\nA major part of competition at the junior level is the St Mary's Blackrock Festival which has been used to scout for Kenya's top players for the last 26 years. Biko Adema, a current Kenya sevens player, was once the most valuable player in the tournament.\nClub rugby.\nThe Kenya Cup is the highest level rugby union league in Kenya and is yet to turn professional.

        "text": "John Dwight Smith Sr. (November 8, 1963 – July 22, 2022) was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for four teams from 1989 to 1996, primarily the Chicago Cubs.\nAs a rookie with the Cubs, he batted .324 with 52 runs batted in (RBI) as the team captured a division title, and he was runner-up behind teammate Jerome Walton in voting for the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award. He was increasingly used as a pinch hitter in his five seasons with the team. After a season split between two American League (AL) clubs, he played two final seasons with the Atlanta Braves, helping them win the 1995 World Series title. His son, Dwight Smith Jr., is a former major league outfielder who most recently played in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nSmith was born in Tallahassee, Florida. He was the youngest of four children. His father died when he was seven years old.\nSmith attended Wade Hampton High School in Varnville, South Carolina, and played for the school's baseball and football teams. He enrolled at Spartanburg Methodist College in 1983. Playing college baseball for Spartanburg, Smith competed in the Junior College World Series.\nProfessional career.\nChicago Cubs (1984–1993).\nThe Chicago Cubs selected Smith in the third round of the 1984 MLB draft. He made his professional debut with the Pikeville Cubs of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, struggling to a .236 batting average, but his 39 stolen bases were the most in the league. He batted .289 with 30 stolen bases for the Geneva Cubs of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League in 1985 and .310 with 53 stolen bases for the Peoria Chiefs of the Class A Midwest League in 1986. Smith played for the Pittsfield Cubs of the Class AA Eastern League in 1987, batting .337 with 18 home runs, and leading the league with 60 stolen bases and 111 runs scored. He was promoted to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA American Association in 1988. Though he batted .293 for Iowa, he returned there for the start of the 1989 season because the Cubs felt that he needed to improve his defense.\nAfter batting .325 in 21 games for Iowa, the Cubs promoted Smith to the major leagues due to injuries on the major league team. He made his debut with the Cubs on May 1, and batted .324 as a rookie, with nine home runs and 52 runs batted in. Smith finished second in balloting for the NL Rookie of the Year Award behind teammate Jerome Walton, who collected 22 of 24 first-place votes; Smith received the other two. Smith batted 3-for-15 (.200) for the Cubs in the NL Championship Series (NLCS), which they lost to the San Francisco Giants.\nSmith struggled in the 1990 season and lost his starting job. He batted .262 for the 1990 season, and the Cubs signed George Bell to play in the outfield. Smith was again a bench player with the Cubs in the 1991 season. He batted .228 in 167 at bats in 1991. Smith began the 1992 season in a platoon with Sammy Sosa playing in left field, but was demoted to the minor leagues from late April to late May after starting the season batting .217. Smith finished the season with a .276 average, three home runs, and 24 RBIs, and signed a one-year contract worth $630,000 for the 1993 season. In 1993, Smith had a .300 batting average and a career-best 11 home runs. Under pressure to reduce their salary obligations, the Cubs did not offer Smith salary arbitration after the 1993 season, making him a free agent.\nLater career (1994–1998).\nThe California Angels signed Smith to a one-year contract for the 1994 season, worth a reported $700,000. He began the 1994 season in a platoon with Bo Jackson, but became a bench player on June 1 when the Angels began to play Jim Edmonds on a daily basis. Smith requested a trade, and the Angels traded Smith to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named later on June 15. For California and Baltimore, Smith batted .281 with eight home runs and 30 RBIs in 73 games.\nSmith signed a one-year contract worth $250,000 with the Atlanta Braves for the 1995 season, agreeing to be a bench player. He batted .252 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 103 games during the 1995 season. In the postseason, Smith appeared as a pinch hitter, batting 2-for-3 in the Division Series against the Colorado Rockies and 0-for-2 in the NL Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds. In the 1995 World Series, Smith batted 1-for-2 with a walk, as the Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in six games. Smith re-signed with the Braves for the 1996 season, agreeing to a one-year contract with a $350,000 salary. He batted .203 for the Braves during the 1996 season, and was not included on their postseason roster.\nIn 1997, no major league teams made a contract offer to Smith. He signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, an expansion team set to debut in 1998, and they assigned him to the Mexico City Tigers of the Mexican League for the 1997 season. An injury to his sciatic nerve prevented Smith from playing, and the Devil Rays released him in May. After he recuperated, Smith played for the St. Paul Saints of the Northern League, an independent baseball league, in 1997. The Devil Rays signed Smith before the 1998 season and invited him to spring training. They gave him his unconditional release before the beginning of the season. In 1998, Smith played for the Rochester Red Wings, a minor league affiliate of the Orioles.\nPersonal life.\nSmith began singing when he was four years old in his church choir. During the baseball offseasons, he sang in nightclubs and talent shows. On July 21, 1989, at Wrigley Field, Smith sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before a game against the San Francisco Giants. He also sang the national anthem on Opening Day of the 1992 season. During the 1993–94 offseason, Smith recorded a demo rhythm and blues album titled \"R U Down\".\nSmith and his wife Cheryl had one son and two daughters. His son Dwight Smith Jr. also played in the major leagues.\nSmith was arrested for driving under the influence and cannabis possession in Tyrone, Georgia, on November 22, 2003. He was arrested for cocaine possession and driving with a suspended license in Peachtree City, Georgia, on September 6, 2006.\nSmith died on July 22, 2022, of congestive heart and lung failure."

        "text": "Gary Larson (born 2 January 1967) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played as a and forward in the 1980s and 1990s.\nHe represented Australia internationally and Queensland in State of Origin, and played most of his club football with the North Sydney Bears, before finishing his career with a brief stint at the Parramatta Eels.\nBackground.\nLarson was born in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.\nCareer.\nNorth Sydney Bears.\nLarson made his first grade debut for North Sydney in his only game for the 1987 NSWRL season, a Round 9 match with Penrith at Penrith Stadium. Starting from the bench, Larson scored a try on debut but the Bears still went down to the Panthers 19–10. 1988 saw Larson playing mainly Reserve Grade for the Bears and he only played two games for the season, including his debut in the starting side playing second-row in North Sydney's 6–38 loss to league newcomers, the Newcastle Knights.\nNicknamed \"Sven Svennson\" due to his Nordic appearance, Larson cemented his place in North Sydney's first grade forward pack in 1989, playing 22 games for the season. As a player, he became known for his reliability as a \"workhorse\" due to his staggering workload in matches.\nLarson's breakout season was 1991. That year, in a team with players such as Phil Blake, David Fairleigh, Mario Fenech, Greg Florimo, Peter Jackson, Les Kiss, Billy Moore, and goal kicking sensation Daryl Halligan, his efforts were rewarded with State of Origin selection for Queensland, as well as helping Norths to the finals for the first time since 1982.\nIt would be the start of a Bears resurgence as the club with the league's longest premiership drought (not having won a title since 1922) only failing to reach the Semi-finals on three occasions (1992, 1993 and 1999) between 1991 and 1999, Larson's last season with the club. The clubs perennial bad luck still showed though as the Bears failed at the last hurdle (Preliminary Final), therefore failing to make the Grand Final, on four occasions, (1991, (1994, 1996 and 1997), falling to the eventual premiers Penrith, Canberra and Newcastle in 1991, 1994 and 1997, while losing to runners-up St George in 1996.\nLarson was sent off in the 1994 Preliminary final against the Canberra Raiders for a dangerous tackle on Raiders second-rower David Furner. According to most experts, it was this send-off which cost Larson selection on the 1994 Kangaroo Tour. Teammates Greg Florimo and 1994 Rothmans Medal winner David Fairleigh were selected to tour with the Kangaroos.\nLarson remained loyal to the Bears and the Australian Rugby League (ARL) during the Super League War. He played for Queensland in their shock 3-0 1995 State of Origin series whitewash of New South Wales, before making his test debut for Australia in the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series win over New Zealand.\nAt the end of the 1995 ARL season in which North Sydney finished in 8th place and were bundled out of the Finals in the first round by Newcastle, Larson was considered a certainty for selecting in Australia's squad for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup played in England and France. He was duly selected to the ARL only squad, but declined to tour for personal reasons. However, following an injury to Newcastle front rower Paul Harragon during an early tournament game, Kangaroo's coach Bob Fulton sent an SOS for Larson to join the squad in England. Larson answered the call and went on to play in Australia's 16–8 win over England in the World Cup Final at London's famous Wembley stadium, London.\nLarson announced his retirement from representative games in 1999, but following the merger of North Sydney and their local rivals Manly-Warringah to become the Northern Eagles, chose to see out the final season of his career with the Parramatta Eels.\nLarson played for North Sydney in their last game as a top grade side which came in against North Queensland in round 26 1999 at the Willows Sports Complex. Norths won the match 28–18.\nParramatta Eels.\nLarson joined Parramatta in 2000, in what would prove to be his final season of rugby league before retiring. He played 16 games for the Parramatta club in 2000, mostly from the bench, helping the team to 7th on the ladder, but missing their finals campaign due to injury.\nLarson played 249 first grade games for North Sydney and Parramatta over 14 seasons, scoring 34 tries (Norths – 233 games, 33 tries. Parramatta – 16 games, 1 try). In August 2006, Larson was named at prop-forward in the North Sydney Bears' \"Team of the Century\".\nRepresentative career.\nQueensland.\nLarson played his first game for Queensland in Game 1 of the 1991 State of Origin series when he was chosen at lock forward for the game at Lang Park in Brisbane. He would go on to claim the record for the most consecutive State of Origin appearances with 24 for Qld, from his first game in Game 1 of the 1991 series until his last match, Game 3 of the 1998 series. This record was equaled by Queensland's Johnathan Thurston in Game 3 of the historic 2012 series in which Qld won their record 7th series in a row.\nGary Larson was named man-of-the-match in the second game of the 1995 series and the third game of the 1997 series. Roy and HG, when commentating State of Origin matches on radio, would refer to Larson as being \"on the far side\" of the playing arena – a joke aimed at his name being shared with famous cartoonist Gary Larson (\"and the ball is passed to Gary Larson... on the far side...\").\nAustralia.\nBetween 1995 and 1997, at the height of the Super League War, Gary Larson played in 9 tests for Australia. Following the ARL's decision not to select any Super League signed player for representative duty in 1995, Larson made his belated test debut in the first test of the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand. He would play all three tests against the Kiwis, helping the Kangaroos to a 3–0 series whitewash with what many originally believed to be a 'second string' side without the SL players.\nLarson initially declared his unavailability for Australia's 1995 Rugby League World Cup team due to family commitments. However, he answered a call from coach Bob Fulton to join the team in England following a broken cheekbone suffered by Paul Harragon and, after playing in the 66-0 thrashing of Fiji where he scored his only test try, he played in both the Semi-final, against NZ, and the final against England in front of 66,540 at Wembley Stadium, London. The Australian's won their 8th World Cup with a 16–8 win.\nGary Larson would then play in two 'tests' in 1996. The first, an 84–10 win at the Marathon Stadium in Newcastle against ARL aligned players representing Fiji, and the second, a 52–6 win over an ARL-aligned Papua New Guinea at the Lloyd Robson Oval in Port Moresby.\nLarson's final match in the green and gold was in 1997 for a game against the \"Rest of the World\". With the ARL struggling to play international matches against other countries as most had signed with the Super League, a composite international side of ARL aligned players was put together for a match against Australia at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium. Putting in his usual workhorse performance, Larson helped the Kangaroos to a 28–6 win in front of just 14,927 fans, the smallest international crowd in Brisbane for 15 years.\nPersonal life.\nLarson currently lives in the coastal town of Tannum Sands in Qld with his wife Kate and his two children, Poppy and Jack. Larson is still heavily involved in the football industry. \nHe is also the brother-in-law of fellow former Norths teammate Greg Florimo."

A four-time home run king having played for Hiroshima Carp throughout his career, Yamamoto contributed to the team winning five league championships including its first-ever in 1975, and three titles of Japan Series in 1979, 1980 and 1984. He recorded over 40 home runs for five years in a row from 1977. With 536 home runs, he is fourth on the NPB career list. He is known as the , nicknamed after Hiroshima Carp's symbolic red colored helmet.\nYamamoto managed Hiroshima Carp twice, between 1989 and 1993, and later between 2001 and 2005. He led the team to win Central League championship in 1991. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008, and is a member of the Meikyukai, or the \"Golden Players Club.\"\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from high school in Hiroshima, Yamamoto was admitted to Hosei University in 1965. Although he originally joined its baseball club as a pitcher, he was later converted to outfielder by the team manager who saw higher potential in Yamamoto at bat. Thus he came to be known as the \"Hosei Trio\", together with Kōichi Tabuchi and Masaru Tomita. Yamamoto was drafted first round by Hiroshima Carp in 1968. He began to exhibit his talent as an average and long range hitter in 1975, with which he contributed to the Carp mark its first league championship in its history, ending the season at .319 (leading hitter of the year) with 30 home runs. Starting 1977, he logged over 40 home runs for five consecutive years, which is in Japan a record paralleled only by Sadaharu Oh as of 2010. He was the home run leader of 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1983 seasons, and the RBI winner between 1979 and 1981. He was also awarded the Mitsui Golden Glove Award for ten consecutive years from 1972. Together with his number 8, Yamamoto retired from playing for the Carp in 1986, when the team won the league championship but lost Japan Series for the Seibu Lions.\nManagerial career.\nSpending several years as a baseball analyst for NHK, Yamamoto returned to Hiroshima Carp as its manager in 1989. He finished the first two years in second place, then took the team to win the Central League pennant in 1991. In 1993, however, he resigned from his post after delivering the team the last place in the league which it had not seen since 1974. He was asked to direct the Carp once again in 2001, although he never finished better than fourth place in the first year, then in fifth for the following three years, and finally in last place in 2005 when he left the squadron once again."

        "text": "Darren Smith (born 8 December 1968) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. He played for the Australian national side and also Queensland in the State of Origin. His club football career was spent with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Brisbane Broncos and St. Helens. He is the brother of fellow Maroon and international, Jason Smith.\nBackground.\nBorn in Brisbane, Queensland on 8 December 1968, Darren Smith went on to play in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership. During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia, Smith was selected at 19 years of age to play for the Brisbane rugby league team against the visiting British.\nPlaying career.\n1990s.\nIn 1990 he moved from Brisbane's Easts Tigers to Sydney's Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Conspicuous in headgear after suffering a severe concussion in 1991, Smith made his State of Origin début as a reserve for Queensland in the 1992 series. During the 1993 State of Origin series Smith played from the interchange bench n Games 2 and 3, both losses.\nSmith was selected to play on the interchange bench in all three games of the 1994 State of Origin series which was eventually lost by Queensland. He looked certain to press for Australian selection until off-field politics took its toll in the 1994 NSWRL season. Smith's refusal to renew his contract with Canterbury, negotiating with two Brisbane clubs instead, saw him used in the limited role of interchange player. Smith's place in Canterbury's grand final side was taken by youngster Steven Hughes who made little impact when brought on to the field as a replacement. Smith revealed that he had signed with the South Queensland Crushers but he then did an about-face and successfully sought a release to play with the Brisbane Broncos in 1995.\nIt was unfortunate that Smith hit possibly his best form at a time when the code was in turmoil, and he did not represent again until 1997's Super League season. He proved his durability at the highest level, making his Test début against New Zealand and playing at lock forward in the 1997 Anzac Test, the first Anzac Test, as well as all five Tests against the New Zealand and Great Britain as well as making three appearances in Queensland's Tri-Series side.\nWhen the game reunified for the 1998 NRL season, Smith returned to the Queensland State of Origin team and was the National Rugby League's top try-scorer for the season, crossing for the final try in Brisbane's 38–12 thrashing of his former club Canterbury in the 1998 NRL grand final. In an ironic twist to his career, Smith announced that he was returning to the Bulldogs in 1999.\nSmith was selected for the Australian team to play in the 1999 ANZAC Test, and to compete in the end of season 1999 Tri Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at centre in the Kangaroos' 22–20 victory.\n2000s.\nIn 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Smith left the Bulldogs at the end of 2002 (denied the opportunity to finally win a premiership with the club when it was stripped of its competition points) to play with English club St. Helens. Having won Super League VI, St Helens contested the 2003 World Club Challenge against 2002 NRL Premiers, the Sydney Roosters. Smith played at second-row forward in Saints' 38–0 loss. At the end of his first English season Smith was unexpectedly called into the Third Test of the Ashes series (despite being 34 years old and outside the NRL) by his former Bulldogs coach, national coach Chris Anderson, who felt the available 2003 Kangaroo s were not experienced enough.\nRetirement.\nSmith returned to Australia in 2004 and made cameo appearances with the Broncos in two matches while playing for his former club, Eastern Suburbs Tigers. At age 36 years and 284 days, he was the NRL's oldest player in 2005. Smith finally retired as a player after Easts were beaten in the grand final. At the time of his retirement Smith held the record for most tries in a season for the Broncos (together with Steve Renouf) at 23."

He played for the Washington Capitals and Winnipeg Jets between 1974 and 1980. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1974 to 1984, was spent in the minor leagues.\nEarly life.\nRiley's mother worked as a cleaning lady, while his father earned the minimum wage of $1.25 per hour. With limited finances, they made the necessary sacrifices to outfit their son with the required equipment to play hockey starting in peewee. Riley stuck with the game in spite of the absence of many black role models in the sport. After two seasons with the Amherst Ramblers, a team he would go on to coach many years later, he held no aspirations of pursuing hockey as a big-league career.\nIn 1973 while working in a factory and playing senior hockey with the Kitimat Eagles senior team in the Pacific Northwest Hockey League in British Columbia, Riley was discovered after putting up 206 points in 80 games across two seasons. Future NHL coach Tom McVie was in the process of fortifying his lineup for the Dayton Gems of the International Hockey League (IHL). He discovered Riley in Kitimat and invited him for a tryout. Riley accepted and made the club in 1974.\nCareer.\nRiley was given a tryout with the Washington Capitals during their inaugural season in 1974-75 and played in one game, but he spent most of his time in the minors, primarily with the Dayton Gems. It was during this time that he was reunited with and played under future Capitals' coach McVie. He would eventually be signed as a free agent by the Capitals during the 1976–77 NHL season and played for the Capitals in parts of the next three seasons.\nRiley was claimed by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1979 NHL Expansion Draft, but only played in 14 games before he was sent to the minors, where he played, with the New Brunswick Hawks, Moncton Alpines and the Nova Scotia Voyageurs, until he retired following the 1983–84 season.\nRiley was player-coach and captain of the St. John's Capitals of the Newfoundland Senior Hockey League for three seasons during the late 1980s.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from professional play, Riley returned to coaching in 1989-90, when he landed a head coaching position with the Amherst Ramblers of the Maritime Junior A Hockey League. Later, he was the head coach, general manager and director of player personnel of the Miramichi Timberwolves of the Maritime Junior A Hockey League. He also served as head coach of the Moncton Wildcats during the 1996–97 season, finishing with a 16–52–2 record.\nPersonal life.\nRiley was roommates with Dave Feamster, and together they once poached a deer, to provide meat for Riley and his family.\nRiley's son, Billy Jr., was killed in a motor vehicle accident in 2011 in Moncton at age 35.\nIn 2017, after seeing a segment on Hockey Night in Canada about Toronto Maple Leafs legend Bill Barilko, Riley sent his daughter Tracey, who lived in Timmins, to the site of Barilko's grave to clean his tombstone.\nAwards and honours.\n• Calder Cup (As a player) - 1982\n• Callaghan Cup (As a coach) - 1990\n• Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame - 1998\n• Number 8 jersey retired by Amherst Ramblers - 2013"

        "title": "1922 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1922 Tour de France was the 16th edition of the Tour de France and was held from 25 June to 23 July. The 1922 Tour consisted of 15 stages covering a total of . The Tour de France was won by the Belgian cyclist Firmin Lambot, who had also won the 1919 Tour de France.\nThe first part of the race showcased the tactics of Robert Jacquinot and some action from Eugène Christophe. During the Pyrenees stages, the climber Jean Alavoine became the leader after three consecutive stage wins: Bayonne, Luchon, and Perpignan. Lambot was 48 minutes behind Christophe at one point but then plowed ahead to his win in Paris.\nAlavoine's success appeared to be written in stone as they raced through the southern part of the race. This was especially true when he increased his lead to more than 22 minutes in Briançon.\nOn the stage to Geneva the frigid weather and several mechanical issues bore down on Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second for the last two years). It appeared that this was going to be his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque. Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first man to win the Tour de France without winning any stage.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn the 1921 Tour de France, the Belgians had again been dominating, which the French audience did not like. Tour organiser Henri Desgrange did not like the cooperation between cyclists, because he wanted the Tour de France to be a display of individual strength. He had sworn to change the format for the 1922 Tour de France, but this did not happen, and the formula remained the same.\nAlthough World War I was already a few years ago, its economic impact was not yet over. The cycling companies were still not able to sponsor the cyclists in the way they did before the war, so as in 1919, 1920 and 1921 they bundled their forces under the nick La Sportive. The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named \"1ère classe\" (first class), the professionals, and \"2ème classe\" (second class), the amateurs.\nThe French cyclists Henri and Francis Pélissier had stopped the 1920 Tour de France after Henri received a penalty from the Tour organisation for throwing away a tire. For this reason, the Pélissier brothers did not start in the 1921 and 1922 Tours.\nRace overview.\nIn the start of the race, Robert Jacquinot made the race. The third stage ended in the vélodrome of Brest. The first 24 cyclists held an elimination race, which was won by Jacquinot.\nIn the fourth stage, Jacquinot punctured three times, and lost a lot of time. Eugène Christophe took over the lead. On the sixth stage, the Tourmalet was scheduled to be climbed. Due to heavy snow, the route was changed to avoid the Tourmalet. Christophe still led the race after that stage, 37 years and 164 days old; this makes him the oldest person in Tour de France history to lead the general classification. During this sixth stage, Philippe Thys, who was in second position in the overall classification, broke his wheel and lost more than three hours, which removed his chances to win the Tour de France for the fourth time. Also in that stage, a shepherd suggested to Emile Masson to take a shortcut on a goat track. Masson took the shortcut, had to carry his bike, and even lost time.\nAfter three consecutive stage victories, Jean Alavoine took over the lead. Alavoine secured his lead during the stages in Southern France, and extended the lead to 22 minutes in the tenth stage.\nDuring the 11th stage, Honoré Barthélemy (3rd place in 1921) fell many times, and had to abandon the race. Climbing the Galibier, Eugène Christophe broke the fork of his bicycle. This was the third time in his career that this happened. He walked to the top, and down the entire descent before he could fix it. He finished the stage three hours after the winner. The leader of the race, Alavoine, also suffered from mechanical problems. His chain broke several times, and in the cold rain he had to put it back on. He also had a cold, and could not go along with his competitors. Heusghem attacked on that stage, and won back more than half an hour, and was then third in the general classification.\nIn the twelfth stage, Heusghem attacked Alavoine again. Alavoine punctured six times in that stage, which made it impossible for him to keep up with Heusghem. Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough to take over the lead. Heusghem was at that point the strongest rider in the race, and seemed to be on the way to the overall victory in Paris.\nIn the thirteenth stage, Hector Heusghem fell down due to a pothole, and broke his bicycle. According to the rules, he should have fixed his bicycle without help, but instead he changed to a different bicycle. He had gotten permission from a race judge to do this, but later the judges reevaluated the rules, and gave him a one-hour penalty. This dropped him to the fourth place of the general classification, and allowed Lambot to take over the lead. Lambot stayed in the yellow jersey easily until Paris, so he won the 1922 Tour de France.\nSome newspapers reported that Lambot won the race by luck, because of the penalty that was given to Heusghem. Lambot rejected this, saying that he was only eight minutes behind and that he had a good chance. To the French crowds, Jean Alavoine was the moral winner, and he was celebrated as a hero.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage. The time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nStage winners.\nPhilippe Thys won five stages, including three consecutive stage victories. Jean Alavoine also won three consecutive stage victories.\nGeneral classification.\nLambot won the overall classification, without winning any stage; this was the first time that this happened.\nOriginally, different classifications were made for the first class cyclists and the second class cyclists. Just as in 1920, French Joseph Pelletier became the winner of the second class.\nAftermath.\nThe Belgian cyclists had won eight of the fifteen stages, and placed seven cyclists in the top ten. They had now won seven Tours in a row. The French audience was still somewhat pleased by the 1922 Tour de France, as the French cyclists had won some of the stages, wore the yellow jersey for a long time during the race and Alavoine, although placed second, had competed for the victory. In the next year, the French Pélissier brothers joined the race again, and Henri Pélissier won the race. Firmin Lambot, who won the 1922 Tour, would start again two more times, but would never again win a stage or finish the Tour."

The competition focused on an overall team prize, the Platinum Trophy and Platinum team medals, but individual gold, silver and bronze medals were also awarded in each individual event.\nWhile the event is organised outside of the official World Athletics structures, at the time the IAAF expressed support for the event notwithstanding the existence of its own IAAF Continental Cup event.\nThe event was branded a failure by sports journalists, with many big-name star athletes failing to take part. The event was discontinued after its first edition.\nHistory.\nThe competition was announced on 5 February 2018 with London hosting the inaugural event. All events were held at London Stadium on 14 &amp; 15 July 2018.\nCompetition structure.\nThe competition featured just 8 nations taking part in all events over two days.

He served as the head football coach at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater from 1984 to 1994, compiling a record of 62–60–3.\nJones grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he developed an intense interest in football at an early age. In junior high he was a lineman for the Forest Heights Eagles. He played guard for the Hall High Warriors and made All-State Honorable Mention in his senior year. In college, he played linebacker and nose guard at Arkansas Tech before transferring to Arkansas. Jones' coaching stops include Arkansas, SMU, Pittsburgh, and Oklahoma State where he coached Hall of Fame running backs Thurman Thomas and 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders.\nJones served as head coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys from 1984 to 1994 after five years as an assistant under Jimmy Johnson. In 11 years at Oklahoma State, he compiled a 62–60–3 record, including three wins in four bowl games. Jones was the Big 8 Coach of the Year in 1984 and 1992. From 1984 to 1988, Jones led the Cowboys to the most successful period in school history at the time. With a talented roster that included running backs Barry Sanders and Thurman Thomas, wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes and quarterback and current Cowboy coach Mike Gundy, they went 44–15 over this five-year stretch, including the school's first three ten-win seasons.\nDays after the 1988 season, Oklahoma State and the NCAA released the results of an unusual joint investigation into the football program. The investigation revealed several major violations dating prior to Johnson's tenure, principally involvement in a \"bidding war\" for Dykes out of high school. The Cowboys were banned from bowl games for three years and from live television for two years, and they were also limited to 20 scholarships from 1989 to 1992. Jones was not directly implicated in any wrongdoing; indeed, the investigation found that no violations had taken place in two years. He was unable to put together another winning team due to the sanctions, and left OSU after the 1994 season. In Jones' last six years, the Cowboys won only seven games in Big Eight play, including three winless conference records. As it turned out, they would need almost the entire decade of the 1990s to recover; they would only have one winning season from 1989 to 2001. His 62 wins would be the most in school history until Gundy passed him in 2012.\nJones was also an NFL assistant coach with the Miami Dolphins from 1996 to 2003 and Oakland Raiders from 2004 to 2006. He is a member of the Gator Bowl, Arkansas and Oklahoma Halls of Fame.\nJones can be heard on weekdays on WWLS (AM) \"The Sports Animal\" in Oklahoma City, and on KYAL \"The Sports Animal\" in Tulsa. Pat also provides in-studio gameday commentary for Fox Sports Southwest college football programming."

The race was won by Louison Bobet, the second of his three consecutive wins.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1954 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. Seven national teams were sent, with 10 cyclists each from France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland and Luxembourg/Austria (the latter a combined team). France additionally sent five regional teams from 10 cyclists each, divided into North-East/Centre, West, South-East, Île-de-France and South-West. The combined team Luxembourg/Austria consisted of six Luxembourger cyclists, three Austrian cyclists and one from Liechtenstein. In total, 110 cyclists started the race.\nNotable absents were the Italian cyclists. In Italy, new sponsors had entered the market, named \"extra-sportives\" because they did not sell a product directly related to the sport. During the 1954 Giro d'Italia, this caused a strike, the Bernina strike. After this, the Italian federation decided not to send a team to the 1954 Tour de France. In May, Italian Cycling Federation head Adriano Rodoni announced Italian riders would not participate in the Tour.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1954 Tour de France was the first time that the Tour had started outside France, as it started in Amsterdam. Also new was the team time trial. Although around 1930 the Tour had seen stages in which the teams started separately, in 1954 the team time trial format was reintroduced in a way that only the team time counted. Also the split stages were reintroduced. Stage 4 was divided into two parts: the team time trial of 10.4 km (part A), and a regular stage of 131 km (part B), both run on the same day. Similarly, stage 21 was divided into a regular stage of 134 km (part A) and an individual time trial of 72 km (part B), also both run on the same day. There were two rest days, in Bordeaux and Lyon. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 19.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, Wout Wagtmans won the sprint, and took the yellow jersey. He would remain the leader until the team time trial in stage 4, when the French team won back enough time on the Dutch team for Bobet to take over the lead. In that time trial, over 10.4 km, the winning team was decided by adding the times of the three best cyclists per team. For the general classification, every cyclist got added his individual time. In the second part of the fourth stage, former winner Jean Robic hit a photographer during the sprint, fell down and had to give up.\nIn the eighth stage, Wagtmans had joined a breakaway, which won enough time on Bobet for Wagtmans to take back the yellow jersey. Wagtmans fell down in the eleventh stage, and although he managed to keep his lead until the start of the twelfth stage, he continued without morale. In the twelfth stage in the Pyrenees, three important riders attacked: Bauvin, Bahamontes and Malléjac. They stayed ahead, and Bauvin jumped to the first position in the general classification. Bobet was not far behind these three, and moved into the second place. In that twelfth stage, Hugo Koblet had fallen down, and lost 27 minutes, and his chances to win the Tour de France a second time. In the next stage, Koblet gave up.\nIn the fourteenth stage, the Swiss cyclists were fighting back. They were riding as fast as they could, and the leading group was getting smaller. Bauvin also could not keep up with that group, partly because he had a flat tire, and finished 8 minutes behind, losing the leading position. Bobet however could keep up with the Swiss pace, and took over the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.\nIn the sixteenth stage, Bauvin lost another 20 minutes, and dropped to sixth place. The Swiss cyclists had attacked Bobet where they could, but were unable to gain time on him. They had moved into second and third place of the general classification.\nIn the eighteenth stage, Bobet dominated, and dropped all of the other contenders. He won by a margin of one minute and 49 seconds, and his margin in the general classification was 12 minutes 49 seconds, which would normally be large enough for the victory. Bobet also won the individual time trial, and thereby increased his margin even more.\nThe Swiss cyclists could not attack Bobet anymore in the last stages, so Bobet won his second Tour de France. The Swiss team had performed well though, capturing the second and third place in the general classification, winning the team classification and having Kübler win the points classification.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 110 cyclists that started the 1954 Tour de France, 69 finished the race.\nThe points classification was calculated in the same way as in 1953, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1954, this was won by Ferdinand Kübler.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was almost the same as in 1953: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Federico Bahamontes won this classification.\nThe team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the Swiss team.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. At the end of the Tour de France, Lucien Lazaridès and François Mahé were leading this classification with equal points and shared the overall super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 19. This prize was won by Federico Bahamontes.\nAftermath.\nAfter he won the Tour de France, Bobet would later win the 1954 UCI Road World Championships. The next year he would win the 1955 Tour de France, thereby becoming the first cyclist to win three Tours in a row."

        "text": "The 1953 Tour de France was the 40th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 3 to 26 July. It consisted of 22 stages over .\nThe race was won by Louison Bobet, the first of his three consecutive wins. At first, internal struggles in the French national team seemed to work against Bobet, but when the team joined forces, he beat regional rider Jean Malléjac in the mountains.\nThe 1953 Tour de France saw the introduction of the points classification, which gives the green jersey to its leader. In 1953 this was won by Fritz Schär.\nInnovations and changes.\nChanges in the Tour formula were made: Only one time trial was used, instead of two the previous year; the time bonus for the first cyclist to cross a mountain top was removed; there were fewer mountain stages; the number of cyclists per team was increased from 8 to 10. Since all these changes were bad for 1952's winner Fausto Coppi, who had gained significant time in 1952 in the time trials and mountain stages, the Tour organisation was accused of favoring French riders.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1953 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. Seven national teams were sent, with 10 cyclists each from Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. France additionally sent five regional teams from 10 cyclists each, divided into Île-de-France, Center-North East France, South-East, West and South West. One Luxembourgian cyclist did not start, so 119 cyclists started the race.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the previous edition, Coppi, did not defend his title. The reasons were not clear: it could have been injury, but it was also possible that Coppi did not want to ride in the same team as his rival Gino Bartali, or that the Tour direction urged the Italian team not to select Coppi because he had dominated the 1952 Tour, or that Coppi chose to prepare for the 1953 UCI Road World Championships. The big favourites became Hugo Koblet and Louison Bobet.\nThe last five editions had been won by Italian and Swiss cyclists, so the French cycling fans were anxious for a French win. When team manager Marcel Bidot had selected Bobet as the French team captain, controversy arose. Bobet had shown his potential strength, but had already tried to win the Tour de France five times without succeeding. His team-mate Raphaël Géminiani thought that Bobet was not strong enough, after he did not finish the 1953 Giro d'Italia earlier that year.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1953 Tour de France started on 3 July, and had two rest days, in Bordeaux and Monaco. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 18.\nRace overview.\nIn the first two stages Fritz Schär won the sprint. The favourites remained calm. After the fourth stage, French Roger Hassenforder took the lead, but he soon lost it when the mountains appeared.\nHassenforder was ill, and could not follow in the mountains, so Schär took the lead back in the ninth stage. In the next stage, Hugo Koblet, the leader of the Swiss team, fell and had to give up, making Schär the undisputed leader of the Swiss team.\nJean Robic, the winner of the 1947 Tour de France, rode for the regional team from West. He was in great shape, and won the 11th stage, and even took the leading position in the general classification. In the next stage, Robic rode in the yellow jersey for the first and only time in his career. Robic had won the 1947 Tour de France, but only captured the lead in the ultimate stage, so he never wore the yellow jersey during that race. Robic was a good climber, but he was not heavy enough to be a good descender. It is said that the manager of his team had arranged bidons filled with lead, that would be given to Robic on the top of the mountains. This helped Robic to keep his lead on the descent.\nRobic lost the yellow jersey in the next stage, after he crashed and the French national team attacked. A large group of twenty five cyclists, without any of the favourites, had escaped and stayed away. Robic's team did not lose the jersey however, as first François Mahé took over the lead.\nIn the next stage, the favourites attacked again. Mahé could not keep up, and lost his leading position to his team-mate Jean Malléjac. The sprint was won by Nello Lauredi from the French national team, before his team-mate Bobet. Bobet was angry that Lauredi had won the sprint, because it made Bobet miss the one-minute time bonus for the winner of the stage. Bobet accused Lauredi and Géminiani of working against him, and during dinner it came to a fight. The French team captain intervened, and they found a solution: Bobet agreed to give his prize money to his team-mates, if they helped him win the Tour.\nIn that stage, Robic had fallen down, and lost many minutes, so he was no longer considered able to win the Tour. He did not start the fourteenth stage. At that point, Bobet was 3 minutes 13 seconds behind Malléjac.\nIn the eighteenth stage in the alps, Bobet followed Jesús Loroño who attacked on the Col de Vars. Bobet dropped him on the descend, and went alone to the Col d'Izoard. There was a group of early attackers ahead, including Bobet's team-mate Deledda. Deledda waited for Bobet, and helped him to reach the Izoard. Bobet could save his energy, and when they reached the Izoard, he left Deledda behind. The tactics had worked, and Bobet won more than 12 minutes on Malléjac and took the yellow jersey. He extended his lead by winning the time trial in stage 20, thereby showing that he was not only a good climber but also a fine time trialist. At that point, the Dutch team was leading the team classification, and the Dutch and French team started to work together to keep their leading positions in the general and team classification.\nFor the finish in Paris, eleven former Tour de France winners were present: Maurice Garin (who won the 1903 edition), Gustave Garrigou (1911), Philippe Thys (1913, 1914 and 1920), Lucien Buysse (1926), André Leducq (1930 and 1932), Antonin Magne (1931 and 1934), Georges Speicher (1933), Romain Maes (1935), Sylvère Maes (1936 and 1939), Roger Lapébie (1937) and Ferdinand Kübler (1950).\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 119 cyclists that started the 1953 Tour de France, 76 finished the race. The results showed that the pre-war greats were no longer dominant: all cyclists in the top ten had turned professional after the Second World War. The prize for best regional cyclist was won by second-placed Malléjac.\nFifty years after the first Tour de France, the 1953 Tour featured the introduction of the green jersey, for the leader in the points classification (usually seen as the \"best sprinter's\" jersey), at that time called the . The classification was based on the points system as it had been used from the 1905 Tour de France to the 1912 Tour de France. The points classification was not only added to celebrate the 50 years since the first race, but also to have the sprinters race hard for the entire race. The calculation method came from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1953, this was won by Fritz Schär.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was almost the same as in 1952: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Jesús Loroño won this classification.\nThe calculation of the team classification was changed from the calculation in 1952. In 1953, it was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the Dutch team, with a small margin over the French team. South West did not finish with three cyclists so was not eligible for the team classification.\nThe 1952 Tour had seen the introduction of combativity awards, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after most stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. In 1953, this system was kept, with the addition of a classification that was led by the rider with the most points from votes in all stages, and an overall super-combativity award. This was won by Wout Wagtmans. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera on stage 16. This prize was won by Claude Colette.\nAftermath.\nThe 1953 Tour de France had two young rider making their debuts, Charly Gaul and André Darrigade. Gaul would later win the 1958 Tour de France, and Darrigade would win 22 stages in total, and win the points classification twice.\nIt was the last Tour that Gino Bartali rode. Bartali started eight Tours, and won two of them.\nThe winner of the 1953 Tour, Bobet, would also win the next two editions, and became the first rider to win three consecutive Tours."

        "text": "The Rockford Pro-Am Golf Tournament, also known as the Rockford ProAm, was a one-day tournament featuring golf professionals, sponsors and amateur golf enthusiasts in order to raise funds for special organizations. It was the longest free-standing pro-am (not attached to the PGA or LPGA) event in the United States. It was normally held in July following the John Deere Classic. More commonly known as just the Rockford Pro-Am, the event celebrated its 42nd anniversary in 2018.\nThere are normally 20-25 professionals are teamed up with teams of four amateurs.\nPast Rockford Pro-Am attendees include Arnold Palmer, Bob Hope, Kenny Perry, Fred Couples, Paul Azinger, Billy Mayfair, Russ Cochran, John Daly, Hale Irwin, Laura Davies, Jim Dent, Jim Thorpe, Calvin Peete, Dana Quigley, Larry Mize, Ben Crenshaw, Lee Janzen, Matt Kuchar, Zach Johnson, Brittany Lincicome, Ken Duke, David Hearn, Troy Merritt, Ryan Palmer, Kyle Stanley, Scott Piercy, Kevin Streelman, Chesson Hadley, Ted Potter, Jr, Cameron Tringale, Bud Cauley, Wesley Bryan, Patrick Rodgers, Brittany Lang, Stacy Lewis, Gerina and Martin Piller, Luke Guthrie, Scott Langley, DA Points, Emma Talley, Austin Ernst, Mariah Stackhouse.\nHistory.\nThe pro-am was started as a fund raiser for the three Rockford area hospitals in 1977 — Rockford Memorial Hospital, St. Anthony Hospital and SwedishAmerican Hospital and was initially hosted by the Rockford Country Club from 1977 to 1996. This was changed to being a benefit for non-profit organizations, three picked per year by the organizers.\nMany celebrities and professional golfers have come to the event. For a few years in the early 1980s, comedian and ultimate golf enthusiast Bob Hope would come to entertain at a benefit gala at the then-newly opened MetroCentre then play in the pro-am the next day. Other entertainers who participated included Hope's long-time friend and fellow comedian George Burns and the star of TV's Wonder Woman Lynda Carter.\nOther pros who made appearances include Gary Player, Chi-Chi Rodríguez, Jim Thorpe, Lee Trevino and LPGA veteran Nancy Lopez.\nIn September 2022, program organizers announced that all future Rockford Pro-Am tournaments would be discontinued, citing the inability to finance the appearance of pro golfers at events and a lack of sponsorships. After 43 years, the Rockford Pro-Am was the longest-running individual event of its kind in the country, traditionally held at Aldeen Golf Club, 1902 Reid Farm Rd. in Rockford. The tournament was last played in 2019, and was canceled due to the 2020 pandemic prior to the official closing announcement in 2022."

        "text": "The 1951 Tour de France was the 38th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 4 to 29 July. It consisted of 24 stages over . The race started outside Île-de-France for the first time since 1926; a change that remained permanent beyond 1951 with the exceptions of 1963, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 2003.\nThe race was won by Swiss cyclist Hugo Koblet. Koblet used his time-trial abilities to win large amounts of time. Dutch cyclist Wim van Est made fame, not only by becoming the first Dutch cyclist to lead the Tour de France, but more by falling down a ravine in the leader's jersey.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1951 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. The three major cycling countries in 1951, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 12 cyclists. Other countries sent teams of 8 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain. The French regional cyclists were divided into four teams of 12 cyclists: Paris, Île-de-France/North-West, East/South-East and West/South-West. The last team of eight cyclists was made up out of cyclists from the French North African colonies. In the end, Luxembourg only sent 7 cyclists, so altogether this made 123 cyclists. There were 68 French cyclists (of which 1 French-Moroccan and 7 French-Algerian), 12 Italian, 12 Belgian, 8 Dutch, 8 Spanish, 8 Swiss and 7 Luxembourgian cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1951 Tour de France started in Metz; it was the second time after the 1926 Tour de France that the start of the Tour de France was not in or near Paris. \nUnlike in previous years, the route was no longer around the perimeter of France, and the Massif Central mountains were visited for the first time. There were two rest days, in Limoges and Montpellier.\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 20.\nRace overview.\nOn the first stage, Hugo Koblet attacked almost immediately from the start. The peloton got back to him after . Koblet stayed calm for the next stages, until the individual time trial in stage seven, which he won. Initially, Bobet was reported to have won the time trial by one second. Koblet protested against the result, and argued that the intermediate timings showed that Bobet could not have won. The Tour de France jury agreed that Bobet's time was off by one minute, and Koblet was given the stage victory by 59 seconds. Koblet's rival Raphaël Géminiani after the stage said: \"If there were two Koblets in the sport I would retire from cycling tomorrow.\"\nIn the eleventh stage, Koblet attacked after . He was followed by Louis Deprez for a short while, but when Deprez fell back, Koblet was on his own. It was a hot day, and the other cyclists did not believe that Koblet's escape had any chance. When the peloton heard that Koblet was already three minutes ahead, they started to chase him. They worked together for more than 100 km, but couldn't reach Koblet, who won the stage with a margin of more than two and a half minutes. Directly after Koblet finished, he used a stopwatch to measure the time gap, because he did not trust the Tour's time keepers anymore. The other cyclists were amazed that Koblet had been able to defend his lead against all the other cyclists.\nIn the twelfth stage, Dutch cyclist Wim van Est escaped, won the stage and took the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. He was the first Dutch cyclist to do so. Van Est was inexperienced in the mountains that showed up in the thirteenth stage, but did his best to defend his lead. Going up the Aubisque, Van Est punctured and lost time. He tried to gain back time on the descent by following Magni, a fast descender. Van Est could not follow, and crashed. He remounted and rode down again, but took too much risk and fell down a ravine. His fall was broken by trees, 75 meters down. Spectators helped him to climb back, by handing him a rope made from inner tubes. In the next stage, Van Est fell down a ravine while defending his position, and had to abandon the race. Gilbert Bauvin took over the lead. Géminiani crossed the finish line first in that stage, but he was set back to fourth place by the jury.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Coppi attacked. Koblet punctured, but chased back and reached Coppi, and outsprinted him to win the stage, and thanks to the minute bonification time as stage winner took over the lead. In the sixteenth stage, that seemed not too hard because there were almost no mountains, Coppi collapsed and lost more than half an hour. This was said to be caused by grief over his brother's death, although other accounts said it was because of food poisoning. His teammates and former rivals Gino Bartali and Fiorenzo Magni helped him until the end of the stage.\nThe Mont Ventoux was climbed in the seventeenth stage for the first time in Tour de France history. Bobet escaped and won the stage, while Koblet was able to stay with his competitors. After that stage, second-placed rider Géminiani was no longer trying to beat Koblet, but instead focussed on defending his second place against Bobet. Koblet stayed out of problems for the rest of the race, and won the time trial in the 22nd stage with a large margin; he even overtook Bartali who had started 8 minutes earlier.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 123 cyclists that started the 1951 Tour de France, 66 finished the race.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was almost the same as in 1950: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Raphaël Géminiani won this classification.\nThe team classification was calculated by adding the times in the general classification of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the French team, with a large margin over the Belgian team. The other three teams that started, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and North Africa, did not finish with three cyclists so were not eligible for the team classification. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Lautaret on stage 21. This prize was won by Gino Sciardis. The special award for the best regional rider was won by eighth-placed Gilbert Bauvin.\nAftermath.\nHugo Koblet would be unable to defend his title in the 1952 Tour de France, as he was injured. After that, Koblet never reached the heights that he was able to reach in 1951. Second-placed Géminiani said that he regarded himself as the winner, because Koblet did not count because he was not human.\nRavine, who fell down a Van Est wearing the leader's yellow jersey, starred in an advert for watch-making company Pontiac, that said \"His heart stopped but his Pontiac kept time.\""

        "title": "Rugby union in Brazil",
        "text": "Rugby union in Brazil is a rapidly growing sport, with rugby union increasing in popularity at universities across Brazil.\nRugby union is played regularly in all of Brazil's 26 states and in the Federal District. The sport is not widely played in schools, but is common in universities, more specifically the South, South East as well as parts of Amazon and the North East. The South East usually supplies the largest number of players to the national side. As of 2016, rugby is played by about 60,000 Brazilians and has experienced sizeable growth in the country.\nBrazil also competes in the South American tournaments sevens.\nThe women's national team is the strongest in South America, and finished in 10th place at the 2009 Rugby Sevens World Cup in Dubai.\nIn 2020, Brazil started a professional franchise in the new Superliga Americana de Rugby.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union is administered by the Brazilian Rugby Confederation (\"Confederação Brasileira de Rugby\", or CBRu), founded in 2010. It is the successor of the União de Rugby do Brasil (founded in 1963) and the Associação Brasileira de Rugby (founded in 1972). It became a member of the International Rugby Board in 1995. The confederation has six affiliate state federations: Gaúcha (Rio Grande do Sul), Catarinense (Santa Catarina), Paranaense (Paraná), Paulista (São Paulo), Mineira (Minas Gerais), and Fluminense (Rio de Janeiro). Other state federations are unaffiliated with the CBRu. \nHistory.\nRugby was brought to Brazil by the British in the late nineteenth century. The first recorded Brazilian club was founded in 1891, in Rio de Janeiro. In 1895 rugby was introduced in São Paulo Athletic Club. The first recorded match took place in 1926 between São Paulo and Santos city representatives and matches between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states were played almost every year between the 1926 and 1963.\nIn 1932 Brazil hosted the Junior Springboks, while in 1936 it was visited by the British and Irish Lions, in their way back from Argentina. It was in 1950 that the Brazilian national team was formed again and it debuted in the South American Rugby Championship in 1951. In 1964, São Paulo hosted for the first time the South American Championship and finished second to Argentina. It would be only in 2018 that such result would be bested. Between the late 1960s and early 1990s, Brazil disputed with Paraguay the 4th place in the South American Championship, always behind Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. Until the 1970s, most players were of British and Argentine origins, but the sport started to have most Brazilian players from the 1970s. \nBrazil has also been visited by at least two French tours - that of 1974 and that of 1985.\nIn 1988, rugby was being played in only three of the Brazilian states. However, some progress had been made - in 1963, it was recorded that 95% of Brazilian players were foreigners, and there were only four clubs; by 1988, 75% of Brazilian rugby players were native born, and there were thirty five clubs. São Paulo concentrated the vast majority of the clubs and it is still the hotbed of the sport in the country, although Southern states (Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul) emerged as competitors to São Paulo's hegemony from the 1990s. \nIn 2004, Brazil won the first South American Women's Sevens Championship and is still the biggest South American champion.\nOn 9 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that rugby sevens would be part of the 2016 Summer Olympics which will be held in Rio de Janeiro.\nNational team.\nThe national team have been playing international matches since the 1950s but have yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup.\nThe Brazil national rugby union team won five South American Championship B and is now playing the South American Championship A. The Brazil national team are generally ranked around 30th in the world, and have been ranked as the 3rd best South American team since they passed Paraguary in the world rankings in 2008.\nThe women's national rugby sevens team is the best in South America, and has won all the sevens championships ever played, without losing a single match.\nDomestic organisation.\nThe domestic club competition is the Campeonato Brasileiro de Rugby, or \"Super 10\", which has been contested annually since 1964.\nIn television.\nThe only way to watch rugby union in Brazil is through paid subscriptions, but the vast majority of Brazilians don't have paid TV, resulting in the sport being fairly unknown by the majority of the population. The first rugby union matches shown in Brazil was on ESPN during the 1999 Rugby World Cup (only highlights).\nThe 2003 Rugby World Cup was the first live broadcast in the country by ESPN, thanks to the ABR efforts to make the IRB send the signal freely to the country.\nIn 2007 Rugby World Cup ESPN got the 2nd place in audience with the paid channels, having a great coverage of the event sending reporters to France.\nIn 2011 Pan American Games Rede Record (open air TV) broadcast some Brazilian matches of rugby sevens.\nIn 2016, RedeTV! made the first rugby union live broadcast on Brazilian open air TV, showing Brazil's matches at South American Rugby Championship.\nNowadays the Rugby World Cup, Six Nations Championship, Rugby Champions Cup and The Rugby Championship are the main events broadcast by ESPN Brasil."

        "text": "Ronald Henry Anderson (born January 21, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. He who played 28 games in the National Hockey League with the Washington Capitals during the 1974–75 season. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1968 to 1978, was mainly spent in the American Hockey League. After his career he coached at the American collegiate level, and later joined NHL management.\nPlaying career.\nAnderson played collegiate hockey for two years at Boston University where he registered 87 points in 62 games for the Terriers. Anderson's scoring touch with BU didn't go unnoticed by the Boston Bruins who signed him as a free agent in 1972. He would play 2 seasons with their AHL affiliate the Boston Braves in 1972–73 and 1973–74. The NHL expanded by two teams in 1974–75, adding teams in Kansas City, Missouri and Washington, D.C. The expansion Washington Capitals selected him 34th from the Boston Bruins in the 1974 NHL Expansion Draft. He played 28 games during their inaugural season, tallying 9 goals and 7 assists for 16 points. He also spent time that year with the Richmond Robins, the AHL affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers. After one more season in the minors Anderson headed to Europe and won a 2nd league title with Villacher SV followed by one more season on Wiener EV before retiring as a player in 1978.\nCoaching.\nAnderson continued his hockey career, turning almost immediately to coaching when he became a mid-season replacement for the Welland Steelers. In 1980–81 he joined the staff at Merrimack as an assistant and was picked as the replacement for Bruce Parker on the eve of the Warriors' return to Division I. After finishing as runner-up in the last Division II championship for 8 years, Anderson led Merrimack as a concurrent D-I independent and ECAC East member for the next five years as it tried to find a permanent home. Despite the difficulties of not being in a major conference the Warriors steadily improved until they compiled a magnificent 34-win season in 1987–88, the best in the history of the school (as of 2016). Their performance couldn't have come at a better time because the NCAA expanded the playoff and Anderson's team became the first independent squad invited to the postseason since 1960. Not satisfied with simply making the cut, Merrimack dropped the first game to Hockey East champion Northeastern before routing them in the second game to take the opening series 10-8 on aggregate. In the quarterfinals they defeated eventual champion Lake Superior State 4-3 in the first game before their luck ran out and the Warriors were drubbed 5-0 to lose the series.\nAfter another stellar season Merrimack was finally accepted into a major conference, joining Hockey East for the 1989–90 season. Their winning ways, however, didn't continue with their new, full-Division-I schedule. Anderson's team won only 10 games that campaign and would improve only marginally over the next few years. For their first nine seasons in Hockey East the Warriors would come close but never achieve a winning season. Between 1990 and 1997 Anderson was unable to get a single postseason series victory, going 1-9 in the Hockey East tournament. In 1998, however, they shocked the conference by defeating his top-ranked alma mater Boston University twice to reach the semifinals. Before the second round began Anderson was told that his contract would not be renewed and the 7-2 loss to Boston College turned out to be his last game behind the bench.\nManagement.\nAnderson accepted a position as an amateur scout for the Chicago Blackhawks in 1999 and served in that capacity for 9 seasons before being named Director of Player Recruitment in 2008. Anderson continues to serve in that capacity as of 2017 and has seen his name etched on the Stanley Cup three times as a result (2010, 2013 and 2015).\nCareer statistics.\nHead coaching record.\n^ "

        "title": "Tokyo Big6 Baseball League",
        "text": "The is an intercollegiate baseball conference that features six prominent universities in the Tokyo area. It is the oldest collegiate baseball conference in Japan. Before the 1936 establishment of the Japanese Baseball League and subsequent growth (after 1950) of Nippon Professional Baseball, the Big6 League was widely considered the highest level of baseball in Japan.\nAll games are played at Meiji Jingu Stadium in Kasumigaoka, Shinjuku in downtown Tokyo. Games are known to be rowdy and celebratory, with cheerleading squads (応援団, \"Ōendan\") and bands working themselves and the crowd into a frenzy.\nIt is also the origin of the Tokyo 6 Universities (, \"Tōkyō roku daigaku\") nickname that is given to the same six universities.\nHistory.\nThe league has its origins in the Waseda, Keio, and Meiji University League, a three-school conference that began play in 1914 (albeit irregularly). Waseda and Keio had held their first match in 1903. Hosei University joined the league as a guest in 1916 and officially in 1917; the \"Four Universities League\" expanded to admit Rikkyo in 1921 (becoming the \"Five Universities League\") and Tokyo in 1925. That year, the suspended Waseda-Keio series was revived for the first time in 19 years, leading to the foundation of the Six Universities League.\nIn 1926, with the cooperation of the federation, the Meiji Jingu Stadium was completed, and was later expanded to a capacity of 55,000 people in 1931. The Regents Cup was awarded for the fall league match. The league was suspended in 1943 due to World War II, but immediately after the end of the war, on October 28, 1945, a six-college alumni game was held, culminating in a game between Waseda and Keio University at Meiji Jingu on November 18.\nSince the end of the US occupation of Japan in 1952, there have been no interruptions in conference play.\nOn April 1, 2013, the league registered as a general incorporated foundation, the Tokyo Six Universities Baseball Federation.\nAccording to the league's website, 119 players and executives associated with Tokyo Big6 have been inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.\nSchedule and rules.\nThe six teams play short, eight-weekend seasons in the spring and autumn of each year. Each team plays a short series against each of the five other teams in the league. The series format is similar to a three-game playoff, where the first to two wins is given a series victory. Home field is alternated, and all games are played at Meiji Jingu Stadium. Should a team sweep the first two games, the third game is not played.\nThe champion of the league is determined by the team with the most series victories. The champion team is given the Emperor's Cup. This is unique in Japan in that the other Emperor's cups are given to national champions in other sports such as Emperor's Cup of Football. The spring champion is allowed to participate in the All Japan University Baseball Championship Series while the fall champion is allowed to compete in the Meiji Jingu Stadium Tournament.\nThe league uses rules that are similar to that of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League (and, until recently, the MLB National League): the designated hitter rule is not used, and the pitcher is required to bat. Also, unlike American college baseball, non-wood bats are banned.\nMembers.\n\"Current as of Autumn 2023\"\nChampions.\nHosei University and Waseda University are tied for the most league championships with 46 each. Meiji University has won 43 times and Keio University has captured 40 league titles. Rikkyo trails with 13, while the University of Tokyo has yet to win a championship.\n\"Current as of Autumn 2023\"\nRivalry.\nWaseda vs. Keio: \"Sōkeisen\".\nThe series between Waseda and Keio, , attracts the most attention and is greatly enjoyed by the students, not least because it causes classes at both universities to be canceled. The game is still broadcast on NHK and it is the only series played during the last week of the season.\nThe Sōkeisen actually predates the establishment of the Tokyo Big6 League by over 20 years, beginning in 1903. The games often caused much tension between the two student bodies, often spilling out of the stadium and leading to the cancellation of games.\nThe addition of Meiji (1914), Hosei (1917) and Rikkyo (1921) would do little to remedy the rivalry. This state would continue until the addition of Tokyo Imperial University and the official establishment of the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League.\nThe name is a combination of the two university's names first kanji characters and the character for battle or match, . \"Sō\", is the alternate reading of in (also from the short name, ), while is the first character of ."

        "text": "The Chile Open (also known as the Chile Dove Men+Care Open for sponsorship reasons) is a professional men's tennis tournament played on outdoor red clay courts in Santiago, Chile. The tournament was originally founded as the Chile International Championships in 1930 as a combined men's and women's tennis event. In its history it was held alternately in Viña del Mar city and in 2010, Colina. It is part of the ATP Tour 250 of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour and part of the four-tournament Golden Swing.\nHistory.\nFrom 1976 until 1981 this event was known as the Chilean International Open and was an ILTF Grand Prix Circuit affiliated men's tennis tournament. In 1992, Brazil suspended its three ATP tournaments. When the ATP resolved to keep these tournaments in Latin America, brothers Jaime and Álvaro Fillol decided to buy the organizing rights to hold one of these events in Chile. The first edition was held in Santiago in November 1993. In 1999, it was not held, due to the ATP's decision to reschedule the event to February 2000. In 2001, the tournament was moved to Viña del Mar. The event moved back to Santiago in 2010, eventually returning to Viña del Mar in 2012.\nFor the 2007 edition, the tournament switched to a 24-player round robin format. After problems with this format were discovered in other tournaments, the ATP decided to revert all round-robin events to the old play-off format. Thus, from the year 2008, the tournament was back to its old 32-player draw scheme.\nAfter many sponsorship renewing attempts, the tournament was folded mid-year after the 2014 edition and the tournament moved to Ecuador.\nMany top-ten players participated in this tournament, including Mats Wilander, Jim Courier, Jiří Novák, Marcelo Ríos, Carlos Moyá, Gustavo Kuerten, Àlex Corretja, Tommy Haas, Magnus Norman, Sergi Bruguera, Guillermo Coria, David Nalbandian, Gastón Gaudio, Fernando González, Tommy Robredo, Nicolás Lapentti, Álbert Costa, Alberto Berasategui, Emilio Sánchez, Guillermo Cañas, Mariano Puerta, Nicolás Massú, David Ferrer, Fernando Verdasco, Juan Mónaco, Rafael Nadal, and Félix Mantilla.\nOn 15 October 2019, Brasil Open organisers announced the date the tournament will return to Santiago for Chile Open comeback in 2020. On 19 November 2019, despite Chilean protests, ATP confirmed the event once again."

        "title": "Eddie Anderson (American football coach)",
        "text": "Edward Nicholas Anderson (November 11, 1900 – April 24, 1974) was an American football player and coach of football and basketball. He served as the head football coach at Columbia College in Dubuque, Iowa, now known as Loras College (1922–1924), DePaul University (1925–1931), the College of the Holy Cross (1933–1938, 1950–1964), and the University of Iowa (1939–1942, 1946–1949), compiling a career college football record of 201–128–15. Anderson was also the head basketball coach at DePaul from 1925 to 1929, tallying a mark of 25–21 Anderson played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Rochester Jeffersons in 1922 and the Chicago Cardinals from 1922 to 1925. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1971.\nPlaying and early coaching career.\nAnderson attended Mason City High School in Mason City, Iowa, before enrolling at the University of Notre Dame. He played for Knute Rockne from 1918 to 1921 and was a teammate of George Gipp. As a senior, he was named a consensus first team All-American and was the team captain of the 1921 Notre Dame football team. In his final three years at Notre Dame, the Irish had a record of 28–1. Anderson's only loss in his final three seasons was to Anderson's home state school, when Notre Dame lost to the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1921, 10–7.\nAnderson coached at Columbia College in Dubuque, Iowa, from 1922 to 1924, compiling a 16–6–1 record with one undefeated season. During that time, he was considered for an assistant coaching position at Iowa, but Iowa coach Howard Jones rejected the idea. Anderson served as a player/coach for the Chicago Cardinals (now Arizona Cardinals) professional football team in the early 1920s as well. He played on the Cardinals' controversial championship team in 1925.\nThat same year, Anderson enrolled at Rush Medical College in Chicago. While in Chicago, Anderson coached football at DePaul University, compiling a 21–22–3 record from 1925 to 1931. He also coached basketball at DePaul from 1925 to 1929, guiding them to a 25–21 record. After graduating from Rush, Anderson took a job as head football coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. He had a record of 47–7–4 in six years at Holy Cross from 1933 to 1938, including undefeated seasons in 1935 and 1937. During that time, Anderson also served as the head of eye, ear, nose, and throat clinic at Boston's Veterans Hospital.\nCoaching career at Iowa and military service.\nFirst stint.\nAnderson was hired as the 15th head football coach at the University of Iowa before the 1939 season. Iowa had a record of just 2–13–1 in 1937 and 1938 under Irl Tubbs, and the Hawkeyes had finished among the worst three teams in the Big Ten Conference standings every year in the 1930s except 1933. Iowa had won just one conference game in the last three years, and the team they beat, Chicago, announced that they would be dropping their football program following the 1939 season.\nAnderson sought to change Iowa's fortunes immediately. He put the 85 football players who showed up for spring practice through an intense workout. Only 37 players would earn football letters in 1939 for Iowa. Anderson felt the 1939 team could be a good one if the starters played significant minutes. Before the first game, \"The Des Moines Register\" had a small note stating that \"a set of iron men may be developed to play football for Iowa.\"\nThe 1939 Hawkeyes, nicknamed the \"Ironmen\", would become one of the greatest teams in school history and certainly the most romanticized. Led by Nile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner, the Hawkeyes put together a 6–1–1 record, the best overall record in the Big Ten, though Ohio State edged out Iowa for the conference title. Many of Anderson's players played complete games during that season for the Hawkeyes. Anderson was named national coach of the year by several organizations. Jim Gallager of the \"Chicago Herald-American\" wrote, \"It's doubtful if any coach in football history ever accomplished such an amazing renaissance as Eddie Anderson has worked at Iowa.\"\nAnderson was given a Cadillac by Iowa fans and a bonus by the university after his performance during the 1939 season. He was also given a significant share of stock in Amana Refrigeration by the founder and CEO of the company, George Foersner, as a reward for his coaching that season. When Anderson retired from football in the late 1960s, he cashed in his stock for over a million dollars.\nAfter two more average seasons, Iowa started the 1942 season with a 6–2 record and was in contention for the Big Ten title, but consecutive road conference losses at Minnesota and Michigan to end the season doomed Iowa's chances. After that season, Anderson took a leave of absence to serve in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. Iowa left the football program in the hands of interim coaches Slip Madigan and Clem Crowe while Anderson was gone from 1943 to 1945.\nAnderson was a gifted doctor who performed at the University of Iowa Hospital in the morning before coaching in the afternoon. He had been studying urology under the Head of Urology at the hospital. When Anderson returned in 1946, he was told that if he retired from coaching, he would be named the successor to Dr. Alcock. Anderson turned down the request and continued practicing medicine on a part-time basis.\nSecond stint.\nBy the time Anderson had returned from the service, Iowa football was again in the cellar of the Big Ten. Before the 1946 season, Anderson was hospitalized for 19 days with a parasite infection. He returned to lead Iowa to four wins in their first five games, which was as many wins as Iowa had during his three-year absence. Still, Iowa slumped to a 5–4 final record, leading two former players to write a scathing editorial about Anderson. The editorial asked, \"How long will Dr. Anderson ride on the laurels that Nile Kinnick won for him?\"\nIn 1947, a 2–2–1 start was followed by three straight losses. One day before Iowa's final game at Minnesota, Anderson submitted his resignation at Iowa, citing \"considerable loose talk\" among Iowa fans as one reason. The Hawkeye football team responded with a powerful effort against Minnesota, defeating the Gophers, 13–7. Fans begged Anderson to reconsider, and the Iowa athletic board denied his resignation, promising him a larger coaching staff and other football improvement s. Anderson decided to stay, saying, \"I'm glad we got things straightened out.\" Anderson used his larger coaching staff to hire Leonard Raffensperger as the head of the freshman team.\nAfter two more average seasons in 1948 and 1949, Anderson was approached again by Holy Cross, which now had a coaching vacancy. Ohio State made a rare concession and offered their football coach faculty tenure, so Anderson made the same request to Iowa athletic director Paul Brechler. Brechler could not promise Anderson anything, so Anderson resigned and took the head coaching position at Holy Cross. He had a 35–33–2 record in eight years at Iowa.\nLater life, death, and honors.\nAnderson returned to Holy Cross, where he coached 15 more years from 1950 to 1964. He posted a record of 82–60–4 in his second stay at Holy Cross. For his career, he coached 39 seasons at four schools and compiled a record of 201–128–15. He was the fourth coach in college football history to reach 200 wins.\nAfter resigning at Holy Cross in 1964, Anderson was named the chief of outpatient services at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Rutland, Massachusetts. He also served a school for mentally ill children. Anderson later moved to Clearwater, Florida before passing away of a heart attack in 1974.\nAnderson was inducted into the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 1962 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. Anderson gave the acceptance speech for that year's class at the College Football Hall of Fame. He summarized his coaching philosophy when he said, \"The victory most savored and cherished is the one that didn't come about by beating the rules, but by playing within them, where defeat is only a condition of the moment.\"\nIn 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" selected Eddie Anderson as the 45th greatest sports figure in the history of the state of Iowa."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1965–66",
        "text": "M.J.K. Smith captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1965–66, playing as England in the 1965-66 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. The 5-Tests series ended in 1–1 draw. Although they failed to reclaim the Ashes this was not unexpected as the Australian press labelled them the weakest MCC team to arrive in Australia and the bookmakers were giving odds of 7/2 on their winning the series. These views rapidly changed as they set about winning their state matches with exciting, aggressive cricket and by the First Test the odds against them had been reduced to evens. Lindsay Hassett said \"other teams from England may have been better technically but none had tried so hard to make the game as interesting as possible\". Financially the tour's receipts were much lower than in 1962–63 due to the number of rain-affected games in a wet Australian summer and the general doldrums of the sixties.\nIn October, the team played two matches in Colombo during a stopover on the voyage to Australia, although this was the first England tour of Australia where the team travelled by air throughout the journey. After leaving Australia in February, they played a three-match Test series in New Zealand and finally two matches in Hong Kong on the way home.\nThe manager.\n\"They had made no promised on arrival about 'brighter cricket' – that tiresome phase – but they had aimed to play better cricket, and by and large events had shown that taking the initiative brought the best results. Everyone knew who was behind this philosophy; it was Doug Insole, chairman of the selectors, and, of course, Billy Griffith, the tour manager.\"\nBilly Griffith was an amateur wicket-keeper for Cambridge University and Sussex and the first secretary of the MCC to have been a Test player. He had been a glider pilot for the 6th Airborne Division during the Second World War, fighting at D-Day and Arnhem and winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. He became Secretary of Sussex after the war (as well as captain in the 1946 season) and was the player-manager and reserve wicket-keeper on the tour of the West Indies in 1947–48. When used as a makeshift opener on his Test debut he made 140 in six hours and later played two Tests in South Africa, the only wicket-keeper to be used between 1946 and 1959 when the great Godfrey Evans was available. The decline of amateur cricket in English county cricket and the increasing professionalism of the game led to dull, lifeless cricket as teams were determined to avoid defeat and viewed games as a job rather than entertainment (ironically the keenest cricketer on the tour was Geoff Boycott, a noted stonewaller). There had been a surge in gate receipts after the war, but this fell rapidly in the 1960s as other forms of entertainment became available to the public. Griffith had become Secretary in 1962 and oversaw the official merging of amateur and professional for the 1963 season, which prevented him from managing the MCC tour of Australia in 1962–63, except for one month when he flew out to relieve the Duke of Norfolk. Aware of M.J.K. Smith's natural caution the MCC gave Griffith extraordinary powers granting him overall control of cricket on the tour. Fortunately, he did not resort to these as he preferred more diplomatic means, but he urged attacking cricket in the tour games, notably against Western Australia. Normally the MCC manager took care of the players and social side of the tour, as there were many functions to attend. The Assistant-Manager was Jack Ikin who had toured Australia in 1946–47, who oversaw the tour finances, collecting gate money on behalf of the MCC, booking hotels and making the travel arrangements.\nThe captain.\n\"...he strolled in with an open-necked shirt, a white linen jacket which appeared to have been slept in for a week and a carry-cot containing a slumbering junior member of the Smith dynasty. Apparently Mrs Smith had gone shopping and M.J.K. was left holding the baby. Despite an Oxford education his accent was utterly classless and between questions to which he appeared to be paying no attention whatever, he applied himself to solving the crossword in the latest Times to arrive from Britain. \"Good heavens\", growled one of Australia's senior cricket correspondents, \"what have we here?\" What we all had on that tour was the affable companionship of one of the most popular England captains ever to tour anywhere. It never occurred to him to leave the baby, let alone his wife, at home while he led the fight for the Ashes.\"\nMichael John Knight Smith, better known as M.J.K. Smith or Mike Smith, is remembered as one of England's most popular cricket captains and England's last double international, in cricket and rugby. He was captain of Oxford University (1956), Warwickshire (1957–67) and England (1963–66) and unlike Len Hutton, Peter May or Ted Dexter rode '...the side with a loose rein, believing it knew where it was going and need only an occasional tug to keep it on the right course. I think most players appreciated this and his openness as a person brought a better response on the field.' He thought that any bowler good enough to play for England knew what field suited him best and generally let his men play in their own style, though this resulted in slow over rates as he did not chivvy them along. Even the truculent fast bowler John Snow '...thought he was very astute in his handling of players...' and recalled '...Mike Smith adding a few words of congratulations in his thoroughly open, absent-minded-professor sort of way'. E.W. Swanton reported that 'Smith, though outwardly unconventional and in manner casual to a degree, succeeds as a captain for the conventional reasons. He is thoughtful for his players, unselfish, does not 'fuss' them or panic, shows a grasp of the situation which they deem in general sensible and not least gives an inspiring personal lead in the field'.\nDespite wearing spectacles Smith was heavy run-maker in County cricket and passed 2,000 runs a season each year from 1957 to 1962, including 3,245 runs (57.94) in 1959. Fred Trueman thought \"there is probably nobody in the world who plays the off-spinner better\", but Smith's fragility against fast bowling meant that he could not hold down a regular place in the Test team. It was not his only failing as 'Mike is widely remembered...as a very unreliable runner between the wickets. Warwickshire tales of woe in this respect are numerous and I can remember a call between them in 1964 going something like \"No A.C.\" – Yes, Mike\" – Wait A.C.\" – \"Damn it, Mike\" – \"Sorry A.C.\" He was, however, a mantis-like close fielder who took a record 593 catches for Warwickshire and 53 catches in 50 Tests for England. His outwardly nonchalant captaincy hid a good cricketing brain and he took a rebuilt Warwickshire side to third, fourth and second place in the County Championship in 1962–64.\nSmith was known as a good tourist and was made captain of the England tour of India in 1963–64 when Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey were unavailable and without England's top bowlers Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. He lost the toss five times in a row and had so many injuries and illnesses that in the Second Test at Madras Smith had to use three batsmen, two wicket-keepers and six bowlers. When Mickey Stewart was unable to play after the first day because of dysentery he seriously considered calling up the cricket journalist Henry Blofeld, but managed to survive with just 10 men. Smith became the first England captain to draw all fives Tests in a series (it was the third time India had done this) and was considered to have done well to avoid defeat. It was his best series with 306 runs (51.00) and when Ted Dexter retired after losing 1–0 to Bobby Simpson's Australia in 1964 Smith was made captain for England's last tour of South Africa before the Basil d'Oliveira Crisis. He won 1–0 against the talented Springboks, the last captain to defeat them in a Test series until 1996–97. He beat a weak New Zealand 3–0 and lost 1–0 to South Africa at home in 1965, but was appointed captain for the MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66 with Cowdrey as vice-captain, despite support for the Kent captain at Lord's. He drew with both Australia (1–1) and New Zealand (0–0) and after losing the First Test against the West Indies in 1966 by an innings he was replaced by Cowdrey and retired at the end of the following season. Smith returned to Warwickshire in 1970 and did well enough to be recalled against Australia in 1972 before finally retiring in 1975.\nBatting.\n\"England always had enough runs in the bank – this was the only MCC tour to Australia wherein seven men had an average over 40. True, the captain's was only 17. Yet in contrast to events nine years later no one agitated for his removal.\nUnlike the previous three tours England arrived in Australia with some capable opening batsmen, Bob Barber, Geoff Boycott and John Edrich. Barber had been a simple push and run player for Lancashire before transferring to M.J.K. Smith's Warwickshire in 1963 and flowered into the most attacking opener in England. He was an excellent foil to Boycott's pedestrian run-making and they were the best opening pair England had had in years. Barber's 185 in five hours in the Third Test at Sydney – adding 234 for the first wicket with Boycott (84) – was one of E.W. Swanton's most treasured moments. Like his captain the young Boycott still wore steel-rimmed spectacles and lacked the certainty of his later years with contact lenses, but E.W. Swanton clearly remembers his 'burning ardour for the game in an age wherein even cricket is tainted with 'work to rule'.' The Fifth Test saw the worst of him, as he scored slowly, hogged the strike and ran out Bob Barber. In 1965 John Edrich had a First Class run of 139, 121 not out, 205 not out, 55, 96, 188, 92, 105 and 310 not out, the last innings against New Zealand in the Third Test at Headingley, where he hit 52 fours and 5 sixes, but M.J.K. Smith declared before he could overtake Gary Sobers record 365. In the following Test he was hit on the head by a Peter Pollock bouncer and thereafter was a tenacious left-hander who made solid rather than stylish innings. Eric Russell was a graceful Scottish opener whose career was limited by the dominance of Boycott and Edrich. He was injured in the only Test he played on the tour, where he came in last and held out for 10 minutes in an unbeaten duck.\nKen Barrington had made 582 runs (72.75) in the 1962-63 Ashes series and 531 runs (75.85) in 1964 – \"batting with bulldog determination and awesome concentration\". His 256 at Old Trafford remains England's highest post-war century against Australia and his Test batting average of 58.67 is easily the highest of any English batsman since Len Hutton. Ian Chappell wrote with feeling \"Every so often you encounter a player whose bat seem about a yard wide. It's not, of course. It just seems that way. England's Ken Barrington was one, our own Bill Lawry another. Gee, they were hard to dislodge\". In 1965 he had been controversially dropped from the England team for taking over seven hours to make 137 against a weak New Zealand attack, but when quick runs were needed in the Fifth Test at Melbourne he surprised everyone by smashing a hundred off 122 balls and bringing up the century with a six into the stands. Colin Cowdrey was the most experienced England batsmen – this was the fourth of his six tours in Australia – and was a classic strokemaker whose perfect timing was a great asset on hard Australian wickets. He was accused of overly careful batting on the tour, but like Barrington hit out in the Fifth Test. Peter Parfitt was a pleasing young Middlesex batsman who had toured in 1962–63, but who never really succeeded against Australia and did not play in any of the Tests. The captain M.J.K. Smith enjoyed playing against the state and country sides, but was the only batsmen who failed to cash in on a weak Australian attack and never passed 50 in the Tests.\nJohn Murray and Jim Parks were both decent wicket-keeper-batsmen, and Parks played in all five Tests due to his superior batting, hitting 3 sixes and 4 fours in his 52 in the First Test. Barry Knight was a big-hitting all rounder who enjoyed thumping county sides and weak Test attacks like India and New Zealand, but struggled against Australia. Fred Titmus had proved to be a real find in 1962–63, and improved upon his reputation, making three 50s in the series and averaging 64.50 even though he batted a number 9. He took guard outside the leg-stump, giving the bowler a clean view of the wicket, but moved over quickly and batted solidly. David Allen was another spinning all-rounder and made an unbeaten 50 in the Tests, but otherwise failed.\nBowling.\n\"Of MCC's cluster of fastish bowlers Brown was laid low with bursitis, or a sort of house-maid's knee of the elbow, David Larter, that tall, pleasant if somewhat remote young man who enjoys the unique distinction of having toured Australia twice with the MCC without being chosen for a Test Match, could only bowl half-pace because of a strained side, while Ken Higgs, faithful trier if ever there was one but who looked a little plain on Australian pitches, had picked up a chill...so the England fast attack consisted perforce of Jones and Knight, the latter until a few weeks previously having been vegetating quietly down in Essex. Thank goodness Boycott was fit again, it was seriously said, as his bowling might well be useful!\"\nThe retirement of England's great new-ball partnership of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham left a yawning gap in the England attack. The fast bowler John Snow would take 31 wickets (22.83) in the 1970–71 Ashes series, but he was not chosen for the tour and went to South Africa to play club cricket. Brown was 6'4\" tall and was noted for his steep bounce and was regarded as England's best new ball bowler, his 5/63 forced Australia to follow on in the Third Test at Sydney. The Scottish seamer David Larter was even taller at 6' 7\" and had a ridiculously long run, but he lacked self-confidence, and an ankle injury on the tour ended his career. Jeff Jones was a Welsh left-arm bowler of genuine pace and the father of Simon Jones he took 6/118 in the Fourth Test, but troubled the umpires by running on the pitch in a state game and consequently missed the First Test. He produced one or two hostile spells in the series and took important wickets. Ken Higgs revived his career in 1965 as Brian Statham's new ball partner for Lancashire and took 4/47 and 4/96 against the powerful South African batting at the Oval in 1965. Due to stomach cramps he was not used much in Australia, but took 17 wickets (9.23) in New Zealand, then 24 wickets (25.45) back home against the West Indies. With England's bowlers laid low, the all-rounder Barry Knight was called up. A veteran of the 1962–63 Ashes series, he liked to drop the ball short, but lacked the pace to worry the Australians. Even so, he took 4/84 in the Second Test when the hosts were out for 358 on a flat wicket. Geoff Boycott was a useful medium-paced bowler in his youth, known to wear his cap backwards as he bowled, and was used as the third new ball bowler in the Third and Fourth Tests. David Allen and Fred Titmus returned after their successful tour in 1962–63, but were only useful on the famous spinning wicket at Sydney, taking 4/47 and 4/40 in the second innings of England's victory. Elsewhere they were expensive and could only be used for containment. Ken Barrington had started life as a leg-spinner and was a good bowler at club level, as was Bob Barber, and commentators thought they should have been used more widely considering England's poor attack, but Smith only tried them when a draw was a foregone conclusion.\nFielding.\nEngland rarely matched Australia in the sharpness of their fielding, but this was regarded as the best fielding team England has sent in many years, and they \"moved in the field like flannelled dervishes\". John Murray was an old friend of Fred Titmus and kept wicket to him for Middlesex. He was recognised as the best glovesman in England, but was kept out of the Test team because he was not as good a batsman as his rivals. Jim Parks was the son of the all-rounder Jim Parks and father of the wicketkeeper Bobby Parks. A veteran who had been kept out of the England team by Godfrey Evans Parks was a fair batsman, but missed a vital stumping off Peter Burge that cost England a chance of winning the Second Test. In the slips there was Colin Cowdrey, who would take a record 120 Test match catches, M.J.K. Smith was a noted close fielder who rarely missed a chance and Ken Barrington took 58 catches for England. Peter Parfitt was regarded as one of the best first slips in England, but did not play in the Tests. Fred Titmus was a famous chatterbox with a habit of taking catches in mid-conversation, which worried Smith. Geoff Boycott began as a sluggish outfielder, but worked on his game until he could throw the ball in with accuracy from the boundary.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article – 1965–66 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1965–66 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1965–66 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article – 1965–66 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1965–66 Ashes series\""

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71",
        "text": "Ray Illingworth captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71, playing as England in the 1970–71 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They had a successful tour; however, it was an acrimonious one, as Illingworth's team often argued with their own management and the Australian umpires. When they arrived, the Australian selector Neil Harvey called them \"rubbish\", and others labelled them \"Dad's Army\" because of the seniority of the players, whose average age was over 30, but these experienced veterans beat the younger Australian team. They are the only touring team to play a full Test series in Australia without defeat.\nThe rest of the world.\nIn 1969–70, Australia were overwhelmed by South Africa in their last series until 1994. The 1970 South African tour of England was cancelled due to the Basil d'Oliveira Affair and concerns over anti-apartheid demonstrations that had led to barbed wire at Lord's. Rather than send an unprepared team to Australia, a Rest of the World XI was created mostly from overseas cricketers playing in the County Championship, managed by Freddie Brown, captained by Gary Sobers, and including the South Africans Eddie Barlow, Graeme Pollock, Peter Pollock, Mike Procter and Barry Richards. They could not be regarded as a national Test team, and the matches were given the status of 'unofficial Tests', but the runs scored and wickets taken were added to official Test statistics until it was decided by the I.C.C. that they should not count. England were beaten 4–1, but the only surprise was that they managed to win one game and almost won two others against what was arguably the strongest cricket team ever assembled.\nEngland's unbeaten run 1968-71.\nAt the beginning of the tour, England had lost only 1 of their previous 26 Tests and were halfway through their record-breaking 27 consecutive Tests without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne). This record was not recognised at the time, as the games against the Rest of the World XI, some of which England lost, were counted as Test matches. The record was subsequently equalled by Clive Lloyd's West Indies in 1981–84.\nThe manager.\n\"I hope to God we will get a result. I hope that both teams go into the match with a result in mind.\"\nThe series in Australia \"emphasised the gulf between players and administrators\", and John Snow wrote: 'I was sick of the biased attitude and incompetence which was apparent in cricket administration. David Clark was the MCC tour manager, Bernard Thomas of Warwickshire the assistant manager and physiotherapist, and G.C.A. Saulez the scorer. Clark had been the amateur captain of Kent in 1949–51 who was described by Ray Illingworth as \"an amiable, but somewhat ineffectual man\". and there were soon divisions between him and the players. John Snow had bowled over 50 eight-ball overs in the First Test and was rested for the state match against Western Australia, but Clark insisted that he practice in the nets with the other bowlers. Snow bowled a couple of desultory overs and Clark berated him for five minutes after which Snow told him \"that as far as my good conduct money was concerned he could swallow it\" and went walkabout until the next day. Ray Illingworth smoothed things over, but in Second Test Clark criticised both captains for cautious play and England for their short-pitched bowling. When asked by the press if he would prefer four more draws or a 3-1 Australian victory he replied \"I'd rather see four results\" as if they were drawn there might be no Ashes left to play for. Ray Illingworth only discovered this when he was asked for a comment by a journalist in the morning and the team when they read it in the newspapers. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour with the support of the players and Clark's influence declined. Clark's only ally was the vice-captain Colin Cowdrey, also from Kent, who became isolated as a result. Unlike his predecessors Illingworth insisted on good hotel accommodation, decent sporting facilities, better travel arrangements, higher allowances and pay and fought hard to get them, which was greatly appreciated by the players. In the final Sydney Test Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field when he took the team off because of the crowd throwing beer cans after the Snow-Jenner incident. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down and objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. When the team returned to England Illingworth said that \"all hell would break loose\" if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus (as had happened with Fred Trueman in the West Indies in 1953–54), but this did not happen. However, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow had to report to Lord's for a dressing down for their behaviour by the Secretary of the MCC Billy Griffith.\nThe captain.\n\"Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally the toughest English side I played against, and the experience of playing against them first up in my Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.\"\nWhen Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 after a contract dispute it looked like the 36-year-old off-spinner's Test career was over. However, he transferred to Leicestershire and was made county captain. Although he had never been captain his great experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have guided Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. He had an immediate effect on the unfancied Midlands side, which would take them to four one day trophies in the early 1970s and the County Championship in 1975. The selectors had long regarded Kent's Colin Cowdrey as England's natural captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had been in and out of the national side for years and had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was chosen over his rivals such as former captain Brian Close or vice-captain Tom Graveney as he was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's England collapsed to 61/5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2-0 and remained captain even when Cowdrey recovered. In 1970 Illingworth had yet to lose a Test and overall he captained England in 31 Tests in 1969-73, winning 12, drawing 14 and losing 5. The Yorkshireman was 'tough, combative, grudging, shrewd, and an instinctive reader of the game', and an experienced, non-nonsense captain who expected his team to play like professionals. David Gower wrote 'no matter how highly Ray might regard you as a player he would not have you in his team, come hell or high water, unless he was utterly convinced that you could do the job he had allocated to you'. He encouraged 'difficult' players like Geoff Boycott and John Snow who both responded with their best Test performances on the tour. 'Most of all, because he insisted on his \"own side\", he was able to get the best out of his players, both mentally and physically. He built up a tremendous team spirit which stood us in good stead on numerous occasions'. They tended to close ranks and treat the opposition, umpires, press and public as the enemy, an attitude that became prevalent amongst Test teams in the 1970s.\nBatting.\nEngland had a formidable batting line up and it is no coincidence that in this period they played 27 Tests without defeat. The weak Australian bowling was unable to dismiss them twice in the same Test, except the last which they lost anyway. They were exceptionally strong at the top of the order; Boycott and Luckhurst opened in the first five Tests, then Boycott and Edrich in the 6th and Edrich and Luckhurst in the 7th as injuries took hold. Together they added 995 runs for the first wicket at an average of 90.45, with five century and three half-century opening stands. The \"Great Accumulator\" Geoff Boycott had his best series making 657 runs (93.85) with two unbeaten centuries and his name became a byword for long, stonewalling innings. It is noteworthy that he performed best under Illingworth, an old Yorkshire colleague of great seniority who had no objection to his slow, deliberate play. John Edrich also had his most prolific series, making 648 runs (72.00) and two centuries, a stalwart left-hander with a formidable defence and always a thorn in Australia's side. Brian Luckhurst was a Kent opener who had already 'debuted' against the Rest of the World and made an unbeaten 113 in England's only victory. He did well again, making 455 runs (56.87) and two centuries despite badly bruised fingers, but unlike Boycott he was willing to hit the ball and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1971. England's middle order was more fragile. In 1970 the vice captain Colin Cowdrey was the only man to have played over a hundred Tests and had made more runs (7,228) than any other player, but was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour. He had always dreamed of leading England to victory in Australia, but each of his record six tours down under was made under a different captain and this was his fourth as vice-captain. Keith Fletcher was at the start of a promising career and had made few runs as yet, but in the 1970s he would become a leading England runmaker. Basil d'Oliveira was the best of the strokemakers, making 369 runs (36.90) in the series with a century at Melbourne. He was a brilliant Cape-Coloured batsman who qualified for England by residence in his mid-thirties, an unflappable player with a low backlift and powerful arms whose gentle, smiling face concealed a very determined man. His match-winning 158 against Australia at the Oval in 1968 led to his selection for the 1968-69 tour of South Africa and a cricketing crisis. John Hampshire was a dashing Yorkshire batsman who is the only England player to make a century on debut at Lord's, 107 against the West Indies in 1969, but never made another and was dropped after a short Test career. England's lower middle order added real strength with the wicket-keeper Alan Knott worth his place for his perky, unorthodox batting alone. Skipper Ray Illingworth made 476 runs (52.89) against the Rest of the World in 1970 and did well again in Australia. John Snow began and ended his cricketing life as a batsman and in 1969-71 averaged 34.50 in Tests, so could be regarded as another all-rounder.\nBowling.\n\"I have not met John Snow, the outstanding personality and most dominating cricketer of the 1970-71 Anglo-Australian series...To me, he is one of the most faithful and effective servants Nemesis ever employed...Never did he lose that aura of menace. When he loped in to bowl he wore malevolence like Mandrake wore a cloak...But for him, Redpath, Walters, Ian Chappell and probably even Paul Sheahan must have bloomed as most of them did against the West Indians in 1968-69.\"\nWhen England arrived in Australia Ray Illingworth boasted of his new ball fast bowlers \"The Derbyshire Demon\" Alan Ward and \"The Abominable Snow Man\" John Snow. The tall Ward was 'tall, lean, raw boned youngster with a fine pair of shoulders and powerful, rhythmical side-on action' compared to Frank Tyson, but suffered from assorted injuries and never made the expected impact in Test cricket. Instead he returned to England and the young Bob Willis was flown out to Australia as his replacement, though few people realised that this tall, gangling bowler with the chest on action would be England's fast bowling spearhead for the next 14 years. John Augustine Snow dominated the series with 31 wickets (22.83). Although the son of a country vicar who published two volumes of poetry, Snow revelled in his reputation as a big, fast bowler and emerged as Fred Trueman's successor in 1967-68 when he took a record 27 wickets (18.66) in the West Indies. He usually bowled within himself at fast-medium, but sent down a couple of quick balls every over as he varied his pace and Australia had no real answer to his fast, short pitched bowling. Snow had a reputation for being mercurial - he took only 7 wickets (71.57) in the state matches - strong-willed and difficult to handle, and his autobiography was suitably entitled \"Cricket Rebel\". Keith Fletcher said \"In 1970/71 John Snow was at his peak, obtaining pace and movement off the seam and troubling all the upper-order batsmen\". Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever provided good support to the two quick bowlers, Lever took 7/83 against the Rest of the World at the Oval, and Shuttleworth 5/47 in the First Test at Brisbane, but neither held down a regular Test place. Basil d'Oliveira helped with his tidy medium pace swing bowling and occasional off-spin. Illingworth himself was an off-spinner of nagging accuracy who contained batsmen rather than took wickets, conceding only 1.91 runs an over in Tests. If \"Illy\" was proof that spin bowlers mature slowly his partner Derek Underwood was a first class bowler from his teens and he would take his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th First Class wicket on the tour aged only 25. He bowled immaculate slow-medium spinners and used to say that bowling was a \"low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake\" as sooner or later every batsmen would make a mistake. On damp English wickets he earned the nickname \"Deadly\" for his ability to make the ball leap and turn, as when he took 7/50 against Australia at The Oval in 1968 to win the match and square the series with five minutes to spare. The reserve spinner Don Wilson was Illingworth's old Yorkshire \"spin twin\", but he and Underwood kept him out of the England team, like the other two he was an accurate bowler rather than a wicket-taker.\nFielding.\n\"There is some suggestion that we might be an elderly fielding side. But we shall work really hard at our fielding and make sure it reaches a high standard.\"\nRay Illingworth was an excellent close fielder and expected the same from his teams, once remarking 'When you've caught it get the bugger in straight away and get on w'th the game'. As a result, the England team fielded well throughout the series. Alan Knott had been chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1970 and was regarded as the finest keeper in the world. In this series he dismissed 24 Australian batsmen, a new Test record and Rod Marsh admitted that he learned much of his trade from watching \"Knotty\" in the 1970-71 series. Knott continually exercised before play and between balls and was a highly entertaining player whose partnership with his team-mate Derek Underwood was legendary. Others thought that the reserve keeper Bob Taylor was even better, a quiet, unassuming player whose wicketkeeping was so tidy as to be invisible. Colin Cowdrey was an outstanding slip fielder who had held 113 catches by 1970, a record by a non-wicketkeeper in Tests at the time. He was joined in the slips by John Edrich, though he was a specialist gully fielder. Batsmen were sometimes lulled by Basil d'Oliveira's slowness in the outfield, but he had a very strong throwing arm and could hit the stumps like a bullet. Geoff Boycott had once been an indifferent outfielder, but worked hard on his game and was now able to throw the ball strongly with either arm. The ever-mercurial John Snow often lounged around the outfield - ignoring the game if he felt it wasn't going anywhere - but had a fine throwing arm when he wanted to use it. The late arrival Bob Willis was an excellent slip and close fielder.\nFirst Test - Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test - Perth.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nThird Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nFirst One Day International - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test - Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nSixth Test - Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\"\nSeventh Test - Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1970-71 Ashes series\""

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1974–75",
        "text": "Mike Denness captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1974–75, playing as England in the 1974-75 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They lost the Test series and the Ashes 4–1 thanks to the battering they received from the fast bowling of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, but won the One Day International and with Lillee and Thomson injured they came back to win the Sixth Test by an innings.\nThe Manager.\nEngland was untried as a consistent winning combination away from home. Their captain had been questioned both as a Test player and leader. Their batting was shallow in specialists and their fast bowling smacked of insurance policies and endeavour rather than hostility. But the touring party was one that demanded respect. There were no fewer than ten members who had previously played against Australian under Australian conditions. Two other players had proved themselves against the old foe in England. It was a professional side, professionally chosen, with a professional knowledge of the gaps that existed in the make-up of the Australian side. It seemed they would give a professional account of themselves.\nAlec Bedser had toured Australia in the 1946-47, 1950-51 and 1954-55 Ashes series as a player, 1958-59 as a journalist and 1962-63 as the assistant-manager, so was well known down under and very knowledgeable about Australian conditions. He was one of the great servants of English cricket and took a record 236 Test wickets at an average of 24.89 despite carrying England's bowling attack against the powerful Australian teams of the post-war era. Bedser was made an England selector in 1962 and Chairman of Selectors in 1969, a post he held until 1981. As a bowler he had been willing to toil all day if his captain demanded and saw team spirit and dedication as qualities needed by any England player, which led to problems with his two best players, Geoff Boycott and John Snow, who he did not see as team players.\nGeoff Boycott was a dedicated if charmless opening batsman who had made 657 runs (93.85) in the 1970-71 Ashes series, but was an awkward tourist who had argued with the Australian umpires. He was named in the touring squad, but was unhappy that he had been dropped for most of the summer and believed that he should have been made England captain instead of Denness. As a result, he announced that he was unavailable for personal reasons and remained in self-imposed exile until 1977. The press speculated on his loss of form, the need to organise his 1975 Benefit Year and a fear of Dennis Lillee, though the Australian fast bowler had not yet returned to cricket after his back injury. Boycott was later accused of cowardice, his many critics saying that he had avoided playing the Australian and West Indian teams of 1974-76 because of their fast bowlers, but no one in the England camp had any idea that Lillee and Thomson would be such a threat until the First Test. Illingworth later said that Boycott was the only England batsmen with the technique to face Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson and it was generally agreed that his loss was a blow to the touring team's chances.\nJohn Snow was a mercurial fast bowler whose short-pitched fast bowling had taken 31 wickets (22.83) in 1970-71 and had knocked out Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner, leading to trouble with the Australian umpires over intimidatory bowling. Crowd demonstrations in the Seventh Test after Jenner was struck on the head led to Ray Illingworth leading the England team off the field. Boycott and Snow were both disciplined on their return from Australia and Snow wrote \"that the selectors would have to be shot before I made a Test comeback\". Mike Denness expressly asked for Snow to tour the West Indies in 1973-74, where he had taken 27 wickets (18.66) in 1967-68, but Bedser over-ruled him because Snow \"was not a good team man\". Denness asked for Snow again in 1974, but when \"Alec accepted the managership in Australia Snow’s chances flew out the window\". Snow was recalled to play Australia at home in the 1975 Ashes series, where he took more wickets than any other England bowler.\nThe Captain.\nThe pace of Thomson and the deadly accuracy and cunning of Lillee unnerved England and I honestly don't believe that Mike Denness had sufficient status and experience as a player and captain to help his batsmen get over what were deep psychological wounds, particularly as he himself was having such a wretched time of it with the bat.\nMichael Henry Denness was the leader of the 1974-75 touring team and the first Scottish-born captain of the England cricket team (Douglas Jardine was born in India of Scottish parents). The late 1960s and early 1970s had seen a split in the ranks of English cricket as the nature of the captaincy. The conservatives saw cricket as uniting the Commonwealth with sportsmanship and social skills as important as cricketing ability and preferred the old style amateur captains with public school backgrounds. In the 1960s they had supported the avuncular Colin Cowdrey, but he was a naturally cautious captain whose stints as England captain were broken by ill-timed injuries. The reformers called for tough, professional captains dedicated to winning Test matches, such as Brian Close and Ray Illingworth, who succeeded Cowdrey in 1969 when he damaged his Achilles heel. Illingworth's success as captain gave England 27 consecutive Tests without defeat, including regaining the Ashes in 1970-71 and retaining them in 1972. However, Illingworth could only maintain his place as long as he was winning and he was sacked minutes after losing to the West Indies by an innings and 226 runs in 1973. Mike Denness had succeeded Cowdrey as the captain of Kent and was the surprise choice to lead England to the West Indies in 1973-74, though he had been Tony Lewis's vice-captain in India in 1972-73. Denness was seen a compromise candidate as he was a university graduate and a professional cricketer, though he was not a regular England player. Others pressed for the return of Cowdrey, Close or Illingworth. Boycott thought he should have the job and proved highly critical of Denness's captaincy. The Scot made a good start in the West Indies by drawing the series 1-1 and dealing diplomatically with the problems arising in the Caribbean in the wake of the exclusion of South Africa from Test cricket, though the press found him a bit dour. In 1974 he did even better, beating India 3-0 while making 289 runs (96.33), though Boycott opined that a donkey could have led the team to victory. He therefore went to Australia with some degree of confidence, but soon things went wrong. He picked up a mystery virus which prevented him from playing and affected his form. Though a natural player of spin he was soon found to have a weakness against the Australian fast bowlers and suffered in the Tests, so that he became the first Test captain to drop himself for bad form, for the Fourth Test at Sydney. Denness received a measure of public support for this decision, although he also wryly told of one letter which was simply addressed to \"Mike Denness, Cricketer\". \"If this letter reaches you,\" it said, \"the Post Office think more of you than I do\". He returned for Fifth Test in Adelaide after an injury to John Edrich and did slightly better, top-scoring in the first innings with 51. Ironically, in the Sixth Test, also at Sydney, when Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were unfit to play, Denness made 188 - the highest Test score by an England captain in Australia - and won by an innings. He beat New Zealand with a batting average of 240.00 and retained the captaincy for the 1975 Cricket World Cup, where England lost to Australia in the semi-finals. He lost the First Test of the 1975 Ashes series by an innings and was replaced by the combative Tony Greig, never to play Test cricket again.\nBatting.\nIt came as a severe shock to the nervous system of the England batsmen when Australia suddenly produced the twin terrors Lillee and Thomson...and my heart went out to the England batsmen. I think the technique of several of the England batsmen left a lot to be desired, but all the coaching and textbook reading in the world could not have prepared them for the sort of short-pitched deliveries that kicked head high and at something like 100 mph.\nThe England batsmen had gorged themselves on the Indian spin bowling in the summer of 1974; David Lloyd averaged 260.00, Keith Fletcher 189.00, John Edrich 101.50, Mike Denness 96.33, Dennis Amiss 92.50 and Tony Greig 79.50. They did well in the rain-affected series against Pakistan and were chosen en masse for the tour of Australia, along with Geoff Boycott who had missed most of the summer due to poor form. Boycott declined to tour and was replaced by Brian Luckhurst, a Kent opener who had made 455 runs (56.87) in 1970-71 and two centuries despite badly bruised fingers None of these had any great experience in facing fast bowling, which had been in short supply in the last few years of Test cricket. This was not seen as a problem as Australian pitches were usually good for batting or spin and while Dennis Lillee had recovered from his back injury he was not seen as a problem. The pipe-smoking Dennis Amiss was a heavy run-maker for Warwickshire who had once carried his bat for 262 out of 432 against the West Indies in 1973-74, but was bounced out of cricket by the Australian and West Indian fast bowlers of the mid-1970s. He returned with a square on stance to make 203 against Michael Holding at the Oval in 1976. David Lloyd made 214 not out against India in his second Test, but failed to make another 50 in Tests and never played after this tour. In 1965 John Edrich made a record 310 not out New Zealand in the Third Test at Headingley with a record 52 fours and 5 sixes, but was hit on the head by a Peter Pollock bouncer in his next Test, forcing him to retire hurt and thereafter he had a distaste for fast bowling. He changed into a solid and unspectacular accumulator of runs and in the 1970-71 Ashes series he batted for a record 33 hours and 26 minutes making 648 runs (72.00) and two centuries. Keith Fletcher had a promising career, but like most of the England batsmen was a player of spin with limited technique against real pace and suffered as a result, but came back to make 146 in the Sixth Test and later became a successful captain of Essex. Colin Cowdrey was the first man to have played in a hundred Tests and was asked to reinforce the England squad after the injuries suffered in the First Test. This was his record sixth tour of Australia and he played in the Second Test in Perth just two days after arriving from England. The 6'7\" South African born Tony Greig was England's best batsman of the tour, using his height to slash the fast bowlers over the slips and having the advantage of batting at number 6 after the earlier batsmen had faced the brunt of the bowling. The wicketkeeper Alan Knott who came in at number 7 was the next best batsmen, a perky, Punch-like character with a sound defence and some unorthodox shots. Fred Titmus had had great success with the bat on his previous tours in 1962-63 and 1965-66 and had a Test average of 48.89 in Australia. Chris Old was once liken to Ian Botham in his ability as an all-rounder and made six first class centuries.\nBowling.\nIt was impossible to recall when the initial selection of an England touring party to Australia had included five out-and-out quick bowlers. Perhaps Lever's experience was intended to underwrite the hard-wicket fallibility of his fellow fast bowling quartet, who had not enjoyed a successful tour in the West Indies...The fact that the England selectors placed all their trump cards in the fast bowling had, also dangerously weakened the batting make-up of the touring party.\nWithout John Snow England depended on the injury-prone Bob Willis to spearhead their fast bowling. Though his chest on action could generate real pace his knees could not take the strain and after bouncing the Australians in the First Test he was reduced to fast-medium pace. In support he had a host of quality fast-medium bowlers; Geoff Arnold, Mike Hendrick, Chris Old and Peter Lever who were able to exploit the seaming pitches and heavy atmosphere in England, but who suffered on the flat, dry pitches in Australia. Arnold shared the new ball with John Snow. but a series of injuries and Snow's fall from grace prevented what could have been a productive partnership, in 1974 he and Old dismissed India for 42. Old was 6'3\" Yorkshireman who suffered from a long list of injuries and niggles and so rarely fulfilled his great promise. Hendrick was a gloomy looking bowler who always seemed to beat the bat without success and holds the record for taking the most Test wickets without having captured 5 in a single innings. Lever had toured Australia in 1970-71 without great success, but in this series took his best Test figures of 6/38 in the Sixth Test at Sydney. In the following tour of New Zealand he hit the tailender Ewen Chatfield on the head with a bouncer and almost killed him, Chatworth was saved by cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the team physiotherapist Bernie Thomas and a distraught Lever had to be helped off the field. Before the arrival of Ian Botham the 6'7\" Tony Greig was the Golden Boy of English cricket and has the lowest bowling average of any man who averages over 40 with the bat in Tests. Initially he was a medium paced bowler whose great height produced awkward bounce, but in 1973-74 he switched to off-spin and took 13/156 to win the Fifth Test and square the series. Fred Titmus was a veteran off spin bowler who in 1974 become the fourth man after W.G. Grace, Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst to take 2,500 wickets and make 20,000 runs in first class cricket, and \"if accolades like that don't make a bloke feel old, then I don't know what does!\" He had made his debut in 1947 and thought his selection was a joke, but Alec Bedser told him \"our cupboard is pretty bare when it comes to young players\". The Cockney took his best Test figures of 7/79 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1962-63 with his flighted off-spinners, but had lost four toes in a boating accident in 1968 and had not played in Tests since. Derek Underwood was a first class bowler from his teens who bowled immaculate slow-medium spinners and used to say that bowling was a \"low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake” as sooner or later every batsmen would make a mistake. On damp English wickets he earned the nickname \"Deadly\" for his ability to make the ball leap and turn, as when he took 10/82 against Australia at Headingley in 1972 and 13/71 against Pakistan at Lord's in 1974.\nFielding.\nAlan Knott had been chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1970 and was regarded as the finest keeper in the world. In this series he dismissed 24 Australian batsmen, a new Test record and Rod Marsh admitted that he learned much of his trade from watching \"Knotty\" in the 1970-71 series. Knott continually exercised before play and between balls and was a highly entertaining player whose partnership with his teammate Derek Underwood was legendary. Others thought that the reserve keeper Bob Taylor was even better, a quiet, unassuming player whose wicketkeeping was so tidy as to be invisible. Colin Cowdrey was an outstanding slip fielder whose 120 Test catches was a record by a fieldsman at the time. He was joined in the slips by John Edrich, though he was a specialist gully fielder. Tony Greig and Bob Willis was an excellent slip and close fielders, while Mike Denness \"was by repute...the best fieldsman in his own side\".\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Perth.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\"\nFirst One Day International - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\"\nSixth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1974-75 Ashes series\""

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1975",
        "text": "Following the 1975 Cricket World Cup, the Australian cricket team remained in England in the 1975 season to play a four-match Test series against England.\nFor England, the principal resistance came from veteran opening batsman John Edrich and David Steele, who received a maiden international cap after a decade of county cricket for Northants and whose silver-haired, bespectacled appearance led the press to dub him \"the bank clerk who went to war\". Steele went on to be named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 1975, the first cricketer to win the accolade since Jim Laker in 1956. Nonetheless, in the absence of Geoffrey Boycott, the batting was again broadly unable to withstand the pace-bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, with swing bowler Max Walker providing admirable support; the trio shared 51 wickets in the four Tests. The tour was Ian Chappell's last as captain; he met with considerable success with the bat, compiling Australia's highest aggregate, but announced his retirement from the captaincy following the final Test.\nAustralia won the series 1–0 with three matches drawn. Australia therefore retained The Ashes.\nSeries summary.\nFirst Test.\nIn overcast conditions, England captain Mike Denness asked Australia to bat; Rick McCosker (59) and debutant Alan Turner (37) added 80 for the first wicket, and further contributions from Ian Chappell (52), Ross Edwards (56), Rod Marsh (61) and Jeff Thomson (49) enabled Australia to total 359. Shortly after the commencement of England's reply, a thunderstorm produced treacherous batting conditions; devastating spells from Dennis Lillee and Max Walker reduced England to 83/7 at the end of the second day and 101 all out the following morning, John Edrich (34) providing the only resistance. The pace of Jeff Thomson accounted for England's second innings demise, bowled out for 173 to hand Australia an innings victory, Keith Fletcher (51) top-scoring for England. Graham Gooch, on Test debut, scored a pair. England captain Denness scored 3 and 8, and was dropped from the side before the second Test, to be replaced as captain by Tony Greig.\nSecond Test.\nDennis Lillee's four-wicket opening spell reduced England to 49/4 before David Steele (50), on debut, bailed England out. Steele set a platform for more positive contributions from new England captain Tony Greig (96) and Alan Knott (69), with Bob Woolmer (33), also on debut, shoring up the tail. In reply, John Snow reduced Australia to 37/3 and 81/7, but Ross Edwards (99) was well supported by the tail, especially Lillee (73 not out, with three sixes). John Edrich (175) anchored England's second innings, sharing partnerships of 111 for the first wicket with Barry Wood (52), 104 for the second with Steele (45), 66 for the fourth with Graham Gooch (31). Sedate at first, Edrich hit out as a declaration neared, adding 65 for the fifth with Greig (41 from 42 balls), before a hard-hitting cameo from Woolmer (31 from 25 balls, with two sixes) heralded Greig's declaration. Thanks to Rick McCosker (79), Ian Chappell (86), Greg Chappell (73 not out) and Edwards (52 not out), Australia did not struggle to salvage a draw, losing only three wickets in one-and-a-half days.\nThird Test.\nJohn Edrich (62) and David Steele (73) added 112 for England's second wicket, and Tony Greig contributed 51, but following Greig's run-out, England's last five wickets fell for 20 runs, the last four all to Gary Gilmour, as England were bowled out for 288. In reply, left-arm spinner Phil Edmonds, on debut, claimed 5/28 as Australia collapsed to 135 all out. With typical stoicism, Steele (92) anchored England's second innings. Chasing a target of 445, contributions from Rick McCosker (95 not out) and Ian Chappell (62) led Australia to 220/3 at the close of the fourth day; with the match thus poised and McCosker set to make a maiden Test century, overnight pitch vandalism (carried out by supporters alleging the wrongful conviction of George Davis) ensured that no play was possible on the final day. A potentially exciting finish was ruined although heavy rain fell in the afternoon meaning the match would likely have ended in a draw anyway.\nFourth Test.\nRick McCosker (127, his maiden Test century) and Ian Chappell (192) took Australia to 280/1 at the end of the first day, setting up a total of 532/9. In reply, Barry Wood (30), John Edrich (12 from 98 balls) and David Steele (39 from 106 balls) painstakingly defied the Australians as England reached 78/1, but following the dismissals of Wood and Edrich, Jeff Thomson and Max Walker combined to reduce England to 147/8; only the tail-end efforts of Chris Old (25 not out) and John Snow (30) enabled England to reach an eventual total of 191 all out. Chappell asked England to follow on; with two-and-a-half days of a six-day Test remaining, defeat seemed almost inevitable. Still further resistance from Edrich (96) and Steele (66) saw England close the fourth day on 179/1; after Lillee dismissed both in quick succession the following morning, England continued to resist. Bob Woolmer (149, his maiden Test century) defied Australia for more than eight hours, sharing partnerships of 122 with Graham Roope (77) and 151 with Alan Knott (64) as England held out for 14 hours to reach 522/5. Only a spell of medium pace from Doug Walters eventually conquered England's lower order. In the limited remaining time, Australia reached 40/2. Chappell announced his retirement from the captaincy at the end of the match."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1977",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured England in the 1977 season to play five Test matches for the 1977 Ashes series against England. The Australians also played three one day internationals and 19 other tour matches.\nThe Australian side had been quite strong in the early 1970s and had won the previous two Ashes series, 1974–75 at home and 1975 in England. Although it was not a contest for The Ashes, Australia and England had also played in the Centenary Test from 15 to 19 March 1977 to mark the 100th anniversary of the first Test match. Remarkably Australia won by the same margin as in 1877, 45 runs. However the tourists, led by new captain Greg Chappell, were rocked prior to the start of the 1977 Ashes series by the conflict between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer's Nine Network that emerged following the Centenary Test regarding the rights to television broadcasts of cricket in Australia. Packer wanted to transfer the rights to televised cricket from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) who had held the rights since 1956, to his own Nine Network and was prepared to pay a much larger amount than ABC. Despite this, the Australian Cricket Board refused, and Packer set about creating a rebel World Series Cricket (WSC) league, successfully recruiting many star international players in the process.\nEventually all but two of the squad would take part in WSC, the exceptions being Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant. England were also affected, but not as badly. The English captain Tony Greig was stood down from the captaincy as punishment, but retained his place in the side. Mike Brearley replaced Greig as England captain. Despite reasonable returns the inexperienced Australians were outplayed, and England won the series 3–0 with two matches drawn. England therefore regained The Ashes for the first time since 1972.\nAustralian touring party.\nThe Australian touring squad was selected by Neil Harvey, Phil Ridings and Sam Loxton. It consisted of:\nDennis Lillee was unavailable for selection due to injury. Former Test regulars Alan Turner and Gary Gilmour were controversially overlooked due to poor form in the 1976–77 summer.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nEngland won the Prudential Trophy 2–1.\nOther tour matches.\nAustralians (186/5) beat the Duchess of Norfolk's XI (166 all out) by 20 runs\nAustralia began their 1977 tour of England with the traditional warm-up game against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel Castle Cricket Ground. The match was a 45-over limited overs cricket match, and Australian captain Greg Chappell won the toss and elected to bat. Although not scoring at a particularly fast rate, a solid second wicket partnership of 101 between Chappell (44) and Craig Serjeant (65) was the backbone of a well made 186 for 5. Indian-born Bob Woolmer, who would later play a part in the Test series, was the best of the bowlers with 3 for 17 off seven overs.\nThe Duchess of Norfolk's XI lost their first wicket in the second over, that of opener John Barclay caught and bowled by Mick Malone for 7. However a 40-run partnership between Bob Woolmer and Peter Willey, and a 44-run partnership between Derek Randall (41), and Willey who made 50, steadied the ship. But the Australian bowlers lacked the penetration of the usual opening bowling partnership of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, who had caused so much discomfort on the previous tour. Despite this, once the partnership of Willey and Randell was broken, wickets began to fall at regular intervals, the only other notable contributions being 14 from Tony Greig and 15 from Phil Edmonds. Gary Cosier was the pick of the Australian bowlers with 4 for 18 off 6.3 overs. The Duchess of Norfolk's XI were all out for 166 off 41.3 overs, with Australia winning by 20 runs.\nMatch Drawn\nSurrey captain John Edrich won the toss and decided to bat first. Openers Edrich, and Alan Butcher got off to a solid start, taking them to 48 for the first wicket. Their partnership was broken when Butcher was caught behind by Rod Marsh off the bowling of Len Pascoe for 23. Lonsdale Skinner contributed 17, but then Edrich was joined by Pakistan Test batsman Younis Ahmed, and the pair added 66 for the third wicket. Their stand was broken by the medium bowling of Max Walker who had Ahmed caught by Kim Hughes for 40, and dismissed Edrich caught behind for 70 soon after. Walker then dismissed David Smith for a duck, and at 165 for 5 the tourists were in a commanding position. New batsman Graham Roope had other ideas though, and was in commanding form. He formed lower order partnerships with Intikhab Alam (16), Robin Jackman (16), and Geoff Arnold (11) who all supported him ably as he made his way to 107 not out, guiding Surrey to a respectable 327 for 8. Not for the first time in the match, play was abandoned early on the second day due to rain, and no play occurred on the third day, with the match ending in a draw.\nMatch Drawn\nAfter the disappointing rain-affected match at the Oval, the Australians headed to the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury to take on Kent in a 3-day game. The Australians won the toss and batted first. The tourists' innings could not have got off to a worse start, with opener Ian Davis clean bowled by Kevin Jarvis for a first ball duck. The innings recovered though, with Craig Serjeant and Kim Hughes adding 79 for the second wicket, but once Serjeant had been removed for 55, Gary Cosier followed him next over without adding to the score, leaving Australia on 79 for 3. The tourists ended day one on 119 for 3. Solid but unimpressive middle order efforts followed from Doug Walters (23), Richie Robinson (18), and Rod Marsh (23) dragged Australia past 200, but with the weather again threatening to disrupt play, and wanting some bowling practice, the Australians declared on 240 for 7, Ray Bright not out on 11, and Max Walker not out on 16. Jeff Thomson made his first appearance for the tourists, opening the bowling from the Pavilion End. However it was first change bowler Ray Bright who got the breakthrough, having Graham Johnson caught behind by Marsh for 17. Charles Rowe went for a duck next over off the bowling of Mick Malone, but rain soon interrupted play, and the rest of day two was washed out. The rain had set in, and no additional play was managed on day three, with the second game in a row ending in a draw.\nMatch Drawn\nThe Australian tourists moved on to Hove the next day after the draw against Kent, but the poor weather continued there. Australian captain Greg Chappell won the toss, and decided his side needed more batting practice with the one-day series and Tests approaching. Very little play was possible on the first day as a result of the heavy rain, with the Australians managing to reach just 35 for 1 at the end of the day.\nDay two proved to be little better, and although opener Craig Serjeant managed to pass fifty, on his way to 55 not out, the game was called off after 34 overs, with the third day abandoned.\nMatch Abandoned\nThe Australian schedule would have seen them play three games in row, without any rest days in between. However the weather conspired to prevent this occurrence, and the Australians travelled from Hove to Southampton to discover the foul weather was even worse there. The tourists arrived at the ground, but after a pitch inspection was made by the umpires, the game was abandoned without a ball bowled. No coin toss was made either.\nMatch Drawn\nFollowing the abandonment of the two previous games, the Australian touring party were keen to get some match practice, with the two international series rapidly approaching. They travelled from Southampton onto Swansea, in Wales to take on Glamorgan in another three-day game. The first day was again washed out, but the rain had cleared by the morning of the second. With the weather finally favouring play after a long week of rain, Glamorgan captain Alan Jones won the toss, and confidently decided to bat first. The captain opened alongside John Hopkins, and the pair began aggressively, but Max Walker had Hopkins clean bowled in the fifth over. From there, Jones batted with a steady procession of partners, holding up the innings by himself as wickets continued to fall at the other end at regular intervals. Only the captain's namesake Alan Lewis Jones made a serious contribution with 46. Jones (captain and opener) was top-scorer with 59. Shortly before lunch Glamorgan were all out for 172 off 54.3 overs. Walker and Geoff Dymock sharing the spoils with three wickets apiece.\nThe Australians still looked rusty, having spent most of the tour so far hiding from the rain in the dressing room. They too failed to settle and build partnerships, with regular wickets falling. By the end of day two, the Australian tourists found themselves 153 for 6 after 36 overs, with only Gary Cosier making a serious contribution of 56.\nDay three began with the weather again threatening, and Chappell declared the Australian innings closed without returning to the crease to try to make a game of it. However Glamorgan openers Jones and Hopkins made much better work of it the second time around, pushing the score past 100 without loss. With Australia's frontline bowlers struggling to make a breakthrough, spinner Ray Bright was brought on, and made an immediate impact, having the advancing Hopkins stumped brilliantly by replacement wicket-keeper Richie Robinson for 66. Bright troubled the Glamorgan batsmen with his left-arm orthodox spinners, and soon claimed another, Arthur Francis for 2, leaving Glamorgan on 119–2. Gwyn Richards arrived as his replacement and tried to lift the scoring, but Bright soon claimed Jones for 47, and Mike Llewellyn for 9. Glamorgan had reached 164 for 4 off 43 overs and decided to end their innings and give the Australian's a competitive target. Bright finished with 4 for 53.\nThe Australians began their chase of the target of 183 disastrously. Veteran bowler Malcolm Nash had opener Richie Robinson lbw for a second ball duck, and had Kim Hughes caught behind two balls later for a golden duck. Australia ended the first over on 2 for 0. Ian Davis and David Hookes tried to rebuild their innings, but both had also soon departed. Doug Walters also went cheaply, and it was left to spinners Ray Bright and Kerry O'Keeffe to offer the only resistance, putting on a partnership of over 40. The only highlight in an otherwise disastrous innings was Bright bringing up his 1000th first-class run. Australia survived a torrid attack from Nash to reach stumps on 86 for 6 off 29 overs, Nash claiming 5 for 32.\nSomerset (340/5d &amp; 182/3) beat the Australians (232 all out &amp; 289 all out) by 7 wickets\nThe Australians moved on to Bath to take on Somerset, and the weather finally began to look favourable. Australia won the toss and decided to bat on a decent batting wicket. Rick McCosker went cheaply and was soon followed by Craig Serjeant, but captain Greg Chappell looked to be in commanding touch. He set about building a strong partnership with Gary Cosier, which saw the tourists pass 150 for 2. Soon after though, Cosier misread a straight one on off-stump from West Indian paceman Joel Garner, and was clean-bowled for 44. Doug Walters made a useful but disappointing 23, but David Hookes and Rod Marsh both failed with 3 apiece. Kerry O'Keeffe added a useful 11 to help see Australia past 200, but a collapsing tail saw Australia all out for 232 off 67.3 overs, with Chappell top-scorer with 113. The Australian captain hit three 6s in his innings, including one into the nearby River Avon. Garner finished with 4 for 66, but local medium-pacer Graham Burgess was the pick of the bowlers with 5 for 25.\nIn contrast to the Australians poor start, the Somerset openers eased past 50, before Peter Denning was caught behind off Geoff Dymock for 39. Viv Richards surprisingly could only manage 18, and Somerset captain Brian Close was removed for a duck. Somerset finishing day one on 130 for 3.\nDay two began well for the Australians, with O'Keffee removing Dennis Breakwell for 23, however strong innings by Ian Botham (59) and Phil Slocombe (55) supported opener Brian Rose to 110 not out. Somerset declared their innings closed at 340 for 5 off 94 overs, a lead of 108.\nAustralia (154 all out &amp; 251 all out) beat Gloucestershire (63 all out &amp; 169 all out) by 173 runs\nAustralia moved on to Bristol looking for their first win since the opening match of the tour against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI. With only three tour matches to go before the start of the One day international series, the tourists were hoping to build some momentum going into those matches. Greg Chappell won the toss, and elected to bat first, but the Australia innings was poor. McCosker fell for 2 with the score on 3. Kim Hughes fell a few overs last for 7. The wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals, with the only real resistance coming from Doug Walters (32), and Ray Bright (53). The Australians were all out for 154 in 47.5 overs.\nThankfully for the tourists, Gloucestershire were even poorer. After an opening stand of 36 from Sadiq Mohammad and Andy Stovold, Max Walker and Mick Malone made short work of their batting line-up. It took the Australian opening pair just 22.5 overs to have Gloucestershire all out for a paltry 63. Walker took an impressive 7/19 off 11.5, and Malone, 3/43 off 11 overs.\nAustralia again started with a wobble, losing McCosker for 4 in the third over, but a 42 run partnership between Chappell and Ian Davis got them back on track. Davis eventually went for 18, but that brought Kim Hughes to the crease. Although scoring less prolifically, Hughes capably supported Chappell as he moved towards a well-deserved century, falling on 102. It was enough to prop up the Australian second innings, and solid contributions from Hughes (27), Doug Walters (24), Richie Robinson (26), and Max Walker (22) took Australia to 251 all out. Gloucestershire required an unlikely 343 for victory, and never looked like they would reach the target. Andy Stovold made 27, and Jim Foat and David Shepherd both chipped in with 26 each, but Gloucentershire were all out for 169. Len Pascoe (4/36) and Ray Bright (4/63) were the pick of the Australian bowlers, as they wrapped up a deserved victory by 173 runs in two days.\nAustralia (196/4) beat Gloucestershire (195 all out) by 6 wickets\nOwing to the completion of their tour match in two days instead of the scheduled three, an additional 45-overs a side match was agreed to be played. No toss was made, but Gloucestershire batted first by a Gentlemen's agreement. The County side again struggled with the tourist's bowling, Pascoe clean-bowling Mohammed for 4, and dismissing Zaheer Abbas for 5. Stovold made a solid 25, and Mike Procter made a well-deserved 52. Pascoe, Malone, Walker, O'Keefe and Bright all took two wickets each in what was a good workout for Australia's bowling attack, and their County hosts only managed to scramble to 195 all out off 44.5 overs.\nThe total never looked like enough, and with the first one-day international only eight days away, the Australians took the opportunity to play themselves into a bit of form. Davis and McCosker again made solid starts, scoring 26 and 46 respectively, but it was Kim Hughes (51), and Doug Walters (52 not out) that took the game away from Gloucestershire. Hughes fell as the target approached, but Rod Marsh came in with only four runs required for victory, and over eight overs still spare. Only Robinson out for 10, really disappointed, as Australia won comfortably by 6 wickets."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1982–83",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured Australia during the 1982–83 season, playing a five-Test series for The Ashes and a number of tour matches against Australian domestic teams before competing in a One-Day International (ODI) series against New Zealand for the Rothmans Cup. In between those competitions, England also participated in the Benson &amp; Hedges World Series Cricket triangular ODI series against Australia and New Zealand.\nBackground.\nThe 1982/83 series, sponsored by Benson &amp; Hedges and celebrating the centenary of the Ashes, was the first to be held in Australia following the rapprochement between the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket franchise. There had been a test series organized between Australia and England during the 1979–80 season, but this was part of a \"triangular\" test series that also involved the West Indies, and so the Ashes were not being contested.\nIt had also been 18 months since the memorable 1981 Ashes series, which England had won 3–1 thanks to the heroics of several players, chief among them Ian Botham. In the lead-up to the 1982/83 series, the Nine Network, which had won exclusive rights to broadcast cricket on Australia television for ten years following World Series Cricket, ran an advertising campaign drawing on national stereotypes and aimed to inspire patriotism and an appetite for revenge.\nEngland squad.\nThe England selectors announced their squad on 11 September which flew out to Australia on 13 October. Doug Insole was appointed Tour Manager, with Norman Gifford as his assistant, while Warwickshire physiotherapist Bernard Thomas joined the squad for his eleventh successive tour. Veteran pace bowler Bob Willis was appointed captain. The squad was weakened by the absence of a number of players from the previous Ashes series who had become ineligible for selection; Graham Gooch, Geoff Boycott, John Emburey, Mike Hendrick, Alan Knott, Wayne Larkins, Chris Old, Peter Willey and Bob Woolmer were serving three-year bans from international cricket due to their participation in the rebel tour to South Africa. Somewhat more controversial was the omission of available players like Mike Gatting, Trevor Jesty, Graham Dilley and Phil Edmonds; Gatting and Edmonds had played pivotal roles in Middlesex' county championship success, Gatting scoring over 1600 runs at an average of nearly 59, as well as contributing 21 wickets, and Edmonds taking 80 wickets. With three off-spinners selected in the squad (Hemmings, Marks and Miller), his left-arm orthodox spin would have provided much-needed variety. To bolster their pace stocks, the selectors sprang a surprise by including 21-year-old Jamaican-born Norman Cowans.\nThe Ashes series.\nFirst Test.\nDay one.\nIn hot and dry conditions (Perth was in the middle of a heatwave), Greg Chappell won the toss and elected to field, meaning that in all five Ashes tests played at the WACA to date, the toss-winning captain had sent the opposition in to bat first. The Australians made an early breakthrough when Dennis Lillee dismissed Geoff Cook for 1 with a short ball the Northamptonshire opener fended off his ribs to John Dyson at forward short leg with England's score on 14. Vice-captain David Gower was next in and ensured with Chris Tavaré that no further wickets were lost, going into lunch with the score on 66.\nIn the middle session, Gower began to find his rhythm while Tavaré, who survived two dropped catches, continued to frustrate the Australians with dour defence. Lillee, whose cantankerous nature had in recent years become more difficult to control, had already been involved in a number of concerning incidents. After a leg-before appeal against Gower was rejected, he beat a fist into the ground, then following the next delivery which Gower played back up the pitch, Lillee kicked the ball angrily towards the slips. The second-wicket partnership had yielded 95 runs when Gower, shortly after hitting his ninth four, was caught superbly off Terry Alderman by Dyson at backward square leg; Gower's innings of 72 in only 143 minutes was considered the highlight of the day's play. Allan Lamb struggled early and was lucky to survive after nearly playing a delivery from Bruce Yardley onto his leg stump. When tea was called, England were 140 for two from 57 overs.\nThere was tension and controversy in the final session, beginning when Lillee was again denied a wicket, appealing for a caught behind against Lamb. After some angry looks and muttering, Lillee snatched his sun hat from umpire Tony Crafter at the end of the over; this same umpire had come between Lillee and Pakistani batsman Javed Miandad in an incident during the previous year's Perth test. Tavaré again let his partner take the initiative to push the score along, with Lamb now striking some hefty blows. The pair added 80 for the third wicket before Lamb, having just hit Yardley for a straight six against the sightscreen, edged a ball in the same over onto his thigh and wicketkeeper Rod Marsh was able to dive forward and take the rebound. Lamb had scored 46 in 109 minutes which included five fours in addition to the aforementioned six. Ian Botham, Australia's nemesis from the previous series, strode to the crease and attacked from the outset, scoring 12 off six balls when, in the last ball of a Geoff Lawson over, Botham played forward and appeared beaten by an in-swinger. As wicketkeeper Marsh came forward to take a low catch, Lawson appealed to umpire Crafter for a catch but was rejected. After Lawson had collected his sun hat at the end of the over, he appealed to square leg umpire Mel Johnson, who confirmed to his colleague that the ball had carried. Crafter reversed his decision and gave Botham out. Botham, to his credit, walked immediately even though he had indicated to the umpires that the ball had struck his pad rather than the edge of the bat, and television replays suggested this was the case. it was now Derek Randall's turn to join Tavaré in the middle for the final hour of play, and struggled to settle, playing and missing outside his off stump. Lillee took the second new ball with 15 minutes remaining, but was unable to break through.&lt;br&gt; At stumps England were 242 for four, with Tavaré on 66 and Randall on 32. Remarkably, Tavaré had not added to his score in the last 71 minutes of the day's play.\nDay two.\nThe second day's play was marred by spiteful clashes between Australian and English fans, which spilled onto the field and claimed Terry Alderman as an unfortunate victim.\nOne Day Internationals in New Zealand.\nNew Zealand won the Rothmans Cup 3–0."

However, there were some encouraging signs, such as the consistent form of Kepler Wessels, the re-emergence of Andrew Hilditch as a test batsman, the discovery of an exciting new pace prospect in Craig McDermott and improved spin bowling stocks, led by Bob Holland.\nOriginal squad.\nThe original squad selected were as follows:\n\"Rebel tours\" of South Africa.\nHowever it was revealed prior to leaving for England that several of the cricketers had signed to play cricket in South Africa over the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons, including Alderman, Wellham, Wood, McCurdy, Phillips, Bennett and Rixon. Although these contracts did not start until after the Ashes, the Australian Cricket Board were reluctant to allow these players to go on the tour.\nWellham, Phillips and Wood were then all offered inducements by Kerry Packer, who owned TV rights to the game, not to go to South Africa, and Bennett changed his mind. Alderman, McCurdy and Rixon stuck by their original decisions, and were ruled ineligible to tour. They were replaced by Carl Rackemann, John Maguire and Ray Phillips. Rackemann and McGuire then revealed that they too had signed to tour South Africa, and were replaced by David Gilbert and Jeff Thomson.\nThe remaining Australian team originally elected to tour without Wellham, Phillips and Wood but eventually changed their mind after a team meeting.\nSeries.\nAustralia performed reasonably well in the early tour games, the highlight being Allan Border scoring four centuries in consecutive first class games. Jeff Thomson leapt into test consideration after taking eight wickets against Somerset. David Boon, Greg Ritchie and Wayne Phillips also scored well in early games, and Bob Holland took a number of wickets. Simon O'Donnell's century against the MCC saw him come into consideration as an all rounder.\nAustralia won the one day series 2–1. They then drew a game against Leicestershire in which David Gower scored a century, taking heavy toll off Bob Holland's bowling, while Jeff Thomson took five wickets.\nThis saw Thomson preferred over Holland in Australia's team for the first test. Simon O'Donnell was picked as the fourth bowler in support of McDermott, Lawson and Thomson, despite a noticeable lack of success with the ball on the tour until that date. The rest of the team consisted of Wood, Hilditch, Wessels, Border, Boon, Ritchie and Phillips. Australia lost the first by five wickets.\nHolland then took five wickets in a game against Hampshire and came into the test side in place of Thomson for the second test. Australia won this by four wickets, due mostly to Allan Border's scores of 196 and 41 not out, and five wicket hauls to McDermott and Holland.\nAustralia kept the same side for the third test, which ended in a heavy scoring draw. In order to boost the bowling, the injured Graeme Wood was replaced by all rounder Greg Matthews in the fourth test, where Australia managed to escape with a draw due to a second innings century from Allan Border.\nFor the fifth test Wood returned and Matthews was dropped. However Australia decided to boost the bowling by dropping Boon for Jeff Thomson. Australia lost the game by an innings.\nAustralia dropped O'Donnell for the sixth and final test, bringing in Dirk Wellham instead, and replacing Holland with Murray Bennett and Jeff Thomson with Gilbert. Australia lost this game by an innings as well."

        "title": "Fencing Ireland",
        "text": "Fencing Ireland () – formerly the Irish Fencing Federation (IFF; ) – is the governing body for the sport of fencing in Ireland. It was formally established in 1933, although the sport of fencing has been practised in Ireland since the beginning of the 1900s. The Federation is recognised by Sport Ireland and the Olympic Council of Ireland, and it is also affiliated to the Federation Internationale d'Escrime and European Fencing Confederation.\nName.\nThe organisation was established as the Irish Amateur Fencing Federation (IAFF) in 1933 during a meeting at the Grosvenor Hotel on Westland Row, and remained under that title until 2008 when it was reconstituted as the Irish Fencing Federation; the current trading name was adopted in March 2016, and later became the legal name of the organisation.\nRole.\nFencing Ireland's stated aim is to promote, foster and develop the sport and art of fencing. In practice, its role includes approval of clubs via the affiliation system, management of the domestic competition calendar, certification and development of new coaches and referees, and selection of the national team for international tournaments.\nAs the national governing body, Fencing Ireland also takes responsibility for running two of the largest events in the Irish calendar: the National Championships and the Irish Open. In 2006, the Irish Open was designated an FIE Satellite World Cup for the Men's Épée discipline. The lure of world ranking points has brought some of the biggest names in international fencing to compete in Dublin.\nHistory.\nThe earliest record of fencing as a recreational sport is believed to come from a medal held in the National Museum of Ireland presented by the Earl of Charlemont in July of 1781 to a Sergeant More for swordmanship. \nFencing has been included in the Olympic Games since their modern-day inception in 1896 and the contemporary sport formally came to Ireland ten years later in 1906, when the Irish Fencing Club was founded in Dublin, an early member of the executive committee was Count Markievicz, husband of Constance Markievicz. It was not the first club in Ireland, but it was the first in which the principal aim was exercise and sport rather than duelling. The club closed in 1917 and there is no record of the sport being practised in the following years. \nIt was in 1931 that the sport began its continuous history, when Guy Perrem returned to Ireland having been educated in France where he had learned fencing as part of his studies. He was working at the Guinness brewery in Dublin and was keen to continue with the sport he loved. Not knowing of any other fencers in the country he placed an advertisement in the Irish Times inviting people interested to contact him and along with those who contacted him, Guy formed the Irish Fencing Club. A retired British army instructor living in Dublin at the time was engaged as the resident coach, however he only specialised in sabre. In spite of this membership grew quickly through word of mouth.\nThrough Guy Perrem's association with Guinness the Earl of Iveagh became the patron of Irish Fencing and gave permission to fence in his grounds off Stephen's Green now the site of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Iveagh gardens. In the subsequent two years membership grew significantly to the point where it was necessary to break into a number of clubs to support the introduction of a more competitive spirit.\nIn 1933, members of the Irish Fencing Club hired a function room in the Grosvenor Hotel in Westland Row in Dublin to hold a meeting at which the Irish Fencing Club was formally disbanded in favour of a number of smaller clubs. Among the clubs found were Dublin Fencing Club, the Ierne Fencing Club, Dolphins Fencing club (associated with Dolphin rowing club), Cork County Fencing club and Palestrina Fencing club also in Cork. Following the establishment of the clubs, the Irish Amateur Fencing Federation came into being. \nIn 1935, wishing to provide opportunities for international competition to its members, the IAFF applied for and was granted membership of the Federation d'Escrime Internationale. It has continued as the national governing body of the sport since that time.\nClubs.\nIn the years following the establishment of the federation, clubs were set up at:\nThrough the years the list of clubs has continued to grow steadily. Fencing clubs have been established in most major colleges in Ireland: in addition to Trinity College and UCD, clubs are also thriving at DCU, UCC, NUI Galway, Maynooth University and until recently University of Limerick. With the renewed focus on sport in Ireland's ITs, fencing has also taken off at DKIT, IT Carlow, and fencing has a foothold at IT Tallaght and University of Ulster. The early 21st century has seen an explosion in the number of private clubs appearing around the country, as well as clubs based within schools.\nCompetition.\nIn 1948 Ireland sent its first fencers to the Olympics in London. Tom Smith, Harry Thuillier and Owen Tuohy competed in the individual foil event and were joined by Paddy Duffy for the team event. Foilist Dorothy 'Tommy' Dermody was the first female fencer to represent Ireland at the Olympics."

A 7'0\" center from the University of Connecticut, he played under Hall of Fame head coach Jim Calhoun.\nCareer.\nKnight was drafted with the 29th overall pick in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In July 1996, less than a month after drafting Knight, the Bulls renounced the rights to sign Knight rather than give him the required three-year contract for first-round picks. He then signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nAfter playing in 71 games with the Lakers, which included 14 starts, an appearance in the rookie all-star game and averages of 4.8 points and 4.5 rebounds in 16.3 minutes per game, Knight was once again a free agent and signed a 7-year contract worth $22 million with the Boston Celtics under new coach and general manager Rick Pitino. Upon signing the deal, Knight said, \"I really have mixed emotions; I should be elated right now, but I'm not. I feel so much loyalty [to the Lakers]\". After one season in which he averaged 6.5 points over 71 games with the Celtics, Knight was traded back to the Lakers for Tony Battie. He won a championship as a role player with the Lakers in 2000, averaging 1.6 points per game in 6.3 minutes in 71 games. In September 2000, Knight was sent to the New York Knicks as part of a four-team trade which sent Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics. Knight played his final 3 NBA seasons in New York; he averaged between 5.7 and 9 minutes per game over those seasons and never more than 2 points per game as a bench player. He left the NBA in 2003 when the initial contract he signed in 1996 expired.\nOverall, Knight played in 7 NBA seasons from 1996 to 2003, appeared in 371 games over that time and scored a total of 1,276 points. He holds the NBA Playoff record for quickest disqualification, having fouled out in six minutes in game 4 of the 1999 Western Conference semi-finals.\nPersonal life.\nKnight is married to April Cowgill.

        "title": "Tuck rule (American football)",
        "text": "The tuck rule was a controversial rule in American football used by the National Football League from 1999 until 2013. It stated:\nNFL Rule 3, Section 22, Article 2, Note 2. When [an offensive] player is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body. Also, if the player has tucked the ball into his body and then loses possession, it is a fumble. \nThis is referred to as the tuck rule because the ball leaving the quarterback's hands is considered a forward pass even if the quarterback intends not to pass the ball, but instead continues the forward motion to tuck the ball back into his body. Only once the forward motion of the arm is completed, and the ball tucked into the quarterback's body, would a subsequent loss of possession be considered a fumble.\nMike Pereira, the former director of officiating of the NFL, noted that the design of the rule avoids the question of the quarterback's intention, except that the referee still must judge whether the initial forward movement of the arm was \"intentional\".\nHistory.\nJets vs. Patriots (2001).\nThe tuck rule was called in Week 2 of an NFL regular season matchup on September 23, 2001, between the New England Patriots and the New York Jets. With 1:01 left in the second quarter, Patriots defensive end Anthony Pleasant apparently forced Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde to fumble the ball, with Patriots defensive end Richard Seymour making a recovery. The call was overturned upon review and ruled an incomplete pass, with the tuck rule cited. The Jets tied the game with a field goal on that drive before going on to win 10–3. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick referred to this game after the subsequent Tuck Rule Game, telling ESPN, \"I knew what the ruling should have been because we had dealt with that play a little bit earlier in the year on the other side of it.\"\nRaiders vs. Patriots (\"Tuck Rule Game\") (2001).\nThe tuck rule resulted in a controversial finish to an AFC divisional playoff game on January 19, 2002, between the New England Patriots and the Oakland Raiders.\nIn the closing moments of the fourth quarter of the game in a snowy Foxboro Stadium, with New England trailing by three points, New England quarterback Tom Brady dropped back to pass. After he had begun a passing motion, Brady clearly ceased his throwing motion, pulled his right hand down below his shoulder and had touched the ball to his left hand when, coming off the strong side corner blitz, Charles Woodson knocked the ball out of Brady's hands. Raiders middle linebacker Greg Biekert then fell on the loose football. The officials initially called the play a recovered fumble, which would have sealed the victory for the Raiders. After instant replay, referee Walt Coleman reversed this call, declared the play an incomplete forward pass, and gave possession back to New England. In explaining the reversal to the crowd, Coleman stated that the ball was moving forward at the time it was dropped. In later interviews, Coleman stated that it was his explanation, not the reversal, that was in error; the ball was moving backwards when it was lost, but the tuck rule applied. Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri later tied the game with a 45-yard field goal; in overtime, the Patriots defeated the Raiders on another field goal. Two games later, the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI. \nThe NFL defended the call, but Bruce Allen, who ran the front office for the Raiders at the time of the game, said, \"The rule itself doesn't bother me, but the way the rule is written, it was a fumble.\" The NFL's Competition Committee re-examined the rule after the season but did not change the rule.\nRedskins vs. Broncos (2005).\nThe tuck rule was enforced in a regular season game on October 9, 2005, between the Washington Redskins and the Denver Broncos. Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer lost the football while in the Broncos' own end zone. Referees initially called the play a fumble and awarded the Redskins a safety, but after instant-replay review cited the tuck rule in reversing the decision and calling it an incomplete pass. The Broncos eventually went on to win the game. Afterwards, Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs said, \"It makes no sense to me. It's the way it's worded. I think everybody probably sees that and says it's a bad rule.\" Pereira said the rule came up in games about 12 to 15 times per season and explained that despite its unpopularity, the competition committee had been unable to come up with a better rule.\nChiefs vs. Ravens (2010 season).\nThe tuck rule was also enforced in an NFL playoff game on January 9, 2011, between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Baltimore Ravens. After this game, Mike Pereira, the former NFL vice-president for officiating, stated that he was no longer in support of the tuck rule.\nRepeal.\nIn March 2013, the NFL competition committee proposed that league owners eliminate the tuck rule. The owners abolished the rule with a 29–1 vote at the 2013 annual meeting in Phoenix on March 20, 2013. The only team to vote against the elimination of the tuck rule was the Pittsburgh Steelers, while the New England Patriots and Washington Redskins abstained from the vote. Afterwards, referring obliquely to the 2002 Tuck Rule Game, Patriots owner Robert Kraft said, \"I love the tuck rule, and forever will, and I know [longtime Raiders owner] Al Davis, may he rest in peace, is probably smiling.\"\nThe current rule reads:\nPasser Tucks Ball. If the player loses possession of the ball during an attempt to bring it back toward his body, or if the player loses possession after he has tucked the ball into his body, it is a fumble."

It is a major event for club rowers and schools and events are held for open, women, open junior, women's junior, under 23, lightweight, adaptive and coastal boats.\nEach crew member of the first, second and third placed crews in each event receive gold, silver and bronze medals respectively. The club champion in each event (i.e. the highest placed non-composite crew) also receives a wooden club champions plaque to display in their clubhouse.\nHistory.\nThe Championships were inaugurated in 1972 and held at the National Watersports Centre in Nottingham, which had only been built the previous year.\nIn 2010, the Regatta adopted the title British Rowing Championships to reflect the change in name of the Amateur Rowing Association to British Rowing. The logo and branding now reflects that of British Rowing. The 40th anniversary of the Championships was celebrated in 2012. Although it has been the practice for the Championships to be held in Scotland at the Strathclyde Country Park every fourth year, the 2014 Championships was held in Nottingham. This was because Scotland hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Rowing Championships at Strathclyde Country Park. Since 2016, the Championships have only been held in Nottingham.\nA decision was taken in 2012 that in order to raise the standard of senior competition, the senior events from the Championships would be moved to autumn from 2013. This resulted in the Championships splitting into the senior championships and junior championships, with the latter continuing to be held during July. \nIn 2019, the Senior Championships were cancelled due to insufficient entries and the 2020 edition was not scheduled, with British Rowing stating it was reviewing the dates and format following the lack of entries for the 2019 Championships.

        "title": "Argonaut Rowing Club",
        "text": "The Argonaut Rowing Club is an amateur rowing club in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The club was founded in 1872. The current junior head coach is Connor Elsdon. In the past, the club fielded teams in ice hockey and football, and the football team continues today as the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.\nHistory.\nThe club, one of the oldest and largest of its type in Canada, dates back to 1872, founded by a group of amateur oarsmen known as the \"Orioles\", which had been participating in races in southern Ontario in the 1860s. The founders chose the blue colours of Oxford and Cambridge universities (the \"Double Blue\") as the club colours. The first president was Henry O'Brien.\nThe original club house was at the foot of York Street in Toronto Harbour (now filled in and part of the train tracks south of Union Station). It was only large enough for one boat, replaced by a larger clubhouse that was lost by fire in 1879 and rebuilt. The club relocated to the current Dowling Avenue location in 1921 after the harbour location was redeveloped for port usage, purchasing land along the waterfront within the new breakwater protected shoreline. In 1947, a fire gutted the club house at Dowling, and almost destroyed the Grey Cup, which was on display at the club at the time.\nLotte Marks' \"Argonaut Waltzes\" (1899) is a musical work dedicated to the Argonaut Rowing Club of Toronto.\nArgonaut rowing teams have represented Canada at several Olympics. Argonaut teams represented Canada at 1904, 1908, 1912 and 1952 while Argonaut members represented Canada at other Olympics. Club membership declined in the late 1970s and by 1979, the Argonauts only had four members represent the club at the Henley Regatta. The club made a recovery in the 1980s to the current state.\nFootball.\nClub members also participated in other sports including the football Argonauts, which was founded as the Argonaut Rugby Football Club in 1873. The football team eventually became a professional club (and adopted its team colours from the rowing club, which they still use to this day) and its revenues subsidized the club as a whole. The football team was sold in 1956, and the funds from the sale were used to set up a trust which funds rowing club activities. Two years later, in 1958, the football team joined the Canadian Football League, where it has played since.\nIce hockey.\nThe club also fielded ice hockey teams in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) on and off from 1904 to 1923. The Argonauts operated senior ice hockey, intermediate ice hockey and junior ice hockey teams during their time in the OHA. The junior team won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHA champions in the 1911–12 season and the 1919–20 season. The junior team also won the national championship at the 1920 Memorial Cup, participating under the name Toronto Canoe Club Paddlers.\nThe ice hockey team is credited by Frank Selke as the originators of the modern defence pairing. Until 1906, defencemen in ice hockey were known as the \"point\" and \"cover point\". The two points lined up one behind the other at face offs. The Argonaut team moved the players to \"left\" and \"right\" in the positions used today. The setup is considered to be originated from the style of plays of the Argonauts. The team ran set plays reminiscent of football, and moved the players to fit the set plays. The Argonauts were very successful in the first decade of the 1900s and the style caught on in the OHA.\nRegular season statistics for the senior team\nFacilities.\nThe club uses the 4,000 metre long Ontario Place West Channel water course running along the Western Beaches of Toronto from the west side of Ontario Place to the mouth of the Humber River within the breakwall. The current clubhouse is a two-storey brick building."

        "title": "Roy and HG's State of Origin commentary",
        "text": "Broadcast on the Triple J radio station to simulcast with the annual three-game rugby league State of Origin series, Australian comedians Roy and HG (played by John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver) provide a commentary of the match at hand. An extension of the duo's \"This Sporting Life\" radio program, also on Triple J, Roy and HG's use of comedy makes their sporting calls unique from that provided by other media sources, and has earned a cult following. With the duo's move to Triple M radio in 2009, and the end of This Sporting Life, the State of Origin commentary is currently on hiatus.\nHistory.\nA unique deviation from the usual format of the Triple J State of Origin coverage occurred in Game One of the 2007 Series, when Roy Slaven was unavailable to be present for the commentary. As a replacement, HG Nelson was joined by former New South Wales player Jason Stevens and Triple J radio personality Scott Dooley. King Wally Otto's pre-game build-up was replaced by Triple J presenter Jason Whalley, dubbed \"The Ancient Voice of the Rhomb\".\nFormat.\nBuild-up.\nAt 7:30pm on the night of a State of Origin match, Triple J interrupts its normal evening broadcasts (\"Super Request\") in New South Wales and Queensland, and the State of Origin coverage begins with a fanfare of horns. A lengthy introduction to State of Origin rugby league is given by \"King Wally Otto in the Soundproof Booth\" (a pseudonym for well-known Australian voice-over presenter Robbie McGregor). This introduction, which can last for 5 minutes or more, features King Wally Otto enthusiastically reading an elaborate Doyle and Pickhaver script, which more often than not culminates in a list of Former Origin Greats (\"F.O.G.s\"), and anecdotes about their achievements or foibles. It is also common for Otto to announce a 'theme' for the year's three game series, often to do with current events (such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq). A twist on this was when the 2006 series was heavily \"sponsored\" by fictitious Lakemba-based car dealership \"Frosty Lahood Motors Australia\".\nAt the end of Otto's build-up to the game, he usually switches to a rhapsodic introduction for Roy and HG themselves, ending with the question \"are you there...HG?\" Taking his role of the 'sports announcer' of the pair, HG Nelson thanks King Wally Otto in the Soundproof Booth, welcomes listeners to their State of Origin coverage and provides further build-up to the game at hand. Nelson introduces the State of Origin contest as being played for the \"highest principles on the planet\"; those principles being \"Peace through violence, harmony through brutality and getting everyone to \"shut-up\" and behave just like us or they’ll cop a boot up the date [buttocks] and a fist of fives.\"\nDuring the first few minutes, Nelson's broadcasting partner, \"Rampaging\" Roy Slaven remains silent until eventually introduced to the airwaves by Nelson. Roy's character, a supposed former player of the game who takes more of an 'expert commentary' role to Nelson's main call, is often restrained with his opening remarks; that is, until his enthusiasm for the game provokes a passionate expression of opinion about the contest to Nelson and the listening audience. The pair talk about the build-up to the game for approximately half an hour, often with Slaven recounting supposed interactions he had with stars of the league (he professes intimate friendships with virtually every current and former player of rugby league). An example of one of these (obviously fictional) exchanges was before the first game of the 2006 series which New South Wales was entering after winning the previous three in a row. With many media commentators declaring the concept of State of Origin dead after such one-sided results, Roy contacted Wally Lewis for his thoughts on the upcoming series, to which he replied \"oh, are they still playing that?\"\nNational anthem.\nAt approximately 8:00pm the players enter the field and line up for the singing of the Australian national anthem; an occasion which provides one of Roy and HG's most infamous twists on traditional sports commentary. As the television pictures show footage of a vocalist singing \"Advance Australia Fair,\" the Triple J coverage completely replaces the song with Lionel Rose's 1969 song \"I Thank You.\" The choice of this song probably is due to the opening lyrics \"When a boy becomes a man...\" (signifying young players 'stepping up' to the challenge of State of Origin football) as well as the inherent violence associated with the former-boxer, Rose. The Lionel Rose song is faded out by Roy and HG when they sense the real singer is wrapping up their performance (usually after the first chorus of \"I Thank You\"), with Roy and HG invariably praising the singer for a fantastic performance. Before the beginning of State of Origin I 2008, because the buildup to the game had been quite emotional as Jack Gibson had recently died, a violin solo of \"Waltzing Matilda\" was played during the national anthem, with both Roy and HG applauding the 'beautiful' rendition.\nGame commentary.\nCompared to the more traditional commentary on Channel 9 and ABC Radio's Grandstand, Roy and HG are often less restrained in their criticism of players and teams. This feature of their call may be off-putting for certain fans who are sensitive to hearing players in their team criticised (being called a \"goose\", etc.), but is generally taken in the humorous way it is intended. The duo's commentary, and particularly Slaven's, often features over the top reactions to the game at hand, such as calling for entire teams of players to be sacked after losses, or even questioning whether losing teams will ever win another match in the future.\nThough Doyle was born in New South Wales, and both currently reside within the state, this gives seemingly little influence to any commentary 'bias'. Roy and HG are also quick to relish the more 'unsavoury' actions of players on the field which are ignored or downplayed by more traditional commentators. This includes spitting, dacking, wedgies, gouging, groping, pig-rooting, fighting and roughhousing in general.\nRoy and HG's State of Origin commentary is also noteworthy for the use of nicknames to refer to many of players on the field, rather than their surnames. While standard, well-known nicknames such as \"Sticky\" Ricky Stuart and \"Mad Dog\" MacDougall are used, the duo are renowned for their creation and use of more obscure 'running joke'-type nicknames about players. A partial list of nicknames is presented below:\nPlayer nicknames.\nIn addition to the players, Roy and HG frequently refer to two former top grade referees: Kelvin Jeffes and Moghseen Jadwat, ironically describing them as the two best officials ever to grace the sport (in actuality, Jadwat's top-grade career was decidedly short (1997-8) whilst Jeffes has only controlled one Origin fixture). This is in contrast to Roy and HG's typical opinions of refereeing staff (e.g. Bill Harrigan, which is often vocally critical beyond the norm for sports commentators).\nOther sayings.\nRoy and HG's commentary also makes use of a number of sayings which are infrequently used by the majority of rugby league broadcasters.\nRelationship with television coverage.\nBy their own account, Roy and HG's commentary of the match is broadcast live from a card table adjacent to the halfway line of the playing field. In reality, their call is very much centred around the pictures that Channel 9 broadcast on their TV coverage with, for example, the duo being unsure of who won a penalty from the referee until the TV pictures change to a shot of the restart of play happening. Roy and HG use this aspect to add further comedy to their commentary, for example by calling the Channel 9 commentary team \"men eating ice cream cones\" for their unnecessary use of hand-held microphones during studio broadcasts. Another memorable example of the TV-centric flow of Slaven and Nelson's commentary was during the 2004 series when Channel 9 introduced the \"Skycam\" camera-on-wires which 'hovered' above the players' heads. This expensive technology, which had notably poor picture quality, often could not keep up with the flow of play was over-used by Channel 9 during the broadcast, was frequently blasted by Roy and HG for disorientating them with the \"telecast from the lunar surface.\" Slaven and Nelson also give back-handed criticism to Channel 9's low-brow \"football entertainment\" show \"The Footy Show\", sarcastically remarking what a \"funny show\" it is.\nDigital divide.\nThough many listen to the call without accompaniment, HG Nelson's introductory comments always invite listeners to \"tickle your television to the league channel down your end of the swamp, turn down the sound and turn up Triple J.\" Since the early 2000s, the spread of digital television throughout Australia has caused some technical issues for the Triple J State of Origin broadcast. Roy and HG's commentary had previously arrived to viewers approximately in sync with the television pictures (although generally, regional viewers suffered a short delay between the radio and television signals). The digital delay that came with the introduction of digital TV created a noticeable gap between the analogue radio broadcast and the slower digital TV signal. HG Nelson had to preclude their broadcast that \"unfortunately we live with the digital divide, and there’s nothing we can do about it.\" In later years, however, Nelson would add that digital TV viewers should try tuning into their online stream via the Triple J website, which has its own slight delay behind the airwaves. Therefore, it is recommended that analogue TV viewers listen to the analogue radio broadcast, and digital TV viewers stream the commentary from the Triple J website."

School-aged children are generally guided toward a future in cricket, rather than baseball, especially in the private schooling system.\nBaseball Australia were previously 25% stakeholders along with Major League Baseball of the ABL when it began play in November 2010.

        "title": "North Otago Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The North Otago Rugby Football Union (NORFU) is a New Zealand rugby union province based in Oamaru and compete in the Heartland Championship. They are one of the strongest teams in The Heartland Championship, winning the Meads Cup section of the competition in its second year, 2007 as well as 2010. Their home ground is Whitestone Contracting Stadium, formerly Centennial Park.\nThe North Otago Rugby Football Union was founded in 1927 and over the years they have had many highs and lows. In 1930 they hosted the All Blacks before the first test against the British and Irish Lions, In 1962 they hosted and beat Australia during their tour of New Zealand. In the NPC they had sat near the bottom of the third division table until they beat Horowhenua-Kapiti Rugby Football Union in the final in 2002 and moved to the second division where they were regular semi-finalists.\nIn the 2006 Heartland Championship they lost the Meads Cup semi-final to Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union after being pre-tournament favourites. In 2007 they won the Meads Cup after\nIn the 2010 competition they won the Meads Cup final 39–18 at home against Wanganui.\nHistory.\nThe \"North Otago Rugby Football Union\" was formed in 1904 but didn't join the NZRFU until 1927. In 1930 North Otago played the All Blacks at the Oamaru Showgrounds before the All Blacks first test against the British and Irish Lions, however North Otago lost 6-34. 1946 saw the first Hanan Shield fixture with a 6–9 loss against South Canterbury. In 1947 North Otago had two Ranfurly Shield challenges but both were unsuccessful. 1962 saw the province record a fantastic win over Australia 14-13 and another win against Southland 19-8 but then a narrow loss to Otago 14–11. In 1965 North Otago produced some magic rugby to beat Otago 18–11. The highlight of the 1971 season was the selection of Kurow's Phil Gard for the All Blacks, fourth test against the Lions at Eden Park. The 1980s were unsuccessful years as North Otago won very few games.\n The highlight of the early 1990s was a Ranfurly Shield challenge in 1993 when Auckland brought the trophy on tour. The crowd went delirious after 5 minutes when Brent McEwan scored a try from a set move to give North Otago a 5–0 lead. However, the talent of Auckland then shone through and they scored 139 unanswered points. John Kirwan scored eight tries. The 1997 season proved to be a fairytale effort with the team having its best season yet in NPC rugby. The side finished as top qualifier, won its home semi final and went down to in the final.\n 1998 saw North Otago lose only two of its nine games. North Otago was now winning more games in a season than it used to win in a decade. A lot of the credit for the massive resurgence in North Otago rugby during this period must go to the outstanding coaches, Greg Shipton and Peter Cook. In 2000, Glenn Moore took over the reins with Paddy Stewart. Moore, a former Mid Canterbury representative, had instant success with the side and only narrowly lost the final against East Coast 21–25. 2001 looked like North Otago's season, winning all of its seven games. However, in the final it was a disappointing four-point loss to South Canterbury 16–20. 2002 saw the North Otago Rugby Union celebrate its 75th jubilee and it indeed appropriate that in the 75th year of its existence the side should take the third division title beating Horowhenua 43-19 before an ecstatic crowd. 2003 and the challenges of Division Two was very much a daunting task. However, the team responded magnificently and finished in the top four but lost the semi-final to Hawke's Bay in Napier in controversial circumstances. The highlight of the season was a superb win against Counties-Manukau. 2004 saw North Otago once again playing above its weight making the semi-finals before going down to Nelson Bays.\nClub Rugby.\nNorth Otago Rugby Football Union is made up of six clubs who play against the Otago Metropolitan Premier Division 2 teams in a combined club competition before playing out for the local Citizens Shield:\nThe North Otago Rugby Football Union clubs used to play against the South Canterbury club sides in a combined competition before the combined Otago competition.\nNorth Otago also have two strong secondary school teams:\nRepresentative Rugby.\nNorth Otago have handed out some upsets to teams in the past including a win over Australia 14–13 in 1962.\nThe highlight of the early 1990s was a Ranfurly Shield challenge in 1993 when Auckland brought the trophy on tour. The crowd went delirious after 5 minutes when Brent McEwan scored a try from a set move to give North Otago a 5–0 lead. However, the talent of Auckland then shone through and they scored 139 unanswered points. John Kirwan scored eight tries.\n2002 saw the North Otago Rugby Football Union celebrate its 75th anniversary and it indeed appropriate that in the 75th year of its existence the side should take the third division title beating Horowhenua 43-19 before an ecstatic crowd. North Otago are currently the holders of the Hanan Shield.\nIn 2007, North Otago won the Meads Cup trophy in the Heartland Championship, defeating Wanganui 25–8.\nRanfurly Shield.\nSince North Otago were founded they have played in 15 Ranfurly Shield matches but are yet to win. North Otago played its first challenge on 27 August 1938 going down to Otago at Carisbrook by 12–0. Their most recent Shield challenge was on 28 August 2020 against Canterbury.\nHanan Shield.\nThe Hanan Shield is one of the most prestigious trophies in New Zealand's domestic rugby union competition. First played for in 1946, the Hanan Shield is based on a challenge system played between North Otago, South Canterbury and Mid Canterbury. North Otago's best win was in 1997 when they defeated South Canterbury 20–17 to bring the Hanan Shield back to North Otago for the first time in 30 years.\nNorth Otago in Super Rugby.\nNorth Otago, along with Otago and Southland, make up the Highlanders team that competes in the Super Rugby competition against other New Zealand teams, as well as Australian and South African teams.\nNorth Otago 2002 season.\nStill getting over the loss of the 2001 Division 3 NPC final against South Canterbury, North Otago set out to play harder, faster, and more superb rugby in 2002, And that is exactly what they did. Starting their season off with a Hanan Shield match against Mid Canterbury, winning the game 43–16. For the first match of the NPC season they played West Coast. North Otago hardly let the coasters have the ball and eased to a 60–6 victory. South Canterbury had the home advantage for the next match but North Otago were still haunted by the memories of 2001 and it showed, North Otago sealing the game 39-9 and also taking the Lochore Cup off them. Back home with the shields and cups, North Otago showed Buller who was boss and a 38–15 win was created. A trip up to Waikanae to play Horowhenua-Kapiti was good for the boys and even better was the 40–0 at the end of the 80 minutes. Back home for their next two games and sitting nicely at the top of the standings they had nothing to worry about. Wanganui tried but failed to win, North Otago running away with the game 73–7. Poverty Bay came and went with nothing, scoring five tries but still not good enough losing to North Otago 49–32. Masterton was the next venue for North Otago against Wairarapa-Bush But the locals were unable to cause an upset North Otago winning 27–14. A Quick trip to Taupō to play King Country and almost repeating their last game's score winning 27–16. So North Otago were into the semi-finals. And again having to play South Canterbury in a final. But North Otago provided way to strong winning the match 58–10. So North Otago secured a home final and had to play Horowhenua-Kapiti. With conditions not quite what players and fans had hoped for, North Otago started pulling. Horowhenua-Kapiti tried to get back in the game but North Otago were playing a higher grade of rugby and when the referee blew his whistle to end the match, North Otago had won the title they had been waiting more than four years to get, winning the match 43–19.\nNorth Otago 2007 season.\nSince winning the third division title in 2002 North Otago has punched well above its weight making the 2nd Division semi finals in 2003,04, and 2005 but losing all three. In 2006 they entered the Heartland Championship but again losing in the semi-final. But 2007 was a new year and north otago were focused on making the final. North Otago's first game was against buller in Oamaru. Buller managed to get 20 points in but North Otago more than doubled their score taking it away 51–20. A trip to Gisbourne and another win north otago beating Poverty Bay 31–11.\nNorth Otago went back home for a Hanan Shield defence against South Cantbury, and continued in their winning streak beating SC 26–7. Another home game another win North Otago beating East Coast 38–5.\nIt was then off to play Wanganui. The Wanganui crowd cheered their team on but their cheering could not prevent North Otago's 39–16 win. King Country came down to play but they never got in the game and North Otago cruised out to a 52–5 lead. Wairarapa Bush tried hard and only just bet North Otago 15–7. One more pool match for North Otago to play and another home game. The crowd came to watch North Otago win but the win never came, Mid-Canterbury took the game and earned the 25–22 win.\n But the season was not over. North Otago had secured a home semi-final and it was against Wairarapa Bush. Last time the teams faced it was Wairarapa who won, but this time (with the help of loyal locals) North Otago showed the public who was stronger and won the match 30–13. So it was into the finals for North Otago. The conditions were perfect and the local Oamaru people had come out in force to wish their team well. North Otago played hard but so did Wanganui. And the game looked like it may have gone Wanganuis way. But North Otago stayed strong and then turned up the heat winning the Heartland Championship Meads Cup Final 25-8\nNotable players.\nAll Blacks.\nThere have only been two players selected for the All Blacks whilst playing their club rugby in North Otago.\nIn 1965 and 1966 Ian (Spooky) Smith, who played for the Old Boys Club was selected for tests against South Africa and Campbell Lamberton's Lions.\nKurow's Phil Gard was selected for the All Blacks in 1971 when he played the fourth and final test against the British Lions and was on the All Blacks 1972 internal tour.\nChampionships.\nNorth Otago won the 3rd Division title in 2002 with a 43–19 win against Horowhenua-Kapiti, which took them into the 2nd Division for the 2003 season.\nAnd in 2007 North Otago won the Heartland Championship beating Wanganui 25–8, and also beat Wanganui in the 2010 final 39–18. All Finals were played at Centennial Park in Oamaru.\nClub Rugby.\nCitizens Shield.\nThe Citizens Shield is North Otago's Premier Men's senior club competition. First awarded in 1903, with the Oamaru Football Club the inaugural holders, it has been played for annually ever since with the only brief breaks happening during World War 1 and 2."

The tour itinerary consisted of 13 first-class matches, including a series of 5 Test matches against Australia in which The Ashes were at stake.\nTour review.\nThe tour was the first to have Test status after the First World War. It followed tours by the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team which played a number of first-class matches in England, South Africa and Australia immediately after the war. The last Ashes series had been the 1912 Triangular Tournament held in England that year.\nAlthough the tourists were relatively successful in their first-class matches against the Australian state teams, losing only one, the Test series \"resulted, as everyone knows, in disaster\" and England became the first team ever to lose every match in a five-Test series.\n\"Wisden\" commented that the chief cause of England's failure was the bowling, because all of the bowlers used were expensive and recorded high averages. Much has been made of Australia's ability to recover from the effects of the war more quickly than England and \"Wisden\" commented that \"English cricket had not had time to regain its pre-war standard\".\nEngland touring party.\nThe England touring party consisted of 16 players led by Essex all-rounder Johnny Douglas.\nWhen the party was originally selected, Reggie Spooner was invited to be the team captain but he was obliged to stand down for domestic reasons. Vallance Jupp had been selected too but was unable to travel. Jupp's withdrawal was shortly before departure and meant that his replacement Bill Hitch had to catch a later boat than the main party. There was another withdrawal when Jack Hearne was taken ill during the Second Test and could not play again that season.\nThere was a controversy over Rockley Wilson who sent match reports by cable to the \"Daily Express\". As a result, MCC resolved at a meeting the following May to bar players from reporting on matches in which they were involved.\nAustralian players in Test series.\nAustralia used 14 players in the Test series. Eight players took part in all five matches including the captain Warwick Armstrong.\nCeylon.\nThe English team had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

England chose 30 different players across the five Tests - still the record for the most players used by one side in a series.\nIn addition to the Test matches, the Australian team played first-class matches against all the major teams in England, plus some less important matches.

The Australian tourists were captained by Bill Woodfull, while the home side were led by Percy Chapman, who was dropped in favour of Bob Wyatt in the final Test.\n1930 Australian Team Ashes warm-up.\nBefore touring England for the 1930 Ashes Tour, the Australian team led by Bill Woodfull headed to Tasmania to play two first-class matches against Tasmania. The first match was played at the NTCA Ground before the teams moved on to Hobart. Hobart paper \"The Mercury\" said:\nAfter leaving Port Melbourne on ship the Nairana, the Australians arrived in Launceston via the Tamar River at 9am on 8 March 1930, as \"a big crowd waited to greet the tourists\". Later that day, they started their match against a Tasmanian team that included Laurie Nash. The hosts won the toss and batted in \"perfect weather\", despite being bowled out for 157. Fast-bowler, Alan Fairfax was the main destroyer, taking 4 for 36 (4/36) in 13 overs. Only wicket-keeping opener James Atkinson scored a half-century, as Tasmania collapsed from 1/50. The Australians began their reply positively, with Bill Ponsford and Stan McCabe taking the score to 120 without loss. After Ponsford was dismissed on 36, Alan Kippax and McCabe saw out the final overs of the day, with McCabe finishing not out on 93 and Kippax undefeated on eight.\nThe next day, The Australians went fishing at the Great Lake, south of Launceston, before resuming the match on Monday. After McCabe scored his century, Australia stumbled to 3/163, bringing Bradman to the crease. In Nash's second over, he trapped Bradman leg before wicket for just 20 scored in 24 minutes. The Australian were eventually bowled out for 311, despite Gerald James taking 5/97 in 22 overs. Although Nash got the wicket of Bradman, the batsmen attacked him, taking 1/82 in 13 overs. By the end of the days play, Tasmania were already under pressure at 6/109.\nThe next day saw Tasmania bowled out for 158, as Nash was the only batsman to offer any resistance with 49. The Australians were eventual victors by ten wickets. They won the following match in Hobart, before regaining the Ashes 2–1.\nThe Australians had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to England and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1962–63",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured Australia and New Zealand between October 1962 and March 1963 with a one-match stopover in Colombo, \"en route\" to Australia. The tour was organised by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and, in all matches other than Tests, the team was called MCC. In Australia, the tour itinerary consisted of 15 first-class matches, including the five-match Test series against Australia in which The Ashes were at stake. It was the last England cricket tour of Australia where the team travelled by ship.\nThe Test series was drawn and so Australia retained The Ashes. England won the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by seven wickets but Australia levelled the series in the next match at the Sydney Cricket Ground with an eight wicket victory. After the fourth Test was drawn, England captain Ted Dexter was expected to launch an all-out attempt to win the fifth and so claim the series and The Ashes. He adopted a safety first approach instead, which meant the match became a dull draw, and he was heavily criticised for his negative tactics. In other matches, the MCC team were unconvincing, their few successes having counterpoint in heavy defeats by both New South Wales and a Combined XI team. After leaving Australia in February, England played a three-match Test series in New Zealand.\nBackground to the tour.\nAustralia, led by Richie Benaud, had won The Ashes back from England in the 1958–59 series. Australia won four of the Tests in that series with one drawn. In the 1961 series in England, Australia had retained The Ashes by winning two Tests to one. Since then, England had convincingly defeated Pakistan in the 1962 series and there was a measure of optimism that the 1962–63 team might succeed in Australia although, as E. W. Swanton put it: \"most judges accorded them a sporting chance of winning back the Ashes, but no more\".\nThe big pre-tour issue for England was encapsulated in the title of an editorial written by Gordon Ross in the 1962 edition of the \"Playfair Cricket Annual\": \"Who will lead in Australia?\" At the beginning of the 1962 season, England's Test captaincy was in a state of flux. Peter May had been captain for a record 41 Tests through 1955 to 1961, but he missed two matches in the 1961 Ashes series due to illness and he then declined to tour India, Pakistan and Ceylon in 1961–62, as also did Colin Cowdrey, Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. Ross believed there were three candidates to succeed May. One was Cowdrey who had been May's vice-captain for several years and another was Ted Dexter who had accepted the captaincy for the tour of the sub-continent. Dexter, however, had not been highly successful because, although England won their series in Pakistan 1–0, they lost the series in India 2–0 and that was India's first series victory over England. Ross' third option was David Sheppard, who had been out of cricket for over five years while he pursued his career as a churchman. Sheppard was owed long overdue leave and was expected to take a sabbatical so he could make a return to first-class cricket with Sussex, even if not with England.\nAhead of the 1962 series against Pakistan, Dexter was asked to continue as captain and he led England to big wins in the first two Tests, but then Cowdrey was given the job in the third Test which began on 5 July. England won that match by an innings. Cowdrey was then asked to captain the amateurs in the last-ever Gentlemen v Players match, starting at Lord's on 18 July. According to \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", the match was \"in some respects a Test trial\" because the MCC team for Australia would be chosen at the end of the month. Dexter and Sheppard were also playing for the amateurs; the professionals were led by Trueman. The plot thickened. Cowdrey had to withdraw from the Gentlemen team following an attack of nephrolithiasis and Dexter was appointed instead. Sheppard opened for Gentlemen and scored 112. He and Dexter, who scored 55, shared a second wicket partnership of 97. Next day, the media were moreorless unanimous in calling for Sheppard to lead the team in Australia. Hours later, MCC offered the job to Dexter, who accepted it; he also captained England in the last two Tests against Pakistan. The Gentlemen v Players match ended in a draw, but \"Wisden\" was in no doubt that Trueman's professionals would have won convincingly if rain had not prematurely curtailed the proceedings.\nThe 17-man squad was duly selected with no real surprises, except possibly the omission of Tony Lock, but he had been out of form in the 1962 season. Lock had something of a last word, however, because he was hired by Western Australia as their overseas player for the winter and he helped the Combined XI defeat MCC at the WACA Ground. He went on to captain the state team from 1963–64 to 1970–71. One problem role was wicket-keeper. England had not had a settled keeper since Godfrey Evans and, as Gordon Ross said, it was \"a department in which the selectors seem to vacillate more than in most\". They chose John Murray who had been first choice for the 1961 Ashes series and his backup was Alan Smith who had yet to play Test cricket.\nThe Duke of Norfolk was chosen as team manager with Alec Bedser as his assistant. Norfolk was a surprise choice but he was a former MCC president and a keen patron of cricket in Sussex. It had been expected that Billy Griffith as MCC secretary would manage the tour but he needed to remain at Lord's to oversee the abolition of amateur status and the introduction of one-day cricket. Norfolk had to return to Britain for a month during the tour and Griffith flew out as his interim replacement.\nAlec Bedser had last played for England in 1955 (he retired from first-class cricket in 1960) and his career total of 236 Test wickets remained a world record. As the 1962–63 series began, it seemed certain that Bedser would see his record being broken. Brian Statham had 229 Test wickets, Richie Benaud 219 and Fred Trueman 216. In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, Statham took his 237th wicket when he had Barry Shepherd caught in the gully by Trueman. When the series ended, Statham had 242 wickets. Trueman and Benaud were both tied with Bedser on 236. Statham soon lost the record as he did not play in the New Zealand series, where Trueman took another 14 wickets to overtake him and extend the record to 250.\nTour itinerary.\nThe following is a list of the 28 matches played by England/MCC in Ceylon and Australia (see English cricket team in New Zealand in 1962–63 for the New Zealand matches). 15 are rated as first-class fixtures. Test matches are listed in bold. The matches in \"italics\" were not first-class.\nTest series.\nAustralia and England played five Tests between 30 November 1962 and 20 February 1963. The series ended 1–1 with three matches drawn:\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"Wisden\" pointed out that this match was the first Ashes Test at Brisbane to end in a draw. Their view was that a draw was a fair result because, while Australia went close to winning, England deserved something from the match for a fighting performance. Alan Smith made his Test debut for England. Richie Benaud won the toss and decided to bat but Australia struggled to reach 194/6 against a fine performance by Fred Trueman who took three of the wickets and held two catches. At that point, Brian Booth was joined by Ken Mackay and a recovery began. Booth's fluent innings ended on the first day after he had scored 112. Mackay and Benaud then built a partnership of 91 and Australia eventually totalled 404 all out.\nGeoff Pullar and David Sheppard got England off to a decent start with an opening partnership of 62, after which both were dismissed within a few deliveries of each other. Although England struggled against Benaud, who took six wickets, they finally reached a creditable 389 all out after half-centuries by Peter Parfitt, Ken Barrington and Ted Dexter. Australia, leading by 15 on first innings, hoped to make a big score on the fourth day but by then the pitch had become very slow. They reached 362/4 at close of play and Benaud decided to declare immediately on the final morning. England needed 378 to win in six hours but they were never up with the clock despite some good batting by Pullar, Sheppard and Dexter. With half an hour left, England were 261/6 and Benaud crowded the bat to try and capture the last four wickets. Barry Knight and Fred Titmus held firm, however, and the result was a draw.\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\n\"Wisden\" described the match as a \"thrilling struggle throughout\" and England won by seven wickets with 75 minutes to spare. Australia were unchanged from the first Test, while England introduced Tom Graveney and Len Coldwell in place of Peter Parfitt and Barry Knight.\nAustralia struggled on the first day and were 164/6 at one point but reached 263/7 at the close. Chasing 316, England quickly slumped to 19/2 but were rescued by a partnership of 175 between Cowdrey (113) and Dexter (93). Their hopes of a big lead were dashed by the fine bowling of Alan Davidson and there was little to choose between the teams as Australia began their second innings during the third day. Trueman dismissed Bob Simpson and Norm O'Neill in successive deliveries and Australia reached 105/4 at the close. Bill Lawry and Booth managed to stay together until just before lunch on day four but their scoring was very slow. Booth reached another century but the new ball came due and Trueman wiped out the tail. England needed 234 to win in just over a day. Sheppard shared in two century partnerships and scored 113 himself before being run out while going for the winning run, which was soon accounted for after he departed.\nThird Test – Sydney.\nThis Test saw a complete turnaround from the previous one as Australia won by 8 wickets soon after lunch on the fourth day to level the series. Tom Graveney was a late withdrawal from the England team because of a virus and Peter Parfitt was recalled. John Murray replaced Alan Smith as wicket-keeper. Australia left out Peter Burge and Ken Mackay for Barry Shepherd and Colin Guest to make their Test debuts.\nEngland won the toss and scored 279. Early in the Australian first innings, Murray injured his shoulder when diving to take a catch which dismissed Bill Lawry. Murray could no longer field and Parfitt kept wicket. Their Middlesex colleague Fred Titmus was in fine form with the ball and took 7/79, including one spell of 4/5 in 58 deliveries. Even so, Australia took a first innings lead of 40 and then, thanks to an outstanding new ball spell by Alan Davidson, bowled England out for only 104. Australia easily accounted for the target of 65 and finished on 67/2.\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"Wisden\" commented on a \"stalemate\" scenario in this match which was caused by both sides being more worried about losing than trying to win. Australia recalled Ken Mackay in place of Colin Guest and Wally Grout, having recovered from his broken jaw, replaced Barry Jarman. England brought in Ray Illingworth for Len Coldwell. Having recovered from his virus infection, Tom Graveney returned in place of Peter Parfitt. A change of wicket-keeper was necessary because John Murray's shoulder injury had not improved so Alan Smith was recalled.\nAustralia won the toss and, after losing two early wickets, made 393 with centuries by Neil Harvey and Norm O'Neill. When Barry Shepherd was caught by Fred Trueman off Brian Statham, it was Statham's 237th Test wicket, beating Alec Bedser's world record of 236. England struggled against fine bowling by Graham McKenzie and were all out for 331. Australia were handicapped after Alan Davidson was injured and could not bowl. With that in mind, Richie Benaud decided against a declaration and Australia batted until they were all out for 293 just before lunch on the final morning, a lead of 355. England needed to score 89 an hour to win. There was little chance of them achieving that but they still needed to make sure they did not lose the match and Ken Barrington saw to that with an innings of 132* in under four hours.\nFifth Test – Sydney.\nEngland had to win this match to reclaim The Ashes while Australia needed only a draw to retain them. The match ended as a draw and \"Wisden\" condemned it as \"a dull, lifeless game which did immense harm to cricket\". Alan Davidson and Neil Harvey both retired from Test cricket as the series ended.\nCeylon v MCC (3 October).\nThe English team had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia and played a one-day single-innings match on 3 October against the Ceylon national team, who at that time did not have Test status. The match was drawn after MCC scored 181/8 declared (David Sheppard 73; Abu Fuard 4/45) and Ceylon replied with 152/8 (C. I. Gunasekera 76; Ray Illingworth 5/59).\nOther first-class matches in Australia.\nWestern Australia v MCC (October).\nIn addition to the five Tests, MCC played ten matches against state and combined teams. Their first against a state team was at the WACA Ground in Perth, 19–22 October. In this, they convincingly defeated Western Australia by ten wickets. They encountered Tony Lock who had joined Western Australia for the season on an overseas contract. Lock took a creditable 4/68 as MCC made 303 (Titmus 88, Dexter 76). Other than a defiant 41 by captain Barry Shepherd, Western Australia could not cope with a lively pitch and were all out for 77 (David Larter 4/25, Fred Titmus 3/11, Brian Statham 3/21). They followed on and scored 274 (Statham 4/49), so MCC needed 49 to win. Geoff Pullar and Colin Cowdrey made these without loss for a ten wicket win.\nCombined XI v MCC (October).\nMCC remained in Perth and, four days later, faced a strong Combined XI which included Bob Simpson, Bill Lawry, Norm O'Neill, Barry Shepherd, Tony Lock and Graham McKenzie, plus five other Western Australia players. MCC failed to cope with rising balls outside the off stump and sixteen of their twenty wickets fell to catches by the wicket-keeper or one of the slips. Cowdrey, who opened both innings with Sheppard, suffered the indignity of a pair. Bob Simpson in contrast had an outstanding match with scores of 109 and 66* as the Combined XI won by ten wickets.\nSouth Australia v MCC (November).\nLeaving Perth, MCC were in Adelaide on 2 November to face South Australia and Gary Sobers at the Adelaide Oval. The match was drawn after rain interruptions. Although Cowdrey was out for a third successive duck, MCC responded well to the home team's 335 (Statham 4/58) with 508/9 declared (Titmus 137*, Barrington 104, Tom Graveney 99). South Australia cleared the deficit thanks to a fine innings by Sobers who then ran himself out on 99. With Sobers gone, South Australia were fighting to save the game but rain gave them respite. Captain Les Favell made a sporting declaration at 283/7, requiring MCC to score 111 in 67 minutes. Cowdrey opened with Pullar and managed to break his scoreless sequence. Pullar with 56 at a run a minute gave MCC a real chance of victory but the rain returned when they needed 16 more runs in nine minutes, and the result was a draw.\nAn Australian XI v MCC (November).\nThis match was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), 9–13 November. It was a high-scoring draw on what \"Wisden\" called a \"perfect pitch for batting\". MCC opened with 633/7 declared (Barrington 219*, Knight 108, Dexter 102, Cowdrey 88). It was the highest total by any English team on the MCG and five of the Australian bowlers conceded over 100 runs each. The select XI responded with 451 (Simpson 130, Shepherd 114) but Dexter did not enforce the follow on. He declared the second innings closed at 68/5 to try for an interesting finish, setting the select XI a target of 251 in 160 minutes. This was never likely to be achieved but, thanks to 91* by Shepherd, they had reached 201/4 when the match ended in a draw.\nNew South Wales v MCC (November).\nNew South Wales (NSW) won by an innings and 80 runs with a day to spare. Despite a resilient innings of 132 by Geoff Pullar, MCC struggled against the NSW spin bowlers to reach 348. NSW did not have the same problems and Bob Simpson (110) scored his third century in successive matches against the tourists. He and Norm O'Neill (143) shared a 2nd wicket partnership of 234. Good scores by each of the next five batsmen took NSW to 532/6 at lunch on the third day. Richie Benaud declared at that point and, by taking 7/18 himself (10/79 in the match), bowled MCC out for only 104 i just three hours.\nQueensland v MCC (November).\n\"Wisden\" said \"a draw looked the obvious result\" all through this match which was played on a pitch that offered nothing for the bowlers. Even so, much of the scoring was slow. Queensland declared their first innings at 433/7 with Ken Mackay scoring 105*. In reply, MCC built a huge 581/6 declared with Ken Barrington scoring 183*. Queensland struggled in their second innings but were never in any real danger of losing. Wes Hall hit his own wicket-keeper Wally Grout with one rising delivery and broke his jaw, which meant Grout could not play in any of the first three Tests.\nVictoria v MCC (December).\nMCC won by 5 wickets. It should have been an easy victory against a poor Victorian team but they were held up by Bill Lawry who batted for over seven hours and scored 177. Victoria were all out for 340 but MCC made hard work of things and were themselves all out for 336. They owed that to Geoff Pullar who scored 91 despite being injured and needing a runner. Queensland collapsed in their second innings after Lawry was run out and Len Coldwell helped himself to 6/49, taking four wickets with his last 26 balls. MCC needed 180 to win in four hours and made it with 40 minutes in hand after a good partnership between Sheppard and Cowdrey.\nSouth Australia v MCC (December).\nMatch drawn. Colin Cowdrey had made three successive ducks in two of the early matches, but scored 307 in MCC's second match against South Australia in December, his highest first-class score. MCC scored 474/4 on the first day and went on to 586/5 declared. Cowdrey had great support from Tom Graveney (122*) in a fifth wicket stand of 344 in only four hours. Les Favell scored 120 and Gary Sobers 89 as South Australia replied with 450 all out. MCC declared their second innings on 167/6, setting South Australia a target of 304 in four hours. The end was ruined by rain but Sobers could still hit 75* in just over an hour.\nCombined XI v MCC (January).\nPlayed at Launceston, Tasmania, this match was something of a no contest as MCC won easily by 313 runs. They batted first and scored 331/7 declared. The Combined XI were all out for 77 after Fred Trueman and David Larter took four wickets each. MCC batted again for 116/1 declared. Rain almost ended the match but instead produced a sticky wicket on the last day. This was exploited to the full by spinners David Allen and Ray Illingworth who bowled the home team out for just 57.\nVictoria v MCC (February).\nThe highlight of this match was a fine 185 by Tom Graveney in MCC's first innings of 375 after being 96/5. Victoria scored 307 (David Allen 5/43) and MCC declared their second innings at 218/5 to set a target of 287 in just over four hours. Victoria struggled to 188/9 and could only secure the draw after their last two batsmen, bowlers Keith Kirby and Alan Connolly, held out for the last sixteen minutes of play.\nPress coverage.\nThere was considerable disquiet in cricketing circles about the press coverage of the tour which focused on the Duke of Norfolk because of his aristocratic connections and horse racing interests; on Sheppard for religious reasons; and on Dexter's wife Susan, who was a model. \"Playfair\" began its review of the tour with a curt dismissal of the excessive coverage as \"\"all manner of events off the field of play\" (which are) \"copy for the newspapers\". The England players were equally unimpressed and Fred Trueman disparagingly commented: \"In no time at all, the news in the press concerning the England team centred on where the Duke of Norfolk's horses were running, what Mrs Dexter was wearing and where David Sheppard was sermonising\"\".\nThe British writer Alan Ross wrote \"Australia 63\" about his experience during the tour, consisting of typical sporting coverage of the significant matches with sections akin to a travel guide of the Australian locations he visited as he followed the tour by car. It was the third of four books he published regarding Ashes series.\nEngland squad.\nMCC selected a squad of 17 players. The tour was managed by the Duke of Norfolk with the assistance of Billy Griffith and Alec Bedser. Ted Dexter was the team captain with Colin Cowdrey as his vice-captain. The table gives the name, county club, age (i.e., on 1 October 1962) and on field roles of each player:\nEngland used 16 of their 17 players in the series. Larter was the only one to miss out on selection. Seven players took part in all five Tests. The leading batsman was Barrington with 582 runs at 72.75 per innings. The leading bowler was Trueman with 20 wickets at 26.05 runs per wicket.\nAustralia Test selections.\nAustralia, captained by Richie Benaud, selected a total of 15 players in the five Tests. Eight players took part in all five matches. Details of each Australian player includes the state he represented in 1962–63, his age on 1 October 1962, his batting hand and his style of bowling:\nAustralia's leading batsman on average was Burge with 245 runs at 61.25 per innings. He played in only three matches and the leading runscorer was Booth with 404 at 50.50 per innings. The leading bowler was Davidson with 24 wickets at 20.00 runs per wicket."

        "text": "Paul Malone Gardner (born March 5, 1956) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and a former centre, who most recently coached at Löwen Frankfurt in Germany.\nPaul Gardner is the son of former National Hockey League (NHL) player Cal Gardner and the younger brother of Dave Gardner. Paul was born in Fort Erie, Ontario while his father Cal was playing with the Boston Bruins.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Gardner played in the 1968 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Leaside.\nDrafted in 1976 by the Kansas City Scouts of the National Hockey League, he never got an opportunity to play for them - that same year, the Scouts franchise moved to Denver and was re-named the Colorado Rockies.\nColorado Rockies.\nGardner, who had also been drafted by the Toronto Toros of the World Hockey Association, instead turned pro with the Rockies' farm team the Rhode Island Reds. The bulk of his rookie pro season was spent in the National Hockey League, however, where he scored an impressive 30 goals and 59 points in sixty games. He finished second on the club in both goals and points and managed 30 more goals (in just 46 games) during his second year in the league. Despite the prolific start to his NHL career, Colorado traded him midway through his third season to the Toronto Maple Leafs, who had been rumored to be targeting Gardner prior to the March 15, 1979 NHL trade deadline.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nIn Toronto Gardner joined the same team for whom his father Cal had played four seasons. Gardner started well after the trade scoring nine points including seven goals in eleven games with the Leafs to finish the season. However the following year he struggled with just eleven goals in 45 games. After failing to make the roster to start the 1980-81 season, the Maple Leafs dealt Gardner, along with Dave Burrows to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Paul Marshall and Kim Davis.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nIn Pittsburgh Gardner rediscovered his scoring touch reeling off seasons of 34, 36 and 28 goals as one of the club's top scoring threats. His fourth year with the Penguins saw him suddenly struggle with no goals in 16 games which led to him being assigned to the Penguins minor league affiliate in Baltimore. Gardner led the AHL team in scoring with 32 goals and 81 points in just 54 games.\nWashington Capitals.\nHis solid play in the American League earned him another chance to find his game at the NHL level when the Washington Capitals offered him a contract for the 1984-85 season. Gardner managed just 2 goals and 6 points in 12 games with Washington but had an explosive season for their farm club. Gardner led the AHL in scoring with 51 goals and 130 points in just 64 games. Despite his lofty production, the Capitals opted not to bring him back for a second year.\nBuffalo Sabres.\nThe Buffalo Sabres inked Gardner to a free agent deal but he appeared in just two games with them spending the rest of the season dominating the American Hockey League again en route to his second-straight league leading performance. He potted 61 goals and 112 points for Rochester Americans then retired from professional hockey at years end.\nEleven years after retiring, while serving as the assistant coach for the Washington Capitals AHL affiliate the Portalnd Pirates Gardner was pressed into action when the team was short on players due to injury. Gardner managed to pick up an assist in the game. This assist extended an impressive accomplishment for Gardner: During his pro career he suited up with seven different American Hockey League teams and he produced at a point-a-game or better for every one of them.\nCoaching career.\nShortly after his playing career ended, Gardner jumped into the coaching profession, becoming head coach of the Newmarket Saints of the American Hockey League for four seasons. He later became an assistant coach for the Baltimore Skipjacks (later Portland Pirates after their relocation) under coach Barry Trotz. Both Trotz and Gardner were later promoted to the NHL level when they moved to Nashville to work for the expansion Predators. Gardner would be assistant coach through the 2002–03 season and then worked as a pro scout for the organization.\nIn January 2007, he was named head coach of the Russian KHL team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. He guided the team to a nine-game winning streak and made the playoffs, but was released in February 2008. In the summer of 2008, he was named head coach of Dynamo Minsk in Belarus and assistant coach of the Belarus national team. In late July 2008, his contract was cancelled due to personal reasons.\nOn December 18, 2008, he became the coach of the Hamburg Freezers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) and guided the Freezers to the playoff-quarterfinals that season. In Gardner's second season at the helm, Hamburg did not qualify for the playoffs. His contract expired at the end of the 2009-10 season.\nGardner signed with the Mississippi RiverKings of the Central Hockey League (CHL) for the 2010-11 campaign. On July 29, 2011, Gardner was relieved of his duties for the following season.\nIn September 13, 2011 Gardner was named head coach of fellow CHL team Bloomington Blaze. On January 18, 2013 Gardner was appointed head coach of the Braehead Clan of the Elite Ice Hockey League. He guided the Scottish club to the EIHL Gardiner Conference Championship and a playoff-quarterfinal appearance, but did not have his contract renewed at the end of the 2012-13 season.\nIn Mai 2013, Gardner was named head coach of Dutch Eredivisie side Tilburg Trappers, signing a two-year deal with the team. Under his guidance, the Trappers won back-to-back Dutch championship titles and Dutch cup titles.\nOn January 1, 2016, German second-division club Lausitzer Füchse hired Gardner as their new head coach. He stayed on the job through the end of the 2015-16 season. On June 29, 2016, Gardner took over the coaching job at fellow DEL2 side Löwen Frankfurt, working alongside sporting director Rich Chernomaz. He guided the Frankfurt team to the 2017 DEL2 title in his first year in charge. Gardner was sacked on March 17, 2018, during the playoff quarterfinal series against Kassel, in which the Frankfurt team had lost the first two games.\nIn 2019, Gardner was inducted into the Leaside Sports Hall of Fame. Both his brother Dave and father Cal have also been inducted into the Leaside Sports Hall of Fame."

        "text": "The Billings Volcanos were an American basketball team based in Billings, Montana that was a member of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). From 1979–80, they were called the Hawaii Volcanos. The team name is spelled \"Volcanos,\" even though the proper plural spelling for volcano would be \"volcano\"e\"s.\"\nHawaii Volcanos.\nThe franchise began as the Hawaii Volcanos \"(sic)\" in 1979, and placed (rather improbably) in the CBA's North Division with the Anchorage Northern Knights, Rochester Zeniths and Maine Lumberjacks. They played the 1979–80 season at several venues, including the Neal Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, the Conroy Bowl at Schofield Barracks, the gymnasium at Kaimuki High School, and two games at the Hilo Civic Auditorium. \nLed by former Wichita State star Bobby Wilson with 28.3 points per game, the Volcanos managed a 20–25 record: a fourth-place finish, but good enough to qualify for the conference finals against Anchorage. Due to the tremendous travel costs between the nation's 49th and 50th states, however, the Volcanos agreed to play the entire series in Anchorage (which, ironically, was actually the \"closest\" CBA city to Hawaii, at about 2,700 miles away). After Hawaii won two of the first three games, the Knights stormed back to take the next two and the best-of-five series (Anchorage would go on to win an epic seven-game final against Rochester to take the CBA crown). With attendance disappointing and travel costs very high (most of their opponents were over 5,000 miles from Hawaii), the Volcanos shifted to Billings, Montana for the 1980–81 campaign.\nOn to Montana.\nShifting their home games to the Yellowstone MetraPark in Billings, the Volcanos finished third in the Western Division with a 23–19 mark, then got revenge on Anchorage by knocking them off, two games to one, in the first round of the playoffs; they then succumbed to their in-state rival, the Montana Golden Nuggets, three games to one. Wilson again led the Volcanos in scoring with 28.8 points per game. In 1981–82, Billings won the West with a 32–14 record, topped Montana in the Western finals, three games to one, before losing to the Lancaster Lightning, four games to one, in the CBA finals; Marlon Redmond was Billings' top scorer with 25.5 points per game. In 1982–83, Carl Nicks (who had played with Larry Bird on the Indiana State team that went all the way to the 1979 NCAA championship game) signed with the Volcanos after being released by the Utah Jazz. Despite Nicks' 26.2 points per game, Billings slipped to 20–24, third in the West, and missed the playoffs. The franchise disbanded over the summer."

        "text": "Matt Johnson (born November 23, 1975) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. He played parts of 10 seasons as an enforcer in the National Hockey League with the Los Angeles Kings, Atlanta Thrashers and the Minnesota Wild. Johnson was born in Welland, Ontario, and raised in nearby Fenwick. He was known by Wild fans as Moose.\nPlaying career.\nDue to his great size and power forward abilities, many NHL scouts took great interest in Johnson. He was drafted in the second round, 33rd overall, by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft.\nAfter two-plus seasons in the Ontario Hockey League with the Peterborough Petes, Johnson joined the Kings during the 1994–95 season. During the 1998–99 season, Johnson was suspended for twelve games for sucker-punching Jeff Beukeboom in the back of the head. He remained a member of the Kings until he was chosen by the Atlanta Thrashers in the 1999 NHL Expansion Draft. On November 17, 1999, Johnson scored 10 seconds after teammate Andrew Brunette in a 5-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning to mark the then two quickest goals in Franchise history. After just one season with the Thrashers, he joined another expansion team, the Minnesota Wild, for the 2000–01 season. He was named team captain of the Wild in December 2002. Johnson played four seasons with the Wild and, to date, has had no NHL experience since the end of the 2003–04 season.\nDuring the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Johnson decided that he did not want to play hockey anymore. In an interview with a Minnesota newspaper, he explained that his shoulder (which was reconstructed during that off-season) had been feeling great and after a few months of no hockey, he would wake up in the morning with no pain or constant aches like he had when he played. He decided that he did not want to go back to being an enforcer, and a few days later, the Wild organization bought out his contract and today he remains unofficially retired.\nJohnson moved in with his parents at their farm in Pelham, Ontario during the 2005 lockout. Johnson struggled with difficulties adjusting to life after hockey. His erratic behavior eventually led to his family attempting to enroll him in rehab in spring of 2006. As of December 2017, Johnson is estranged from his family and homeless, his last known location living on the streets of Santa Monica, California. For nearly a decade, Johnson had been missing but resurfaced on December 31, 2017 in an altercation at a Santa Monica Denny's.\nIn his NHL career, Johnson appeared in 473 games, tallying 23 goals and adding 20 assists. In addition, he recorded 1,523 penalty minutes. He also appeared in 16 Stanley Cup playoff games, going scoreless with 31 penalty minutes."

        "text": "At the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the knockout stage was the second and final stage of the tournament, following the group stage. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination tournament. A third place match was also played between the two losing semi-finalists.\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\nRound of 16.\nGermany vs Paraguay.\nTwo minutes from the end of regulation time, Oliver Kahn sent a goal kick down the field, which was received by Michael Ballack. Ballack passed to Bernd Schneider whose cross was turned in by Oliver Neuville. In the 92nd minute, Roberto Acuña was sent off after punching Ballack.\nDenmark vs England.\nAfter five minutes, David Beckham launched a corner towards Rio Ferdinand, whose header was fumbled by Thomas Sørensen into the net. Michael Owen doubled England's advantage after Trevor Sinclair's pass was flicked to him by Nicky Butt. England made it 3-0 one minute before half-time when a throw-in by Danny Mills was missed by Niclas Jensen, with Beckham passing to Emile Heskey who swept the ball home. In the second half, England appeared to take their foot off the pedal, possibly with a view to conserving energy for the next round: but were easily able to snuff out any rare Danish attacks, neither side coming particularly close to scoring again.\nSweden vs Senegal.\nOn 11 minutes, a Sweden corner was headed in by Henrik Larsson. Eight minutes before half-time, Henri Camara equalised for Senegal by shooting into the bottom-left corner. Camara scored the golden goal on 104 minutes, from a similar position shooting low in off the left post. Senegal became the second African nation to reach the quarter-finals, after Cameroon in 1990.\nSpain vs Republic of Ireland.\nSpain took the lead early with a goal from Fernando Morientes. They managed to hold out until the very last minute, when a foul by Captain Fernando Hierro saw a penalty converted by Robbie Keane. After extra time ended goalless, Spain triumphed 3–2 on penalties with goalkeeper Iker Casillas emerging a hero by saving two attempts. \nMexico vs United States.\nAfter eight minutes, Claudio Reyna managed to run through the right-hand side before sending the ball to Josh Wolff, who then switched the ball over to Brian McBride who struck the ball into the net. Landon Donovan doubled the United States' advantage midway through the second half after Eddie Lewis ran through the left-hand side before sending the ball towards Donovan who headed the ball home. A frustrated Mexico also saw captain Rafael Márquez sent off late on by referee Vítor Melo Pereira for a dangerous tackle on Cobi Jones.\nBrazil vs Belgium.\nThe match saw fight and resilience from both sides. Belgium had a first half goal from Marc Wilmots ruled out after he was adjudged to have pushed Roque Júnior by referee Peter Prendergast. Goalkeepers Marcos and Geert De Vlieger were both forced into making multiple saves to contain each side from taking the lead. Despite Belgium's best efforts, Brazil took the lead on 67 minutes after Ronaldinho managed to find Rivaldo on the edge of the Belgian penalty area who controlled the ball before firing an effort, which deflected off of defender Daniel Van Buyten, into the net. Belgium continued their persistent efforts in finding a goal, but ultimately fell short and Ronaldo sealed the win for Brazil in the 87th minute after Kléberson found him unmarked in the centre, and the Brazilian striker was left to finish from 12 yards.\nJapan vs Turkey.\nIn the 12th minute, Ergün Penbe sent in a corner for Turkey where Ümit Davala managed to head the ball beyond goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki in what would be the only goal of the match.\nSouth Korea vs Italy.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup round of 16 match between Italy and co-hosts South Korea was played on 18 June in Daejon. In the first round, South Korea had topped their group with victories over Poland and Portugal, and a draw against the United States, while Italy struggled to advance to the second round with a victory against Ecuador, a defeat against Croatia, and a draw against Mexico, while also having several goals ruled out for offside. In the lead-up to the match, the press saw the in-form South Koreans as the favourites to win, in particular as Italy's usual starting defensive pair, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro, were both unavailable – the first due to injury and the latter due to suspension. The pre-game choreography by the Korean fans also saw supporters hold up red and white cards spelling out the words \"Again 1966\", a reference to Italy's elimination at the hands of North Korea in the first round of the 1966 World Cup. In the fifth minute of play, Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno awarded a controversial penalty for South Korea after judging Christian Panucci to have pulled down Seol Ki-hyeon in the box, but Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon saved Ahn Jung-hwan's spot kick, putting the ball out for a corner. Italy took the lead in the 19th minute after Christian Vieri headed in a Francesco Totti corner. The second half became increasingly physical, which saw several players on both teams sustain minor injuries, while Gianluca Zambrotta and Kim Nam-il were later forced off; Seol Ki-hyeon eventually managed to equalise in the 89th minute to send the match into extra-time. In the first half of extra-time, Italy were reduced to ten men after Moreno showed Totti a second yellow card for an alleged dive in South Korea's penalty area, while Moreno was 40 yards away from the play, and in the second half, Damiano Tommasi appeared to score a golden goal for Italy, but it was ruled out for offside; Ahn later scored the golden goal in the 118th minute to give the co-hosts a 2–1 victory, which allowed them to progress to the quarter-finals of the competition, the first time an Asian team had done so since 1966. Following Italy's elimination from the tournament, Moreno's performance was criticised by members of the Italian team – most notably attacking midfielder Totti and coach Giovanni Trapattoni – for several contentious decisions he had made throughout the match. Some team members even suggested a conspiracy to eliminate Italy from the competition, while Trapattoni even obliquely accused FIFA of ordering the official to ensure a Korean victory so that one of the two host nations would remain in the tournament. FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that the linesmen had been a \"disaster\" and admitted that Italy suffered from bad offside calls from the group matches, but he denied conspiracy allegations. While he criticised Totti's sending off by Moreno, Blatter refused to blame Italy's loss on the officials, stating: \"Italy's elimination is not only down to referees and linesmen who made human not premeditated errors ... Italy made mistakes both in defense and in attack.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nSpain vs South Korea.\nCo-hosts South Korea faced Spain in the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals on 22 June, in Gwangju. South Korea had progressed to the quarter-finals after defeating Italy with a golden goal, while Spain overcame Ireland in the round of 16 in a penalty shoot-out victory. In the second half of regulation time, Spanish midfielder Rubén Baraja scored from a header, but it was disallowed by referee Gamal Al-Ghandour because of alleged shirt pulling and pushing in the penalty area; a 0–0 deadlock saw the match go into extra-time. In the first half of extra-time, Spanish striker Fernando Morientes appeared to score the golden goal with a header, but the referee disallowed it after the linesman raised his flag, as he erroneously felt that the ball had gone out of play for a goal kick before being crossed in by winger Joaquín; later on in the half, Morientes came close to scoring again when he hit the post with a first-time half-volley following a throw-in. With both sides still failing to score, the match went to a penalty shoot-out; South Korea's goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae saved Joaquín's spot kick – who had been carrying an injury – while South Korea converted all of their penalties – with Hong Myung-bo scoring the decisive spot-kick – to win the shoot-out 5–3, becoming the first Asian side ever to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. However, following prior criticism in the media over the quality of officiating in South Korea's win over Italy in the round of 16, there was further controversy surrounding the contentious decisions made by the officials in South Korea's quarter-final victory, as the referee had disallowed both of Spain's goals after his linesmen Ali Tomusange and Michael Ragoonath had raised their flags. Spanish midfielder Iván Helguera, who had to be restrained after the match when he attempted to confront the referee, was particularly vocal in his criticism of the officials' decisions, stating afterwards: \"What happened here was robbery. Everyone saw two perfectly good goals. If Spain didn't win, it's because they didn't want us to win. I feel terrible about this game.\""

It is organised by the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union and is open to all eligible clubs in the Yorkshire area. It was initially known as the Yorkshire Challenge Cup.\nThe Yorkshire Senior Cup is currently the premier county cup competition for club sides based in Yorkshire that play in tier 4 (National League 2 North), tier 5 (National League 3 North) and tier 6 (North 1 East) of the English rugby union league system. The current format is as a knock-out cup with a first round, second round, quarter-final, semi-final and final, which is to be played at neutral ground in the county. Teams ranked lower than tier 6 play in the Yorkshire Shield or Yorkshire Trophy.\nHistory.\nIn 1877, despite reservations within the Rugby Football Union, the committee of the Yorkshire County Football Club (composed from the clubs of Bradford FC, Huddersfield FC, Leeds FC, Hull FC and York FC) sanctioned a knock-out tournament - the first of its kind in the UK.\nThe notion of competing for a trophy appealed to the public of Yorkshire as much as it appalled the guardians of amateurism. The proceeds from the final were distributed among local charities.The trophy itself is known as \"T'owd Tin Pot\", pronounced with a Yorkshire accent.\nIn the first season, 16 teams battled it out for the T'owd Tin Pot, with York eventually losing out to Halifax in the final.\nIn its early years the competition was dominated by clubs who now play rugby league. Since the schism of 1895 which led to the formation of the Northern Rugby Football Union and the development of rugby league football, the cup has been competed for by clubs who remained with the Rugby Football Union or were founded after 1895.\nAccording to the Hallmarks on the trophy it was made by Martin, Hall &amp; Co. Sheffield and London, in 1877. It is made of Sterling Silver .925.\nThe trophy was won by Morley Rugby Club in the two seasons prior to the Second World War, and was kept \"in a drawer under the secretary's bed\" for the duration of the war."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball postseason teams",
        "text": " \nThe Major League Baseball postseason is an elimination tournament conducted after the regular season, by which MLB determines its World Series champion for a given year.\nThe MLB postseason format has evolved throughout its history, with the number of participating teams increasing from two (for its first six-plus decades) to the current 12, with a special format in 2020 having 16. The World Series was first played in 1903, when the champions of the established National League (NL) and the upstart American League (AL) met for a playoff series. From that time through 1968, the two leagues (which each had eight teams through 1960) each sent only its team with the best regular-season record to the World Series. In 1969, as each league had expanded to 12 teams, each league was divided into East and West divisions and another playoff round was created. This round became known as the League Championship Series (LCS), with the four division champions competing for a spot in the World Series every year. This format lasted until 1993.\nIn 1994, the again-expanded leagues were re-organized into three separate divisions, and another playoff round was established, called the Division Series (DS). In this format, for each league, the champions of the East, Central, and West divisions would be joined in the playoffs by a Wild Card team. The addition of the Wild Card allowed a team that was not a division winner but still had one of the top regular-season records to enter the postseason. In 1998, the system was slightly modified so that the division winners with better regular-season records would be rewarded with homefield advantage in the division series and LCS. In 2012, the structure was adjusted such that two teams from each league receive Wild Card berths and then play a single game against each other to determine who advances to the Division Series. It also eliminated the previous restriction that the wild card team could not play a team in its own division in the first round. In 2022, the current 12-team format was used, featuring a best-of-three Wild Card Series. However, in this format, the top two division winners in each league received an automatic berth to the Division Series, while the lowest-ranked division winner and three Wild Card teams would play in the Wild Card Series.\nThree anomalies in the above-described system occurred. In 1904, the World Series did not take place because the National League champion did not wish to participate and the leagues had not yet agreed to require their champions to do so. In 1981, there was a Division Series due to a split season brought about by a midsummer player's strike. In 1994, the postseason did not take place due to a player's strike. And in 2020, after a shortened 60-game regular season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a special best-of-three Wild Card Series was played; this involved the three division winners, three second-place teams from each division, and two Wild Card teams in each league.\nFranchise records by postseason round.\nUpdated through the 2023 postseason.

        "text": "The Minto Sailing Dinghy is a sailing dinghy first produced commercially in the early 1960 and still in production.\nInitial version.\nThe Minto Sailing Dinghy began its life as a skiff for a 24-foot sloop built by Hugh Rodd at Canoe Cove on Vancouver Island. The sloop was commissioned by a Vancouver Island printer who had made some money from an investment in the Minto Mine in British Columbia, and hence he named the sloop \"Minto\". After returning from World War II in 1946 Rob Wittlesey purchased the Minto and shortly thereafter traded the skiff, with \"MINTO RVYC\" carved into its transom, to Bob Schoen of Orcas Island for a smaller dinghy.\nFirst commercial fiberglass version.\nThe Minto skiff eventually got stored in Bob's barn, where his friend Heine Dole, a NW marine architect, saw it and convinced Bob it would make a great dinghy reproduced in fiberglass. Heine took the skiff to Ed Hoppen, the Gig Harbor boat builder who was the original builder of the popular Thunderbird sailboats. After cutting out about two feet and reshaping the hull, Dole and Hoppen used the old Minto skiff as the plug for the first fiberglass Minto mold. Initially the objective was to only build five boats for themselves, Bob Schoen, and some friends. Hull number one was destroyed in trying to remove it from the mold, but hulls two through six did survive and are still in use today. As interest in the attractive little boats grew Hoppen was prompted by numerous requests to put the Minto into regular production. Ed Hoppen produced a couple hundred EDDON Boat Yard Mintos in the early 1960s, and then in the mid-1960s licensed Howard Smith, the owner of Ranger Boats in Kent, Washington, to add the Minto to his increasing line of small rowing and sailing craft. Until Ranger was sold in 1999, \"Smitty\" produced about 1000 Ranger Mintos, becoming one of the most popular and recognized yacht tenders in the NW.\nAlthough the little steamship graphic displayed on the sails of the EDDON, Ranger and Rich Passage Boats Minto dinghies implies a direct link to the SS Minto steamship that operated on Arrow Lake in British Columbia for over 50 years, the association was created by Ed and Heine. They were looking for a way to make the new little fiberglass dinghy distinctive and they thought there was a similarity to the life boats used on the SS Minto and so chose the steamship graphic for the Minto.\n2005 Revival.\nIn 2005 Rich Passage Boats, LLC of Port Orchard WA put the Minto back into production as the Rich Passage Minto, using one of the two former Ranger Minto molds. The Three Tree Point Yacht Club of Des Moines, WA has been hosting the Minto Mingle for 29 years."

        "title": "1921 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1921 Tour de France was the 15th edition of the Tour de France, taking place 26 June to 24 July. The total distance was and the average speed of the riders was 24.720 km/h. The race was won by Belgian Leon Scieur. The Belgians dominated the entire race, partly due to the absence of the French Pélissier brothers, who were on bad terms with the Tour organisation. Scieur's victory was largely uncontested; Hector Heusghem came close after the sixth stage, but lost time later. The organisation tried to get the cyclists to attack more by several means, but this failed.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe 1920 Tour de France had been dominated by Belgian cyclists, who won twelve of the fifteen stages, and the top seven of the overall classification. The French cyclists Henri and Francis Pélissier had left the 1920 Tour de France after Henri received a penalty from the Tour organisation for throwing away a tire, and they were still fighting. Therefore, the Pélissier brothers did not join the 1921 Tour de France. Two veteran cyclists who did join the race were Ernest Paul and Lucien Pothier, both forty years old. Paul rode his first Tour de France in 1908, while Pothier had started in the first Tour de France in 1903, and finished second.\nThe winner of 1920, Philippe Thys, was the dominant stage racer of the time, but he was recovering from an illness and could not compete for the victory.\nThe economic impact of World War I was still not over, so as in the previous years there were not sponsored teams, but the cycling companies had bundled their forces under the nick La Sportive. The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named \"1ère class\" (first class), the professionals, and \"2ème classe\" (second class), the amateurs. This year, some of the second class cyclists would finish higher than some of the first class cyclists.\nThe 1921 Tour de France saw the introduction of foreign press. They followed the race in their own cars.\nFor the first time, an inhabitant from Monaco joined the Tour de France. Laurent Devalle needed more than twenty-seven hours for the fifth stage, and would finally give up in the eleventh stage.\nRace overview.\nOverall, the Tour did not have any major events. This troubled the Tour organiser and newspaper owner Henri Desgrange, who sanctioned cyclists that were not combative enough in his view.\nIn the first stage, Honoré Barthélemy had to fix a flat tire eleven times. Despite this, he still finished in second place behind Louis Mottiat, with Léon Scieur in third place. In the second stage, won by Romain Bellenger, Scieur finished in second place, almost one hour before Mottiat and Barthélemy, so Scieur was leading the race. Scieur improved his lead by winning the third stage, and was already leading by 12'38\" over his closest opponent, Hector Heusghem.\nIn the fourth and fifth stage, both won by Mottiat, Scieur managed to increase his lead to almost half an hour.\nIn the sixth stage, the first real mountains were to be climbed. Hector Heusghem took off on the Tourmalet, reached the top there first, rode solo over the Aspin and the Peyresourde and finished with a 24-minute margin. This brought the difference between Scieur and Heusghem back to slightly over four minutes. The press predicted a new duel between Scieur and Heusghem.\nThe seventh and eighth stage did not change this difference. In the ninth stage the race was decided, as Heusghem lost ten minutes to Scieur. From that moment it was easy for Scieur to control the race, and the other cyclists could only ride for stage victories. In the tenth stage, Scieur punctured on the climb to Allos. It was an unwritten rule that cyclists would not attack when opponents were repairing their bicycle, but Heusghem was desperate and broke this rule. Scieur was angry, and after he completed his repair he caught back Heusghem. He then told Heusghem that this was not the way professional cyclists behaved, dropped Heusghem, and crossed the finish line first, and even added another six minutes to his lead.\nThe French crowd was pleased by the stage victory of Félix Goethals in stage eleven. In the twelfth stage Heusghem won, albeit in the same time as Scieur. Henri Desgrange was angry at the cyclists for not attempting to beat Scieur, so he had the cyclists leave separately in the thirteenth stage. The \"second class\" cyclists started two hours earlier than the sponsored \"first class\" cyclists. Although the stage was won by an unsponsored cyclist from the second class, Félix Sellier, this did not help for the general classification, as Scieur and Heusghem still finished together. The Tour organisers wanted the second class cyclists to start two hours later in the fourteenth stage, but they threatened with a strike, and the cyclists could start together. The fourteenth stage had a remarkable incident: Scieur's wheel broke, and 11 spokes were broken. According to the rules, a broken item could only be replaced when repair was not possible. Because there was no Tour official close to Scieur who could verify that the wheel was broken beyond repair, Scieur strapped the broken wheel to his back and rode with it for more than , which left scars on his back that remained there for years. In the last stage, Scieur finished a few minutes behind Heusghem, but his victory was never in danger.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nThe final general classification, calculated by adding the stages times, was won by Léon Scieur, who received 15.000 Francs. Originally, the two results of the two classes were separated, and the winner of the second class, Victor Lenaers, reportedly won 20.000 Francs in total during this race. Modern sources combine the results for the two groups.\nAftermath.\nAs in the years before, the Belgian cyclists had dominated the entire race. The French press and audience did not like this, and wanted the brothers Pélissier, who did not join because of a fight with the Tour organisers, to enter the race again. They would ultimately do this in 1923, when Henri won the race as the first French cyclist in eleven years.\nThe winner in 1921, Scieur, would start the Tour three more times, but would never win a stage again and never complete the race."

It received mixed critical reviews by various independent sources, including Canadian Online Explorer and the Pro Wrestling Torch. After its release on DVD, the event peaked at number five on \"Billboard\"'s Video Sales chart, before it fell off the chart after ten weeks.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2007 event was the 21st event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brands. The event was scheduled to be held on November 18, 2007, at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida.\nStorylines.\nSurvivor Series was the culmination of various scripted plots and storylines. For three months before the event, several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE's programming—\"Raw\", \"SmackDown!\", and \"ECW\"—to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as heroes and villains.\nThe main narrative for Survivor Series from the SmackDown! brand continued the events that unfolded at WrestleMania 23 in which The Undertaker defeated Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. Over the course of several months, the two wrestlers fought in various matches over the title, which eventually involved Edge. Undertaker was injured in one of these matches on the May 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", in which Edge had won the title after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat Undertaker. During Undertaker's absence, Edge was legitimately injured and vacated the championship, and The Great Khali won the vacant championship in a Battle Royal. At Unforgiven, Batista won the World Heavyweight Championship from Khali, and Undertaker returned from his injury. Afterwards, the original feud between the two wrestlers was restarted and culminated into a singles match for the title at Cyber Sunday; Batista won this match and retained his title. On the November 2 episode of \"SmackDown!\", a rematch was booked in a Hell in a Cell match at Survivor Series.\nThe prime rivalry from the Raw brand continued a storyline that extended from Cyber Sunday, between WWE Champion Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels over Orton's title. At Cyber Sunday, Michaels was chosen by the WWE fans, via online voting, to face Orton for the title, though, Orton retained his title via disqualification. A rematch was promoted for Survivor Series on the October 29 edition of \"Raw\", in which Michaels would face Orton for his title. Afterwards, Michaels and Orton fought in different match types over the weeks leading to Survivor Series. On the episode of \"Raw\" before Survivor Series, Michaels and Orton met \"Face to Face\", in which Orton attacked Michaels.\nThe prime storyline on the ECW brand featured ECW Champion CM Punk, John Morrison, and The Miz. Morrison and Punk's rivalry revolved over the outcome of their match at , in which Morrison (then known as Johnny Nitro) defeated Punk to win the vacant title. Punk sought revenge, but Morrison defeated Punk in two championship matches at The Great American Bash and SummerSlam; however, Punk won the title from Morrison on the September 4 episode of \"ECW\". At Cyber Sunday, Miz was voted online by fans to challenge Punk for the ECW Championship, though, Punk defeated Miz to retain his title. A Triple Threat match was announced for Survivor Series on the November 13 episode of \"ECW\", in which Punk would defend his title against Morrison and Miz, and the first wrestler to gain a pinfall or submission would win the match and the title.\nIn a narrative extending to the September 10 episode of \"Raw\", in which Hornswoggle, a dwarf, was announced as Vince McMahon's illegitimate son. In this storyline, McMahon did not like the fact that Hornswoggle was his son, and as a result, he promoted matches in which Hornswoggle faced much larger opponents. As part of this storyline, McMahon announced that The Great Khali would face Hornswoggle at Survivor Series. In a promotional in-ring segment on the episode of \"SmackDown!\" before the pay-per-view event, Khali and Hornswoggle weighed in for their match, in which Khali weighed double the weight of Hornswoggle; this was a segment created by McMahon to humiliate his son. The event included an inter-brand 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Announced via WWE.com, WWE's official website, Team Triple H (Triple H, The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), Rey Mysterio, and Kane) would face Team Umaga (Umaga, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), Finlay, Big Daddy V, and Mr. Kennedy).\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view began with the ECW Championship Triple Threat match, in which CM Punk defended the title against John Morrison and The Miz. Throughout the match, The Miz and Morrison double-teamed Punk, however, Miz turned on Morrison by attacking him. After Miz threw Morrison out of the ring, Punk performed a Go To Sleep on Miz to retain the ECW Championship.\nThe next scheduled match was an inter-brand 10-Diva tag team match, in which the team of Kelly Kelly, Torrie Wilson, Mickie James, Maria, and Michelle McCool faced Victoria, Beth Phoenix, Melina, Layla, and Jillian Hall. Phoenix's team had the advantage over James' team, until James was tagged into the match. She delivered a Clothesline and a Long Kiss Goodnight to Melina to earn the victory for her team.\nNext was a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship, in which the champions, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defended against Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes. At one point, Holly performed a Clothesline on Cade, and sent Cade and himself onto ringside. In the ring, Murdoch performed the \"Ace of Spades\" on Rhodes to retain the World Tag Team Championship for his team.\nThe fourth match was the five-on-four Survivor Series Elimination Tag team match between Team Triple H (Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio, and Kane) and Team Umaga (Umaga, Mr. Kennedy, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay, and Big Daddy V). Before the event, it was announced that Matt Hardy would be unable to compete in the match due to a scripted injury. Kane was the first wrestler eliminated after an elbow drop by Big Daddy V. Umaga then eliminated Mysterio after the \"Samoan Spike. MVP was eliminated by Hardy after a Twist of Fate. Kennedy was eliminated by Triple H after Big Daddy V accidentally performed an elbow drop on Kennedy. Big Daddy V was eliminated after Hardy and Triple H performed a Double DDT. Finlay and Umaga were then eliminated after a \"Pedigree\" to Finlay, and a \"Swanton\" to Umaga. As a result, Team Triple H won.\nThe Great Khali faced Hornswoggle in the next scheduled match. At one point, Hornswoggle tried to hit Khali with a shillelagh, but Khali slapped Hornswoggle down to the mat. The match ended via disqualification, after Finlay, Hornswoggle's original caretaker, entered the ring and hit Khali in the head with his own shillelagh and Finlay turned face.\nMain event matches.\nThe sixth match was Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship against Shawn Michaels. In the match, Michaels was banned from using \"Sweet Chin Music\", while Orton was unable to get disqualified, and if either man broke those stipulations they would have lost the match. If Shawn Michaels used his finishing move, he would’ve never been allowed to challenge for the WWE championship again no matter who held the championship following this match. Michaels attempted various submission moves, such as the Sharpshooter, Crossface, and ankle lock. Eventually, Michaels attempted to perform Sweet Chin Music but to prevent himself from losing the match, he stopped, which then allowed Orton to perform an RKO to retain the WWE Championship.\nThe main event was Batista defending the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista performed a Batista Bomb through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Batista for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed another Tombstone Piledriver on top of the steel steps and pinned Batista, but as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker's head on top of the steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair onto The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Edge came back into the ring and hit The Undertaker with a chair as he was sitting up.\nReception.\nThe American Airlines Arena usually has a capacity of 19,600, which was reduced for Survivor Series due to production purposes. From an approximate attendance of 12,000 and 341,000 pay-per-view buys, Survivor Series helped WWE earn $19.9 million in pay-per-view revenue versus $18.7 million the previous year; this was confirmed by WWE in its 2007 fourth quarter financial report. Although Survivor Series helped WWE's revenue, it earned 42,000 less buys than the previous year's Survivor Series.\nIn addition, the pay-per-view received mixed reviews. Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk of Canadian Online Explorer's \"SLAM! Sports – Wrestling\" rated the entire event 7.5 out of 10 points. They also rated Raw and SmackDown's main event an 8 out of 10 points. J.D. Dunn of 411Mania stated that the event was \"The best WWE PPV since Backlash.\" Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch, a professional wrestling newsletter operated since 1987, reported that the main event was \"disappointing\" and that \"WWE set expectations too high for the Cell.\" He rated the Raw main event 3 out of 5 points, while rating the SmackDown main event 2.25 out of 5 points. Survivor Series was released on DVD on December 26, 2007, by WWE Home Video, and it was distributed by Genius Products. The DVD debuted on \"Billboard's\" Video Sales chart on January 19, 2008, at number five. It spent nine more weeks on the chart, before it fell off the chart at number 20.\nAftermath.\nAfter Survivor Series, Randy Orton was scripted into a feud with Chris Jericho, who made his return to WWE after a two-year hiatus. The following night on \"Raw\", the evolving feud culminated into a match being promoted for Armageddon, WWE's December pay-per-view. At Armageddon, Orton retained his WWE Title. After Batista retained his World Heavyweight Championship, Edge was scripted into a rivalry with him over his title. Eventually, The Undertaker was also placed in the feud, which led to the advertising of a Triple Threat match at Armageddon for the title. At Armageddon, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to the events that occurred at Survivor Series, a match was announced between Finlay and The Great Khali for Armageddon. Finlay prevailed at Armageddon via pinning The Great Khali. After surviving their Elimination tag team match, Triple H and Jeff Hardy were promoted into a match for Armageddon, in which the winner would win the opportunity to challenge for the WWE Championship. At Armageddon, Hardy defeated Triple H. Because Beth Phoenix and Mickie James were the leaders of their teams at Survivor Series, a feud evolved from this, which culminated into a match at Armageddon over Phoenix's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix retained her title at Armageddon.\nThis was the last Survivor Series PPV to air in 4:3 format until January 2008 when all WWE shows went in high definition."

He is the 2nd-most capped lock, and formed one of the most famous lock pairings in international rugby, often partnered with Robin Brooke in the All Blacks from 1992 to 1998. What Jones lacked in size he more than made up for in skill, Jones was picked over physically intimidating locks such as Mark Cooksley who was the tallest All Black ever. Jones made his All Black debut Saturday, 16 June 1990 v Scotland at Dunedin. At the time he was 23 years, 60 days old.\nJones had an impressive start with a try on debut. Coincidentally six years later Jones played his 50th test, again at Carisbrook and again with Scotland the opponent. He scored at virtually the same exact spot in the stadium as he did six years before. Throughout his impressive career Jones was renowned for his ability in line-outs.\nIn the Super 12 Jones made 38 appearances, often as captain, for the Chiefs between 1996 and 1999. He once scored three tries in a match, against the Waratahs in 1996. In 1998 he was handed a lengthy suspension after a stomping incident involving the Hurricanes' Jason O'Halloran.\nJones started his career with Northland in 1988 as a string bean 20-year-old lock who was tipped for big things back then. He picked up the nickname \"Kamo\" after his home town just north of Whangārei in New Zealand's Northland region.\nIn total Jones played 105 matches for the All Blacks including 79 tests. Jones was named captain for one match. Jones scored a total of 14 tries in All Blacks matches with nine of those in test matches.\nRetirement.\nJones now works as a television rugby commentator for Sky Sports and presented their now defunct programme 'RugbyThentre'.\nIn the 2010 New Year Honours, Jones was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to rugby."

        "text": "World Cup 98 is a football video game released in 1998 to coincide with that year's FIFA World Cup football tournament, developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts under their EA Sports label. It is the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997. Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, \"World Cup 98\" used a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version. \nAccurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game engine is based on that of \"\", though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as in-game strategy changing and player positioning. The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals. \n\"World Cup 98\" was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Nintendo 64. A version developed by Tiertex Design Studios and published by THQ was also released for the Game Boy. The intro song to the game is Chumbawamba's \"Tubthumping.\"\nGame modes.\nThe main feature of the game is the World Cup tournament itself, where the player may use either the actual groups used in the finals, or groups composed of a random selection of the 40 included teams. Each match takes place in a recreation of the venue it was played in the actual tournament. As in the real tournament, group games do not go to extra time or a penalty shootout but knockout matches do.\nThe game was released prior to the actual World Cup, therefore results between CPU teams are not based on results from the actual tournament. At the end of each match, a caption shows the man of the match award, and if applicable a clean sheet caption. At the end of the \"World Cup\" game mode, captions show the winner of the Golden Boot for most goals scored during the tournament and winner of the FIFA Fair Play Award, two awards which are given in the real World Cup.\nIt is also possible to play friendly matches between any of the teams that are included in the game. At the end of a drawn game the player can choose to finish the match as a draw, play extra time with the golden goal rule, or take part in a penalty shootout.\nAs in \"FIFA 98\", national squads can be customised to reflect the actual tournament's players by including players from a reserves pool in the \"customise\" option.\nThe \"World Cup Classics\" mode allows the player to play fifteen classic FIFA World Cup matches. The 1982 match is unlocked by winning the \"World Cup\" mode, and by completing each unlocked game, the next one is unlocked in the order shown below. \"World Cup Classics\" mode features accurate period team kits (except for the goalies), hairstyles and names, and commentary for this mode only was provided by Kenneth Wolstenholme, the BBC's commentator during the 1966 and 1970 FIFA World Cup. For the 1950, 1954, and 1966 World Cup Final matches in this mode, the graphics are in black and white, as they were shown on television at the time. The 1930 and 1938 matches are shown using sepia tone graphics. In matches that took place prior to the introduction of substitutions, it is not possible to change a player during the match (however, this also applies to the 1970 final, which was when substitutions became the rule). Other historical inaccuracies include cards being awarded to players in matches prior to 1970 and the use of brown leather balls for matches from 1970 onwards, in lieu of balls like the Adidas Telstar (for 1970 and 1974) and the Adidas Tango España (for the 1982 final). The United Kingdom version of the game features commentary from John Motson and Chris Waddle, with matches introduced by Des Lynam and Gary Lineker.\nTeams.\nThe game features every team that qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as well as eight others who did not: Australia, Canada, China, Greece, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Russia and Sweden. All teams are featured with their authentic kits.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1996, EA Sports obtained exclusive rights to use the 1998 World Cup in video games published anywhere except Japan.\nReception.\nThe game received favourable reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. \"Next Generation\" said of the PlayStation version, \"Released to coincide with the recent World Cup frenzy, Electronic Arts' \"World Cup 98\" is technically a winner. The game delivers fast reactions to controller commands, realistic player movement, clean graphics, an excellent soundtrack, and adrenaline-pumping excitement.\" In Japan, where the same console version was ported and published by Electronic Arts Square under the name of on 5 November 1998, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 30 out of 40.\nJeff Lackey of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" gave the PC version all fives stars, saying, \"If you don't have \"FIFA 98\", the decision is clear—if you are a soccer fan, or any type of computer sports fan at all, you will love \"World Cup 98\". If you have \"FIFA 98\", the decision is a bit trickier as the improvements are subtle but significant—you will likely find the improved player and goalie AI and the wonderful recreation of the World Cup atmosphere well worth the price of admission.\" Warren Christmas of \"PC Zone\" gave the same PC version 91%, saying, \"\"World Cup 98\" is quite simply the finest football game on the PC; the perfect accompaniment to the tournament. Not so meat and gravy, then, as a succulent chicken in white wine sauce (or something). Gorge yourself on it.\" Brad Cook of \"AllGame\" gave the same PC version four stars out of five, saying, \"Overall, you'll love this game if you're a soccer fan and [you] will still enjoy it even if you like sports games but aren't a big soccer player. Novice players will find it easy to play (scoring goals isn't very hard on amateur level) while experts will like the wealth of options available for them to play with.\" However, \"Edge\" gave the same PC version seven out of ten, saying, \"Ultimately, \"WC '98\"s basic core of gameplay remains unchanged. For \"\" owners, it's a purchase for the completist or the extravagant; for the uninitiated few, an opportunity to see a commercially evergreen franchise in rare form.\"\nCam Shea of \"Hyper\" gave the N64, PlayStation and PC versions each 90%, calling the game \"a superb game, but think twice if you already own \"FIFA 98\".\" James Ashton of \"N64 Magazine\" gave the N64 version 73%, calling it a \"highly desirable license, [but a] flawed game.\"\nAir Hendrix of \"GamePro\" said of the Nintendo 64 version, \"Although \"World Cup\"s a better-playing game than \"FIFA\", it has less variety, and its refinements aren't exactly huge. Casual soccer gamers should definitely rent before springing for another game—especially since the release of \"International Superstar Soccer 98\" is just around the corner, and who knows how that'll score.\" The Rookie of the same magazine said of the PlayStation version, \"When the final whistle sounds, \"World Cup '98\" is an extremely fun and challenging soccer game, and one of the best on the market. While some excellent improvements have been made over the recently released \"\", if you already own that title (and unless you're a total soccer nut), you probably won't need to make another soccer purchase.\"\nThe PlayStation version was a bestseller in the UK. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \"Gold\" prize for revenues above €48 million in the European Union during the previous year. \"PC Guide\"'s July 1998 issue named \"World Cup 98\" as the winner of a group test involving other PC football games around at the same time, ahead of competitors such as \"Actua Soccer 2\", \"Three Lions\" and \"Sensible Soccer '98\". The magazine described the game as \"Simply the best football game in the world.\"\nThe PC version was a finalist for \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" 1998 \"Sports Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"Grand Prix Legends\". The staff called the game \"superb, a tour de force of soccer simulation.\" Likewise, the same PC version won the \"Best Sports\" award (along with \"FIFA: Road to World Cup 98\" and \"FIFA 99\", collectively) at \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1999 Premier Awards."

He also played in the 1980 NHL All-Star Game.\nBiography.\nMcEwen was born in Hornepayne, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1968 and 1969 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with minor ice hockey teams from Toronto.\nAn offensive-minded defenseman, McEwen was selected by the New York Rangers in the 1976 NHL Draft. His talents immediately paid dividends as he helped guide the Rangers to the finals in 1979. His tenure with the Rangers would not last long as he was traded to the Colorado Rockies in the giant trade that sent Barry Beck to New York.\nHis stay with the Rockies was short-lived as he would frequently clash with head coach Don Cherry, and he was eventually traded to the New York Islanders in the deal that sent Steve Tambellini and Chico Resch to the Rockies. The trade would soon pay off for the Islanders as his offensive talents helped them in three of their Stanley Cup championships, in 1981, 1982 and 1983.\nMcEwen would also play for the Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals, Detroit Red Wings and Hartford Whalers before his NHL career ended following the 1987–88 season.\nMcEwen was the first coach of the Oklahoma City Blazers, whom he coached to three consecutive playoff appearances in 1992-93, 1993–94, and 1994–95.\nMcEwen currently resides in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was heavily involved in daily operations of Kids First a program designed to open hockey up to youth of all ages. Additionally McEwen held various positions within the Oklahoma Youth Hockey Association, to include House program director and Youth Travel Team Coach. McEwen is no longer involved in Oklahoma City Youth Hockey, after a disagreement with the Association.\nMcEwen most recently held the position as the Parks and Recreation Director for the City of Del City. https://www.centraloklahomaweeklies.com/2020/11/25/del-city-leaders-putting-focus-on-customer-service/\nLegacy.\nIn the 2009 book \"100 Ranger Greats\", the authors ranked McEwen at No. 98 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team's first 82 seasons."

He batted and threw right-handed.\nPitching career.\nFisher played for collegiate baseball for three seasons for the Oklahoma Sooners. Fisher led Pacific Coast League pitchers with 239 innings while playing for the Tacoma Giants in 1960. His minor league record from 1958 to 1961 was 47-28 (.627) with a 3.23 ERA in 93 games (632 innings pitched).\nFisher's best pitch was the knuckleball, and in 1963-1966 he worked out of the White Sox bullpen with fellow flutterball specialist Hoyt Wilhelm.\nFisher started just 63 out of the 690 games he appeared in, and completed 7 of those, two for shutouts. He is better-known, however, for his effective relief work.\nIn Fisher's 15-year career, 1965 stands out as his best season. He was named to the American League All-Star team and finished 4th in the MVP voting. He pitched the final two innings of the 1965 All-Star Game for the AL, holding the National League scoreless on one hit. He retired Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente and Ron Santo in order in the top of the ninth.\nFisher led the league that season in WHIP (0.974), games pitched (82), and games finished (60), and was second in earned run average (2.40) and saves (24). His 15-7 record gave him a winning percentage of .682, which ranked fourth. The White Sox finished in second place that year with a record of 95-67.\nHe was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on June 13, 1966 and helped them win the American League pennant. In 44 appearances for the O's he was 5-3 with 13 saves and a 2.64 ERA in 71.2 innings. Baltimore won the 1966 World Series, although Fisher did not appear in any of the four games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and Dave McNally all pitched complete games, and the team needed only one relief appearance, provided by Moe Drabowsky. \nFisher spent the 1968 season with the Alvin Dark-managed Cleveland Indians after being acquired along with minor leaguers Johnny Scruggs and Bob Scott from the Orioles for John O'Donoghue and Gordon Lund on November 28, 1967. He later pitched for the California Angels. He was released by the Cardinals on October 26, 1973.\nCareer totals include a record of 85-70 with 81 saves. In 1538.2 innings pitched he had 812 strikeouts, an ERA of 3.41, and a low 1.193 WHIP. He had a lifetime batting average of just .122 (30-for-246), but did once have three hits in a game, on September 19, 1960 vs. the Chicago Cubs. He currently ranks 92nd on the MLB All-Time Games Pitched List (690) and 72nd on the MLB All-Time Games Finished List (344)."

        "title": "1919 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1919 Tour de France was the 13th edition, taking place from 29 June to 27 July covering a total distance of . It was the first Tour de France after World War I, and was won by Firmin Lambot. Following the tenth stage, the yellow jersey, given to the leader of the general classification, was introduced, and first worn by Eugène Christophe.\nThe fighting in World War I had ravaged the French road system, which made cycling difficult. As a result, the average speed (24.056 km/h) and the number of finishing cyclists (ten) were the lowest in history.\nBackground.\nSince the previous Tour de France in 1914, it was impossible to organize the Tour de France due to World War I. Tour organizer Henri Desgrange always wanted to organize a Tour after the war, and within days after the end of the war, the organization of the 1919 Tour de France started.\nInnovations and changes.\nThree former winners of the Tour, François Faber, Octave Lapize and Lucien Petit-Breton had died fighting in the war. Two other former winners, Philippe Thys and Odile Defraye started the race. The war had been over for only seven months, so most cyclists did not have a chance to train for the Tour. For that reason, there were almost no new younger cyclists, and the older cyclists dominated the race. The organization did not make it easy for the cyclists: with the addition of a stop at Strasbourg (recently recovered in the war), the length was extended to 5560 km: longer than all the previous Tours. Since then only the 1926 Tour de France has been longer.\nThe bicycle manufacturers also suffered from the war and were unable to sponsor teams of cyclists. They worked together and sponsored more than half of the cyclists under the name \"La Sportive\", but effectively all the cyclists rode as individuals, wearing grey jerseys. The lack of team colours made riders indistinguishable and lead to the introduction of the leader's jersey. Cyclists were divided in an A-category (professional) and a B-category (amateurs).\nIn previous years, cyclists had to take care of their own food during the race. In 1919, the tour organisation took care of this.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was won by Belgian Jean Rossius. However, he was penalised 30 minutes for illegally helping Philippe Thys (handing him a water bottle), therefore giving Henri Pélissier the lead in the race. It did not helped Thys however, because he had to abandon the race in the first stage after a large crash.\nIn the beginning of the race, Henri and Francis Pélissier were the best. They both finished before the rest in stage two, with Henri crossing the line first. In the third stage, Henri, leading the race, wanted to stop. Organizer Desgrange did all he could to change Pélissier's mind, and finally Pélissier started to race again. He was already 45 minutes behind, and the next three hours he was chasing the rest. He finally caught up, and finished second in the sprint, after his brother Francis. After that victory, Henri Pélissier said that he was a thoroughbred and the rest of the cyclists were work horses, which made the other cyclists angry. During that third stage, Léon Scieur punctured four times, and lost two hours.\nIn the fourth stage, the rest of the cyclists (only 25 were still in race) took revenge on the Pélissier brothers. When they had to change bicycles, everybody else sped away from them. Henri Pélissier chased the rest, but was then ordered by Desgrange to stop working together with other cyclists in his pursuit. In the end, Henri Pélissier had lost more than 35 minutes, and his brother Francis over three hours. The Pélissier brothers were angry at the organisation and left the race. Jean Alavoine won the stage, and Eugène Christophe became the new leader in the general classification.\nAlavoine would also win the fifth stage, the longest ever in history at .\nChristophe was still in Grenoble at the start of stage eleven, when, at 2am tour organiser Henri Desgrange gave him a yellow jersey, so that he could easily be recognized. The colour was inspired by the colour of the organizing newspaper l'Auto, although another explanation is that other colours were not available in the post-war shortage. Previously the leader would wear a green armband. Christophe was not happy with his yellow jersey, and other cyclists called him a canary. At that point in the race, it was likely that Christophe would stay the leader until the end of the Tour de France, because he remained in that yellow jersey after the Pyrenees and the Alps. In the penultimate stage, Firmin Lambot, who was in second position, more than 28 minutes behind, attacked. Christophe, still leading the race, chased him, but broke his fork close to Valenciennes. The rules were such that cyclists could get no help at all, so Christophe repaired his bicycle himself. This same thing had already cost him the victory in 1913, and would happen to him for a third time in 1922. It took him over two and a half hours, and he had lost the lead to Lambot. In the last stage, Christophe had a record number of punctures, and also lost his second place to Jean Alavoine.\nLambot, aged 33, was at that moment the oldest Tour de France winner in history.\nBecause the organising newspaper l'Auto felt bad for Christophe, he received the same prize money as the winner Lambot. In addition, a collection raised money, the donors for this prize were reported in 20 pages in the newspaper. Altogether, Christophe received 13310 Francs, much more than the 5000 Francs that Lambot received for his victory.\nResults.\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader. From the eleventh stage on, the leader in the general classification was identified by the yellow jersey.\nGeneral classification.\nOf the 67 cyclists that started the race, only 11 cyclists finished. On 12 August 1919, Paul Duboc (8th overall), was disqualified for borrowing a car to go and repair his pedal axle, which left only 10 cyclists in the final classification.\nIn total, 43 cyclists started as category A, and 24 cyclists as category B.\nAftermath.\nThe yellow jersey that was introduced in this tour, was so successful that it has been used ever since. Thys claimed to have worn the first yellow jersey when leading in 1913: Desgrange had requested him to wear a distinguishable coloured jersey, so his team manager found him a yellow jersey. The winner of the race, Lambot, would later also win the 1922 Tour de France, but has become a half-forgotten figure in the Tour's history.\nThe fight between cyclist Pélissier and tour organiser Desgrange would continue for many years. Pélissier would win the 1923 Tour de France."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1901 to 1919 for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Naps / Indians, and Philadelphia Athletics.\nBiography.\nListed at , 149 lb., Turner was basically a line-drive hitter and a fearless base stealer. Because normal slides hurt his ankles, he pioneered the use of the head-first slide. As a fielder, he spent most of his playing time between shortstop and third base. He also broke up three no-hitters and spoiled a perfect game effort by Chief Bender after receiving a fourth-inning walk.\nIn 1904 Turner started a long tenure with Cleveland that lasted 15 years, appearing in a team-record 1,619 games. He hit a career-high .308 in 1912, and from 1906 to 1911 averaged 25.5 steals in each season, with a career-high 31 in 1910. On the field, he led the American League shortstops in fielding percentage four times. He also ranks among the top 10 Cleveland players in seven different offensive categories and still the team-mark in putouts with 4,603. For over seventy-seven years, Turner also held the Indians' team record for the most career stolen bases with 254. His record was broken by Kenny Lofton in 1996, and has since also been surpassed by Omar Vizquel, who did so in 2003.\nIn a 17-season career, Turner was a .253 hitter (1499-for-5921) with eight home runs and 528 RBI in 1659 games, including 699 runs, 207 doubles, 77 triples, and 256 stolen bases.\nTurner died in Cleveland, Ohio, at the age of 79. He was buried at Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.\nIn 2001, he was selected to the 100 Greatest Indians Roster, as part of the club's 100th Anniversary Celebration."

This article deals chiefly with ice hockey.\nThe National Hockey League defines it in Rule 55 as \"the act of using the stick in a manner that enables a player or goalkeeper to restrain an opponent.\"\nHooking in the rules.\nThe NHL covers hooking in Rule 55, which defines it as \"the act of using the stick in a manner that enables a player or goalkeeper to restrain an opponent.\" It goes on to specify that \"when a player is checking another in such a way that there is only stick-to-stick contact, such action is not to be penalized as hooking.\" The NHL groups hooking with other \"Restraining fouls\" such as holding, interference and tripping.\nThe IIHF covers hooking in Rule 533, defining a player guilty of hooking as one \"who impedes or seeks to impede the progress of an opponent by hooking him with the stick.\"\nBoth codes allow for hooking to be penalized with either a minor or major penalty; the latter is imposed for injuring an opponent by hooking, and carries with it an automatic game misconduct.\nEmphasis in NHL.\nFollowing the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NHL made \"Zero tolerance on Interference, Hooking and Holding/Obstruction\" its top priority for game officials. Since that time the league and its officials have made a significant effort to follow up on that priority, and the game is being played in a more open style as a result."

It features all 28 MLB teams that existed at the time. However, the only license the game has is the MLBPA license. This means that while the game does feature actual players, there are no team names or logos. The teams wear uniforms without logos and are only named by their city (the teams that share the cities of Chicago and New York are separated by having either an A or N after their name, denoting their league).\nThe main menu theme is a cover of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\".\nModes.\nPre-season.\nThis is a single exhibition game between any two teams. The player can face the computer, play against another player, or let the computer go at it. In addition, there is the coach option, which allows the player to act as a manager. In this mode, the player selects what kind of pitches will be thrown and what kind of batting swings will be taken, but then lets the computer execute the actions.\nRegular season.\nThe player selects the status of all 28 teams (play, coach, watch, or skip) and goes through a complete season (the schedule is based on the 1994 season), ending with the playoffs and finally the World Championship Series. Along the way, stats are kept for every team and player in the league.\nSuper Stars.\nA game can be played between the Super Star teams (a copyright-free name for the All-Star teams). Players can use either the All-Star teams from 1993 or draft their own team.\nTeam data.\nHere, players can view all of the players' statistics from 1993, as well as their statistics for the game's current season, if one is in progress.\nReception.\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 23 out of 40. \"GamePro\" called it \"a statistics-filled gaming experience that also generates some real excitement.\" They complimented the large number of options, the high degree of control over the game, and the rendition of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", though they felt that most of the game's music was mediocre."

Díaz was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2006, becoming the fifth Puerto Rican ever drafted by the NBA and the eighth to play there. He has also played professionally in Europe and in Puerto Rico.\nBiography.\nUniversity of Miami.\nDiaz had a stellar college career at the University of Miami, where he earned All-American status. At the University of Miami, he finished 10th on the school's all-time scoring list with 1,477 points, including 174 three-point field goals. He garnered All-Big East Team Freshman First Team honors in 2003–04 and led Miami in scoring as both a sophomore and a junior. He was named to the All-ACC Team in both his sophomore and junior years.\nLos Angeles Clippers.\nDiaz declared his eligibility for the NBA draft following his junior year and was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers, with the 52nd overall selection in the 2006 NBA draft. During the summers of 2006 and 2007, Diaz participated with the team in the NBA Summer Pro League.\nOn August 16, 2007, Diaz signed a non-guaranteed contract with the Los Angeles Clippers to 3 years $2 million, according to HOOPSHYPE.com. On October 25, Diaz was released at the conclusion of preseason, signing a free agent contract with the Anaheim Arsenal of the NBDL. Through January 8, 2008, Diaz averaged 16.6 points per game in 14 games, with 7 starts.\nOn January 8, 2008, Diaz was signed to a 10-day contract with the Clippers, in which he debuted against the Phoenix Suns playing 5 minutes and registering 1 rebound. On January 18, the Clippers extended his contract for an additional 10 days. Through 6 games played in the NBA, Diaz scored 5 points, grabbed 2 rebounds, and dished 1 assist in 18 minutes played. The contract was terminated on January 28, when the team decided not to offer a guaranteed contract for the remainder of the season.\nNBA Summer League 2008.\nGuillermo Diaz was included on the Summer League roster of the Charlotte Bobcats for the NBA Summer League 2008.\nOverseas career.\nFor the 2006–07 season he played for ČEZ Basketball Nymburk in the Czech basketball league. On January 7, 2007, El Nuevo Dia reported that Diaz would not return for the second half of the season, as stated by mentor Arturo Alvarez, as Diaz wasn't able to adapt to the different lifestyle that he experienced in the Czech Republic. By the time that Diaz decided to leave the Czech league, he was the second leading scorer in the whole league, with an average of 20.1 points per game, and had led Nymburk to a 15–1 season start in the Czech League.\nDiaz also played in five games with AEP Olimpiada Patron in the Greek League in 2007, tallying 13.0 points per game.\nIn February 2008, he signed for Pepsi Caserta, a team in the LegADue, now known as Serie A2 Basket, the second division of Italian professional basketball. He helped them win the championship in the 2008 season. For winning they were promoted to the Italian top-tier level LBA in the 2008–09 season.\nControversy with National Superior Basketball.\nAfter his departing from the Czech national league, Diaz announced that he was interested in including his name to the list of players in the Puerto Rican BSN draft. He was involved in a movement that was trying to convince the team owners of the league to avoid the implementation of a salary cap to first-year players.\nHowever, the team owners decided to put in cap on salary of twenty five thousand dollars, which led Diaz to remove his name from the list of players. This led former owner Miguel Mercado to create a movement inciting first-year players to withdraw their names from the draft; the controversy reached a conclusion, when Mercado and the league reached an agreement. Diaz announced that he was going to skip participation in any league, and continued his participation in the Clippers Summer League team.\nReal Estelí.\nDiaz played with Nicaraguan club Real Estelí in the 2021–22 BCL Americas.\nCareer stats.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "text": "Chris Walker (born 27 February 1980) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played mostly in the 2000s. A Queensland State of Origin representative winger, he played his club football in the National Rugby League for the Brisbane Broncos, South Sydney, Sydney Roosters, Melbourne Storm, Gold Coast Titans and Parramatta. Walker also had a stint in the Super League for French club Catalans Dragons. He is the younger brother of fellow professional NRL players Shane Walker and Ben Walker. At one point in the late 1990s, all three brothers were playing together for the Brisbane Broncos.\nBackground.\nBorn in Brisbane, Queensland on 27 February 1980. Walker was educated St. Mary's College, Toowoomba, where he represented 1996 Australian Schoolboys.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nWalker started his career playing for the Past Brothers club in the Queensland Cup.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nWhile playing for Past Brothers, Walker also played for the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League.\nHe made his first-grade debut for Brisbane against Cronulla-Sutherland in round 2 of 1999. In the 2000 NRL season, Walker played 10 games for Brisbane but did not play in their premiership-winning team in that year's grand final.\nHaving won the 2000 NRL Premiership, Brisbane travelled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Walker selected for the interchange bench in Brisbane's loss.\nIn his final year with the club, Walker (along with Lote Tuqiri and Darren Lockyer), he was the top try-scorer for the Broncos in the 2002 season.\nSouth Sydney Rabbitohs.\nAfter leaving Brisbane, Walker started the 2003 NRL season at South Sydney. However, he played only five games for the club before requesting a release from his contract, citing personal reasons. At the time Walker was on $350,000 salary with Souths. In 2015, Walker spoke to the media about his time at the Rabbitohs and revealed he had been sent death threats after walking out on the team by fans. Walker said, \"Yes, I had about seven or eight letters. I still don't why or who sent them. The worst one was when I received a letter from someone saying they were going to shoot me. I went to the game thinking I was going to die.\"\nSydney Roosters.\nAfter leaving Souths mid-season, Walker joined the club's arch-rivals, the Sydney Roosters. \nWalker was a try-scorer in the Roosters' loss in the 2003 NRL Grand Final against Penrith.\nDuring this period of his career, Walker gained a reputation as a \"bad boy\" of rugby league. In the 2004 NRL season, he was involved in a drunken altercation with police outside a Fortitude Valley nightclub, prompting the Roosters management to fine the winger and place him on an alcohol ban for the rest of the season. He returned to play on the wing and score a try for the Roosters in their 2004 NRL Grand Final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, Canterbury-Bankstown.\nMelbourne Storm.\nAfter departing the Sydney Roosters following the conclusion of the 2005 NRL season, Walker signed for the Melbourne Storm. However, in August 2006, Walker was sacked by Melbourne for disciplinary reasons.\nIn 2019, Walker spoke about his dismissal from Melbourne, and also his departure from the Sydney Roosters, saying, \"I had a bit of a disagreement with 'Sticky' [Roosters coach Ricky Stuart] at the end of 2005. I’d been getting on the drink pretty heavy and my relationship [with television actress Kate Ritchie] was falling to bits. I signed with Melbourne, and it was the same thing down there. I didn’t curb my ways off the field, and that didn’t fit in with their culture. The disagreement between [Storm coach] Craig Bellamy and myself was brought on by me being irresponsible off the field.\"\nGold Coast Titans.\nIn November 2006, it was announced that Walker had been given a trial with the newly established Gold Coast Titans. In early March 2007, after a series of strong performances in pre-season trial matches for the Titans, Walker signed a one-year deal with the Gold Coast club for their inaugural season in the NRL. In club's first-ever NRL premiership game, Walker scored two tries, but then broke a bone in his hand early in the second half.\nIn April 2007, while sidelined with injury, Walker was reported to have been ejected from a bar for \"bad behaviour\". The Gold Coast Titans suspended him as a result and it was later revealed that Walker had been suffering from alcoholism and an anxiety disorder. After a period of rehabilitation and several games in the lower-tier Queensland Cup, Walker returned to the NRL in Round 19 against Canterbury.\nIn 2008, Walker suffered a season-ending ruptured Achilles tendon for the second time in five months, necessitating a lengthy spell on the sidelines. In 2009, he attracted interest from Super League clubs, but said he did not want to play in Europe and he would prefer to stay in the NRL with a Queensland team. \nCatalans Dragons.\nUnable to secure a desirable contract in the NRL, Walker signed a two-year deal with the Catalans Dragons in France, to commence in 2010.\nParramatta Eels.\nWalker spent only one season with Catalans and returned to the NRL in 2011 to play with the Parramatta Eels. However, after only six games and a string of injuries, he approached Parramatta officials for permission leave the club and retired from the NRL at the end of the 2011 season.\nIpswich Jets.\nWalker ultimately returned to playing, signing with Ipswich Jets in the Queensland Cup. Under the co-coaching of his brothers Ben and Shane, he played in the 2015 NRL State Championship final where Ipswich defeated Newcastle.\nRepresentative career.\nWalker played for Queensland in all six State of Origin matches in 2001 and 2002. Walker scored tries in all three games of the 2001 State of Origin series."

For the 2008 season, Murphy played in 108 games batting .275 with 15 home runs and 74 RBI.\n2009.\nIn 2009, Murphy played in 128 games batting .269 with 17 home runs and 57 RBI.\n2010.\nIn 2010, Murphy played in 138 games batting .291 with 12 home runs and 65 RBI. His efforts led to the Rangers entering the World Series for the first time in franchise history but the team would eventually lose the series to the San Francisco Giants.\n2011.\nOn opening day against the Boston Red Sox, Murphy hit a go-ahead, pinch-hit two-run double in the eighth inning that put the Rangers up, 7–5. Texas went on to win that game, 9–5. Two days later, in his first start of the season, he hit a home run against Clay Buchholz.\nDuring the 120 games Murphy played in during the 2011 season, he batted .275 and finished with 11 home runs and 46 RBI. In Game 7 of the 2011 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Murphy was the final out of the series, flying out to Allen Craig in left field. Murphy's out resulted in the Rangers losing their second straight World Series appearance.\n2012.\nMurphy finished the 2012 season with a .304 batting average while slugging 15 home runs and 61 RBI in 147 games. His 4.0 WAR was the highest mark of his career.\n2013.\nMurphy began the season as the starting left fielder. Jeff Baker was his backup throughout most of the season. In September, Craig Gentry and Jim Adduci took most of the starts in left with Gentry starting all of the final 10 games, while Murphy saw a lot of time pinch-hitting. In 142 games (114 starts), Murphy hit .220/.282/.374 with 13 HR and 45 RBI in a down year from 2012.\nMurphy made his major league pitching debut on June 4, 2013, against the Boston Red Sox when he took the mound in the eighth inning of a 17–5 rout of the Rangers in an effort to save the bullpen. Murphy notched his first major league strikeout and was the only Rangers pitcher to record a scoreless inning that evening.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn November 20, 2013, Murphy signed a 2-year, $12 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. The news was first broken by his youngest daughter, Faith. He was involved in the second known occurrence in MLB history of two balls in play simultaneously when he was confused by a ball accidentally thrown from the Cincinnati Reds' bullpen and tagged out before sliding back to third base in the seventh inning of a 9–2 Indians loss at Progressive Field on August 5, 2014.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nOn July 28, 2015, the Indians traded Murphy to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in exchange for minor league shortstop Eric Stamets. He played in 48 games for the Angels and recorded a batting average of .265, with five home runs, 16 runs scored, and 23 RBIs.\nReturn to the Red Sox.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Boston Red Sox signed Murphy to a minor league deal. He was released on March 28, 2016.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn April 14, 2016, the Minnesota Twins signed Murphy to a minor league deal, but on the 25th, Murphy announced his retirement from baseball.\nBroadcasting career.\nSince retiring from baseball, Murphy has worked as a broadcaster for Fox Sports Southwest. He has appeared as an analyst on Rangers LIVE pre and post game shows. He has also worked as a color commentator on Frisco RoughRiders broadcasts."

        "text": "The New York Titans were a professional lacrosse team based in the New York metropolitan area. The team was a member of the Eastern Division of the National Lacrosse League from 2006 to 2009. On August 11, 2009, the National Lacrosse League confirmed that the franchise would relocate to Orlando, Florida and become the Orlando Titans.\nIn their three seasons in the NLL, the Titans alternated their home games between several sporting venues. During the 2007 season, the Titans played four of their eight home games at Madison Square Garden, and the other four at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. For the 2008 season, the team played all of its home games at Madison Square Garden, while playing one game at a neutral site at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, NJ. In 2009, the Titans' home schedule consisted of two games at the Garden, five games at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey and one game at the BankAtlantic Center in Florida.\nHistory.\nIn 2006, the NLL announced the league's expansion into the New York City and Chicago markets with New York's ownership group being composed of principal owner Gary Rosenbach and including William E. Ford, Mark H. Ford, Nick Leone, Flip Huffard and Richard Ullmann. The announcement marked the return of the NLL to the New York after the demise of the New York Saints. On September 13, 2006, following an online poll, the franchise was dubbed the New York Titans. The Titans home games would be played at Madison Square Garden and Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\nInaugural season.\nOn January 6, 2007, the Titans played their first franchise game against their fellow expansion team Shamrox in Chicago, Illinois. Gewas Schindler scored the first goal in the team's history; however, the Shamrox defeated the Titans 15–12. Following a two-game losing streak, the Titans defeated the Shamrox 11–9 for their first franchise and home victory. The game also marked the first lacrosse game to be played in Madison Square Garden's history. The team completed the season in last place with a 4–12 record. Following the 2006–2007 season, Daniel resigned as team president and governor and Timothy Kelly was named the team's new chief operating officer.\n2008 season.\nAfter opening the 2008 season with a 1–4 record, the Titans rebounded and ended the season with a 10–6 record. The team finished in a four-way tie for the best record in the league with Buffalo, Minnesota, and Philadelphia. Due to the NLL's tiebreaker rules and procedures, the Titans finished third in the division and league standings, but secured their first playoff berth in franchise history. The Titans advanced to the NLL Eastern Division Final, defeating the Minnesota Swarm 11–8, however, lost 19–12 to eventual Champion's Cup-winners the Buffalo Bandits.\nFollowing the season, head coach Adam Mueller was awarded the Les Bartley Award for coach of the year. Mueller soon after announced his retirement from coaching, and former Rochester Knighthawks coach Ed Comeau was hired as the head coach for the 2009 season.\n2009 championship runners-up.\nWith new head coach Ed Comeau, the Titans finished on top of the Eastern Division standings with a 10–6 record. They would later defeat the Rochester Knighthawks and returning Champion Cup winners the Buffalo Bandits to advance to the Champion's Cup, The Titans lost 12–10 to the Calgary Roughnecks in the championship game.\nDraft history.\nNLL Entry Draft.\nFirst Round Selections"

        "title": "Official game (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, an official game (regulation game in the Major League Baseball rulebook) is a game where nine innings have been played, except when the game is scheduled with fewer innings, extra innings are required to determine a winner, or the game must be stopped before nine innings have been played, e.g. due to inclement weather. The term \"official game\" is mainly used in the context of a game that is stopped before nine innings have been played, though it has been used for other promotional purposes. \nA game that is stopped (\"called\" in the MLB rulebook) by the umpires before the regulation number of innings have been played may be considered an official game if five innings have been played ( innings if the home team is in the lead), unless the game meets one of the conditions for a suspended game. An official game that is stopped in this way is ended at the point of stoppage and statistics are added to each team's totals, while a suspended game is resumed from the point of stoppage at a later time. A game that is stopped before five innings have been played is considered \"no game\" unless it can be considered a suspended game; statistics accumulated before the stoppage are not counted and replay of the game is subject to the league rules.\nInclement weather.\nIn the case of inclement weather, any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed, with the result being final, and all records and statistics counted. A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game (to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage), or is simply canceled and replayed from the start. (This depends on the rules of each individual league.) In either case, no statistics are counted until the game becomes official.\nSince most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game. If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 4½ innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth. Games that are stopped due to power outages are treated as suspended and cannot be declared official.\nIn the Major League Baseball postseason (since 2009), all tiebreaker games that are added to the end of the regular season (since 2009), and in the regular season (since 2020), this rule does not apply; all games stopped at any time for weather or power outages are considered suspended and continued from the point of stoppage when play resumes, no matter if the game has reached the end of the fifth inning. This rule was put into place as a result of Game 5 of the 2008 World Series, which was the first postseason game in history to be suspended and resumed from the point of suspension. Prior to the 2009 postseason, a playoff game had to have at least five innings completed in order to be suspendable; a playoff game stopped prior to that point had to be started over.\nRain check.\nIn nearly all cases, the \"official game\" status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets. If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official, fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or (in most modern cases) any other available game of their choice. If a game is halted after it becomes official, the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given.\nEffects on statistical streaks.\nThe \"official game\" statistic received some attention during the 1995 season, when Cal Ripken Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played, previously held by Lou Gehrig. Large numbers were hung on the side of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore to show the number of games in Ripken's streak. Each day, a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official (since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point). A similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums (including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005, and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008 and the conversion of Turner Field to a college football stadium in Atlanta in 2016); as each game became official, the team would unveil a new (lower) number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium.\nOther sports.\nOther professional sports utilize similar rules regarding \"official\" games/events.\nMost codes of motorsport declare a race \"official\" with an official result if just three laps are completed, though only half the normal championship points are awarded if less than 75% of the race distance (rounded up to the nearest whole lap) is completed. If more than 75% of the race is completed, full points are awarded.\nThe major exception applies in the United States, mainly in NASCAR and INDYCAR, where races must go at the next full lap after halfway or past a set point of the race. A race is considered \"official\" if it has completed half the scheduled distance plus one additional lap. For instance, the Indianapolis 500 (200 laps) must complete 101 laps to be considered official.\nIn limited overs cricket, a game can only be considered complete if both teams have faced a certain number of legal deliveries (pitches); otherwise there is no result. In a 3-hour T20 cricket match, each team must face at least 30 deliveries, while in the 8-hour One Day International format, they must each receive at least 120 deliveries.\nIn boxing, a fight can be declared official for purposes of scoring in case of accidental head butts. That is typically the end of the second round, fourth round, or halfway. Fights that do not reach official status are no contest."

        "text": "Thomas Mark \"Tommy, The Bomber\" Williams (April 17, 1940 – February 8, 1992) was an American professional ice hockey player. A good skater and shooter, he received his nickname due to an incident in the early 1970s when he joked with Toronto customs officials that his bag contained a bomb (he was suspended for one game by the NHL as punishment). During most of the 1960s, Williams was the only regular American player in the NHL.\nAmateur career.\nBorn in Duluth, Minnesota, Williams was a member of the U.S. Olympic hockey team that defeated Czechoslovakia and won the gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. He scored one goal and had four assists while playing on the second line with Bill Christian and Roger Christian.\nProfessional career.\nHis National Hockey League career began when he joined the Boston Bruins for the 1961–62 NHL season. After eight seasons with the Bruins (and a serious injury in 1968 that almost ended his career) he joined the Minnesota North Stars, where he played for a season and a half until he was traded to the California Golden Seals.\nAfter just two seasons with the Golden Seals, Williams jumped to the World Hockey Association (WHA) to play for the New England Whalers. Upon his return to the NHL he joined the new expansion team Washington Capitals, led the team in scoring (22 goals, 36 assists) and was awarded the franchise's first penalty shot on December 5, 1974, against the Buffalo Sabres. He retired during the 1975–76 NHL season.\nHe and younger brother Butch Williams were the first American brothers to play in the NHL.\nPost-career.\nIn 1981, Williams was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nHe made an appearance on the American gameshow \"I've Got a Secret,\" in which his secret was (at the time, in early 1966) that he was the only American-born player in major professional hockey.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams' life was marred by personal tragedies that also had a negative impact on his playing career. In November 1970 his wife was found dead in a car; it was never determined for certain whether her death was due to accident or suicide. Normally a happy-go-lucky free spirit, he became moody and fought with North Stars manager Jack Gordon, who suspended him before trading him to the Seals. After he had retired from hockey, remarried and found a new career, his 23-year-old son Bobby Williams (a Boston Bruins prospect) died in 1987. Williams himself died of a heart attack in Hudson, Massachusetts on February 8, 1992, at the age of 51. "

        "title": "1947 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1947 Tour de France was the 34th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 25 June to 20 July. The total race distance was 21 stages over . It was the first Tour since 1939, having been cancelled during World War II, although some Tour de France-like races had been held during World War II.\nBecause the previous races had been canceled, there was no real favourite for the final victory. When René Vietto, the runner-up of 1939, captured the yellow jersey after his victory on the second stage, many thought he could remain first until the last day. Vietto, a climber, was less optimistic and lost his first place to Italian Pierre Brambilla after the time trial in stage 19. With only two stages to go, many now believed that Brambilla would win the race. On the last stage, there was an unexpected attack, and little-known French cyclist Jean Robic captured the lead. Robic had won the Tour de France without ever wearing the yellow jersey during the race, the first time that happened. (In 1953 Robic would lead the race for one more day).\nBackground.\nAfter the 1939 Tour de France, the Second World War had made it impossible to organise a big cycling event in France, although some attempts had been taken. The rights on the Tour de France, previously owned by l'Auto, had been transferred to the French government. There were two newspapers interested in taking over these rights, so they both organised cycling events. The event organised by \"l'Équipe\", \"La Course du Tour de France\", was more successful, and \"l'Équipe\" was given the right to organise the 1947 Tour de France.\nTeams.\nThe national teams format, which had been in use before the Second World War, was used again in 1947. The German team was not invited, and the Italian team was made up of Franco-Italians living in France, as the peace treaty between France and Italy was not yet official, so the countries were technically still at war.\nThe Tour organisers invited ten teams of ten cyclists each. Besides the Italian team, there was also a French team and a Belgian team, and a combined Swiss/Luxembourgian team. The plan was to have a joint Dutch-British team, but the Dutch cyclists protested because the British cyclists were too inexperienced, and the British cyclists were replaced by \"French strangers\". There were also five French regional teams: Île-de-France, West, North-East, Centre/South-West and South-East. Of the 100 cyclists, 53 finished the race.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1947 Tour de France started on 25 June, and had five rest days, in Besançon, Briançon, Nice, Luchon and Vannes. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 8.\nRace overview.\nAfter Ferdinand Kübler had won the first stage, René Vietto took the lead by winning the second stage. After the third stage only Aldo Ronconi was within 90 seconds of Vietto, and the third man in the general classification was already more than eight minutes behind.\nIn the seventh stage, when the Alps mountains were climbed, Ronconi took over the lead, but two stages later Vietto took back the lead, helped by Apo Lazaridès.\nJean Robic had lost six minutes in that ninth stage, and lost more time in the tenth stage. He was already more than 25 minutes behind, and was no longer considered a favourite, but Robic was convinced that he would win the Tour.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Albert Bourlon escaped directly after the start. He stayed away until the end of the stage, later. This is the longest escape in the Tour de France after the second World War.\nIn the fifteenth stage, Robic escaped in the Pyrénees, and beat the other by more than ten minutes. Because of the time bonuses for reaching the mountain tops first, he even won back more than fifteen minutes. In the general classification, Robic rose to fifth place.\nWith only three stages to go in the Tour, Vietto was still in the lead, 94 seconds ahead of Pierre Brambilla. The nineteenth stage was an individual time trial, the longest in Tour history. In that stage, Vietto lost considerable time, and Brambilla took over the lead in the general classification. Vietto performed worse than expected; there was speculation about why he performed so badly, and some said it was because of the motorcycle accident of a friend, while others said it was because he drank a bottle of cider during the time trial.\nThe last stage was flat, which makes it hard for escapers to win time. In that last stage, there was a hilltop prime, where money could be won by the first cyclist that passed. Although a group had already passed that hill, Robic was not aware of this, and sprinted for this prime. When he reached the top, Brambilla had been dropped. Robic and Fachleitner, fifth in the general classification, started to work together, and left Brambilla and Ronconi minutes behind. Around 140 km before the finish, they were three minutes ahead of Brambilla, which made Robic the virtual leader of the race. At that point Robic told Fachleitner: \"You can not win the Tour, because I will not let you escape. If you ride with me, I will pay you 100.000 Francs.\"\nWhen they reached Paris, they had won 13 minutes on them, enough to make Robic the winner of the Tour de France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe cyclist to reach the finish in the least time was the winner of the stage. The time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added together. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. With his victory, Robic won 500.000 francs. Additionally, future exhibitions and endorsements due to the Tour victory would give him another 3 to 4 million francs.\nAdditionally, there was the mountains classification, which did not have a jersey associated with it in 1947. Sixteen mountains were selected by the Tour organisation, divided in two classes. In the first-class mountains, the ten first cyclists received points, with 10 points for the first, 9 for the second, and so forth, to 1 point for the tenth. In the second-class mountains, only the first five cyclists received points, 5 for the first one to 1 for the fifth one. The mountains classification was won by Pierre Brambilla.\nThe team classification was calculated in 1947 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner.\nThe Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera on stage 11. This prize was won by Raymond Impanis.\nAftermath.\nRobic never wore the yellow jersey as leader in the general classification in 1947, because he only became leader in the final stage. Only Jan Janssen has repeated that, in the 1968 Tour de France.\nLater in his career, Robic wore the yellow jersey for one day in the 1953 Tour de France."

        "text": "Daniel Ellis (born June 19, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently a goaltending scout for the Chicago Blackhawks.\nHe played in the National Hockey League for the Dallas Stars, Nashville Predators, Tampa Bay Lightning, Anaheim Ducks, Carolina Hurricanes, and the Florida Panthers. He served as an assistant coach with the Omaha Lancers of the United States Hockey League in 2016–17 before assuming his current role.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nEllis was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan but grew up in Orangeville, Ontario and played his minor hockey for the AA Orangeville Flyers of the OMHA Tri-County Hockey League and then eventually AAA hockey for the Halton Hills Hurricanes of the OMHA South-Central Triple A Hockey League.\nEllis was drafted by the Owen Sound Platers of the Ontario Hockey League and played Major Midget hockey for Halton in 1996–97, and the following season for the Newmarket Hurricanes club of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League (OPJHL). Ellis maintained his amateur status in order to remain eligible for a US hockey scholarship.\nAfter one season in Newmarket, Ellis moved south to the Omaha Lancers, in the USHL where he was awarded Goaltender of the Year, Player of the Year and named a First Team All-Star.\nFollowing his USHL season, Ellis then spent three years at the University of Nebraska at Omaha before signing after the 2002–03 season.\nDallas Stars.\nThe Dallas Stars drafted Ellis in the 2nd round, 60th overall, of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. For the 2003–2004 season, Ellis split time between the Utah Grizzlies and Idaho Steelheads of the ECHL, finishing the season with the Steelheads. In Idaho, Ellis had great success, leading the team to a Kelly Cup Championship win and nabbing the 2004 Playoff MVP award with a record of 13–0 and a 1.86 goals-against average.\nFor the 2005–06 AHL season, Ellis spent his time exclusively with the Iowa Stars. He split playing time with fellow goalie Mike Smith, but ultimately lost the job as the season came to a close. He finished the season with a record of 16 wins, 13 losses and 1 tie.\nEllis made his NHL debut on February 8, 2004 against the Los Angeles Kings. Ellis made 25 saves en route to his first career win as Dallas defeated Los Angeles 4 – 3.\nNashville Predators.\nIn 2007, Ellis signed as a free agent with the Nashville Predators. Due to sub-standard play from starting goalie Chris Mason, Ellis took over the starting goaltender duties for the Predators for the 2007–08 NHL season. On October 25, 2007, in only his second career start, his first with the Predators—who signed him as a free agent on July 5, 2007—he won 3–0 against the Atlanta Thrashers, making 20 saves en route to his first NHL shutout. On November 1, 2007, he posted another shutout against the Vancouver Canucks for his fourth win of the season. He played very well down the stretch, posting two shutouts in the final few games and leading the Predators to the playoffs. As a result, he was named as the NHL's Second Star of the Week for the week ending March 30, 2008.\nEllis posted impressive statistics during the 2007–2008 season, being among the top goaltenders in save percentage (1st), shutouts (T-3rd), and GAA (12th). He also received national coverage for his excessive weight loss during games, receiving intravenous fluids after games, and for his shutout streak of 233:39 over the course of four games.\nHe earned the nickname \"Snowstorm\" in the spring of 2008 when the poor play of Ellis and teammate Chris Mason caused the team to call up minor-league goalie Pekka Rinne. However, Rinne was delayed from joining the team due to a snowstorm, and Ellis was given the start in the subsequent game against the Chicago Blackhawks on March 22, 2008. He held the Blackhawks to one goal on 38 shots and led the Predators to a 2–1 shootout victory. This victory earned him the starting job for the team, lasting into the 2008 playoffs.\nHe was the starting goalie for Nashville in their 2008 first-round series against the number one-seeded Detroit Red Wings. Ellis stopped 71 of 78 shots he faced in the first two games, both losses. Back home at Nashville for games three and four, he proceeded to stop 62 of 67 shots as the Predators won both games at home to tie the series at 2. Game 5 was Ellis' best game of the series as he made 52 saves in a 2–1 overtime loss. The Red Wings closed out the series in Game 6 at Nashville with a 3–0 win. Ellis was victimized by Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström's skipping shot from behind center ice for the game's first goal, which turned out to be the winner.\nOn June 19, 2008, Ellis was re-signed to a two-year, $3.5 million contract by the Predators. During the 2008–09 season, Ellis wasn't as sharp as the previous season, recording only 11 wins compared to his 23 wins of the previous season. Because of this, Rinne, who was Nashville's backup goaltender at the start of the season, took over the starting job. Ellis recorded 15 wins in 31 appearances during the 2009–10 NHL season with a 2.69 goals-against-average.\nOn June 29, 2010, Ellis' negotiation rights were traded to the Montreal Canadiens with Dustin Boyd, for Sergei Kostitsyn and future considerations. Without a deal in place before July 1, 2010, Ellis became an unrestricted free agent.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nEllis signed a two-year, $3 million deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning as a free agent on July 1, 2010.\nLater years.\nOn February 24, 2011 Ellis was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in a goalie swap for Curtis McElhinney. After posting a solid 8–3 record upon his arrival in Anaheim, he made a postseason start in round one of the 2011 Playoffs, but lost the starting job to Ray Emery after allowing four goals on 24 shots.\nAfter the conclusion of the 2012–13 NHL lockout and playing on an AHL contract with the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, Ellis signed with NHL affiliate, the Carolina Hurricanes on January 8, 2013 as a backup to starter Cam Ward. Ellis got into his first game with the Hurricanes during the first game of the season, January 19 against the Florida Panthers after Ward let in four goals in the first period.\nOn July 5, 2013 after a one-year stint in Carolina, Ellis re-joined his original draft team the Dallas Stars, on a two-year deal to be the back-up goalie to Kari Lehtonen, with an Average Annual Value of $900,000.\nOn March 5, 2014, Ellis was traded to the Florida Panthers in return for goalie Tim Thomas. He appeared in six games for the Panthers that season. In September 2014, the Panthers assigned him to their AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage.\nOn July 4, 2015, having left the Panthers as a free agent, Ellis signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Washington Capitals and spent most of the season playing with the Hershey Bears, their AHL affiliate.\nTwitter controversy.\nOn September 8, 2010, Ellis lashed out to the public via his Twitter account, expressing frustration and anger towards the 24 percent pay cut NHL players took when the 2004-05 NHL Lockout was settled with the new collective bargaining agreement by stating, \"I am more stressed about money now than I was in college.\" He then stated that \"players deserve the money they get because they are specialists.\"\nDespite signing a two-year, $3 million contract with the Lightning, Ellis added, \"If you lost 18% of your income would you be happy? If you don’t make a lot of money, I don’t expect you to understand.\" When a negative reception ensued, he told followers, \"I am not holding a gun at your head to follow so do yourself a favor.\" He then retracted his statement released by the Lightning, stating \"I am deeply sorry if I offended anyone via my recent statements on Twitter. I should have known better.\" Mike Russo of the Minneapolis Star Tribune commented, \"No matter the point, pro athletes are better off not talking money during such turbulent times.\"\nPersonal life.\nEllis was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, but was raised in Orangeville, Ontario. He moved to Nebraska when his college career began and resides during the offseason in Omaha. Ellis is a devout Christian and displays a cross at the back of his mask. He is married and has two children."

        "text": "The Northern League was a name used by several minor league baseball organizations that operated off and on between 1902 and 1971 in the upper midwestern United States and Manitoba, Canada. The name was later used by the independent Northern League from 1993 to 2010.\nIncarnations.\nThe Northern League name represented four leagues in this time frame:\nHistorical overview.\nThe first Northern League operated between 1902 and 1905. Charter members were the Winnipeg Maroons, Crookston Crooks, Fargo, Devil's Lake, Grand Forks and Cavalier.\nIn 1906, the league merged with the Copper Country Soo League to become the Northern-Copper Country League (1906–1907). A second Northern League was attempted in 1908, but did not finish its first season. The third Northern League appeared when the Central International League of 1912 expanded and changed its name in 1913. This third Northern League would last until 1917, when it was forced to disband due to a lack of players as a result of World War I.\nThe league did not re-emerge until 1933, when it began play with the Brainerd Muskies, Brandon Grays, Crookston Pirates, East Grand Forks Colts, Eau Claire Cardinals, Fargo-Moorhead Twins, Superior Blues and Winnipeg Maroons. The league did not operate between 1943 and 1945 because of a lack of manpower during World War II, and finally folded again in 1971.\nWhile the Northern League in its various incarnations began as an independent loop in 1902, it was Class D (1903–1905, 1908, 1917, 1933–1940) and Class C (1913–1916, 1941–1942, 1946–1962) under the antiquated classification system for Minor League Baseball.

He has also been an assistant coach of the Queensland rugby league team under former Melbourne teammate Billy Slater since 2022.\nAn n international and Queensland State of Origin representative, Smith is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. During his nineteen-year career, Smith won the Dally M Medal as the NRL's player of the year in 2006 and 2017, the Golden Boot Award as the international player of the year in 2007 and 2017, and the NRL's Dally M Hooker of the Year on nine occasions.

He is also the highest all-time points scorer in NRL history, having surpassed Hazem El Masri's 2,418 points on 12 April 2019. Smith also holds the NRL records for most goals kicked (1295), most tackles made (16917), most grand final points scored (44) and most wins (310).\nSmith was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours for his service to rugby league. He retired from professional rugby league in 2021.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born on 18 June 1983 in Logan, Queensland, Australia. He attended Marsden State High School.\nPlaying career.\nEarly Career (2000–2001).\nSmith played at for the Logan Brothers in Logan City. After scoring 188 points for the Norths Devils in the Queensland Cup he moved up to the NRL with the Melbourne Storm club.\nJoining the Storm (2002–2003).\nSmith's first two games for Melbourne were during the 2002 NRL season, both played at half-back (No.7). Returning to the Queensland Cup, he won the Norths Devils player of the year award in 2002. The following year he played as the Storm's hooker. In 2003, the Queensland rugby league team were without a specialist hooker. After experimenting with different players in the position for the first two matches of the 2003 State of Origin series and losing both, Smith was named at hooker (No.9) for the third match. For the next six years, no other player wore the number 9 for the Maroons until this run of 19 consecutive Origins was cut due to injury. He was named the Melbourne Storm's rookie of the year in 2003.\nEarly success and Representative selection (2005–2007).\nIn 2005, Smith was named the Melbourne Storm's player of the year. The following year he first represented Australia and won the Dally M Medal. Also in Round 3 of 2006 Smith captained the club for the first time and in what became a very successful year for him as later that year he led the Storm to the 2006 NRL Grand Final. During the Grand Final, while the game was still in the balance, he was forced from the field with injury, which the Storm's loss has been largely attributed to.\nAt the Melbourne Storm awards night Smith was named the Storm's 2006 player of the year.\nSmith was selected to play for the Australian national team at hooker the 2007 ANZAC Test match victory against New Zealand. For the 2007 State of Origin series, Smith took out both the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series and Ron Mcauliffe Medal for Queensland player of the series.

Smith captained the Maroons for the entire 2008 State of Origin series due to the absence of regular captain Darren Lockyer. The Maroons won the series, despite losing the first match 18–10. In August 2008, Smith was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad. Cameron was suspended for two weeks in the 2008 finals series after a grapple tackle on Brisbane's Sam Thaiday. The suspension would have only been one week had he not have carried over points from a previous grapple tackle in round 1 of the year's competition. This meant he was suspended for Melbourne's 2008 grand final. Melbourne Storm CEO Brian Waldron and coach Craig Bellamy claimed the judiciary had made their minds up before Cameron's case was heard. The judiciary panel members then threatened to sue the club if the comments were not retracted. Cameron signed a four-year extension to his contract in December 2008, resulting in him being a contracted player through to the end of at least the 2012 season. His contract is rumoured to be partly funded by third party sponsors who do not contribute to the standard salary cap. He became the Melbourne Storm's most experienced playing player due to the retirement of Matt Geyer at the end of 2008. He became the last current Storm player in the squad who played under Mark Murray as well as the only one to have played in a season when the Storm did not make the finals due to their performance (the Storm finished 10th in 2002, the year Smith made his debut).\nIn April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25 man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009. He was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009.

He scored the try that saved Australia from losing in the opening match and also scored in the Kangaroos' victory against England in the final.\nMany of Smith's club achievements between the years of 2006 and 2010 were later placed under an asterisk after the Melbourne Storm were stripped of all honours achieved in those years due to the discovery of salary cap breaches within the club.\nNational captaincy and Premiership success (2010–2012).\nIn 2010 he played in the 2010 World Club Challenge at halfback in the absence of his usual number 7 Cooper Cronk due to injury. Smith kicked 5 goals and was named man of the match. For the 2010 ANZAC Test victory, Smith was selected to play at hooker. For the first time since Game II of the 2003 Origin series, Smith wasn't wearing the number 9 for Queensland, after he failed to overcome the elbow injury he sustained playing in that test. He was replaced by Matt Ballin. In Round 26 of the 2010 NRL season Smith became the first Melbourne Storm player to reach 1,000 points after successfully converting Ryan Hinchcliffe's try. \nSmith played in the 42–0 thrashing of the Papua New Guinea national rugby league team during the 2010 Four Nations. It was a game where he converted 5 tries and scored once. He was later named man of the match.\nSmith was named man-of-the-match in Queensland's win in Game I and later Game III of the 2011 State of Origin series, subsequently resulting in his naming as the Wally Lewis medal winning man-of-the-series. On 3 November 2011 The annual RLIF Awards dinner was held at the Tower of London and Smith was named hooker of the year.\nFollowing Darren Lockyer's retirement at the end of the 2011 season, Smith became captain of both Australia and Queensland. He captained both sides to the 2012 ANZAC Test and 2012 State of Origin series victories respectively. At the 2012 Dally M Awards Smith was named the NRL's hooker of the year. He captained Storm to victory in the 2012 NRL Grand Final over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Smith also received the Rugby League International Federation's international player of the year award for 2012.\nWorld Cup success (2013–2016).\nIn early 2013, Smith captained the Storm to victory in the 2013 World Club Challenge over Leeds earning the title of world champions.\nSmith captained Australia in the 2013 ANZAC Test and played at hooker. He kicked four goals from six attempts in what was the first test match ever played in Canberra.\nAfter victory in the third and deciding game of the 2013 State of Origin series Smith was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series, in which he captained the Queensland team which extended their record winning streak to 8 years.\nOn 9 June 2013, Smith played his 250th game for the Melbourne Storm, the second only player to have achieved that feat.\nQueensland's win in Game III of the 2014 State of Origin series made Smith the first player in State of Origin history to win 20 games.\nOn 30 November 2013, Smith captained Australia to a dominant 34 to 2 win against New Zealand in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup final ensuring the Australian side went through the entire tournament undefeated.\nIn November 2014, in the Four Nations game against England, Smith became just the sixth player to appear for Australia in 40 test matches.\nOn 9 July 2015, Smith captained Queensland to a 2 to 1 series win against New South Wales winning game three emphatically by 52 – 6. It was Smiths' 9th series win in ten years and his fourth series win as captain. At series end, Smith had equalled Darren Lockyer for most Queensland appearances with 36 and received his fifth man of the match award in game one to sit in equal second behind Wally Lewis for most man of the match awards in State of Origin.\nOn 17 July 2015, Smith became the Melbourne Storms' first 300-game player and only the 24th player in the history of the NRL to achieve such a feat. As of April 2017, Smith is one of only three current NRL players to have eclipsed 300 NRL games.\nOn 22 June 2016, Smith captained Queensland to their 10th series win in 11 years over New South Wales. Smith was awarded his sixth man of the match award in game 2 of Origin and was awarded the Wally Lewis medal as the player of the series for the fourth time at series end.\nSetting records, World Cup and Premiership success (2017–2019).\nOn 10 March 2017, Smith reached 2000 career points in a match against the New Zealand Warriors, becoming the first forward, the first Queenslander, and just the fifth player in history to have achieved the milestone.\nOn 30 July 2017, Smith became only the 3rd player in NRL history to play 350 games, behind Darren Lockyer (355) and equal with Terry Lamb. On 9 September, he played his 356th match and thereby became NRL's most capped player of all time.\nOn 2 December 2017, he captained the Kangaroos to another World Cup victory, defeating England in the final 6–0. He was also named in the team of the tournament.\nOn 30 March 2018, during the round 4 fixture against the Sharks, Smith was sent to the sin bin for backchatting. This was Smith's first sinbinning in his career and the Storm lost the game 14–4 in a match that had 33 penalties in total.\nOn 15 May 2018, Smith announced his retirement from all representative football, making him unavailable for Queensland or Australian selection.\nIn July 2019, he became the first NRL player to play 400 games.

For perspective, only one NRL or AFL player has since replicated the feat: Shaun Burgoyne of Port Adelaide and Hawthorn in 2021.\nMore Premiership success in COVID-affected year and retirement (2020–2021).\nThe Melbourne Storm 2020 NRL season saw Smith captain the team for his 13th consecutive year.

As the final stage of the most recognised bike race in the world, winning it is considered very prestigious.\nThe stage typically starts on the outskirts of Paris, and teams agree on a truce for the opening portion of the race, with cyclists taking the opportunity to have a moment of tranquility, laughing, and celebrating the achievement of finishing the Tour de France. The rider leading the general classification - whose lead is by custom not contested on the final stage, though usually it is by that point unassailable - poses for photographs, often taking a glass of champagne on the way.\nThe second part of the race is more hotly contested. This consists of between six and ten laps of a circuit of the Champs-Élysées, a wide partly-cobblestoned road. Riders try to break away from the peloton to secure victory, though as of 2020 such attempts have only resulted in a victory on six occasions (and on only three since 1979). On the other occasions (except 1989, when the final stage was a time-trial), the winner has come from a mass sprint and has therefore typically been a specialist sprinter. At times this means that the final stage has settled the points classification, which is usually won by a sprinter.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the course was also used for La Course by Le Tour de France, a women's one-day race. The first edition of Tour de France Femmes in 2022 also used the course, as the first stage of the race.\nHistory.\nIn the first Tour of 1903, the finish was at Ville-d'Avray. From 1904 to 1967 it was at the Parc des Princes track and from 1968 to 1974, during the heyday of Eddy Merckx, at the Vélodrome de Vincennes.\nIn 1974, Félix Lévitan, co-director of the Tour, and reporter Yves Mourousi suggested a finish on the Champs-Élysées. Mourousi directly contacted French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing to obtain permission. The first stage took place in 1975: this was a Paris-Paris stage of 25 laps (). The Belgian Walter Godefroot won the sprint and Bernard Thévenet received the yellow jersey from the hands of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. In 1977, French Alain Meslet became the first rider to win alone.\nSince 1978, the final stage has generally started from outside the city, with only the final part of the stage following the core route. The number of laps has varied between six and ten. Major innovations have generally been avoided, with the notable exception of the 1989 stage which operated as a time-trial.\nIn 2013, in celebration of the 100th Tour de France the stage was shifted to a late afternoon start, finishing in the evening. The course also entered the Champs Elysées via the courtyards of the Louvre Palace, passing directly by the Louvre Pyramid, and utilising the traffic circle around the Arc de Triomphe rather than making a u-turn short of it; these changes have been retained in subsequent years. In 2015, bad weather caused the Tour organisers to declare the overall classification neutralised upon entry to the Champs-Élysées, before the stage finished.\nThe course was also used for the first three editions of La Course by Le Tour de France, a women's one-day race held between 2014 and 2021. In these years the race was held in a kermesse-style circuit racing format. The first edition of Tour de France Femmes in 2022 used the course as the first stage of an 8-day race.\nDue to Paris hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics, the 2024 Tour de France will not finish in Paris but instead in Nice.\nArrivals.\nDue to the high profile of the last day as well as its setting, the stage is prestigious. The overall Tour placings are typically settled before the final stage, so the racing is often for the glory of finishing the Tour and, at times, to settle the points classification. The leader of the Tour de France is, by convention, not challenged for their lead on this final day. Traditionally, the stage starts with champagne served by the race leader's team, on-the-road photo opportunities and joking around.\nAs the riders approach Paris, the racing heats up as the sprinters and their teams begin the real racing of the day. When the riders reach central Paris, they enter the Champs-Élysées riding up the Rue de Rivoli, on to the Place de la Concorde and then swing right on to the Champs-Élysées itself. The riders ride now a total of eight laps (including around the Arc de Triomphe, down the Champs-Élysées, round les Tuileries and the Louvre and across the Place de la Concorde back to the Champs-Élysées). In past Tours, the riders would complete ten laps before the Tour was over.\nWhen a rider has reached a significant milestone over the course of the concluding Tour, it is customary for the peloton to let him enter the Champs-Elysées section of the stage in first place. Such an honor was bestowed upon American George Hincapie in 2012, in recognition of his final and record setting 17th Tour de France.\nWhile a number of riders will try to pull away from the peloton on the Champs-Elysées, chances of success are slim and these attempts are often seen as one last opportunity for teams to showcase their colors. It is extremely hard for a small group to resist the push of chasing sprinter's teams on the stage's flat circuit, even more so than in a linear race, and the overwhelming majority have ended in a mass sprint.\nIn early years, breakaway wins did not appear uncommon. A surprising three straight occurred between 1977 and 1979. However, with the advent of modern racing tactics, the feat has become very rare, lending an increasingly valued place in Tour lore to the few who have achieved it. Those are Frenchmen Alain Meslet (1977), Bernard Hinault (1979) and Eddy Seigneur (1994), Dutchman Gerrie Knetemann (1978), American Jeff Pierce (1987), and Kazakhstani Alexander Vinokourov (2005).\nGeneral classification.\nAlthough generally uncontested, there have been two occasions on which the last stage saw attacks on the leading position in the general classification. In 1979, Joop Zoetemelk was 3:07 behind Bernard Hinault before the final stage. Zoetemelk attacked on the last stage, hoping to win enough time to claim the victory. Hinault chased Zoetemelk, and beat him for the stage victory.\nBernard Hinault in 1979 and in 1982 was the only rider winning on Champs-Élysées in yellow jersey (LeMond in 1989 won it \"after\" the stage but didn't wear it \"during\" the stage).\nIn 1989, Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by 58 seconds over a 24 km time trial from Versailles. In doing so, he closed a 50-second gap to win the 1989 Tour de France by eight seconds. It was the first (and only) time trial final stage on the Champs-Élysées. The 1964, 1965 and 1967 Tours finished with time trials to the Parc des Princes, and the 1968 to 1971 stages had time trials to the Vélodrome de Vincennes (Cipale).\nIn 2005, Lance Armstrong had a comfortable lead in the general classification, but behind him Alexander Vinokourov and Levi Leipheimer were only two seconds apart, on fifth and sixth place. Vinokourov succeeded in a breakaway during the last kilometre and, because of his stage win and bonus seconds, overtook Leipheimer for fifth position overall. As of 2023, this is the last time the stage was not decided in a bunch sprint.\nPoints classification.\nWhile points classification is mainly associated to a top sprinter competition, the jersey wearer is generally unlucky on Champs-Élysées. The three riders with most green jerseys, Peter Sagan, Erik Zabel and Sean Kelly, never won on Champs-Élysées. Only five times the green jersey wearer won: Freddy Maertens in 1976 first semi-stage and in 1981, Djamolidine Abdoujaparov in 1993, Robbie McEwen in 2002, Mark Cavendish in 2011 and Sam Bennett in 2020. In 1979, Bernard Hinault led the points classification when he won on Champs-Élysées but he did it wearing the yellow jersey. In some years, the points classification was decided on that last stage.\nIn 1984, Frank Hoste had been leading the points classification for most of the race, but Sean Kelly had taken over the lead on the penultimate stage, with a difference of 4 points. Hoste ended third in the last stage against Kelly fifth, which made Hoste the winner by 4 points.\nIn the final stages of the 1987 Tour de France, the lead in the points classification switched between Jean-Paul van Poppel and Stephen Roche. Before the final stage, Roche was leading by 17 points, but during the last stage Van Poppel won back 16 points by intermediate sprints. Van Poppel's ninth place in the stage was then enough to win the points classification by 16 points.\nIn 1991, Djamolidine Abdoujaparov clipped his wheels on barriers. With less than 100m left he tumbled head-over-heels in a spectacular crash. After he regained consciousness, he was helped across the line to clinch the sprinters' competition.\nIn 2001, Stuart O'Grady had been leading the points classification for most of the race, but Erik Zabel overtook him at the final moment.\nIn 2003, the green jersey was settled by a close finish between Baden Cooke and Robbie McEwen finishing 2nd and 3rd respectively, that resulted in Cooke finished with 216 points to McEwen's 214."

Every year as part of the tournament there is a family picnic golf event held. Parents and family members meet and eat together while enjoying a casual game of golf.\nHistory.\nThe event was founded by Nan Ryan in 1973 after a statement she'd heard while on a Quincy golf course, the statement was \"It's a shame the midwest doesn't have a junior tournament like the International in Florida\". However 33 years later the tournament in Quincy became ranked as the third most widely attended junior golf event in the world. Pepsi became the primary sponsor of the golf tournament soon after. \nThe First Little People's and after.\nThe first Little People's event drew 174 girls and boys and was hosted by the Cedar Crest Country Club in Quincy, which the event in later years had to be split between all the golf course in town because of the larger crowds. The Westview Golf Course was added to the event in 1975, Spring Lake Country Club was later added in 1993, and finally the Knights of Columbus Golf Course in 1994 was added to accommodate the players ages 3 through 7. \nAfter the success of Tiger Woods, attendance of the Little People's event jumped to 672 kids in 1997, although Woods had never played in the Little People's his impact on the sport was felt, after which another course was added, the Norwoods Golf Club in nearby Hannibal, Missouri. In 2007, when the new 18 - 19 division was created, the Deer Run Golf Course in Hamilton, Illinois was added to the line-up after attendance reached 922.\nNow the internationally known tournament for boys and girls aged three through 17 is played at five golf courses in the Quincy, Illinois, area, with the collegiate division, for men and women 18 through 21, playing at the Harry Mussatto (Western Illinois University) Golf Course in Macomb, Illinois. There are currently seven age divisions for boys and seven age divisions for girls in Pepsi's Little People Golf Championship (3-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13, 14-15, 16-18)."

        "text": "The 1912 Tour de France was the tenth running of the Tour de France. It consisted of 15 stages for a total of . The Tour took place from 30 June to 28 July. The riders rode at an average speed of . After 4 stage wins during the Tour of Belgium, the Alcyon team hired Odile Defraye to help Gustave Garrigou repeat his win of the 1911 Tour de France. However, as the race progressed, it was clear that Defraye was the stronger rider, and he was made team leader. Defraye won the 1912 Tour de France, while Garrigou came in third place.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe point system from the 1911 Tour de France was still in use, including the cleaning up of the classification after stages 8 and 14.\nIt was changed in one aspect: if one or more cyclists, excluding the first seven, finished in the same time, they split their points. In stage 8, the first thirteen cyclists finished at the same time. The first seven to cross the line got the normal number of points, but the eighth to thirteenth cyclists all got 10.5 points.\nTechnically, the bicycles were similar to the 1911 bicycles, only Stéphanois Panel experimented with a derailleur system. This was quickly forbidden afterwards by Tour organiser Henri Desgrange, and only allowed again in 1937.\nTeams.\nThe 1912 Tour started with 131 cyclists; there were 10 teams of 5 cyclists each; these 50 cyclists included all favourites for the overall victory. The remaining 81 cyclists started in the isolés category. The Alcyon team had the pre-race favourite, Gustave Garrigou, the winner of the previous Tour de France. To help him, they hired Odile Defraye, who had performed well at the 1912 Tour of Belgium. At first, the Alcyon team did not want to select Defraye, but the Belgian representative of Alcyon posed commercial threats, and Defraye was selected.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, the favourites remained calm. This first stage was won by Charles Crupelandt. Defraye finished 14th, while Garrigou finished in 21st place. In the second stage, Defraye and Garrigou were ahead of the rest, and Defraye won the stage. At that point, Defraye was second in the general classification, only one point behind Vincenzo Borgarello, the first Italian leader of the general classification ever. When Garrigou punctured because of nails spread by vandals, Defraye waited for him. During the long chase for the rest, it was clear that Defraye was stronger than Garrigou, who encouraged Defraye to continue alone. Defraye became a favourite for the overall victory, and his teammates gave him their support. He was the first Belgian who had a serious chance to win the Tour de France, so all Belgians in the race, regardless of their team, were helping him.\nOne remaining competitor was Octave Lapize. In the fifth stage, Defraye had problems with his knees, and was more than fifteen minutes behind Lapize. Defraye came back, and kept Lapize one point behind him in the general classification. In the sixth stage, Defraye attacked and only Lapize could follow, as they climbed the major Alp mountains together. Then Defraye punctured, and Lapize won the stage, so Lapize shared the lead with Defraye. In the seventh stage, Defraye punctured again, but he came back and won the stage. The eighth stage was a flat stage, and the fight was expected to continue in the ninth stage. Before the ninth stage, Lapize was only 2 points behind. During that stage in the Pyrenees, Defraye broke away on the Col de Portet d'Aspet, and Lapize could not follow. Later, Lapize stopped in protest because all the Belgians were riding for Defraye. Lapize said: \"How can you expect me to challenge in such conditions?\" The rest of his team La Française, the two remaining Charles Crupelandt and Marcel Godivier did not start the next stage, also in protest.\nEugene Christophe, who dominated in the Alps with three consecutive stage victories, including the longest solo breakaway ever of and had shared the lead after his third stage victory, became the second-placed cyclist after Lapize's retreat. Christophe was not a good sprinter, so he had to break away from Defraye to win back points. With all the Belgians helping Defraye, he could not do this anymore. He could pose no real threat, and Defraye won the overall victory unchallenged. If the Tour de France was decided on time instead of points, Christophe would have led the race until the final stage, where he accepted his loss and allowed a group including Defraye to ride away.\nResults.\nGeneral classification.\nOf the 131 starting cyclists, 41 finished. The winner received 5000 francs for his victory.\nOther classifications.\nJules Deloffre, ranked 21 in the general classification, became the winner of the \"isolés\" category. The \"isolés\" classification was calculated in the same way as the general classification, but only with the stage results for the cyclists riding as isolated riders. Therefore, it was possible that Deloffre beat Pratesi with 41 points to 42 points in the isolés category, whereas Pratesi ranked higher in the general classification. The organising newspaper l'Auto named Odile Defraye the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification."

        "title": "1950 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1950 Tour de France was the 37th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 13 July to 7 August. It consisted of 22 stages over .\nGino Bartali, captain of the Italian team, threatened and assaulted by some French supporters accusing him to have caused Jean Robic's fall on the Col d'Aspin, retired after winning the 12th stage from Pau to Saint-Gaudens and left the race together with all the other Italian riders (including Fiorenzo Magni, who was wearing the yellow jersey). The lead transferred to Swiss cyclist Ferdinand Kübler, who was able to keep the lead until the end of the race. Kübler became the first Swiss winner of the Tour de France.\nThe mountains classification was won by Louison Bobet, while the Belgian team won the team classification.\nAlgerian-French cyclist Abdel-Kader Zaaf became famous in this Tour de France by being so disoriented that he rode in the wrong direction.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe \"interest\" for the yellow jersey (the prize money for the leader of the general classification after each stage) was increased to 100.000 French Francs.\nIn 1949, the French TV had reported every evening about the Tour de France, and in 1950, live coverage of every stage was given.\nThe time cut-offs, the maximum time a cyclist was allowed to finish a stage, was reduced.\nIn the previous years, the Tour de France had been decided in the mountains. The organisation wanted the other aspects of the race to be more important, so some mountains were not visited in 1950, and the time bonification for cyclists that reached mountain tops first was reduced. from 1 minute in 1949 to 40 seconds in 1950.\nThe riders had sometimes been helped by team assistants who directly assisted the riders by pushing them from within the team cars, under the pretence of supplying them with a drink. In 1950, the Tour organisation paid extra care for this, and penalised the cyclists if it happened.\nThe prize for winning a stage was increased from 30.000 French Francs to 50.000 French Francs.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1950 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. The three major cycling countries in 1950, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 10 cyclists. Other countries sent teams of 6 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Italy and Belgium also sent two extra teams of young riders of 6 cyclists each.\nThe French regional cyclists were divided into five teams of 10 cyclists: Paris, Île-de-France/North-East, West, Centre/South-West and South-East. Originally, the plan was to have one extra international team of six cyclists with Spanish cyclists, but this extra team became a North African team, with Moroccan and Algerian cyclists; at the time, portions of Morocco were a French protectorate, and Algeria was an integral part of France. This was the first African team to compete in the Tour de France. Altogether this made 116 cyclists.\nThere were 60 French cyclists (of which 2 French-Moroccan and 4 French-Algerian), 22 Italian, 16 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 6 Luxembourg and 6 Swiss cyclists. On the first day of the race, before the Tour had started, French cyclist Charles Coste was replaced by Paul Giguet.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the previous Tour de France, Fausto Coppi, was injured during the 1950 Giro d'Italia, so he could not defend his title. Still the Italians were favourites, especially Gino Bartali, who had come second in the 1950 Giro d'Italia behind Hugo Koblet, who did not enter the 1950 Tour de France. Other candidates for the victory were Bobet, Kübler, Ockers and Geminiani. Two days before the Tour started, the organisation held a poll amongst 25 journalists, who each gave their eight favourites for the victory. Bartali was on the most lists, 23. Robic was written on 20 lists, Lauredi on 19, Bobet and Goldschmidt on 17.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1950 Tour de France started on 13 July, and had four rest days, in Dinard, Pau, Nice and Saint-Étienne. The route had been revealed in January 1950. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 18.\nRace overview.\nThe start of the 1950 Tour de France was given on 13 July by Orson Welles. Things started well for the Italian team, as they won five of the first ten stages, although the yellow jersey for the leader of the general classification was exchanged between Luxembourgian Jean Goldschmit and French Bernard Gauthier.\nThe sixth stage was won by Swiss cyclist Ferdinand Kübler. During the race, Kübler had changed jerseys, which gave him 25 seconds penalty time.\nIn the eleventh stage, the first mountain stage of the race, Gino Bartali was away together with French Jean Robic. There was a lot of crowd, and they pressed forward to see the cyclist coming. This caused Bartali to fall down during the descent of the Col d'Aspin, and this caused Robic to also fall down. Bartali got up and won the stage, but felt threatened by spectators, who punched and kicked him. One spectator had threatened Bartali with a knife. Bartali told his team manager Alfredo Binda that he was leaving the Tour de France, and that all Italian cyclists should abandon the race. Not all Italian cyclists wanted to leave: the members from the second Italian team (the Italian Cadets) and Adolfo Leoni wanted to stay. Some Italian cyclists said they wanted to stay in the race to help Magni defend the leading position. Magni felt bad about giving up the chance to win the Tour de France, but accepted the decision. The Tour organisation wanted to keep the Italian cyclists in the race, and among other compromises offered to give them neutral gray jerseys, so the spectators would not recognize them. None of this helped, and both Italian teams left the race. As a consequence, the fifteenth stage, that was originally scheduled to end in Italy (Sanremo), was rescheduled to end in Menton.\nWith Magni out of the race, Swiss Ferdinand Kübler became the new leader of the general classification, closely followed by Bobet and Geminiani. Out of respect for Magni, Kübler did not wear the yellow jersey (indicating the leader in the general classification) in the 12th stage.\nIn the twelfth stage, all the favourites finished together. That stage was won by Belgian Maurice Blomme, but not without difficulties: he was so exhausted that he mistook a dark shadow for the finish line, and stopped racing. The secretary of the Tour de France, Jean Garnault, had to put him back on his bicycle so he would ride the last meters of the stage.\nIn that stage thirteen, the temperature was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, Marcel Molinès and Abdel-Kader Zaaf, broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks. Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molinès rode through alone. Zaaf did not agree with the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree. When he woke up, he realised that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he was not used to the alcohol. Behind the two North-African cyclists, Kübler had attacked, and left his rivals Raphaël Géminiani and Louison Bobet minutes behind. Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with Kübler.\nIn stage fifteen, it was still hot, and the riders were not motivated to race. They stopped during the race to cool down in the Mediterranean Sea, but were quickly ordered by Jacques Goddet to continue the race. The journalists that followed the race reported on this in a humorous way, and the organisation therefore fined them.\nIn the sixteenth stage, Ockers and Bobet finished shortly after Kübler. The Tour de France jury said Bobet came in second, and gave him the 30 seconds bonification time, but the Belgian team manager Sylvère Maes protested against this decision, because he argued that Ockers came in second. Maes threatened to take the Belgian team out of the race, but the Tour direction did not change their decision. In the end, the Belgian team stayed in the race.\nSecond placed rider in the general classification, Ockers was unable to win back time in later stages, so Kübler stayed in the lead for the rest of the race, and became the first Swiss winner of the Tour de France.\nKübler's victory is seen as partially his own accomplishment, but also partially due to the absence of Fausto Coppi and the withdrawal of the Italian teams. According to Kübler, it became more difficult to win the race after the Italians had left the race, because the attention was no longer focussed on the Italians, but on Kübler. Kübler felt that he would have been able to win the 1950 Tour de France if the Italians would have not abandoned, because he was the best in the time trials.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. The total prize money in the 1950 Tour de France was 14 million French Francs; 1 million French Francs were for the winner of the general classification. Of the 116 cyclists that started the 1950 Tour de France, 51 finished the race.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was the same as in 1949: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 5 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Louison Bobet won this classification after having led the classification almost the entire race, although he only reached 2 of the 14 mountain tops first.\nThe team classification was calculated by adding the times in the general classification of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the Belgian team, with a large margin over the French team. Of the other four teams that started, the two Italian teams had abandoned the race, and the North African team finished with only two riders and the Dutch team with only one rider, therefore they were ineligible for the team classification. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Lautaret on stage 19. This prize was won by Apo Lazaridès. The special award for the best regional rider was won by sixth-placed Kléber Piot.\nAftermath.\nThe French-Algerian cyclist Zaaf, who fell out in the thirteenth stage after riding into the wrong direction, became famous, and got to ride in many criteriums, until he left two years later to Algeria. Kübler did not enter the next three Tours de France, but when he returned in 1954, he finished in second place, and won the green jersey for the points classification."

        "text": "The 1948 Tour de France was the 35th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 30 June to 25 July 1948. It consisted of 21 stages over .\nThe race was won by Italian cyclist Gino Bartali, who had also won the Tour de France in 1938. Bartali had almost given up during the race, but drew inspiration from a phone call from the Italian prime minister, who asked him to win the Tour de France to prevent civil unrest in Italy after assassination attempt against Togliatti. Bartali also won the mountains classification, while the team classification was won by the Belgian team.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe prize for wearing the yellow jersey was introduced in 1948, sponsored by Les Laines, a French wool company.\nIn 1947, the media had complained that too many cyclists reached the end of the race, so the race was no longer heroic; this may have motivated a new rule between the third and the eighteenth stage, the rider last in the general classification was eliminated.\nWhereas the 1947 Tour de France had been France-centred, the 1948 race became a more cosmopolitan race.\nThe Tour visited the Saar protectorate for the first time when the 18th stage passed Saarbrücken and Saarlouis. A second visit took place in 1953.\nThe first live television broadcast from the Tour de France was in 1948, when the arrival at the velodrome of Parc des Princes was broadcast live.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1948 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams.\nAfter there had not been an official Italian team allowed in the previous edition, the Italians were back. The Italian cyclists were divided between Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi. Both argued in the preparation of the race about who would be the team leader. The Tour organisation wanted to have both cyclists in the race, so they allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team.\nIn the end, Coppi refused to participate, and Bartali became the team leader.\nThe organisation still allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team, but they were to be composed of young cyclists, and were named the Italy Cadets and the Belgium Aiglons.\nThe Tour organisation invited the Swiss to send a team, as they wanted Ferdinand Kübler, the winner of the 1948 Tour de Suisse, in the race. Kübler refused this because he could earn more money in other races. When the brothers Georges and Roger Aeschlimann announced that they wanted to join the race, they were quickly accepted, especially because they were from Lausanne, where the Tour would pass through. They were put in a team with eight non-French cyclists living in France, and were named the Internationals.\nTwelve teams of ten cyclists entered the race, consisting of 60 French cyclists, 24 Italian, 22 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 4 Luxembourgian, 2 Swiss, 1 Polish and 1 Algerian cyclist.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nBartali's three stage wins in a row was the last time that happened, until Mario Cipollini achieved four in a row in 1999. There were five rest days, in Biarritz, Toulouse, Cannes, Aix-les-Bains and Mulhouse. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 14.\nRace overview.\nAs the Italian team had not entered the Tours de France of 1939 and 1947, it was the first Tour de France for Bartali since his victory ten years before in 1938. His results in the Giro d'Italia had not been well, and it was not thought that Bartali could compete for the win.\nBartali however won the sprint in the first stage, and thanks to the bonification of one minute for the winner, he was leading the race. After that, the Italian team took a low profile in the race.\nIn the second stage, Bartali lost the lead already; although his teammate Vincenzo Rossello won the stage, Belgian Jan Engels took over the yellow jersey.\nIn the third stage, a group escaped and built up a lead of almost 14 minutes. Among that group was Louison Bobet, and as he was the best-placed cyclist in that group he became the next leader. Also in that group was Roger Lambrecht; when Lambrecht again was able to be in the first group in the fourth stage, he took the lead, becoming the fourth rider in four stages to don the yellow jersey. Lambrecht kept it in the next stage, but after Bobet won the sixth stage, Bobet took back the lead, and the yellow jersey made him confident. In the Pyrenées, Bartali won both stages in a sprint, but Bobet was near and became the hero of the French spectators.\nAfter the ninth stage, Bobet had built up a lead of more than nine minutes. In the tenth stage, he lost time, and Belgian cyclist Roger Lambrecht reduced the margin to 29 seconds. After the eleventh stage, Bobet was still in the lead, but was having problems, and after he fainted at the finish, he wanted to give up. After a meal, massage and sleeping, he changed his mind, and won the twelfth stage.\nAfter the twelfth stage, Bartali was 20 minutes behind. Bartali thought about quitting the tour, but was persuaded to race on. That night, Bartali received a phone call while he was in bed. Alcide De Gasperi, prime minister of Italy, from the Christian Democratic party, told him that a few days earlier Palmiro Togliatti, leader of the Italian Communist Party, had been shot, and Italy might be on the edge of a civil war.\nDe Gasperi asked Bartali to do his best to win a stage, because the sport news might distract people from the politics. Bartali replied that he would do better, and win the race.\nThe next day, Bartali won stage 13 with a large margin. In the general classification, he jumped to second place, trailing by only 66 seconds.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Bartali and Bobet rode together over the Galibier and the Croix de Fer, but Bartali had been saving his energy, and left Bobet and every body else behind on the Col de Porte. Bartali won again, and took over the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Bobet was now in second place, eight minutes behind. The next stage, stage 15, was also won by Bartali.\nThe sixteenth stage was not won by Bartali, but because his direct competitors lost time, he increased his lead to 32 minutes. Bartali lost minutes in the time trial in stage 17, but his lead was never endangered.\nWith each stage win of Bartali (seven in total), the Italian excitement about the Tour de France increased, and the political tensions quieted.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe budget of the Tour de France in 1948 was 45 million Francs, from which one third was provided by private enterprises. In total, 7 million Francs of prizes were awarded in the 1948 Tour de France. Of these, 600.000 Francs were given to Bartali for winning the general classification.\nBartali is the only cyclist to win two Tours de France ten years apart. Of the 120 cyclists, 44 finished the race.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.\nThere were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category A, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category B, gave 5 points to the first cyclist.\nThe team classification was calculated by adding the times in the general classification of the best three cyclists per team.\nThe Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange in the opening few kilometres of stage 1 at the summit of the in Versailles, Paris. This prize was won by Roger Lambrecht. The Tour de France in 1948 for the first time had a special award for the best regional rider. This was won by third-placed Guy Lapébie.\nAftermath.\nThe 1948 Tour de France first showed the strengths of Louison Bobet. Bobet would be the first rider to win three consecutive Tours de France, from 1953 to 1955. After the race, the Italian team manager Alfredo Binda said about Bobet: \"If I would have directed Bobet, he would have won the Tour.\"\nCoppi, who had not competed in the 1948 Tour de France because of his bad relationship with Bartali, would enter and win the 1949 Tour de France."

        "title": "Rugby union in Romania",
        "text": "Rugby union is a moderately popular team sport played in Romania with a tradition of more than 100 years. In past eras, the game had been more popular and Romanian national teams had been relatively highly ranked in world rugby, but their standing declined since the dawn of professionalism and the end of communism. The Romanian men's national team are currently 20th in the World Rugby Rankings as of 19 March 2023.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe game was introduced to Romania from France at the turn of the 20th century by students returning with rugby balls from their studies in Paris. Romanian rugby took root in Bucharest, established by students who had been to French universities, and by the capital's burgeoning middle class. Stadiul Român and seventeen other teams would be formed in Bucharest from 1913 onwards. The Romanian Rugby Championship was first contested in 1914. Romania played France for the first time in 1924.\nThe nation's first international was played against the USA in 1919, six years after the game was first introduced. In 1931, a governing body was formed, the Federaţia Română de Rugby.\nThe first team outside Bucharest was formed at an aircraft factory in Braşov in 1939.\nCommunist period.\nFor the first half of the 20th century, Romanian rugby was fairly isolated, having most of its contact with France, and (to an extent) the Iron Curtain in the second half did not help either. However, this \"isolation\" was broken when Rowe Harding took the Welsh team Swansea touring there to play national champions Locomotiva. On his return to the UK, Harding spoke highly of the Romanian game, speaking of its consistently high standard as well as of the passion of both the fans and the players, which he thought was unparalleled in Europe outside the Five Nations. The tour and Harding's praise effectively opened up Romanian rugby to the rest of western Europe, sparking a number of tours travelling to and from the country. In 1955, a Romanian side toured England and Wales, playing Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol and the Harlequins, winning one, drawing two, and losing one. Later in 1955, the Romanians defeated Llanelli in Moscow, and then beat both Cardiff and Harlequins in Bucharest. Only France, who played Romania in front of almost 95,000 fans in Bucharest (in a preliminary match to a soccer international), could beat the Romanians, and that was only after an epic 16-15 battle.\nA generation of French school-trained coaches from the late 1940s and 1950s laid the foundations for national success in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. In 1974, Romania won against France 15 – 10 in Bucharest, during the FIRA – Association of European Rugby championship. In 1975, Romania went on an 8-game tour to New Zealand, which concluded in Wellington with a 10-10 draw against the Junior All Blacks. Home nation sides began to award international caps for matches against Romania in 1981. Romania won rugby internationals over Scotland in 1984 and 1991, and also over Wales in 1983 and 1988 (the latter in Cardiff). Between 1960 and 1990, Romania beat France eight times, the most famous being in 1990 when the legendary French-based no. 8 Hari Dumitras led Romania to a 12-6 victory in Auch, France. Canadian second row Norm Hadley believed the 1991 Rugby World Cup game against Romania was more physically sapping than playing either France or New Zealand.\nThe former All Blacks scrum half Chris Laidlaw, writing at the end of the 1970s, saw rugby as a positive force in East-West relations at the time:\nChris Laidlaw writing of the open secret of shamateurism in Soviet sport said:\nPost-communism.\nAfter the fall of communism in 1989, Romanian rugby union suffered a dramatic financial shortfall. In 1995, the first ever Heineken Cup match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constanţa.\nRomania first got regular international competition when they joined the newly formed European Nations Cup in 2000. As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the European Rugby Shield.\nBucurești Rugby was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004. In recent years, they have achieved respectable results, including a win in 2010 against an Italian Super 10 side.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union in Romania is administered by the Romanian Rugby Federation (FRR), which was founded on 1st December 1912 as Federațiunea Societăților de Sport din România (FSSR).\nNational team.\nThe Romania national rugby union team, nicknamed The Oaks, has long been considered one of the stronger European teams outside the Six Nations tournament. It often takes part the Rugby World Cup, which is hosted every four years.\nRomania plays every year in the Rugby Europe Championship, a competition for second and third-tier European nations and have won the competition on three occasions (under the current format) in the 2000, 2001–2002 and 2005–2006 seasons.\nThe Antim Cup is contested between Romania and Georgia. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches. Romania has won the cup on six occasions in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2010 and in 2017.\nRomania has played at every World Cup so far (except for the 2019 tournament in Japan, as it was disqualified) and won at least one game at each World Cup (except for the 1995 and 2011 tournaments, where they lost all of its games).\nDomestic competition.\nThe Liga Națională de Rugby, which has been contested since 2010 in its current format, is the main domestic competition in Romania. It has been contested by many teams across the country since 1914. During the communist period in Romania, the competition had been dominated by Steaua București and Dinamo București; in recent years, the competition has been dominated by Știința Baia Mare and Rugby Timișoara.\nDomestic cup.\nThe Cupa României, which has been contested since 1914, is the main domestic cup in Romania that has also been contested by many teams across Romania along with the Liga Națională de Rugby. Like the domestic competition, the Cupa României had been dominated by Steaua București and Dinamo București; recently, however, the cup has been dominated by Știința Baia Mare and Rugby Timișoara. At present, only teams in the Liga Națională de Rugby can compete in the Cupa României since the gap between those teams and the ones in the Divizia Națională de Seniori, Romania's second-tier domestic championship, is ever-increasing.\nEuropean club tournaments.\nIn 1995, the first ever Heineken Cup match took place in Romania when Toulouse took on RCJ Farul Constanța. Since the inaugural season, Romanian teams have not taken part in the Heineken Cup.\nInstead of playing in the Heineken Cup, Romanian teams had qualified and took part in the European Challenge Cup nearly every single season since its inception apart from the 2000−01, 2003−04 seasons and 2004−05 seasons, where the Bucharest Wolves took part in the competition as an alternative to the team that would win the Liga Națională de Rugby.\nThe Bucharest Wolves was a team that was formed by the FRR as an alternative to the team that would win the Liga Națională de Rugby to play in European competitions (due to the decreasing levels of competitiveness from the Romanian teams in the Challenge Cup) and would consist of rugby union players playing in the domestic Romanian championship. They played in the European Shield in 2004−05 and have played in every single Challenge Cup between 2005 and 2014, when the team was ultimately dissolved in favour for the champions of Romania to represent Romania in European competitions instead.\nPopularity.\nIn the 1980s, the country reached its peak in the sport as the national team managed to defeat teams such as Wales, Scotland and France, who all played in the Five Nations Championship.\nNot only that, the national team would become more and more popular among Romanians and as a result, the country had more than 12,000 players playing rugby and 110 rugby clubs.\nYet, after the fall of communism, Romanian rugby union suffered a drastic financial shortfall. However, its popularity – which has never been comparable with that of football or handball – has not been diminished.\nAccording to World Rugby, Romania has 113 rugby union clubs and approximately 25,000 rugby players, 9,810 of which are registered players (most of these players are male and only a small fraction of these players are female)."

        "title": "Neal Martin (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Neal Martin (born September 8, 1975 in Sudbury, Ontario) is a Canadian retired ice hockey defenceman\nCareer.\nMartin began his Major Junior career with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the OHL, having been selected in the 5th round, 79th overall, in the 1992 OHL Priority Selection Draft. Martin played sparingly in his first season with the Greyhounds, logging only 17 regular season games. The team had an extended run in the play-offs, before losing the finals to the Peterborough Petes. Nevertheless, they qualified as hosts for the 1993 Memorial Cup, which they subsequently won. He began the 1993-94 with the Greyhounds, before being traded midway through the season to home-town team Sudbury Wolves. Martin found more ice time in Sudbury, and as a result his scoring increased. During the 1994-95 season, he registered 36 points in 62 games, whilst the following season saw him register 49 points in 51 games. Following the culmination of the 1995-96 season, Martin turned professional.\nThe Hampton Roads Admirals of the ECHL were Martin's first professional team, he played 54 games in the 1996-97 season, registering 22 points. In addition to his time in Norfolk, Martin also played a single game for both the AHL's Portland Pirates and the IHL's San Antonio Dragons. Martin remained in the ECHL for the following season, moving to the Mississippi Sea Wolves, where his production dipped slightly, tallying 14 points in 52 games as the Sea Wolves failed to make the playoffs. Following the season in Mississippi, Martin joined the Waco Wizards of the WPHL where he went on to have a career year, registering 54 points in 50 games. During the season he also had short stints with the Chicago Wolves and the Long Beach Ice Dogs, both of the IHL.\nAfter his success in Texas, Martin moved to the United Kingdom and signed with the London Knights of the BISL. It was a successful season, with Martin being named as a Second Team All-Star, and the Knights winning the British Championship. Martin re-signed with the Knights for the 2000-01 season. During his second season in the capital, Martin was named as an alternate captain, scored 25 points in 47 games, and was again named as a Second Team All-Star. Following his time in the United Kingdom, Martin moved to Germany in order to play for DEL side SERC Wild Wings. The Wild Wings finished last in the standings, and narrowly avoided relegation, despite this, Martin put up respectable numbers, scoring 25 points in 59 games. Martin remained with the Wild Wings for the following season, however, the team's fortunes didn't change, again finishing last in the league. Despite winning the play-down, the Wild Wings were relegated to the 2nd Bundesliga as they lost their license due to insolvency proceedings.\nFollowing the Wild Wings relegation, Martin moved across the border to Austria and played for Villacher SV of the EBEL for the 2003-04 season. It'd be a productive one, Martin scored 18 points in 47 games as VSV finished 3rd in the regular season. They made it to the play-off final before ultimately losing to EC KAC. During the season, Martin was named to the Canadian National Team for the 2003 Lotto Cup, held in Slovakia.\nMartin returned to the UK for the 2004-05 season, in order to play for the Coventry Blaze of the Elite Ice Hockey League, where he was named as an alternate captain. The EIHL was the new top-tier of the sport in the UK, following the collapse of the BISL. The team had a spectacular season, completing the British Grand Slam, after winning the regular season, Play-offs and Challenge Cup. Likewise, Martin had a strong season, scoring 15 points in 30 games and being selected as a First Team All-Star. Martin would increase his production during his second year in the Midlands, tallying 30 points in 40 games, and was again named as a First Team All-Star. His third season for the Blaze again saw increased scoring, this time registering 37 points in 50 games. The Blaze would win the regular season, and the challenge cup, with Martin once again being named as First Team All-Star. Martin returned for a fourth season in Coventry, increasing his scoring once again with 39 points in 49 games, and was named a First Team All-Star for the fourth consecutive time. The Blaze would again top the table in the regular season, and would also take home the short-lived Knock-out Cup. Following the culmination of the season, it was announced that after four years Martin would be leaving Coventry, to player for AaB Ice Hockey of the AL-Bank Ligaen.\nHis first season in Denmark was mixed, the team struggled, finishing 8th in the regular season and went out of the play-offs in the first round. Nevertheless, Martin managed to register 21 points in 42 games. AaB had a much better season in 2009-10, finishing 2nd in the league, before being swept in the play-off finals by SønderjyskE. Following his second year in Denmark, Martin retired from professional hockey.\nIn 2011, Martin was inducted to the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame as a result of his strong career in the UK.\nPersonal life.\nMartin's cousin is fellow professional hockey player Sean Blanchard, who also played for the London Knights. During Martin's time with the Blaze he attended Coventry University, graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Sports Management before studying for an MBA."

        "text": "Celebrity Bowling was an American syndicated bowling sports series hosted by Jed Allan that ran from January 16, 1971, to September 1978. The series was produced in Los Angeles at Metromedia Square, the studios of KTTV.\nEach week, the show featured four celebrities, on a pair of AMF or Brunswick lanes installed inside KTTV's studios, pitted against each other in teams of two. Victorious teams won prizes for home viewers, based upon the level of winning scores; there was an additional prize for the viewer associated with the team that bowled the most strikes.\nThe weekly series was a by-product of \"The Celebrity Bowling Classic\", a 90-minute TV special produced in 1969 for the Metromedia-owned stations, benefitting the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation. The series debuted at the same time the Prime Time Access Rule took effect, during which time a number of syndicated weekly programs went into production; its end came as weekly programs such as \"Celebrity Bowling\" were increasingly being replaced by twice-weekly and later stripped daily productions.\nJoe Siegman created the series, and he and Don Gregory produced 144 episodes for their 7-10 Productions.\nRules.\nFour celebrities played each game, separated into two pairs (usually each pair included one man and one woman). The rules of the game were known as \"best ball\"; for each frame, both members of each team would roll a ball on their own lane. If neither of the two teammates rolled a strike, then the person who rolled the worse shot (either a split or whoever knocked down the fewest pins) would then roll for the spare on the other lane. Players alternated lanes after each frame.\nEach team was tied to a person in the audience, who would win prizes based upon the score the pair accumulated in the game. The viewer would win increasingly valuable prizes, mostly home appliances, if a team scored 1, 120, 150, 180, or 210 points (with the highest category usually resulting in the viewer winning a car or vacation; the top category was reached only once in the show's history). A bonus prize would also be awarded to the audience member whose team bowled the most strikes. Another prize could be won for scoring a “Turkey” (three consecutive strikes).\nTo accommodate the half-hour time slot, the sixth and seventh frames of each game were typically not televised.\nCast.\nIn addition to Jed Allan, many episodes included a bowling analyst, including PBA star Dave Davis, PWBA standout Cheryl Robinson and bowling author/expert Don Russell.\nRevivals.\nIn 1987, 26 episodes of \"The New Celebrity Bowling\" were produced for national syndication. Jed Allan again hosted.\nIn 2008, TVS Television Network began producing \"Celebrity Bowling\" for TV syndication, using the AMF Lanes at the Silver Nugget Casino in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The host of the 2008 version was Las Vegas TV sports anchor Ron Futrell. 13 episodes were produced.\nAnother version called \"Stars &amp; Strikes\", produced by Don Gregory, was taped at the Lucky Strike bowling center inside L.A. Live, and was scheduled to air in the spring of 2011. The format was similar to the original, with an added twist that an audience member contestant could be called to bowl in place of a celebrity.\n\"All-Star Celebrity Bowling\", developed by comedian Chris Hardwick (whose father Billy was a world-class professional bowler) and hosted by Randy Sklar and Jason Sklar, was slated to air on AMC in 2014 but was canceled before making it to air as part of that channel's shift in focus toward scripted programs. The show is instead an internet-only show, and episodes can be found on YouTube.\nEpisode status.\nAll 144 episodes are presumed to exist, with syndication rights being held by the Peter Rodgers Organization. Episodes have aired on Decades, ESPN Classic, the Retro Television Network, My Family TV, and on the Roku device on the N2TV channel. Certain episodes are also available to watch on Hulu.\nAs of 2015, Weigel Broadcasting owns the broadcast rights to the series. Me-TV has made selected episodes available for streaming on their site on a weekly rotating basis. Selected episodes aired on Decades (a joint venture between Weigel and CBS) March 8–10, 2015, and as part of special \"binge\" weekends on October 3–4, 2015, and May 28–29, 2016.\nThe 2008 revival was available on TVS's Web site, TV4U, which shut down in 2012.\nAs of December 2017, the first three seasons were available via Amazon Prime Video. 48 episodes are available on Peter Rodgers Organization's official YouTube channel.\nThe first three seasons are currently available on Tubi.\nNotable scores.\nIn Episode 70, the team of Michael Cole and Tige Andrews scored a 266, just 34 pins shy of a perfect score of 300. Their game easily surpassed the 210 score needed to win a new car, which was the top prize at that time. Jed Allan remarked that the previous high score was a 206, which was reached by Greg Morris and John Beradino in Episode 10. Cole and Andrews recorded a \"mark\" (strike or spare) in every frame bowled, as did Morris and Beradino.\nThe lowest score recorded during the original series is presumed to be a 66 by the team of Charles Nelson Reilly and Robert Clary in Episode 142. Reference is made at the show close by Jed Allan to the pair having \"beaten\" the long-standing record of 67 which was bowled by two of the Lennon Sisters.\nWhile not a notable score, it is also noteworthy that Frankie Avalon, in Season 1 Episode 21, successfully converted the 5-7 split in the 10th frame.\nHome media.\nA three DVD set (containing fifteen episodes) was released on June 14, 2011 by S'More Entertainment. This was followed by a second volume later that year, which contained two episodes featuring the kids from \"The Brady Bunch\" playing, and a third volume of two episodes with comedians in 2012."

He made the NL All-Star team in 1984 with a .304 average at mid-season, but in 1987 torn knee ligaments limited him to only 56 games and he was traded to Houston after the season.

After that, his production slipped, with his batting average never again rising above .261, and plummeting as low as .236 in 1991. He retired following the 1992 season."

        "text": "Ian Kenneth Stewart (born April 5, 1985) is a former American professional baseball third baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nBaseball career.\nColorado Rockies.\nDrafted in the 2003 MLB draft first round out of La Quinta High School in Westminster, California, Stewart showed great promise in short-season rookie-league ball with the Casper Rockies in the Pioneer League. His .401 on-base percentage and .558 slugging average appeared to justify his first-round selection. In 2004, Stewart continued to progress in low-A ball at Asheville in the South Atlantic League with a .398 OBP and .594 SLG. \"Baseball America\" ranked him as the fourth best prospect in baseball behind Delmon Young, Félix Hernández and Joe Mauer.\nIn 2005, he began play in high-A ball in Modesto, California in the California League. He got off to a very slow start, hitting for a low average with little power. He went to extended spring training and came back to play with Modesto in June, 2005. Up until June 20, Stewart was hitting under .230 with few homers. However, Stewart rebounded later in the season and finished with a respectable .353 OBP and .497 SLG, although he showed a worrisome tendency to strike out.\nStewart played in the Arizona Fall League after the conclusion of the 2005 minor league season. Here, Stewart got off to a good start with impressive power. Unfortunately, he suffered a wrist injury while sliding into second base. The MRI showed limited damage, but any wrist injury is troublesome for a power hitter. He was shut down for the rest of the AFL.\nStewart was invited to the Colorado Rockies 2006 spring training. He began well, hitting six home runs and batting over .400 in the first few games. Stewart re-established himself as a power-hitting prospect, and the Rockies sent him to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the AA Texas League. Here Stewart began the season well, but fell into a slump that sent his average to .235 in mid-May before being sidelined with another injury. The injury was not serious, and Stewart only missed ten games. When he returned, Stewart improved noticeably and finished the season with a .351 on-base percentage and a .452 slugging average. In 2007, he was selected to the All-Star Futures Game.\nStewart had his contract purchased on August 11, 2007, when Jeff Baker was placed on the disabled list. He made his major league debut on that same day when he started the game at third base. He was hitless in 2 at-bats but scored a run after he was hit by a pitch. His first hit was a double off Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs on August 12. He hit his first major league home run, a grand slam on August 21, 2007, against Tony Armas Jr. of the Pittsburgh Pirates, making him only the second Rockie ever to hit a grand slam as his first major league home run.\nHe struggled early, striking out 28 times in his first 55 ABs, and was sent down to Colorado Springs to regain his hitting stroke. He found it once again, and was called back to the Majors on July 19. Stewart won the starting third base job when Garrett Atkins moved to first base in place for the injured Todd Helton.\nStewart received the NL Rookie of the Month award for his accomplishments in July 2008. He hit .432 with one home run, five doubles, eight runs scored and 15 RBIs in 12 games during the month of July. He also had a .614 slugging percentage and a .519 on-base percentage.\nAfter being the Rockies regular third baseman for most of 2009 and 2010, he split 2011 between the Majors and AAA. In parts of 5 seasons with the Rockies, he hit .236 with 54 home runs and 187 RBI in 432 games.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn December 8, 2011, Stewart was traded from the Colorado Rockies along with Casey Weathers to the Chicago Cubs for Tyler Colvin and DJ LeMahieu.\nHe started the season playing third base with occasional starts by Jeff Baker, another former Rockie. On July 16, 2012, Stewart underwent wrist surgery and was put on the 60-day disabled list. In 55 games he hit .201 with 5 home runs and 17 RBI.\nOn December 6, 2012, Stewart re-signed a 1-year $2 million deal with the Cubs. He played in 40 games with the AAA Iowa Cubs, hitting .168. In June 2013, Stewart was suspended ten games for making critical comments about the team on Twitter, which led to his release on June 25.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn July 5, 2013, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who assigned him to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. He hit just .174 in 27 games before he was released on August 12.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nOn January 22, 2014, Stewart signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Stewart won a bench role with the Angels after a strong spring training. He was designated for assignment on July 19, 2014.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn December 26, 2014, Stewart signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He was released by the team in June."

He began his professional career in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization and played for over a decade with the Houston Astros. Reynolds batted left-handed and threw right.\nEarly life.\nAs a senior at Reagan High School in , Reynolds was named the Greater Houston High School Athlete of the Year. That spring, he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft.\nMLB career.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nReynolds batted a solid .318 in his first professional season with the Gulf Coast League Pirates, but with no power, and he committed 25 errors on the field. His game improved substantially in all areas by , when he batted .299 with six home runs and logged a .957 fielding percentage while splitting the season at Double-A &amp; Triple-A.\nHe emerged as one of the Pirates' top minor league prospects, batting .294 over five minor league seasons when he made his major league debut in 1975. Reynolds spent the 1976 season in Triple-A with the Charleston Charlies before being called up in September when rosters expanded.\nSeattle Mariners.\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Grant Jackson from the New York Yankees with their eleventh pick in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. A month later, they traded Jackson to the Pirates for Reynolds and Jimmy Sexton.\nReynolds immediately became the starting shortstop in Seattle, where his light hitting usually had him at or near the bottom of the M's batting order. His lack of strikeouts and ability to move runners over, however, landed him in the second spot early in the 1978 season. He was batting .306 with three home runs, 29 RBI and 27 runs scored at the All-Star break; he was the Mariners' sole representative on the American League squad, but did not appear in the game. After the season, he was acquired by his hometown Houston Astros in exchange for future AL strikeout champion Floyd Bannister.\nHouston Astros.\nAfter Garry Templeton declined his invitation to the 1979 All-Star Game, National League manager Tommy Lasorda added Reynolds to his team. As a result, Reynolds became the only shortstop in MLB history to be selected to the AL and NL squads in consecutive seasons. He batted .265 his first season with the Astros, but more importantly, he helped solidify the Houston infield with a .965 fielding percentage. After the season, he was presented with the Danny Thompson Memorial Award for exemplifying Christian spirit in the Major Leagues. \"When you receive an award like that, you’re humbled by it,\" Reynolds said.\nReynolds suffered through a subpar season. That same year, however, the Astros won their first division crown in franchise history. On May 16, , Reynolds tied the major-league record with three triples in one game and led the NL with a dozen three-baggers that season. He ended the season tied for the league lead with the San Diego Padres' Gene Richards with twelve in spite of the strike-shortened season.\nHe played with the Astros for eleven seasons, finishing second only to Roger Metzger in all-time games played at shortstop for the franchise.\nAfter baseball.\nIn retirement he entered the world of wealth management in Houston, partnering with former Astros teammate Terry Puhl.\nReynolds currently serves as a pastor at Second Baptist Church North Campus in Houston.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)"

The song was a success in the United States, reaching number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart on August 30, 1980, where it stayed for one week. The song also won Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Arrangement of the Year, and helped Cross win the Best New Artist award. VH1 named \"Sailing\" the most \"softsational soft rock\" song of all time.\nThe song was recorded in 1979, utilizing the 3M Digital Recording System, making it one of the first digitally recorded songs to chart. In his Grammy acceptance speech, Cross acknowledged \"Sailing\" as his favorite song on the album and that originally it was not meant to be a single. The song was later identified as an archetype of the style that later became known as yacht rock (At the time Cross and similar artists referred to the style as the West Coast sound).\nBackground.\nCross has said in interviews that the song's inspiration was his friendship with an older friend from his high school, Al Glasscock, who would take him sailing as a teenager, just to get away from the trials and tribulations of being a teenager. Glasscock functioned as a surrogate older brother during a tough time for Cross emotionally. Although Cross lost touch with Glasscock, \"The Howard Stern Show\" in April 1995 reunited the two after 28 years. Cross acknowledged on the show that his sailing trips with Glasscock had been the inspiration for the song. After that reunion, Cross sent Glasscock a copy of the platinum record he earned for selling more than five million copies of \"Sailing.\""

The race featured 128 riders, of which 81 finished, and was won by the Italian Gastone Nencini.\nBecause Jacques Anquetil was absent after winning the 1960 Giro d'Italia, Roger Rivière became the main favourite. Halfway the race, Rivière was in second place behind Nencini, and with his specialty the time trial remaining, he was still favourite for the victory. When Rivière had a career-ending crash in the fourteenth stage, this changed, and Nencini won the Tour easily.\nTeams.\nThe 1960 Tour de France was run in the national team format. The four most important cycling nations of the time, Spain, Belgium, France and Italy, each sent a national team with fourteen cyclists. There were also five smaller national teams: a combined Luxembourg/Swiss team, a Dutch team, a West German team, a British team, and a team of Internationals cyclists, all with eight cyclists. Finally, there were five regional teams, also of eight cyclists each. Altogether, 128 cyclists started the race. The West German team, that had been away from the Tour since 1938, was allowed to join again.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nJacques Anquetil, the winner of the 1957 Tour de France, had won the 1960 Giro d'Italia earlier that year. Anquetil was tired, and skipped the Tour. This made Roger Rivière the French team leader, and the big favourite for the Tour victory.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1960 Tour de France started on 26 June in Mulhouse, and had one rest day, in Millau. In previous years, the location of the stage finish and the next stage start had always been close together. In 1960, this changed, when cyclists had to take the train to get from Bordeaux to Mont de Marsan after the ninth stage. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was split in two parts. In the first part, a group of fourteen cyclists cleared from the rest, and won with a margin of over two minutes. In the second part, an individual time trial, Roger Rivière won. The lead in the general classification transferred to Nencini, who had been part of the group of fourteen cyclists. Federico Bahamontes, winner of the 1959 Tour, became ill and left the race in the second stage.\nNencini lost the lead in the third stage to Joseph Groussard. In the fourth stage, a group including Henri Anglade escaped, and Anglade became the new leader. Anglade had already finished in second placed in 1959, and expected to be the team leader now.\nIn the sixth stage, Rivière attacked. Only Nencini, Hans Junkermann and Jan Adriaensens could follow. Anglade asked his team manager Marcel Bidot to instruct Rivière to stop his attack, because Nencini and Adriaensens were dangerous opponents. Rivière ignored this, and continued. They beat the rest by almost fifteen minutes, and Adriaensens took over the lead in the general classification. After the stage, Anglade said that the French team lost the Tour in that stage. Anglade knew that Rivière would try to stay close to Nencini in the mountains, and warned that Rivière would regret staying close to Nencini downhill.\nThe first mountains were climbed in the tenth stage. Nencini won time in the descent from the Col d'Aubisque, where Adriaensens could not follow. After the Aubisque, Adriaensens worked together with his teammate Jef Planckaert to win back time, but Nencini was able to stay away from them, and became the new leader, with Rivière in second place, only 32 seconds behind.\nNencini gained one minute on Rivière in the eleventh stage, but Rivière knew he had the stronger team. Moreover, Rivière was at that moment the holder of the hour record, and knew he would win back enough time in the time trial in stage 19.\nIn the fourteenth stage, descending the Col de Perjuret, Rivière followed Nencini, considered one of the best descenders in the peloton but misjudged a turn and went off a cliff. Rivière broke his back in the fall, and never raced again.\nBecause of this, Jan Adriaensens climbed to the second place in the general classification, and he now was the main competitor for Nencini. Adriaensens lost time in the Pyrenees, and the Italians were able to put Graziano Battistini in second place. In the last stages, there was no competition for the overall victory, because it was clear that Nencini's advantage was too large. Therefore, all cyclists put their energy to win the remaining stages. For the points classification, Jean Graczyk had built a large lead, but the mountains classification was only clinched by Imerio Massignan in the final mountain stage.\nIn the twentieth stage, news came that Charles de Gaulle, the president, would be by the route at Colombey-les-deux-Églises, where he lived. The organisers, Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan asked the French national champion, Henry Anglade, if the riders would be willing to stop. Anglade agreed and the news was spread through the race. One rider, Pierre Beuffeuil had stopped to repair a tyre and knew nothing of the plan, being three minutes behind the race. When he reached Colombey, he found the race halted in front of him. He decided to pass all the waiting cyclists and continued alone, and won the stage alone on the boulevard Jules-Guesde by 49 seconds. \"I voted for de Gaulle\", he said.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1960 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification; it was calculated by adding for each cyclist he times that he required to finish each stage. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe points classification was calculated differently than in the years before. The top six cyclists of each stage received points; the winner 10 points, down to 1 point for the 6th cyclist. Because only a few cyclists received points, in the first stages of the Tour the lead was shared by up to 5 cyclists. In stage 4, when Jean Graczyk won the stage, he took the leading, having finished second in the stage 2. Graczyk remained leader for the rest of the race. The leader of the points classification was identified by the green jersey.\nThe mountains classification was calculated by adding the points given to cyclists for reaching the highest point in a climb first. There was no jersey associated to this classification in 1960.\nFinally, the team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the French team. For the smaller teams (made of 8 cyclists), a separate classification was made, here the Dutch team won. The Great Britain team and the Internationals did not finish with three cyclists, so were not included in the team classification.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Jean Graczyk won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Lautaret on stage 17. This prize was won by Graczyk.\nAftermath.\nRivière survived the crash, but his career as a professional cyclist was over. The drug palfium was found in his pockets, and it was thought that it had so numbed Riviere's fingers so that he couldn't feel the brake levers.\nNencini had his bouquet of flowers given to Rivière."

        "text": "The 1958 Tour de France was the 45th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 26 June to 19 July. The total race distance was 24 stages over .\nThe yellow jersey for the leader in the general classification changed owner a record 11 times, and only at the penultimate stage in the time trial the decision was made, when Gaul created a margin of more than three minutes.\nIn the final sprint, sprinter André Darrigade, who had already won five stages, collided with a stage official, who eleven days later died because of his injuries.\nTeams.\nIn 1958, 120 cyclists entered, divided into 10 teams of 12 cyclists each. France, Italy, Belgium and Spain each sent a national team. The Netherlands and Luxembourg had a combined team, as had Switzerland and West Germany. There was also one \"Internationals\" team, consisting of cyclists from Austria, Portugal, Great Britain and Denmark. There were also three regional French teams: Centre-Midi, West/South-West and Paris/North-East.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe French team had had some problems with the selection, as Jacques Anquetil, the winner of the 1957 Tour de France, did not want to share leadership with Louison Bobet, winner in 1953, 1954 and 1955. Anquetil had been so superior in 1957, that he did not want Bobet and Géminiani both in his team. The French team selector then chose to include Bobet in the national team. Raphael Géminiani, who had been in the French national team since 1949, was demoted into the regional Centre-Midi team. Géminiani was not pleased, and sent the French team director Marcel Bidot a \"jack-ass\" named \"Marcel\" to express his displeasure.\nCharly Gaul, was part of a Dutch / Luxembourg team and agreed to share his prizes with the team in exchange for their support.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1958 Tour de France started on 26 June. Whereas there had been two rest days in recent years, the 1958 Tour had no rest days at all. For the first time, the first mountain climbs were broadcast live on television. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 20.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage left in Brussels, to celebrate Brussel's World Fair. In the first stages, Luxembourgian climber Charly Gaul struggled, and lost considerable time in flat stages.\nDuring a break in the sixth stage, Anquetil and Bobet were left behind. Géminiani was in the leading group, and gained more than ten minutes on his rivals. After the sixth stage, Gerrit Voorting was in first place, followed by François Mahé from the French national team, and Géminiani.\nIn the seventh stage, Arigo Padovan won the sprint from Brian Robinson. The jury however relegated Padovan to second place for irregular sprinting, and Robinson became the first British winner of a stage.\nThe ninth stage again saw a large breakaway, this time including Darrigade. Darrigade won the sprint, and because the next group was more than 10 minutes behind, he became the new leader.\nGéminiani and the French national team were still on bad terms. When Gastone Nencini, a threat to both, had escaped and the national team members asked Géminiani to help them to get Nencini back, Géminiani refused.\nThe Pyrénées were visited in stage 13. Darrigade was not able to keep up with the leaders, and lost the lead. Bahamontes had tried to escape but failed, and later Gaul tried to escape, but he also failed. The favourites finished together, and Géminiani became the new leader; Vito Favero was only three seconds behind him.\nIn the fourteenth stage, also in the Pyrenees, Bahamontes escaped again, and this time he managed to stay away and win. Géminiani finished in the next group, but because Favero won the sprint for the second place, he received 30 seconds bonification time, and became the new leader.\nIn the fifteenth stage, Favero again finished second, and extended his lead again by 30 seconds.\nIn the eighteenth stage, a mountain time trial, Gaul won back time, and jumped from sixth place to third place in the general classification. Géminiani jumped back to the first place in that stage. In the nineteenth stage, over the Alps, Gaul had mechanical problems, and lost ten minutes. Second-placed rider Favero was now at a margin of more than three minutes.\nIn the twentieth stage, again in the Alps, Bahamontes finished first. Gaul lost a few seconds to Géminiani in that stage, so after the twentieth stage, Gaul was more than sixteen minutes behind Géminiani. With only a few stages left, Géminiani appeared to be able to win the race.\nIn stage 21, the weather conditions were bad. Before the stage started, Gaul told Bobet that he would attack on the first climb of the day, which he did. Bahamontes followed him, but let himself drop back because the weather was too bad and the finish was still far away. Gaul continued on his own, and his margin with the next cyclist kept growing. Géminiani now asked the French national team to help him, but they could not help and did not want to help. Géminiani forgot to take food in the food zone, and was hungry in the last part of the stage. In the end, Gaul won the stage almost 8 minutes ahead of the next rider. Favero came in third, more than ten minutes later, and Géminiani seventh more than 14 minutes behind. Favero was again first in the general classification, with Géminiani only 39 seconds behind in second place and Gaul 67 seconds behind in third place. After that stage, Géminiani accused the French team of treason, because he said it was due to their attacks that he lost the lead. Because of the extraordinary circumstances, the time limits were not enforced that stage. Second-placed rider Favero was now at a margin of more than three minutes.\nStage 22 was flat, and the favourites stayed together. This meant that the time trial in stage 23 would be decisive.\nIn that time trial, Gaul was the first of these three to start. Gaul set the winning time, and Géminiani and Favero lost more than three minutes, so Gaul took the lead in the general classification. Anquetil, who felt sick and was behind in the general classification, did not start that stage.\nThe last stage traditionally saw no problems for the leader, and Gaul became the first Luxembourgian cyclist since 1928 to win the Tour. In the final sprint in the last stage in the Parc des Princes, André Darrigade was in first position when he collided with Constant Wouters, the 70-year-old secrétaire-général of the stadium, who was attempting to prevent photographers encroaching on the track. Darrigade needed five stitches, but Wouters injuries were more serious, and he died eleven days later.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.The yellow jersey changed hands eleven times, the most ever. Gaul had an average speed of 36.919 km/h, which was a new record. Of the 120 cyclists that started the 1958 Tour de France, 78 finished the race.\nThe points classification was calculated by adding the stage ranks of each cyclist.\nThe mountains classification was calculated by adding the points given to cyclists for reaching the highest point in a climb first.\nThe team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the Belgian team, with a large margin over the Italian team.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Federico Bahamontes won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Lautaret on stage 21. This prize was won by Piet van Est."

        "title": "1956 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1956 Tour de France was the 43rd edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 5 to 28 July. It consisted of 22 stages over .\nThere was no previous Tour winner competing for the 1956 Tour, which had only previously happened in 1903 and 1927. An unknown rider from a regional team, Roger Walkowiak on the Northeast-Center French team, ended up winning the Tour. Many Tour fans dismissed the win as being lucky or unworthy at the time, which Walkowiak took hard; this made him not often speak of his win.\nThe Tour was ridden at the fastest average speed so far, over 36 km/h. Walkowiak became only the second rider, after Firmin Lambot in the 1922 Tour de France, to win without taking a single stage.\nInnovations.\nIn the previous years, a flat tyre had to be repaired, but from 1956 on, it was allowed to change wheels.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1956 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. Seven national teams were sent, with 10 cyclists each from France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Luxembourg/Mixed (the latter a combined team of seven Luxembourgian cyclists added with one Portuguese, one British and one Italian cyclist). France additionally sent five regional teams from 10 cyclists each, divided into North-East/Centre, South-East, West, Île-de-France and South-West. In total, 120 cyclists started the race.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the three previous editions, Louison Bobet, was absent because he had surgery. Because there were less climbs and no mountain top finishes, cycling experts expected this edition to be too easy. No other former Tour de France winner started the race. This was the third time in history that the race started without former winners, after the initial 1903 Tour de France and the 1927 Tour de France.\nBecause Bobet was not there, the race was open, and there were many riders thought able to win the Tour. The most favourite of these was probably Charly Gaul, who had won the 1956 Giro d'Italia, although he was in a weak team, and would also be aiming for the mountains classification.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1956 Tour de France started on 5 July, and had two rest days, in Bordeaux and Aix-les-Provence. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 17.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage was won by André Darrigade, one of the best sprinters of that time. In the third stage, a small group escaped and finished with a margin of fifteen minutes; Gilbert Desmet became the new leader. The time trial of stage four was won by Gaul. In the second part of the fourth stage, Roger Hassenforder escaped, and a took a group with him, including Darrigade. Desmet was not in that group, and lost more than 15 minutes, which made Darrigade leader again.\nIn the seventh stage, the peloton broke in two, and a large group of 31 cyclists finished more than 18 minutes ahead. This group included Roger Walkowiak, who had also been in the escaped group in the fourth stage, and became the new leader. Walkowiak's team manager, Sauveur Ducazeaux, advised Walkowiak that it would be too tough to try to remain the leader for the rest of the race, and suggested that Walkowiak lose the first place, and aim to regain it later in the race. In the tenth stage, Walkowiak lost time, and Gerrit Voorting who had also been part of the large breakaway group in stage seven, became the new leader. Voorting lost the lead in the next stage to Darrigade, who himself lost the lead to Jan Adriaensens in the twelfth stage.\nIn the fifteenth stage, the entire Belgian team was weak. Most Tour followers thought it was due to a doping practice that went wrong, but officially it was attributed to food poisoning. Adriaensens lost more than nine minutes, which made Wout Wagtmans the new leader. During the seventeenth stage, there was yet another escape, which included leader Wagtmans and Walkowiak, in fifth position in the general classification. The riders in second, third and fourth place were not in the escape, so Walkowiak moved up to the second place, more than four minutes behind Wagtmans. The eighteenth stage was the last chance for the climbing specialists to win back time, and so Gaul, Bahamontes and Ockers were aiming to win back time. Gaul escaped, and won the stage alone, with Ockers in second place. During the last climb, Bahamontes dismounted and threw his bike down the ravine, wanting to stop the race. The Spanish team was able to retrieve the bike, and convince Bahamontes to continue. Bahamontes finished the race in the group behind Ockers. The surprise of the day was that Walkowiak had been able to remain with Bahamontes, whereas Wagtmans (normally a decent climber) lost eight minutes more. Walkowiak took the first place in the general classification, with a margin of almost 4 minutes to Gilbert Bauvin.\nIn the time trial of stage 20, Bauvin performed very well, finishing in fifth place. Walkowiak ended in 24th place, but this was enough to keep a 1'25\" lead. In the 21st stage, Roger Hassenforder won his fourth stage of this Tour, after a solitary breakaway of 187 km.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 120 cyclists that started the 1956 Tour de France, 88 finished the race.\nThe points classification in 1956 was calculated in the same way as since the introduction in 1953, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1956, this was won by Stan Ockers with 280 points. Over 22 stages (including one split stage), this meant that his average stage finish was approximately place 13.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was almost the same as in 1955: there were three types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Charly Gaul won this classification.\nThe team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the Belgian team, with a large margin over the Italian team. Every team finished with at least three cyclists, so all teams were included in the team classification.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. André Darrigade won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. After every stage, the jury also gave a prize to the cyclist with the most bad luck. The award for most bad luck during the entire Tour de France went to Fernand Picot. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point on stage 2 in village of Cysoing in the far north, marking 200,000 kilometres travelled in Tour de France history. This prize was won by Pierre Pardoën.\nAftermath.\nThe cycling fans had not been happy to see unknown Walkowiak win the race, and he was not cheered for when the race finished in the Parc des Princes. Walkowiak was considered an unworthy winner, and never again was able to repeat such a win. His name entered the French language in the phrase \"á la Walko\", which means \"won by an undeserving or unknown rider\".\nThe press gave many reasons for Walkowiak's victory: the France national team had had internal problems, Gaul and Bahamontes had been occupied with the mountains classification and Ockers with the team classification.\nNot all considered him unworthy; Five-time Tour winner Bernard Hinault praised his win saying: \"There are people who say that Walkowiak should not have won the Tour. They should have been on that Tour! He took the jersey, he lost it and he regained it. He was not a thief. The Tour is not a gift\".\nWalkowiak was unhappy about how the people reacted to his Tour win, and for many years did not want to discuss it.\nThe French team manager Marcel Bidot later criticized Darrigade for not helping Bauvin in the last stages; he thought that with the help of Darrigade, Bauvin might have been able to win back the 85 seconds on Walkowiak and win the race.\nThis was the final Tour for Belgian rider Stan Ockers, who died in a tragic accident during a track race just a few months after this Tour ended. Of the ten Tours held after World War II, Ockers had entered eight, finished all in the top ten each time except in 1948 when he finished 11th. Ockers had won the points classification in 1955 and 1956."

The race was won by Louison Bobet, the last of his three consecutive wins.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1955 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. Eight national teams were sent, with 10 cyclists each from France, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, and a mixed team consisting of Luxembourgian, Austrian, West German and Australian cyclists. France additionally sent five regional teams from 10 cyclists each, divided into Île-de-France, North-East/Centre, West, South-East and South-West. In total, 120 cyclists started the race. The mixed team included cyclists from West-Germany, which was the first time since the Second World War that German cyclists rode the Tour. The Great Britain team was the first British team in Tour history.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nLouison Bobet, the winner of the 1953 Tour de France and the 1954 Tour de France, had done an aggressive preparation in the early season before the Tour de France, aiming for his third victory. Bobet was the main favourite, also because he was the world champion.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1955 Tour de France started on 7 July, and had two rest days, in Monaco and Ax-les-Thermes. The 1955 Tour saw the introduction of the photo finish. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 8.\nRace overview.\nThe first part of the first stage was won by Miguel Poblet, who became the first Spanish cyclist to wear the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.\nThe second and third stage saw small groups escaping from the peloton. In both stages, Wout Wagtmans and Antonin Rolland, one of Bobet's teammates, were present. Wagtmans became leader of the general classification, with Rolland in second place.\nThe first attack that was important for the general classification was in the fourth stage. Rolland was part of a group of nine cyclists that finished seven minutes before the rest. Rolland was the best-placed cyclist of those nine, and took the lead.\nIn the seventh stage, Rolland briefly lost that lead, because a group including Wim van Est escaped and gained more than seventeen minutes, which was just enough for Van Est to take over the lead. Van Est was sure to lose it in the next stage, which included high mountains.\nIn that eighth stage, Charly Gaul attacked early in the stage. Gaul was more than 23 minutes behind in the general classification, but got over the mountains quickly and won with 13 minutes, which put him in third place.\nIn the ninth stage, Gaul tried to do the same again, and got over the first three mountains alone. But because of a crash on the second mountain he lost time, and did not win the stage; instead he even lost a few minutes. During the eleventh stage, French cyclist Jean Malléjac collapsed and remained unconscious for 15 minutes. The Tour doctor who helped recognised that Malléjac's symptoms were identical to an amphetamine overdose, and told the team doctors to be more careful with doping. In that stage, Bobet got away on Mont Ventoux and nobody was able to follow him. He reached the top alone, and from there descended to the finish, 6 minutes ahead of Rolland, who was still the race leader. Bobet jumped to second place in the general classification.\nThe next challenge for the general classification were the Pyrénees mountains. In stage 17, Gaul made the pace, and most cyclists could not follow. Bobet could hold on for a long time, but at the finish lost 84 seconds to Gaul. Because Rolland lost more than seven minutes, Bobet took the lead.\nIn the eighteenth stage, it was again Gaul who attacked. This time, a small group including Bobet could follow him all the way. Rolland finished two minutes later, but was still in second place in the general classification.\nThe time trial in the 21st stage was won by Jean Brankart, who jumped to second place in the general classification. Rolland lost more than nine minutes, and dropped to the fifth place in the general classification.\nBobet remained the leader, and his lead was not challenged in the last stage. Bobet became the first person in the Tour de France to win three Tours in a row.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe points classification was calculated in the same way as in 1954, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1955, this was won by Stan Ockers.\nPoints for the mountains classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system was almost the same as in 1954: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Charly Gaul won this classification.\nThe team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the French team. The British team and the regional South West team finished with only two cyclists, so they were not eligible for the team classification.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Gaul won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera on stage 10. This prize was won by André Darrigade."

Like its predecessor, it was one of the few titles released on the J-Cart format, which provides two additional controller ports for multiplayer games. The game was followed by \"Pete Sampras Tennis '97\", which was released for the PlayStation and personal computers.\nFeatures.\nIt was endorsed by Pete Sampras, one of the best-known tennis players of the late 20th century. The game is pretty standard tennis sim fare. It features a first-person behind-the-back view of the court with player's choice of multiple male or female players and pick of several different styles of play - including head-to-head and mixed doubles.\nDescription.\nThe Europe-only sequel to \"Pete Sampras Tennis\", \"Sampras Tennis 96\" includes new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joining the previously available grass, clay and hard courts.\nChanges to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction.\nThe large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder). There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament (\"Party mode\" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots)."

        "text": "The World Matchplay, also known as the Betfred World Matchplay for sponsorship purposes, is a professional and one of three legs of the Triple Crown. It is played in a legs format, and is run by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Nathan Aspinall is the current champion after winning the 2023 edition.\nHistory.\nThe World Matchplay has been played annually since 1994 in the Empress Ballroom at the Winter Gardens, Blackpool. The first ever winner was Larry Butler, who beat Dennis Priestley 16–12, and the current holder is Nathan Aspinall. \nThe 1995 World Matchplay turned out to be Jocky Wilson's last appearance in a major televised event. Wilson had reached the quarter-finals of the inaugural tournament in 1994 and he beat Rod Harrington in the 1st round in 1995, but a 2nd round defeat against Nigel Justice was effectively the end of his career.\nFrom 1994 to 2012, matches at the World Matchplay had to be won by two clear legs. For example, the first round was usually played over the first to 10 legs, but if the score reached 9–9, play continued until either player gained a two-leg lead. Starting with the 2013 World Matchplay, if a two leg-lead hadn't been established after six extra legs, then a sudden death leg is played, so sudden death would come into play in a first round match at 12–12.\nOver the course of the tournament's 29-year existence, there have been twelve different winners: Phil Taylor (16), Michael van Gerwen (3), Rod Harrington (2), Gary Anderson (1), Larry Butler (1), Rob Cross (1), Peter Evison (1), Colin Lloyd (1) James Wade (1), Peter Wright (1), Dimitri Van den Bergh (1) and Nathan Aspinall (1) . Dennis Priestley was also runner-up for three consecutive years.\nFrom 2018 onwards, the World Matchplay champion will receive the Phil Taylor Trophy, as was announced by the PDC following the retirement of the sixteen-time winner of the tournament.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the 2020 World Matchplay was held at the Marshall Arena, Milton Keynes, behind closed doors.\nRecords and statistics.\nNine-dart finishes.\nEight nine-dart finishes have been thrown at the World Matchplay. The first one was in 2002, when Phil Taylor hit the first live 9-darter in UK television history.\nAverages.\nAn average over 100 in a match in the PDC World Matchplay has been achieved 142 times, of which Phil Taylor is responsible for 62. In 2010, Phil Taylor became the first player to average over 100 in all five rounds of the tournament. He repeated this feat in 2011 and 2013.\nAn average of over 105 in a match in the World Matchplay has been achieved 35 times, of which Phil Taylor is responsible for 24. The highest match average ever in the World Matchplay is 114.99 by Phil Taylor in his Last 32 victory over Barrie Bates in 2010. The highest match average ever in the World Matchplay Final is 111.23 by Phil Taylor against Adrian Lewis in 2013.\nFormat.\nFrom the beginning of the tournament in 1994, the World Matchplay has always been a legs only event. The length of matches for each round has changed several times over the years, as shown below.\nMedia coverage.\nThe World Matchplay has been broadcast in the UK by Sky Sports since the first tournament.\nSponsors.\nThere have been seven different sponsors for the World Matchplay:"

        "title": "WWF Royal Rumble (1993 video game)",
        "text": "WWF Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling video game released in 1993 for the Super NES and Sega Genesis. Like its predecessor, \"WWF Super WrestleMania\", it is based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It features a variety of match types, including the newly added Royal Rumble match. The game's roster consists of wrestlers who were top stars in the WWF at the time, and each version of the game has five exclusive playable characters.\nThe game boasts several new features, including an on-screen meter grappling meter and steel chairs that can be used as weapons. \"Royal Rumble\" also adds a variety of new moves, including illegal tactics such as choking and each wrestler's signature finishing moves.\nThe game was followed up with the Sega CD release \"WWF Rage in the Cage\" and a direct sequel, \"WWF Raw\".\nGameplay.\n\"WWF Royal Rumble\" carries over the \"tug-of-war\" style grappling system from the previous game, this time adding an on-screen meter to show who has the advantage in a grapple and how close they are to executing a move. Players may strike their opponent with steel chairs found outside the ring. After knocking the referee temporarily unconscious, one may use illegal tactics such as choking and eye raking. To better avoid losing via count out, wrestlers may also roll into the ring from the bottom side; ring entry was previously only possible through the left and right sides. In addition adding more moves to the basic moveset (including the body splash, knee drop, backbreaker, and atomic drop), \"WWF Royal Rumble\" includes signature finishing moves for each wrestler. \"Mega\" placed the game at #40 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.\nMatch types.\nIn a One-on-One match, two wrestlers (one player versus the computer or two players) square off for a face-to-face bout. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament variations are available. One Fall matches feature an in-ring referee and are contested under standard rules. Victory is achieved by a 3-count pinfall or a count-out if a wrestler stays outside of the ring for a full 10 count. In a Brawl, however, the referee is absent. This allows unlimited time outside the ring and illegal moves such as eye raking and choking are allowed at all times. The Brawl match does not require a pinfall to win; instead, the first player to be entirely drained of his stamina submits in defeat. In a Tournament, a player must battle through the entire roster in a series of One Fall matches to win the championship belt.\nA Tag Team match is made up of two teams of two wrestlers (if two players are involved, they can choose to either control opposite teams or be on the same team against the computer). Whenever one wrestler gets tired, they can tag in their partner. A wrestler on the apron can grab an opponent if they get close to the ropes, allowing their partner to attack them. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament configurations are available. The same rules for the singles One Fall and Brawl matches apply to tag team matches. In the tag team Tournament mode, either one player or two cooperative players will choose two wrestlers to form a team and then must defeat the remaining wrestlers in a series of One Fall tag team matches to win the tag team championship.\nA Triple Tag Team match is similar to a Tag Team match, except instead of two wrestlers to a team, there are three wrestlers on each team. Only one partner for each team appears on the apron at a time. The player can switch outside partners by pressing a button. One Fall and Brawl options are available (with one player or two players head-to-head), with the same rules as singles and tag team matches.\nThe Royal Rumble begins with two wrestlers, and more adversaries enter until six wrestlers are in the ring. Additional wrestlers enter as others are eliminated. There are no holds barred, and elimination occurs when a wrestler is thrown out of the ring. A wrestler must be worn down before they can be thrown out, unless they're caught running with a hip toss or knocked off of the top turnbuckle. The last wrestler remaining in the ring after all twelve have entered wins the match. At the end of a Royal Rumble, score rankings are shown giving a wrestler's total time in the ring along with a list of opponents they eliminated.\nRoster differences.\nThe SNES and Genesis versions were released three months apart, with each version having several exclusive wrestlers. The two versions share seven wrestlers: Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Razor Ramon, Randy Savage, Crush, and \"The Narcissist\" Lex Luger. The five remaining members of the roster differ between versions. The SNES version features Ric Flair, Mr. Perfect, Ted DiBiase, Yokozuna, and Tatanka. The Genesis version replaces them with Hulk Hogan, IRS, \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, \"The Model\" Rick Martel and Papa Shango.\nReception.\nThe game has received \"mixed to positive\" reviews from critics. Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game a score of 82 out of 100. Hyper gave both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis versions an 84%."

        "title": "Backyard golf",
        "text": "Backyard golf is a lawn game played in the United States. The game is very similar to golf; however, it uses fewer clubs (i.e. sand wedge, pitching wedge, and nine iron). The balls are wiffleballs that are often covered with electrical, duct, or masking tape. The courses typically consist of one central hole location where different tee boxes constitute different \"holes.\" Most courses have nine holes, although larger yards have been known to have 18 or 36 holes. The game is very easy to play as it requires minimal technical skill. The large size of the ball and short distance of the holes make backyard golf conducive to casual play.\nThe whereabouts of the game's origins remain unclear. It is entirely probable that the game was \"invented\" many times in many locations as a fun game in the vein of horseshoes, shuffleboard, or croquet. The game is very popular in Western Massachusetts where organized tournaments have occurred.\nA relatively famous permanent course exists in Ludlow, Massachusetts on Chapin Street. It is known as the Ancient Nine or Lavoie Course. It is the only known course where the public is welcome to play the game on private property free of charge during daylight hours. Another course exists in Willoughby, Ohio on Marble Lane."

        "text": "The London Blitz are an American football team based in Finsbury Park, North London, England, who compete BAFA National Leagues Premier Division South, the highest level of British American football. They were formed in 1995 and operate from Finsbury Park Athletics Stadium. They are one of the Britain's most successful teams and are five-time BritBowl winners as well as European Champions following their EFAF Cup triumph in 2011. They have also seven divisional titles to their name.\nThe Blitz also operate a handful of Youth teams as well as fielding a second team in the BAFANL, the London Blitz B were formed in 2015 and are currently members of the SFC 2 South Division, the third level of the British League, Blitz B have made the play-offs on several occasions and have won one divisional title.\nHistory.\nThe Blitz field a senior team in the BAFA National Leagues Premiership as well as youth teams. The roster has included both local players as well as players from North America, Jamaica, South Africa, Uganda, and Nigeria. The team remained in the Premier division following the 2007 BAFL re-alignment.\nThe team was formed in 1995 after a merger between pre-existing sides: the Ealing Eagles (1984–1994) and the Woking Generals (1988–1993). The Blitz rose from the lower divisions of the then-British Senior League to the Premier Division. They won the British national championship, BritBowl XXI, in 2007, defeating Coventry Cassidy Jets 14–6. They returned to defend the title in 2008, missing out to a field goal with 4 seconds left to play losing 32–33 against Coventry Cassidy Jets in a repeat of the 2007 match. In 2009 and 2010 the Blitz cemented their place as the premier team in the UK by winning back to back BritBowls. In 2009 at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster they defeated the Coventry Jets 26–7 in BritBowl XXIII, then in 2010 at Sixways Stadium in Worcester facing the Coventry Jets for the fourth consecutive final they won 34–20 in BritBowl XXIV.\nThe team participated in their sixth consecutive BritBowl in September 2011. They defeated the London Warriors 18 – 0 at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. The 2011 double triumph of EFAF Cup and BritBowl was the most successful season for a British American Football team since the achievements of the London Olympians in the early nineties.\nIn 2010, the London Blitz had their first venture into European competition in the EFAF (European Federation of American Football) Cup (the second highest tier of European Club American Football), the Blitz defeated the Amsterdam Crusaders in the Netherlands and Les Cougars de Saint-Ouen L'Aumone (from the outskirts of Paris) at home in the group stage but then lost in the semi-final to the Carlstad Crusaders in Sweden.\nIn 2011, they again entered the EFAF Cup. They won their group matches comfortably, beating the Amsterdam Crusaders again, this time at home and then defeated the Valencia Firebats in Spain. The Blitz hosted the Danish Champions the Søllerød Gold Diggers in the semi-final beating them 23–7. The final was held at Finsbury Park on 2 July 2011. In front of a crowd of nearly 2,000 people the London Blitz won the EFAF Cup by beating the Serbian Champions, the Kragujevac Wild Boars 29–7.\n2012 saw the Blitz lose games in both Europe and in the domestic league for the first time in a few years. In Europe they took part in the EFL Eurobowl for the first time in the club's history. Group wins in Paris against the La Courneuve Flash and at home to L'Hospitalet Pioners from Spain led to a quarter final in Berlin against the Berlin Adler. The Blitz dominated most of the game and led late on but eventually lost 21–15. In the re-aligned domestic BAFANL Premiership South league they lost twice during the season to the London Warriors. The first time the Blitz had lost regular season games since 2008. However, they reached their 7th consecutive BritBowl at Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield where they faced the London Warriors again and this time the Blitz finished as winners when it mattered. The final score was 37–21 making the London Blitz national champions for the fourth consecutive year.\nFormer team captain Roderick Bradley appeared on television as Spartan in the 2008–2009 series of \"Gladiators\". Bradley joined the Blitz in 2005 after attending Loughborough University. After a long and successful career he has since retired from playing. Ex quarterback and Britbowl MVP Fred Boyle joined the Blitz in 2009 after leading the Hertfordshire Hurricanes for four years at the University of Hertfordshire. He too has since retired from playing after Blitz lost out to the Warriors in Britbwol XXVIII. The club chairman is Ed Morgan who joined the Blitz in 2006 after attending Leeds University. Bradley, Boyle and Morgan have represented Great Britain in the sport along with many other Blitz players.\nCurrent team captain and wide receiver Charlie Joseph has come up through the ranks from the Blitz Junior program and GB Juniors.\nBlitz B Team.\nIn 2015 London Blitz entered a development team 'London Blitz B' into the BAFA National League SFC2 East.

        "text": "Brian Davies (16 May 1930 – 14 November 2012) was a Queensland state and Australian national representative rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. He played in 27 Tests between 1951 and 1958 as captain on 3 occasions. He played at both Prop forward and as a Second rower and was a noted goal-kicker. His club career was played in both the Brisbane and Sydney domestic competitions. He is considered one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century.\nClub career.\nDavies was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and did not begin playing rugby league until he was eighteen. He was recruited purely on the basis of his size by Brisbane Brothers identity Bert Fraser to trial with Brothers in 1948. He became a regular first grader in 1950.

He returned to Queensland in 1963 as captain-coach of the St. George district side in 1963 and his final playing year in 1964 as captain-coach was back with the Brisbane Brothers club where his career had started.\nRepresentative career.\nBefore Davies begun playing rugby league, he played for Queensland's first ever representative water polo team. He played for Queensland at the 1948 Australian Championships, which was held at North Sydney Pool.\nDavies made his state representative debut for Queensland in the same year he debuted in club first grade and in that year 1950, also played for Queensland against a touring Great Britain side.\nHe made his Test debut against France in 1951 and played in all three Tests of that series at home. He was selected on the 1952 Kangaroo tour and played in all six Tests and eighteen minor tour matches. In 1953 he also made a three Test tour against New Zealand.

Davies was captain-coach of Australia in all three matches of the series which was lost 2 Tests to one. The Second Test in Brisbane is remembered for the heroic performance of Lion's captain Alan Prescott who played 76 minutes of the match with a broken-arm, refusing to come off with his side already down to twelve men having lost five-eighth Dave Bolton with a broken collar-bone. Against all odds the British side won 25–18.\nIn 1980 in the inaugural Rugby League State of Origin series along with fellow Queensland legend Duncan Hall, Davies was invited to be manager of the Queensland Maroons.\nAccolades.\nIn February 2008, Davies was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In June 2008, he was chosen in the Queensland Rugby League's Team of the Century at second-row.\nIn 2009 Davies was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame."

He was a who played first grade in the NSWRFL Premiership for Canterbury-Bankstown and Manly-Warringah from 1965 to 1972, winning the 1972 Grand Final with Manly. He also played for City Firsts, New South Wales and Australia in representative football.\nEarly life.\nDennis Ward was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nClub career.\nWard played for Canterbury-Bankstown for three seasons between 1964–1965 and 1967, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles for five seasons between 1968 and 1972, New South Wales in 1969 and 1973 and for the Australian national team in six test matches and four world cup matches between 1969 and 1972. He was named man-of-the-match in Manly-Warringah's 1972 grand final victory. Ward later became the Queensland Rugby League coaching director and the National Coaching Director for the New Zealand Rugby League.\nAfter retiring from the NSWRFL at the end of the 1972 season, Ward played 63 first grade games from 1973 to 1975 for Newcastle Rugby League side Western Suburbs Rosellas, and was the club's captain-coach from 1973 to 1974. In 1973 he was the first player selected directly from Wests for a Kangaroo Tour. He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 435. Dennis Ward was subsequently named at halfback in Wests Rosellas' team of the century.\nRepresentative career.\nWard first played representative football when he was chosen for the City Firsts side in 1969.

He next played for the Kangaroos in the 1972 Rugby League World Cup in France, including playing in the World Cup final against Great Britain in Lyon. During the WCF, Ward was involved in \"the greatest try never scored\", later shown on TV to be legitimately scored by Australian fullback Graeme Langlands who chased and dived to catch Ward's bomb in mid-air, but it was disallowed by French referee Georges Jameau who believed the Australian captain to be offside.\nWard was then chosen from Newcastle to the 1973 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, and although playing a number of games on the tour he did not play in a test match against either Great Britain or France.\nCoaching.\nIn 1977, Ward captain-coached the Wynnum-Manly club in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership, remaining on as coach for the 1978 season. Despite ostensibly retiring from playing after the 1977 season, Ward returned to the field in Round 10 of the 1978 BRL Season, scoring a try to lead Wynnum-Manly to a 24–13 upset win over the Easts Tigers. Ward also played as halfback in Wynnum-Manly's 35–4 loss to the Redcliffe Dolphins the following week. In the 1990s he became the Coaching and development director for the Queensland Rugby League."

He played all or parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily as a center fielder. He is the first person born in Honduras to play Major League Baseball.\nCareer.\nA 1982 graduate of Santa Ana Valley High School, Young was drafted in the 5th round of the 1982 MLB amateur draft by the New York Mets. He was, along with Rafael Palmeiro and Dwight Gooden, part of a draft class that set a major league record for a single team when 14 of those players reached the major leagues.\nTraded by the Mets to the Houston Astros on September 1, 1984, for third baseman Ray Knight, Young made his major league debut with them on July 8, 1987. This made him the first Honduran to play for the Astros, and the only one until Mauricio Dubon joined the team in 2022. He showed promise by hitting .321 and stealing 26 bases for the Astros, finishing 5th in National League Rookie of the Year voting despite playing less than half a season with the major league club. Young's best season in the major leagues came the following year, 1988, when he finished 2nd in the NL with 65 steals. 1989 was a disappointment for Young offensively, although he finished 8th in the league in steals (34) and accomplished a rare defensive feat by recording 412 putouts with only one error and adding 15 outfield assists.\nYoung spent the next three seasons splitting time between the Astros, their Triple A affiliate the Tucson Toros, and the disabled list (with an assortment of injuries). Although he was successful at the minor league level, always hitting over .300, his batting statistics for the Astros never replicated his earlier success. At the end of the 1992 season, Young became a free agent.\nYoung became an inaugural member of the expansion Colorado Rockies in 1993. Young hit .340 in spring training, but the team acquired power-hitting outfielder Dale Murphy in the first week of the 1993 season. Young was limited to one hit in 19 at bats over two months. The team released him when he declined to be sent to the minor leagues. He was a free agent for a few weeks before landing with the Class AAA affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds and hitting .301, but he was released after 32 games. He finished the season with the Class AAA affiliate of the Seattle Mariners, hitting .298 for them in 25 games.\nWith the St. Louis Cardinals in 1994, Young hit .333 in spring training, and he thought he might make the major league team, but he started the season with Class AAA Louisville after Cardinals manager Joe Torre decided to keep four outfielders on the roster instead of the customary five outfielders.\nYoung appeared in his final MLB game on August 11, 1994, playing for the Cardinals. He was released that October.\nPersonal life.\nGerald is married to Veronica; the couple have two children together.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Sporting News, Baseball Reference (Minor and Independent leagues), or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)"

The runner is in jeopardy once again, negating this safety, when: \nBy the rules, a runner is safe when he is entitled to the base he is trying for. Umpires will signal that a runner is safe by extending their elbows to their sides and then extending their arms fully to the side. For emphasis, an umpire may fully cross and extend his arms several times to indicate safe. Verbally, the umpire will usually simply say \"safe\". If a close play occurs that may have appeared to be a putout, the umpire will also call a reason for the safe call, such as \"he dropped the ball\" or \"he missed the tag\".\nCalling safe is a subjective decision which is better made using the sounds of the runner hitting the bag and the fielder catching the ball, rather than by sight."

        "text": "In baseball, a home run is credited to a batter when he hits a fair ball and reaches home safely on the same play, without the benefit of an error. 135 players have hit a home run in their first at bat of a Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date, the most recent being Jasson Dominguez of the New York Yankees on September 1, 2023. George Tebeau and Mike Griffin both hit home runs in their first at bats on April 16, 1887. Both players are recognized as the first player to homer in his first major league at bat because the exact time when each home run was hit is unclear.\nLuke Stuart, Walter Mueller, and Johnnie LeMaster hit inside-the-park home runs in their first at bats. Bill Duggleby, Jeremy Hermida, Brandon Crawford, Kevin Kouzmanoff and Daniel Nava hit grand slams in their first at bats—Kouzmanoff and Nava doing so on the first pitch. Ernie Koy and Heinie Mueller were the first players to accomplish the feat in the same game, doing so for the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies, respectively, in the first inning of Opening Day in 1938. This was equalled in 2016 by Tyler Austin and Aaron Judge, who became the only players to achieve the feat as teammates (playing for the New York Yankees) and in back-to-back at bats. Two players, Bob Nieman and Keith McDonald, each homered in their second at bat as well. Paul Gillespie and John Miller are the only players to hit home runs in both their first and last major league at bats; for Miller these were the only two home runs of his MLB career. For 23 players, their first at bat home run was the only home run of their major league careers. On the other hand, Gary Gaetti hit more home runs (360) than any other player to hit one in their first at bat.\nOf the 31 players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have hit a home run in their first major league at bat, two – Earl Averill and Hoyt Wilhelm – have been elected, neither of them on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave 19 players ineligible who are active and 75 players ineligible who did not play in 10 seasons.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "The Cricket in Times Square",
        "text": "The Cricket in Times Square is a 1960 children's book by George Selden and illustrated by Garth Williams. It won the Newbery Honor in 1961.\nSelden gave this explanation of what was the initial idea for the book:\nPlot.\nOn an early summer evening, Mario Bellini finds a cricket chirping near his parents' newsstand in the Times Square subway station. Papa Bellini allows Mario to keep the cricket in the newsstand as a pet despite Mama Bellini's fear that the cricket will attract more bugs.\nThe cricket's name is Chester. That evening, Chester meets Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat, best friends who live in an abandoned drainpipe near the newsstand. Chester tells them that he is from Connecticut and that he came to New York by being accidentally trapped in a picnic basket. Tucker and Harry show him Times Square, which he finds overwhelming.\nMr. Smedley, a music teacher who is a regular customer of the Bellinis, hears Chester chirping and likens the cricket to Orpheus. Mario takes Chester to Chinatown and buys a cricket cage from a shop owner named Sai Fong. While dreaming that night, Chester eats half of a two-dollar bill. The Bellinis decide that Chester must stay in his cage until Mario repays the two dollars. To free Chester, Tucker donates his life's savings, a collection of coins scrounged from the subway station. Mario realizes that he has been feeding Chester the wrong kind of food. He takes Chester to see Sai Fong,who from then on provides Chester a steady supply of mulberry leaves.\nTwo months after Chester's arrival in Times Square, he hosts a dinner party for Tucker and Harry in the newsstand. They turn on the radio, and to Tucker and Harry's delight, Chester begins imitating the songs. Tucker dances and accidentally knocks over a box of matches, setting the newsstand on fire. Mama Bellini blames the fire on Chester and demands that he go. Chester, saddened, chirps one of the songs he heard on the radio. The song is Mama Bellini's favorite, and she sings along. She relents and allows Chester to stay.\nThat night, Chester listens to the radio to learn more human music. The following morning, Chester chirps for Mr. Smedley, who is so impressed he writes a letter to the music editor of \"The New York Times\". The letter attracts crowds to the newsstand. Chester gives twice daily concerts, but by Thursday, he is exhausted and decides to retire. On Friday evening, he performs a farewell concert. For his final encore, he plays the sextet from \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", and the whole city pauses to listen.\nChester and Mario play together for the last time. Mario falls asleep. Chester takes the bell from his cricket cage. Tucker and Harry bring Chester to Grand Central Station. When Mario wakes, he realizes that Chester has left for home, and he feels glad. Tucker suggests to Harry that they visit Connecticut next summer.\nAdaptation.\nIn 1973, Chuck Jones wrote and directed a short animated version of \"The Cricket in Times Square\" with Mel Blanc cast as the voice of Tucker Mouse and Paul; Les Tremayne as the voices of Chester Cricket, Harry Cat, Papa Bellini, and Mr. Smedley; June Foray as Mama Bellini; and Kerry MacLane as Mario. The special aired on ABC on April 24, 1973.\nJones also wrote and directed two animated sequels, \"A Very Merry Cricket\" (1973) and \"Yankee Doodle Cricket\" (1975).\nSequels.\nSelden wrote six sequels to the book: \"Tucker's Countryside\" (1969), \"Harry Cat's Pet Puppy\" (1974), \"Chester Cricket's Pigeon Ride\" (1981), \"Chester Cricket's New Home\" (1983), \"Harry Kitten and Tucker Mouse\" (1986), and \"The Old Meadow\" (1987). Furthermore, in 2011 Macmillan released three \"Harry Cat and Tucker Mouse\" books by Thea Feldman based on characters in \"The Cricket in Times Square\": \"Harry to the Rescue!\", \"Starring Harry\", and \"Tucker's Beetle Band\"."

        "text": "The Immortals of rugby league in Australia are players named as the nation's greatest ever. From 1981 to 2017 \"The Immortals\" were named by the Australian sports magazine \"Rugby League Week\". From 2018, the National Rugby League took over \"The Immortals\" concept.\nEstablished in 1981, the original group consisted of former Test captains Clive Churchill, Bob Fulton, Reg Gasnier, and Johnny Raper. Although \"Rugby League Week\" (RLW) did not hold any official affiliation with any of the governing bodies of rugby league in Australia, the release was met with much public respect and admiration for the players listed. To coincide with this announcement, Hunter Valley vineyard Elliots Wines released, in conjunction with \"Rugby League Week\", four bottles of 1977 vintage port as a boxed set. Each player was represented on the label of each of the bottles. Returning eighteen years later, \"Rugby League Week\" announced in 1999 its intention to select a fifth member of The Immortals. However, the panel of experts chosen to pick the next Immortal was unable to decide on a sole player; it was then announced that the next additions to The Immortals would be Graeme Langlands and Wally Lewis. 2003 saw the addition of Arthur Beetson as the seventh Immortal.\nAndrew Johns was inducted as the eighth Immortal at the Men of League Gala Dinner the week of the 2012 NRL Grand Final. The judges who deliberated over candidates were: Wayne Bennett (seven-time premiership winning coach, former Queensland Origin coach), Ray Warren (Channel Nine network television senior commentator), John Grant (Chairman ARL Commission), David Middleton (leading rugby league historian), Ray Hadley (radio and Channel Nine network television commentator), Phil Rothfield (News Limited), Roy Masters (journalist, Fairfax Media), Geoff Prenter (RLW Founding Editor 1970-81), Ian Heads (RLW Editor 1981-87), Norman Tasker (RLW Editor 1988-2000), Tony Durkin (RLW Editor 2001-02), Martin Lenehan (RLW Editor 2003-11) and Mitchell Dale (RLW Editor). The current living Immortals (Fulton, Raper, Langlands, Lewis and Johns) were also granted a vote. Fulton, Raper and Langlands have since died.\nAlthough the tag of Immortal continues to be a highly respected one for any player to obtain, it was initially criticised for only being awarded to post-war players. However, it was agreed by the first judges in 1981 (Frank Hyde, Harry Bath and Tom Goodman), that they could only judge on players they had seen in action. Furthermore, to overcome entrenched criticism over Johns' admitted use of recreational drugs during his playing career, the rules were altered so the candidates can only be judged on their playing ability alone, and nothing else.\nWith the closure of \"Rugby League Week\" in 2017, the concept was taken over by the Australian Rugby League Commission.\nOn 1 August 2018, a further five players were announced as Immortals, bringing the tally to thirteen. They were Dave Brown, Frank Burge, Mal Meninga, Dally Messenger, and Norm Provan. It was the first time that the three pre-World War II champions could be considered for this recognition, as it had previously been an award restricted to post-World War II players.\nEligibility Criteria: To be eligible to be considered, the player must be a member of the National Rugby League Hall of Fame.\nLiving Immortals.\nThere are three living Immortals: Andrew Johns (age ), Wally Lewis () and Mal Meninga (). The last Immortal to die was Johnny Raper, on 9 February 2022."

Other riders included Gianni Motta and Marino Basso, who contributed 48 and 34 wins respectively. The Molteni family continues in cycling with sponsorship of Salmilano.\nThe sponsors Molteni were Italian salami manufacturers based in Arcore, near Milan.\nHistory.\nThe Molteni team began in 1958 with Renato Molteni as team manager. It was started by Pietro Molteni. The team was also managed by his son, Ambrogio Molteni, a former professional rider. The former Italian road champion, Giorgio Albani, finished his career with Molteni in 1959 and came back two years later as directeur sportif. The team had success with Gianni Motta in the 1966 Giro d'Italia and Michele Dancelli in the classics. Merckx joined at the end of 1970, having twice won the Tour de France and two editions of the Giro d'Italia. Molteni became predominantly Belgian and took many of Merckx's teammates from Faemino–Faema, including his directeur sportif, Guillaume Driessens. Albani replaced Driessens and directed the team with Robert Lelangue from 1972 to 1976. Other directeurs sportifs included Marino Fontana. After 1976 Molteni retired from the peloton."

        "title": "Manawatu Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Manawatu Rugby Football Union (MRU) serves as the governing body of the sport of rugby union in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand.\nFounded in 1886, Manawatu is one of New Zealand's oldest rugby unions. In 1892, the MRU, amongst other unions, played a pivotal role in establishing the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). During 1997–1998, Manawatu entered into an amalgamation with , as the \"Central Vikings\", wearing orange and blue attire.\nThe union is based in the city of Palmerston North though its catchment area includes players and clubs from nearby towns in the province, including Ashhurst, Feilding, Rongotea, Linton, Bulls, Pahiatua, Woodville and Dannevirke. It has over 5,000 players, making it the tenth largest union in New Zealand in terms of player numbers. In 2011, the union celebrated its 125th jubilee.\nManawatu have traditionally played in a distinctive green and white tramline jersey, which is thought to have been established in 1909. In 1996, a jersey including red was worn, and colours worn have varied since the union was formed.\nThe union's home ground is Central Energy Trust Arena.\nHistory.\nThe Manawatu rugby union was formed on 17 April 1886 at Palmerston North, with the founding clubs being: Palmerston, Feilding and Foxton. It was initially named the Manawatu County Union but was renamed in 1888. The sport had been introduced to the area by a few players from Wanganui, who had moved into the region. Following the unions establishment many other clubs were formed as the sport became more popular.\nEarly years\nThe first recorded match in the Manawatu took place on 13 July 1878. A Feilding side faced a \"Rangitikei Combined Clubs XV\" which was played at Feilding.\nThe first Ranfurly Shield game Manawatu appeared in was in 1914. This was played against Taranaki at Pukekura Park. The match was lost 11–3 with William Carroll scoring a sole try. Their next challenge came ten years later, in 1924, where they would lose 31–5 to Hawke's Bay. Manawatu also provided J.F. Manning to referee a match in 1905 between Auckland and Wellington.\n1970s and early 1980s: First division era and Ranfurly shield reign\nThe period from 1976 to 1983 saw Manawatu as one of the leading New Zealand rugby provinces. In this period Manawatu consistently beat teams such as Otago, Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury. Manawatu held the Ranfurly Shield from 1976 to 1978 and this was followed by victory in the 1980 First Division Championship. Manawatu were also runner-up in 1976 and 1981. A large sign reading \"Go! Go! Manawatu!\" was lifted above Palmerston North Showgrounds Oval by crane.\nManawatu beat Auckland 12–10 at Eden Park in 1976 to win the Log 'o Wood, as the Ranfurly Shield is sometimes referred to, for the first time. Doug Rollerson's dropped goal secured the famous victory for Manawatu. This led to a homecoming parade through the city streets.\nWith prop Kent Lambert sent-off, Manawatu were reduced to 14-men in their defense of the Ranfurly Shield against the Counties side in 1977. However, Manawatu rallied to record a victory 15–10. A last minute try prevented the Counties side from taking the Shield back to Pukekohe for the first time.\nThere was some controversy in 1977 when the Auckland rugby union had a request for a shield challenge that season denied by Manawatu who argued that Auckland had had 'too much influence in shield rugby for too long'.\nIn the final Ranfurly Shield challenge of the 1978 season Manawatu were leading North Auckland (now named Northland) 10–9 with time up on the clock. However, the referee, Bill Adlam, from Wanganui, played 5–6 minutes of 'injury' time before awarding the visitors a penalty, due to an offside, close to the posts. A penalty kick was successful and the shield was won by North Auckland. The referee then required a police escort off Showgrounds Oval (as it was known) while Manawatu fans showed their disgust and disappointment. Adlam claimed after the match that the game clock at the venue had not allocated for a couple of \"lengthy\" injury breaks, and so he rightly let the game go on. This was also backed up by a photographer who accurately timed the game.\nManawatu scored a 20–10 win over Australia in 1978.\nIn 1979 Auckland had won back the Ranfurly shield and denied Manawatu a challenge in 1980.\nIn 1980, during its championship winning season, Manawatu had eight All Blacks within the team. They were: Mark Donaldson, Mark Shaw, Geoff Old, Frank Oliver, Gary Knight, Doug Rollerson, Lachie Cameron and Craig Wickes.\nOne of Manawatu's most memorable matches was the 1981 encounter against South Africa. Manawatu led 9–4 at halftime and with minutes to go the score was 19–19. The clash between the national champions and the 'test' strength Springboks was headed for a climax worthy of such an event. In the final analysis, Naas Botha was the difference between the two sides. In the final minutes he scored a long range penalty, a dropped goal and a sideline conversion to lead the 'Boks home to a flattering 31–19 victory. The Manawatu verses Springbok game was the first to witness the Police riot squads patrolling the streets as a pre-emptive measure, as opposed to them just turning up once trouble started. The day was generally incident free.\nIn 1983 the Canterbury Ranfurly Shield team put Manawatu last on their list of challengers for that season.\nIn 1985, Manawatu celebrated a centenary for its club competition and in 1986, the union's centenary.\nLate 1980s to mid 2000s - second division\nIn 1988, the union was relegated to the second division for the first time. Manawatu, based in the second division, was reduced to a 'feeder' role, losing players to other unions.\nLee Stensness starred in a 58–24 win over Ireland in 1992.\nIn 1996 Manawatu and Hawke's Bay merged their teams to form the Central Vikings Rugby Union. It was an attempt to elevate both unions back to the first division. Players such as Mark Allen, Christian Cullen, Mark Ranby, Stephen Bachop and Roger Randle featured in the team. The 1997 season saw them finish second overall with 6 wins and 2 losses. This saw the team into the semi-finals. In the semi-final, the Vikings would go on to beat Bay of Plenty and came up against Northland in the final. Northland won the final 63–10. Northland were thus promoted to the first division. However, had the Vikings won, they would not have been eligible to be promoted.\n1998 saw a repeat of form for the Vikings who went unbeaten in the season. They subsequently won the final against Bay of Plenty and were promoted to first division. However, due to financial issues, the merger split back to Manawatu and Hawke's Bay as separate unions. Manawatu returned in 1999 to the second division.\nManawatu began the new millennium firmly fixed in the second-tier competition.\nIn 2005, Manawatu were heavily defeated 6–109 by the touring British and Irish Lions at Palmerston North.\n2006 onwards - return to the first division\nIn 2005, Manawatu were invited along with four other unions, reduced to three after an amalgamation of Nelson Bays and Marlborough into Tasman, to play in the first division of a restructured National Provincial Championship, initially called (for sponsorship purposes) the Air New Zealand Cup. It was the first time since 1988 Manawatu had fielded a team in the top grade and unlike the 1980s it was now a professional rugby competition.\nIn 2009, Central Energy Trust Arena was the venue for a Highlanders home game against the Bulls from South Africa.\nFly-half Aaron Cruden was selected for the All Blacks in 2010. He was the first All Black chosen whilst playing for the union since Christian Cullen in 1996.\nManawatu hosted two matches during the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nIn 2011, a resurgent Manawatu Turbos side defeated the Wellington Lions 31–25 in Wellington. It was Manawatu's first competition win over Wellington in the capital, after 124 years of trying. Also in 2011, Manawatu scored 54 points against Waikato team at Arena Manawatu. The Turbos led 35–17 at halftime, eventually winning 54–20. This kept the Turbos unbeaten at home for the season.\nIn 2012, Manawatu scored its first victory away to North Harbor. The win at home against Hawke's Bay made Manawatu one of the few Championship teams to beat a Premiership team.\nIn 2012, Aaron Smith was selected in the All Blacks after fine performances with Manawatu and the Highlanders. Smith joining Aaron Cruden meant for the first time since 1986, two All Blacks came from Manawatu.\nIn 2021 Manawatu appointed Andrea Jackson as Chief Executive Officer. Manawatu were the first top-flight union to appoint a woman in that role. \nClub Rugby.\nThe Manawatu rugby union includes the following clubs:\nManawatu representative players.\nManawatu All Blacks.\nIn New Zealand, to be selected to the All Blacks is the pinnacle of rugby achievement. In its history, Manawatu have produced many players who have been selected for the national team.\n♦ = indicates a club amalgamated with another\n♥ = indicates a club no longer in the Manawatu Rugby Union\n♣ = a club no longer extant\nManawatu players in Super Rugby.\nManawatu is in the Hurricanes catchment area, along with Wanganui, Hawke's Bay, Poverty Bay, East Coast, Horowhenua Kapiti, Wairarapa-Bush and Wellington. However players from Manawatu may be selected and signed by any of the Super Rugby franchises.\nManawatu players who have played for Super Rugby teams are:\nSupport.\nFans of Manawatu rugby are known throughout the rugby community in New Zealand for their habit of wearing plastic garden buckets cut to shape over their heads during matches. As such, fans of the provincial side have picked up the self-named nickname of \"Bucketheads\".\nTheme Songs.\nManawatu had two theme songs during their 'glory' years, which were played on radio '2ZA' in the days leading up to the big games on Saturday. They were:\nWomen's Rugby: Manawatu Cyclones.\nManawatu Cyclones is the women's representative team.

Manawatu drew with Hawke's Bay.\nIn 2012, the Women's Provincial Championship format was a full round robin of six teams playing six rounds (each team with one bye round). The Cyclones began with a bye. Wins for the Cyclones were over Waikato, Wellington and Hawke's Bay. Unfortunately large losses to Otago and eventual finalists Auckland and Canterbury and missing crucial bonus points, meant the Cyclones did not make the post-season.\nNotable Cyclones:\nCurrent\nPast\nNZ Rugby Museum.\nPalmerston North is the home of the New Zealand Rugby Museum and also the Sport &amp; Rugby Institute at the Turitea Campus, Massey University."

        "text": "Taranaki Rugby, previously the Taranaki Rugby Football Union, is the governing body for rugby union in Taranaki, New Zealand; Taranaki is a region of New Zealand that covers areas in the districts of New Plymouth and South Taranaki. Established in 1889, they represent the Mitre 10 Cup side, Taranaki Bulls, and Farah Palmer Cup side, Taranaki Whio. It is also affiliated with the Chiefs Super Rugby franchise. Their home playing colours are amber and black and they play their home games at TET Stadium &amp; Events Centre in Inglewood.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nTaranaki was officially established in 1889 after a team chosen from the surrounding clubs in existence played as Egmont in 1885. They began with a brown coloured jersey before adopting the amber and black hoops in 1892. During the amateur period, the team won the Ranfurly Shield on four occasions. It had also won seven-second division titles in the National Provincial Championship, more than any other team. Further notable moments were in 1959, when a record 35,000 spectators attended Rugby Park in New Plymouth to see the province play the British Lions. Two years later 36,000 people were on hand to watch France defeat the side 11-9.\nTheir first Ranfurly Shield victory came in 1913 when Auckland was defeated 14-11. Six successful defences followed before a 12-6 loss to Wellington in September 1914. In 1957 shield holders Wellington was defeated in a friendly match early in the year and a rematch was scheduled for later in the season. Otago defeated Wellington, and Otago accepted a special challenge by Taranaki. The match was played on 28 September 1957, the last Saturday of the season, after King Country gave up its scheduled fixture with Taranaki. Taranaki won against Otago for them to, later on, go a 13-match tenure.\nIn 1963 Taranaki regained the Ranfurly Shield once again off Wellington with a win at Athletic Park. Their third tenure would be its most successful one. The first challenge came from Wanganui who were making their second challenge of the season, having lost earlier to Auckland. Wanganui later would suffer a further defeat in 1964. Taranaki lost to Auckland in their last defence in 1965 and would not reclaim the shield again until 1996 when they edged Auckland 42-39. North Harbour lost narrowly in a tight contest before Taranaki was beaten by 20 points against Waikato.\nProfessional era.\nIn August 2011 Taranaki defeated Southland 15-12 in Invercargill to begin a fifth tenure of the shield. This ended in October 2012 when Waikato won the last challenge of the season. In 2013 Taranaki RFU assembled a women's professional team although it was later disbanded the following year. They claimed the national title for the first time in their history with a win over Tasman in the 2014 ITM Cup.\nReferees.\nTaranaki has a proud history of producing top level referees. Brian Duffy was the region's first test match referee and controlled six internationals, including one test between the British and Irish Lions and All Blacks in 1977. Paul Williams followed with his test debut coming in 2017. \nCam Stone and Will Johnston are in the National Panel and take charge of domestic competition matches. Richard Kelly featured in the panel for 12 years, including a successful sevens career, where he was the world's most capped sevens referee when he retired in March 2021. He controlled 280 matches over 52 tournaments, including the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018, 2018 World Rugby 7s World Cup and 2016 Rio Olympics, in which he refereed one semi-final. \nOther Taranaki referees have been involved in the national scene in the past, these are; Dee Luckin, Darryl Heibner, Chris Pollock, Brian MacDonald, Paul Macfie, Stuart Beissell, Ross Whitmore, Paul Honiss, Russell Hodge and Murray Dombroski.\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are 29 registered clubs incorporated and secondary schools affiliated with the Taranaki RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior levels. The Taranaki Rugby Referees' Association is also an affiliated member of the Taranaki RFU. The organisation provides match officials for senior club rugby down to junior grades. They also provide sideline support personnel to home National Provincial Championship, Super Rugby and test matches. \nPlayers.\nTaranaki Bulls.\nTaranaki RFU has several teams under its control, one of note is the Taranaki Bulls who compete in New Zealand's national rugby union competition the Mitre 10 Cup. Their top professional team, the Bulls is coached by Willie Rickards and co-captained by lock Mitchell Brown and midfielder Teihorangi Walden. Their traditional colors are amber and black hoops with white shorts, with Canterbury of New Zealand being the main manufacturer. They are also sponsored by proud Taranaki firm Yarrows the Bakers.\nTaranaki Whio.\nTaranaki Whio is the women's representative side that was reintroduced in 2018 to compete in the Farah Palmer Cup. The 2020 squad for the Farah Palmer Cup is coached by former Taranaki men's representative Brendan Haami. The squad consists of 29 players, they are; Leah Barnard, Gayle Broughton, Sharee Brown, Tiana Davison, Freedom Edmonds, Chelsea Fowler, Tachelle Gardiner, Natale Haupapa, Iritana Hohaia, Kaya-Rose Kahui, Donia King, Alicia Manuirirangi, Kelsyn McCook, Victoria McCullough, Hannah McLean, Danielle Muggeridge, Paige Neilson, Jaymi Ngaia, Kate Parkinson, Chloe Sampson, Brooke Sim, Lyn Smith, Jalana Smith, Kate Thomson, Catriona Tulloch, Aliene Wallis, Sharniqua Weston-Jacobson, Nicole Whittle, Sarah Winter.\nNotable players.\nTaranaki has produced 83 men's New Zealand internationals to date.

Though he made just 27 starts in his career, he pitched a no-hitter at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum against the Chicago White Sox on September 29, .\nWarren was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the twelfth round of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft out of Fullerton Union High School in Fullerton, California. After going 5-16 with a 5.60 earned run average over two seasons in which he never pitched at higher than the A-ball level, the Tigers released him. He was signed by Oakland shortly afterwards, but was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers rule 5 draft after just one season in their organization. He and fellow minor leaguer John Evans were traded back to the A's for infielder Rob Picciolo at the start of the minor league season.\nWarren rewarded the A's with a breakout season for the Modesto A's in 1982, going 19-4 with a 3.00 ERA and 154 strikeouts to lead his team to the California League Championship. He made the jump from double A to the majors in 1983 thanks in part to a rash of injuries suffered by Oakland pitching. He was ineffective in two relief appearances, and was optioned to triple A Tacoma. He went 6-3 with a 3.53 ERA for the Tacoma Tigers to earn a call back to Oakland that August, this time as a starting pitcher. He was 1-3 with a 6.54 ERA when he won his final four starts of the season with a 1.85 ERA. The no-hitter came in his final start of the season, and was the thirteenth no-hitter in major league history by a rookie.\nWarren suffered from a lack of run support as the A's managed to score just two runs in his first two starts of the season. When Oakland's bats finally heated up, Warren began suffering control issues. He was moved into the bullpen, and eventually optioned back to Tacoma in June with a 3-6 record and 5.09 ERA. He returned to the team briefly in July and again when rosters expanded that September.\nHis record stood at 1-4 with a 7.92 ERA in when he was relegated to \"mop up duty\" by manager Jackie Moore.

It was available for download from the official website for PC users, and the Xbox Live Marketplace for Xbox 360 users.\nReception.\nInitial reviews of \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2007\" were mixed. The game was viewed as a solid replacement for \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2005\" with improvements in most areas. There was criticism, where reviewers complained of a lack of improvement in the graphics despite being a next generation game, and the gameplay being too easy. Other reviews commented on how the game might not appeal to non cricket fans. Also criticised is the lack of statistical tracking that occurs during television coverage of cricket despite claims it emulates the coverage well. The game has been praised for its relatively realistic simulation of real cricket."

        "title": "Chris Carr (American football)",
        "text": "Charles Christopher Carr (born April 30, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback, punt returner, and kick returner in the National Football League (NFL). He was signed by the Oakland Raiders as an undrafted free agent in 2005. He also played for the Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens, Minnesota Vikings, San Diego Chargers and New Orleans Saints. He played college football for the Boise State Broncos.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Reno, Nevada, he played both football and basketball at Robert McQueen High School in Reno. He also played for the Reno Steelers Pop Warner team. He played defensive back and was an All-State running back as a sophomore, junior and senior. He was also named Northern Nevada Player of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year his senior year, where he rushed for 1,944 yards on 206 carries and 34 touchdowns.\nCollege career.\nHe played his college ball at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho, lettered all four years, played in all 12 games as a true freshman in 2001 and posted 32 tackles. Carr was the Pat Fuller Memorial Award winner for Academic Achievement. As a senior, in 2004, he finished the season as the NCAA active career leader in average yardage per punt return, with 19.8 (22 punt returns for 432 yards). Even though he missed the last six games of regular season, as a senior, he was named honorable mention All-WAC as a safety and kick returner.\nProfessional career.\nOakland Raiders.\nHe was signed by the Oakland Raiders in 2005 as an undrafted free agent. Carr's main contribution to the Raiders was as a kickoff and punt returner on special teams. He played in all 16 games in the 2005 NFL season for the Raiders, and had seven tackles, two assists and two pass deflections. As a kick returner, he ran 73 times for 1752 yards (an average of 24 per carry) with a long of 62 yards. As a punt returner, he ran 32 times for 186 yards (an average of 5.5) with a long of 34. He only gave up 2 fumbles.\nHis first touchdown came while playing as a cornerback, when he intercepted a pass by Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and returned it 100 yards for a touchdown on October 29, 2006 at McAfee Coliseum. It was the second longest interception for a touchdown in Raiders history (6th longest in NFL history) and helped seal an upset win over the defending Super Bowl champions.\nCarr is the Raiders all-time leader in kickoff return yardage, with a total of 4,841 yards on 201 attempts.\nTennessee Titans.\nCarr became a restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason. On March 29, the Titans signed Carr to a one-year, $2 million offer sheet. On April 5, the Raiders declined to match the offer after seven days and Carr became a member of the Titans. Carr had 31 tackles and an interception with the Titans in 2008. He also had his best year as a return man as a member of the Tennessee Titans Averaging 28.1 yards per kick return and 10.1 yards per punt return. The Titans finished the season with the best return average in the NFL.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nCarr signed a two-year, $5 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens on March 18, 2009. In the 2009 season, Carr started off as primarily a returner, but injuries to Fabian Washington and Lardarius Webb made him a more prominent part of the defense. He finished the year strongly in his new role, recording career highs with 44 tackles and 2 interceptions. The year was capped off with an interception of Tom Brady in the playoffs when facing the New England Patriots.\nAt the start of training camp the following year, Dominique Foxworth suffered a tear to his ACL. With Washington and Webb still recovering from ACL tears of their own, Carr was upgraded to a starter in drills and the preseason alongside former Seattle Seahawk Josh Wilson. He began the season as a starter opposite the returning Washington. Carr was used much less as a returner and much more on defense, having his best defensive year of his career. In 2010, Carr set a career-high in tackles (61) and tied a previous career high set in 2009 with two interceptions.\nOn July 30, 2011, the Baltimore Ravens re-signed Carr (four-year deal) as an unrestricted free agent, retaining experience in an otherwise very young cornerback group that included 2011 first-round pick Jimmy Smith. Carr, however, missed much of 2011 with injuries, and became expendable. He recorded only 19 tackles that year (plus a sack). Carr had previously never missed a game in his career.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nCarr signed with the Minnesota Vikings on April 4, 2012. On August 31, 2012 as the Vikings reduced their roster to league maximum of 53 players, he was released.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nAfter spending the first four weeks of the 2012 season out of football, Carr joined his fifth career team by signing a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers had sustained multiple injuries to their secondary.\nWhile with the team, he recorded four tackles, returned five kickoffs, and two punts. He played in nine games.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn June 11, 2013, Carr signed a one-year deal with the New Orleans Saints. He was cut on August 31, 2013. After cornerback Patrick Robinson was injured in the Saints' second game, Carr was re-signed on September 17, 2013. On December 17, 2013, Carr was released.\nNFL career statistics.\nRetirement.\nOn March 19, 2014, Carr announced his intention to retire.\nIn May 2017, Carr graduated from the George Washington University Law School. He is currently an attorney at Zeman and Petterson, PLLC."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured Australia during the 1990–91 cricket season to compete in a five-match Test series against Australia for the Ashes. While in Australia, England also played a number of tour matches against state and representative teams, and competed in the one-day international (ODI) World Series Cup against Australia and New Zealand. At the conclusion of the tour, England flew to New Zealand to participate in a three-game ODI series.\nUnder the captaincy of Graham Gooch, England were unable to regain the Ashes, losing the series 3–0.\nTouring squad.\nThe England squad flew out to Australia on 18 October 1990. The personnel was vastly different due to the turbulent years that had followed the previous tour to Australia, which had been won 2–1 under Mike Gatting, who had chosen to captain an England XI on a rebel tour of South Africa and subsequently had been banned from Test cricket for three years. Following the humiliation of the 1989 Ashes series defeat, Graham Gooch replaced David Gower as captain and although England continued their streak of series defeats against West Indies (going down 2–1 after winning the First Test), they won back much respect, and then followed up with series wins against India and New Zealand during the home summer. \nAs a result, although the initial squad contained a number of inexperienced Test players (only five squad members – Gooch, Gower, Allan Lamb, Gladstone Small and Eddie Hemmings – had been on earlier tours of Australia), journalists such as former Test cricketer Mike Selvey (writing for \"The Guardian\" at the time) felt somewhat confident that England could match it with the Australians. \nPhillip DeFreitas (Lancashire) Hugh Morris (Glamorgan) and Phil Newport (Worcestershire) received subsequent call-ups to cover or replace injured players.\nAs on the previous Australian series, the tour was managed by Peter Lush, while Micky Stewart was team manager.\nTour matches.\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember \nJanuary\nWorld Series Cup.\nEngland also played in the World Series Cup triangular tournament with Australia and New Zealand.

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1993",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured England in 1993 aiming to retain The Ashes for a second consecutive occasion, having successfully defended them on home turf in the 1990/91 season.\nSix Test matches were scheduled, of which Australia won four and England one, with one match drawn. Australia won the Texaco Trophy series that preceded the Tests 3–0.\nThe gulf in quality between the sides was vast, and was emphasised by the fact that nine of Australia's team played all six tests, while England used 24 players in the series, including seven debutants. One of the surprises among the inconsistent selection was the regular selection of Alec Stewart as wicketkeeper and middle-order batsman, rather than a specialist wicketkeeper that would allow Stewart to open the batting.\nComing off a series defeat in India, England were low in confidence, and even their star performer in India and Sri Lanka, Graeme Hick, was still considered to be fighting for his place, judging by comments to the media by coach Keith Fletcher. Graham Gooch resigned the captaincy after the Fourth Test, once the series was decided, and Mike Atherton led the side in the final two tests, winning the Sixth, at The Oval.\nTest series.\nFirst Test (3–7 June).\nFour players debuted in the First Test: Andy Caddick and Peter Such for England and Brendon Julian and Michael Slater for the tourists. The new Australian opening partnership of Slater and Mark Taylor dominated the first part of the first day, putting on 128 for the first wicket, but it was Such who shared the spoils with his fellow debutant, taking six wickets in the innings, including that of Taylor who had made a superb 124, his third century against England.\nThe England reply is remembered primarily for Shane Warne's first delivery of the series, a drifting delivery to Mike Gatting that pitched outside leg stump, then turned sharply, beating Gatting's bat and clipping the top of off stump. Aside from that particular moment, the only real highlight was Gooch's 65, before he too fell victim to Warne.\nAustralia looked in trouble in their second innings at 46/2, with Such again proving the worth of his selection, but David Boon (93) and Mark Waugh (64) added a century to steady the visitors' nerves, before Steve Waugh (78*) and Ian Healy (with his maiden Test century - 102*) took the attack to the bowling and helped Border set a huge target by declaring on 432/5.\nEngland's theoretical run chase got off to a good start - Gooch put on 73 with Mike Atherton and a further 60 with Gatting and 52 with Graeme Hick. Gooch was then dismissed in unusual fashion for handling the ball, after which the collapse set in. Only Chris Lewis (43) made any other significant contribution to the innings, as Warne (4-86) and Merv Hughes (4-92) rattled through the hosts' tail.\nSecond Test (17–21 June).\nFor England Neil Foster returned to the side in place of the injured DeFreitas, while the Australians played Tim May as a second spinner at the expense of Julian. Australia won the toss and made the most of excellent batting conditions. Taylor and Slater demolished the England bowling as they added 260 for the first wicket, and batted almost the entire day. Both fell in the hour prior to the close after compiling superb centuries. Taylor's second of the series (111) was made off 243 balls and comprised ten fours and a six, while Slater's 152 rattled along a bit faster, and included 18 boundaries. Boon and Mark Waugh took up the gauntlet on the second day and added another 175 to rub it in, with Waugh falling to Phil Tufnell just one shy of his century. Boon went on to enjoy another century partnership with Allan Border (77), before the captain finally declared the innings on the third morning, Boon ending up not out on 164.\nEngland's reply was built around a solid 80 from Atherton, but his was the only significant resistance as Hughes (4-52), Warne (4-57) and May (2-64) ripped through the other batsmen with relative ease, Australia not even hampered by Craig McDermott's not being available to bowl. Robin Smith and Hick got starts but couldn't capitalise, and England were bowled out early on the fourth morning. Following on, England put up a stronger fight: Atherton and Gooch added 71 for the first wicket and Atherton and Gatting another century, before the former was cruelly run out on 99 as he slipped turning back to regain his ground after turning down a third run.\nGatting, Hick and Stewart all contributed half-centuries to the cause, but with a first innings deficit of over 400 they had needed to turn them into big centuries if England were to save the game, and the Australian bowlers kept plugging away, with May and Warne picking up four wickets apiece in a combined marathon of just one ball short of a hundred overs. Border picked up the other wicket with his occasional spin, and really stifled the batsmen - his 16 overs cost just 16 runs.\nThe last four wickets fell quickly on the final day, when it appeared as though England might hold out for a draw against all odds. From 361/6, Stewart's dismissal heralded the final collapse, and Foster, Such and Tufnell surrendered meekly, leaving England all out on 365.\nThird Test (1–6 July).\nEngland rang the changes for the Third Test, with Graham Thorpe, Mark Lathwell, Martin McCague, and Mark Ilott coming in for their Test debuts, while Nasser Hussain also returned to the side, in place of Tufnell, Gatting, Lewis, Hick and Foster.\nThe home side won the toss and batted first, but failed to make the most of the opportunity to use what appeared to be a pretty flat pitch. Lathwell and Atherton struggled early on, and it was only when Robin Smith came to the crease that England started to look as though they might post a competitive score. His fluent 86, and a half-century from Hussain kept hopes alive, though at 276/6 at the end of the first day, coach Keith Fletcher was unhappy with the way the batsmen had got themselves out, criticising three \"soft\" dismissals in the top six. Hughes (5-92) and Warne (3-74) bowled well again, and wrapped up the innings early on day two.\nStumbling a little at 74/2, Australia's reply was boosted by a partnership of 123 between Boon and Mark Waugh, and the rate of scoring on the second afternoon was excellent, with 250 runs being added after lunch. England took five wickets in the day, McCague bowling with pace and menace, but Border (who dropped down the order to allow Julian to act as nightwatchman) and Warne added important runs on the third morning to give the visitors a first innings lead of 52.\nEngland lost Atherton early, caught behind off Hughes, but Lathwell and Smith added 89 to erase the deficit. A collapse looked likely when Warne switched from the Radcliffe Road End, where he had looked fairly tame, to the Pavilion End where he immediately found turn and bounce and had both established batsmen out in quick succession, Smith caught behind and Lathwell adjudged lbw. Stewart followed shortly after, leaving England 117/4 and in real danger of throwing the match away. Caddick came in as nightwatchman and shepherded Gooch to the close, which proved a vital stage of the innings. Gooch came out the next morning in bullish mood and took the attack to the tourists, bludgeoning 120 and adding 150 with Graham Thorpe (114*), who went on to complete his maiden Test century on the fifth morning, adding a further 113 with Hussain before Gooch called for the declaration.\nWith 76 overs remaining in the match, and a target of 371 more-or-less out of the question, England were able to attack, and when Caddick ripped out Boon, Mark Waugh and Border to add to Such's dismissals of the openers, it looked as though an upset was on the cards, with Australia reeling on 115/6 at tea, but Steve Waugh (47* in three hours) and Brendan Julian (56* in just over two hours) provided stout resistance in the final session, and steered Australia to the safety of a draw.\nFourth Test (22–26 July).\nFor England, on the back of their improved performance at Trent Bridge, the only change was tactical: Martin Bicknell came in to make his debut as a fourth seamer at the expense of the unlucky Such, England's leading wicket taker in the series. Australia also made one change, again dropping Julian, this time in favour of Paul Reiffel, and retained two front-line spinners (May and Warne).\nAustralia won the toss and continued their habit of racking up the first innings runs. Slater and Taylor added 86, and Boon and Mark Waugh, and then Boon and Border each compiled century stands. With the fall of Boon, the onslaught really started though: Border and Steve Waugh latched onto anything loose from the tired England bowlers, especially square of the wicket on both sides, and scored 45 boundaries between them in an unbroken stand of 332, which only ended when the captain reached his double century and declared, leaving Waugh unbeaten on 157. Ilott and Bicknell, the only bowlers to take wickets, bowled fifty overs each, and England sorely missed a spinner to bowl some of those overs and provide some variation. Even Graham Thorpe's unthreatening dibbly-dobblies were called upon to rest the main seamers.\nEngland's reply got off to a disastrous start, with Lathwell caught behind off Hughes in the first over, and Smith and Stewart following soon after, leaving the hosts reeling on 50/3. Atherton (55) and Gooch (59) worked hard to restore some pride to the scoreboard with a century partnership, before Atherton's dismissal by Reiffel saw the collapse begin. From 158/3, none of the middle and lower order managed to stick around, and Hughes (3-47) and Reiffel (5-65) cleaned up.\nThe second innings began a little better: following-on for the second time in the series, the top order worked harder, and built some reasonable partnerships. Atherton made 63 before succumbing to the wiles of May and dragging himself too far from safety, offering a stumping chance of the type that Healy rarely missed. Stewart top-scored with 78, and all the specialist batsmen made starts. None, however, could convert that into the really big score that England needed from them to have a chance of saving the match. Hussain was left stranded with the tail, but neither he nor the bowlers could make any impression, and they got seriously bogged down. Hussain's 18 not out took nearly two hours to compile, and the 16 that he and Caddick added together for the seventh wicket almost an hour.\nIn the end Hughes (3-79) and May (4-65) polished off the tail to add to Reiffel's earlier good work, and Warne was luckless in forty tidy overs that cost just 63 runs.\nFifth Test (5–9 August).\nGraham Gooch resigned the England captaincy after the Fourth Test, with the series decisively lost; new skipper Atherton won the toss and elected to bat. Having played no spinners in the previous Test and being found out, England picked two this time: Such and John Emburey, who replaced seamers McCague and Caddick. Lathwell was also dropped and Matthew Maynard came into the middle order, with Gooch resuming his place as an opener despite his success lower down. This seemed a particularly ill-judged decision when the Essex man lasted only 20 balls before edging Reiffel to slip. Maynard made a duck on his return to the side, leaving England at 76/3, but Atherton and Stewart consolidated, doubling the score before Stewart mistimed a stroke and dollied up a return catch to bowler Warne. Bicknell and Thorpe both provided Emburey (55*) with partners to resist the attack, but Reiffel wrapped up the tail once they had gone, finishing with six well-earned wickets.\nAt 80/4, Australia's reply was looking rather shaky, and England thought they had a fifth wicket but the appeal for a catch by Hussain at slip with Mark Waugh on 0 was turned down by David Shepherd. This proved to be a turning point, as Waugh stroked an elegant century, as with brother Steve (59) he added 153, and added a further century with 'keeper Ian Healy (80 from 107 balls) for the seventh wicket. Such was once again the pick of the England bowlers, achieving control (52 overs for just 90 runs) as well as three wickets.\nEngland's second innings started well, with Gooch (48) providing the glue, but a flurry of wickets saw England slip from 104/1 to 125/6 in quick order on the fourth afternoon. Thorpe (60) and Emburey (37) added a century stand that gave the score some respectability, but by that time the hosts were in no position to save the match, and were dismissed shortly before the end of the day, leaving Australia a target of 120. Doubts set in at the start of the visitors' run chase when both Taylor and Slater were caught by Thorpe with the score on 12, but Mark Waugh (62*) and Boon (38*) saw them safely to their target with few further alarms.\nSixth Test (19–23 August).\nAgain England made multiple changes to the side from the previous Test. This time, Smith, Emburey, Bicknell and Illot felt the chop from the selectors' axe, while Graham Thorpe had to be left out after a delivery from a 17-year-old net bowler broke his thumb, leading to coach Fletcher reporting the nets at The Oval as sub-standard. In their places came the pace trio of Devon Malcolm, Angus Fraser and Steve Watkin, all making their first appearances of the series, and batsmen Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash. Australia were unchanged again, as expected.\nEngland won the toss and batted, and initially made the most of an excellent batting surface. Gooch, Atherton and Hick (80) all made good starts and got half-centuries, but were unable to capitalise and make a really big score, and late in the day Stewart (76) and Fraser enjoyed a good partnership of 62. England's score was 353/7 at the end of the first day. The most disappointing aspect of England's batting was that all seven specialist batsmen were out by now and, although there were runs on the board, most commentators felt a first innings score of around 500 would be necessary to put any pressure on the Australians. As it was, Reiffel (2-88) and Hughes (3-121) knocked the tail over the next morning and Australia were batting and looking to make inroads into the total. They were halted in their tracks by a destructive spell of fast bowling from Malcolm though, who took the first two wickets and, with Fraser, left the visitors struggling at 53/3. Taylor and Border, and then later Healy with a pugnacious 83, added some respectability to the total, but 303 was well below the score that the Australians expected. Fraser picked up his fifth Test five-for, while Malcolm bowled with great pace and less of his usual waywardness, and Watkin and Such supported well.\nWith a lead of 77, England pressed on in the second innings, Gooch (79), Atherton (42) and Hick (36) making starts before the wobbles set in. From 180/2, the hosts suddenly found themselves 186/5, and only a solid three-hour 64 from Ramprakash with initial support from Stewart steered the total above 300. After claiming overnight that they would not be batting for the draw, Australia's main worry soon became avoiding defeat once they slipped to 30/3: Watkin (4-65) ripped out the top order. Border and the Waughs added a little steel, but an inspired Malcolm came on after lunch and had Border caught behind and Mark Waugh (49) caught by Ramprakash, before trapping Steve Waugh in front, leaving Australia 106/6. Reiffel (42) and Warne (37) mustered some late-innings hitting, but it was all in vain, and England finally pulled off a victory in this series when Fraser had Warne adjudged lbw. This Test match holds the record for the highest aggregate (1225) without a century partnership - there were 12 half-century partnerships.\nExternal sources.\nCricketArchive"

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1994–95",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured Australia in 1994–95 to compete in the Ashes series against their hosts. The series consisted of five Test matches, Australia winning three, England one, and the other match was drawn. Australia retained the Ashes a third consecutive time.\nOverview.\nThe experienced Mike Gatting was added to the England squads that had toured the West Indies and enjoyed success in home series against New Zealand and South Africa. Joey Benjamin and Martin McCague were recalled to the bowling after successful county seasons, although the omission of Angus Fraser surprised some, and when McCague was later incapacitated by injury and Fraser sent out as a replacement, he was preferred to Benjamin in the test side, as also was a later replacement Chris Lewis. Mike Atherton again captained the team, rallying after the summer indiscretions at Lord's though it appeared he was less than happy at the selections that had been made.\nThe tourists' problems began almost immediately on arriving in Australia, as opening batsman Alec Stewart fractured a finger in a practice match and Shaun Udal broke his thumb in the official tour opener at Lilac Hill. This was followed by Devon Malcolm and Benjamin succumbing to chickenpox prior to the First Test. Malcolm's absence was a huge blow to England, whose coach Keith Fletcher had built up as a focal point of the pace attack, comparing the England seamers to the legendary Lillee and Thomson and claiming that the Australians were scared of his pace, while describing Darren Gough as \"Yorkshire's fastest since Freddie Trueman\". Lillie and former Aussie skipper Greg Chappell poured scorn on such claims. Meanwhile, both David Hopps of \"The Guardian\" and Simon O'Hagan in \"The Independent\" identified Graham Thorpe as England's key batsman, and the most likely to counter the leg-spin of Shane Warne.\nAs England arrived for the series, the Australian side were still in the midst of their tour of Pakistan, their first under new captain Mark Taylor, where they lost a close series 1–0 with batsmen taking most of the plaudits. Michael Bevan, Michael Slater, Mark Waugh and Steve Waugh had provided most of the Australian runs, while Warne was the principal bowling threat, picking up 18 wickets in the series. Injuries to Steve Waugh and wicketkeeper Ian Healy stymied their approach somewhat, but they were unlucky to lose the series which effectively turned in Pakistan's favour with a last wicket partnership of 57 between Inzamam ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed that sealed victory for the hosts in the First Test, The Australians identified Warne as the prime challenge for the visitors, with Australia's seamers on the decline.\nEngland were also involved in a One Day International tournament with Zimbabwe, Australia and an Australia 'A' side, which was won by Australia.\nTest Series.\nFirst Test.\nThe build-up to the First Test was chaotic from the England perspective. The first choice bowling attack was compromised when Devon Malcolm was struck down by chickenpox, which team manager Mike Smith described as \"a major loss to the side\". Malcolm was replaced by left arm spinner Phil Tufnell, while Angus Fraser was called up to the tour as cover from his club cricket in Sydney. Mike Gatting was preferred over John Crawley for the final batting spot, despite his indifferent form in the early part of the tour and questions over whether he was actually part of captain Mike Atherton's plans. Indeed, the skipper and tour managers had already come under some criticism from Chairman of Selectors Ray Illingworth back in London, which did not help team morale.\nBy contrast, the hosts were able to pick from a full strength squad, with Ian Healy recovered from his broken finger. Curator Keith Mitchell promised that the pitch would be conducive to spin, and Australia included both Shane Warne and Tim May to take advantage of the conditions at the expense of seamer Damien Fleming. Coach Bobby Simpson described the pitch as \"a great batting strip\", and Atherton called it \"a belter\".\nOn the first morning, openers Michael Slater and captain Mark Taylor made the most of winning the toss, advancing to 87/0 at lunch untroubled by the England bowlers, with Taylor making a fluent half-century. A mix-up saw both batsmen at one end soon after lunch, and Taylor departed run out for 59. David Boon followed soon after, when he played on to Darren Gough, but this only brought Mark Waugh to the crease, and he and Slater saw through most of the rest of the day at a run a ball, Slater moving to a century (173 balls). His 150 came in just another 51 deliveries, before eventually being dismissed by the part-time seam of Graham Gooch, lifting him to Gatting at mid-off for 176 (25 fours). Michael Bevan was Gough's third wicket of the day shortly before the close, but Waugh and nightwatchman Warne saw the home side safely through to 329/4 at the end of the day.\nOn the second morning, Waugh proceeded to his century (his third against England) off 166 deliveries, and he was the ninth man out for 140 caught by Alec Stewart at short cover off Gough. In their reply, England struggled against the imposing Craig McDermott, who was motivated by press speculation about his form, insisting that \"it was a shock to me...I don't know where it's come from or what it's about, but I have to silence it.\" He picked up the early wickets of Stewart and Graeme Hick and returning later in the day to trap Gatting in front. At the other end, Atherton batted well before he became a fifth victim of McDermott (6–53), edging an attempted hook to Healy for 54 early on the third morning, and the tourists subsided to a total of 167.\nTaylor opted not to enforce the follow-on, and he and Slater put on 109 in even time before Gough made the breakthrough, followed by two strikes from Tufnell, removing Boon, as the England bowlers fought back. Phillip DeFreitas also chipped in with a couple of wickets, but Healy (45 not out) helped the Australians set a target of 508 for England to chase. Warne struck either side of lunch to dismiss Stewart and Atherton, but Hick (80) and Graham Thorpe (67) gave the England fans some hope, adding 152 in four hours together before the close, playing Warne and May with relative ease.\nHalf an hour into the final day, Warne finally turned the tide back in favour of the Australians and effectively sealed the victory. Thorpe pushed forward to a fuller delivery and missed it, then Hick was caught off the back of his bat after the ball ricocheted off his arm. Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling. Warne cleaned up the tail to finish with match figures of 11–108 and pick up the man-of-the-match award, and the game was over before tea on the final day, England mustering 323.\nAt the post-match press conference, losing captain Atherton said that \"It's a devastating defeat for me. I stressed before the Test the importance of not losing the first game... It can set the tone for the series\", but emphasised his team's stomach for a fight, noting their recovery in the West Indies, saying: \"...we came back towards the end of the tour and won in Bridgetown. I hope we come back quicker this time.\"\nSecond Test.\nBetween the first two Tests, England lost two of their three World Series Cup matches, and two fifty over matches against the Australian Cricket Academy, but won a four-day match against Queensland with Gatting scoring a double-hundred to secure his Test place. The break also saw Dennis Lillee commenting critically about the state of the pitches, concerned that they were deliberately being produced to favour spin.\nAustralia made one change to their Brisbane line-up, bringing Fleming in for Glenn McGrath, while England's only change saw the recovered Devon Malcolm replacing Martin McCague. Atherton won the toss and elected to field, but despite picking up the wickets of Slater (run out) and Taylor, the England bowlers generally bowled far too short and wide, and did not make best use of the damp conditions. Boon and Mark Waugh added 52 before Tufnell struck, and Bevan followed soon after, popping a Gough delivery up to the skipper at gully to leave the hosts 100/4. The Waughs added another 71, but Mark (71) was picked up by DeFreitas, and Healy and Warne were dismissed quickly by Tufnell and Gough (4–60) respectively to leave the Australians 220/7 by the close.\nSteve Waugh (94 not out) continued his good work the next morning, adding another 59 with the tail, but were a little disappointed not to post a bigger total. The England innings got off to an inauspicious start with Stewart forced to retired hurt after he received a blow to the hand from McDermott. Atherton (44) was again the early linchpin, adding 30 with Hick and another 79 with Thorpe (51), before the former was given out caught behind decision by Steve Randell, Atherton was adjudged leg before to Warne, and Thorpe was given out caught at silly point off the same bowler. England collapsed from 119/1 to 151/6 in short order, and then from 185/6 to 212 all out, with McDermott (3–72) and Warne (6–64) the main wicket-takers.\nThe second innings saw a solid start from the Australian openers, followed up by Mark Waugh, but the main thrust of the innings came from Boon, who added 112 with Bevan on the third morning in his total of 131 that spanned over six hours. Once these two were parted, the run rate dropped, and Taylor declared the innings on 320/7, leaving England 388 to win in four sessions of play. McDermott picked up his 250th Test wicket when Thorpe became the third England wicket to fall in the first of those sessions, having already seen Fleming dispose of Gooch and Hick, and Atherton also fell before the close on the fourth day.\nThe final day saw little resistance from England. McDermott had Gatting and Rhodes both caught in the slips before Warne, utilised from the start of the day, became the third Australian to take an Ashes hat-trick, removing DeFreitas (lbw), Gough (caught behind) and Malcolm (caught at short leg). McDermott completed had Tufnell edged to give Healy his fifth catch of the innings, leaving the tourists all out for 92 in less than two sessions.\nWarne played down his achievement, commenting that \"I was just trying to tie up an end and I got a bit lucky\", while his skipper noted that \"Shane is like the West Indian bowlers – when he gets on top he gets all over you\". Atherton was unhappy at the post-match press conference. \"I don't like to see us lie down and die,\" he said, referring to his decision to have Alec Stewart bat in the second innings despite a broken finger, but he admitted that \"we got walloped in the first two Tests... We've got some good players [but] we're not playing especially well at the moment.\" The Sydney Morning Herald was less charitable towards England's performances to date, with Patrick Smith claiming that \"\"Wisden\" should count England wickets as just a half\", and deploring Atherton's lack of aggression in the field. He also derided Gooch, Gatting and Hick, and picked out the way that the visitors' batsmen got themselves out so readily.\nThird Test.\nAfter his performance in the first two tests, Shane Warne's future was the subject of considerable speculation in the media. A Reuters report suggested that he was troubled by chronic shoulder troubles, but that if he could overcome them he would be the mainstay of Australia's bowling attack for a long time. The England skipper added to the Australian eulogies, describing Warne as \"easily the best bowler on either side\", though Pakistan's Saleem Malik was less effusive, noting that \"I didn't have any trouble picking out his variations\".\nFor the Third Test, the home side were unchanged, while England replaced the injured Stewart with John Crawley and Gooch moved back to the top of the order. On the bowling front, DeFreitas was dropped again, making way for replacement Angus Fraser. England won the toss and elected to bat, and McDermott and Fleming once again made early inroads into the top order, reducing England to 20/3 in the first hour. Stubborn resistance from Atherton (88) and Crawley (72) added 174 for the fourth wicket. Four wickets fell at the end of the first day, however, leaving the tourists at 198/7 and with two new batsmen at the crease to ward off the new ball. during the next day's morning session, however, Gough scored up a quick half-century, and Malcolm hit 29 from 18 balls while Fraser battled made a dogged 27 and ended up being last man dismissed as the visitors batted into the afternoon session. McDermott's 5–101 from his 30 overs were bowled between visits to the dressing room to alleviate a bout of gastroenteritis.\nAustralia's reply struggled. Initially curtailed on the second afternoon when rain brought an end to proceedings, the top order fell to Gough and Malcolm, slipping to 39/5 with only Taylor (49) holding out. Bevan and Healy both fell to Fraser and Gough returned to mop up the tail, and picked up Taylor and Fleming in consecutive deliveries to end the innings and return figures of 6–49. The hosts' 116 was just sufficient to avoid the follow-on, and for the Australian bowlers found England tough to dismiss. Atherton's second half-century of the match (67) added 104 with Hick, and Thorpe helped add a further 97, but controversy arose when the England skipper called for the declaration on 255/2 with Hick stuck on 98. Keith Fletcher defended the captain's decision, insisting that the Worcestershire batsman was well aware that a declaration was imminent and he had been given the word: \"Graeme was told the declaration was coming very soon,\" Fletcher told the press conference that evening. \"He knew. The game has to come before the individual. The context of the match must come first.\" Hick himself, who would never go on to make an Ashes century, had no comment to make on the matter.\nAustralia were left to chase 449 for the victory and made a strong start, reaching 139 by the close of the fourth day without losing a wicket, and went on to 208 before Fraser had Slater (103, 10 fours) caught by Tufnell. An hour later, after a rain-lengthened lunch break, Malcolm uprooted Taylor's off stump for 113 and the intent to chase was quelled. Boon batted for an hour and three-quarters for 17, but after his dismissal Fraser (5–73) made the most of the damp conditions, delivering a series of seaming deliveries to the Australian middle order that saw Bevan, both Waugh brothers and Healy returned to the pavilion, Rhodes taking three catches. The fading light saw Hick, Tufnell and Gooch bowling at this critical time instead of Gough and Malcolm, with Warne and May batting out the last hour to save the draw, Malcolm spilled a catch from Warne off what appeared to be the final delivery of the match and the players walked off thinking the game was over, only to realise by the time they got to the pitch edge that there was still time for one more over.\nAtherton commented in resigned fashion that \"the umpires should know the rules\" but admitted that \"we would not have won the game\". He also called for the introduction of instant replay, after a run out situation earlier in the innings had gone against the tourists, \"the technology should be used,\" he said. \"It's a fail-safe method\". The England skipper also praised Gough's Man-of-the-match performance. Meanwhile, Taylor was relieved to escape with a draw and retain the Ashes. \"After being bowled out for 116, it's a relief to draw the Test. It'll probably turn to jubilation in an hour's time.\"\nFourth Test.\nAmidst the failure to qualify for the final of the One-day series and a drawn match with Victoria that saw Hick continue his good form with a century but little other joy, the Daily Mirror latched onto Gooch's poor form and suggested that he might miss out on the final two Tests and end his career in anti-climax while John Woodcock criticised the declaration at Sydney that denied Hick his century and the growing friction between the Captain and Chairman of Selectors.\nAs it turned out, England were forced into two changes but Gooch retained his place: Gough was already back in England and was replaced by DeFreitas, while Hick failed to recover from a back spasm that plagued him during his innings against the Victorians and Chris Lewis, playing club cricket in the area, came in for him. This left England to go into the match with an apparently uncomfortably long tail, wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, in poor form with the bat, batting as high as no.6. The hosts also made two changes, with leg-spinner Peter McIntyre replacing May, who had been unsuccessful in the first three tests but was also recovering from a hamstring pull suffered in the One-dayers and Greg Blewett also making his Test debut in place of Michael Bevan.\nThe tourists won the toss and made the most of good batting conditions. A rain-shortened first day saw England reach 196/2, with the skipper making 80, Gooch 47, and Gatting 50 not out by the close. Fleming picked up the two wickets to fall with but strained a hamstring early on the second day and left McDermott to take over the seam bowling duties. Gatting went on to make 117 (14 fours), but after a 75-run stand with Crawley England collapsed from 286–3 to 353 all out with McDermott and the spinners running through the middle and lower order. In reply, Slater and Taylor made their third century opening stand of the series, and although their work was partly undone by the efforts of Lewis and DeFreitas on day three, Blewett and Healy (74) appeared to take the game away from the visitors with a stand of 164. Blewett proceeded to his century the next morning (102 not out, 12 fours), but once Healy was caught behind off Malcolm the tail collapsed and the first innings lead was restricted to 66 runs.\nAustralia's attack was weakened further with McDermott struggling through stomach cramps, but with Mark Waugh taking command of the situation and bowling, England struggled. Thorpe (83) and Crawley (71) added 71 for the fourth wicket, but it was Crawley's partnership with DeFreitas that set ensured a close finish. DeFreitas's 88 from 95 balls (9 fours, 2 sixes), a Test-career best that included 22 off one McDermott over, helped set the Australians a target of 263 for victory in 67 overs.\nAfter safely making it to the lunch interval, the home side slipped to 23/4 in five overs, Malcolm bowling aggressively in a spell of 3–13. Mark Waugh and Blewett contrived to hold out for another hour, before Lewis (4–24) and Tufnell took further wickets. Healy (51 not out) did his best to marshal the tail, batting for two and a quarter hours and with Fleming, batting until well into the final hour, but Lewis eventually trapped the latter leg-before, and Malcolm (4–39) finished the job off by picking up McIntyre as well to round off an England victory.\nPost-match, Atherton was effusive about man-of-the-match DeFreitas: \"Daffy grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck\", the England captain acknowledged. The man himself was pleased but less excited. \"They bowled it short, I saw it and hit it. That's about it, really,\" he simplified. Aussie skipper Mark Taylor admitted that \"[t]hey've played better than us since Christmas\" and acknowledged his concern about their form, especially that of his key spin weapon. \"Warney is feeling a bit flat. He knows he's not bowling that well.\"\nFifth Test.\nDespite their success fielding five specialist bowlers at Adelaide, England brought in Mark Ramprakash from the England A tour of India to replace spinner Tufnell. The biggest concern in Atherton's mind was the aggressiveness of his fast bowlers – Devon Malcolm had been warned by the Match Referee to tone it down after directing Mark Waugh towards the pavilion in the Sydney Test – and the skipper was keen to see that it didn't stifle their effectiveness. Australia's selection was less straightforward, with some analysts predicting that Warne had either been overbowled or had an injury that was affecting his performance and would be left out of the side. Skipper Mark Taylor rubbished these reports though, claiming that his leg spinner simply \"had a niggle\", and \"wasn't bowling well\", but that it had \"nothing to do with injuries\" and that it was \"all to do with his action\", which was now remedied.\nIn the end, Australia made two changes to the bowling attack, neither of which involved Warne: Jo Angel came in for what would be his fourth and final Test appearance, and Glenn McGrath was recalled after missing the last three matches. The players to miss out were Fleming and McIntyre, leaving the Australians with a four-man attack completed by Warne and McDermott.\nTaylor won the toss and elected to bat on a typically hard and dry WACA surface. Slater played and missed at Malcolm early in his innings, but went on to make the most of being dropped three times by England fielders. Although Taylor and Boon departed in the first session, Slater and Mark Waugh (88) added 183 for the third wicket. Slater's 124, his third of the series, set up a dominant position for the hosts. \"I had my luck, but it was not my fault they were dropping the catches\" he remarked on the first evening. Steve Waugh was the other main contributor to Australia's total of 402, but was left stranded on 99 not out after a mix up with brother Mark, running for McDermott who was feeling a back strain.\nIn reply, England found themselves losing quick wickets. Atherton and Gatting both went in the opening overs to McGrath, but Thorpe and Gooch (37) added 72 before the latter and Crawley departed in quick succession to Mark Waugh. Ramprakash helped see England safely through to the close, but after a knock of 72 was the third of four very quick wickets in the afternoon session that saw the tourists slump to 295 all out despite Thorpe's 123 (218 balls, 19 fours).\nDuring Australia's second innings, Slater hit 45 from 55 deliveries before departing to Fraser and Angel, nightwatchman on the third evening, was run out by his captain, England reducing the Australians to 123/5. Blewett and Steve Waugh then hit a partnership of 203 at almost a run a minute. Blewett's 115 (158 balls, 19 fours) pleased the batsman who argued that \"I enjoyed this more [than my first Test century]... I'm rapt because we were in a bit of trouble when I came in.\" England's catchers dropped a total of eleven chances in the match, and by the time that Taylor declared at 345/8, England were left with 104 overs to score 453.\nMcDermott and McGrath drove ripped through the upper order in their opening spells to leave the visitors 27/6. Ramprakash and Rhodes scored a partnership of 68 for the seventh wicket, the former seduced into a lazy cut to gully by Mark Waugh's change of pace, ending the resistance as England stumbled to 123 all out, McDermott raising his series tally to 32 wickets.\nAtherton conceded after the match that the Australians had been the better team, and accepted blame for the series defeat, noting that \"...a captain stands and falls by results...I have not captained as well as I did in the West Indies.\" Meanwhile, his counterpart in the Australian side enthused about the back-up bowlers supporting Warne and McDermott, noting that \"I was very happy with McGrath's good pace and line. He'll trouble [the West Indian] players.\"\nSeries Summary.\nEngland.\nThe 3–1 result was a fair reflection of an Ashes series that was dominated by the Australians. Thorpe and Atherton led the way for England's batsmen, each scoring more than 400 runs in the series, but the rest of the top order struggled, with only Hick (in six innings) and Ramprakash (in two) also averaging over 40. Gooch and Gatting both retired from International cricket at the end of the tour, and it was generally felt by commentators that it was a tour too far for both of them, as they failed regularly with the bat (they scored one fifty and one century between them in 19 innings and averaged a combined 22.47) and contributed heavily towards England's malaise in the field.\nOf the bowlers, Gough was the most successful, picking up 20 wickets at 21.25. Ironically the best support for Gough came from Lewis (11 wickets at 22.64) and Fraser (14 at 27.79), even though both had been overlooked in the initial selection. Other bowlers' figures were badly affected by the dropped catches. McCague hardly bowled after his failure in the first Test, and Joey Benjamin didn't figure at all.\nThe captain pressed the need to look at England's younger players for selection and acknowledged that the fielding had been a particular problem, but ultimately conceded that his team had been beaten by a better side. He wasn't backed by the selectors, however, with Fred Titmus arguing that \"[a] youth policy should be the preserve of the England A team\" and noting that \"we would not have seen the best of Jack Hobbs, Tom Graveney and Jim Laker\" if they had been rejected because of their age. Others backed Atherton though: In his later book, \"The Botham Report\", Ian Botham criticised the failure to select Angus Fraser from the start, who Chairman of Selectors Ray Illingworth described \"just wasn't the man for the job\" and who \"never looked up to it\", noting that England's performances took a turn for the better once the Middlesex seamer was finally called up for the Third Test.; similarly, Devon Malcolm recalled in his autobiography that \"Goochie and Gatt shouldn't have been picked for that tour; they had declined at the highest level\" and that Atherton \"gave the appearance of being fed up of being lumbered with a group of players who wouldn't have all been his preferred choices. Getting sniped at by Illingworth from afar didn't help either.\"\nAustralia's Rod Marsh blamed England coach Keith Fletcher for the poor performances and for a negative attitude towards the series, criticising the coach's press conference comments in Adelaide. \"A team must always, always, play to win and even if you think that way you should never say it,\" he told radio listeners. \"'The best we can do is an honourable draw' – what a load of codswallop. If anyone is wondering why England have had such a hard time in Australia, there lies the answer\", but Fletcher refused to quit, citing a string of injuries and illnesses that had hampered the tour as the main cause of the team's lack of success and defending the inclusion of Gooch and Gatting, noting that \"[h]indsight is a brilliant thing, but there was not one person who would have left Graham at home at the start of the tour.\"\nAustralia.\nBy contrast, Australia were quietly happy with the series result, although in looking forward to their forthcoming tour of the West Indies, captain Mark Taylor was keen that his side got tougher. \"We can't let a Test slip away as happened in Adelaide. Do that against the West Indies and we could not win,\" he insisted, noting that \"[u]nlike England, they would not have dropped nine or ten chances in a Test.\"\nMichael Slater topped the run charts for the home side, compiling three centuries and 623 runs in the series at an impressive 62.30. The captain and Mark Waugh also scored more than 400 runs and seven batsmen averaged more than 35. They were led by Greg Blewett, who Taylor described as \"the find of the summer\".\nMcDermott (32 wickets at 21.09) and Warne (27 at 20.33) shouldered the burden of the bowling, racking up 489 overs between them, and although the main support bowlers were less effective with only Fleming consistent enough to merit note, Mark Waugh also chipped in with eight wickets including a career best 5–40 in a losing cause at Adelaide, but Angel, McGrath, McIntyre and May were disappointing."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1997",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured England in the 1997 season to play a six-match Ashes Test series against England. Australia, under Mark Taylor, won the series 3–2 with strong batting performances from Matthew Elliott supporting the decisive bowling of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie.\nEngland had enjoyed good form leading up to the series, with a 3–0 One Day International victory, and success in New Zealand; however, after winning convincingly in the first Test the host team struggled. Graham Thorpe and Nasser Hussain both scored over 400 runs for England, with Andrew Caddick the leading wicket-taker.\nThis was the only Ashes series between 1987 and 2005 in which England won a match before Australia had already taken an unassailable lead in the series.\nPrelude.\nThe previous series over the winter of 1994-95, hosted in Australia, saw the host nation win 3–1. Australia, however, entered the 1997 series with a number of injuries and poor form. Mark Taylor had also suffered what \"Wisden\" referred to as \"personal purgatory\", involving a pay dispute with the Australian Cricket Board. His captaincy was itself in question until April 1997. Matthew Elliott's selection and the reshuffle of Michael Bevan's position in the batting order also attracted media speculation.\nEngland, in contrast, were enjoying strong form. Alec Stewart had been named player of the year, and experienced Michael Atherton reselected as captain. In the media, \"The Daily Telegraph\" heralded a \"new England\". John Crawley's surprise selection for the ODI series was seen as a wise decision by Christopher Martin-Jenkins, while Australia lost warm-up practice at Durham due to rain.\nAustralia were whitewashed during the ODI Texaco series. Australian cricketer Ian Chappell in particular voiced his concerns over Taylor's responsibility. England, on the other hand, gained a sense of optimism about the coming Test series. Qamar Ahmed, of \"The Daily Telegraph\", wrote that \"I have rarely seen Australia bowl so badly and field so poorly. They were guilty of exactly that in the last three matches and their batting with their out-of-form captain Mark Taylor makes them even a lot fractious than they should be with the abundance of talent that they have on tour.\" Christopher Martin-Jenkins echoed such sentiments, stating that England's \"hopes of winning the Ashes are growing.\" Atherton himself wrote in the media of his pride regarding \"England's young lions\" during the ODI series.\nAustralia were not without their own confidence. Chappell highlighted the role of Shane Warne in the media, while England bowler Dean Headley was ruled out of the opening Test with an injury. Nick Knight and Phil Tufnell were both left out of the final eleven, and Dominic Cork also picked up an injury. Nevertheless, Australia entered the first Test under pressure.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nEngland won the Texaco Trophy 3–0.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nThe first Test saw 72,693 in attendance across its four days, bringing in £1,588,593 in revenue. Australia batted first after winning the toss, and rapidly collapsed to 54/8, before Warne and Michael Kasprowicz combined to bring Australia to 110 before the latter fell. Warne fell to Caddick three short of a half century, giving the England bowler a five-wicket haul, with Darren Gough and Devon Malcolm picking up three and two respectively. When England fell to 16/2, the pitch was initially blamed in the media, however Hussain and Thorpe scored a career-best 207 and 138 respectively in a 288-run partnership which became a record 4th-wicket partnership for England against Australia. Warne eventually dismissed Hussain, and Thorpe was removed by McGrath, however a late order career-best 53 not out from Mark Ealham saw England to 478 for nine declared.\nAustralia fared better in their second innings, reaching 477 all out thanks to \"a heroic century\" by Taylor – who scored 129 along with Greg Blewett who scored 125. Eliott scored 66, however no other Australian batsman passed 50. Three wickets were shared each between Gough, Robert Croft and Ealham, leaving England a target of 118 runs. Mark Butcher, on debut, was dismissed by Kasprowicz for 14, however Atherton reached 57 and Stewart reached 40 before hitting the winning runs. Stewart also passed 5,000 Test runs during his knock, and \"Wisden\" record that \"Victory brought an outpouring of elation, in front of the pavilion and across the country; people suddenly felt the little urn could, indeed, be recaptured.\" Hussain received the Man of the Match award for his double century.\nThis was the only Ashes series between 1987 and 2005 in which England won a match before Australia had already taken an unassailable lead in the series.\nSecond Test.\nThe second Test match was affected by rain. Australia had last been defeated at Lord's in 1934, however the draw here ended a run of 18 consecutive results for the visiting team. England lost the toss and were put in to bat, on a difficult pitch, and were dismissed for 77 thanks to eight wickets from McGrath, his best haul in tests to date. It was the lowest England total at Lord's since 1888, and the third best performance with the ball by an Australian Test player. Only Hussain, Thorpe and Gough reached double figures, Thorpe top-scoring with 21. Paul Reiffel took the two other wickets, and Australia quickly surpassed the low target with only two wickets down. Thanks to a knock of 112 from Elliott, Australia declared at 213/7. Stewart had left the field for part of the innings due to back spasms, and Crawley had kept wicket.\nEngland replied with a more solid 266 for four. Butcher and Atherton constructed the majority of the innings, with 87 and 77 respectively, and some quick scoring by Thorpe and Crawley – who both remained not out – allowed England to reach their score at 3.36 runs an over. The declaration came after Butcher fell, and the game had been safely batted out to a draw.\nThird Test.\nEngland brought in Dean Headley for his debut in the Third Test, while for Australia Jason Gillespie replaced Kasprowicz. Australia, batting first having won the toss, reached 235 runs thanks largely to a century by Steve Waugh, while Headley took four wickets and Gough three. Headley bowled an intimidating spell – coming \"straight into the action, striking Taylor on the helmet as he ducked into a bouncer in his opening over.\" Dropped catches, however, hampered England's bowling performance. Butcher hit 51 and Stewart 30 as England responded with 162, largely hemmed back by a six wicket haul from Warne, and three for McGrath. Butcher, dismissed by a stumping, provided Healy with his 100th dismissal in Ashes Tests.\nAustralia increased their lead with a second innings score of 395, thanks again to Steve Waugh's century, 116 runs on this occasion. His 14th century made him the first Australian batsman to score a hundred in both innings since 1989, and the first instance of this feat in a Test between Australia and England since Arthur Morris and Denis Compton in 1947. Australia left England 469 runs to win, and despite Crawley's knock of 83, England were dismissed for 200 runs, thanks to four wickets from McGrath and three for each of Warne and Gillespie. During the innings, Warne overtook Richie Benaud as the most successful Test leg-spin bowler, taking his 249th Test wicket. Australia levelled the series in front of a crowd which totalled 87,829 over the five days.\nFourth Test.\nEngland announced the same team for the First Test, apart from Mike Smith who was brought in over Caddick, while Australia lodged a complaint against David Graveney for his alleged involvement in a decision to change pitches two weeks before the Test. Australia won the toss and chose to bowl in the 36 overs permitted in a rain-affected first day. Beginning the second day on 103/3, England collapsed to 172 all out, thanks to a seven-wicket haul from Gillespie. Atherton scored 41 from 143 deliveries, but no other batsman passed 30. In response, Elliott (199) and Ashes debutant Ricky Ponting's maiden Test century (127) brought Australia to 501/9 declared, with an expensive five-wicket haul for Gough, who went for 149 runs.\nEngland attempted to regain control, however they struggled initially, falling to 89/4. A 123-run partnership between Hussain – his 105 being his second century of the series – and Crawley (72) gave England some hope, however five wickets for Reiffel dismissed England for 268. This innings and 61-run victory gave Australia a 2–1 lead with two matches remaining.\nFifth Test.\nEngland brought Malcolm and Caddick back into the team for the 5th Test, as well as the two Hollioake brothers. There were also concerns in the England camp regarding Stewart's form, and Gough failed a fitness Test with an inflamed knee. Australia won the toss and batted, reaching 427 all out thanks to five half-centuries from the top five batsmen, while four wickets were taken by Headley and three by Malcolm. England fell to 313 all out in reply, thanks largely to Stewart's 87. Warne and McGrath took four wickets each to keep England behind the Australian total.\nHealy and Ponting then led a quick-scoring attack, supported by a half-century from Blewett, to take Australia to 336 while wickets shared around the England bowlers, including three between the Hollioake brothers. Set 451 runs to win, England fell with a \"strange mix of strokeless submission and devil-may-care defiance\" to 186 all out, with Australia claiming an extra half-hour after stumps to defeat England on the 4th day. Only Thorpe with his 82 from 92 balls offered any resistance. Australia took an unassailable 3–1 lead, and pressure mounted on the England team and its management. The ECB had issued statements denying that Atherton had offered, or planned, to resign, and \"Wisden\" recorded: \"[This] crushing defeat cost England the series and the Ashes but not, this time, their captain. Mike Atherton withstood all the demands that he follow the example of his predecessor, Graham Gooch, who had fallen on his sword in similar circumstances four years earlier. But the public debate about his future did nothing to ease the pressure on Atherton.\" Peter Johnson later records that \"Atherton resolutely declined journalists' invitations to resign at once, though his wording suggested to many that he would answer differently when the series was over.\""

        "text": "In 2001, the Australia national cricket team toured England and Ireland to play county matches and the 2001 Ashes series. The Ashes series was played from 5 July to 27 August.\nAustralia comfortably won the Test series 4–1 and retained the Ashes, which were in their possession since 1989. The players of the series were Glenn McGrath from Australia and Mark Butcher from England. The England captain Michael Atherton finished his international career after the fifth and final test of the series.\nAs of 2023, this remains the last time Australia have won an Ashes series in England.\nBackground.\nThe five match Ashes series was played from 5 July to 27 August.\nPrior to the series, the Australian team played tour matches against English teams in:\nTour matches refer to County cricket matches and international one-day matches.\nThey also played a one-day series against Ireland. These games were played between the five matches played in the Ashes series.\nAustralia also played in the NatWest Series with England and Pakistan.\nAustralia team.\nCoach.\nThe coach of the team was John Buchanan, who coached the team between 1999 and 2007. Buchanan had previously led the Queensland cricket team to their first Sheffield Shield title. In his tenure as coach, Australia won three Cricket World Cups.\nCaptain.\nThe Australian team was captained by Steve Waugh who had captained the side since 1999 to what cricket editor S Rajesh described as their \"most successful peak in decades\".\nVice-captain was wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who was described as \"instrumental\" to the team's success. The Australian batting side was headed by Damien Martyn, with the \"Dream Team\", bowling side including Brett Lee, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie.\nSelection before the Tour.\nMuch of the team prior to the series had been playing in English County Cricket competitions. Through this, they made up 6 of the top 12 run scorers in two county divisions.\nDuring the selection of the team, batsman Justin Langer was originally not chosen by Steve Waugh. However, Justin Langer replaced Michael Slater for the last match of the Ashes series.\nThe selection committee for the 2001 team was Trevor Hohns, Andrew Hilditch, David Boon and Allan Border. All four were the selection committee from 2000 to 2005.\nChanges to the team.\nDue to the success of the team during the series the team remained unchanged between the tests. Between the 3rd and 4th Tests, Steve Waugh was injured after tearing his calf midway through the 3rd test but returned after a 19-day therapy plan.\nThe team had been successful previously holding a record of 16 consecutive wins between 1999 and 2001. In the series Gilchrist, Martyn, and both Waugh brothers made nearly 1500 runs together. McGrath and Warne were described as \"unstoppable\", combining 63 wickets at 18, becoming \"one of the most dominant one-two acts\" in an Ashes series.\nThe Australian team had 17 players. In a poll by the Australian Cricket Network among cricket fans, 7 players were named as the \"Best Australian Ashes players\". Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh, Gilchrist, Warne and McGrath all featured.\nInjury.\nGeneral.\nAccording to a study on the 2001 international cricket season, injuries ranged from 19.0 injuries per 10,000 players in domestic matches to 38.5 injuries per 10,000 players in One Day Internationals. This is, however, an average of Australian teams. Within the 2001 international matches there were 22.2 injuries per 10 000 player hours. Studies done on injuries in cricket rely on the definition of injuries being made clear, either incorporating any reasons for a player to miss a match or criteria for an injury including the roles a player may have in a series.\nTeam injuries.\nOriginally in the team party, Nathan Bracken was chosen to play in the one-day tests but injured a shoulder. Ashley Noffke was brought in to replace him but was replaced himself after damaging ankle ligaments at a practise. Brett Lee then was brought in to play in the one-day series, as well as the Tests.\nSteve Waugh injured himself between the Second and Third tests in the Ashes series, in a promotional game of squash between Waugh and No 1 Squash player Sarah Fitz-Gerald for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. He began to play in the Third Test but ripped his calf in the game having a 5-centimetre tear. Waugh missed the Fourth Test, but together with the Australian physio, he devised and successfully followed a 19-day recovery plan in order to return for the final test.\nIreland tour.\nCaptain Steve Waugh did not travel for the Ireland leg of the tour due to his calf injury. Adam Gilchrist was also not in Ireland, so Ponting was named captain for the series. In the team, Hayden and Mark Waugh had played in 1993 in Dublin, while Waugh, Langer, Ponting and McGrath had all played in Eglinton in 1997.\nThe Irish team had no players from the 1993 competition but Derek Heasley, Andy Patterson and Kyle McCallan had both played in 1997.\nEngland tour.\nAustralia played six other first-class and three other List A games.\nIn the first-class games Damien Martyn had the highest batting average with an average of 104.66 runs per game, with 9 games played. He also had the most runs between the English and Australian teams with 942 runs, followed by Ponting, Gilchrist and Mark Waugh with 844, 663 and 644 runs respectively.\nShane Warne took the most wickets in the first-class games with 42 wickets. He also took the most catches in the first-class series with 13 overall, followed by Mark Waugh and Ponting with 12 and 11.\nAdam Gilchrist took the most dismissals with 31, beating Seccombe with 10.\nThe Ashes Series.\n1st Test.\nEngland was all out for less than 300 runs in the first innings, despite a 103-run partnership between Alec Stewart and Andy Caddick for the 10th wicket. England collapsed in the second innings from 142/2 to be all out for 164.\n3rd Test.\nShane Warne was named man of the match for 8 wickets. Adam Gilchrist took 10 fours and made 54 with Gillespie taking 27. In the first innings they were all out for 122. Shane Warne took 6 for 33 in the first innings with Jason Gillespie taking 3 low order wickets making England out for 162. Steve Waugh had to retire from the game due to injury.\n4th Test.\nAustralia elected to bat first and held a lead of 138 after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia declared on 176/4, setting England a target of 315 for victory. They reached this with six wickets in hand, thanks to an unbeaten 173 by Mark Butcher. Butcher was named Player of the Match, for what Gilchrist described as \"one of the great Ashes innings\".\n5th Test.\nAustralia elected to bat first. In the first innings, Australia was 641/4 and chose not to bat again. Over England's two innings, Glenn McGrath took 7 wickets overall. In England's first innings, they scored 432 runs and in the second took 184.\nShane Warne was described as Player of the Match, with Mark Butcher and Glenn McGrath named as Players of the Series.\nPlayers of the Series.\nAustralian – Glenn McGrath.\nDuring the 2001 Ashes series, McGrath passed Dennis Lillie's record of 355 dismissals, becoming the highest wicket taker among Australian fast bowlers. He still holds that record, having extended it to 563 Test wickets. Internationally, he is second only to England's James Anderson with 690.\nMcGrath played all five matches in the Ashes series. He bowled the most maiden overs with 56, 14 ahead of Jason Gillespie on 42. He bowled 194.2 overs, conceding 542 runs. McGrath took the most wickets through the series with 32 with best figures of 7/76. The 2001 Ashes was described as a display of his consistent style.\nEnglish – Mark Butcher.\nButcher had not played for England since their tour to South Africa in 1999–2000, missing five straight tours between January 2000 and July 2001. However, a resurgence in form led to a call-up for the Ashes series.\nHe played in all five Tests, but after scoring just 14 runs across the two innings in the 3rd Test, he was due to be dropped for the 4th; however, the team's captain for the 2nd and 3rd tests, Michael Atherton, intervened and Butcher kept his place in the team. He went on to score 173 not out in the second innings in a performance described as \"amazing\", as England went on to win the match by 6 wickets. It was termed by Adam Gilchrist, the Australian wicket keeper, as \"one of the great Ashes innings\"."

        "title": "Michel Bergeron (ice hockey coach)",
        "text": "Michel Bergeron (born June 12, 1946) is a Canadian former ice hockey coach.\nCoaching career.\nBergeron began his coaching career behind the bench of a midget team from Rosemont, Quebec. During his second season, he led the team to a national championship. He then took over for the Trois-Rivieres Draveurs of the QMJHL, leading the team to two Memorial Cup appearances.\nIn 1980, Bergeron became an assistant coach for the Quebec Nordiques. Six games into the season, with the Nordiques sputtering to a 1-3-2 start, general manager and head coach Maurice Filion dropped his head coach's title and named Bergeron his successor. Bergeron remained head coach until 1987. His teams gained a reputation for playing a high scoring, quick paced game. As coach, Bergeron also devoted significant time to pursuing European players, adding the Stastny brothers after their defection from Czechoslovakia. His teams reached the postseason in each of seven years behind the Quebec bench, including two trips to the Wales Conference Finals.\nJust before the 1987 draft, Bergeron was traded to the New York Rangers for a first-round draft pick and $75,000, which was the first time a coach was traded in NHL history. In spite of on-ice achievements, Bergeron's relationship with the Nordiques front office had become rather strained in recent years. Nonetheless, his reputation as a strong motivator enticed the Rangers, who were seeking coaching stability. Bergeron was the franchise's 13th head coach in 12 years.\nBergeron's first season in New York saw the Rangers in a battle with the upstart and rival, New Jersey Devils, for the final playoff spot in the Patrick Division. A tie with the Winnipeg Jets in the second-to-last game of the season left the Rangers and Devils tied with 80 points each. However, the Devils had one more win, meaning that if both teams won their final game, the Devils would advance on the total wins tiebreaker. On the final day of the season, the Rangers easily defeated Bergeron's old team, the Nordiques, 3–0. Hours later, the Devils defeated the Chicago Blackhawks in overtime, 4–3. The Devils went to the playoffs, and the Rangers went home.\nWith two games remaining in the 1988–89 NHL season, general manager Phil Esposito fired Bergeron and named himself head coach for the remainder of the season. Even though the Rangers had secured a playoff spot, Bergeron had drawn the ire of Esposito by vocally requesting a contract extension; Esposito stating that the firing was rooted in \"philosophical differences.\"\nBergeron returned to Quebec during the 1989–90 NHL season, presiding over a ghastly 12-win season that is still the worst in Nordiques/Avalanche franchise history (both NHL and WHA). He was fired after the season. His 265 wins over two stints were the most in franchise history until current Avs coach Jared Bednar passed him in 2023. Due in part to the 1989-90 debacle, he still owns the most career losses in franchise history.\nIn December 1990, he was treated for a mild heart attack.\nLegacy.\nBergeron earned the nicknames of \"Le Tigre\" (\"The Tiger\") and \"Napoleon\", in reference to his fiery temper, small stature, and French lineage. Bergeron reportedly even got under the nerves of Cuban leader Fidel Castro; in 1964, Bergeron was the catcher on a travelling Canadian baseball team, and, despite the tradition of visiting teams showing deference to the Cuban executive during his appearances in games, Bergeron cut down Castro as he attempted to score.\nBroadcasting career.\nBergeron served as panelist on the popular French talkshow \"l'antichambre\" which is broadcast on RDS. He spent 6 years with RDS and he was nicknamed \"le capitaine\" on the talkshow. Bergeron quit RDS for TVA Sports on December 19, 2013. He is a panelist before and during games when TVA broadcasts NHL hockey. TVA Sports recently acquired the rights to broadcast 20 regular season Montreal Canadiens games in French.\nIn 2021 he was a competitor on \"Chanteurs masqués\", the Quebec adaptation of the \"Masked Singer\" franchise. He sang Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\" in costume as a whitecoat seal, but was the first person eliminated from the competition."

        "title": "Cricket Viktoria Magdeburg",
        "text": "Cricket Viktoria Magdeburg was a German association football club playing in the Cracau district of Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1897 out of the merger of \"FuCC Regatta Magdeburg\" und \"FC Gut Stoss Magdeburg\" and was originally a cricket team, one of the English sports alongside football and rugby becoming popular in continental Europe at the time. Interest in football grew quickly and in 1900 \"Cricket Viktoria\", along with local rival \"SV Viktoria 96 Magdeburg\", became founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association).\n\"Cricket Viktoria\" never developed any sort of national presence in the period leading up to World War II. \"CV\" played in the Gau Mittelelbe, a league of the Verband Mitteldeutscher Ballspielvereine (VMBV) where they won several regional titles in the 1910s and 20s, but were unable to advance out of league play and on to the Germany national team playoff rounds. In 1921 the football department of \"MTV 1848 Magdeburg\" joined the club.\nGerman football was re-organized in 1933 under the Third Reich into sixteen top flight Gauligen. At the time \"Cricket Viktoria\" played in the second division Bezirksklasse Magdeburg-Anhalt and on the strength of a first-place finish there earned promotion to the Gauliga Mitte. They played at the top flight until a last place finish and relegation in 1942 after the club had been weakened by the draft of many its players into the army. The team's best results were second-place finishes in 1936 and 1938.\nLike most organizations in Germany, including football and sports clubs, \"Cricket Viktoria\" was disbanded in 1945 by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany at the end of World War II. Late in the year the formation of new clubs was permitted and many former players joined \"SG (Sportgruppe) Magdeburg-Altstadt\". Others, such as future star Ernst \"Anti\" Kümmel joined \"SG Sudenburg\", which would soon become \"1. FC Magdeburg\".\nMany clubs in what would become East Germany underwent several name changes. \"SG Magdeburg-Altstadt\" become \"BSG Grün-Rot Stadt Magdeburg\" in 1949 and then \"BSG Einheit Magdeburg\" in 1950. This team's football department left to join \"BSG Aufbau Börde Magdeburg\" in 1952. \"Börde\" is still active today as \"MSV Börde 1949\".\nOn 6 June 2004 a new side calling itself \"Cricket 04 Magdeburg\" was established by the second-team footballers of \"WSG Cracau\".\nStadium.\nThe club first played its matches in the \"Großer Cracauer Anger\" (1897–1912). They later moved to the \"Cricketer Sportpark\", or \"Kricketerplatz\", located in the district of Cracau in the eastern part of Magdeburg, near \"Jerichower Strasse\" and \"Herrenkrugstrasse\", on property owned by the German military.\nThe opening match held there was a friendly against \"SpVgg Fürth\" on Sunday, 20 August 1922. The team from Fürth, one of the dominant sides of the time, beat \"Cricket Viktoria\" 8:0. In 1932 the stadium was modified and now had a capacity of 40,000. On 5 November 1933, the sold-out ground hosted the first match played by a Germany national team in Magdeburg. Germany drew 2–2 against Norway in front of 40,000 spectators.\nIn 1936, as part of the ongoing re-armament of the German military during the mid-1930s, the property was reclaimed by the army. The stadium was demolished and military barracks (Hindenburg Kaserne) were erected. After losing their ground, they moved to the \"Polizeistadion am Hasselbachplatz\" in the Altstadt district (1938–1952).\nNotable players.\nCricket Viktoria sent Ernst Jordan as a defender to the Germany national team in its first ever official international match on 5 April 1908. It was his first and only appearance for the side as he scored an own goal in a 3–5 defeat against Switzerland and his performance received poor reviews in the sports pages of the day."

He played from 1957 to 1967, and was a member of Baltimore's NFL championship teams in 1958 and 1959. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro in nine of his 11 seasons in the NFL. Parker was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1973.\nParker grew up in Macon, Georgia, and played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes under coach Woody Hayes from 1954 to 1956. He helped the Buckeyes win a national championship in 1954. As a senior in 1956, he was a unanimous All-American and won the Outland Trophy. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974.\nEarly years.\nParker was born in 1934 in Macon, Georgia. He grew up on a farm where he picked peaches and cotton as a boy. He began playing football at age 13. He played his first three years of high school football at Hudson and Ballard-Hudson High Schools in Macon. He moved to Ohio before his senior year and played for Scott High School in Toledo. He graduated high school in 1953.\nHe received first string honors by the \"Times\" at tackle for the 1952 season. Ref 1953 Scottonian.\nCollege football.\nParker played college football as a guard for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1954 to 1956, playing on both the offense and defense. Parker was known for his size, strength and quickness, and these talents, used for clearing a path for running backs. \nAs a sophomore, Parker helped lead the 1954 Ohio State Buckeyes football team to a perfect 10–0 record and the No. 1 ranking in the final AP Poll.\nAs a junior, Parker was a key blocker for 1955 Heisman Trophy winner Howard Cassady. At the end of the season, Parker was named as a first-team All-American at guard by the Football Writers Association of America, the Central Press Association, and \"Jet\" magazine. He was also selected by both the Associated Press (AP) and United Press (UP) as a first-team guard on the 1955 All-Big Ten Conference football team.\nAs a senior in 1956, Parker was listed at six feet, two inches tall, weighed 262 pounds, and helped lead the Buckeyes to a 6–3 record. At the end of the season, he received multiple honors, including:\nNFL career.\nParker was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the first round of the 1957 NFL draft as the eighth player selected overall. The Colts, with quarterback Johnny Unitas, relied on a passing offense very different from the running offense of Ohio State. Nevertheless, Parker soon came to be known as the premier pass blocker in the game.\nFrom 1957 until 1962, Parker played as an offensive tackle. He was selected to five Pro Bowl teams in those six years. In 1963 Parker moved to the offensive guard position, as a favor to his college coach Woody Hayes, to make room for another former Buckeye, Bob Vogel. Parker was selected to three more Pro Bowls from the guard position.\nParker has been called \"the best pure pass-blocker who ever lived. Knew all the tricks — the quick push-off, the short jab — that are legal now.\"\nParker injured his knee during a game against the Philadelphia Eagles on September 24, 1967. The injury ended Parker's streak of 139 consecutive games played for the Colts. He appeared in only three games in 1967 and announced his retirement in December 1967, explaining that he had been in pain since the injury and the knee had not improved. He noted at the time: \"I feel I can't do it. I can't slide to my right and I can't run.\"\nLegacy and honors.\nParker received numerous honors for his contributions to the sport. His honors include the following:\nFamily and later years.\nFrom 1964 to 1999, Parker operated a liquor store in Baltimore's Liberty-Garrison neighborhood. In 1999, he suffered a stroke and closed the store.\nParker had 14 children and 23 grandchildren. He died in July 2005 at the Lorien Nursing Home in Columbia, Maryland, at age 71. The cause of death was congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. He was buried at King Memorial Park, Windsor Mill Manor, Baltimore County, Maryland."

It was co-produced with Mike Hedges and was released on 16 March 1984 by Polydor Records as the first single from the band's sixth studio album, \"Hyæna\".\nContent.\nThe song was based on a piano-driven melody. Siouxsie Sioux explained the strong issue behind the lyric:\nThis is based on a programme I saw about a female version of Amnesty, called 'Les Sentinelles'. They rescue women who are trapped in certain religious climates in the Middle East, religions that view any kind of pre-marital sexual aspersion as punishable by death – either by the hand of the eldest brother in the family, or by public stoning. And there was this instance of a woman whose daughter had developed a tumour, and, of course, gossip abounded that she was pregnant. The doctor who removed the tumour allowed her to take it back to the village to prove that, no, it wasn't a baby – but they wouldn't believe her. The woman knew her daughter would have to be stoned to death so she poisoned her, out of kindness, to save her from a worse fate. Now this organisation has all these escape routes for women like her, mainly through the elder brother who pretends to have killed them. But once they've been saved, they can never go back. So the song starts, \"Kinder than with poison...\" I also used the imagery of \"He gives birth to swimming horses\", from the fact that male sea horses give birth to the children, so they're the only species that have a maternal feel for the young. It was, I suppose, an abstract way of linking it all together without being sensationalist. I remember just being really moved by that programme, and wanting to get the sorrow out of me.\nRelease.\n\"Swimming Horses\" was released on 16 March 1984 by record label Polydor. It peaked at number 28 in the UK Singles Chart.\nLegacy.\nThe piano motif was later re-used by Robert Smith as the basis for the Cure song \"Six Different Ways\"."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1946–47",
        "text": "The English cricket team in Australia in 1946–47 was captained by Wally Hammond, with Norman Yardley as his vice-captain and Bill Edrich as the senior professional. It played as England in the 1946–47 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They were regarded as a sound team which was just as strong as Australia, but due to the Second World War they were an ageing side (only Godfrey Evans was under 28) and their bowling depended heavily on Alec Bedser and Doug Wright, who were overused and exhausted as a result. Australia beat England 3-0 in a five-match series to retain the Ashes; England suffered the worst defeat in a Test series since losing 4–1 to Australia in 1924–25. Since 1881, Tests in Australia were played to finish. That rule was changed for this series, and for the first time in 65 years, a test played in Australia ended in a draw when the third test was drawn.\nThe MCC saw Hammond leading a \"Goodwill Tour\" of Australia to re-establish sporting relations after the Second World War, and was told that good sportsmanship was more important that winning the series, an attitude that prevailed into the 1950s and 1960s. The Australian captain Don Bradman was not so constrained and was determined to win the series, and win by a large margin. One English player said \"We are the first Ambassadors ever embroiled in a war while on a goodwill mission\". The goodwill aspect of the tour meant that Hammond could not publicly complain about the Australian umpires, who he regarded as incompetent.\nUnlike the Australians, the selectors preferred to use cricketers who had made their name in the 1930s and selection appeared to be on the basis of pleasing the English public, who only knew the older players. Only Alec Bedser, Godfrey Evans and Norman Yardley had played little or no first-class cricket before the war. Evans, Yardley and Edrich were late choices; Evans as Paul Gibb's understudy, Yardley as vice-captain despite a poor season as an amateur had to be vice-captain and Bill Edrich after he made 222 not out against Northants. Eric Hollies was thought unlucky not to be picked after he took 184 wickets (15.60) including 10/49 in an innings against Notts – 7 bowled and 3 lbw – but he failed in 1950–51. To be fair, few new names suggested themselves; the 26-year-old Reg Simpson had batted well for the RAF in India, but made only 592 runs (24.66) in 1946, the 23-year-old Trevor Bailey was seen only as a good fielder, making 412 runs (31.69) and taking 37 wickets (24.40), and the 24-year-old Jim Laker only took 8 wickets (21.12).\nManager.\nThe manager was Major Rupert Howard of Lancashire who had also managed the last tour, Gubby Allen's \"Goodwill Tour\" of 1936–37. He knew Hammond well and they took to touring the country in a Jaguar lent to them when they arrived in Australia. Unlike later tours Howard was in charge of both the social calendar and public relations as well as the finances, though they tended to leave the nut and bolts of moving the team around to the baggage-master and scorer Bill Ferguson. The 66-year-old scorer had toured with the MCC since 1907–08 and devised the famous Ferguson Charts which gave greater detail than other scorecards, noting each ball bowled by from which bowler to which batsman. He also invented the radial scoring chart which shows the directions in which a batsman scored his runs.\nCaptain.\n\"Like other brilliant natural sportsmen to whom success has come easily Hammond had little apparent understanding of the problems faced by less gifted mortals, nor did he seem to appreciate the value of the personal word of cheer and advice. He could be very good company when in the right vein, but there were bleak, moody spells which were apt to coincide with his own failures and those of the side...Wally found himself in closer rapport with his manager than with his team, and they were apt to make the many long journeys in a Jaguar, leaving the team to follow by train in the care of Yardley and of the famous old baggage-master, 'Fergie'.\"\nBatsman.\nWalter Reginald Hammond – better known as Wally Hammond - had been a brilliant young batsmen, but in 1928–29 had forsaken the hook, the cut and the glance and played \"through the V\", making a record 905 runs (113.12) by creaming the ball through the covers. \"Striding down the pavilion steps at Lord's like a stately white galleon in full sail\" he would go to the middle where \"he hammered the ball with imperious power...Hammond hardly seemed to give the bowler a chance, even though he attacked the bowling constantly\" Hammond was recognised as the greatest batsman in the world, is still regarded as one of the greatest players in cricket, and was ranked 9 in ESPN's Legends of cricket. In 1932–33 he made 227 against New Zealand in the First Test after Herbert Sutcliffe and Eddie Paynter had been dismissed for ducks and 336 not out in the next with 34 fours and 10 sixes, the fastest triple century in Test cricket and his series average of 563.00 is unlikely to be exceeded. In 1937 he overtook Jack Hobbs' aggregate of 5,410 Test runs, and his final total of 7,249 runs (58.45) remained a record for 33 years until surpassed by Colin Cowdrey in the 1970s. On the tour he notched up his 167th and last first class century, his 36th first class double century (breaking Bradman's record) and became the seventh man to make 50,000 first class runs after W.G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Phil Mead, Frank Woolley, Patsy Hendren and Herbert Sutcliffe. As a slip fielder \"he had no superior in the world\", he was the first fielder to take 100 catches in Tests and his final tally of 110 was a record until Cowdrey beat it in 1968. Hammond was also a Test class fast-medium swing bowler who batsmen compared to Maurice Tate, but he limited this bowling so he could concentrate on his batting.\nRivalry with Bradman.\n\"In my opinion the two great players were jealous of one another. There were times in the series when I felt it was not so much a battle between England and Australia as a battle between Bradman and Hammond.\"\nIt was Hammond's misfortune to live in the same age as Don Bradman, the greatest batsmen of them all. Bradman made 974 runs (139.14) in 1930 and thereafter when Hammond made a century Bradman would make a double century, if Hammond struck 200, Bradman would make 300. When England amassed 903/7 at the Oval in 1938 Hammond waited until he had medical assurance that Bradman was unfit to bat before declaring and England won by an innings and 579 runs. Bradman never forgot this – or Bodyline – and when Hammond arrived to play a sporting tour to re-establish cricket after the war he was angered by the Australian captain's determination to win. In the First Test, The English team believed Bradman to have been caught by Jack Ikin off Bill Voce when 28; Bradman believed the ball had bounced straight after hitting the bat (a 'bump ball') and refused to walk. The umpires concurred that Bradman was not out, after which Hammond glared at him and said tensely, \"That's a fine way to start a Test series.\" Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and did the same in the Second Test when Ikin caught him off Alec Bedser at 22, Bradman refused to budge and made 234. Hammond thought this was gamesmanship and refused to talk to Bradman for the rest of the tour except to call the toss. Nevertheless, Hammond refused to be drawn into a public war, he did not make official complaints or even reveal to the press his concerns about umpiries, poor wickets, heavy rollers and aggressive fast bowling. \"He displayed tact and diplomacy in the interests of cricket, and wherever they went his colleagues were welcomed and liked.\"\nEngland captain.\nHammond was made captain of England in 1938 when he achieved amateur status through being given a top job in a tyre company. This was the age of the \"Shamateur\", when cricketers were given lucrative posts so that they would qualify for amateur status and captaincy of their county and country. He was with the RAF in South Africa during the war, but returned to play in 1945 and in the first full county season in 1946 made 1,783 runs (84.90) including six centuries in seven innings, making him easily the best batsman in England. Though the old guard at the MCC disliked having an ex-professional as England captain Hammond had no rivals to the post. On his arrival in Australia the news broke that he was divorcing his wife of 17 years to marry a South African beauty queen and the press had a field day. Hammond made centuries in his first two innings on the tour, 131 off Northam (with 19 fours and 4 sixes) and 208 against Western Australia, but suffered from fibrositis and let Yardley captain most of the early tour games. Hammond proved to be aloof and distant and at 43 was a generation older than the rest of his team, who held in him awe. Amateur captains used to readily consult their senior professional, but Hammond the ex-pro rarely sought anybody's advice, and \"sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him 'just letting the game go on'\". He ordered his batsmen to stay in their crease and not attack the bowling and had his best bowlers running around the outfield between overs. In the Tests his highest Test score was only 37 and simply failed to concentrate as he used to; \"When I consider the hours I have spent against men like Grimmett and O'Reilly, never taking the slightest chance and patiently waiting for the loose ball to come along, I cannot understand why in 1946 I tried to hit spin bowlers off their length before I had been at the wicket ten minutes\". Although averse to public speaking Hammond was very popular with the Australian public and was cheered whenever he appeared. One newspaper told its readers \"See him while you can. Your grandsons will feel you have let them down if you haven't seen him on their behalf\". However, Hammond came \"as a cricket god, only to leave a failure both as a batsman and a captain\". He retired on his return to England and moved to South Africa, where he remained detached from cricket until he took to the habit of visiting M.J.K. Smith's touring team just before he died in a car accident in 1965.\nBatting.\n\"It was a formidable array of run-getters who on past efforts appears to tower above everything we could put in the field, and in the absence of O'Reilly the position seemed bleak and without hope. I asked Kippax what he thought...He said \"If Hutton, Compton and Hammond are anywhere near their pre-war form I would be willing to concede them 250 runs an innings and ask them not to bat\".\"\nOpening batsmen.\nLen Hutton had made a record 364 in England's 903/7 declared at the Oval in 1938, still the highest score made by a batsman in an Ashes Test. The Yorkshire batsman was unlikely to match this on his first tour of Australia and he failed expectations until the last two Tests. He had broken his left arm in an accident on a commando course while a sergeant in the Army Physical Training Corps sergeant in the war and after an operation using 46 stitches, grafting bone from his leg onto his arm, which was left 2 inches (5 cm) shorter and weaker than his right. Hutton managed to recraft his technique, using a specially lightened bat, and even improved his batting average after the war. He was the target of Lindwall and Miller's \"opening blitz\", but his only batting injury was when he was caught on the chin by the New South Wales fast bowler Ginty Lush and taken to hospital just before the Fifth Test. He also suffered from tonsillitis and had to 'retire ill' after reaching 122 in the Fifth Test at Sydney. He was absent for the rest of the match and was flown back to England for a throat operation immediately afterwards. Even so, he topped the England and MCC batting averages on the tour despite bearing the brunt of the Australian fast bowlers and he and Washbrook added 138, 137 and 100 for the first wicket in successive innings, matching the record of Hobbs and Sutcliffe in 1924–25. In 1948–49 they put on 359 against South Africa, still the highest opening stand for England in Test cricket. Cyril Washbrook was the Lancastrian half of the Roses partnership, a batsman noted for his daring hooking and incisive cutting, though he proved a model of self-denial when England needed him. As a selector in 1956 he famously recalled himself, came in at 17/3 and made a match winning 98. The third man was Laurie Fishlock, a popular sportsman who was a left-handed batsman for Surrey and a winger for Crystal Palace and Southampton. He had toured Australia in 1936–37, but then as in 1946–47 he injured his hands, was unable to play for weeks at a time and his form suffered as a result. According to one selector he was only chosen because the public expected him to go.\nTop order batsmen.\nS/L Bill Edrich had been a bomber pilot during the war and won the DFC in the \"RAF's most audacious and dangerous low-level bombing raid\" of 1941. A gutsy batsman he was \"almost indifferent to his own safety. No bowler is too fast to hook; no score too large to defy challenge\" and stood up to the bouncers of Lindwall and Miller. Returning to England in 1947 he became an amateur and made a record 3,539 runs (80.43) with 12 centuries, a total only exceeded by his Middlesex Twin Denis Compton who made 3,816 runs (90.85) and 18 centuries in the same season. Compton was the golden boy of post-war cricket \"illuminating the seemingly impossible stroke and playing shots which are so late that they appear to be afterthoughts.\" He was restricted by Hammond's orders to stick to the crease as he liked to walk down the pitch to upset the slow bowlers – relying on his quick eye to keep him out of trouble – and was a shadow of himself until the Fourth Test when he ignored the captain's advice and made two centuries. His most famous stroke was the \"Compton Sweep\" in which he would pivot and drive the ball to long leg. Many others tried to copy this \"backward drive\" with fatal results, it was a product of Compton's own genius. Young Joe Hardstaff was the son of Joe Hardstaff of Notts and England and was a noted stylist \"all ease and elegance\" He had toured Australia in 1936–37, but failed to make a century and his Test career was stunted by the enmity of Gubby Allen. His selection was based on an innings of 205 not out against India in the Lords Test, but he had an otherwise poor season and failed on the tour.\nMiddle and lower order batsmen.\nThe MCC chose a number of all-rounders for their team, but none of real quality. The balding and bespectacled Paul Gibb had a sensational tour of South Africa before in 1938–39, when he hit 473 runs (59.12) and two centuries, but in Australia was found to have a weakness against leg-spin and failed. He was chosen for the First Test ahead of Godfrey Evans because of his batting ability, but Evans proved to be a decent batsman, a perky, attacking player who tried to take a run off every ball, but in the Fourth Test he went for a record 95 minutes before scoring while Compton made a century at the other end. At 28 Jack Ikin was one of the younger English players on the tour and apart from five first class matches in 1938 and 1939 he was a post-war player. Not noted for his footwork or strokeplay he was a gritty left-hander who was picked even though he only made one century for Lancashire in 1946. He was popular in Australia as he was a Tobruk Rat who had fought alongside the Australian 9th Division in North Africa. Norman Yardley was a sensible player who liked to play his strokes on the leg-side and though he never made a Test century was a good man in a crisis. James Langridge, Peter Smith and Bill Voce were bowlers who regularly made runs and even centuries for their counties, but Doug Wright's only hundred had become before the war and afterwards was relegated to the bottom of the batting order. Alec Bedser was a tailender who was capable of hitting a few runs on occasion and Dick Pollard's lack of batting ability was cited as one of the reasons why he was not picked for a Test in the series.\nBowling.\n\"Bill Edrich did some service as a fastish bowler with a slinging action while Norman Yardley's all-round skill won him a place in all the Tests. With his deceptively plain-looking medium-pace he actually took Bradman's wicket in three successive Test innings, and without any help from a fielder at that. But our out-cricket was simply not good enough. Wright was the best bowler (23 at 44 runs apiece), Bedser was still an enthusiastic and tireless learner (15 at 54), but Bill Voce aged 37, in one of the hottest Australian summers, could not recapture the old magical fire.\"\nPace bowlers.\nLike the batsmen the England bowlers were mostly old hands who had been playing before the war, unfortunately old bowlers rarely do well in Australia and they suffered. Bill Voce was a name well-known down under, he had been Harold Larwood's left-arm new-ball partner in the Bodyline series of 1932–33 and had taken 8/66 using the same tactics when the Australians played Notts in 1934. He was allowed on the \"Goodwill Tour\" of 1936–37 only after a public apology and took 17 wickets in the first two Tests to see England go 2–0 up in the series, but then he developed a muscle strain and Australia won the last three Tests. In 1946 he was 37 years old, the most senior England player after Hammond, but only a shadow of his former self. He failed to take a wicket in the Tests and was sidelined with a leg strain. Voce had been a spinner in his youth (until he saw Larwood bowl) and Hammond asked him to switch to slow bowling in the middle of the tour, but it was too late for him to change. Like Voce Dick Pollard was granted leave by the army to tour Australia, but was 34 years old, overweight and found that his swing bowling did not take to Australian conditions. He had taken 25 wickets (23.64) in the Victory Tests and was unlucky to not be chosen for a Test in the series, but still had some good seasons for Lancashire on his return home. The medium-fast bowling of Alec Bedser was reckoned to be the equal to that of Maurice Tate despite his poor figures, and he improved tremendously on tour. Making his debut against India at the age of 28 Bedser took 11/145 in his first Test and 11/93 in his second. In Australia he was overbowled and exhausted and found that his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this he gripped the ball across the seam like a spinner and the result was an in-swinging leg-break which would take 30 wickets (16.03) on his return in 1950–51. Don Bradman wrote \"the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps.\" Bedser would take 236 wickets in Tests (a record until 1963) and was the mainstay of the England bowling attack in the decade after the war. Bill Edrich was an enthusiastic fast bowler who could generate a fair pace off a short run up, but his greatest asset was a willingness to bowl. Nevertheless, he was given the new ball in the Second Test, returned the best figures (3/79) and top-scored in both innings with 71 and 119. Norman Yardley was one of the finds of the tour, a 'bits and pieces' all rounder called on to bowl due to the failings of others he dismissed Bradman three times in a row and proved to be a valuable support bowler.\nSpin bowlers.\nDoug Wright was seen as England's trump card when he arrived in Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball fiercely and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.\nFielding.\n\"His leg side keeping was on occasions as superlative as his nimble footed agility was amazing. He was always in top gear and continually chasing balls, even to a few yards of the fence, so intense was his enthusiasm. Evans loves cricket. Every minute in the middle brings him untold joy and pleasure, just as his acrobatic acts thrilled all who saw him.\"\nWicketkeepers.\nPaul Gibb was the first choice wicketkeeper at the start of the tour and hailed as the new Les Ames. An amateur batsman for Yorkshire he was a part-time wicketkeeper who was chosen to support Ames in South Africa in 1938–39, though in the end he played in all the Tests as a batsman. The 41-year-old Ames retired as Kent's wicketkeeper after the war in favour of Godfrey Evans, though he continued to play as a batsman until 1950. Evans was taken as the reserve keeper and as Doug Wright's county keeper was thought to have the edge over Gibbs, but was still learning his trade and had dropped Bradman in the game against South Australia. Both keepers fumbled chances on the tour, but Evans, playing in only his second full season of cricket was seen as the most improved player in the team and took lessons from Bert Oldfield who \"did everything he could to assist him to attain the superb heights he ultimately reached\". In the end Hammond chose Gibbs for the first Test, but Evans came in for the Second and thereafter remained England first choice for 13 years. His presence made an immediate difference and improved the England fielding all round. The Australians made over a thousand runs before Evans conceded a bye.\nFielders.\n\"MCC missed chances innumerable, and, looking back over one's cuttings, it comes as a surprise to read how poor the English fielding, and especially the catching, was on this tour.\"\nThis was one of the last teams to use old fashioned practice of putting the old men in the in-field and the young men in the out-field. As a result, Bill Voce was put in the slips and James Langridge in the gully, so many catches went begging. Meanwhile, the bowlers Doug Wright and Alec Bedser tired themselves chasing the ball around the ground when they should have been resting. Bill Edrich and Len Hutton were specialist slip fielders, Denis Compton was a good fielder anywhere and Jack Ikin took 31 catches in his 18 Tests and \"as a fielder he had no superior in the slips or at short leg\". Cyril Washbrook was an excellent cover fieldsman who flaunted his ability to throw down the stumps like a bullet and \"if the runs he saved could have been added to those he made he would have boasted an aggregate to make Bradman envious\". Australian batsmen soon learnt not to run if the ball went anywhere near him.\nMCC touring team.\nBy the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if their initials were used at all.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1946–47 Ashes series\""

        "text": "Freddie Brown captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1950–51, playing as England in the 1950-51 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They were regarded as a weak team - some critics wanted to cancel the tour - and failed to regain the Ashes. However, these facts do not tell the whole story as the inspirational Brown exposed flaws in the powerful Australian team. By winning the Fifth and final Test he ended Australia's record of 26 Tests without defeat and paved the way for England's victories in 1953, 1954-55 and 1956.\nSelection.\n\"The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced players and we paid the penalty. I'm sure if we had selected one or two solid players such as Jack Robertson, Dennis Brookes, Jack Ikin and Bill Edrich we would have won the Ashes - in spite of once again being caught on a glue-pot at Brisbane. Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and we won the last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches. In spite of the critics the bowling proved adequate and Freddie Brown did a grand job in view of the shortcomings of the side. To me the annoying part was that we had players in England who could have won the series for us.\"\nIn selecting their team for Australia the MCC selectors (Sir Pelham Warner, Harry Altham, Gubby Allen, Les Ames, William Findlay, Tom Pearce, Walter Robins, Brian Sellers and Bob Wyatt) made the mistake on relying on experience on one hand and youth on the other, but with little between. In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less. The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932–33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; the rest of the team had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954–55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle. Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either. In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3–1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3–0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4–0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.\nManagers.\nThere were two managers of equal rank; Brigadier Michael Green, a career Army officer who had played for Gloucester and Essex and was the Secretary of Worcestershire County Cricket Club, was in charge of the social calendar and public relations, and John Nash, Secretary of Yorkshire County Cricket Club since 1931, controlled the finances. This was the last tour of the 70-year-old scorer Bill Ferguson, who had toured with the MCC since 1907-08 and devised the famous Ferguson Charts which gave greater details than other scorecards, noting who bowled each ball, who batted and where it was fielded. He also invented the radial scoring chart which show the directions in which a batsman scored his runs.\nCaptain.\n\"England's popular captain did a magnificent job both as an individual unit of the Test team and as captain of it. His unstinted devotion to his job and the unselfish manner in which he delved in with a will when the going was hardest won the admiration of all Australian enthusiasts and met a fitting reward when England emerged victorious from the Fifth Test at the end of the tour.\"\nFrederick Richard Brown was a veteran of Douglas Jardine's Bodyline side of 1932-33 and was Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1933. Born in Peru and educated in Chile and Cambridge University he was a big-hearted, self-confident red-headed all-rounder usually seen wearing a white silk handkerchief round his neck, with a big grin and an avuncular pipe. Over six feet tall and weighing 15 stone (over 200lbs or 100 kilos) he loved to attack the bowling. Captured with Bill Bowes at Tobruk in 1942 Brown spent most of the Second World War in prisoner-of-war camps in Italy and Germany, where they organised games of cricket, baseball and rugby and lost over 60lbs (30 kilos) before being liberated by the Americans. A leg-spinner for Surrey before the war he became a medium-paced seamer in the late 1940s and organised cricket while working as a welfare officer in a Doncaster colliery. When the coal mines were nationalised Brown lost his job and became the captain and assistant-secretary of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1949. From being in seventeenth and last place in the County Championship in 1948 (and failing to win a county match between 1934 and 1939) Brown led Northants to sixth place in 1949. He was rotated in the England captaincy in 1949–50 with George Mann and Norman Yardley without success. He drew twice against a weak New Zealand in 1949 and lost to the West Indies in 1950. After Mann and Yardley had turned down the Ashes tour Brown impressed the selectors by hitting a six into the Lord's Pavilion while smashing 122 out of 131 runs inside two hours as captain in the Gentlemen v Players match, followed with three quick wickets, and he was offered the post the same afternoon. This was still the age when the England captain had to be a gentleman, even if he was a 'passenger' in the team, Brown having made only 233 runs (23.30) and taken 14 wickets (40.79) in his 9 Tests. Despite his age (he turned 40 on tour) Brown had the most successful series of any England captain in Australia; Taking 18 wickets (21.61) and making 210 runs (26.25), third in the batting averages (behind Len Hutton and Reg Simpson) and in the bowling averages (behind Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser). Brown's jovial bonhomie and refusal to admit defeat won him many fans in Australia and he was a magnificent ambassador for the game, a role which the MCC regarded quite as important as sporting success, and the scorer Bill Ferguson said it was the easiest, happiest tour he had been on for over 40 years. After losing 4–1 to Australia he won 1–0 in New Zealand and beat South Africa 3–1 at home in 1951. At 42 he was recalled to the England team for the 1953 Lord's Test, where took 4/82 and hit 50 runs to ensure a vital draw in the year England regained the Ashes. Like many amateur captains he was happy to take advice from the senior professional and 'Brown conferred with Len Hutton before he made a bowling change...there was little room for doubt...that Brown had tremendous respect for Hutton's advice on the cricket field', as well he should as the Yorkshireman was recognised as 'a tactical genius, whose advice was often sought', Actually making a northern professional vice-captain was a step too far and this office was granted to the debonair Middlesex batsman Denis Compton, the first professional cricketer to hold that office in living memory. Though Brown also conferred with Compton on the field, it was only after he had spoken to Hutton. The young Trevor Bailey surprised everybody by drawing up plans for dismissing and containing every Australian batsmen, which were used to great effect in the series.\nBatting.\n\"All Australia honoured Hutton as the world's best batsman, and never did a man play harder or more successfully on his country's behalf...One man cannot make a cricket team, but Len Hutton did the next best thing in Australia last winter. He stood alone. Superb in craftsmanship, magnificent in the hour of stress, veritably a giant among all batsmen and worthy of ranking with such famous names as Hobbs, Sutcliffe, Woolley, Hammond...they were masters of all they surveyed. So was Hutton.\"\nRarely has the batting of a team been so dominated by one man as Len Hutton did the England side of 1950–51. He made 533 runs at an average of 88.83, 50 runs more than the next man Reg Simpson (38.77) and all the others except Freddie Brown (26.25) averaged under 20. He had broken his left arm in an accident on a commando course while a sergeant in the Army Physical Training Corps in the war and after an operation using 46 stitches, grafting bone from his leg onto his arm, which was left 2 inches (5 cm) shorter and weaker than his right. He was forced to review his technique and use a lightened bat, but his defence was flawless and he was an expert on 'sticky dogs' like Brisbane and averaged higher in post-war Tests than in his youth, when he had made the record score of 364 at the Oval in 1938. The Yorkshireman was saddled with the heavy burden of knowing that England depended on his skill and was the prime target of the Australian fast bowlers Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. Of Jack Iverson Hutton told Miller \"Ah'll show thee how to play 'im\", but never quite fathomed his mystery spin. England had one other great batsmen, the 'golden boy' Denis Compton whose heroic strokeplay had enthralled the crowds in 1946-47 and 1948. Unlike Hutton he had no inhibition about playing his shots, but had spent much of 1950 suffering from the knee injury that would plague his career. He went on the tour against the advice of his doctor, who warned that his leg may be immobilised and took pain-killing drugs throughout the visit. It is unlikely that any batsman has had such a checked tour as Compton in 1950–51, he averaged 7.57 in the Tests and 92.11 in the other First Class matches, a difference of nearly 85 runs. His loss of form at the highest level was a severe blow to England's chances. Reg Simpson came a poor second to Hutton in the Test averages, his 349 runs (38.77) being almost entirely dependent on his 156 not out on his 31st birthday in the Fifth and final Test. This innings was the finest of his career, first adding 131 with Hutton and 64 out of a stand of 74 for the last wicket to put England 103 runs ahead and gave them their first victory against Australia since 1938. It was the highest score of his Test career and he also made 269, his highest First Class hundred against the Sheffield Shield Champions New South Wales. He was a fearless and effective player of fast bowling, but had a habit of getting out to spin bowlers, who he regarded with contempt. Hutton's regular opening partner was the Lancashire stalwart Cyril Washbrook, with whom he added 359 against South Africa in 1948–49, still a record opening stand for England. He averaged over 50 against Don Bradman's 1948 Australians, but couldn't handle the mystery spin of Jack Iverson. Apart from the captain's own efforts - Freddie Brown came third in the England Test averages with 210 runs at 26.25 - the rest of the England batting was woefully poor. John Dewes had amassed 1,262 runs (78.88) for Cambridge and 739 (61.58) for Middlesex in 1950 with defensive prods and pushes. For Cambridge he added 343 vs the West Indies and 349 vs Sussex with David Sheppard, but they fared worse when not playing on the friendly wicket at Fenner's. Sheppard is best remembered for taking holy orders, becoming the first Reverend to play Test cricket, becoming captain of Sussex and England and later Bishop of Liverpool. Gilbert Parkhouse was a Welsh middle order batsman who was sent in to open for Glamorgan in 1950 and made such as success of it that he broke the county record by making seven centuries in a season. The teenage Brian Close was chosen after he took 100 wickets and made 1,000 runs in 1949 and became England's youngest ever player aged 18 years and 149 days. Despite respectable all-round figures Close never reached the heights expected of him in Test cricket, though his tough, uncompromising, captaincy of Yorkshire, Somerset and England would become the stuff of legend. Trevor Bailey's barnacle-like qualities were already apparent and this notorious stonewaller tended to substitute stubbornness for strokeplay, though he made few runs in this series.\nBowling.\n\"With thirty Test Match wickets to his name, Alec Bedser founded England's eventual success. He toiled for hours without complaint, and never once looked annoyed at the missing of a catch, or at a rejected l.b.w. appeal. A great bowler, and an example to all who aspire to cricketing fame. The schoolboys who cheered him, and the elderly folk who applauded politely, all realised one thing. In Alec Bedser England had the best bowler Australia had seen for years, and friend and foe alike admitted the fact.\"\nAlec Bedser dominated the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) as much as Len Hutton did the batting and by the end of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950–51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.\nFielding.\n\"It was not only that catches were missed. The picking up was slovenly and the returns to the wicket badly directed. There was no anticipation or cutting off of runs by the men in the deep, and quite often Brown had to halt a bowler in his run-up to direct a fieldsmen to his proper position.\"\nEngland failed to match the Australians' high standards of fielding and were nicknamed \"Brown's Cows\" by the Australian barrackers. They dropped six catches in a match against Victoria and made frequent mistakes in the state matches. However, they made a considerable improvement in the Tests with \"...first class work in the field, in direct contrast to the slovenly and often lackadaisical displays in the previous games of the tour\". Even so, they never reached the heights of catching and fielding displayed by the Australian team. Both Brown and Alec Bedser weighted 15 stone (over 200 lb or 100 kilos) and were particularly ungainly in the field, but their bucket-like hands picked up 9 catches and Brown twice caught and bowled Keith Miller. Godfrey Evans was the outstanding wicket-keeper of his generation whose enthusiasm could energise a fielding team and always entertained the crowd with his antics. His deputy was Arthur McIntyre, who kept wicket for Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and Tony Lock in the Surrey side that would win the County Championship seven times in a row in 1952–58. Len Hutton was a good slip and would pick up 9 catches in the series and Trevor Bailey took some great catches in the gully. Unfortunately the MCC had no other slip fielders and they were joined by Gilbert Parkhouse, who hated the role and frequently dropped catches. John Dewes was a good outfielder, but the rest of the team failed to impress and a picture of John Warr was used to illustrate how \"not\" to take catches.\nMCC Touring Team.\nBy the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if their initials were used at all.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1950-51 Ashes series\"\nCeylon.\nThe English team had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured England in the 1953 season to play a five-match Test series against England for The Ashes.\nEngland won the final Test to take the series 1–0 after the first four Tests were all drawn. England therefore recovered the Ashes for the first time since losing them in 1934.\nAustralian squad.\nHassett, Morris, Harvey, Johnston, Lindwall, Miller, Ring and Tallon had toured England with the 1948 Australian team, known as \"The Invincibles\". Davidson, de Courcy and Hill had not played Test cricket before this tour: all three made their debuts during the 1953 Ashes series.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test at Trent Bridge.\nRain washed out play entirely on the fourth day and prevented a resumption until half past four on the last day. Before that, Alec Bedser, with seven wickets in each innings, had bowled England into a strong position after they trailed by 105 on the first innings. In Australia's first innings, Morris, who made 67 and Hassett put on 122 for the second wicket and then Hassett and Miller made 109 for the fourth wicket, Miller making 55. Hassett's 115 was his ninth century in Test cricket. From 243 for four at lunch on the second day, Australia lost their remaining six wickets for six runs, Bedser finishing with seven for 55. The Australian scorecard is one of the more unbalanced in Test history - a century, two half centuries, two single figure scores, single figure extras, and six batsmen failing to score.\nEngland, apart from Leonard Hutton, with 43, struggled and Lindwall took five wickets for 57 runs. In Australia's second innings, only Morris, who made 60, was confident against Bedser, who took seven for 44 to have match figures of 14 for 99. Hutton was 60 not out in England's weather-interrupted reply.\nSecond Test at Lord's.\nHassett opened with Morris and made his second century of the series, though he retired hurt at 101. Harvey made 59, but Johnny Wardle removed the middle order batsmen before Davidson, with 76, coaxed 117 runs out of the last six wickets. Hutton and Tom Graveney put on 168 for the second wicket, and after Graveney was out for 78, Denis Compton (57) added a further 102 with Hutton, who scored 145. But England lost their last seven wickets between lunch and tea on the third day, and the first innings lead was only 26. Morris and Miller regained the initiative for Australia in a second wicket partnership of 165 and when Morris was out for 89 Miller went on to 109, with useful runs also from Hole (47) and Lindwall (50). Set 343 to win, England lost three wickets for 12 runs, and Willie Watson was missed before the end of the fourth day. On the last day, Watson battled to 109 and shared a fifth wicket stand of 163 with Trevor Bailey (71), which saved the match for England.\nThird Test at Old Trafford.\nMore than half the scheduled playing time was lost to rain. In an innings spread over three days, Harvey made 122 and Hole with 66 and de Courcy on his Test debut also made useful runs. England's innings was also made disjointed by rain, which prevented any play at all on the fourth day. Hutton top-scored with 66. With the match dead, Wardle, Bedser and Jim Laker took eight Australian second-innings wickets, with none of the batsmen reaching double figures.\nFourth Test at Headingley.\nOn a pitch affected by damp, England batted very cautiously, making just 142 for seven in five-and-a-half hours on the first day, Graveney top-scoring with 55. Lindwall took five for 54. Australia batted more enterprisingly, with Harvey making 71 and Hole 53 and were all out at the end of the second day with a lead of 99. Light rain prevented play for more than four hours on the third day, and across the Monday England batted doggedly, with Bill Edrich making 64, Compton 61 until he had to retire hurt, and Bailey 38 in more than four hours. In all, England's innings occupied nine hours and 40 minutes, and left the Australians 115 minutes in which to score 177. Despite 30s from Morris, Harvey and Hole, they finished 30 runs short. Bailey restricted the scoring by bowling wide of the leg stump.\nFifth Test at The Oval.\nThe series being undecided, six days were allowed and the match began, unusually for a Test in England, on a Saturday. Hassett won the toss for the fifth time. He made 53 and Harvey and Hole made 30s, but Lindwall top-scored with 62 and last five wickets more than doubled the score. Fred Trueman, in his only match of the series, took four wickets. Hutton scored 82, but at the end of the second day England, at 235 for seven, were still 40 behind. The lead was not gained until the last pair, Bailey and Bedser, were together; Bailey made 64. When Australia batted for the second time, Hutton turned very quickly to the Surrey spin-bowling pair, Laker and Tony Lock, and they took nine of the 10 wickets to fall, the other being a run-out. Lock finished with five for 45 and Laker four for 75. Australia's lack of a spinner – though Johnston bowled slows from one end – meant England got the 132 needed for victory easily, if slowly. The match was finished in mid-afternoon on the fourth day and the Ashes had been won.\n1953 Ashes Series averages.\nBatting averages.\nsource\nBowling averages.\nsource\nCeylon.\nThe Australians had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to England and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon (later Sri Lanka) national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1954–55",
        "text": "Len Hutton captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1954–55, playing as England against Australia in the 1954–55 Ashes series and as the MCC in other matches on the tour. It was the first time that an England team had toured Australia under a professional captain since the 1880s. After losing the First Test by an innings, they beat Australia 3–1 and retained the Ashes. The combination of Frank Tyson, Brian Statham, Trevor Bailey, Johnny Wardle and Bob Appleyard made it one of the strongest bowling sides to tour Australia, and it was the only team of any nationality to defeat Australia at home between 1932–33 and 1970–71.\nThe England touring team.\nManagement.\nThe tour was managed by Geoffrey Howard, the popular secretary of Lancashire County Cricket Club who had been a wicketkeeper-batsman for the Private Banks XI in 1926–36 and had played three games for Middlesex. He was in the RAF during the Second World War and once hit a century before lunch playing for their cricket team. Howard had managed the MCC tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1951–52, and on a later tour would smooth things over when some players tipped water over umpire Idris Begh in Pakistan in 1955–56. \"The 'Ger\" ran a happy ship and even played in a couple of non-first class matches. He had been given no funds by the MCC (he was meant to return a profit) and had to take out an overdraft from an Australian bank until he could pay his way with gate receipts. When Len Hutton was stricken with fibrositis at the start of the Third Test, it was Howard and Duckworth who convinced him to play. George Duckworth had been England's wicketkeeper in the 1920s, but now managed the team's baggage and travel arrangements. He \"was guide, philosopher and friend to all who had the sense to see the worth of his experience of cricket in Australia\" and liaised with the press corps. One innovation was the appointment of Harold Dalton as the team physiotherapist. Previously the players had used local masseurs.\nCaptain.\nThe selection of the MCC touring team was not without controversy. Len Hutton was the first professional England captain since Arthur Shrewsbury in 1876–77 other than as a temporary stop-gap. This break with tradition received much criticism from those who thought only a gentleman should hold this honour, but England had been heavily defeated by Australia in every series since the war, and even the West Indies in 1950. Hutton had been brought up in the hard school of Yorkshire cricket under George Hirst and Herbert Sutcliffe. Even so, he \"...was a tactical genius, whose assistance was often sought...\" by amateur captains, but in his day professionals were not trained as captains and the burden sat heavily on his shoulders.\nHe began well with a 3–0 victory over India in 1952 and regained the Ashes 1–0 in 1953. England pulled back from being 2–0 down to square a series in the West Indies in 1953–54 despite political interference, riots and dubious umpiring. England drew 1–1 with Pakistan in 1954, but Hutton was ill for two Tests and the Rev David Sheppard captained England. There was talk that the Sussex amateur should lead the MCC in Australia and New Zealand. Fortunately, wiser counsels prevailed and Hutton was confirmed as captain. Of the amateurs on tour Bill Edrich was an old comrade and had been a professional before the war, and the others – Reg Simpson, Trevor Bailey, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey – had been schoolboys when Hutton was making Test centuries. As a result, Hutton's right to the captaincy was not questioned, the team were happy to play under him and his conscientious vice-captain Peter May was particularly helpful. As a working class Yorkshireman he was not fully adept in social graces, and he gave his after-dinner speeches in \"Pudsey English\". When dealing with the press corps, Hutton used heavy silences and \"developed the art when it suited him of delivering with much gravity Delphic utterances which his hearers could interpret however they pleased\"\nHutton captained England in 23 Tests – of which he won 11, drew 8 and lost 4 – and proved to be one of the most successful captains in England's history. They never lost a series in which he was captain and England regained the Ashes from Lindsay Hassett's powerful 1953 Australians—the first such success in 19 years. He was fortunate in the quality of the young England players available in the 1950s, but he used them to the utmost effect. More than any other player he knew the strain of facing high-quality fast bowling and used his own fast bowlers ruthlessly. Hutton would often slow the over rates both to rest them in the Australian heat and to break the concentration of the batsmen, as he knew that strokemakers could be got out through frustration alone. These tactics did not endear him to the crowds, or the \"old guard\" back home who preferred the carefree attacking captaincy of the amateur, but they were very effective. The Yorkshireman also made bowling changes with great cunning, notably in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, and his ability to read a wicket during a match sometimes verged on second sight. Frank Tyson wrote that Hutton was \"pursued by his own personal demons. He will never be completely content until the series has been won and he has exorcised his two personal tormentors, Lindwall and Miller. Not for a moment does he relax his own bottled up intensity\". There have been more inspirational captains and those with more flair and imagination, but few matched Len Hutton for sheer bloody-minded determination to win. He retired from the game soon after the tour and was knighted for services to cricket in 1956.\nBatsmen.\nEngland had a strong batting line up: Len Hutton (averaging 56.67), Bill Edrich (40.00), Peter May (46.77), Colin Cowdrey (44.06), Denis Compton (50.06) and Trevor Bailey (29.74), with Tom Graveney (44.38) standing in for the injured Compton and out-of-form Edrich in the two Sydney Tests. Hutton was the holder of the then record Test score of 364 and had by far the best batting average of either team in 1950–51 (88.83) and 1953 (55.37). The main problem was finding a suitable opening partner once Cyril Washbrook (42.81) had retired. Reg Simpson (33.35) was the only other opener in the team and thought the job should be his. He had been on the sidelines for years, and had made 156 not out at Melbourne in the 1950–51 Ashes series when Australia was beaten for the first time in 12 years. Though chosen for the First Test he failed and did not find his form until late in the series. As a result, Hutton tried Bailey, Edrich and Graveney in the number two position. England's opening-partnership problem remained unsolved until the emergence of John Edrich and Geoffrey Boycott in the 1960s. With the strong Australian bowling on their home turf, runs were hard to come by and only the obstinate stonewaller \"Barnacle\" Bailey exceeded his career Test average in a low-scoring series (37.00 over 29.74). Keith Miller wrote \"I reckon he has saved more matches for England than anyone else since the war. His figures belie his worth to England. When a fielding side sees him coming in, a trough of deep depression immediately settles around the area\". Bill Edrich had been a Squadron Leader during the war and won the DFC for his part in the \"RAF's most audacious and dangerous low-level bombing raid\" on Cologne in 1941. Edrich had \"an immense relief that he survived\" becoming a bon viveur who lived for the day and a gutsy batsman who was \"almost indifferent to his own safety. No bowler is too fast to hook; no score too large to defy challenge.\" Vic Wilson was a strapping Yorkshire farmer who could hit the ball many a mile, but failed to come to terms with the Australian pitches. The baby-faced Colin Cowdrey, an Oxford undergraduate and the youngest member of the side, was a real find with his immaculate timing of the ball in the first of a record six tours of Australia. \"The 22-year-old had received news of his father's death at the start of the tour, but soldiered on, thanks to the advice and encouragement of his young teammate Peter May and father figure and captain Len Hutton\". Even so, Hutton made a small bet that Wilson would score more Test runs than Cowdrey on the tour Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 \"was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat\", and even batted at number seven on the tour. The team scored fewer Test runs than any England team in Australia for fifty years, but with such talent somebody usually got the vital runs and, except at Brisbane, England had the advantage.\nBowlers.\nLike Australia, England had a rich seam of bowling talent in the 1950s, so much so that they left behind fast bowler Fred Trueman (average 21.57), off-spinner Jim Laker (21.24) and slow left armer Tony Lock (25.58) who between them had taken 15 wickets in the Ashes-winning Fifth Test at the Kennington Oval in 1953. The most likely explanation is that these outspoken cricketers were regarded as 'difficult tourists' by the MCC and Hutton thought that \"Fiery Fred\" had yet to mature as a bowler. As in every series since the war it looked like the England bowling would rest on the broad shoulders of Alec Bedser (24.89)—in 1954 his 231 wickets was the greatest haul in Test history. His lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters had taken 30 wickets (at 16.06) on the 1950–51 tour and 39 wickets (at 17.48) in 1953. The unfortunate Bedser suffered from shingles, had seven catches dropped off him in the First Test, where he was hit for 1/131, was dropped and never got back into the side. He took to bowling to the Australian team in the nets and Keith Miller told him \"You're not too bad for a Test discard. If you want a game you can come over and play with us\". In the last four Tests Hutton relied on the formidable bowling attack of Frank Tyson (18.76), Brian Statham (24.84), Trevor Bailey (29.21), Johnny Wardle (20.39) and Bob Appleyard (17.87). While \"Typhoon\" Tyson is justly famed for simply blasting the opposition away, the nagging accuracy of Statham and Bailey and the increasing spin of Wardle and Appleyard all served to tie down and frustrate the Australian batsmen. In fact the spinners took wickets with a faster strike rate (1 wicket every 57 balls) and at a lower average (21.57) than the fast bowlers. Like Simpson the fast swing bowler Peter Loader (22.51) thought that he should have played in the Tests and was unlucky not to do so. Big Jim McConnon also had a bad tour, he was never really seen as an adequate alternative for Jim Laker, didn't find his form and was sent home early after a couple of painful injuries. Bill Edrich had opened the England bowling before the war, but rarely bowled in the 1950s. Len Hutton, Tom Graveney and Colin Cowdrey were part-time leg-spinners who were only really used in up-country games.\nFielding.\n\"Evans is a grand keeper. On this tour he proved that he is the outstanding keeper in the world today. I have never seen a better keeper than Tallon as he was in England in 1948...but that time has passed. Evans is now the world best. That's the way things go and the way we Australians are supposed to like it. Evans reminds me always of a fox terrier. He simply cannot stand still whilst on the cricket field. He moves with short, quick steps, dives, literally dives, at the ball when it is returned badly out of his reach...\"\nEngland's lamentable fielding at Brisbane – they dropped 14 catches – set a new low in Tests, made even worse by Australia's obvious superiority in this department. As a result, the tourists worked on this aspect of their game and improved through the tour, they could hardly do worse. In the First Test the exuberant Godfrey Evans – the outstanding wicket-keeper of the era – was suffering from heat-stroke, so debutant Keith Andrew was behind the stumps; he dropped Arthur Morris on 0 (he made 153) and didn't take any catches. Evans recovered and took over the rest of the series, taking a magnificent leg side catch off Tyson to dismiss Neil Harvey at Melbourne that precipitated Australia's collapse. Len Hutton (57 catches), Peter May (42), Bill Edrich (39) and Tom Graveney (80) were fine slip catchers, and Colin Cowdrey (120) proved to be an excellent one, but Hutton had fibrositis, Edrich and Bedser proved ungainly in the field and Denis Compton not only had his knee problem, but broke his hand on a billboard at Brisbane. As a result, the young bowlers had to exhaust themselves in the outfield instead of resting between spells. Vic Wilson never got to grips with the Australian pitches, but was a noted fielder and was used as a substitute.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article – 1954–55 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1954–55 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1954–55 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article – 1954–55 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1954–55 Ashes series\"\nCeylon.\nThe English team had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured England in the 1956 season to play a five-match Test series against England for The Ashes.\nEngland won the series 2–1 with 2 matches drawn and therefore retained The Ashes.\nThe series is most notable for off-spinner Jim Laker's 46 wickets (a record for a 5-Test series) at an average of 9.60, including all ten wickets in the second innings of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, the first time this had been achieved in Test cricket. In that Test, known as Laker's Match, Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs, still the best match bowling analysis achieved in both Test and all first-class cricket. The cartoonist Roy Ullyett summed up the summer with the picture of a dazed kangaroo in Australian strip and the ditty: \"Here lie the Ashes of '56, skittled by Laker for next to nix. Never forgotten, sorry you thought our wicket rotten\", signed \"Love from the groundstaff\". The second line refers to the Australian complaints that the grass had been shaved off the Old Trafford wicket to help the England spinners. Earlier in the summer, Laker had also taken ten wickets in an innings against the Australians in a tour match, playing for Surrey."

        "title": "English cricket team in Australia in 1958–59",
        "text": "Peter May captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1958–59, playing as England in the 1958–59 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. It was widely regarded as one of the strongest teams to depart English shores, comparable with the great teams of Johnny Douglas in 1911-12 and Percy Chapman in 1928-29. It had no obvious weaknesses, and yet it was beaten – and beaten badly. By the First Test the top batsmen had made runs, the Surrey trio of Loader, Laker and Lock had taken wickets, as had Lancashire's Brian Statham. South Australia, Victoria and an Australian XI had all been beaten – the last by the crushing margin of 345 runs – and all seemed rosy for Peter May's touring team. But in the Brisbane Test they lost by 8 wickets and the rest of the series failed to offer any hope of reversing their fortunes. The reasons for their failure were manifold; the captain was too defensive; injuries affected their best players; others were too young and inexperienced such as Arthur Milton, Raman Subba Row, Ted Dexter, Roy Swetman and John Mortimore, or at the end of their career; Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Willie Watson and Frank Tyson. Their morale was further bruised when faced with bowlers of dubious legality and unsympathetic umpires. Peter May was criticised for seeing his fiancée Virginia Gilligan, who was travelling with her uncle the Test Match commentator Arthur Gilligan. The press blamed the poor performance on the team's heavy drinking, bad behaviour and lack of pride – a foretaste the treatment losing teams would receive in the 1980s. It was not a happy tour by any means and it would take 12 years to recover The Ashes. As E.W. Swanton noted\n\"It was a tour which saw all sorts of perverse happenings – from an injury list that never stopped (and culminated in only 12 out of 18 being fit to fly to New Zealand), to the dis-satisfaction with umpiring and bowlers' actions that so undermined morale. From various causes England gave below their best...\"\nThe management.\nThe tour manager was Freddie Brown, the rugged ex-Northamptonshire and England captain. He had led the 1950–51 touring side, which had been dismissed as the weakest ever sent to Australia, and his refusal to accept defeat in the face of great odds had won him admiration from the Australian public. He had played his last Test in 1953 when England regained The Ashes after 19 years, when he was the only man in the team to have toured with Douglas Jardine in 1932–33 when England had last beaten Australia. Brown had a more robust and combative style than May and wanted to complain officially about what the English party perceived as the throwing actions of the Australian bowlers, which might have resulted in a Bodyline type crisis. May refused, and Brown's unofficial complaints were rebuffed by Sir Donald Bradman. Fred Trueman thought \"he was a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot\" Brown did not like Trueman either and threatened to send the Yorkshire fast bowler home, but May smoothed things over. The assistant-manager was Desmond Eagar, the captain of Hampshire in 1946–57, who built up the attacking team that would win the County Championship in 1961 and was a noted cricket historian. Like Brown, George Duckworth had toured with Jardine, and was now the scorer, baggage-master and general factotum. The physiotherapist or masseur was Desmond Montague, an experienced professional who would have a lot of work to do on the tour.\nThe captain.\nIn 1958 life looked good for Peter May of Charterhouse, Cambridge, Surrey and England; his county had been County Champions for seven years running, with May the captain for the last two seasons, and England had never been defeated under his leadership. Vice-captain on the triumphant tour of Australia in 1954-55 he had beaten South Africa 3–2 in 1955, considered by many to have been the most exciting Test series since the war, Australia 2–1 in 1956, the West Indies 3–0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4–0 in 1958. He was widely regarded as the best post-war batsman England produced, tall, strong and disciplined with a near-perfect technique, a straight bat and a complete range of strokes. His standards improved with the responsibilities of captaincy and his Test average as captain was 54.03. His greatest century was against the West Indies in 1957 when England followed on 288 runs behind at Edgbaston, he made 285 not out, the highest score by an England captain until Graham Gooch's 333 in 1990, adding 411 with Colin Cowdrey (154) – still an England record for any wicket – and destroyed the mesmerising hold the spinner Sonny Ramadhin had over English batsmen. In the low scoring Ashes series of 1956 he had made 453 runs (90.60) and was out only once for less than 50, when he made 43. Although himself a highly educated amateur and a gentleman he realised that the old class divisions in English cricket were breaking down and under Len Hutton's leadership the amateur and professional had merged. He enjoyed the complete loyalty of the team and the selectors and was ready to help his players and smooth down feathers. As a captain he was a strict team disciplinarian who expected high standards, he was ruthless when the occasion demanded, but could be inflexible and unimaginative and lacked the charisma of a natural leader. In 1958–59 he played too defensively and surrendered the initiative to readily to Benaud as he concentrated on saving runs instead of trying to get batsmen out. Faced with Meckiff's bowling in the disastrous First Test he declined to make an official complaint as it would appear unsporting and sour grapes. A more ruthless captain may have resolved this problem at the start of the series, even at the loss of Tony Lock, but that would have damaged Anglo-Australian cricketing relations. After the Australian tour May beat New Zealand 1-0, India 5-0 and led England to its first series victory in the West Indies 1-0. He lost 2-1 to the 1961 Ashes series and retired due to ill-health having been captain in a then record 41 Tests, Richie Benaud being the only man to defeat him in a Test series.\nThe opening batsmen.\nThe English bowling was obviously of great strength, but their batting was not far behind. The slightly built left-handed Peter Richardson looked set for a long career for England; he had a Test average of 46.20 at the start of the series and had made centuries against Australia, South Africa, the West Indies and New Zealand. At Johannesburg in 1956-57 he took 488 minutes to reach three figures, a new record for the slowest Test century. Despite this he was known for his ability to make runs against the tightest fielding and was known to be a good tourist, but despite making consistent runs in the state matches he failed in the series and never made another Test century. He had been the amateur captain of Worcestershire and wanted to become a professional player for Kent under Colin Cowdrey, but his old county refused to release him from his contract and he had to sit out the 1959 First Class cricket season while qualifying, and lost his England place. This situation could not have been comfortable for him and was considered to have affected his form in Australia. His opening partner was Arthur Milton, one of the two England players who was not a great name, but he had a Test average of 140.00 after making a century on debut against New Zealand at Headingley, when England lost only two wickets in the match and won by an innings. Milton was one of the last \"double internationals\", he played football for Arsenal, Bristol City and England. Raman Subba Row had transferred from Surrey to Northamptonshire in 1955 and made 300 against his old county in 1958, earning him a place on the tour. Unfortunately, just as he was needed he broke his thumb and didn't play in any of the Tests, but later made a 59 and 112 on his Ashes debut in the First Test at Edgbaston in 1961.\nThe middle order batsmen.\nThe England middle order was full of stroke-makers, but it was on the captain Peter May and vice-captain Colin Cowdrey that the real burden lay. Unlike the others they were a permanent fixture in the team and it was generally felt that if they failed then so did the batting. May was the leading England runmaker in 1954–55, 1956 and 1958–59, making runs where others could not. Cowdrey had made his first and best Test century in 1954–55, 102 in an innings of 191 and could send the ball to the boundary with the most fleeting touch of the bat. Like Cowdrey Tom Graveney entertained the crowds with the \"sunshine of his style\", but was unfairly seen as a fair weather man who only succeeded when the going was good. He came a poor third to May and Cowdrey in the Test batting averages, but was the most consistent batsmen on the tour. If ever a man was famous for a single innings it was Willie Watson when he batted for 346 minutes to save the England at Lord's in 1953 after Australia had reduced them to 12/3. The left-handed strokemaker failed to gain a regular place in the Test team, but was recalled after he moved to Leicestershire as captain in 1957 and had his best season in 1958. He injured his knee getting out of a deckchair on the \"Iberia\" and missed the first two months of the tour, thus reducing the touring team to 15. When he did get to play he was out of practice and out of form. Ted Dexter was flown in from Paris (where his wife worked as a model) in the middle of the tour, having been unlucky to not be picked in the first place If he had been part of the original team he would have acclimatised, but although he did well in the tour matches he failed in the Tests, but made 141 in New Zealand. After an indifferent summer against India he was taken the Caribbean in 1959-60 where \"Lord Ted\" made his name by thrashing the fast bowlers with his ferocious driving. Trevor Bailey was on his third tour down under, but his painfully slow scoring was blamed for paralysing the England batting. This is unjust as the stonewalling of \"Barnacle Bailey\" had been previously seen as the backbone of the lower border and was unlikely to change his style when promoted to open the innings.\nThe fast bowlers.\nEngland took four fast bowlers; Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham and Peter Loader, which Swanton thought was one too many, and the all-rounders Trevor Bailey and Ted Dexter. Tyson had been the decisive force in England's 3–1 victory on the previous tour, but had been dogged by a heel injury since 1955 and had played only intermittently for England ever since. Though still capable of blazing his way through many First Class cricket teams, Tyson struggled on the slow, plumb wickets used in the Tests. The outspoken Yorkshireman Fred Trueman called himself \"The Best Bloody English Fast Bowler That Ever Drew Bloody Breath\" and with considerable justification. He possessed a text-book side-on action which generated great pace and menacing late swing which was coupled with the fitness and stamina to bowl a thousand overs a season. On this tour he was strangely subdued, he was overbowled at the start of the injury-struck tour and took just 9 wickets (30.66) in the last three Tests, but took 28 wickets (19.54) in his other matches. Brian Statham was the \"straight man\" of the England fast bowling attack, running up the hill and into the wind while Tyson and Trueman let rip from the other end. He maintained a nagging line and length, but \"George\" was regarded as an unlucky bowler, so many times did he beat the batsman only to see the ball miss the stumps by the thinnest of margins. He lived by two mottos, the first \"bowling in matches keeps me fit for bowling\" preferring a quiet cigarette to physical training or net practise. The second was \"if they miss, I hit\", never more aptly demonstrated than in the match against Victoria when he took 7/47 – six bowled and one l.b.w. He was one of the few England players to have a successful tour with 12 wickets (23.83) despite missing the Fifth Test along with Peter Loader due to a car crash. Loader had been in and out of the England team and had toured Australia in 1954–55 without playing in any of the Tests. A fast-medium swing bowler with a wide range of pace and a nasty bouncer he took the first post war Test hat-trick in his 6/36 against the West Indies at Headingley in 1957. He bowled consistently well and took 26 wickets (19.50) on the tour, but only 7 wickets (27.57) in what was to be his last Test series. Along with Tyson, Laker and Loader Trevor Bailey was on his final tour, but did not improve his reputation. A fast-medium swing bowler whose grudging accuracy mirrored his famously negative batting he could be very dangerous in the right conditions, taking 7/34 in 1953-54 and 7/44 in 1957 against the West Indies, but was mostly used for containment and failed on the tour. Ted Dexter was a late reinforcement and a capable swing bowler, but did not bowl in the Tests.\nThe spin bowlers.\nOriginally 17 players where chosen for the tour, but this was rapidly reduced to 16 when Johnny Wardle was sacked by Yorkshire. He responded with a series of newspaper articles highly critical of Headingley politics and was de-selected for the tour, though he went to Australia as a journalist. Wardle was a real loss, a slow left arm bowler who could bowl Chinamen and reverse googlies and had been lethal in Australia and New Zealand in 1954–55 and South Africa in 1956-57. Even worse he was not replaced and the MCC travelled with only 16 men and two spinners, Laker and Lock. In 1956 Jim Laker had taken 46 wickets (9.60) against the Australians with his ferocious off-spin, still a record for an Ashes series. For Surrey he took 10/88 and 2/42 against the tourists, but at Old Trafford he took 9/37 and 10/53, a record for all First Class cricket. His Surrey \"spin twin\" was Tony Lock, a slow left arm bowler with a dangerous faster ball. He took only 15 wickets (22.46) wickets against Australia in 1956, but 34 wickets (7.47) against New Zealand in 1958. The selectors had had doubts about their effectiveness overseas and neither had been taken in 1954–55, but Laker would top the England Test and tour bowling averages. Lock would have a chequered tour; taking only 5 wickets (75.20) in the Tests, but 28 wickets (21.32) in the other First Class games. Ironically his faster ball that became embroiled him in the throwing controversy proved to be ineffective in the Tests. In the 1962–63 tour Lock would not be taken, but joined Western Australia and was instrumental in their defeat of the MCC and their rise in Sheffield Shield cricket. Belatedly the MCC sent John Mortimore to Australia by plane, an off-spinning all-rounder who was later kept out of the England team by the similar, but superior, skills of Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus.\nThe wicket-keepers and fielders.\nThe great England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans was on his fourth tour of Australia, having visited before in 1946–47, 1950–51 and 1954–55. He was chosen in part for his batting, having made centuries against the West Indies and India, but his loud and enthusiastic wicketkeeping was a joy to watch and considered by far the best in the world. When he returned to England in 1959 he missed three stumpings in fifteen minutes against India and retired from Test cricket as he no longer met his own exacting standards, but his Test record number of 173 catches and 46 stumpings remained unbeaten for eighteen years. The Marylebone Cricket Club preferred to rotate their reserve wicket-keepers and in 1958–59 it was the turn of the reserve Surrey keeper Roy Swetman. He was by far the shortest man in the team and looked only 17, but was in fact 25. Although a good man behind the stumps and a decent lower order batsman he was not Evans and lost his England place in 1960. In 1956 England had out-fielded and out-caught Australia and they were still a strong fielding team. Colin Cowdrey would be the first slip fielder to take 100 Test catches, Peter May and Tom Graveney were good slips and Ted Dexter an athletic cover. Fred Trueman was a good close field and Tony Lock was considered the greatest backward short leg in the world and one of the safest pair of hands in cricket. Peter Richardson, Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey were good all round fielders, though the latter two were slowing down at the end of their careers.\nInjuries.\nThe MCC team suffered from a long list of injuries that affected their ability to contest the Ashes series, particularly as they only had a 16-man squad because Johnny Wardle was not replaced when he was dropped. When they Australian tour ended only 12 men were fit enough to proceed to the following tour in New Zealand, Bailey, Evans, Laker, Loader, Milton and Statham returning to England instead.\nThe England touring squad.\nBelow are the Test statistics of the England squad. As was the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if their initials were used at all.\nFirst Test - Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nThird Test - Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test - Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nCeylon.\nThe English team had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1961",
        "text": "The 1961 Australian cricket tour of England began with a three-day match versus Worcestershire at the County Ground, New Road, Worcester on Saturday 29 April, play continuing on Monday 1 May and Tuesday 2 May. This match was rain-affected and ended in a draw. The tour ended at Trinity College Park, Dublin on 19 September when the Australians completed a 282 run victory in a two-day match versus Ireland.\nIn the first innings of the tour match against Cambridge University in mid-May, the Australians scored 449-3d - still the lowest first-class innings to feature four individual centuries.\nThe Australian tour party consisted of these players: R Benaud (captain), R N Harvey (vice-captain), A T W Grout (wicket-keeper), B N Jarman (wicket-keeper), W M Lawry, N C O'Neill, P J P Burge, C C McDonald, B C Booth, R B Simpson, K D Mackay, A K Davidson, F M Misson, G D McKenzie, R A Gaunt, I W Quick, L F Kline.\nSeries overview.\nThe main business of the tour was a five-Test series versus England. The matches were played at Edgbaston, Lord's, Headingley, Old Trafford and The Oval. Australia won the series 2–1 to retain The Ashes.\nTest series summary.\n\"No captain of my time has impressed me more than Richie Benaud. Richie had the gift of making you feel you were a better player than you really were. He made his players believe they could win, even when the cause looked utterly hopeless. Nothing illustrated more clearly Richie's adroit handling of men than his leadership of the 1961 Australian team which came to Britain. They should never have won the rubber with those players, but Richie instilled into them his belief in themselves - this attitude that \"there is nothing we cannot achieve if we set our minds to it\".\"\nFifth Test.\nFive years after their disastrous showing against Jim Laker, the Australians returned to the top of the international tree by retaining the Ashes in England only months after their exciting victory over the West Indies in the memorable Tied test series of 1960-1961 played \"Down Under\".\nThe 1961 series was a personal triumph for skipper Richie Benaud, whose match-winning bowling and astute leadership in the fourth Test at Old Trafford proved to be the decisive factor in the series. With the series square, England needed 256 to win and were expected to get them, but Benaud, by bowling his leg breaks round the wicket into some rough created by footmarks, took 6–70 to secure an Australian victory by 54 runs. The key moment came when he bowled the England captain Peter May behind his legs for a duck. The bemused May had to be told by Aussie keeper Wally Grout that he had been bowled.\nAustralia won the series by drawing the final Test at The Oval and it confirmed a supremacy over England that would endure throughout the decade.\nEngland in 1961 was heavily reliant on the fast bowling of Fred Trueman, then at his peak. It was his brilliant performance at Headingley, where he took 11 wickets in the match, that earned England its only win in the series.\nPeter May had missed the start of the series and he relinquished the captaincy at the end of the summer, telling the selectors he did not wish to be considered for any more overseas tours. At the age of 32, he hoped to continue playing for Surrey but, as it turned out, he was lost to the game. He was one of the last amateur cricketers and he decided to make his living in the City of London.\nThe Tests in detail.\nAfter the first match was drawn, Australia had their traditional victory at Lord's (England not having defeated them there since 1934), by 5 wickets on a lively pitch. Davidson did the damage in the first England innings and McKenzie in the second. Lawry's 130 in Australia's first innings, when nobody else on either side made more than 66 in either innings, was crucial.\nEngland won by 8 wickets at Headingley, Australia collapsing in their second innings from 99–2 to 120 all out, thanks to Trueman's devastating spell of off-cutters. He finished with figures of 6-30, having taken 5–58 in the first innings.\nThe Fourth Test at Old Trafford proved decisive. It was won by Australia by 54 runs. The last day was very exciting, seeing many turns of fortune. England had managed a first innings lead of 177. Australia's second innings had reached 331–6 at the close of the fourth day, a lead of 154. On the final morning, David Allen took 3 wickets quickly, reducing Australia to 334–9, and the game seemed won by England. But Davidson then took the attack to the bowlers, hitting Allen for 20 in an over, and with help from McKenzie added 98 for the last wicket. England needed 256 to win at 67 runs an hour. Ted Dexter, well supported by Raman Subba Row, scored 76 in 84 minutes and took England to 150–1, and strong favourites to win. But Benaud went round the wicket and aimed at the bowlers' footmarks, and caused a collapse. He finished with 6-70, and Australia won with 20 minutes to spare, thereby retaining The Ashes.\nThe final Test was drawn, after Australia had taken a big first innings lead.\nCeylon.\nThe Australians had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to England and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status."

        "text": "Royal Melbourne Golf Club is a 36-hole golf club in Australia, located in Black Rock, Victoria, a suburb in southeastern Melbourne. Its West and East courses are respectively ranked number 1 and 6 in Australia. The West course is ranked in the top-five courses in the world. Founded in 1891, it is Australia's oldest extant and continually existing golf club. Unlike many metropolitan golf venues, The Royal Melbourne Golf Club has a capacity for 15,000 spectators.\nRoyal Melbourne has hosted numerous national and international events. Its 16 Australian Opens are surpassed by only the 17 hosted by The Australian Golf Club. It hosted the 1959 Canada Cup (now Mission Hills World Cup), and the 1972 World Cup. Royal Melbourne hosted the Bicentennial Classic, a tournament to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. It was selected by the PGA Tour to hold the Presidents Cup, for the first time outside the United States, in December 1998. The match was convincingly won by the International team, captained by Peter Thomson, an honorary member of Royal Melbourne. The course hosted the Presidents Cup again in November 2011, won by the United States and December 2019. It was the site of the Women's Australian Open for the first time in February 2012, now an LPGA Tour event, and it returned three years later in 2015.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1891 as the Melbourne Golf Club (\"Royal\" prefix given in 1895), the founding president was politician Sir James MacBain, and the founding captain was businessman John Munro Bruce (father of Australian prime minister Stanley Bruce). The principal founding members included P.K. (Patrick Kinney) McCaughan, a New Zealand pastoralist, parliamentarian, businessman and developer and proprietor of the Old Rialto Hotel building in Collins Street.\nThe club had to give up its original site at Caulfield, much nearer the city centre, because of increasing urbanization. A new links, the \"West course\", was started at Sandringham in 1898.\nIt planned a move to its present location in the mid-1920s. Royal Melbourne's two current courses are known as the \"West\" and \"East\" courses. The West course was designed under the strict standards of famous course architect Alister MacKenzie. He visited the eventual site, located on the renowned Melbourne Sandbelt, south of the city, in 1926. The actual building of the West course was overseen by the famed Australian golfer Alex Russell, as well as the head greenkeeper Mick Morcom; it was completed for play in 1931. The East course was designed by Russell, and was completed in 1932.\nFeatures.\nA combination comprising 18 holes from both the East and West courses that are limited to the main property (\"paddock\") is known as the \"Composite\" course. There have been 21 holes used in the history of the \"Composite\" course, from 1959 to 2011, depending on the event being held.\nThe East course is less known compared to its world-renowned sister course, but it has still been held in very high regard since its completion. The West course has several holes that are celebrated internationally, but they are not long compared to the current standards for championship par 4s and 5s. The course is strictly landlocked by existing boundaries, which is why these holes have not been greatly extended in recent decades. Significant restoration of the West course (and East course Composite holes), as well as minor lengthening, took place leading up to the 2011 Presidents Cup. As a secondary measure to lengthening, fairway grasses were changed to Legend Couch. This was in order to restrict the progress of the golf ball along the ground. However the Legend Couch was ultimately considered to be an inferior playing surface and has been oversown with Wintergreen Couch."

France followed this with a goalless draw against Uruguay, in a match in which their star striker Thierry Henry was sent off, before rounding out the group with another defeat to Denmark. Senegal's other two matches finished as draws, including a well-earned point against Denmark and a bad-tempered game against Uruguay, in which 12 players were booked.\nDenmark started the group well, beating Uruguay in Ulsan, before a late Senegalese equaliser in Daegu prevented them from qualifying for the round of 16 with a match to spare. Instead, they were forced to play France, knowing that a draw would see them through to the next round. They won 2–0 and finished top of the group thanks to Senegal's draw with Uruguay.\nDark horses Uruguay never really got going, with their high point being a goalless draw with a sub-par French side.

        "title": "Jesse Hawley (American football)",
        "text": "Jesse Barnum Hawley Jr. (March 25, 1887 – March 21, 1946) was an American football coach, inventor, and president of Hawley Products Company. He served as the head coach at the University of Iowa from 1910 to 1915 and at Dartmouth College from 1923 to 1928, compiling a career college football record of 63–28–1. Hawley was the tenth head coach in Iowa football history and led Dartmouth to a national championship in 1925. In 1935, Hawley invented a tropical shaped, pressed fiber sun helmet that was adopted in 1940 by the United States military. Approximately 250,000 of Hawley's military sun helmets were produced during World War II by Hawley Products Company and the International Hat Company.\nCoaching career.\nIowa.\nHawley was hired by the University of Iowa as its tenth head football coach in 1910. Iowa had not won the conference title in a decade, and Hawkeye fans were hoping Hawley could turn Iowa's fortunes around. School officials also hired Nelson A. Kellogg in 1910 to be Iowa's athletic director. Supervision of intercollegiate athletics at Iowa had, since 1900, also been the responsibility of the head coach. Hawley, however, could focus solely on coaching the football team.\nHawley's Hawkeyes had a 5–2 record in 1910. The most notable game that season was a loss to Missouri. Before traveling to Columbia for the game, Hawley was warned not to take Archie Alexander, Iowa's talented black tackle, along for the game. Fearing troubles similar to what Frank Holbrook, Iowa's first black football player, encountered in a game against Missouri in 1896, Hawley agreed to leave Alexander behind. When the Iowa team arrived in Columbia, a mob of local townspeople met the team to ensure that Alexander was not with them. In view of the racial incidents as well as the unsportsmanlike treatment Hawkeye players received during the game, Hawley vowed that Iowa would never again play Missouri in football as long as he was the coach. It has been longer than that. The two neighboring state universities did not meet again until the Insight Bowl in 2010.\nA 1–3 start was cause for concern in 1911, but Iowa finished the year strong and had a solid 4–3 record in 1912. The biggest win of the 1912 season was a 20–7 victory over Iowa State, the last Iowa State team to win a conference title. It was also the final loss in the coaching career of Clyde Williams, a former Iowa football star.\nHawley was poised to field his best Iowa team in 1913. The 1913 Hawkeyes had a 5–2 record and easily led the nation in scoring. Only a loss to Chicago kept Iowa from the Western Conference title. However, Iowa responded the following week with a 78–6 victory over Northwestern, the team that cost Iowa a share of the Western Conference title in 1910. Iowa's 78 points is the most ever surrendered by a Northwestern team, and the 72-point loss is the second largest defeat in Northwestern school history. The Hawkeyes also defeated Cornell College, 76–0, and Indiana, 60–0. Iowa's 45–7 win over Iowa State was the most lopsided in series history at the time and was Iowa's first Homecoming win.\nIowa defeated Northern Iowa, 95–0, to open the 1914 season under Hawley. It is the largest margin of victory in Iowa history and easily Northern Iowa's biggest loss. However, many fans were critical of Iowa's win, stating that winning 95–0 did little to prepare Iowa for the rest of the season. They may have been correct; Iowa lost consecutive conference games by 7–0 scores to knock the Hawkeyes from the conference race yet again.\nIowa started 3–0 in 1915, but Iowa lost the final four games of the season, and criticism of Hawley mounted. Specifically, eleven of the best players in the Western Conference were Iowans playing for other member schools. Undefeated Minnesota started four Iowans, Chicago and Northwestern each started three, and the star of the 1915 Wisconsin team was an Iowan as well. Five Iowans earned all-conference honors in 1915, and only one played for Iowa. In addition, Hawley only coached and lived in Iowa City during the season, and many Hawkeye fans felt the program needed a \"full-time\" coach. As a result, Hawley resigned after the 1915 season.\nHawley had a 24–18 record at Iowa. He was a quiet, reserved coach who believed in fundamentals and attention to detail. He was also a brilliant offensive coach who guided Iowa to some of the most lopsided wins in school history.\nDartmouth.\nWhen Hawley resigned at Iowa, he stated that he wanted to spend more time with his investment business. He was a successful investor and businessman before he arrived at Iowa. Hawley, a Dartmouth College graduate, returned to Hanover and continued his business after leaving Iowa in 1915.\nIn 1923, Dartmouth's football team needed a head coach, and Hawley took the job and stayed for six years. Successful in private enterprise, he volunteered his services and coached his alma mater for free.\nUnder Hawley, Dartmouth went 22 games without a loss from 1923 to 1926. Hawley reached the pinnacle of success in 1925, when he led Dartmouth to an undefeated 8–0 season, for which Dartmouth claims the national championship. Other than two national titles claimed by Princeton in the 1930s under Fritz Crisler, the 1925 Dartmouth national title is the last claimed by an Ivy League school."

        "title": "Skeleton clock",
        "text": "A skeleton clock is any clock or wristwatch, though typically mechanical in nature, in which the parts that usually conceal the inner workings of the mechanism have been removed or significantly modified so as to display these inner parts.\nIt is considered to be a showcase design and intentionally exposes to plain view the various gears, wheels and springs within the movement itself. There is no official definition of a skeleton clock \"per se\", but a major portion of the main parts of the timepiece should be openly visible from the front of the clock and most often from the back as well in order for it to be considered and accepted as a skeleton clock. The parts most commonly showcased by a skeleton design are those exhibiting either the most movement or the most attractive design. These may include, but are not limited to the escapement, balance wheel and balance spring, mainspring, and tourbillon. Generally there is either no dial present in a skeleton clock, the dial is clear, or it has been limited to a ring around the edge of the case to provide a mounting surface for the hour markers. In the case of skeleton wristwatches, the back will usually be made of sapphire crystal or another clear material that affords easy examination of the parts protected within both from the front and from behind.\nIn addition, several authors have published construction manuals on skeleton clocks in clockmaking and model engineering journals in the UK and USA, several of which (UK) have ceased operations. However, the best known of these authors had the manuals reprinted in comb bound format and these are still available (2012). John Wilding in the UK wrote manuals on Large Wheel, Elegant Scroll Frame, Chrystal Wheel and Scissors. Bill Smith in the US wrote on Lyre, Grasshopper and Epicyclic skeleton clocks.\nThe Nomenclature for Skeleton clocks is somewhat different from for cased clocks, for example, part of the brass framework of a tall clock is called a plate, for skeletons, a frame.\nFrames of British skeleton clocks are listed by Roberts: Rafter (Including inverted “Y” frame), Gothic, Scroll (including lyre), Floral (ivy leaf and arabesque) and Architectural.\nThe photos are of some relatively simple commercial skeleton clocks with architectural frames, specifically of cathedrals in Great Britain: Litchfield and York Minster. The last is based on the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England. Maker is unknown, all have passing strike.\nFrance: Rafter (especially inverted “Y” a typical French design), Glass and Keyhole (Roberts’ term) as well as ornate designs.\nThe Escapement of a skeleton clock is typically different from one used in a tall case, mantle and wall clock. In Great Britain, anchor (recoil), dead beat, balance wheel and tic tac. In France, pinwheel, coup perdu, (both dead beat), crossbeat or variant of Dutretre’s escapement.\nThe motive power is typically with a spring and, in Britain Fusee, or, in France, a Going Barrel although weight-driven clocks were made in these small sizes with durations up to a month usually with two weights wound around the same barrel. British clocks sometimes used a Remontoire to power the strike. Tall case clocks most often had a time and strike train, later a chime train was added. A skeleton clock would utilize a passing strike that struck just once on the hour.\nNowadays the term skeleton clock is also used to describe modern skeleton clocks for wall. Unlike the 18th century skeleton clocks most of those contemporary timepieces are powered by the battery-operated quartz mechanism. The quartz movement used is a low cost, mass produced, plastic mechanism of no decorative value. It is disguised within the clock’s body therefore skeleton design is expressed in the open form of the clock face. Modern skeleton wall clocks have no visible back-plate. The wall background can be seen between the numbers or framework. Majority of the timepieces have minimalist design that can be easily manufactured on a large scale. This makes them inexpensive and popular. Higher valued timepieces with artistic value are usually handmade of wood or wrought iron."

        "text": "Artis Wayne Cooper (November 16, 1956 – April 11, 2022) was an American professional basketball player who played fourteen seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Coop\", he played for the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Portland Trail Blazers, and Denver Nuggets from 1978 to 1992. He was the Denver Nuggets’ all-time leader in blocks when he left the franchise in 1989. After his playing career ended, he worked as an executive with the Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings.\nEarly life.\nCooper was born in Milan, Georgia, on November 16, 1956. He attended Telfair County High School in his home county. He then studied at University of New Orleans (UNO) after being scouted by its associate coach, Don Smith, who described Cooper as a \"tall, skinny kid who could really shoot\". He played basketball for the New Orleans Privateers from 1974 and 1978. As a sophomore, he averaged 12.1 points per game (PPG) and a team-leading 9.4 rebounds per game (RPG), to go along with a .504 field goal percentage and a .723 free throw percentage. He then bettered his PPG to 13.2 and RPG to 10.1 the following year. During his senior year in 1977–78, Cooper recorded 18.1 PPG and 12.7 RPG as the Privateers won the Sun Belt tournament championship. He also established school records of most consecutive games with double-digit rebounding totals (13) and most consecutive games with a double-double (11) that year. Cooper received two All-Sun Belt selections during his college career and was honored as Sun Belt Player of the Year as a senior. He was selected in the 2nd round of the 1978 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.\nCareer.\nCooper made his NBA debut on October 14, 1978, scoring two points to go along with two rebounds against the . He played 65 games during his rookie season, averaging 4.6 PPG. After improving his PPG to 11.0 in the 1979–80 season and finishing ninth in offensive rebound percentage (12.1) in the NBA, he was traded to the Utah Jazz on September 11, 1980, in exchange for Bernard King. He was traded again less than a year later to the Dallas Mavericks, together with Allan Bristow, for Bill Robinzine. Cooper was subsequently traded for the third time in three seasons on June 28, 1982, to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Kelvin Ransey.\nIn the 1983 NBA playoffs, his first playoff appearance, Cooper played a key role in the Trail Blazers sweeping the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round by averaging 12 points, 10 rebounds, and 2 blocks a game in the series. However, the Trail Blazers ultimately lost in the semifinals to the Los Angeles Lakers. He was eventually traded with Fat Lever and Calvin Natt to the Denver Nuggets on June 7, 1984, in exchange for Kiki VanDeWeghe. In his first season with the franchise, Cooper recorded the second-highest block percentage (5.4) in the NBA behind Mark Eaton, as well as fourth-most blocks (197) and fourth-highest blocks per game (2.5).\nDuring the 1985–86 season – arguably Cooper's best season as a professional – he started 78 games for the Nuggets and averaged 13.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game. He finished third in the league in block percentage (5.9), fourth in blocks (227), and fourth in blocks per game. He also committed the third-highest number of personal fouls (315). Also that season, on December 11, 1985, he blocked a then-career-high 9 shots in a 134–95 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. He subsequently bettered that mark on December 30, 1988, when he blocked 10 shots in a 109–83 over the Miami Heat. He had the third-highest block percentage (6.4), sixth-most blocks (211), seventh-highest blocks per game (2.7), and tenth-highest total rebound percentage (17.1) in the league in 1988–89. Cooper became an unrestricted free agent at the end of that season, whereupon he returned to the Trail Blazers. He later appeared in the 1990 NBA Finals and 1992 NBA Finals, both with the Trail Blazers. The franchise lost to the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls, respectively. Throughout his NBA career, Cooper played in 984 games and scored a total of 7,777 points in the regular season.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring as a player at the end of the 1991–92 season, Cooper remained with the Trail Blazers and worked in its front office for two years. He subsequently became an assistant coach and director of basketball services of the Sacramento Kings in 1994. Two years later, he was promoted to vice president of basketball operations and served in that capacity until 2013.\nCooper was part of the inaugural class inducted into the University of New Orleans Hall of Fame in 1988. Four years later, he was enshrined in the Louisiana Association of Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame. He was named to the Sun Belt Conference's All-Time Men's Basketball Team in 1995. He was later inducted into the Greater New Orleans Sports Foundation Hall of Fame in 2000. Prior to the 2019–20 season, Cooper finished runner-up in voting by a panel of New Orleans basketball experts to determine the greatest basketball player in Privateers history. At the time of his death, he was ranked second all-time at UNO in double-doubles (44), third in career rebounds (920), and fifteenth in career points (1,209).\nPersonal life.\nCooper was married to Denise until his death. They had three daughters together.\nCooper died on April 11, 2022. He was 65, and suffered from kidney disease prior to his death."

        "title": "Strings (tennis)",
        "text": "In tennis, the strings are the part of a tennis racquet which make contact with the ball. The strings form a woven network inside the head (or \"hoop\") of the racquet. Strings have been made with a variety of materials and possess varying properties that have been measured, such as dynamic stiffness, tension retention, thickness (gauge), string texture (shape of the string), and rebound efficiency.\nComposition.\nThe material used in tennis string can significantly affect a player's performance, and even health. Several materials are used to make tennis strings. They vary in terms of elasticity, durability, rebound efficiency, tension holding capability, and manufacturing cost, among other considerations.\nNatural gut.\nAnimal intestine is the most resilient material used to make tennis strings. It has better tension retention than any other material, and also is softer than any other material used for tennis strings. It provides the most energy return, meaning it is the most efficient string. It remains soft at high tensions while other materials tend to stiffen dramatically. This allows gut string to enable players to string rather tightly to improve ball control without losing much rebound efficiency (power) and without greatly increasing impact shock, which can hurt the elbow and other joints.\nIts principal drawbacks are much higher cost to manufacture and purchase than other materials, weakness to shear stresses from off-center hits (typical of beginning players), variable quality control depending upon the brand, batch, age, storage conditions, and grade, difficulty of stringing due to its delicacy, and poor durability when wetted with water. Natural gut is very sensitive to different types of weather and those players who use it normally carry several different racquets with different tensions to compensate for this. Some players, particularly those who hit flat shots and hit the sweet spot consistently, find high-quality gut to be more durable than many other types of strings due to its outstanding tension retention. This may help to offset the high initial cost. The use of a dense string pattern also generally improves the longevity of natural gut.\nNatural gut is produced by drying fibers extracted from a part of the cow intestine called the serous membrane, or serosa, which contains collagen designed to withstand the stretching and contraction of the intestine. It is this elasticity that makes the fibers useful for tennis string. Sheep intestines have also been used for racquet strings in the past.\n A general name for this material is catgut.\nThe first natural gut tennis string was rumored to be manufactured in 1875 by Pierre Babolat, who would launch the VS brand of gut fifty years later. Natural gut is usually offered in coated form, to reduce its tendency to unravel, particularly when humid or wet.\nEven though handles were used after gloves in “Jeu de Paume,” the first prototype of the modern racket used today was created in Italy in 1583. The first rackets were made of wood and had strings made of gut at this time. The rackets had a slightly different shape than are used today; however, they are the first semblance of a racket being used for tennis. The strings utilized in these rackets were similar to strings that had been used in instruments previously. \nSynthetic gut.\nSynthetic gut is nylon, nearly always composed of a single filament. It is a very inexpensive string to manufacture and is generally the least expensive string to purchase.\nSmall changes from pure nylon are usually found in strings sold as \"synthetic gut\". Textured coatings, colorants and the addition of a small amount of Kevlar are the most common changes. Some manufacturers, such as Gosen, label nylon strings with words like \"sheep\", as in sheep intestine, although such strings contain no gut.\nSynthetic gut, as it is used for mono-filament nylon strings, is now a misnomer, as the creation of multi-filament strings has provided players with a better approximation of natural gut's performance. Modern \"synthetic gut\" is actually a multi-filament string that holds its tension extremely well and which has a dynamic stiffness profile that is closest to natural gut, although the industry continues to apply the term to mono-filament nylon strings.\nMulti-filament, or \"multi\".\nMulti-filament strings, known commonly as \"multis\" are strings that have more than one filament. They are most commonly made of many filaments of nylon, but can incorporate other materials such as polyurethane, Zyex, Vectran, Kevlar, and other materials. Multi-filament strings offer better elasticity than single filament strings, but usually inferior durability. No multi-filament string holds its tension as well as natural gut, and none of them is as soft.\nHowever, in comparison to mono-filament \"synthetic gut\", multi-filament strings can offer a much closer approximation of natural gut's performance. The softest multi-filament strings can be made with Zyex and polyolefin, although some of the softest of these strings are no longer on the market.\nNylon.\nNylon is the most popular string material for amateur players due to its low cost and the improvement in elasticity offered by multi-filament strings. Wear-resistant coatings for nylon strings are common, especially with multi-filament strings, because the outer filaments tend to break first as the racquet is used.\nPolyester.\nPolyester is a stiff and durable string material, originally intended for use by frequent string breakers. It took time for this string material to become popular, primarily due to its poor tension holding capability. However, players feel they are able to apply more topspin to balls while maintaining control with polyester strings.\nPolyester revolutionized professional tennis when a then little known Belgian string maker Luxilon supplied Gustavo Kuerten in 1997, who went on to win that year's French Open. Since then, polyester's support for heavy topspin in particular has made it the most popular string material in the professional tennis tour. The increased topspin due to polyester strings has been verified with controlled experiments today. The exact cause for the increased spin is not known but there is strong evidence that the low friction between strings is a factor.\nKevlar.\nKevlar is the stiffest, most durable synthetic string available, and is thus extremely hard to break. Although it is one of the best strings in terms of tension holding capability (next to natural gut), it is the most dangerous string when it comes to developing tennis elbow. Kevlar is often strung with another string, such as nylon), in order to combine both strings' qualities, as Kevlar by itself feels too stiff for many tennis players, especially when combined with a stiff racquet. Some advocate using a very thin gauge Kevlar for increasing comfort, but even in the thinnest gauge it is a stiff string. Another strategy to increase comfort and improve rebound efficiency is to string Kevlar at a low tension.\nVectran.\nVectran is the second-most stiff and durable of string types. It is perhaps the least commonly used contemporary string material. It is usually added to nylon string to increase nylon's durability and stiffness, as with Kevlar. Yonex, for instance, offers two badminton strings, made primarily from nylon, which have Vectran strands. However, the Ashaway company offers a braided Vectran tennis string.\nZyex.\nZyex string offers more rebound efficiency, i.e. gut-like dynamic stiffness, than other synthetic strings, particularly when strung at low tensions. This gives it playability that is more similar to natural gut than, arguably, other synthetic materials. It also has low overall stiffness. The ProKennex IQ Element Z string, for instance, has the lowest stiffness of any synthetic string yet tested. The drawback of Zyex is that the outer wrapping materials in Zyex tennis string tend to be much less durable than the Zyex filaments inside the string and do not bond with them. This can lead to the outer wrapping wearing away, leaving the inner Zyex filaments.\nPolyolefin.\nPolyolefin is one of the softest synthetic string materials, rivaling some Zyex and most nylon multi-filaments. It offers mediocre durability and tension retention, so it is generally used as the cross string in a hybrid string setup. For those who do not break strings very quickly, however, 100% polyolefin stringing may be a good alternative to natural gut and multi-filament strings. This is especially true for those who have had tennis elbow and find natural gut string to be too costly.\nMetal wire.\nMetal wire, usually piano wire, was used in some historical racquets.\nTitanium.\nTitanium is also used. Usually Titanium strings are based on Nylon or multi-filament strings with the titanium applied with the coating of the string, to protect the material from UV and abrasion, or is integrated into the filaments to modify the play-ability of the string. Based on Nylon or multi-filament strings, the titanium is either applied with the coating of the string, protecting the material from UV radiation and abrasion, or the titanium is integrated into the filaments to modify the play-ability of the string. Titanium strings are no longer popular today. \nGauge.\nThe \"gauge\" number determines the thickness of the string. A string rated with a high gauge number is a thinner string, and vice versa. Thinner strings typically offer higher performance but break more frequently than thicker strings.\nStringing pattern.\nVirtually all modern racquets are strung in a criss-cross horizontal-vertical pattern. Various other patterns have been used in history with varying success.\nDouble-strung tennis racquets were introduced in 1977 but the so-called spaghetti racquets were later banned because they permitted excessive spin and were too successful. \nRacquets are strung either with two separate strings (and thus four knots), or with a single string (resulting in only two knots). Sometimes, a hybrid of two different string types may be used in the same racquet. Traditionally, a double half hitch has been used to tie off tennis string, along with a starting knot. Recently, new kinds of knots have been used called the \"pro-knot\" and \"Parnell knot\". Along with the use of a starting clamp, this can make all the knots identical, and improve the aesthetics of a string job.\nStringing.\nThe process of installing strings in the racquet is called \"stringing,\" and is done with a racquet string machine. These machines vary in complexity, accuracy and price.\nString tension.\nThe \"string tension\" of a racquet, usually expressed in pounds, indicates the pressure under which the strings are secured to the frame. The string tension affects a racquet's playing characteristics, such as the \"feel\" of the ball, control over the ball, as well as maximizing power.\nAll racquets come with recommended string tensions, most of which lie between 50 and 70 pounds (220 to 310 N).\nA loosely strung racquet will usually have a larger sweet spot and will hit farther but, when swung hard enough, it will shoot balls unpredictably; a tighter string job will help make delicate shots with more finesse and control.\nAn extremely tightly strung racquet cuts down on a tennis player's feel on the ball, but can give the player excellent control if swung hard enough, with a smooth stroke. Such tension may make delicate shots more difficult, but makes play from the baseline more constant. However, if a player often hits powerful shots, a tightly strung racquet may quickly tire the arm, possibly resulting in tennis elbow.\nMany professional stringers advise players to string racquets with the lowest tension possible while still being able to maintain control of the ball. Beginning players trying to find their tension should start in the middle of the recommended tension range and adjust the tension from there to meet their needs. The recommended tension is usually printed on the racquet. With a lower tension the racquet will have more power and less control; with a higher tension, it will have less power and more control.\nRestringing.\nDue to the tension present on the strings, elasticity and tension begins to decrease the moment they are installed in a racquet. \"Dead strings\", or strings which have lost their tension, cut down on the performance of a racquet. Dead strings may also hamper a tennis player's ability to generate power and pace, and may even make their arm sore.\nThe frequency of restringing depends on the player and the racquet, but there are a few recommended intervals. One is to restring the racquet as many times in a year as the player uses it in a week; e.g., if the racquet is used three times per week, it should be restrung three times per year. Another guideline is to restring after every 40 hours of play; if the racquet is used three times per week and three hours per session, it should be restrung approximately every five weeks. If the player has access to a tennis string tension meter (or access to a pro shop equipped with one), he may restring his racquet after he measures a loss of 25% or more of stringbed stiffness. However, many players who hit the ball hard enough to break the strings simply restring rackets whenever the strings break.\nUnited States Racquet Stringers Association.\nThe United States Racquet Stringers Association (USRSA) offers two levels of certification for stringers: the Certified Stringer and the Master Racquet Technician, of which around 350 exist worldwide. The Master Racquet Technician certification process includes testing of the stringer's ability to string a racquet, perform grip work, identify mistakes in an improperly strung racquet, and pass a written test that covers not only strings, but racquet technology as well.\nSince 2004, \"RSi,\" the USRSA's monthly magazine, has named a Stringer of the Year.

It was the fifteenth race of the 2006 Formula One season, and was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari car.\nImmediately following the race, Schumacher announced that he would retire from motor racing at the end of the 2006 season. Robert Kubica achieved his first career podium finish, in only his third Grand Prix. It was also only the second Grand Prix meeting appearance of Kubica's Friday driver successor, Sebastian Vettel. Vettel had impressed at the by setting the fastest time in one session, but he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions at this Grand Prix. The race was also the first race to see the introduction of a new High Speed Barrier developed by the FIA Institute and the FIA. The system, which was installed at the end of the run-off areas at the circuit's second chicane and \"Parabolica\" corners, was designed for use at corners with high speed approaches and limited run-off areas. Also this was the last race of the Red Bull driver Christian Klien, until his return to a race seat at the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix.\nAfter the race, in the press conference, Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula One. On the same day, it was announced that Ferrari would replace Schumacher with Kimi Räikkönen. The race was his 90th victory. Four years later however in , Schumacher returned to F1 with Mercedes.\nFriday drivers.\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2005 Constructors' Championship and Super Aguri were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\nRace report.\nAt the start Kimi Räikkönen got away in the lead with Michael Schumacher and Nick Heidfeld tussling over 2nd. By lap 2 Fernando Alonso was up to 6th past Heidfeld as Schumacher and Räikkönen begin to pull clear of the rest. On lap 10 Nico Rosberg lost power in his Williams and was the first retirement, his 4th consecutive retirement. On lap 15 Räikkönen pitted from the lead and two laps later Schumacher came in and jumped him, Robert Kubica took the lead stopping much later, on lap 23, which allowed Schumacher into the lead for the first time in the race. On lap 44 there was drama when Alonso pulled over with a smoky Renault after an engine failure, this caused a problem for Massa who locked up behind him and went off before pitting to change tyres. Michael Schumacher cruised to victory ahead of Räikkönen, with Kubica claiming his first podium in 3rd place."

He succeeded in closing the gap from 5.4 seconds on lap 10 to 4.2 seconds by lap 27 only for it to open up to 5.9 seconds by lap 34 after the two drivers encountered backmarkers. The race was crucial in the fight for the World Championship, as whoever finished ahead of the two would take the championship lead into the final race. On lap 37, after the two rivals had made their final pitstops, Schumacher's engine failed, his first engine failure since the 2000 French Grand Prix, giving the lead to Alonso, who went on to win the race. As a result, he needed only one point from the final race to secure the title.\n, Alonso's win remains the last victory for a car running on Michelin tyres, as the manufacturer pulled out of Formula One at the end of the season. Third place finisher Giancarlo Fisichella dedicated to his best friend, Tonino Visciani, who had died on 5 October 2006 after a heart attack."

        "text": "The LSU Tigers baseball team represents Louisiana State University in NCAA Division I college baseball. The team participates in the West Division of the Southeastern Conference. The Tigers play home games on LSU's campus at Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field, and they are currently coached by Jay Johnson.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1893–1962).\nDuring the program's first 30 seasons, LSU had a total of 15 head coaches. No coach's tenure lasted longer than two seasons, with the exception of C. C. Stroud, who was head coach for eight seasons. Stroud coached LSU from 1914 to 1921 and had an overall record of 73–58–5 (.595). The program won at least ten games during four of his eight seasons as head coach.\nHarry Rabenhorst (1927–1956).\nIn 1927, Harry Rabenhorst became head baseball coach and became the longest tenured head baseball coach in LSU history. Rabenhorst began his career at LSU in 1925 as the head coach of the men's basketball team and two years later, in 1927, he also added head baseball coach to his duties. As baseball coach, he won two SEC baseball titles and was named SEC Coach of the Year in 1939 and 1946. Rabenhorst coached the baseball team from 1927 until 1942 when he left to serve in World War II. When he returned, he again coached the baseball team from 1946 until 1956. He finished his baseball coaching career with a record of 220–226–3. Later, as an athletic department administrator, he became the school's athletic director in 1967.\nIn 1938, LSU's new baseball stadium, referred to as either LSU Diamond or LSU Varsity Baseball Field, opened. The stadium was later renamed Alex Box Stadium for Simeon Alex Box, an LSU letterman (1942) who was killed in North Africa during World War II.\nA. L. Swanson (1943–1945)\nDuring Rabenhorst's absence serving in World War II, A. L. Swanson served as head coach from 1943 to 1945. The Tigers won the 1943 SEC Championship under Swanson.\nRay Didier (1957–1963).\nRaymond \"Ray\" Didier was head coach at LSU for 7 seasons from 1957 to 1963. He had an overall record of 104–79–1 (.568). He coached the 1961 team to the SEC championship. He left LSU to become Athletic director and head baseball coach at Nicholls State University.\nWaldrop-Smith-Lamabe (1964–1983).\nFrom 1964 to 1983, LSU was led by three head coaches. From 1964 to 1965, Jim Waldrop coached LSU for two seasons and had a 17–24 (.415) record. Jim Smith was head coach for 13 seasons from 1966 to 1978. He finished with an overall record of 238–251 (.487). When he left LSU after the 1978 season, he had the most wins of any head coach in program history. His 1975 team won an SEC championship and was LSU's first NCAA tournament team. From 1979 to 1983, Jack Lamabe was head coach at LSU for five seasons and had a record of 134–115 (.538).\nSkip Bertman (1984–2001).\n1984–1990.\nAfter playing college baseball at Miami (FL), coaching high school baseball, and serving as an assistant at Miami, Skip Bertman became LSU's head coach for the start of the 1984 season.\nIn Bertman's second season, 1985, the Tigers qualified for postseason play for the first time in ten years. In his third season, LSU made its first appearance in the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, the first of 11 appearances during Bertman's 18-year career. LSU returned to Omaha during the 1987 season, then failed to make the NCAA tournament in 1988, despite having a 39–21 record.\nBertman's 1989 team returned to the postseason, an appearance that started a streak of 17 consecutive postseason appearances. The 1989 team defeated Texas A&amp;M in a regional final to qualify for the College World Series. The program also made the College World Series in 1990.\n1991 national championship.\nThe program won its first national championship in 1991, defeating Wichita State in the College World Series final.\n1993 national championship.\nThe program won its second national championship in 1993, again defeating Wichita State in the College World Series final.\n1996 national championship.\nIn 1996, the Tigers entered the NCAA tournament on a two-game losing streak, after being eliminated from the SEC tournament by consecutive losses to Florida and Kentucky. However, based on the team's regular season performance, LSU was selected as one of the eight regional host sites for the NCAA tournament. The Tigers defeated Austin Peay, UNLV, and New Orleans before defeating Georgia Tech, 29–13, in the regional final. In the game, LSU broke multiple NCAA records, two of which still stand today: 13 hits in an inning and 8 doubles in an inning.\nIn the College World Series, the team defeated its first opponent, Wichita State, 9–8. LSU then faced Florida, which had beaten them three times in the regular season and once in the SEC Tournament, and won, 9–4. Florida came out of the losers' bracket to face LSU again, and LSU won, 2–1, to advance to the national championship game against Miami (FL).\nIn the game, LSU defeated Miami, 9–8, on a walk-off home run by Warren Morris. In the bottom of the 9th inning with two outs and the tying run on third base, Morris hit a home run to right field off of Miami freshman Robbie Morrison. The home run was Morris's first of the season, and it won the 1997 Showstopper of the Year ESPY Award.\n1997 national championship.\nLSU entered the 1997 season attempting to become the first team to win consecutive national championships since Stanford won championships in 1987 and 1988. The Tigers began the season with 19 consecutive wins, giving them 27 straight wins starting with the 1996 regional.\nIn the South I Regional, LSU lost the winner's bracket final to South Alabama, meaning the team had to win three games within 24 hours in order to advance to the College World Series. The Tigers won a five-hour game against Long Beach State, 14–7 in 11 innings, in which Bertman was ejected in the eighth inning for arguing a balk call. LSU then defeated South Alabama 14–4 and 15–4 to advance to the World Series.\nThere, the Tigers narrowly defeated Rice, but Larson's home run in the bottom of the seventh gave LSU a 5–4 victory. The Tigers then defeated Stanford, 10–5 and 13–9, before defeating Alabama 13–6 in the championship game.\n1998 season.\nIn 1998, LSU hit 161 home runs. Eddy Furniss won the Dick Howser Trophy as the nation's most outstanding player and finished as the LSU and SEC all-time leader in home runs (80), RBI (308), hits (352), doubles (87) and total bases (689). Brad Cresse and Trey McClure also earned All-America honors by hitting 29 and 27 home runs, respectively.\nThe Tigers went undefeated in the South II Regional to reach the College World Series, seeking to become the first team to win three consecutive championships since USC won five consecutive from 1970 to 1974. LSU hit eight home runs in its first game in Omaha, defeating USC, 12–10, then hit six more in a 10–8 victory over SEC team Mississippi State. However, in the final two games, and the Tigers lost 5–4 and 7–3 to USC, which went on to win the championship with a 21–14 victory over Arizona State.\n2000 national championship.\nIn 2000, LSU's regular season record was 39–17, and the team went undefeated in the SEC tournament to earn the #2 National seed in the NCAA tournament. LSU won the Baton Rouge Regional in three games, outscoring opponents 45–4. LSU then swept a best-of-three Super Regional against UCLA, winning 8–2 and 14–8.\nLSU began play at the College World Series with a 13–5 win over Texas. In game two, LSU defeated USC, 10–4. In a close third game, LSU defeated Florida State, 6–3, and advanced to the championship game to face Stanford.\nIn the championship game on June 17, Stanford held an early 5–2 lead, but LSU scored three runs in the eighth inning with two home runs. LSU reliever Trey Hodges did not allow a run in the top of the ninth, his fourth scoreless inning of the game. In the bottom of the ninth, LSU lead the inning off with a single and a walk to bring Brad Cresse to the plate with two runners on base. Cresse, who was 1–12 in the CWS prior to the at bat, hit a line drive single into left field to score Ryan Theriot from second, giving LSU its fifth national championship in 10 years. LSU had 5 players named to the All-Tournament team– Blair Barbier, Mike Fontenot, Brad Hawpe, Hodges, and Theriot. Hodges was named the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player after finishing the CWS with a 2–0 record and one save.\nLSU finished the 2000 postseason with a 13–0 record and moved to 5–0 all time in national championship games.\nRetirement.\nSkip Bertman led the Tigers to a 44–22–1 mark during his final season as head coach in 2001. The Tigers won the West Division, reached the SEC Tournament championship game, and won the Baton Rouge Regional, but lost in three games in a Super Regional against Tulane at Zephyr Field.\nBertman won 870 games, seven SEC titles, and 11 CWS appearances. His teams averaged 48 wins per year and qualified for the NCAA tournament in 16 of his 18 seasons.\nHis jersey number, 15, is one of four numbers retired by LSU. LSU also renamed a part of South Stadium Drive, between Nicholson and River Road, Skip Bertman Drive in his honor. The renamed portion runs past the old Alex Box Stadium, which has now been demolished following the opening of LSU's new stadium in 2009, the field of which is named for Bertman.\nIn a \"Baseball America\" poll published in 1999, Bertman was voted the second greatest college baseball coach of the 20th century, behind Rod Dedeaux of Southern California.\nIn June 2002, Bertman was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in January 2003. In 2006, Skip Bertman was inducted into the inaugural class of the College Baseball Hall of Fame in Lubbock, Texas.\nAfter the end of the 2001 season, Bertman became LSU's athletic director. During his tenure, LSU won six total national championships and two BCS National Titles. Bertman served in the position until June 2008, and as Athletic Director Emeritus until June 2010.\nIn anticipation of Bertman's retirement, Louisiana-Monroe coach Smoke Laval was brought on as an administrative assistant for the LSU baseball team in 2001 and succeeded Bertman as coach in 2002. Laval was returning to LSU where he served as an assistant coach under Bertman from 1984 to 1993. In 1993, Laval left LSU for ULM (then known as Northeast Louisiana). While at NLU/ULM, Laval posted a record of 241–159, a winning percentage of .603, and led the Indians (Now Warhawks) to 3 NCAA regional appearances.\nSmoke Laval (2002–2006).\nThe expectations were lofty for Laval when he accepted the job as head coach at LSU. In his first year, Laval led the Tigers to a 44–22 record overall. The Tigers hosted a regional in Baton Rouge, which they won, and moved on to the Houston Super-Regional to face Rice, where their season ended. His first year at the helm raised expectations even more after he experienced great success.\nIn 2003 and 2004, Laval would lead the Tigers to 45–22–1 and 46–19 overall record respectively. LSU would earn the No. 2 national seed in the 2003 tournament, and would host a super regional both years, meaning the road to Omaha went through Baton Rouge. LSU made the College World Series both years, but disappointed both years, posting an 0–2 record each year. Tiger fans were not used to leaving Omaha without a win, so questions about Laval's leadership and ability to continue the success of the program began to arise.\nIn 2005, LSU struggled during the regular season despite a 40–22 record overall. The Tigers lost 12 games in SEC play and lost to Southern for only the second time in 41 tries. Rice would go on to defeat the Tigers in the Baton Rouge Regional Finals.\nIt was obvious that 2006 would be a critical year for Laval. However, that year would see LSU post a 35–24 mark overall, their worst since 1983. They also posted their first losing SEC record in 23 years and would miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years. Under growing pressure from fans and the administration, Laval officially resigned on June 4, 2006.\nPaul Mainieri (2007–2021).\n2007–2008.\nOn June 28, 2006, Paul Mainieri was named the twenty-fifth head coach of LSU Baseball. Mainieri returned to Baton Rouge, where he began his career in college baseball 30 years earlier as a freshman at LSU in 1976. Mainieri finished his collegiate playing career at the University of New Orleans. Prior to his arrival at LSU, Mainieri coached St. Thomas University in Florida, Air Force, and Notre Dame.\nIn his first season at LSU, the Tigers posted a mark of 29–26–1. The season was full of ups and downs, with the Tigers winning four SEC series against Top 25 opponents, but struggling in non-conference play. After the season, Mainieri realized changes had to be made and informed certain players that they should consider other options, as well as making some changes to his current staff. Mainieri was able to put together a tremendous recruiting class following the 2007 season, which was later ranked No. 1 by \"Baseball News\".\nIn his second year, LSU was predicted to finish fifth in the SEC Western division by the SEC baseball coaches before the year started. Following an amazing turnaround, Coach Mainieri led LSU to the SEC Western Division championship with a conference record of 18–11–1, and the No. 2 seed in the 2008 SEC baseball tournament. The Tigers finished the regular season record at 39–16–1. The team won the 2008 SEC Tournament (held May 20–25 in Hoover, Alabama). With the win, LSU won 20 consecutive games, breaking the previous school record of 19 consecutive wins during the 1997 season and tying the SEC's second-longest streak of wins. Fourteen of those wins were come-from-behind wins, while the last 15 were made wearing the distinctive gold jerseys.\nBy winning the SEC Tournament, LSU earned a 7th national seed in the NCAA tournament and extended the life of the old Alex Box Stadium as Baton Rouge hosted a regional bracket of the NCAA tournament. LSU swept the series, defeating Texas Southern (12–1) and Southern Miss (twice, 13–4 and 11–4) to win the regional bracket. With the sweep of the Regional series, LSU extended their winning streak to a SEC-record 23 straight games.\nAs a result of the Regional, LSU and Baton Rouge earned a spot in the Super-Regional series, hosting UC-Irvine in the last three games to be played in the old Alex Box Stadium. LSU lost the first game, 11–5, ending their streak of wins at 23. LSU recovered in the second game of the series, scoring six runs in the top of the ninth inning to force a third game with a dramatic come-from-behind win, 9–7. On Monday, June 9, 2008, in the final game to be played at the Alex Box Stadium, with a record-setting crowd of 8,173 watching, LSU dominated UC-Irvine with a 21–7 win to move to the 2008 College World Series.\nIn the 2008 College World Series, No. 7 LSU faced the No. 2 North Carolina Tarheels in the first round, losing 8–4. The Tigers, facing elimination in a game against the Rice Owls, won in dramatic fashion, 6–5, continuing their string of come-from-behind victories. On June 20, 2008, after a rain delay of nearly 24 hours, UNC and LSU resumed their elimination game matchup, resulting in a 7–3 loss for LSU. The team was defeated after giving up the only grand slam in the 2008 CWS in the top of the ninth inning. During the 2008 regular and post-regulation baseball season, LSU's games have continuously featured both dramatic victories and controversial calls.\n2009 national championship.\nThe 2009 season was the first for LSU playing at Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field. In the post-season, LSU traveled to Omaha after sweeping Southern University, Baylor University and the University of Minnesota in the regionals and Rice University in the super regionals.\nThey started play at the College World Series and faced the Virginia Cavaliers in the first round, winning 9–5. In the winner's bracket game, LSU played the Arkansas Razorbacks and won by a score of 9–1. In a rematch, the Tigers beat the Razorbacks again by a score of 14–5, advancing to the CWS finals for the first time since 2000. They played against the Texas Longhorns in a best-of-three series for the title, and won Game 1, 7–6 in a dramatic comeback win in 11 innings. The Longhorns beat the Tigers in game 2, 5–1, to force a third and final game. The Tigers out-slugged the Longhorns 11–4 in game 3 to win their 6th National Championship and first since 2000. The series MVP was outfielder Jared Mitchell.\n2010–2021.\nUnder Mainieri, the Tigers also played in the 2013 and 2015 College World Series. During the 2015 MLB Draft, Alex Bregman was selected by the Houston Astros with the second pick of the draft. He was the fifth LSU Tiger to be drafted in the first round in seven years, the highest-drafted position player in LSU's history, and the second-highest overall behind pitcher Ben McDonald (1989).\nIn 2017, LSU played Florida in a best-of-three series to determine the winner of the 2017 College World Series. Florida defeated LSU and the Tigers finished as College World Series runner-up for the first time in school history.\nMainieri retired following LSU's 2021 super regional loss to SEC rival Tennessee at Knoxville. In 15 full seasons (the 2020 season ended after 17 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Mainieri compiled a 641-285-3 (.692) record.\nJay Johnson (since 2022).\nFollowing Mainieri's retirement, LSU hired Arizona baseball Head coach Jay Johnson who had just finished a run at the 2021 College World Series, posting an 0-2 exit.\nThe 2022 season saw the Tigers post a 40-22 overall record and a 3rd place finish in the SEC west. The team would suffer major losses such as sweeps to both Arkansas and eventual champion Ole Miss. The Tigers earned a berth at the Southern Miss Regional of the 2022 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, winning their first two games against Kennesaw St and regional host Southern Miss. before dropping their final 2 to the Golden Eagles.\n2023 national championship.\nThe 2023 season saw notable transfers come in such as DH Tommy White of NC State and RHP Paul Skenes of Air Force. Ranked Preseason #1 by D1 Baseball, the Tigers would hold this spot for 13 weeks until series losses to both Auburn and Mississippi State. After a 1-2 appearance at the 2023 Southeastern Conference baseball tournament, LSU would earn #5 national seed and host a Regional for the first time since 2019. With sweeps of their regional and a Super Regional versus Kentucky the Tigers would earn their first CWS appearance since 2017. LSU would go on to win their bracket in dramatic fashion against the #1 ranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the bottom of the 11th inning with a walkoff by Tommy White. LSU would then go on and defeat the Florida Gators 2-1 in the CWS Final, earning their seventh national championship in the sport. \nTraditions.\nAttendance.\nTotal Attendance: As of the 2018 baseball season, LSU has finished in the final college baseball total attendance rankings in 23 straight seasons. LSU posted a total attendance figure of 399,085 in 37 games.\nIn 2013, LSU posted an NCAA-record total attendance figure of 473,298 in 43 games, which was 191,458 greater than second-place team Mississippi State (281,840). LSU is also the only school in NCAA history to exceed 400,000 in total baseball attendance in a season.\nAverage Attendance: As of the 2018 baseball season, LSU finished No. 1 in the final average attendance rankings for the 22nd time in 23 years (Arkansas finished No. 1 in average attendance in 2007).

LSU defeated Tennessee, 5-2.\nGold Jerseys.\nLSU introduced gold jerseys for the 1996 post-season. The Tigers went on to win their 3rd National Championship that year while wearing the gold jerseys in the championship game. The jerseys became part of LSU Baseball lore when with 2 outs and a runner on third base with LSU losing 8–7 in the bottom of the 9th inning, LSU's Warren Morris swung at the first pitch and lined the ball just inches over the right field fence for a game winning walk-off home run. This was his first home run of the season as he had missed 39 games with a broken bone in his hand. The jerseys became more ingrained in LSU lore when the Tigers also wore them during the 1997 post-season which resulted in another national championship, the program's 4th. After the 1996 and 1997 National Championships, the baseball program reserved the gold jerseys for select games.\nUnder head coach Paul Mainieri, the team wears the gold jerseys regularly on the third game of a three-game series, as well as during important tournament games. One such game was game 3 of the 2009 College World Series Finals versus the Texas Longhorns. The Tigers defeated the Longhorns 11–4 to win the programs 6th National Championship wearing the gold jerseys.\nLSU Bat Girls.\nThe LSU Bat Girls are a support squad that contributes to the LSU Baseball program. The Bat Girls consist of 30 individuals who work in teams of 10 at all home games, post-season games and various charity events. The squad serves as hostesses at Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field and their responsibilities include selling game day programs, recovering foul balls, retrieving bats and helmets, answering fans questions, assisting with game day promotions and giveaways and checking on umpires. They also assist the athletic department with many different aspects of the game such as attending coaches committee meetings.\nTailgating.\nTailgating is found across campus with many fans tailgating in the same spot year after year. Some tailgaters form affiliations or organizations and name their \"tailgating krewes\".\nLSU has continually been ranked as the top tailgating location in the country. ESPN.com ranked LSU as the top tailgating destination in America. The Sporting News proclaimed \"Saturday Night in Death Valley\" and Tiger tailgating as the top tradition in college football. Sports Illustrated said, \"When It Comes To Great Tailgating, Nothing Compares To LSU.\" LSU's tailgating was named No. 1 in an Associated Press poll on top tailgating spots and by a CNN network survey on top tailgating locations.\nVisiting team supporters can be heckled and chants of \"Tiger Bait! Tiger Bait!\" are sometimes directed at opposing teams' fans. The opposing fans who take the jeers and jaunts with a sporting disposition will be invited to join in on the party, the drink, the regional Cajun cuisine, the spirit of Baton Rouge, and the vibrant tradition of LSU sports. During baseball season some fans will tailgate for the entire three days of a weekend series.\nSuper Fans.\nChris \"Mouth of the South\" Guillot will lead chants of \"Here We Go Tigers\" and others to cheer on the LSU Tigers and distract opponents. Chris graduated from LSU in 1986 and rarely misses any games.\nAnita \"K-Lady\" Haywood is known for hanging \"K\" signs in the stands that denote strikeouts by LSU pitchers. Anita graduated from Louisiana Tech University, but grew up in Baton Rouge and began attending LSU baseball games regularly after meeting her husband who loved LSU baseball.

It was most notable for \"The Intimidator\", a large billboard behind the right-field fence featuring the six years in which LSU had won the College World Series while playing in the stadium. The field was also notable for giving up many home runs due to the high humidity of Louisiana, the prevailing winds out of the south which push balls hit to left field out of the park, and the short fences (the dimensions were believed to be anywhere from 7–10 feet shorter than what was posted on the fences).\nSecond LSU Diamond.\nFor the 1936 and 1937 seasons, LSU Baseball played on its second diamond on the new Baton Rouge campus.

        "title": "History of rock climbing",
        "text": "In the history of rock climbing, the three main sub-disciplines—bouldering, single-pitch climbing, and big wall (and multi-pitch) climbing—can trace their origins to late 19th-century Europe. Bouldering started in Fontainebleau, and was advanced by Pierre Allain in the 1930s, and John Gill in the 1950s. Big wall climbing started in the Dolomites, and was spread across the Alps in the 1930s by climbers such as Emilio Comici and Riccardo Cassin, and in the 1950s by Walter Bonatti, before reaching Yosemite where it was led in the 1950s to 1970s by climbers such as Royal Robbins. Single-pitch climbing started pre-1900 in both the Lake District and in Saxony, and by the late-1970s had spread widely with climbers such as Ron Fawcett (Britain), Bernd Arnold (Germany), Patrick Berhault (France), Ron Kauk and John Bachar (USA).\nAs a free solo exercise with no artificial aid or climbing protection, bouldering remained largely consistent since its origins. Single-pitch climbing generally stopped using artificial aid in the early 20th-century, led by Paul Preuss, so-called \"free climbing\". Free climbing of Big Walls started before World War I, and was advanced by in the 20s, in the 30s, and Mathias Rebitsch in the late-40s. Climbing protection was needed for single-pitch and big-wall free climbing, and was inserted into the route while climbing; this is now called \"traditional climbing\". By the 1980s, French pioneers like Patrick Edlinger wanted to climb rock faces in Buoux and Verdon that had few cracks in which to insert traditional climbing protection. Controversially, they pre-drilled bolts from above on rappel, using battery powered drills, into potential new routes for protection (but not as artificial aid); this became known as \"sport climbing\". It led to a dramatic increase in climbing standards, grades, and tools (e.g. artificial climbing walls and campus boards), the development of competition climbing (initially dominated in the 1990s by French climbers such as François Legrand), and the \"professional\" rock climber.\nBy the end of the 20th-century, the hardest sport climbs were often combinations of bouldering-moves, and some of the best challenges lay in free climbing extreme big walls; this led to greater cross-over amongst the three sub-disciplines. Leading climbers such as Wolfgang Güllich, Jerry Moffatt, Alexander Huber, Fred Nicole, Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, and Tommy Caldwell set records in several of these disciplines. Güllich and Huber also made ever-bolder single-pitch free solo climbs, while Sharma pushed standards in deep-water soloing; Alex Honnold's big wall free soloing was turned into the Oscar-winning film, \"Free Solo\". In 2016, the IOC announced that competition climbing would be a medal sport in the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nFemale rock climbing developed later in the 20th-century but by the 1980s, climbers such as Lynn Hill and Catherine Destivelle were closing the gap to the standard of routes being climbed by the leading men. By the 21st-century, Josune Bereziartu, Angela Eiter and Ashima Shiraishi, had closed the gap to the highest sport and boulder climbing grades achieved by men to within one/two notches; Beth Rodden fully closed the gap for traditional climbing grades in 2008 and Janja Garnbret became the most successful competition climber in history with 42 IFSC world cup golds.\nOrigins.\nThere are early documented examples of people \"rock climbing\" to achieve various objectives. The \"\" records that in 1492, ordered by his king, Antoine de Ville used castle siege tactics to ascend Mont Aiguille, a 300-meter rock tower, near Grenoble, France. In 1695, Martin Martin described the traditional practice of fowling by climbing with the use of ropes in the Hebrides of Scotland, especially on St Kilda.\nThe first ascent of Mont Blanc in 1786, started mountaineering's \"modern era\"; however it would take another century until the fixed anchors of rock climbing appeared, including pitons, bolts, and rappel slings. By the early 19th-century, \"alpine rock climbing\" was developing as a pastime; the tools of the alpine shepherd guides (early mountain guides), the alpenstock and woodcutter's axe (later combined as the ice axe).\nAlthough the action of rock climbing had become a component of 19th-century victorian era Alpine mountaineering, a sport of rock climbing (i.e. climbing short rock routes as a recreational activity without any summit objective), originated in the last quarter of the 19th-century, and in four European locations: the Saxon Switzerland climbing region in Germany, the Lake District and Peak District in England, the Dolomites in Italy, and in the forest of Fontainebleau in France."

        "title": "Mark Coyne (rugby league)",
        "text": "Mark Coyne (born 16 August 1967) is an Australian former rugby league footballer, a state and international representative player and an Insurance Executive. His football club career was with the St George Dragons and the joint-venture of the St George Illawarra Dragons – he captained both sides. He played principally at but sometimes as a in his notable representative career. He was also the brother of another first grade footballer, Peter Coyne.\nIn an era when players also worked while playing Coyne had already spent ten years working in the financial industry having completed a marketing degree before retiring from the NRL in 1999. Coyne then moved into the insurance industry focussing on personal injury claims.\nClub career.\nA Queenslander, Coyne was graded with the Brothers club at Sunnybank, Brisbane, playing in the 1987 Brisbane Rugby League Grand Final and scoring a try. He then relocated to the St George Dragons in Sydney in 1988. He made his first grade debut in 1989 and impressed with his trademark right foot step.\nIn Round 14 of the 1991 season, Coyne became the first player to score a try on the famous Adelaide Oval in the first NSWRL premiership match played in South Australia. On a cold and wet night in June, St George defeated Balmain 16–2 in front of 28,884 fans, the largest attendance of the 1991 minor round.\nIn 1992, Coyne played in St George's 28-8 Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. Coyne played in the 1993 Grand Final for the St George club where once again they lost to Brisbane 14–6. 1994 saw Coyne take on the role as captain of St George, a year when they failed to make the finals.\nCoyne's leadership capabilities were fully acknowledged in 1995 when he was captain of St George, vice-captain of Queensland and made his test debut for the Kangaroos. In 1996 Coyne lead the Dragons to another grand final, but despite playing a great game himself the club lost controversially to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 20–8.\nIn 1998, Coyne was honoured with a testimonial year at St George and impressively, he chose to donate all the proceeds ($135,000) of that testimonial season to a children's charity.\nCoyne retired in 1999, whilst playing for the St. George Illawarra Dragons and after 12 seasons wearing the Dragons' Big Red V. By the end of his career he had played in 9 Test matches; 19 Origins and more than 200 first grade matches, of which more than 100 were as captain.\nRepresentative career.\nCoyne made his State of Origin debut in game II of 1990 for Queensland, after impressive performances in the centres for his club. He had to bide his time and wait another two years before being selected for Queensland in games II and III of 1992. In game II that year Coyne popped up a great pass to send Billy Moore over for a try. Queensland went on to win the match 5–4. In 1993 Coyne played in all three games and set up a try for Mal Meninga in game II.\nBut 1994 would ultimately provide the most memorable of Coyne's State of Origin appearances and enabled his entry to the annals of Maroon and Origin folklore. In game I, with Queensland down 12-10 and 40 seconds left on the clock, from deep in their own half the Maroons started one of the most memorable try-scoring movements. Allan Langer handled the ball twice in the 11-pass sequence which was finished when Coyne extended his arm in the right corner to thwart the last ditched defensive efforts of Brad Fittler and Ricky Stuart, breaking Blues' hearts in the process and winning the match in a heart-stopping finish. Although NSW went on to win the series 2–1, Channel 9 television commentator Ray \"Rabbits\" Warren famously stated in his call of the try \"That's not a try that's a miracle\".\nUnfortunately for Coyne, St George suffered a severe downturn in form during the second half of the 1994 NSWRL season, though his own form was still good and he was considered unlucky to miss selection for the successful 1994 Kangaroo tour.\nLoyal to the ARL during the Super League war Coyne was one of a handful of senior Queensland players available for representative honours that year and along with Trevor Gillmeister and Dale Shearer he brought experience and spirit to the young Queensland side and their novice coach Paul Vautin. History shows that Queensland won the 1995 Origin series 3–0. Before the 1995 series, Vautin's relatively inexperienced Qld team were not even rated a chance of winning a game against a NSW team that had won the previous 3 Origin series, were coached by Phil Gould and could boast test players Brad Fittler, Tim Brasher, Rod Wishart, Paul McGregor, Greg Florimo, Mark Carroll, Brad Mackay, Geoff Toovey, and future stars Andrew Johns and Steve Menzies\nHis ARL loyalty was repaid when he made his Australian representative debut in the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand and he played in the first two Tests of the series, only missing the final test at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane through injury. The ARL only Kangaroos defeated the Kiwis 3–0. Later that year Coyne was selected in Australia's 1995 Rugby League World Cup squad, played in two pool games (including losing the opening game of the tournament to England at Wembley Stadium, London where he scored his first test try), the 30–20 extra-time semi-final win against New Zealand, and was a member of side that won the final against England 16–8 at Wembley Stadium, London.\nHe was a mainstay of Australian representative sides during the schismatic years of Super League and made further representative appearances against Papua New Guinea, Fiji and a Rest of the World side in 1997.\nLater years.\nBetween 2003 and 2009, Coyne held various positions within GIO Insurance, culminating in his appointment in 2007 as executive general manager of their national workers compensation claims business. He has previously held the position of chief executive/managing director of Coal Services Pty Ltd (February 2010–December 2011), a specialist workers compensation insurance scheme for the coal mining industry. Coyne became CEO of EML (Employers Mutual Limited), a workers compensation claims management mutual in 2012.\nCoyne was an NRL Judiciary panel member (2008-2014), NRL and independent chairman of RLPA Education and Welfare Committee for seven years from 2006 to 2014. He became a director of Police and Citizens Youth Club from 2002 to 2012 and a director of the NRMA Road Service between 2000 and 2003. He later became a benefactor of the NSW Children's Cancer Institute and a board member of the Sporting Chance Cancer Foundation.\nOn 28 February 2019, Coyne was appointed as an Australian Rugby League Commission commissioner. On 17 July, Coyne stood down as an ARLC commissioner following an incident in Singapore. Returning to Australia, he pleaded guilty to the charge of abusing an officer and was fined A$4,000."

        "text": "Ralph Mevlin Graham (August 16, 1910 – October 14, 2005) was an American football, basketball, and tennis player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the Municipal University of Wichita—now Wichita State University—in 1942 and from 1946 to 1947 and at Kansas State University from 1948 to 1950, compiling a career college football record of 21–39–1.\nPlaying career.\nGraham, a native of El Dorado, Kansas, played football at Kansas State University under head coach Bo McMillin. Known as \"Rammin' Ralph\", he was a first team All-Big Six Conference fullback each year from 1931 to 1933. He nearly led K-State to the Rose Bowl in 1931 before getting injured. Following his senior season, Graham was a starter in the East–West Shrine Game, becoming the first Kansas State football player to be named to an all-star game. Graham graduated as the all-time leading scorer at Kansas State, and held that record for 64 years until it was surpassed by kicker Martín Gramática in 1997.\nCoaching career.\nUpon graduation in 1934, Graham entered the football coaching profession as an assistant to McMillin, who moved from Kansas State to Indiana University that season. Graham remained an assistant football and basketball coach at Indiana until 1942, where he also earned a master's degree and was head coach of the tennis team. During this time, Graham was the top assistant for Branch McCracken's 1940 national championship basketball team.\nWichita.\nGraham returned to Kansas in 1942 to serve as athletics director and head football coach at the University of Wichita, now Wichita State University. During his first season as head coach, Graham led Wichita to a 5–4 record, including a win over his alma mater. After taking the next three seasons off to serve in World War II, Graham returned to Wichita to coach two more successful seasons in 1946 and 1947. Following the 1947 season he led Wichita to the Raisin Bowl, played on January 1, 1948.\nGraham was the 18th head coach for the Shockers. His overall coaching record at Wichita was 17 wins and 13 losses. This ranks him fifth at Wichita in terms of total wins and 11th at the school in terms of winning percentage.\nKansas State.\nIn the wake of his success at Wichita, Graham was hired as the 22nd head football coach at Kansas State in 1948. At the time he took the job, K-State was mired in a 26-game losing streak, the longest in NCAA history to that point. Graham managed to break the streak with a win in his third game. (The full 28-game streak is still the second longest in NCAA FBS history.) In his second season, Graham started 2–0 and Kansas State beat Colorado in the second to snap a 22-game conference losing streak. However, the season fell apart after that point and the team finished 2–8. After coaching one more season, and posting a 1–9 record, Graham resigned from Kansas State following the 1950 season with a 4–26–1 mark during his tenure. Notably, the situation Graham inherited at Kansas State was so bad that this record represented an improvement over the prior three seasons. During his years at Kansas State, Graham also coached the school's tennis team.\nFollowing his years at Kansas State, Graham left the field of athletics.\nRacial integration.\nGraham was a pioneer in integrating collegiate athletics in the region. While at Kansas State he supported African American Harold Robinson in his football career and awarded him an athletic scholarship. Robinson broke the decades-long \"color barrier\" in the Big Seven Conference playing for Graham in 1949. Robinson later compared Graham to Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers who hired Jackie Robinson to integrate baseball in 1947. Integration was also a priority at Wichita, where one of Graham's best players was also African American—running back Linwood Sexton."

When Williams reported to Denver's training camp as a rookie, he was badly out of shape, prompting Nuggets coach Doug Moe to describe Williams as \"a fat little hog\".\nWilliams' collegiate career included a trip to the 1982 NCAA Final Four, where his Houston Cougars, better known as Phi Slama Jama, fell to the North Carolina Tar Heels in the National Semifinals.\nA former star at Milby High School in Houston, Williams was an electrifying player for the University of Houston, averaging 16 points per game as a freshman, 25 per game as a sophomore, and 21 points per game for the 1982 Final Four team. Williams was an All American and perennial All Southwest Conference performer. His collegiate teammates included Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Michael Young, Benny Anders and Larry Micheaux among others.\nIn his NBA career, Williams played in 153 games and scored a total of 1,319 points. Following his brief NBA career, he played professionally in the Continental Basketball Association, Italy, Australia, Spain, and the Philippines.\nIn 1986, Williams played for Tanduay Rhum in the Philippine Basketball Association's (PBA) Reinforced Conference that year, where teams were allowed to suit up two imports no taller than 6 ft 3 in. Along with partner Andre McKoy and local superstars Ramon Fernandez, Freddie Hubalde and Willie Generalao, among others, the flamboyant and sweet-shooting Williams led Tanduay to its first championship in franchise history.\nIn a May 2005 \"Houston Chronicle\" story, Williams admitted using drugs while he played. He suffered a stroke in January 1998 that left him blind in his left eye and partially paralyzed along the left side of his body.\nWilliams and his wife had operated a care facility for mentally-challenged adults in Katy, Texas.\nOn March 10, 2014, Rob Williams died of congestive heart failure at age 52."

        "title": "1913 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1913 Tour de France was the 11th edition of the Tour de France, taking place between 29 June and 27 July. The total distance was and the average speed of the riders was . The competition was won by the Belgian Philippe Thys, after in the crucial sixth stage Eugène Christophe broke his bicycle and lost several hours because he had to do the repairs by himself. In the last stage, Thys also had mechanical problems, but he got help during the repairs, and only got a penalty of ten minutes.\nBetween 1904 and 1912, the overall classification had been calculated by points, but in 1913 the classification was reverted to the original format from 1903, where the overall classification was calculated by adding up the times of the individual stages. The general classification has been calculated in the time format ever since.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1905, the format of the Tour de France had been changed from the time system to the points system, to reduce the cheating that had caused the first four cyclists of the 1904 Tour de France to be disqualified. In the 1912 Tour de France, this system had been working against Eugène Christophe's chances, who would have been leading the time classification up until the final stage where he allowed a group to ride away. The system had been working against a French cyclist and in favor of a Belgian cyclist (Odiel Defraye, who won the Tour de France in 1912), and the French organisation changed the system back again to the time system: the finishing times of all stages were added per cyclist, and the cyclist with the least total time was the winner. This was also intended to increase combativity, because in the points system riders did not care about time gaps, so escaped low-ranked riders were ignored by high-ranked cyclists.\nFor the first time, the route of the race was in the opposite direction. Prior to the 1913 race, the Tour the France always had been in the clockwise direction through France, and in 1913 it was anticlockwise.\nTeams.\nThe 1913 Tour started with 140 cyclists; there were 51 cyclists distributed over 9 teams, including all favourites for the overall victory. The remaining 89 cyclists started in the isolés category. \nAlthough cyclists had started in teams previously, the rules had forbidden them to work together against other cyclists. In 1913, this changed, and cyclists from the same team were allowed to work together. The organisers preferred riders to ride solo, so they added a rule that if a cyclist would win a stage with a margin of 20 minutes or more, he would not only get his own prize money, but also the half of all the other cyclists' prize money of that stage.\nThe first African cyclist took part in the Tour de France in 1913: Ali Neffati from Tunisia. Neffati had been discovered by Tour organiser Henri Desgrange, and would later become a driver at \"l'Auto\", the newspaper that organised the Tour de France.\nRace overview.\nThis edition started with six former Tour de France winners (Louis Trousselier, Lucien Petit-Breton, François Faber, Octave Lapize, Gustave Garrigou and Odile Defraye), the most ever.\nIn the first stages, not much happened in the overall classification, as most cyclists were saving their energy for the Pyrenees. The stage was won by Italian Giovanni Micheletto in a sprint. Micheletto was not part of the first group in the second stage, and thus lost his lead. There were four cyclists who had been in the lead group in both stages, and they were jointly leading the Tour.\nThe most important event occurred in the third stage, when former winner Lapize stopped the race; either because he considered his earning insufficient, or because he thought his team was not good enough.\nThe crucial stage proved to be the sixth. At the start of the sixth stage, last year's winner Defraye led the general classification, some 5 minutes ahead of Eugène Christophe. In that sixth stage, the first mountains were climbed. Defraye was dropped quickly, and Christophe led the race. Christophe came up first on the Aubisque, and in second place behind Philippe Thys on the Tourmalet. On the way down from the Tourmalet, Christophe was hit by a race vehicle, and his fork broke, rendering his bike unusable, and the rules said that he had to repair it himself. He walked more than 10 km down to the next village, and found a place where he could repair his bicycle. He worked on it for over three hours, being watched by race officials who made sure that he was not helped by anyone. When Christophe asked a small boy, of seven years old, to work the bellows, he was fined with ten minutes. During this repair, angry with the draconian rules, he snapped: (at the hungry race commissaires) \"If you're hungry, eat charcoal! [...] I am your prisoner and you will remain my wardens till the end\". After his bicycle was fixed, he rode away and finished the stage, 3 hours and 50 minutes later than the stage winner Thys. Christophe's chances to win the 1913 Tour de France were over.\nAfter that sixth stage, Marcel Buysse was in the lead. In the ninth stage, Buysse had mechanical failure with a broken handlebar, and finished almost three and a half hours after stage winner Lambot. This was the end of the chances for Buysse for the victory. Buysse did not give up, and won four of the remaining five stages.\nThe lead had transferred to Thys now. In the last stages, the race focussed on the duel between Petit-Breton and Thys. In the 14th stage, Petit-Breton fell down and stopped the race. In the same stage, Thys also fell down and remained unconscious for a while. When he was conscious again, he was helped to repair his bicycle. All help was illegal in 1913, but the jury only gave him a 10-minute penalty. Thys finished the stage, and kept 8'37\" in front of Gustave Garrigou in the general classification. In the final stage, Thys stayed with Garrigou, and so won the 1913 Tour de France.\nResults.\nGeneral classification.\nFor each cyclist, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time after the last stage was the winner. Of the 140 starting cyclists, 25 finished.\nIn the points system that had been used in previous years in the Tour de France, Garrigou would have won the race with 45 points, followed by Buysse with 48 points; Thys would have been third with 57 points.\nOther classifications.\nCamillo Bertarelli, ranked 8 in the general classification, became the winner of the \"isolés\" category. The \"isolés\" classification was calculated in the same way as the general classification, but only the isolated cyclists (not part of a team) were eligible.\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named Philippe Thys the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification."

Hosted by Queensland Cricket, the 50-over competition was held at the Peter Burge Oval of the Redlands Cricket Club, located on Wellington Point in southeast Brisbane.\nAffiliate nation Cook Islands, plus Associates Japan and Fiji made up the three-team field. Japan and Cook Islands advanced from the six-team 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup for fledgling cricketing nations. Fiji were inserted into the latter stage of regional qualifying rather than playing in the EAP Cricket Cup because they were the second-best team (and only other Associate) in the region during 2007 World Cup qualifying. (In fact, fellow EAP region Associate Papua New Guinea defeated Fiji in the WCQS Division 2 repechage competition, earning the final berth into the 2005 ICC Trophy.)\nEach team faced the others twice in a double round-robin format, for a total of six matches and four per team. Fiji rolled to easy victories, racking up the maximum of 8 points, while the Japanese and the Cooks split their matches to finish with one win apiece. (Cook Islands finished second based on a higher net run rate.) The closest match was the rain-shortened third match where Japan, chasing 74, rallied from a 5-over total of 14/3 to defeat the Cook Islands on the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nFiji advanced as the East Asia-Pacific region representative in Division 3 of the 2007 World Cricket League.\n2011 World Cup implications.\nThe three-team tournament determined the East Asia-Pacific representative for Division 3 of the 2007 World Cricket League. (One representative from each International Cricket Council Region qualifies for Division 3, the bottom division of the WCL, which will begin play in the early part of the year.)\nQualification for the 2011 Cricket World Cup was and is the ultimate goal of regional and WCL matches, since Division 3 teams can gain promotion up to 2009's World Cup qualifying tournament (or \"Division 1\") through WCL Division 2. The top teams from Division 2 advance to the 2009 qualifier. Lower teams in Division 2 will return to Division 3 in 2009 without having to advance through the 2008 regional qualifiers to earn a third-division slot.\nWCL play is the primary route into the 2011 Cup for non-Test playing nations. (The 2009 WCQ tournament replaces the 2005 ICC Trophy, the qualifying system for the 2007 version, as the pathway to the World Cup.)"

        "title": "Basketball (ball)",
        "text": "A basketball is a spherical ball used in basketball games. Basketballs usually range in size from very small promotional items that are only a few inches (some centimeters) in diameter to extra large balls nearly in diameter used in training exercises. For example, a youth basketball could be in circumference, while a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's ball would be a maximum of and an NCAA women's ball would be a maximum of . The standard for a basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is in circumference and for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), a maximum circumference of . High school and junior leagues normally use NCAA, NBA or WNBA sized balls.\nAside from the court and the baskets, the basketball is the only piece of equipment necessary to play the game of basketball. During the game, the ball must be bounced continuously (dribbling), thrown through the air to other players (passing) or thrown towards the basket (shooting). Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to. The ball is also used to perform tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning the ball on the tip of one's index finger, dribbling in complex patterns, rolling the ball over one's shoulder, or performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a slam dunk, most notably in the context of a slam dunk contest.\nCharacteristics.\nNearly all basketballs have an inflatable inner rubber bladder, generally wrapped in layers of fiber and then covered with a surface made either from leather (traditional), rubber, or a synthetic composite. As in most inflatable balls, there is a small opening that allows the pressure to be increased or decreased.\nThe surface of the ball is nearly always divided by \"ribs\" that are recessed below the surface of the ball in a variety of configurations and are generally a contrasting color. An orangish surface with black ribs and a possible logo is the traditional color scheme of basketballs but they are sold in various colors. Most famous of these variations, a red/white/blue basketball, was used for the American Basketball Association, the Harlem Globetrotters, and as the \"money ball\" in the NBA All-Star Weekend's Three Point Contest.\nBalls are generally designated for indoor (generally made of leather or absorbent composites), or all-surface use (generally made of rubber or durable composites, also known as indoor/outdoor balls). Indoor balls tend to be more expensive than all-surface balls due to the cost of materials. In addition, brand new all-leather indoor balls must be \"broken in\" first to achieve optimal grip before use in competition. The abrasiveness of asphalt and the dirt and moisture present in an outdoor setting will usually ruin an indoor ball within a very short period of time, which is why an indoor/outdoor ball is recommended for recreational players. Outdoor balls are commonly made from rubber to cope with rougher conditions, and they need to be filled with more air to retain a suitable level of air pressure in colder weather.\nSizes.\nDifferent sizes are used for different age groups. The common standards are:\nThe ball used for all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed) in the formal halfcourt game of 3x3 combines characteristics of the size 6 and size 7 balls. Its circumference is that of a size 6 ball, but its weight is that of a size 7.\nHistory.\nIn early December 1891, the chairman of the physical education department at the School for Christian Workers (Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, instructed physical education teacher James Naismith to invent a new game to entertain the school's athletes in the winter season. Naismith assembled his class of 18 young men, appointed captains of two nine-player teams, and set in motion the first-ever basketball game, played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets tacked to either end of the gymnasium.\nThe first purpose-built basketballs were made from panels of leather stitched together with a rubber bladder inside. A cloth lining was added to the leather for support and uniformity. A molded version of the early basketball was invented in 1942. For many years, leather was the material of choice for basketball coverings, however, in the late 1990s, synthetic composite materials were put forth and rapidly gained acceptance in most leagues, although the NBA's game balls still use real leather (apart from a brief experiment with a microfiber composite ball in 2006 that was not well received by the players).\nFrom 1967 through 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) used a distinctive red, white and blue basketball. It is used in the NBA's three point contest."
