        "text": "George Smith King, Jr. (August 16, 1928 – October 5, 2006) was an American professional basketball player and collegiate coach. He was born in Charleston, West Virginia.\nCollege career.\nGeorge King attended Morris Harvey College (now the University of Charleston), where he led his team to four NCAA championship tournaments. He averaged 31.2 points per game in 1950 and scored a total of 2,535 points in 117 games in his college career. He received his A.B. degree in physical education in 1950. In both his junior and senior years, he was named West Virginia's Amateur Athlete of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nGeorge King was picked in the 8th round of the 1950 NBA draft. He played for the Bartlesville Phillips 66ers in 1950–1951.\nIn 1955, King led the Syracuse Nationals to the Finals, where he hit the series-clinching free throw in Game 7 and had a key steal to win the championship. After five seasons with the Nationals, he spent his last season in the NBA with the Cincinnati Royals. He holds career averages of 10.3 points, 3.9 rebounds and 4.8 assists a game in six seasons.\nIn 1956, King toured eleven Middle East countries with the Nationals for the Educational Exchange Service of the State Department. A year later, he became the first American to give basketball coaching clinics in Africa.\nCollege coaching career.\nMorris Harvey College.\nAfter his tenure with the Nationals, King spent a season coaching college basketball at his alma mater, Morris Harvey, before returning for his last season in the NBA with the Royals.\nWest Virginia.\nGeorge King began his coaching career at West Virginia University as an assistant under head coach Fred Schaus. In 1961, he became the head coach after Schaus left for the chance to coach the Los Angeles Lakers. He coached the Mountaineers with an overall record of 102–43 and led them to three Southern Conference tournament championships and three NCAA tournaments.\nBefore King began his coaching career, he received his master's degree in physical education at WVU in 1957 (before he ended his NBA career).\nPurdue.\nKing moved on to coaching at Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he took over for Ray Eddy at the head coaching position. During his tenure, he compiled a 109–64 record. In 1969, he led the Boilermakers to their first Big Ten Championship in 29 years, and the first postseason appearance in school history. They made the most of it, advancing all the way to the NCAA title game, losing to John Wooden's UCLA. In that 1968–69 season, Purdue led the nation with 94.8 points a game on a team that consisted of notable players such as Rick Mount and Billy Keller. He was succeeded by his predecessor at West Virginia, Fred Schaus. He served as the school's athletic director from then on until 1992.\nFor the next 21 years as Purdue's seventh athletics director, King directed the Boilermaker program through a period of tremendous growth and change. He oversaw the emergence of women's athletics at the varsity level at Purdue in 1976–77. Extremely revered by his peers in the profession, King served as President of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA), and chairperson of the NCAA's prestigious Committee on Committees and the NCAA Postseason Bowl (now known as Special Events) committee.&lt;br&gt;\nHe was one of the youngest AD's in the nation and was the only one who also coached in the 1971–72 season. King is a member of both the Purdue and the University of Charleston Athletic Halls of Fame.\nLater years and death.\nKing received an honorary doctorate from the renamed University of Charleston in 1983, when he was also named recipient of a Distinguished Alumni Award. He was named to the prestigious Honors Committee of the National Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1982, and to the University of Charleston Athletic Hall of Fame in 1985. He also was honored as the recipient of NACDA's 1990 James J. Corbett Memorial Award.\nKing retired from Purdue in 1992 and was named to the school's Hall of Fame in 2001.\nKing died at the age of 78 at the Hospice of Naples in Naples, Florida, around 11:30 a.m. of October 5, 2006, surrounded by his family. He is survived by his spouse of 57 years, Jeanne G. King; children George, Kristy Jeanne, Kathy Jan, Kerry Jo and Gordon Scott; 18 grandchildren; nine great grandchildren; many nieces and nephews; and two sisters.\nCareer statistics.\nPlaying.\nNBA.\nSource"

        "title": "Mark Bomback (baseball)",
        "text": "Mark Vincent Bomback (born April 14, 1953) is a former professional baseball pitcher. Bomback played four Major League Baseball seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets and Toronto Blue Jays.\nMinor leagues.\nBomback was drafted in the 25th round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft by the Boston Red Sox. Over six seasons as a starting pitcher in the Bosox farm system, Bomback went 59–48 with a 4.21 earned run average and 681 strikeouts. He was released at the end of Spring training , and signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers shortly afterwards. After going 12–6 with a 4.53 ERA for the Holyoke Millers in 1977, he was able to bring his ERA down to 3.16 in , splitting his time between Holyoke and the triple A Spokane Indians.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nHe earned a call up to Milwaukee that September, and was hit hard in his major league debut against the Seattle Mariners. After striking out the first batter he faced, Bomback allowed a single, home run, another single and a double before he was able to retire another batter. When he walked the next batter, manager George Bamberger pulled him before he could complete an inning. He fared far better in his next appearance. Pitching a single inning of \"mop up duty\" against the Minnesota Twins, Bomback allowed one hit (to Hall of Famer Rod Carew), and retired the other three batters he faced.\nDespite putting together an impressive season with the triple A Vancouver Canadians (22-7, 2.56 ERA, 151 SO), Bomback never returned to the majors with the Brewers. After the season, he was traded to the New York Mets for fellow pitcher Dwight Bernard.\nNew York Mets.\nBomback was an early invite to Spring training, and earned a job in the Mets' bullpen to start the season. With Mets ace Pat Zachry beginning the season on the disabled list, Tom Hausman replaced Zachry in the starting rotation. Following a poor performance by Hausman against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 22, Bomback was given the opportunity to start despite three unimpressive relief appearances (5 earned runs in 5.2 innings pitched). He responded by holding the Phillies to one run over seven innings the very next day to record his first major league victory. In his next start, he pitched a two hit shutout against the Phillies.\nUpon Zachry's return, Bomback split time between starts and relief appearances. A July 29 victory over the Atlanta Braves, in which he held them scoreless through seven plus innings, marked his return to the starting rotation for the remainder of the season. A 4–1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on August 10 improved Bomback's record to 9–3 with a 3.83 ERA.\nFrom there, however, he faltered. He managed just one more win over the remainder of the season while losing five. For the season, he led the Mets staff with ten victories, and his eight losses were also the least among Mets starters. His 4.09 ERA was third behind Craig Swan and Ray Burris.\nDuring the off season, the Mets acquired former Cy Young Award winner Randy Jones. Coupled with the expected healthy return of Craig Swan, Bomback was squeezed out of the starting rotation. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays at the end of Spring training for a player to be named later (Charlie Puleo) as something of a favor to Bomback.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nBomback's career in Toronto got off to a good start. He was 3–1 with a 2.17 ERA following a May 3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. From there, things went south for Bomback, as he went 0–4 with a 5.53 ERA over his next seven starts to close out the first half of the strike shortened season at 3–5 with a 4.11 ERA. When play resumed following the strike, Bomback was used in relief. He went 2–0 with a 3.10 ERA.\nA strong Spring earned Bomback the opening day nod for the season. He would get tagged for six earned runs in just a third of an inning to log the worst opening day start in franchise history. A May 12 loss to the Chicago White Sox put his season record at 1–5 with a 6.86 ERA. He would make eight appearances in relief before being sent down to triple A Syracuse. He would pitch through with Syracuse, going 19–19 with a 3.75 ERA.\nCareer stats.\nBomback proved to be an exceptional hitting pitcher his one season in the National League. His first major league hit was an RBI double off former Met Tom Seaver of the Cincinnati Reds. On May 2, his fourth inning bunt off Silvio Martinez helped increased the Mets' lead over the Cardinals to 5–1. He then drove Martinez out of the game in the fifth with a double that drove in two. On July 19, he went 2-for-4 with two runs and two RBIs in the Mets' 10–4 victory over the Cards.\nIn , he pitched for the Winter Haven Super Sox of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.\nSources.\n, or The Ultimate Mets Database"

He was shifted to coach the running backs in 1997. Williams had a big role in the drafting of running back Duce Staley. Williams had scouted Staley at the University of South Carolina and recommended the Eagles pick him with their third-round pick in the 1997 NFL Draft. Staley went on to have a stellar career with the Eagles, accumulating 4,807 yards on 1,200 carries and 22 touchdowns along with 275 catches for 2,498 yards and 10 touchdowns. Williams was one of only four coaches kept on the coaching staff when Ray Rhodes was fired and replaced with Andy Reid.

He eventually found himself on the Amigos' active playing roster as the team struggled with finances and injuries.\nThe Anaheim Amigos were one of the least successful teams in the ABA. Attendance at their games was rumored to dip into double-digits, and the team ultimately lost about $500,000 before being sold and moved to Los Angeles. Injuries struck the Amigos towards the end of the 1967-68 season, but the team was so strapped financially that they could not sign any established basketballers as replacements. In order to have a full roster, team owner Art Kim decided to activate PR man Dick Lee as a player. Though Lee was not expected to receive any playing time, the Amigos coach was forced to use him in two games because Lee's teammates were in foul trouble. Playing at the forward position, Lee grabbed one rebound and is credited with one assist. Lee played college basketball at the University of Washington.\nSources.\nPluto, Terry. \"Loose Balls\".

        "text": "William “Ted” Cox (January 24, 1955 – March 11, 2020) was an American third baseman who played Major League Baseball from through for the Boston Red Sox (1977), Cleveland Indians (1978–1979), Seattle Mariners (1980) and Toronto Blue Jays (1981). He batted and threw right-handed.\nCareer.\nCox was selected by the Red Sox with the seventeenth pick in the first round of the 1973 draft, ahead of Fred Lynn. Listed at 6' 3\", 195 lb., Cox played five years in the Boston minor league system, stepping up a class every year, that was hastened by a phenomenal season in 1977 with Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. In 95 games, he hit .334 with 14 home runs and 81 RBI, which was highlighted by an All-Star selection, helping Pawtucket to clinch the regular season championship. After the season, he won both the Topps Minor League Player of the Year and the International League MVP awards, and was recalled by Boston in September 1977.\nCox debuted with the Red Sox on September 18, on Thanks Brooks Robinson Day at Baltimore. Cox went 4 for 4 plus a walk in his first major league game, a 10–4 Boston victory over the Orioles. After the game, reporters told Cox he had tied the American League record for most hits in a first game. Casey Stengel, Willie McCovey and Mack Jones also share the mark. Boston returned to Fenway Park to face the New York Yankees the next day. In his first at-bat against the Yankees, Cox hit a single to tie a record set in 1933 by Cecil Travis of the Washington Senators, of five consecutive hits at the start of a major league career. Then, in his second at-bat Cox singled off Ed Figueroa, giving him a 6 for 6 hitting streak.\nCox ended 1977 with a .362 average (21 for 58), and drew considerable attention to himself. Before the 1978 season he was traded by Boston along with Bo Díaz, Mike Paxton, and Rick Wise to the Cleveland Indians for Dennis Eckersley and Fred Kendall. After two years in Cleveland as a backup outfielder and playing all four infield positions, Cox joined the Seattle Mariners in 1980 and the Toronto Blue Jays in 1981, his last major league season.\nIn a five-season career, Cox was a .245 hitter with 10 home runs and 79 RBI in 272 games. On April 9, 1980, Cox became the first player in American League history to collect a game-winning RBI, a statistic that was official only from 1980 to 1988.\nLater life.\nAfter his playing career, Cox operated Grand Slam batting cages in Oklahoma City. In addition he was Oklahoma baseball director for the United States Specialty Sports Association. He was also an assistant baseball coach at Midwest City High School and Oklahoma City University. Cox worked with the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association to raise money for charities and civic causes.\nDeath.\nIn November 2019, Cox was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He died in Midwest City, Oklahoma, on March 11, 2020. Cox was survived by his mother Ernestine, wife Debbie (Pulliam) Cox and sons Billy and Joey.\nExternal links.\n or Pura Pelota"

Stone started 11 games at right defensive tackle, registering 49 tackles (5 for loss), one sack, 2 passes defensed and 2 blocked kicks.\nAs a senior, he was asked to convert into a right tackle to improve the offensive line depth. The line was nicknamed the \"All State Insurance\". He helped the offense rank 12th in the nation, averaging 233.5 rushing yards per game, rank 10th in total offense with an average of 438.4 yards per game and surrender only 12 sacks\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nStone was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (96th overall) of the 1993 NFL draft and was switched to play at offensive guard. He was activated for only 4 games as a rookie. The next year, he saw most of his playing time on the field goal and extra point lines.\nDuring his time with the team he was a backup at guard and tackle. In 1994, during a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, injuries forced him to play two different positions along the offensive line. Although he was a talented player and the top offensive line backup, he couldn't start ahead of the team's other offensive guards that included: Nate Newton, Larry Allen, Kevin Gogan, John Gesek and Derek Kennard. He was a part of 2 Super Bowl winning teams.\nNew York Giants.\nOn March 1, 1996, the New York Giants signed him as an unrestricted free agent, when the Cowboys couldn’t match an offer that would pay him, more than any of the Cowboy starter in the offensive line except for offensive tackle Erik Williams. The contract at the time was criticized, because it was seen as overpaying for a player that was not proven and had no starter experience.\nStone spent 6 seasons with the Giants as the starter at right guard, where he was named to 2 Pro Bowls and 2 All-Pro teams.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn April 12, 2002, he signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an unrestricted free agent. He was the starter at right guard and made the Pro Bowl in his first year, despite playing the entire season with a right arm brace. In a salary-cap move, he was released on March 2, 2004.\nOakland Raiders.\nOn March 8, 2004, he signed with the Oakland Raiders, reuniting with former offensive coordinator Norv Turner, who was now the head coach of the team. He only started 5 games because of a left knee injury and was placed on the injured reserve list on December 31. \nOn March 4, 2005, he was waived and later re-signed on March 10. After starting all 16 games in the previous season, he was released on March 2, 2006.\nPost-NFL.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, Stone became the offensive line coach for Valley Christian High School.\nPersonal life.\nStone has five children, 4 who are athletes in different sports. His son, Ron Stone Jr., was a linebacker for Washington State while his two daughters were athletes at the University of Oregon. His daughter Ronika played college volleyball while Ronna was a thrower on the track and field team. Ronnie did cheerleading. De`Ja is the eldest daughter. In 2020, Ronika began dating Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love."

        "text": "The Ladies Asian Tour is a women's professional golf tour established in 2022 and successor to the Ladies Asia Golf Circuit which ran 1983–2004 and the Ladies Asian Golf Tour which ran 2005–2021. The successive tours have been sanctioned by the Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation since its inception as an official Asian ladies' tour.\nBackground.\nBy 2005 there were five established women's professional tours in the world, of which two were in Asia, namely the LPGA of Japan Tour and the LPGA of Korea Tour. Japan and South Korea are two of the top three powers in women's professional golf, alongside the United States. The Ladies Asian Tour (LAT) is effectively a tour for the rest of Asia. This is comparable to the position in men's golf, where Japan has its own Japan Golf Tour and the rest of Asia has the Asian Tour. Most of the players on the tour come from Asia, but there are also representatives of various other parts of the world. Like the other major golf tours, LAGT has been a professional member of the International Golf Federation.\nHistory.\nLadies Asia Golf Circuit.\nBetween 1987–2003 the tour was known as the Kosaido Ladies Asia Golf Circuit as the main sponsor was the Kosaido Company of Japan, and prize money was in the range of $50,000–70,000. The company terminated its sponsorship due to the passing of its Chairman, Mr. Yoshiaki Sakurai in 2003. \nLadies Asian Golf Tour.\nIn 2005 the tour was reorganized as the Ladies Asian Golf Tour by Koichi Kato, and the first event after the restart was the Phuket Thailand Ladies Masters, which was played on 15-17 December 2005 with a $100,000 purse. In 2006 there were five tournaments with combined prize money of US$410,000, and five again in 2007, with total prize money of US$590,000. Between 2011 and 2014 most of the touräs events were co-sanctioned tournaments organized by the Taiwan LPGA Tour. With the only remaining tournaments of the tour, the Hong Kong Ladies Open and Hero Women's Indian Open, cancelled for several seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour's activity came to a halt.\nLadies Asian Tour.\nIn 2022, the Asian Golf Leaders Forum (AGLF) established a new Ladies Asian Tour (LAT) Series, which kicked off in June with the 36th Korea Women's Open. The LAT Series, through the Asia Pacific Golf Platform (APGP), organized seven tournaments across the Asia Pacific region in 2023, with plans to expand to 10 events in 2024.\nSchedule and results – Kosaido Ladies Asia Golf Circuit (1987–2004).\nSource:\nSchedule and results – Ladies Asian Golf Tour (2005–2021).\nSource:\nOrder of Merit winners.\nLadies Asian Golf Tour.\nSource:"

        "text": "Kevin Richard Long (born December 30, 1966) is an American former minor league baseball player and the current hitting coach for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has formerly served as the hitting coach for the New York Yankees (2007–14), New York Mets (2015–17) and Washington Nationals (2018–21).\nPlaying career.\nLong attended Thunderbird High School in Phoenix, Arizona. There, he played baseball, basketball, and football. In 1982, he was a bat boy during spring training for the Milwaukee Brewers. Long was coached by his father in youth baseball. He also earned MVP honors in the 1984 Babe Ruth League Southwest Regional tournament after hitting a game-winning grand slam one night and pitching out of a bases loaded, no outs jam to seal the victory the next.\nHe attended the University of Arizona, alongside future MLB players Trevor Hoffman, J.T. Snow, and Scott Erickson. Long was on the 1986 Arizona Wildcats team that won the NCAA Tournament. In 1989, he was named a second-team All-American and first-team Pac-10 and the Wildcats won the regular season conference title. A three-year letter-winner, Long still holds the Arizona record for most extra-base hits in a game (five) and ranks in the top 10 in extra-base hits, doubles, multi-hit games, total bases, and runs scored.\nLong was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 31st round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. That year, he led the Class-A Eugene Emeralds in games played, at-bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, and RBI. He also ranked eighth among all Northwest League hitters with his .312 batting average in his rookie season. He missed most of the 1994 season after undergoing surgery on his left wrist.\nCoaching career.\nAt the end of spring training in 1997, Long, who was assigned to the Triple-A Omaha Royals, decided to retire, asking instead for a coaching job. He made his professional managing debut with the Class-A Wilmington Blue Rocks. That year, he helped a young Carlos Beltran learn how to switch hit. He was named the Northwest League's co-Manager of the Year after leading the Spokane Indians to the league title in 1999.\nLong next served as the hitting coach for the Wichita Wranglers in Double-A. It was there that he and manager Keith Bodie developed Long's popular net drill, an exercise used to help players shorten their swing. In 2001, he used the drill to turn Brandon Berger into a 40-home run player. He the moved up to Triple-A as the hitting coach for the Omaha Royals. When he didn't get an opportunity in 2004 to interview for the job of hitting coach for the big league team, he moved to the New York Yankees organization. Long served as hitting coach for the Columbus Clippers in Triple-A from 2004 to 2006.\nLong was promoted to hitting coach for the New York Yankees in 2007. That year, the Yankees offense ranked first in MLB in runs (968), hits (1,656), home runs (201), RBI (929), team batting average (.290), slugging percentage (.463), on-base percentage (.366) and total bases (2,649). Long remained on the coaching staff after the Yankees hired Joe Girardi as manager for the 2008 season. \nUnder Long, the 2009 Yankees led the league in runs (915), hits (1,604), walks (663), home runs (244), RBI (881), OBP (.362), and slugging (.478) on their way to win the franchise's 27th World Series title. Following the 2010 season, the Yankees signed Long to a three-year contract. He was fired following the 2014 season.\nOn October 23, 2014, Long was hired by the New York Mets to be their hitting coach. In his first season there, the 2015 Mets won the National League pennant. Long helped turn Daniel Murphy into a power hitter; he hit seven homers in the 2015 postseason. He was a candidate for the open managerial position after the 2017 season, but was ultimately turned down in favor of Mickey Callaway. \nLong left the Mets and became the hitting coach of the Washington Nationals on November 2, 2017. The team then won the World Series in 2019. That year, the Nationals led the National League in batting average (.265) and on-base percentage (.342), and were in the top 10 in MLB in several other batting categories. \nOn October 13, 2021, Long left the Nationals to become the hitting coach of the Philadelphia Phillies, reuniting him with former Yankees manager Joe Girardi. The Phillies reached the World Series in 2022. On November 12, 2022, the Phillies signed Long to a two–year contract extension.\nPersonal life.\nWhen Long was still a player (though he does not remember which year), he suffered an accident during an offseason job with a drywall company, when a 25-pound sledgehammer hit him in the left eye, shattering three bones.\nLong resides in Scottsdale, Arizona with wife, Marcey, daughter, Britney, and sons Tracy and Jaron. Jaron Long played professional baseball in the Yankees and Nationals organizations.\nIn 2011, Long released a memoir entitled \"Cage Rat: Lessons from a Life in Baseball by the Yankees Hitting Coach\",\" where he detailed his approach to hitting."

He was drafted in the sixth round, 111th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. He played 137 games in the National Hockey League with the Sabres and four with the Hartford Whalers.\nPlaying career.\nParker was involved in two high-profile trades over the course of his career. Following his only complete NHL season, on the day of the 1990 entry draft the Sabres traded Parker to the Winnipeg Jets along with Phil Housley and Scott Arniel for Dale Hawerchuk and an exchange of draft picks seemingly in Buffalo's favour (which became Brad May and Keith Tkachuk). In an interview shortly after the trade, Parker stated \"I'm pretty happy with the trade, I'm looking forward to coming to Winnipeg because the Jets look like a team that's moving up the ladder.\"\nParker reported to Winnipeg Jets training camp in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on September 7, 1990, in poor physical condition and ranked low in the fitness tests taken on the first day of camp. He played 5 pre-season games with the Jets, scoring two goals and earning one assist. He and Simon Wheeldon were the last two players cut by the Jets that camp and on October 2, 1990, was assigned to the Moncton Hawks, the Jets farm team in the American Hockey League.\nDevastated about being assigned to the minors, Parker sat out most of the 1990–91 season until he was picked up by the Pittsburgh Penguins as a free agent in February 1991, only to be traded to Hartford along with John Cullen and Zarley Zalapski for Ron Francis, Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings on March 4, 1991. Parker only played four games for the Whalers before suffering from career-ending injuries. In his second game with the Whalers on March 12, 1991, against the Washington Capitals, he was checked into the boards and was knocked out for five minutes, resulting in a concussion. He returned to the Whalers two weeks later before sustaining a season-ending knee injury against his former team, the Sabres.\nIn his 141-game NHL career, Parker scored 16 goals and 19 assists for a total of 35 points.\nDeath.\nParker died in Minneapolis on September 11, 2017, from complications of heart and lung infections. He was 53 years old. His brain was donated to Boston University to aid in chronic traumatic encephalopathy research. On May 3, 2018, it was reported that Parker had CTE when he died."

West Indies also played one match in Ireland in July.\nHaving drawn the 1973-74 series in the West Indies, England started the series in confident mood, with their captain Tony Greig proclaiming before TV cameras that England would make West Indies \"grovel\".\nGreig was never allowed to forget that comment, although in a subsequent interview many years later he recounted that his comment was born out of frustration with the journalist interviewing him at Hove in early season 1976. Greig felt that the interviewer was concentrating too much on the West Indies fast bowling attack and not discussing England's strengths. Even in an interview with Sky Sports \"Saturday Story\" only around a year before Greig died, he was prepared to apologise on camera for his remark - even some 35 years after he had originally made it.\nThe international matches were dominated by the West Indies, captained by Clive Lloyd. England struggled against the batting of Gordon Greenidge and Viv Richards and the pace bowling of Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Vanburn Holder and Wayne Daniel. Richards smashed 829 runs in four Tests, but missed the 2nd Test due to illness. Impressive individual performances for England included centuries for Tony Greig and Alan Knott in the 4th Test, a double century by Dennis Amiss in the 5th Test, and the bowling of John Snow, Bob Willis and Derek Underwood.\nIn last test played at the Oval, Richards plundered 291 runs and his second double ton of the series, this remained his highest test score. During the innings he surpassed Garfield Sobers' record of six test tons in a calendar year by scoring his seventh. He also scored 1710 runs in a calendar year which remained as a world record till 2006.\nThe highlights of the tour were five Test matches and three One Day Internationals against the English cricket team. After the first two Tests were drawn, giving England a false sense of hope, the West Indies easily won the remaining three Tests to take the five-match Test series 3–0, and retain the Wisden Trophy. West Indies also won all 3 of the ODIs.\nWest Indies also played numerous matches against the first-class counties and other minor teams.\nForm.\nWest Indies.\nThe West Indies arrived in England with a new approach to cricket, particularly bowling. During the 1975–1976 season, the West Indies team was thrashed 5–1 in Australia, unable to cope with the home side's fast arm bowlers like Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee. In response, captain Clive Lloyd completely transformed the West Indies team with a focus on fast bowling. The new West Indies style debuted that same winter in 1975 when the West Indies hosted India. The West Indies won the series 2–1. However, the victory was a result of India choosing to withdraw their final batsmen in response to what they described as barbaric, reckless, and dangerous West Indies' bowling.\nEngland.\nThe England cricket team had enjoyed a long spell of success in the early 1970s with consecutive victories in The Ashes and a strong record against other international opponents. However, defeats in 1975 to Australia in the Cricket World Cup and in The Ashes had exposed the team as possibly ageing and lacking top-class fast bowlers.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nAfter the traditional opening fixture against Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk's XI, and warm-up matches against county sides, the 1st Test was played at Trent Bridge at the beginning of June.\nEngland's Mike Brearley and West Indian Larry Gomes made their Test debuts. West Indies won the toss and batted through most of the first two days to score 494 all out. Viv Richards made the top score of 232, supported in a third wicket stand of 303 by Alvin Kallicharran, who made 97. However, having reached 408–2, the West Indies displayed some batting vulnerability, and the last 8 wickets fell for 86 runs, Derek Underwood taking 4-82.\nEngland made a solid reply, scoring 332, including 106 for David Steele and 82 for Bob Woolmer, and Wayne Daniel taking 4-53. Richards hit a brisk 63 in the West Indies second innings of 176-5 declared. Facing a victory target of 339, England batted out the last day for a draw, with England opening batsman John Edrich undefeated on 76 at the close.\nSecond Test.\nThe 2nd Test was played at Lord's two weeks later. Richards was unfit, and was replaced by bowler Raphick Jumadeen; Michael Holding played in place of Daniel. England also made two changes, with Barry Wood for Edrich and Pat Pocock for Mike Hendrick.\nEngland won the toss and batted, scoring 250, with Roberts taking 5-60. West Indies opening batsman Gordon Greenidge scored 84 and captain Clive Lloyd 50, but Underwood took 5-39 and John Snow 4-68, to bowl West Indies out in 50.4 overs for only 182 on the second day. The third day was washed out, but England batted through the fourth day and were finally bowled out for 254 at the start of the fifth day, with Roberts taking his second 5-wicket haul in the match (5-63). Needing 323 to win, West Indies reached 241-6 by the close, with 138 to Roy Fredericks, and the match was drawn.\nThird Test.\nAfter a gap of three weeks, the 3rd Test was played at Old Trafford in the second week of July. With the series still at 0–0 with three to play, West Indies won the toss and again chose to bat.\nThree early wickets for debutant Mike Selvey and one for the returned Mike Hendrick saw the West Indies on the back foot at 26–4, but Greenidge (134) and debutant Collis King (32) recovered the position to a relatively respectable 211 all out. The West Indian first innings was put into perspective as Holding (5-17), Roberts (3-22), and Daniel (2-13) ripped through the England batting, dismissing them for 71 in 32.5 overs. Steele (20) was the only England batsman to reach double figures, and the only one to beat the extras.\nWest Indies dominated from the start of their second innings, with century stands for the first three wickets, between Fredericks (50) and Greenidge (101), Greenidge and Richards (135), Richards and Lloyd (43). West Indies declared on 411-5 near the end of the third day, leaving England to score 552 to win, or, more likely, to bat out two days to secure a draw. England survived for 63.5 overs. Rain interrupted play on the fourth day, but England were all out for 126 twenty balls into the last day. Edrich top scored on 24, but was unable to beat extras (25). West Indies won by 425 runs.\nFourth Test.\nNow 1-0 down, England needed to win the 4th Test, which began at Headingley two weeks later, to recover the Wisden Trophy. England's Chris Balderstone and Peter Willey both made their Test debuts.\nBatting first, Greenidge (115) and Fredericks (109) both hit quick centuries in an opening stand of 192. Richards (66) and Lawrence Rowe (50) both added half-centuries, and West Indies were bowled out for 450 early on the second day, Snow taking 4-77 and Bob Willis 3-71. England were soon in trouble at 80–4, but captain Tony Greig and wicket-keeper Alan Knott added 152 for the sixth wicket, each making 116 in a sixth-wicket stand of 152. England were bowled out for 387, only 63 behind. West Indies lost quick wickets, and Willis took 5–42 to wrap up the tail. West Indies were bowled out for 196 in 51.3 overs. Set a target of 260 to win, Roberts (3-41), Holding (3-44) and Daniel (3-60) bowled England out for 204 in 56 overs. Greig was unbeaten on 76, to add to his first-innings century, but West Indies won by 55 runs.\nFifth Test.\nEngland had lost the series, but could recover some pride by winning the 5th Test played on a very dry pitch at the Oval in mid-August.\nWest Indies batted for most of the first two days to score a monumental 687–8. Richards reached 291, his second double century of the series. Nine of England's 11 players were given a bowl, save only the recalled Dennis Amiss and wicket-keeper Knott. The opening fast bowlers, Willis and Selvey, were quickly consigned to the outfield, bowling only 15 overs each; Underwood bowled 60.5 overs, with 27 from debutant spinner Geoff Miller and another 34 and 17 overs added by the occasional spin bowling of captain Greig and Chris Balderstone respectively. England replied with a creditable 435, including 203 for Amiss and 50 for Knott. Holding dominated the bowling, taking 8-92, all but one of them bowled or lbw. Despite taking a first-innings lead of 252, West Indies declined to enforce the follow-on. Instead, Greenidge (86*) and Fredericks (85*) scored quick runs, adding 182 in a 32-over unbroken opening partnership, and West Indies declared on 182 for no wicket late on the fourth day, leaving England a target of 435 for victory. Holding took 6-57, giving him a match total of 14–149, as England were bowled out for 203. Knott top scorer on 57, his second half-century of the match. West Indies won the match by 231 runs, and the Test series 3–0.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nThe West Indies won the Prudential Trophy 3–0.\n1st ODI.\nIn the 1st ODI, West Indies won the toss and put England in to bat, with ODi debuts for England's Graham Barlow, Ian Botham, Graham Gooch, John Lever and David Steele, and West Indies' Michael Holding and Collis King. Hostile bowling by Roberts (4-32) and Holding (2-38) restricted England to 202–8, Barlow top scoring on 80 not out. England were unable to stop Richards in the West Indian reply. He scored an unbeaten 119 off 133 balls to win the match with 14 overs to spare, and became man of the match.\n2nd ODI.\nEngland put West Indies in at the 2nd ODI, reduced to 50 overs due to rain. Richards again scored heavily, with 97 off 96 balls, but West Indies were unable to bat out their overs, scoring 221 all out off 47.5 overs, with the spinners taking most of the wickets. Despite 88 from ODI debutant Derek Randall, the West Indian bowling, particularly Roberts (4-27), again dominated. Further weather interruptions pushed the match into the reserve day, when West Indies won by 36 runs. Richards was again man of the match.\n3rd ODI.\nPlay was impossible on 30 August, but the match began on the reserve day, limited this time to only 32 overs. England again put West Indies in to bat, and Fredericks and Richards were quickly out, Richards for a duck. However, runs from Greenidge (42), Lloyd (79) and Rowe (45) saw West Indies to 223 for 9. After a good start, with an opening partnership of 54 between Wood and Amiss, England were bowled out for 173 in 31.4 overs, with Vanburn Holder taking 5-50, and West Indies won by 50 runs. Lloyd was man of the match.\nControversy.\nOn 2 June 1976, the eve of the first test match of the series, England captain Tony Greig was interviewed on BBC’s midweek sports program Sportsnight. The interview was conducted on the roof of Hove’s Pavilion in Sussex. In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, \"I like to think that people are building these West Indians up, because I am not really sure they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve got a couple of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel. And I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.” The insensitive comments only inflamed the racial and colonial implications surrounding the 1976 series. The remark was particularly provocative coming from Greig, the white South African-born captain of England.\nWest Indian bowler, Michael Holding recalled how the comment “Smacked of racism and Apartheid. He got our backs up and made us more determined.” Greig claimed the word \"grovel\" was used only as a response to the way the interviewer had been discrediting the England team as major underdogs in the match-up. When asked about the remark prior to the first test, the West Indian captain Clive Lloyd gave Greig the benefit of the doubt surrounding the use of the word \"grovel\". Lloyd however declared being furious about how Greig had patronizingly characterized the West Indies team as unprofessional and nonchalant Calypso cricketers.\nDuring the final match at The Oval as defeat became imminent for the English side, Greig kneeled down on to the pitch smiling and performed a ‘grovel’ crawl on the ground. The act of contrition was received with applause from a large portion of the West Indians fans present that had been previously taunting the England captain. The West Indies batsman Viv Richards remarked “In other words, he was going to have us down on our knees, begging for mercy! This was the greatest motivating speech the England captain could have given to any West Indian team.”\nLegacy.\nThe West Indies victory in the 1976 series was the first of seven consecutive wins over England. The 1976 series also helped salvage the then financially struggling Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB). The series generated £950,000 for the TCCB, forty percent more than The Ashes of 1975 had produced in revenue. For the next two decades, the West Indies cricket would dominate international cricket, after 1979 not losing a series for fifteen years. The 1976 series has been characterized as a turning point for the West Indies cricket team. The series revealed to the cricketing world a new generation of West Indian cricket superstars like Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd, and Michael Holding. The victory exposed the West Indies team as a group of world-class cricketers who had developed into a major threat in international cricket.\nBook.\nThe 1976 series has been memorialized by David Tossel's “Grovel: The story and legacy of the summer of 1976.” Published in 2007, the book provides an in depth depiction of the series and its significance to West Indies' cricket and to the sport of cricket in general. The book also features a collection of action photos of the match proceedings.\nFilm.\nThe 1976 test series between the West Indies and England also features in Stevan Riley’s 2010 British documentary Fire in Babylon. A whole chapter of the film is devoted to the 1976 series. The documentary highlights the significance of the summer of 1976 in England, and its impact on West Indies cricket and the West Indian community in England in the 1970s."

        "title": "Lake surfing",
        "text": "Lake surfing is surfing on any lake with sufficient surface area for wind to produce waves. As with ocean surfing, ideal wave conditions are when the wind switches offshore. However, when this occurs over a lake the waves generated by previous onshore wind subside relatively quickly. This means lake surfers have a shorter window of opportunity to surf ideal waves. Lake surfers are often out during and experiencing the same storm that creates the waves whereas ocean surfers are more often surfing on swell produced by storms hundreds of miles away and that may have taken days to reach shore. In addition to making it more difficult to manage surfboards, high winds can make the face of a wave and water surface rough. Increased wave frequency due to shorter fetch results in less rest between waves and sets of waves. This can make it necessary to paddle out through waves because there may not be a long enough pause between sets to paddle out between them.\nThough not significant enough to necessitate surfboard design changes, the reduced buoyancy of fresh water results in increased drag when paddling. Lake surfers enjoy water that is fresh (\"sweet\" as opposed to salty) and do not have to worry about the dangers from marine life (e.g. sharks, jellyfish, etc.) that ocean surfers may have to contend with.\nLakes where surfing is possible include the Great Lakes on the United States–Canada border and Lake Tahoe on the California–Nevada border.\nGreat Lakes.\nStrong storms, particularly in the winter and fall (at which time they may be referred to as a November Witch), can produce large waves on the Great Lakes in North America. During these surf seasons, there is often snow, shelf ice, and some ice in the water, making access difficult and conditions more dangerous. Dedicated surfers wear wetsuits or drysuits to keep warm. The surface water temperature when much Great Lakes surfing occurs averages between .\nSheboygan, Wisconsin, featured in surf films and referred to as the Malibu of the Midwest, hosted an annual Dairyland Surf Classic on Labor Day weekend from 1988 to 2012, which was the largest lake surfing competition in the world.\nGreat Lakes surfing has grown in popularity over the past decade thanks to the advances in wetsuit and or drysuits technology and the proliferation of information on the internet. There are small surf communities all around the Great Lakes, and medium-sized communities in larger cities such as Toronto and Chicago. Local community organizations such as Great Lakes Surfer's Journal, Surfrider Foundation Milwaukee and Surf the Greats are intended to nurture these communities, protect shorelines, and to raise awareness of Great Lakes surfing."

        "text": "Wayne Jones (born 24 April 1965) is an English professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments. He uses the nickname The Wanderer for his matches.\nCareer.\nJones started his career in the British Darts Organisation in the late 1980s and reached the final of the British Open in 1990 (losing to Alan Warriner and the British Classic in 2000 (losing to Ritchie Davies) - but his best achievement was reaching the final of the prestigious Winmau World Masters in 1999 when Andy Fordham ended his hopes of a first major title.\nHe didn't make it to the Lakeside Country Club for the BDO World Championship until 2001, losing to Andy Fordham in the second round. He made it to the quarter-finals of the 2002 event by beating Tony Eccles and Ted Hankey but lost 1–5 to Martin Adams.\nHe then switched to the PDC and made his debut at their version of the World Championship in 2004. In 2006 he produced his best ever World Championship performance by reaching the semi-finals before losing to Peter Manley. In August 2010, he made his first PDC televised final appearance in the European Championships, losing to Phil Taylor. However this had guaranteed him a place in the Grand Slam of Darts in his home town of Wolverhampton in 2010 and 2011. At the 2010 tournament he produced quite a big upset in the quarter-finals by beating Scotland's number one Gary Anderson, having trailed throughout the match, his never give up attitude earning him the last three legs to take victory 16–15 in a thriller. By reaching the semi-finals of this competition where he lost to James Wade, it also guaranteed himself a place in the Grand Slam of darts for an extra year in 2012. He was beaten by James Wade in the semi-finals.\nIn 2012 he reached the last 16 of the PDC World Championship for the first time since 2006. He comfortably beat Scott MacKenzie and Roland Scholten, before being whitewashed, 0–4, to defending champion Adrian Lewis. At the Dutch Darts Masters, Jones produced an upset by beating Phil Taylor 6–5 en route to the quarter-finals, before losing to Paul Nicholson in the semi-finals. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Jones was 32nd in the Order of Merit, gaining the final spot for the Players Championship Finals. He produced a big shock by whitewashing number one seed Dave Chisnall 6–0 in the first round, before bowing out of the tournament 7–10 to Peter Wright.\nJones lost in the first round of the 2013 World Championship to Dutchman Jerry Hendriks 3–0, after being narrowly edged out of each set by two legs to three. He was whitewashed 5–0 by James Wade in the second round of the UK Open. Jones reached his first semi-final on the Pro Tour in almost a year in September's eighth Players Championship but was beaten 6–1 by Ian White. He continued his form by reaching another semi later in the month at the German Darts Masters in a run which included wins over Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson, before Mervyn King beat him 6–4. His recent surge in form saw him qualify for the World Grand Prix, where he faced King again and this time beat him by two sets to nil. Jones won the first set of his next match against Dave Chisnall but lost 3–1. Jones was involved in a deciding leg in the first round of the Players Championship Finals and left 36 only for his opponent Brendan Dolan to take out 126 on the bull to defeat him 6–5.\nJones lost 3–2 to Kevin McDine in the first round of the 2014 World Championship as he missed a total of 26 darts at doubles during the match. He dropped out of the top 32 on the Order of Merit afterwards as he was ranked number 33. Jones suffered a surprise 5–3 defeat to Jason Hogg in the second round of the UK Open. The only other major event Jones could qualify for during the year was the World Matchplay where he lost 10–3 to Andy Hamilton in the first round. He failed to advance beyond the last 16 of any event during 2014.\nAt the 2015 World Championship, Jones took a 2–1 set advantage over Dean Winstanley but lost the final two sets by three legs to one in a 3–2 defeat. It was his third first round exit in a row at the event. Jones lost in the second round of the UK Open 5–2 to Joey ten Berge. Three last 16 exits were the furthest he progressed in any tournament in 2015. Jones qualified for the Grand Slam, but lost each of his group fixtures against Michael Smith, Andy Fordham and Adrian Lewis.\nJones had played in every World Championship since 2005, but failed to qualify for the 2016 edition as he had dropped outside the last 32 on the Order of Merit, failed to win enough money on the Pro Tour and lost in the quarter-finals of the qualifier. A fifth successive second round exit in the UK Open occurred after he lost 6–5 to Andy Jenkins. His first quarter-final since 2013 came at the seventh Players Championship courtesy of defeating Ross Smith 6–1, Simon Whitlock 6–3, Vincent van der Voort 6–0 and Ian White 6–1. However, Jones lost 6–2 to Dave Chisnall. Jones dropped out of the top 64 during the year and played in Q School to try and earn a new Tour Card. He reached the last 32 on the third day, but over the course of event he did not win enough points and will not be able to play in the full schedule of PDC events in 2017.\nHowever, Jones won back his tour card in 2018 after topping the Challenge Tour Order of Merit in 2017, which gave him another two years on the full PDC Circuit. Jones qualified for the 2019 PDC World Darts Championship, his first world championship in four years, as a qualifier on the ProTour Order of Merit. He drew the South-African born Devon Petersen in the first round. Jones went 2-0 down in sets but managed to level the match at 2-2, however Jones then missed six match darts in a last leg decider and lost the match 3–2 in sets.\nWayne Jones lost his Tour Card at the end of 2021 &amp; Didn't manage to win it back at 2022 PDC Q School.

        "text": "The American Samoa national rugby union team, also known as the \"Talavalu\", represents the American Samoa Rugby Union in international rugby union. As of September 2023, it is the lowest ranked World Rugby team.\nThe Talavalu is the name of a traditional Samoan war weapon, originally carved out of ironwood. As can be seen on the right side of the American Samoa Rugby Union logo, it resembles a club but has eight diamond-shaped teeth carved on one edge. Translated, \"tala\" is teeth, and \"valu\" is eight.\nHistory.\nNational development of rugby union in American Samoa has been overshadowed by the popularity of American football since the 1970s. Unlike neighbouring Samoa, American Samoa has had limited international rugby competition. Most of American Samoa's matches have been played at the South Pacific Games.\nAmerican Samoa's first international 15's match was at the 1983 South Pacific Games in Apia, where they lost 55–0 to Western Samoa (as it was then called). They did not make the final stages of that tournament. American Samoa fared much better at the 1991 South Pacific Games in Port Moresby, notching up wins against Solomon Islands and French Polynesia. While they lost 34–7 to Western Samoa in the final, the American Samoans won the rugby 15's silver medal.\nThe South Pacific Games (now called the Pacific Games) subsequently switched to hosting rugby 7s in preference to rugby 15s, and the ASRU, while still eligible for the FORU Oceania Cup, turned more of its attention toward the seven-a-side form of the game. American Samoa competed at the Pacific Games Rugby 7s in 2011, and the Oceania Rugby 7s in 2011 and 2012.\nIn 2015 the Talavalu made their first appearance at the Oceania Rugby Cup. They won their first match against the Solomon Islands 30–15. In their second game, they lost to Papua New Guinea 36–22. Their third game against Tahiti was also a loss, 8–20. The Talavalu's finished the tournament in third place.\nDiaspora.\nDue to limited opportunities at home, notable American Samoan players have been selected in other national teams instead of American Samoa. Frank Solomon was the pioneer, playing for in the 1930s; and Jerome Kaino was a key member of New Zealand's Rugby World Cup-winning teams in 2011 and 2015.\nAmerican Samoans that have represented include Mose Timoteo, Valenise Malifa, the Suniula brothers (Andrew, Roland and Shalom) and Junior Sifa.\nRecent Squad.\nSquad for the 2015 Oceania Rugby Cup:\nManagement"

Support, but not funding, from the government was gained for the national team. Shortly after they were played in their first African Tournament.

Mauritius is a member of World Rugby, but the national team is ranked as third tier, and Mauritius have yet to compete in either the Africa Cup or Rugby World Cup.\nRugby Union Mauritius represents Mauritius internationally and is member of CAR (Confederation Africaine de Rugby), AROI (Association de Rugby Ocean Indien), World Rugby and FIT (Federation of International Touch).\nThe national side is ranked 91st in the world (as of 29 January 2024).\nHistory.\nIntroduced by the English Army (Colonial Time 1810 to 1968 Independence) Rugby started in the early 1900s in Mauritius. The game was then introduced to the Franco-Mauritians by a group of rugby players who created the Dodo Club in 1928 which enhanced the start of Rugby competition on the island. From 1928 to 1975 rugby was played at senior level between various clubs remembered as the Buffalos, HMS Mauritius, Blue Ducks, Dodo, the Navy, SMF and the Stags.\nStags and the Dodo remained active and competed against one another resulting in the closure of the Stags in 1982. The Dodo Club remained the only active club which carried on developing the passion and culture of this sport, but unfortunately due to the retreat of the Dodo Club in all sports at national level, there was a need to phase out rugby from this club in order to develop the sport at a regional level.\nDuring these times, many youngsters went to boarding schools in South-Africa and England. Others went to university in South-Africa, England, France and Australia, and when they came back to Mauritius on holidays, there was a need to play rugby and show their friends that they did not only study overseas. This created an enthusiastic rugby atmosphere which led to traditional games between The Students and local players.\nBetween 1992 and 2001 various tours were organised to Reunion Island participating to seven a side tournaments and XV rugby.\nWe participated in the Kenya Safaris Sevens in 1996 and 1997.\nIn 1995, during the third rugby World Cup in South Africa, six games were broadcast for the first time on Mauritian TV. 1996 saw the birth of the Mauritian Seven a side Tournament with 4 Teams. In 1997 we started a development program in schools which led to the creation of three coaching centres in different parts of the island in 2003.\nIn 1998, the Stags Club was re-created and thus triggered the thought that rugby had a place in the Mauritian Sport and the potential needed to be exploited. Mauritius rugby needed to be given a chance and the means for development at a national level. After three years of competition with clubs from surrounding countries and more players getting attracted by the rugby fever leading to an increasing demand for the creation of new clubs, three new regions/clubs were created in 2001 : The Curepipe Starlights, the Northern Pirates and the Western Cowboys.\nToday we have 4 Clubs in Division A and 6 Clubs in Division B, 3 Coaching Centres, around 650 licensed members, 18 Coaches, 6 Referees, National Sides in Senior (7s &amp; XV) Under 18 (7s). Players are coming from all over the island and from all the communities to play Rugby. Rugby is starting to develop through the CSR for all the vulnerable groups and in all the rural areas as Black River, La Gaulette, Petite Riviere Noire, La Source, Quatre Bornes, Roches Bois and the north of the island.\nCompetitions.\nThe National Team has been participating in AROI and CAR competitions as follows :-\nAfrica cup 1B in Uganda. 2015. \nAfrica cup 1c in Botswana 2014. - winner\nUntil 2010 RUM was in Africa Cup Division 2 and since 2011, played in first Division Group D and won it.

        "text": "The Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Michigan State University. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I college basketball. The Spartans have won two NCAA championships and 16 Big Ten Championships. Their home games are played at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center (\"Breslin Center\") in East Lansing, Michigan. Tom Izzo has been the head coach since 1995. \nTheir two national championships came in the 1979 NCAA tournament and the 2000 NCAA tournament. The 1979 national championship game was the most watched college basketball game in history, with 35.11 million television viewers. The 1979 National Championship team was coached by Jud Heathcote and included tournament MVP Magic Johnson, Greg Kelser, and Jay Vincent. The Spartans defeated the previously unbeaten Indiana State, led by future Hall of Famer Larry Bird. The 2000 National Championship team defeated Florida in the final. The team was coached by Tom Izzo and led by players Morris Peterson, Charlie Bell, Jason Richardson, and tournament MVP Mateen Cleaves.\nThe Spartans have participated in 37 NCAA tournaments (tied for 10th-most all-time) and appeared in 26 consecutive NCAA tournaments (the 2020 NCAA tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the third-longest streak ever and the longest active streak in college basketball. Michigan State has the sixth most all-time Final Four appearances with 10 (1957, 1979, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2019). The program is also ninth all-time in NCAA tournament winning percentage (.686, through 2023). Michigan State also has 14 NCAA Elite Eights (10th-most all-time),and 21 NCAA Sweet Sixteens (7th-most all-time).\nTeam history.\n1898–1954: early years.\nThe first established coach for Michigan Agricultural College (MSU's name at the time), Charles Bemies was also the first athletic director in school history, while also coaching the football, baseball, and track teams. His two-year stint as basketball head coach ended in 1901. MAC's second basketball coach was George Denman. Denman is the only basketball coach to go undefeated during his tenure, posting an 11–0 mark during his two seasons. His team still holds the record for largest margin of victory with a 102–3 defeat of Alma College in 1902. MAC's first full-time athletic director and one of the Spartan's most successful coaches, Chester Brewer led the football, basketball, and baseball squads to winning records. He holds the highest winning percentage of any Spartan basketball coach with at least four seasons at .736 (70–25). His team also defeated Michigan in the schools’ first meeting in 1909. George Gauthier was the first alumnus to lead a Michigan State basketball squad. He compiled a career record of 41–38 over four seasons. Gauthier left after 29 games in 1919– 20, posting a 15–14 record. Lyman Frimodig coached the final seven games of the season, going 6–1. He would also serve as head coach for the next two seasons. He remained active in the athletic department after his stint as basketball coach, serving Michigan State for 41 years as assistant athletic director and business manager\nBenjamin Van Alstyne coached MSU for 22 years from 1926 to 1949. He is third in career victories with 231. Van Alstyne coached MSU's first All-American, Roger Grove, in 1930. Some of his greatest victories included a 27–26 victory over Michigan in 1930 at the dedication of Demonstration Hall, and a 66–50 upset over Kentucky in 1945 that was named “Coca-Cola Upset of the Week.” His 47–45 loss to Kentucky in 1948 set the record for the largest crowd in Jenison Field House history.\nIn one season under Alton Kircher, the Spartans finished 4–18. Following the conclusion of the 1950 season, the Spartans would join the Big Ten Conference.\nPete Newell was hired from San Francisco following a successful four years with the Dons where he went 70–37 and won the 1949 NIT.\nHis 1951–52 squad was the first ranked Spartan team and also registered a win over No. 14 Notre Dame, the first win over a ranked opponent in school history. One of his biggest wins was a 1952 defeat of No. 2-ranked Kansas State. After four seasons, California hired Newell as its head coach and MSU had to search for another coach. Newell is often considered to be one of the most influential figures in the history of basketball.\n1954–1965: Forrest \"Forddy\" Anderson era.\nForrest \"Forddy\" Anderson was hired away from Bradley following a trip to the 1954 Final Four with the Braves. His Bradley team had also made it to the 1950 championship game.\nTwo years after taking over the Spartans, in 1957, he led MSU to its first Big Ten Championship. After opening the season with a 4–7 record, the Spartans won 10 in a row and 12-of-13 to capture their first league title and advance to the school's first NCAA tournament. A bye in the first round of the Tournament preceded wins over Notre Dame and Kentucky to earn a trip to the Final Four. A loss to North Carolina in the Final Four left MSU in the national third-place game where they lost to San Francisco.\nTwo years later, led by All-American Johnny Green, the Spartans cruised to a Big Ten Championship, winning the league by four games. A win over Marquette in the 1959 NCAA tournament put MSU in the Mideast regional finals against Kentucky. The Spartans lost and fell one game short of another trip to the Final Four.\nFollowing his initial successes in East Lansing, his Spartan teams only finished with a winning record one time after 1959. He was fired following the 1964–65 season.\n1965–1976: post-Anderson era.\nJohn Benington, who had been an assistant to Anderson at Bradley before joining his staff at MSU, took over as head coach, and led MSU to a second-place Big Ten finish in his first season at the helm. The next season, he led the Spartans to a shared Big Ten title, but Indiana received the NCAA tournament bid (at that time, only one Big Ten team received an NCAA bid). After four seasons leading the Spartans, he died of a heart attack after jogging at Jenison Fieldhouse in the summer of 1969 at the age of 47.\nGus Ganakas was an assistant under Benington and was hired to take over following Benington's death. His most successful seasons were in 1973–74 with a fourth-place Big Ten finish and 1974–75 with a 17–9 overall record. In 1975, 10 black members of his team walked out before a game against Indiana for what was perceived at the time as a racial disagreement over starting a white player. Ganakas was fired in 1976, but he continued to be a part of the Michigan State Athletics Department, serving as an assistant A.D. and then as an aide to coach Tom Izzo from 1998 to 2000. He was an MSU basketball radio announcer until 2017. He died in 2019.\n1976–1995: Jud Heathcote era.\nJud Heathcote was hired to take over as coach in 1976 from Montana by athletic director Joseph Kearney in May 1976, after coaching the Grizzlies for five years. Heathcote had led the Grizzlies to two Big Sky championships and the 1975 NCAA tournament, the Grizzlies first ever trip to the Tournament. He finished his tenure at Montana with an 80–53 record.\nAs a virtual unknown, Heathcote came to East Lansing looking to return MSU to greatness. In his second year, he landed one of the game's all-time greats, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, from nearby Lansing Everett High School, as a recruit. The 1977–78 Spartans won the Big Ten title, their first since 1967, and qualified for the NCAA tournament for only the third time in school history. They advanced to the Elite Eight and were led by Johnson and Greg Kelser. In 1979, the duo led the Spartans to a second consecutive Big Ten title and the NCAA National Championship. The NCAA championship marked the school's first in basketball.\nFollowing the championship, Johnson left school to join the NBA and Kelser graduated. The result was a ninth place finish in the Big Ten the next year and struggles thereafter. MSU returned to postseason play in 1983, finishing with a 17–13 record and receiving an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament.\nFollowing the expansion of the NCAA tournament to 64 teams in 1985, Heathcote returned the Spartans, led by the future MSU all-time scoring leader, Scott Skiles, to the Tournament with a fifth-place finish in the Big Ten. MSU again reached the NCAA tournament the following year after finishing third in the Big Ten with a 23–8 record. Led by Skiles and Darryl Johnson, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing.\nHeathcote returned MSU to postseason play in 1989, led by Steve Smith, losing the third-place game of the NIT. Smith returned the Spartans to the NCAA tournament in 1990 as a No. 1 seed. The Spartans narrowly avoided losing to No. 16-seeded Murray State, needing overtime to advance to the second round. They again narrowly advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to Georgia Tech in overtime. The Spartans also made an appearance in the 1991 NCAA tournament. The Spartans finished in third place in Big Ten play and received an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed to the Tournament where they beat Green Bay on a buzzer beater by Smith. In the second round, they lost to No. 10 Utah in double overtime.\nThe Spartans made their third straight trip to the NCAA tournament in 1992. Another third-place finish in Big Ten play resulted in an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed to the NCAA tournament. There they beat Missouri State before losing to Cincinnati in the second round in a rematch of an earlier Spartan win.\nA trip to the NIT in 1993 broke the NCAA tournament streak, but Heathcote again led MSU to the NCAA tournament in 1994. A fourth-place finish the Big Ten led to an at-large bid to the Tournament as a No. 7 seed. Led by Shawn Respert, they beat Seton Hall in the first round before losing to second-seeded Duke in the second round.\nIn his final year at MSU in 1995, Heathcote returned the Spartans to the NCAA tournament for the fifth time in six years. A second-place finish in Big Ten play resulted in an at-large bid to the Tournament as a No. 3 seed where they were surprised by No. 14-seeded Weber State in the first round. The game marked the final game of All-American Shawn Respert's career at MSU.\nHeathcote stepped down in 1995 after 19 seasons at Michigan State. He finished with nine NCAA appearances, three Big Ten championships and three NIT appearances. He hand-picked his successor, Tom Izzo. \"I had to orchestrate the hiring of Tom through (trustees) Bob Weiss and Joel Ferguson and the president (Peter McPherson) because most people wanted to open it up and see who would apply. And then some wanted a black coach,\" Heathcote said in 2014. \"But I felt Tom deserved the job because he'd been there 12 years, and he'd gotten better in the job every single year. Tom was a tireless worker and had a passion for the game. So that combination, in my mind, I knew he was going to be a good coach.\"\nIn 2001, the National Association of Basketball Coaches awarded him with the Golden Anniversary Award for 50 years of service to college basketball. Also, in 2001, he was inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2009, Heathcote was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\n1995–present: Tom Izzo era.\nTom Izzo took over for Heathcote in 1995 after 11 years as an assistant coach under Heathcote. \nMichigan State struggled in the first season with Izzo at the helm and after losing All-American Shawn Respert. The Spartans finished the season at .500 (16–16, 9–9) and in a tie for seventh place in the Big Ten. MSU received an invitation to the NIT where they defeated Washington before losing to Fresno State in the second round. The season marked the last time MSU did not finish with a winning record.\nIn 1997, the Spartans welcomed new recruits Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson to East Lansing. Along with sophomore Antonio Smith, the three made up three-fourths of Izzo's \"Flintstones\" who would win the national championship in 2000 (without Smith). In what would be a rarity for MSU in Izzo's tenure, the Spartans played no ranked teams in the non-conference season. The Spartans finished in a tie for sixth place in the conference with a record of 16–11 overall and 9–9 in conference. They received an invitation to the NIT for the second consecutive year. MSU beat George Washington in the first round and lost in the second round to Florida State. As of 2024, this is the last year MSU failed to make the NCAA tournament.\nIn 1998, MSU welcomed freshman recruit Charlie Bell, the fourth of Izzo's \"Flintstones\" and started slow. They lost to No. 7 Temple, and suffered surprising losses to UIC and Detroit in non-conference. However, MSU won nine of their first 10 conference games before losing to eventual conference co-champion Illinois. In January, MSU entered the AP and Coaches rankings for the first time since the end of the 1994–95 season. The Spartans finished in a tie for the conference championship, their first since 1990, with a record of 13–3 in conference play. Mateen Cleaves was named Big Ten Player of the Year. The Spartans earned the No. 1 seed in the inaugural Big Ten tournament, but lost their first game in the quarterfinals to Minnesota. Izzo's team received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 4 seed in the East Region, their first trip to the Tournament since 1995. MSU advanced to their first Sweet Sixteen since 1990 by beating Eastern Michigan and No. 8 Princeton. The Spartans were eliminated from the Tournament by No. 1 North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen.\nAs the 1998–99 season began, Izzo began his willingness to play anyone anywhere mantra as the Spartans played three top seven teams in their first seven games. However, MSU lost all three. MSU would recover and, after losing their first Big Ten game to No. 24 Wisconsin, the Spartans won the remaining 15 games in conference and won the Big Ten conference regular season by six games with a record of 15–1, their second consecutive Big Ten title. For the second consecutive year, Mateen Cleaves was named Big Ten Player of the Year. The Spartans won the Big Ten tournament and earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region and ranked No. 2 in the country, MSU defeated Mount St. Mary's, and Mississippi to advance to their second straight Sweet Sixteen. A win over Oklahoma and Kentucky led MSU to the Final Four for the first time since 1979. However, MSU fell short in their bid for an NCAA championship, losing to Duke in the Final Four.\nIn 1999–2000. Seniors Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson led the way for the Spartans as they began the season ranked No. 3 in the country. However, Cleaves sustained a stress fracture in his right foot prior to the season which forced him to miss the non-conference schedule and MSU fell to 9–4 and ranked No. 11 in the country. After Cleaves' return, MSU finished the Big Ten regular season with a 13–3 conference record and 23–7 overall while being ranked No. 2 in the country and earned a share of the Big Ten title, their third consecutive Big Ten championship. Peterson was named Big Ten Player of the Year, the third consecutive year a Spartan had received the award. The Spartans went on to win the third annual Big Ten tournament as the No. 2 seed, defeating No. 25 Illinois for the championship for the second consecutive year. The Spartans were awarded the No. 1 seed, their second consecutive No. 1 seed, in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament. From there, the Spartans cruised to their third consecutive Sweet Sixteen with wins over Valparaiso, and Utah. MSU continued their national championship push by reaching their second consecutive Final Four with wins over Syracuse and Iowa State. MSU won every game by double digits despite playing the best possible seed in each round. In their Final Four matchup, Michigan State faced off against fellow Big Ten foe, Wisconsin, beating them in a hard-fought game, 53–41. In the national championship game, the Spartans triumphed over the Florida Gators 89–76, despite losing Cleaves to an ankle injury 3:42 into the second half. The win marked MSU's second national championship in basketball and Izzo's first and only championship to date.\nLosing both Cleaves and Peterson to graduation following the season, MSU still began the 2000–01 season ranked No. 3 in the country. Led by sophomore Jason Richardson, freshmen Zach Randolph, and seniors Charlie Bell and Andre Hutson, the Spartans finished the non-conference schedule undefeated and ranked No.1 in the country. MSU again earned a share the Big Ten title, their fourth consecutive, with a 13–3 conference record. They suffered a surprise defeat by Penn State in the Big Ten tournament in their attempt to win the tournament for the third consecutive year. They received their third consecutive No. 1 seed, in the South Region of the NCAA tournament. Seeking a repeat National Championship, MSU easily dispatched Alabama State and Fresno State to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth consecutive year. A win over Gonzaga and Temple led to the school's third straight trip to the Final Four. However, they were unable to repeat as national champions, losing to Arizona in the National Semifinal. Following the season, Randolph and Richardson each left school early and declared for the NBA draft.\nAs a result of Randolph and Richardson's early departure, MSU struggled with Izzo's tough non-conference schedule in 2002. The Spartans lost four games, all to teams ranked in the top 25 and started the Big ten season with three straight losses. The loss to Wisconsin snapped MSU's 53-game home winning streak. Michigan State finished the conference schedule at 10–6 and in fourth place with an overall record of 19–10. MSU lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to No. 23 Indiana marking the first time since 1997 that Michigan State did not win either the Big Ten regular season or tournament title. The Spartans received an at-large bid as a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament and were eliminated in the first round by NC State.\nFollowing the disappointment of an early NCAA tournament exit, the first time Izzo's squads had not won at least one game in the NCAA tournament, the 2002–03 team played another tough non-conference schedule. This time the Spartans faced three ranked teams, only losing one. However, they suffered four losses and finished the non-conference schedule at 8–4 and ranked No. 25 in the country. MSU began the Big Ten regular season losing four of their first six games and fell out of the rankings. The Spartans finished in a tie for third place in the Big Ten at 10–6 in conference and 18–11 overall. Michigan State beat Purdue in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, but fell to Ohio State in the semifinals. The Spartans received a bid to the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year. MSU received a No. 7 seed in the South Region. A win over Colorado in the first round was followed by a rout of No. 10 Florida to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fifth time in six years. The Spartans defeated No. 17 Maryland to advance to the Elite Eight for the fourth time in five years. However, MSU fell to No. 5 Texas in the Regional Final.\nIn 2004, Izzo looked to continue his dominant NCAA run. However, Izzo's penchant for tough scheduling hurt his team as they faced a murderer's row of a schedule which included three straight losses to No. 6 Duke, in overtime, to No. 14 Oklahoma at the Palace of Auburn Hills, and to No. 8 Kentucky at Ford Field in the Basketbowl. The Spartans followed this losing streak by losing two of their final four non-conference games including at No. 17 Syracuse and dropped out of the rankings. They finished the non-conference slate at 5–6. After a loss to open Big Ten play to No. 21 Wisconsin, the Spartans recovered to win seven of their next eight and six of their last seven Big Ten games. They finished in a tie for second place in the Big Ten at 12–4 and 17–10 overall. A win over Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals was followed by a third loss of the season to No. 17 Wisconsin. The Spartans received a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, reaching the tournament for the seventh consecutive year. But, for the second time in three years, the Spartans were knocked out in the first round, this time by Nevada.\nIn 2005, the Spartans again looked to rebound from a disappointing early NCAA tournament exit. They started the season 3–2, but cruised through the Big Ten, only losing three games, including a loss to No. 1 Illinois and finished second in conference to Illinois. MSU finished the regular season with a 13–3 conference record and 22–5 overall while being ranked No. 13 in the country. The Spartans lost in the quarterfinals in the Big Ten tournament to Iowa. Michigan State received an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed in the Austin Regional of the NCAA tournament, their eighth straight appearance in the Tournament under Tom Izzo. Wins over Old Dominion and Vermont led the Spartans to the Sweet Sixteen for the sixth time in eight years. In the Sweet Sixteen, the Spartans beat No. 3-ranked and No. 1-seeded Duke, which MSU had not defeated since 1958. The win marked Izzo's first win over Duke's Mike Krzyzewski (as of 2017). A double overtime victory over Kentucky sent the Spartans to their fourth Final Four in seven seasons. MSU would again fall in the Final Four, this time to No. 2-ranked and No. 1-seeded North Carolina.\nThe 2005–06 Spartans opened the season with a loss to Hawaii before losing to No. 8 Gonzaga led by Adam Morrison in triple overtime in the Maui Classic. Despite this, MSU ended the non-conference schedule at 12–2 and ranked No. 7 in the country. Early Big Ten losses followed by late season losses in conference left the Spartans 8–8 in the Big Ten. In the Big Ten tournament, MSU defeated Purdue and No. 9 Illinois before being defeated by No. 20 Iowa in the semifinals. The Spartans received an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed in the NCAA tournament, their ninth consecutive trip to the Tournament. In the Tournament, they lost to eventual Final Four Cinderella, George Mason, in the first round. Following the season, Shannon Brown declared for the NBA draft, leaving the Spartans one year prior to graduation, just the fourth player under Izzo to declare early.\nThe 2006–07 Spartans began the season 13–2, but were not ranked in the polls. A roller coaster Big Ten season resulted in MSU finishing 8–8 with a win against No. 1 Wisconsin which likely assured the Spartans a trip to the NCAA tournament. MSU lost to Wisconsin after beating Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the 10th consecutive year and beat Marquette, coached by former Izzo assistant Tom Crean, in the first round of the Tournament. A loss to No. 3 North Carolina in the second round ended the season.\nIn 2008, MSU finished the non-conference schedule 12–1 and ranked No. 6 in the country with wins over No. 24 NC State, No. 20 BYU, and No. 4 Texas. A hot start to the Big Ten schedule, winning six of seven, was followed by four losses in their next seven which left them in fourth place in the Big Ten with a record of 12–6. As the No. 4 seed tn the Big Ten tournament, they beat Ohio State before losing to No. 8 Wisconsin. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament to mark their 11th consecutive trip to the Tournament under Tom Izzo. As a No. 5 seed, the Spartans beat Temple, and Pittsburgh to move on to the Sweet Sixteen for the seventh time in 11 years. A rout by a Derrick Rose-led Memphis ended the season.\nBy the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Izzo's teams, though having great success in the NCAA tournament, had not won the Big Ten regular season title since 2001. A solid non-conference start left them at 9–2 and were ranked No. 10 in the country. MSU routed the Big Ten, winning their first five conference games, their best start in conference since 1978. MSU finished the conference season well, winning the Big Ten championship by four games with a 15–3 record, 25–5 overall, and ranked No. 7 in the country. Following the conclusion of the regular season, Kalin Lucas was named Big Ten Player of the Year and Tom Izzo was voted Big Ten Coach of the Year. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans defeated Minnesota. However, Michigan State's hopes for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament likely vanished as they were defeated by Ohio State, 82–70. Michigan State received an at-large bid as the No. 2 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, their 12th straight appearance in the Tournament. With wins over Robert Morris and USC, the Spartans were able to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, the school's eighth trip to the Sweet Sixteen in the previous 12 years. MSU advanced to the Elite Eight with a win over No. 14-ranked and No. 3-seeded Kansas. In the Elite Eight, the Spartans defeated Louisville to advance to Final Four in nearby Detroit, only 90 miles from MSU's campus. The Spartans defeated UConn in the national semifinals to earn their third-ever trip to the national championship game. With Izzo 1–0 in championship games and the Spartans 2–0 all-time, North Carolina scored more points than any team had ever scored in the first half of an NCAA championship game, scoring 55 and blowing out the Spartans 89–72, marking the Spartans first ever loss in the national championship game.\nIn 2010, the Spartans finished the non-conference schedule at 10–3. The Spartans began the Big Ten season on fire, winning their first nine games and went on to earn a share of the Big Ten championship with a 14–4 and ranked 11th in the country. As the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they were defeated in overtime by No. 6 seed Minnesota in the quarterfinals. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their 13th straight appearance, earning a No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region. A win over New Mexico State and Maryland led MSU to the Sweet Sixteen for the ninth time in 13 years. However, Kalin Lucas suffered a serious knee injury and would miss the remainder of the Tournament. MSU did not seem to miss him and would go on to beat Northern Iowa and Tennessee to advance to their second consecutive Final Four and sixth in the prior 12 years. In the National semifinal, they were defeated by Butler by two points.\nThe 2010–11 Spartans. let by senior Kalin Lucas, finished the non-conference portion of their season 8–4 and ranked No. 20 in the country. However, the Spartans were inconsistent in conference play, suffering nine losses and finishing 9–9 in conference and in danger of missing the NCAA tournament. After beating Iowa and blowing out No. 9 Purdue in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans fell to Penn State in the semifinals. The blowout win over Purdue likely ensured the Spartans inclusion in the NCAA tournament. Michigan State received a No. 10 seed in the Southeast Region of the NCAA tournament, their 14th straight appearance, but the lowest seeding the Spartans had received in the NCAA tournament since 2002. MSU fell behind early to UCLA in the second round (formerly known as the first round) and made a furious rally, but fell short, losing by two points. The loss marked only the fourth time MSU failed to win a game in their 14 trips to the NCAA tournament under Tom Izzo.\nThe 2011–12 Spartans, led by senior Draymond Green, started the season 0–2. However, MSU won the next 15 games in a row to jump into the top ten in the polls. A loss in the regular season finale at home to No. 10 Ohio State meant the Spartans shared the Big Ten regular season championship with Ohio State and Michigan, all of which finished the Big Ten season with a 13–5 conference record. In that loss to Ohio State, key freshman reserve, Branden Dawson, tore his ACL, ending his season. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, The Spartans beat Iowa, No. 14 Wisconsin, and No. 7 Ohio State to win the tournament championship, their first tournament championship since 2000. Draymond Green earned Big Ten Player of the Year honors, the fifth time a player had done so under Tom Izzo. Izzo was also named Big Ten Coach of the Year. MSU received a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA tournament, where they beat LIU–Brooklyn in the first round behind Green's triple-double. The Spartans overcame Saint Louis in the second round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. This marked the 10th time in 15 seasons that the Spartans advanced to at least the Sweet Sixteen. The Spartans, missing Dawson and struggling offensively, became the first No. 1 seed to lose in the Tournament, falling to No. 17 and No. 4-seeded Louisville.\nMSU began the 2012–13 season 11–2 and ranked No. 18 in the country with wins over No. 7 Kansas and Texas and were led by junior Keith Appling and freshman Gary Harris. The Spartans remained ranked the entire year while finishing tied for second in the Big Ten with Ohio State, with a 13–5 conference record and ranked No. 10 in the country. As the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they beat Iowa in the quarterfinals, but fell to eventual tournament champion, Ohio State, in the semifinals. The Spartans received a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 16th straight appearance in the tournament. MSU defeated Valparaiso and Memphis to advance to their fifth Sweet Sixteen in six years and their 11th trip in 16 years. However, the Spartans were defeated by Duke, who was led by Seth Curry, in the Sweet Sixteen.\nMichigan State began the 2013–14 season looking to continue Tom Izzo's Final Four streak: every player who had played four years for Izzo had made at least one Final Four. After beating No. 1 Kentucky in the Champions Classic, the Spartans moved to the No. 1 spot in the country. The Spartans held the No. 1 spot for three weeks before losing to North Carolina in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. The Spartans cruised through the remaining non-conference schedule, finishing 11–1, to begin the Big Ten season ranked No. 5 in the country. The Spartans won their first seven conference games, but due to injuries to Keith Appling, Adriean Payne, and Brendan Dawson, MSU lost five of their last eight conference games to finish in a second-place tie with Wisconsin at 12–6. The Spartans, finally healthy and at full strength, beat Northwestern, No. 12 Wisconsin, and No. 8 Michigan to capture the Big Ten tournament championship. This marked Michigan State's fourth tournament championship. Michigan State earned a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament's East Region. With wins against Delaware and Harvard, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the third straight year and the 12th time in 17 years. They defeated No. 1-seeded Virginia in the Sweet Sixteen to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2010. There they fell to No. 7 seed and eventual National Champion, Connecticut. With the loss, the Tom Izzo's Final Four streak ended. Shortly after the season, Gary Harris declared for the NBA draft.\nIn 2015, MSU started the season well, but with a shocking loss to Texas Southern at home in overtime, finished the non-conference season at 9–4 MSU rallied late in the Big Ten season, winning six of their last eight conference games. MSU finished the season in a tie for third place in conference and got hot in the Big Ten tournament beating Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland, before losing to No. 6 Wisconsin for the tournament title. The Spartans received an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed in the East Region. The bid was MSU's 18th straight trip to the NCAA tournament. MSU beat Georgia in the second round and surprised No. 2-seeded and No. 6-ranked Virginia in the Third Round. With the win, the Spartans advanced to their fourth straight Sweet Sixteen and seventh Sweet Sixteen in eight years. Wins over Oklahoma and Louisville in overtime gave MSU a trip to their seventh Final Four under Tom Izzo. In the Final Four, the Spartans fell to the eventual National Champions for the second straight season, losing a rematch of their Champions Classic game to Duke in the National semifinal.\nWith senior Denzel Valentine leading the 2015–16 Spartans, MSU went undefeated in the non-conference with the school's best start in history and moved to No. 1 in the polls. However, Valentine suffered a knee injury in late December and would miss four games as MSU lost its first game of the season in Big Ten play and fell from the top spot in the polls. Upon Valentine's return, MSU continued to struggle, losing four of their first seven conference games and marking their worst conference start since 2003. The Spartans recovered well, losing only one more conference game and finished 13–5 in conference, good enough for second place in the Big Ten. MSU's 26 regular season wins tied the most for a Michigan State team in the regular season. Following the regular season, \"USA Today\" named Valentine National Player of the Year. The Big Ten also announced that Valentine was the Big Ten's Player of the Year. As the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament, MSU defeated Ohio State for a third time on the season before dispatching Maryland and Purdue to win the tournament championship. With the win, MSU set the record for most Big Ten tournament championships with five (Ohio State has also won five, but one has been vacated due to NCAA violations). MSU, ranked No. 2 in the country, learned that it would not receive a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, instead receiving a No. 2 seed in the Midwest bracket. This marked the 19th consecutive year the Spartans made the NCAA tournament. Despite receiving the No. 2 seed, MSU was considered by some the favorite to with the NCAA Championship. However, MSU was shocked by No. 15-seeded Middle Tennessee in the first round in what some argued was the biggest upset in NCAA tournament history at the time.\nThe 2016–17 Spartans were decimated by departures from the prior year as seniors Denzel Valentine, Bryn Forbes, and Matt Costello all graduated and moved to the NBA. Freshman Deyonta Davis also declared his eligibility for the NBA after the year and sophomores Javon Bess and Marvin Clark transferred out of the program. In all, five of the Spartans' top six scorers from the 2016 team did not return. In response, MSU welcomed their most-heralded recruiting class ever as four top-50 ranked players entered the program: Miles Bridges, Joshua Langford, Cassius Winston, and Nick Ward. A young team would look to graduate transfer Ben Carter and seniors Gavin Schilling and Eron Harris to fill the holes left by departing players. However, Carter and Schilling suffered season-ending knee injuries before the season began and Harris would suffer one late in the season. As a result, MSU struggled up front as Ward at 6' 8\" was the tallest on the team. Former walk-on Kenny Goins became the backup big man at 6' 6\". Following losses in their first two games to top-10 teams, MSU suffered two other losses to top-20 teams. Bridges missed seven games with a knee injury near the end of the non-conference slate and the Spartans, who started the season ranked as high as 10 in some polls, entered Big Ten play with an 8–5 record. Izzo would lament his early-season schedule which involved trips to Hawaii, New York, and the Bahamas when his young team wouldn't get needed practice time. Wins to start conference play over Minnesota (twice) and Northwestern, which would prove to be two of their better wins on the season, and Bridges's return had MSU at 4–1 in conference play. However, inconsistency haunted the Spartans as their failure to win road games left the Spartans at 8–5 in conference play with a visit to conference leaders, Purdue. MSU was handled easily by the Boilermakers and Harris suffered his knee injury which appeared to spell the end of MSU's 19-year NCAA tournament streak. However, Bridges, who averaged over 16 points and eight rebounds on the season, and Ward who averaged over 13 points and six rebounds, led the Spartans as they knocked off No. 16-ranked Wisconsin to likely seal a trip to the NCAA tournament. A 10–8 conference record left the Spartans in a tie for fifth place. A win over Penn State in the Big Ten tournament preceded a loss to Minnesota, but was enough for the Spartans to get an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the 20th consecutive year. As a No. 9 seed, a win over Miami in the first round led to a loss to No. 1-seeded Kansas and an end to the season. Bridges finished the season with perhaps the second-best freshman season in MSU history (behind Magic Johnson): 16.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game.\nSurprisingly, Bridges opted to not enter the NBA draft and returned to Michigan State for his sophomore year in 2017–18. With newcomer Jaren Jackson Jr., a consensus top-25 player, joining the team, the Spartans were picked by several publications as the No. 1 team in the country. They began the season ranked No. 2 behind Duke. After a loss to Duke in the second game of the season, the Spartans won the Victory Bracket of the PK–80 Tournament holding No. 9-ranked North Carolina to a school-record low for shooting percentage as they shot 24.6% from the field, including 5.6% from three-point land. The Spartans won 14 straight games, and ascended to No. 1 in the country. A road loss to surprise Big Ten contender Ohio State followed by a home loss to rival Michigan dropped MSU in the rankings and shook the team's confidence. However, the team rebounded well, finishing the season by winning their last 12 regular season games, including a win over Big Ten co-leader Purdue as Bridges took the ball and hit a three-pointer to win the game. On February 17, 2018 while playing at Northwestern, the Spartans overcame a 27-point deficit to beat the Wildcats, at that time, the fifth largest comeback all-time in Division I history. The Spartans finished with a school-record 16 Big Ten wins and their first outright regular season Big Ten title since 2009. The team also finished 28–3, a record for regular season wins. The Spartans fell again to their rival Michigan in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament and received only a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament due to their low strength of schedule. The NCAA trip marked the school's 21st consecutive trip to the Tournament, but following a win in the first round over Bucknell, the Spartans fell to 11th-seeded Syracuse marking the third consecutive year and first time under Izzo that the Spartans had failed to reach the Sweet Sixteen in a three-year period. The Spartans led the nation in field goal defense, rebounding margin, and blocks. Freshman Jaren Jackson Jr. set the single-season MSU record for blocks and was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year. Bridges was named first-team All-Big Ten and second team All-American. For much of the season, the on-court play was shrouded by reports that surfaced that Tom Izzo's program had covered up sexual assault allegations ten years prior. Izzo refused to comment on the reports due to an ongoing investigation by several agencies including Michigan Attorney General's office and the United States Department of Education, but repeatedly said he had no intention of leaving Michigan State and that he had cooperated with all investigations including the previous allegation of sexual assault in 2010. In August 2018 the NCAA cleared Izzo in his handling of the sexual assault allegations. The school was implicated tangentially to the FBI-college basketball scandal as reports surfaced that Bridges had been paid to attend Michigan State, among other allegations. MSU conducted an investigation and presented their findings that the allegations were false to the NCAA, who cleared Bridges, ruling him eligible to play.\nFollowing Bridges and Jackson's departures to the NBA, the 2018–19 team began the season ranked No. 10 in the country. The season was dominated by injuries to the Spartans. Starting guard Joshua Langford only played 13 games before missing the rest of the season with a foot injury. Key starter Matt McQuaid missed three games with injury and key reserve Kyle Ahrens missed nine games with back and ankle injuries. With five games remaining in the Big Ten regular season, big man Nick Ward suffered a hairline fracture in his shooting hand and missed the rest of the regular season. He returned in time for the postseason, but was not the same as he struggled to return to the lineup. Despite this, the Spartans earned a share of the Big Ten regular season championship with Purdue and defeated arch-rival Michigan twice in the regular season. Led by Big Ten Player of the Year and consensus second team All-American Cassius Winston, the Spartans also won the Big Ten tournament for the sixth time, again defeating Michigan in the championship game to go 3–0 against their rival. As the No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, the school's 22nd straight appearance in the Tournament, the Spartans defeated Bradley and Minnesota to advance to their first Sweet Sixteen in four years. In the Sweet Sixteen, the Spartans blew out No. 3 seed LSU to face top-seeded Duke in the Elite Eight. Despite having multiple first round NBA Draft picks, the Spartans knocked off the Blue Devils to earn a trip to the school's 10th Final Four and eighth under Izzo. The win over Duke improved Izzo's record to 2–11 against Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. In the Final Four, the Spartans were upset by Texas Tech, ending the school's bid for a third national championship. Winston led the Spartans, averaging 18.8 points and 7.5 assists per game.\nThe 2020 team started the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll for the first time in school history. Senior point guard Cassius Winston was a popular pick as the preseason player of the year. However, shortly before the season, it was announced that Josh Langford had reinjured the foot that had caused him to miss most of the prior season. Langford would not play a game for the Spartans during the season. Due in part to Langford's injury, the Spartans struggled in the non-conference schedule, losing the first game of the season to No. 2 Kentucky before losing twice more in their first eight games and falling to 5–3. MSU also struggled as Cassius Winston dealt with the suicide of his brother, Zachary, on November 10, 2020. Winston did not miss a game due to the tragedy, but did struggle for a portion of the season. MSU rebounded as Winston struggled to return to his All-American form and the Spartans did not lose again until Big Ten play after starting the conference schedule 5–0. The Spartans then lost six of their next 10 games to all but assure they would be unable to win their third straight Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans rebounded to win their final five games and come from a three-game deficit to earn a share of their third straight Big Ten championship. As the Spartans prepared for the postseason, they were once again a popular pick to win the NCAA tournament. However, the season ended abruptly when all postseason tournaments, including the NCAA tournament, were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cassius Winston finished his MSU career with the most assists in Big Ten history and was a consensus second team All-American for the second consecutive year.\nIn the COVID-19-shortened 2020–21 season, MSU began the season well, beating Duke at the Champions Classic for only the third time under Izzo. MSU finished the shortened non-conference schedule with a perfect 6–0 record and ranked No. 4 in the country. However, things changed abruptly when MSU began Big Ten play. The Spartans lost four of their first six games before pausing team activities for about two weeks due to positive COVID-19 tests in the program. Upon returning to play, MSU lost three straight dropping their conference record to 2–7 on the season and making it seem highly unlikely that they would continue the school's NCAA tournament appearance streak. Four games later, their odds had not improved as they sat at 4–9 in conference and 10–9 overall with seven games remaining. MSU, however, did the unthinkable: five of their last seven games including wins over No. 5 Illinois, No. 4 Ohio State, and No. 2 Michigan to finish the regular season with 15–11 overall record. At 9–11 in the Big Ten, MSU finished with a losing record for the first time under Izzo, but looked safe to move the NCAA tournament streak to 23 straight appearances. A loss in the second round of the Big Ten tournament marked the first time ever that the Spartans would not compete in the quarterfinals and left them on shaky ground for the NCAA tournament. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 11 seed in the South region. For the first time, MSU was forced to participate in the First Four, losing to UCLA in overtime.\nLooking to rebound from one of the worst seasons in Izzo's tenure, the Spartans began the 2021–22 season with a loss to No. 3 Kansas. Following the loss, they won five straight before losing to defending national champion Baylor. They would not lose again until suffering a home loss to Northwestern ended their perfect start to conference play leaving them at 14–, 5–1 on the season. They rebounded well in the next game, winning on the road against No. 8 Wisconsin, but would lose six of their next nine games to drop to 9–7 in Big Ten play and falling out of the national polls. A win over No. 4 Purdue restored likely ensured a trip to the NCAA tournament, but the Spartans dropped two of their last three regular season games, finishing 11–9 in Big Ten play and finishing in a tie with Michigan for seventh in the conference. They beat Maryland in the second round of the Big Ten tournament before beating Wisconsin in the quarterfinals. However, their Big Ten tournament run ended in the semifinals with a loss to Purdue. The Spartans continued their streak of NCAA tournament appearances, extending it to 24 straight seasons as they received an at-large bid as the No. 7 seed in the West region. In the first round, they eked out a 74–73 win against Davidson, featuring former MSU player Foster Loyer. In the second round of the tournament, they faced Duke in what would be the final match-up between Mike Krzyzewski and Tom Izzo due to Krzyzewski's retirement after the season. MSU kept the game close and held a 70–65 with five minutes remaining before Duke outscored them 20–6 to end the game and eliminate the Spartans from the tournament.\nCoaches.\nThree Michigan State coaches have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. They are Pete Newell (National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2006), Jud Heathcote (National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2009), and Tom Izzo (Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2016). Since 1976, the Spartans have had only two head basketball coaches, Heathcote and Izzo. Heathcote (1976–1995) coached the Spartans for 19 seasons before retiring following the 1994–95 season. His hand-picked successor, Izzo, an assistant with MSU since 1983, completed his 25th year as head coach of the Spartans in 2020.\nOn November 28, 2009, Izzo passed Heathcote's mark of 340 career wins by beating UMass 106–68. Izzo now leads all MSU basketball coaches in wins with 628 through 2020. On March 6, 2022, Izzo surpassed Bob Knight for the most wins by a men's basketball coach at a Big Ten school with 663.\nOf all MSU coaches who have headed the Spartans basketball squad in at least a dozen games, Izzo is second in winning percentage and no MSU coach tops him since 1910. Former coach George E. Denman won all 11 games he coached between 1901 and 1903 and Chester L. Brewer won 70 of 95 games from 1903 to 1910. \nJud Heathcote.\nJud Heathcote won three Big Ten titles in his 19 years at MSU. His teams appeared in nine NCAA tournaments, four Sweet Sixteens, one Elite Eight, one Final Four and won one National Championship. After his early success with Magic Johnson and company, Heathcote finished his career strong, appearing in five NCAA tournaments in his final six years. However, he never advanced past the Sweet Sixteen after winning the championship in 1979. His teams also appeared in three NITs reaching the NIT Final Four in 1989.\nHeathcote was named Big Ten Coach of the Year in 1978 and 1986. Heathcote was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2009.\nTom Izzo worked as an assistant under Heathcote for 12 years prior to being named his successor. Other assistants who worked under Heathcote went on to head coaching positions: Don Monson (Idaho and Oregon), Bill Berry (San Jose State), Mike Deane (Siena, Marquette, Lamar, and Wagner), Jim Boylan (Chicago Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks), Jim Boylen (Utah), Stan Joplin (Toledo), and Brian Gregory (Dayton, Georgia Tech, and South Florida).\nRecord by season under Heathcote:\n\"See Michigan State Spartans men's basketball seasons\"\nTom Izzo.\nSince 1995, the team has been coached by Tom Izzo, who has an overall record of 700–288 (Through January 31, 2024) as the head coach at Michigan State. Izzo coached the Spartans to their second national championship in 2000 with an 89–76 victory over Florida. Izzo has turned Michigan State into a perennial basketball powerhouse.\nIzzo is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nIzzo has guided the Spartans to eight NCAA Final Fours since 1999, an accomplishment unmatched by any other college basketball program during that span. Izzo has never had a losing season at MSU and has also appeared in a postseason tournament every year he has headed the MSU basketball program: two years in the NIT and 26 straight appearances in the NCAA tournament. His teams have won ten Big Ten regular-season championships, six Big Ten tournament championships and have reached the Sweet Sixteen 20 times, the Elite Eight 14 times, the Final Four eight times, and played in two NCAA Championship games, in which they won the 2000 NCAA National Championship Tournament.\nIzzo has received numerous awards including the 1998 Associated Press National Coach of the Year, the 1998 Basketball News National Coach of the Year, the 1998 United States Basketball Writers Association Henry Iba Coach of the Year Award (1998), three-time Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year (1998, 2009, 2012), the 1998 Basketball Times Mideast Coach of the Year, the 1999 Basketball News Coach of the Year Award, two-time National Association of Basketball Coaches Coach of the Year Award (2001, 2012) and the 2005 Clair Bee Award.\nIzzo also helped his assistants secure head coaching jobs across the basketball world. Tom Crean, the former head coach at Georgia, was head coach at Indiana and Marquette for nine years each. Brian Gregory coached for Dayton and Georgia Tech and is the current head coach at South Florida. Mark Montgomery was the head coach at Northern Illinois from 2011 to 2021. Current Izzo assistant coach Mike Garland spent three seasons as head coach at Cleveland State following an initial seven-year stint as an assistant at MSU. Former assistant Stan Heath was head coach at Kent State, Arkansas, and South Florida. Doug Wojcik was the head coach at Tulsa and College of Charleston.\nOn March 15, 2019, Izzo won his 600th game. On January 30, 2024, also his 69th birthday, Izzo won his 700th game by beating rival Michigan 81–62.\nBranding.\nOn March 11, 2021, Michigan State announced that the men's basketball team would be known as \"MSU Spartans Presented by Rocket Mortgage.\" The next day, Michigan State issued a clarification stating that it was not renaming its basketball team. The announcement and clarification were discussed on national sports programs and commentaries were published on news and sports sites.\nSeason by season results.\nUnder Tom Izzo:\nPostseason history.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Spartans have appeared in 37 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments, with a current streak of 26 straight years, with two NCAA basketball national championships. They have appeared in ten Final Fours and sport a 73–36 all-time NCAA tournament record.\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Spartans have appeared in the NCAA tournament 37 times. Their combined record is 73–36.\nNCAA tournament history and seeds.\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The Spartans have received a No. 1 seed in five Tournaments. Their average seed in the NCAA tournament is a 4.8. They have been a No. 5 seed the most times (six). The lowest seed the Spartans have received in the Tournament is 11.\nPrior to seeding in NCAA tournaments, MSU appeared in the 1957, 1959, and 1978 NCAA tournaments. Since 1979, the Spartans have failed to qualify for the tournament 11 times. They have a current streak of 26 straight appearances in the tournament (as of 2024).\n\"*\"\nThe Spartans have appeared in 37 NCAA tournaments, reaching the Sweet Sixteen 21 times, the Elite Eight 14 times, the Final Four 10 times, and the national championship game three times. They have reached the Final Four three times as a No. 1 seed, three times as a No. 2 seed, twice as a No. 5 seed, and once as a No. 7 seed. They won the National Championship as a No. 2 seed in 1979 and as a No. 1 seed in 2000.\nNIT results.\nThe Spartans have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 6–6.\nBig Ten regular-season championships.\nMichigan State has won 16 Big Ten regular-season championships, the sixth-most in Big Ten history.\nBig Ten tournament championships.\nMichigan State has won six Big Ten tournament championships since its inception in 1998, the most championships in the Big Ten. The Spartans have appeared in seven championship games, only losing the 2015 championship to Wisconsin. Michigan State had appeared in the quarterfinals of every Big Ten tournament until 2021.\nRecord vs. Big Ten opponents.\nMichigan State only has losing records against four Big Ten teams.\nSpartans of Note.\nSpartans in the NBA.\nSpartans formerly in the NBA include:\nSpartans currently in the NBA, G-League, unsigned, or are active in other professional leagues include:\nUniforms.\nTom Izzo's teams have worn many different styles of uniform during his 27 years at Michigan State. Nike, Inc. started making jerseys for the team at the start of the 2000–01 season.\nThe current home jersey, introduced as part of a rebranding effort by the athletic department in April 2010, is white with green uniform numbers and a green custom font \"SPARTANS\" across the chest. The road jersey is green with white uniform numbers and a white custom font \"SPARTANS\" across the chest. The Spartans do not currently wear an official alternate uniform but the team has worn a silver alternate, a 1979 throwback, a 2000 throwback, and a MAC (Michigan Agricultural College) uniform in the past. The team also wore specially-made camouflage jerseys for the 2011 Carrier Classic, played on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier against North Carolina. Beginning in the 2014–15 season, the Spartans frequently wore their 1979 throwback jerseys as their home uniform. On January 23, 2016, MSU wore specially designed \"Mean Green\" uniforms. During the 2016–17 season, the Spartans frequently wore the MAC throwback uniforms at home.\nFacilities.\nThe Spartans used the College Gymnasium prior to moving to Demonstration Hall for 10 years.\nDemonstration Hall.\nThe Spartans used this building, still in use on campus today, as their home from 1930 to the opening of Jenison Fieldhouse in 1940.\nJenison Fieldhouse.\nThe arena opened in 1940 and was named for alumnus Frederick Cowles Jenison, whose estate, along with PWAP funds, funded the building. The building was the home of the Spartans from 1940 to 1989 when the Breslin Center opened.\nThe venue is most famous for its 1979 NCAA champion basketball team, which included Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, and was coached by Jud Heathcote.\nJenison also hosted the 1963 NCAA tournament's Mideast Regionals. A plaque outside the arena commemorates one of the 1963 regional semifinals; the \"Game of Change,\" in which a segregated Mississippi State team played and lost to the eventual national champion, an integrated Loyola team. The losing Maroons (now known as the Bulldogs) had defied a court order prohibiting them from leaving the state to play an integrated team. The game is now seen as a watershed moment in the intersection of civil rights and sports during the Civil Rights Movement.\nThe building is still in use on campus today.\nBreslin Center.\nThe Spartans play home games at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center on campus. The arena is commonly referred to as \"Breslin\" and \"the Bres\", and was opened in 1989. It is named for Jacweir \"Jack\" Breslin, an MSU alumnus, former athlete and administrator, who first began pushing for the arena in 1969. Its capacity is 14,797 seats, and the stadium superseded Jenison Fieldhouse. \nThe arena's current basketball court is the same floor where the Spartans won the 2000 NCAA tournament, which was at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. The school purchased the floor from the NCAA and Final Four floor installer Horner Flooring after the title game. A plaque was installed on the baseline near the Michigan State tunnel to commemorate the floor's role in the school's history.\nThe Breslin Center is home to the Izzone, a large student section named after Coach Izzo, the basketball team's head coach since 1995. The student section had been named Spartan Spirits and Jud's Jungle prior to Izzo's prominence at the school. The Izzone routinely gets mentioned in discussions of the nation's top student fan sections, and in 2006 was ranked as the 4th-best in the country. The section helped cheer the Spartans to a 53-game home win streak between 1998 and 2002 and also a 28-game winning streak from 2007 and 2009.\nThe arena underwent a $50 million renovation to improve the visitor experience and to create a Michigan State University Basketball Hall of History."

        "title": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament upsets",
        "text": "An upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, a single-elimination tournament, this generally constitutes a lower seeded team defeating a higher-seeded (\"i.e.\", higher-ranked) team; a widely recognized upset is one performed by a team ranked substantially lower than its opponent.\nThis is the list of victories by teams seeded 11 or lower in the first round and second rounds of the tournament, as well as those by teams seeded 8 or 9 against 1 and 7 or 10 against 2 seeds in the second round, since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985; as these low-seeded teams were automatically paired against higher-seeded teams at the start of the tournament, their opening victories are almost always considered upsets (to date only three teams seeded 11 or lower in the first round won as betting favorites, and only one such team won in the first round as a pick 'em). Most victories by these teams in later rounds were usually against better seeded opponents as well. The list also includes victories by teams seeded 8 or lower in the Sweet 16 (the four regional semifinals), teams seeded 7 or lower in the Elite Eight (the four regional finals), and teams seeded 6 or lower in the Final Four. All teams are listed by athletic brand names they used at the time of their wins, which do not always match those in use today.\nThe NCAA defines a tournament \"upset\" as a victory by a team seeded 5 or more lines below its defeated opponent.\nOn March 16, 2018, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Retrievers became the first 16-seed to upset a 1-seed when they defeated the Virginia Cavaliers 74–54 in the first round; this was followed by the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights defeating the Purdue Boilermakers 63–58 on March 17, 2023.\nMost successful low seeds.\nBest outcomes for low seeds since expansion to 64 teams in 1985:\nBest performances by No. 16 seeds.\nIn 2018, UMBC became the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in the men's tournament, shocking Virginia 74–54. Before this breakthrough, five other 16 seeds lost by 4 or fewer points:\nIn 2023, Fairleigh Dickinson became the second No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in the tournament, beating Purdue 63–58.\nPoint spread upsets.\nDespite numerous instances of early-round tournament upsets, only two No. 1 seeds have lost in the first round to a No. 16 seed. However, while seeding is one way of measuring the impact of an upset, prior to the implementation of seeding, point spread was the better determinant of an upset, and a loss by a highly favored team remains for many the definition of \"upset\". As the NCAA forbids any association with gambling, and point spreads vary depending on the bookie taking the bets, these are unofficial:\nRound of 64.\nThis round was called the first round until 2011, when the introduction of the First Four caused the round to be renamed the second round. Starting with the 2016 tournament, it returned to being called the first round. There were eight official first round upsets in 2016, which was the most in tournament history.\nDetail between each pair of seeds in this section has been updated as of completion of the 2024 Round of 64, representing 156 games played between each pair.\n16 defeats 1.\nThere have been 2 games where a 16-seed has defeated a 1-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1985:\n15 defeats 2.\nThere have been 11 games where a 15-seed has defeated a 2-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1985:\n14 defeats 3.\nThere have been 23 games where a 14-seed has defeated a 3-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1985:\n13 defeats 4.\nThere have been 33 games where a 13-seed has defeated a 4-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1985:\n12 defeats 5.\nThere have been 55 games where a 12-seed has defeated a 5-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1985:\n11 defeats 6.\nThere have been 61 games where an 11-seed has defeated a 6-seed (), in the round of 64, since 1985:\nRound of 32.\nThis round is called the second round. Occasionally, it is referred to as the regional quarterfinals.\nThis shows all Round of 32 upset victories by teams seeded 11 or lower, continuing their upset victories from the round of 64. This section introduces additional \"meeting criteria of team seeded 5 or more lines below its defeated opponent\", being all Round of 32 upset victories by teams seeded 8 or 9 against 1 seeds and by teams seeded 7 or 10 against 2 seeds.\n16th seed victories.\nNo 16 seed has won a second-round game. The only 16 seeds to ever reach the second round are the UMBC Retrievers in 2018, who lost to 9 seed Kansas State 50–43, and the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights in 2023, who lost to 9 seed Florida Atlantic 78–70.\n15th seed victories.\nFour of the eleven 15 seeds () who advanced from the round of 64 also achieved an upset victory in the round of 32. Seeds of the teams they defeated are in parentheses. Due to these results, 15 seeds have a winning record (4-2) against 7 seeds, but have never beaten a 10 seed (0-5).\n14th seed victories.\nTwo of the twenty-three 14 seeds () who advanced from the round of 64 also achieved an upset victory in the round of 32.

Twenty-seven of the ninety 7 seeds who faced 2 seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen (). This means that 7 seeds have a lower winning percentage in the round of 32 than 10 seeds do.\nSweet Sixteen.\nThe Sweet Sixteen are the eight pairs of teams that meet in the Regional semifinals.\n15 seeds.\nOne of the four 15 seeds () who advanced from the round of 32 also achieved an upset victory in the Sweet Sixteen, that being Saint Peter’s in 2022.

        "title": "2007 Monaco Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2007 Monaco Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2007) was a Formula One motor race held on 27 May 2007 at the Circuit de Monaco. It was the fifth race of the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship.\nThe 78-lap race was won from pole position by Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, driving a McLaren-Mercedes. Alonso took his second consecutive Monaco win by four seconds from English teammate Lewis Hamilton, with Brazilian Felipe Massa third in a Ferrari.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThe Grand Prix was contested by 22 drivers, in eleven teams of two. The teams, also known as \"constructors\", were Renault, McLaren-Mercedes, Ferrari, Honda, Spyker-Ferrari, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Red Bull-Renault, Williams-Toyota, Toro Rosso-Ferrari and Super Aguri.\nBefore the race, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship, with 30 points, ahead of team-mate Fernando Alonso on 28 and Ferrari driver Felipe Massa on 27 points. Massa's team-mate Kimi Räikkönen was fourth, ahead of BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld in fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren were leading with 58 points, nine points ahead of Ferrari with 49 points; BMW Sauber were a further 26 points in third.\nTesting started a week and a half before the race at Circuit Paul Ricard using the circuit's 2D SC configuration to replicate the Circuit de Monaco. Lewis Hamilton went on to score the fastest times on the days of testing whilst the circuit was in the Monaco configuration.\nHamilton, who had never lost a race on the Monte Carlo track (having won there in both GP2 and F3) played down his chances of winning the race, although he still remained \"realistic\" and optimistic, looking to fight for a win as is \"the case with everything (he) competes in.\"\nSix days before the race, Ferrari employee Nigel Stepney tried to sabotage Kimi Räikkönen's and Felipe Massa's cars, when a mysterious powder was found in the fuel tank of Räikkönen's and Massa's car. The parts were replaced before the race and the powder was sent to the police to be examined. Stepney was reportedly angry with Ferrari for not being promoted to technical director after Ross Brawn, left the team after last season.\nFerrari changed the colour of their car dark red which was changed to approximate the color scheme used by Marlboro.\nPractice.\nThe final practice session on Saturday morning was heavily affected by rain. Adrian Sutil of Spyker topped the timesheets for this session due to the conditions.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was dominated throughout by the two McLarens of Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. Despite Hamilton setting fastest times for the first session, Alonso outpaced him in the final stages to take pole position, with Hamilton being held up slightly by Mark Webber. Felipe Massa of Ferrari qualified third fastest, posting a time after the clock stopped. Kimi Räikkönen made a mistake and hit the barriers coming out of the Swimming Pool Complex during the second qualifying stage, breaking his front-right suspension. The damage inflicted could not be repaired and he qualified sixteenth. Despite provisionally making the top ten, David Coulthard was penalised for impeding Heikki Kovalainen and demoted to thirteenth. Coulthard's demotion allowed Jenson Button to participate in the final qualifying stage, but he failed to move up the field and finished the qualifying session in 10th place.\nOf those whose qualifying went well, former Monaco resident Giancarlo Fisichella fared best, putting his Renault on the second row in fourth place. Nico Rosberg's performance marked a return to form for his Williams team; his fifth place was the British constructor's best qualifying position since Mark Webber's second place at the same track one year before in 2006. Webber himself also fared well, filling the second slot on row three, alongside Rosberg, in sixth place.\nRace.\nThe race started at 14:00 CET. From the starting line everyone got away for the first laps, with Hamilton diving in behind Alonso to defend any of the Ferrari's advances. After the race, FIA launched an investigation of the McLaren team for giving out team orders, to the effect of asking Hamilton not to attempt to race or overtake Alonso. McLaren were later cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA.\nNo other car in the field could keep up with the sheer pace of both of the McLaren-Mercedes, with Massa, after a competitive first stint in third place, dropping to sixty seconds behind Hamilton. Notably, he was the only car the two McLaren drivers did not lap during the afternoon.\nKimi Räikkönen came back up the field to eighth place to gain one championship point after his poor qualifying performance.\nVitantonio Liuzzi crashed out of the race on the second lap, a fate that befell Spyker driver Adrian Sutil in the second half of the Grand Prix. The other Spyker car, driven by Christijan Albers failed to finish the race due to a mechanical problem. The only other retirement was Mark Webber, whose Red Bull's gearbox failed in the early stages of the race."

        "title": "Paul Nicholls (horse racing)",
        "text": "Paul Frank Nicholls (born 17 April 1962) is a British National Hunt horse trainer with stables at Ditcheat, Somerset. A relatively successful jump jockey, Nicholls has become the leading National Hunt trainer of his generation in Britain, finishing the 2007–08 season with 155 winners and a record £4 million in prize money. As of April 2023, he has trained over 3,500 winners, won the 2012 Grand National, four Cheltenham Gold Cups and has been crowned British jump racing Champion Trainer fourteen times.\nEarly life and education.\nThe son of a policeman, Nicholls was educated at Marlwood School, Alveston before leaving at 16 to take up work in a local point-to-point yard.\nJockey career.\nNicholls turned conditional in 1982 under the tutelage of Josh Gifford before joining David Barons in 1985, and became stable jockey in 1986. It was with Barons that Nicholls was most closely associated during his riding career. The pair enjoyed numerous big race successes, including back-to-back wins in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury with Broadheath in 1986 and Playschool the following year. Playschool also won the 1987 Welsh Grand National, and the 1988 Irish Hennessy Gold Cup with Nicholls. Playschool was subsequently made favourite for the 1988 Cheltenham Gold Cup but was pulled up before the 20th fence. Barons attributed Playschool's lacklustre performance to doping but his claims were never substantiated. Following a broken leg when kicked by a horse during pre-season training sustained in 1989, Nicholls retired from the saddle having ridden a respectable 133 winners during a seven-year career.\nTraining career.\nNicholls took out his trainer's licence in 1991, having served a two-year apprenticeship as assistant trainer to Barons which saw him assist in Seagram's winning Grand National attempt. In response to an advert placed in the Sporting Life, Nicholls began his training operation at Manor Farm, Ditcheat, in stables rented from local dairy farmer Paul Barber. Starting with just eight horses, his first winner soon followed, the appropriately named Olveston, owned by Nicholls' father and named after the South Gloucestershire village in which he was raised. A steady climb up the training ladder followed, with Nicholls' first grade one success coming with See More Indians in the Feltham Novices' Chase at Kempton in 1993. \nHowever, it was the 1999 Cheltenham Festival that saw Nicholls' breakthrough into jump racing's elite, winning three of the most prestigious steeplechases in National Hunt racing. Nicholls enjoyed a memorable meeting, collecting the Queen Mother Champion Chase with Call Equiname, the Arkle Challenge Trophy with Flagship Uberalles, and the Gold Cup with See More Business. However, it was not until the end of the 2005–06 season, after seven years of filling the runners up spot that Nicholls was finally crowned Champion Trainer for the first time, his eventual coronation coming after a long struggle for supremacy with multiple champion Martin Pipe.\nThe appointment of the Irish rider Ruby Walsh as stable jockey strengthened Nicholls' hand in the big races. Their major successes include the Queen Mother Champion Chase with Azertyuiop (2004) and Master Minded (2008 and 2009), five wins in the King George VI Chase with Kauto Star (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011) and the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Kauto Star in 2007 and 2009. Nicholls' finest hour came in the 2008 Cheltenham Gold Cup where he saddled the first three horses home: in finishing order, Denman (ridden by Sam Thomas), Kauto Star and Neptune Collonges. At the high of his stable stars' powers, Nicholls' dominance extended across the Irish Sea and his horses plundered Ireland's most valuable jumping prizes with increasing regularity. \nIn December 2008, Nicholls trained his 50th grade one winner when Master Minded (ridden by AP McCoy) won the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown, and on 5 November 2011, Kauto Stone made Nicholls the fastest National Hunt trainer to reach 2000 winners.\nMany equine stars have been nurtured by Nicholls and there are few top prizes to elude him, the two missing races from his UK portfolio were added in 2012 when Rock on Ruby won the Champion Hurdle and Neptune Collonges, ridden by Daryl Jacob, won the Grand National.\nIn April 2016, he won the champion trainer's title for the tenth time.\nNicholls was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to the horse racing industry.\nPersonal life.\nNicholls is renowned for being approachable and media-friendly. He writes a popular column on Betfair and his frank and honest opinions are well respected by members of the racing public. \nAway from racing, Nicholls has a keen interest in horticulture, particularly rose growing. He is also an avid supporter of Manchester United, whose long-time manager Sir Alex Ferguson has several horses in training with Nicholls.\nIn November 2009, Nicholls starred alongside Kauto Star in a short film to promote Somerset, commissioned by inward investment agency Into Somerset.\nHe has been married three times. He married Georgie Brown in Barbados in May 2011. The couple have two children, while Nicholls also has a daughter from his second marriage and a son by a fourth relationship.\nMajor wins.\n Great Britain\n Ireland\n France"

He played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga from 1998 to 2009.\nCareer.\nMüller made his professional debut with EHC Klostersee of the 2nd Bundesliga in the 1997-98 season, before playing in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) from 1998 to 2009. He won the league championship with the Krefeld Pinguine in 2002–03, repeating the feat with the Adler Mannheim in 2006–07.\nThe Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Müller as their ninth-round pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, 275th overall, but he never played for the team.\nIllness and death.\nIn November 2006, Müller was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, known as glioblastoma. Part of the tumor was surgically removed, followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment later in the year. It appeared impossible for Müller to play professional ice hockey any longer, but he recovered and made his comeback on 3 February 2007 at the DEL All-Star Game 2007.\nIn 2008, Müller was named again to the national team at the Skoda Cup in Switzerland. In August of that same year, while playing for the Kölner Haie, the tumor continued to grow, requiring another operation. After that he absolved his physician, Wolfgang Wick, from patient/physician confidentiality. Wick told the media that Müller was terminally ill and already exceeded the anticipated average life, as only 3% of the people having the same cancer live over five years.\nOn 18 December 2008 Müller's doctor declared him no longer fit to play, as his condition grew worse. He died of brain cancer on 21 May 2009; he is survived by his two children.\nAfter Müller's death it was announced that the Kölner Haie, Adler Mannheim, and EHC Klostersee would all retire his number 80. EHC Red Bull München also retired his number 80, even though Müller had never played for München. The DEL also announced that starting with the 2009/10 season, the number 80 would never be used in the league again.\nIn 2017 Müller's silhouette was used for the logo of the 2017 IIHF World Championship."

He is one of two John Bevans who played for Wales during the 1970s.\nRugby career.\nHis début for Wales came on 16 January 1971 during the Five Nations Championship when Wales played England. He crowned the win with a try as Wales ran out 22-6 winners. He played in all of the other games in the tournament, but did not score again, as Wales went on to win the championship and the Grand Slam.\nStarting his career in rugby union, he played for the Cardiff club and after being capped for Wales in 1971, Bevan toured Australia and New Zealand with the British Lions. He played in 14 matches including the first test and scored a total of 18 tries. The 17 scored in New Zealand equalled the record of Tony O'Reilly. He was a speedy wing (number 11) from Tylorstown South Wales and was also immensely strong. His powerful bullocking running style was all the more appropriate as he shared the initials JCB with a renowned British manufacturer of bulldozers. He is chiefly remembered for his role in the Barbarians' victory over New Zealand in 1973, during which he scored a try.\nDuring his short international career Bevan scored 5 tries for Wales.\nIn September 1973, Bevan switched to rugby league, and joined Warrington for the then massive signing on fee of £12,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £200,000 in 2015).

        "text": "Daniel John McLellan (August 6, 1928 – October 27, 1979) was a Canadian professional hockey player and coach in the National Hockey League. He was a member of teams that won the Memorial Cup, the Allan Cup and the world championships.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in South Porcupine, Ontario (now part of Timmins), McLellan was signed by the Toronto Maple Leafs and brought to Toronto to play for the St. Michael's Buzzers (1945–46) and then the St. Michael's Majors, playing on the team that won the Memorial Cup in 1947. As a senior, McLellan played three seasons with the Toronto Marlboros, winning the Allan Cup in 1950. Both of McLellan's cup victories came under coach Joe Primeau.\nMcLellan turned professional in 1950, and would play most of the next four seasons with the Pittsburgh Hornets, the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League affiliate. In 1950–51, he also played for the Tulsa Oilers of the United States Hockey League. McLellan was called up to the Maple Leafs for two games in 1951–52, and they would be his only games as a player in the NHL.\nHe was traded by the Leafs to the AHL Cleveland Barons in September 1954, and played there for four years. In May 1958, the Barons told him he could make his own deal to join another team. For the 1958–59 season, McLellan was reinstated as an amateur and played for the Belleville McFarlands. The team represented Canada at the 1959 Ice Hockey World Championships, winning gold.\nMcLellan played in other minor professional leagues through the rest of his career, playing for the Milwaukee Falcons of the International Hockey League in 1959–60 and the Timmins Flyers of the Northern Ontario Hockey League in 1960–61. In 1962, he joined the Nashville Dixie Flyers of the Eastern Hockey League and played there for two seasons, before retiring as a player and becoming coach of the Nashville team.\nCoaching career.\nAfter two years coaching in Nashville–winning the league championship both seasons—McLellan rejoined the Maple Leafs organization in 1967 as the head coach of their top minor league affiliate, the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League. He spent two years in Tulsa and was then brought back to the NHL in 1969 to succeed the fired Punch Imlach as head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. McLellan was coach of the Leafs for four seasons—missing 15 games in 1971–72 due to a duodenal ulcer. He was voted NHL coach of the year in 1971. McLellan resigned as coach in 1973 to become the Leafs' assistant general manager.\nIn 1977, Imlach offered him the head coaching job with the Buffalo Sabres, but McLellan declined. The two were briefly reunited in Toronto when Imlach rejoined the Maple Leafs in 1979. A few months later, the 51-year-old McLellan died from an apparent heart attack after raking leaves at his home in Agincourt, Toronto."

        "text": "John Lang (born 7 November 1950) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and coached in the 1980s through to the 2010s. A Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative , he played his club football in Brisbane with the Eastern Suburbs Tigers and in Sydney with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. After playing, Lang became a first-grade coach in Brisbane with Easts, then in Sydney with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Penrith Panthers (with whom he won the 2003 NRL premiership) and South Sydney Rabbitohs. Lang also coached the Australian Super League test team in 1997.\nLang's son, Martin Lang, also played for the Sharks, Panthers, Queensland and Australia, and uniquely played his entire first-grade career with his father as coach.\nPlaying career.\nLang was a with Brisbane club, Easts Tigers from 1969 to 1979. He won three premierships with the club in 1972, 1977 and 1978. Also in 1972 Lang played for Brisbane in the last ever Bulimba Cup final against Toowoomba, winning 55-2.\nLang was one of only two Queenslanders selected for the 1973 Australian Kangaroo tour to France. Lang also played a test in 1974 against Great Britain and again in 1980 against New Zealand. In 1975 he was a member of the victorious Australian team which won the Rugby League World Cup.\nIn 1980, Lang accepted an offer from former Kangaroo teammate, Bob Fulton, to move to Sydney to play for Eastern Suburbs. Lang played on the losing side in the 1980 grand final against Canterbury-Bankstown.\nAlthough Lang played in nineteen state matches for Queensland, he also played for New South Wales in 1980. The inaugural year of State of Origin contests, only one match of three was played under a state of origin rules and, as a Sydney-based player, Lang was selected to play in the first match, playing a starring role in the win over Queensland. He then returned to Queensland for the third game of the series (and first ever match between the two states played under the origin selection rule), where Queensland defeated New South Wales 20–10.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring as a player at the end of his successful 1980 season, Lang returned to Brisbane to coach Brisbane Easts Tigers from 1981–1984 and again from 1990–1993. He won premierships with the club in 1983 and 1991 and runners-up in 1992 and 1993.\nIn 1994, Lang took over from Arthur Beetson as coach of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. As part of Super League, Lang took the Sharks to the 1997 Super League grand final against the Brisbane Broncos, losing 26–8. In the same year, Lang coached the Australian Super League team in five international matches against New Zealand (including a win in the inaugural ANZAC Test) and Great Britain. Although these matches are considered tests by the rest of the world's governing bodies, they are not given full test status by Australian Rugby League.\nLang was awarded the Dally M \"Coach of the Year\" in 1995 and 1999.\nIn 2000 Lang was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league.\nLang announced his intention to leave the Sharks at the end of the 2001 NRL season before it had even begun, in February, but it wasn't until late September that year that he signed with the Panthers on a three-year contract. Despite losing the first eight games of the 2002 NRL season, Lang was able to develop a side capable of contending for the finals. In his finest coaching achievement, Penrith defeated the Sydney Roosters in the 2003 NRL grand final by 18–6, thereby answering his detractors at Cronulla who argued that the Sharks could never win a premiership under Lang.\nThe Panthers finished fourth after the 2004 NRL season and were eliminated by the Bulldogs one game short of the grand final. Penrith narrowly missed the finals in 2005. In February, 2006, Panther's CEO, Glenn Matthews, announced that Matthew Elliott would take over from Lang as coach of the Panthers at the end of the 2006 season. The Panthers subsequently missed the finals and finished in the tenth position.\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs, in May 2008, appointed Lang as their football consultant, overseeing the club's structure and providing advice to head coach, Jason Taylor.\nFollowing the sacking of Jason Taylor in September 2009, Lang was appointed as the head coach of South Sydney for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. He retired from coaching at the end of the 2011 NRL season."

        "title": "2007 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2007 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the 2007 Formula 1 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 30 September 2007 at the Fuji Speedway, Oyama, Shizuoka. The 67-lap race was the fifteenth round of the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship. It was held at the recently revised track in very heavy rain and misty conditions. For the previous 20 years, the Japanese Grand Prix had been held at Suzuka Circuit, but at this race it returned to Fuji for the first time since 1977. The race was won by McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton, who also took pole position and the fastest lap of the race. Heikki Kovalainen achieved his first podium, by finishing second for the Renault team, whilst Kimi Räikkönen finished in third for Ferrari. Adrian Sutil scored Spyker's first and only point by finishing 9th and being promoted to 8th after the race.\nAs a consequence of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to twelve points over McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso. Alonso had only been two points behind Hamilton in the standings before he crashed during the race. Räikkönen's third-place finish ensured he remained in mathematical contention to clinch the drivers' title in the remaining two rounds. His Ferrari teammate, Felipe Massa, dropped out of championship contention after finishing the race in sixth position. Massa was now ten points behind Räikkönen. In the World Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were leading the standings on 170 points. McLaren would have been leading the table on 202 points had they not been given a penalty in the Hungarian Grand Prix, and then disqualified entirely due to the espionage controversy that year. BMW Sauber remained second in the standings, 78 points behind Ferrari, after scoring just two points in the race. Renault ensured that they would finish the year in third, (like BMW Sauber, they were unpassable by any other team), and were 41 points behind.\nReport.\nBackground.\nLewis Hamilton of McLaren led the Drivers' Championship by two points from his team-mate Fernando Alonso, who was a further 11 points ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen. After McLaren's exclusion from the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari had been confirmed as Constructors' Champions, following their Belgian Grand Prix one-two. They were 71 points ahead of BMW Sauber.\nThree Japanese constructors and two Japanese drivers competed in the race. Toyota were 6th in the Constructors' Championship, whilst Honda were 8th, behind their own \"B-team\" Super Aguri. Takuma Sato was 15th in the Drivers' Championship for Super Aguri, whilst compatriot Sakon Yamamoto had yet to score for Spyker F1, having debuted at the Hungarian Grand Prix.\nDavid Coulthard changed his helmet design for this race, choosing to use the helmet design of former World Rally Champion Colin McRae, who had died two weeks before the race in a helicopter crash.\nAs with the 2006 race, the event was filmed and broadcast in high-definition by Fuji Television for the domestic Japanese audience.\nQualifying.\nAlthough the weather had dried out by the time qualifying began, the track was still wet and all the drivers went out on wet tyres.\nQualifying one saw the two Spykers of Adrian Sutil and Sakon Yamamoto and the two Super Aguris of Anthony Davidson and Takuma Sato eliminated, along with Alexander Wurz in the Williams and Rubens Barrichello in the Honda. Ralf Schumacher's Toyota also collided with Yamamoto, forcing both drivers out of qualifying. Schumacher was already through to Q2, but could not set a time in the second session and so qualified 16th.\nQualifying two saw the elimination of the two Renaults of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen, David Coulthard's Red Bull, Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso and the Toyotas of Jarno Trulli as well as Schumacher.\nSebastian Vettel in the Toro Rosso and Robert Kubica in the BMW Sauber occupied row 5, just behind Jenson Button, getting his best qualifying of the season in the Honda, and Mark Webber's Red Bull. Nico Rosberg qualified 6th in the Williams, but was penalised ten places for an engine change. This meant that Vettel qualified eighth, the then best qualifying ever for Toro Rosso. Nick Heidfeld qualified 5th for BMW Sauber, and the top four was once again the two McLarens and two Ferraris. The Ferraris failed to get on the front row, with Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa 3rd and 4th respectively. Lewis Hamilton then pipped his more experienced McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso to earn the fifth pole position of his career.\nRace.\nDue to torrential rainfall, the race was started behind the safety car, which led the field for the first 19 laps. The Ferraris of Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa were forced to pit during the first few laps after starting on standard wet tyres, as opposed to \"extreme wet\" tyres, which were better-suited to the treacherously wet conditions. Ferrari boss Jean Todt later stated that the team were not informed about the requirements prior to the race, although all other teams were. During the initial safety car period, the FIA instructed the lapped driver Vitantonio Liuzzi to pass the field and catch up to the back of the queue as quickly as he safely could, as a way of gauging whether the track was ready for the race to begin in earnest.\nThe Ferraris dropped back to 20th and 21st positions respectively following the pit stops, and Massa pitted again on lap 15. When the safety car finally left the circuit, the two McLarens began the race proper at the head of the field, in front of the quick-starting Sebastian Vettel. The Toro Rosso driver had taken third place from Nick Heidfeld, after the latter and Jenson Button's Honda collided. Mark Webber reached fourth place during the first racing lap as a result of the collision, despite still suffering from the after-effects of food poisoning, having earlier vomited into his helmet during the first safety car period. A first-corner spin caused Alexander Wurz to collide heavily with Felipe Massa's Ferrari. Wurz's car sustained heavy damage and he retired on the spot.\nLater in the race, Fernando Alonso crashed out. The reigning world champion blamed aquaplaning for the accident, which once again brought out the safety car. It was the first time that a McLaren car had failed to finish during the 2007 season. During this safety car period on lap 45, third-placed Sebastian Vettel crashed into the rear of second-placed Webber in the wet conditions, Webber retiring immediately and Vettel returning to the pits to retire. Vettel had earlier became the youngest ever driver to lead a lap of a Formula One race (aged 20 years and 89 days) – his record was subsequently broken by Max Verstappen (aged 18 years and 228 days) at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix. The collision put Heikki Kovalainen's Renault in second place, which he managed to hold until the end of the race, despite repeated overtaking attempts by Kimi Räikkönen. It was Kovalainen's first podium finish. Räikkönen would eventually finish third, ahead of David Coulthard in fourth for Red Bull Racing. This was the first time that two Finnish drivers had both finished on the podium.\nOn the final lap, Felipe Massa prevailed in his battle with BMW driver Robert Kubica. The Pole had previously served a drive through penalty for colliding with Hamilton. Massa finished sixth, and Kubica seventh, behind Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault. Vitantonio Liuzzi finished in eighth, scoring the first 2007 championship points for Toro Rosso. However, these points were later removed when Liuzzi was penalised for overtaking Adrian Sutil under waved yellow flags. This promoted Sutil to eighth, giving him and the Spyker team their first and only F1 points.\nPost-race.\nFollowing the race, Sebastian Vettel received a 10-place penalty for the next race in Shanghai, China, for causing the collision with Mark Webber which put both drivers out of the race, but his punishment was later reduced to a reprimand when new evidence was presented to the FIA, prompting it to begin an investigation of Lewis Hamilton for dangerous driving and causing the collision himself. Hamilton was leading the race right in front of Webber, before suddenly braking and forcing Webber to follow suit lest he be penalised for overtaking behind the safety car; the collision occurred when Vettel's car ran into the back of Webber. Hamilton might have faced either disqualification or a grid penalty for the next race, but the FIA decided not to impose any penalty.\nProblems with the circuit.\nThe event was afflicted by poor transportation, poor facilities (including some reserved seats without a view), a lack of organization, and expensive meals that meant a simple lunch-box was sold for 10,000 yen (US$87) at the circuit.\nTransportation.\nThe free practice session on Saturday was abandoned after repeated delays due to fog, which grounded the medical helicopter. Only three drivers set a time in four minutes: Alexander Wurz (Williams-Toyota), Nico Rosberg (Williams-Toyota) and Jarno Trulli (Toyota).\nBefore the race, there were suggestions that the plan of carrying all of the 100,000 or more spectators only by shuttle bus would be impossible. To relieve people's doubts, the circuit announced that there was complete preparation for the race. These doubts were realised when, after the qualifying session on Saturday, the shuttle buses could not leave because the road on the east gate of the circuit sank around 16:00. As a result, approximately 20,000 spectators were forced to stay for four hours or more until 21:00. For the race on Sunday, only the shuttle bus was admitted for spectators as transport.\nRefund.\nOn Sunday morning, the circuit announced that they would refund spectators who had bought seats in the reserved seat area on 'C' stand, near the first corner. This was due to the low visibility which meant that the cars on the racing line were not seen at all. The cost of the tickets, 50,000 yen (US$435), was scheduled to be reimbursed to 7,000 people who were in the stand. The total cost of the refund was expected to be around 350 million yen (US$3 million). After the race on Sunday, the circuit held a press conference to apologise for problems and announced that they would refund another 85 spectators who did not arrive at the circuit until after the start of the race due to the delay of the shuttle bus. The circuit said that they would reimburse them for all the costs caused by watching the race: the transportation expenses, the hotel charges and the cost of the tickets.\nToyota bias.\nFuji Speedway prohibited spectators from setting up flags and banners supporting teams and drivers, with the exception of the Toyota F1 team whose owner also owned the circuit. Therefore, there were very few flags and banners in the event compared with other Grand Prix events. After the event, Japanese media figures such as Fuji TV F1 commentator Jun Imamiya, and Fuji TV F1 commentator and former mechanic for Benetton Formula Tetsuo Tsugawa criticised the organization of the circuit. Tsugawa mentioned:\nHowever, the event was well received by visitors in the paddock. Despite the problems and criticism, the team principal of Toyota F1, Tadashi Yamashina praised the event:\nIn 2009, the Japanese Grand Prix was held again at Suzuka, with the plan to alternate between the two circuits in subsequent years. It was suggested that this could help to prevent future shows of such flagrant parochialism. However, Toyota later announced that the Japanese Grand Prix would not be held at Fuji Speedway any more, and the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix was the last held at the circuit.\nLawsuit.\nOn 16 June 2008, 109 spectators went to Tokyo District Court and took an action against the circuit to claim total 32 million yen (US$295,500) in compensation for bad health and missing the race due to the problems with the shuttle buses."

It was the thirteenth race of the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship.\nGoing into the race, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton held a 5-point lead over team-mate Fernando Alonso in the Drivers' Championship, whilst McLaren held an 11-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. Ferrari were expected to do well at home after a one-two finish in the Turkish GP and Michael Schumacher's victory at Monza the previous year. However, McLaren dominated the traditional test session prior to the Grand Prix, with Alonso topping the time sheets on two of the four days and Hamilton and Pedro de la Rosa fastest on the other days.\nFernando Alonso took his fourth win of the season, leading home the fourth one-two finish of the season for McLaren as Lewis Hamilton finished second. It was McLaren's eighth victory at Monza and Mercedes' fourth, while Alonso became the first Spaniard to win the Italian Grand Prix. It turned out to be his last win for McLaren, and McLaren's last 1-2 finish until the 2010 Chinese Grand Prix.\nReport.\nQualifying.\nThe two Spykers of Adrian Sutil and Sakon Yamamoto were both eliminated in Q1, along with Vitantonio Liuzzi in the Toro Rosso, Takuma Sato of Super Aguri, and, surprisingly, the Toyota of Ralf Schumacher and David Coulthard's Red Bull.\nIn the second session, both the Toro Rosso of Sebastian Vettel and Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri, who had done very well to make the session, were eliminated. So were Giancarlo Fisichella in the Renault, Alexander Wurz of Williams, the Honda of Rubens Barrichello and Coulthard's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber.\nJenson Button had done excellently to put the Honda in the top 10, and he qualified tenth, on the fifth row with Jarno Trulli's Toyota. Nico Rosberg qualified his Williams eighth, alongside the second Renault of Heikki Kovalainen, who had put in a brilliant performance. Robert Kubica took 6th in the BMW Sauber, while his teammate Nick Heidfeld broke the domination of the top 4 by McLaren and Ferrari, beating the Scuderia's Kimi Räikkönen to 4th. However, it was service as normal at the very front, with Räikkönen's teammate Felipe Massa taking 3rd, and the two McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso locking out the front row, with the Spaniard just pipping his younger teammate to pole by 0.037 of a second.\nRace.\nThe top three held station from the start, but Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari jumped Nick Heidfeld in the BMW Sauber and moved into fourth. Jarno Trulli was a big loser in the Toyota, slipping from 9th to 13th, while the big winner was David Coulthard, who went from 20th to 15th in the Red Bull.\nOn lap 2, however, Coulthard crashed at Curva Grande, completely negating the influence of his brilliant start and with his car in a dangerous position the crash forced the safety car to be deployed. This allowed the Super Aguri of Anthony Davidson up into 15th.\nThe race's only other retirement was Räikkönen's teammate Felipe Massa, who retired with a suspension failure on lap 11 after running in third place. This allowed the Finn to move into third and Nico Rosberg to move into the points in his Williams.\nLewis Hamilton, running second in the McLaren, had flat-spotted his tyres earlier in the race and complained about vibration, raising fears that it might lead to a puncture similar to what happened previously in Turkey, so the team decided to play it safe and pit slightly earlier than scheduled, on lap 18, dropping Hamilton down to 6th place, behind Räikkönen, the two BMW Saubers of Heidfeld and Robert Kubica, and Heikki Kovalainen's Renault. Räikkönen then took the lead as Hamilton's teammate Fernando Alonso pitted from the lead on lap 20.\nHamilton moved back to third place, behind Räikkönen and Alonso, after the two BMW Saubers and Kovalainen pitted, but as the Ferrari driver emerged from his pitstop, Hamilton was still behind. With the extra grip provided by the softer tyres, Hamilton made a move down the inside of turn one to recover second place from Räikkönen, who didn't defend as he had the harder compound tyres and was still suffering from the neck injury he got during his practice accident. Alonso retained the lead.\nThere were no further changes at the front, and Alonso led home by six seconds from Hamilton, with Räikkönen completing the podium. Heidfeld finished in fourth just four seconds ahead of his teammate Kubica, with Rosberg still in close contention in sixth. Kovalainen was seventh, and Jenson Button rounded out the points in a rare foray into the points paying positions for the Honda team."

        "text": "The United States had recently entered World War I, and the soccer world felt the effects as increasing numbers of players joined the armed forces to wage battle in Europe. Soccer was not as hard-hit as some other sports, but all leagues felt the impact; in fact the Čechie team of Chicago lost every member of its roster to enlistment. The United States Soccer Football Association issued a call to its member associations for teams to resist the temptation to strengthen their teams at the expense of others — when wealthy, but decimated teams eye the poorer but complete teams, their wallets and checkbooks should remain pocketed in the name of fair play. A welcome consequence of the war situation was a willingness of the USFA's own warring factions to end their dispute and work together in relative harmony during those trying times. Many soccer organizations launched fund raising campaigns and benefit matches to raise money to provide support for U.S. soldiers through, among other means, the provision of soccer equipment and gear to enhance their recreational opportunities. One such project was the Soccer Football Chain Letter Fund launched by Thomas Cahill and the USFA.\nOther welcome events included record attendance figures in some late-round games of the National Challenge Cup that were well promoted. One of the major topics of discussion was the pros and cons of substitutes. At the time the laws did not specifically allow nor outlaw substitutes per se, but the consensus was that eventually they would become a reality. For the 1917-18 year, the USFA reported receipts of $6,318.64 and disbursements of $3,034.39, giving the USFA a net worth of $2,784.25 in cash and one $500.00 Liberty Bond.\nBracket.\n\"Home teams listed on top of bracket\"\n(*) replay after tied match"

He is currently a radio color analyst for the San Francisco 49ers, and previously an NFL analyst for Fox television and co-host of \"Movin' the Chains\" on Sirius XM NFL Radio.\nHigh school career.\nTim played for the Oak Grove Eagles high school varsity football team from 1983 to 1985 where he started on both the offensive and defensive line and was a Mercury-News All-CCS selection.\nCollege career.\nA two-time All-American (1988, 1989) at the University of Southern California, Ryan is the all-time leading tackler in school history. The former team captain led the Trojans to three Rose Bowls and holds the team season-record for sacks with 20.\nRyan started the season opener against Illinois in 1986 as the first true freshman since Riki Ellison in 1978.\nProfessional career.\nRyan was a third-round draft choice (61st pick overall) in the 1990 NFL draft. He played for the Chicago Bears between 1990 and 1993.\nSportscasting career.\nRyan has been commenting NFL games since 2002. For 12 years, he served as a color analyst for \"Fox NFL\" telecasts, teaming with various play-by-play announcers including Chris Myers, Sam Rosen, Curt Menefee, and Ron Pitts. (Ryan is not to be confused with another sportscaster also named Tim Ryan, who called play-by-play for Fox in 1998.) Ryan also teamed with Matt Vasgersian for the 2009 Fiesta Bowl, replacing Terry Donahue and Pat Haden. He also worked for Sirius NFL Radio (Channel 88), hosting \"Movin' the Chains\" from 3-7pm with Pat Kirwan and doing analysis for San Francisco 49ers preseason games.

Since the onset of the 49ers 2019 season, Ryan has teamed up with play-by-play announcer Greg Papa on radio broadcasts. In December 2019, Ryan was suspended as the 49ers' color analyst due to a controversial comment made on the Murph and Mac show on KNBR Radio about Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson's success at faking hand-offs due to his dark skin and the dark color of the football, and the dark color of his uniform."

        "text": "Jesús Fernando Martínez Álvarez (born October 10, 1988) is a Dominican former professional baseball outfielder. Martínez signed with the New York Mets in 2005, and made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 2009. He also played in MLB for the Houston Astros. He bats left-handed and throws right-handed. He was one of 14 players suspended for taking part in the Biogenesis baseball scandal. He played for Team Spain in the 2019 European Baseball Championship. He then played for the team at the Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament, in Italy in September 2019.\nCareer.\nNew York Mets.\nMartínez signed with the Mets in July 2005 as an international free agent, when he was 16 years old. Mets general manager Omar Minaya, known for his ability to attract Latin American talent to the Mets, lured Martínez with a signing bonus of $1.4 million. Minaya said of the signing \"What we saw in [Martinez] was a 16-year-old kid with power, great ability and great character, above everything else.”\nMartínez had played center field in the minor leagues since the 2007 season with Double-A Binghamton. He was selected to both the 2007 and 2008 All-Star Futures Games. Martínez was considered by many to be a potential 5-tool player at the major league level.\n\"Baseball America\" named him as the Mets Number One Prospect for 2007 and 2008.\nMartinez then saw his status as a blue chip prospect decline over the next few years, due in large part to his frequent stints on the disabled list. For example, Martinez was ranked as the Number 1 prospect in the Mets' organization by Scout.com in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, he was dropped to Number 4. Similarly, ESPN Scout Keith Law ranked Martinez as the Number 10 overall prospect in 2008, and then as the Number 16 overall prospect in 2009, but dropped him to Number 73 overall in 2010. Due to his accumulated time on the major league roster, Martinez' prospect status expired after 2010.\nAfter batting .291 with 8 home runs and leading the International League with 25 extra-base hits in 42 games with AAA Buffalo, Martínez was called up to the major leagues on May 26 as José Reyes and Ryan Church were placed on the disabled list. He went 0–3 with 2 strikeouts, a fielder's choice, a hit by pitch, and an RBI. He hit his first career home run against the Brewers on June 30 in a 6–3 loss.\nAfter appearing in 11 games for the Mets in the majors and batting just .227 with an On Base Percentage of .261. The Mets waived Martinez on January 9, 2012 after years of injuries and disappointing progress. \nHouston Astros.\nOn January 11, 2012, Martinez was claimed off waivers by the Houston Astros. He was designated for assignment on May 6, 2013.\nIn 2012 Martinez played well for the Astros AAA team with a slash line of .314 / .367 / .507. However, Martinez struggled to perform in the Majors. The next year Martinez struggled in both the minors and majors for Houston.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn June 18, 2013, Martínez was traded from the Astros to the New York Yankees for minor league pitcher Charles Basford.\nOn August 5, 2013, Martinez was suspended 50 games by the MLB for violating its drug policy and connection to Biogenesis."

It was a single-elimination tournament with four rounds. Villanova and Connecticut tied for the best regular season conference record. Based on tie-breakers, Connecticut was awarded the #1 seed.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Syracuse Orange won the tournament for the second consecutive season and fifth time overall, and were awarded an automatic bid to the 2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. As a 9-seed, the Orange are the lowest seeded team to win the Big East tournament, and became the first school to win four games in the tournament. Gerry McNamara of Syracuse was given the Dave Gavitt Trophy, awarded to the tournament's most outstanding player.\nSyracuse's Run.\nThis tournament is best remembered for Syracuse's improbable run to the championship as a #9 seed, with McNamara pulling off excellent 3-point shooting and some improbable buzzer beaters and last-second shots to lead them. In the first game, after Devan Downey of Cincinnati stole the inbounds pass with ten seconds left and was fouled, he made one of two to put the Bearcats up two points. However, with just a half second left, McNamara made a running one-handed three-pointer to secure the victory, 74–73.\nAfter jumping out to a big lead against Connecticut in the second game, Uconn battled back for much of the game until they finally took their first lead of the game with 30 seconds to play. Incredibly, McNamara was the hero for Syracuse again, hitting a 30-foot three-pointer with 5 seconds left to send the game into overtime. The Orange went on to win 86–84, holding off the Huskies on a last-second effort. McNamara finished with thirteen assists, ten in the first half alone.\nThey faced Georgetown in the semifinals in their attempt to become the first team to win the Big East tournament as one of the teams forced to play on the first day, requiring four wins in a row. The Hoyas went up early, holding a fifteen-point lead at the half. McNamara sat out for ten minutes because of a nagging groin injury. Surprising everyone, McNamara came out in the second half and drained five three-pointers, including one with 45 seconds left and the Orange down four. Demetris Nichols knocked away the inbounds pass for Georgetown, allowing McNamara to take possession and rush down the floor with time running out. He passed to an open Eric Devendorf who laid the winning shot in with 1.5 seconds to go. The Orange had advanced to the finals, beating Georgetown, 58–57.\nAfter improbably winning three straight games either in overtime or by one point, they got a slightly easier win in the finals against Pittsburgh, winning 65–61. The Orange led most of the game, but midway through the second half, the Panthers had taken the lead. McNamara quickly made a three-point shot after that and Josh Wright made four clutch free throws in the final minute to secure the historic championship. Syracuse had finished just 7–9 in the Big East that year, and would have likely been left out of the NCAA tournament had they not pulled off at least two of the four wins. They would go on to lose to Texas A&amp;M in the first round of the tournament.\nBracket.\nNote: By finishing below twelfth place during the regular season, DePaul, Providence, St. John's, and South Florida did not qualify for the tournament.\nAwards.\nDave Gavitt Trophy (Most Outstanding Player): Gerry McNamara, Syracuse\nAll-Tournament Team"

        "text": "Indian National Cricket Selectors are a committee of cricket administrators, usually composed of former cricket players and is appointed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Their responsibility is to select members of cricket teams to represent India at various levels. The term for selectors was increased from one year to two years in 2006, with a provision for an additional year based on performance. The selectors are appointed by the BCCI's three-member Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), which currently includes Sulakshana Naik, Ashok Malhotra and Jatin Paranjpe.\nHistory.\nUntil 18 November 2022, Chetan Sharma served as a chief selector, and some members were: Debashish Mohanty, Harvinder Singh\nand Sunil Joshi. This panel was shut down after an unsuccessful tour of the Indian men's team in the 2022 T20 world cup. On 4 July 2023, Ajit Agarkar was appointed as the Chairman of the Senior Men's Selection Committee. The current five-man selection committee, headed by Agarkar, consists of Shiv Sundar Das, Subroto Banerjee, Salil Ankola, and Sridharan Sharath.\nSelection Committees.\nThere are two selection committees :\nSenior Selection Committee.\nThis panel selects players for the senior Indian team. It comprises five members from five zones of India: Central, North, West, South, and East.\nAll India Women's Selection Committee.\nThis committee selects players for the Indian women's cricket team. This committee comprises only women who have represented India at an international level. Similar to the men's selection committee, its members are appointed from five zones of the nation. The following are the present members of this committee:\nJunior Selection Committee.\nThe 5 member committee for Junior players is as follows:\n1. VS Thilak Naidu (South Zone) - Chairman\n2. Pathik Patel (West Zone)\n3. Ranadeb Bose (East Zone)\n4. Kishan Mohan (North Zone)\n5. Harvinder Singh Sodhi (Central Zone)\nComposition.\nThe selection committee consists of five members and a convenor. The five members of the selection committee, captain and coach have voting rights on team selection. The convenor of the senior selection team is the incumbent Sr. Secretary, the BCCI, and that of the junior selection team is the Jr. Secretary.\nThe five members of the selection committee were traditionally selected from the five cricket zones: North Zone, Central Zone, West Zone, East Zone and South Zone. One of the five members is chosen by the BCCI as the chairman of the committee. The BCCI scrapped the zonal system in 2016 under pressure from the Lodha committee recommendation.\nThe Captain and Coach are invited to the selection committee meetings to present their opinions on team players. Moreover, they have voting rights in team selection.\nControversies.\nIssues with the composition of the Selection Committee based on the Zonal system\nLodha Committee Recommendations and Subsequent Changes.\nQuestions raised on selectors.\nThe national selectors often get slammed by many due to its irregular and unintelligible selection criteria and its process. Selectors expected to selects players by considering their performance in domestic cricket's top tournaments such Ranji, Vijay Hazare Trophy to choose players for Test and ODI teams respectively. But often its alleged that they select players by considering their performance in IPL and ignore consistent performance in domestic cricket's. Many including Sunil Gavaskar, Abhinav Mukund has slammed them (selectors- BCCI) for doing this. National selectors often select players for Test, ODI teams by considering players performance in T20 format (IPL specifically) instead considering Ranji trophy (First class) and Vijay Hazare trophy (One day format) national tournaments.\nFinance.\nIn August 2018, the Committee of Administrators increased the salary of the national selectors in a meeting. In the meeting, it was decided that the remuneration of the members of the selection committee would be increased to INR 90 lakhs (US$110,000) (from INR 60 lakhs) per annum, while the chairman of the panel would now receive INR 1 crore (US$130,000) (from INR 80 lakhs) per annum.\nMeanwhile, the remuneration of the members of the junior selection committee has been increased to INR 60 lakhs (US$75,000) per annum, with the chairman of the panel now receiving INR 65 lakhs (US$81,000) per annum.\nThe salaries of the women's selection committee have also been increased, with the members now receiving INR 25 lakhs (US$31,000) per annum and the chief selector set to accept INR 30 lakhs (US$38,000) per annum."

        "text": "The 2008 UEFA Champions League final was a football match that took place on 21 May 2008 at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, to determine the winner of the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. It was contested by Manchester United and Chelsea, making it an all-English final for the first time in the history of the competition; it was only the third time that two clubs from the same country had contested the final, after 2000 and 2003. It was the first European Cup final played in Russia, and hence the easternmost final in the tournament's history. It also marked the 100th anniversary of Manchester United's first league triumph, the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, and the 40th anniversary of United's first European Cup triumph in 1968. It was Manchester United's third European Cup final after 1968 and 1999, while it was Chelsea's first.\nManchester United won the match 6–5 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw after extra time. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Manchester United in the 26th minute with a header from a cross by Wes Brown, but Frank Lampard equalised shortly before half-time. The second half and most of extra time passed without incident until Chelsea's Didier Drogba was sent off for slapping Nemanja Vidić four minutes from the end. In the penalty shoot-out, Ronaldo missed Manchester United's third kick, giving John Terry the chance to win the title for Chelsea, only for his shot to hit the post when he slipped as he was about to kick the ball. Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's effort from Chelsea's seventh kick to secure Manchester United's third European Cup title.\nMore than 67,000 people watched the game in the stadium, along with more than 17.5 million television viewers in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In addition to prize money received from earlier in the competition, Manchester United received €7 million for winning the final, while Chelsea received €4 million. As winners, Manchester United went on to play in the 2008 UEFA Super Cup, losing 2–1 to 2007–08 UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg, and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup, which they won after beating 2008 Copa Libertadores winners LDU Quito 1–0 in the final.\nBackground.\nManchester United and Chelsea had played each other 150 times prior to the Champions League final, including 18 meetings in domestic cup competitions (the FA Cup, the Football League Cup and the FA Community Shield). Due to various historical restrictions regarding the number of teams from the same country entering European competitions, they had never met in Europe before. Manchester United held the upper hand in the teams' previous meetings, winning 65 times to Chelsea's 41, with 44 draws. Their cup record was equally good, winning 10 of their 18 meetings, with 4 draws and 4 Chelsea wins. However, honours were even in cup finals, with Manchester United having won the 1994 FA Cup final 4–0, while Chelsea won the 2007 FA Cup final 1–0, the last cup game between the two sides. Manchester United responded to defeat in the 2007 FA Cup Final by beating Chelsea in the 2007 FA Community Shield the following August, winning 3–0 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in normal time. They went on to claim their 17th league title at the end of the 2007–08 Premier League season, finishing two points ahead of Chelsea. Both teams went into the final game of the season level on points, but United were ahead of Chelsea because of their superior goal difference, meaning United's 2–0 win against Wigan Athletic on the final day made Chelsea's late draw with Bolton Wanderers irrelevant. In the two sides' league meetings that season, United won 2–0 at Old Trafford in Avram Grant's first game in charge of Chelsea on 23 September 2007, while Chelsea won 2–1 at Stamford Bridge in the return game on 26 April 2008.\nBecause of the aforementioned restrictions on entry to UEFA competitions, Manchester United had only met English opposition in Europe twice before, while Chelsea had far more experience against English opposition, having played 12 matches against compatriot clubs, winning five, drawing five and losing just two. There had been two previous Champions League finals between teams from the same country: in 2000, when Real Madrid beat fellow Spanish side Valencia 3–0 at the Stade de France; and in 2003, when Italian sides Milan and Juventus played out a 0–0 draw at Old Trafford before Milan won 3–2 on penalties.\nBoth sides had a connection to the early history of European football; Chelsea were invited to take part in the inaugural European Cup in 1955–56 as champions of England, only to be denied entry by The Football League, allowing Manchester United to become the first English entrants in the competition the following season. In February 1958, eight Manchester United players were killed in the Munich air disaster, when the aeroplane carrying their team back from a match in Belgrade crashed while attempting to take off from a refuelling stop in Munich. Manager Matt Busby was seriously injured in the crash and almost died as a result, but he rebuilt the team, and in May 1968, Manchester United became the first English winners of the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the 1968 European Cup final. Chelsea won their first European trophy three years later, when they beat Real Madrid 2–1 in the 1971 European Cup Winners' Cup final replay after a 1–1 draw in the first match. Both Chelsea and Manchester United won that same competition during the 1990s – first Manchester United beat Barcelona 2–1 in the 1991 final (followed by victory over Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 Super Cup), and then Chelsea beat VfB Stuttgart in the 1998 final (followed by victory over Real Madrid in the 1998 Super Cup, their most recent European success at the time). Manchester United then won their second European Cup the following year, beating Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.\nRoad to the final.\nManchester United.\nManchester United were drawn in Group F along with Roma, Sporting CP and Dynamo Kyiv. United won their first five group games; they first travelled to Lisbon, where Cristiano Ronaldo's header secured a 1–0 win against his old club, Sporting. Next was another 1–0 win at home to Roma, followed by back-to-back four-goal victories over Dynamo Kyiv (4–2 in Ukraine and 4–0 at Old Trafford). United secured top spot in the group with a 2–1 win at home to Sporting in their fifth game. They travelled to Roma for the final group game, in which both teams were already guaranteed to progress; it finished as a 1–1 draw, with Gerard Piqué scoring his second goal for the club before Mancini's equaliser. United finished with 16 points, the most of all the group winners.\nIn the first knockout round, United were drawn against Lyon. They drew the away leg 1–1, thanks to a late equaliser from Carlos Tevez, before winning the second leg 1–0 – Ronaldo scoring the only goal – to ensure a 2–1 aggregate victory and a place in the quarter-finals, where they were again drawn against Roma.\nThe quarter-final matches represented the fifth and sixth times these two clubs had met in Europe in just over 12 months; they had met at the same stage of the previous season's competition and then again in the group stage this season. United went to Rome and secured a 2–0 win with a first-half header from Ronaldo and a second-half goal tapped in by Wayne Rooney. United went on to secure the tie in the second leg with a 1–0 win, their record 11th consecutive home Champions League win.\nThe semi-final pitted United against Barcelona; the teams had not met since the group stage of the 1998–99 tournament, the last time United won it. The teams also had identical records going into the semi-final, each having won eight and drawn two of their 10 games, scoring 18 goals and conceding just five. The first leg at the Camp Nou saw United spend most of the game defending, while Barcelona tried to pass the ball around them. United were awarded a penalty in the first minute, but Ronaldo sent the ball wide, hitting the stanchion behind the goal. That was as close as either team got to a goal in the first leg and it ended 0–0. The second leg at Old Trafford was played at a higher tempo, and United won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Paul Scholes after 14 minutes. This result extended United's consecutive home win record in the Champions League to 12 and ensured that they reached the final unbeaten.\nIn reaching the final, United won nine and drew three of their 12 matches, dwarfing their record of four wins and six draws in the 10 games they took to reach the final in 1999 (when teams advanced from the group stage directly into the quarter-finals). United scored 19 goals en route to the final, Ronaldo scoring seven of them, more than any other player.\nChelsea.\nIn the group stage, Chelsea were drawn into Group B, along with Schalke 04 of Germany, Rosenborg of Norway and Spanish club Valencia. Chelsea's first match in the group was against Rosenborg at Stamford Bridge, where they were held to a 1–1 draw. Two days later, manager José Mourinho left Chelsea by mutual consent, and was replaced by their director of football, former Israel national team coach Avram Grant. Chelsea's second match was against Valencia, whom they beat 2–1, leaving Chelsea with four points from their two matches. They then faced Schalke in their next two matches; the first was played at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea winning 2–0, while the return match in Gelsenkirchen ended in a 0–0 draw. Chelsea's final two matches in their group resulted in a 4–0 victory away to Rosenborg and a goalless draw at home to Valencia. Chelsea progressed as group winners with 12 points from six games.\nChelsea faced Greek side Olympiacos in the first knockout round. The first leg in Athens ended in a 0–0 draw, but a 3–0 win in the second leg, with goals from Michael Ballack, Frank Lampard and Salomon Kalou, saw Chelsea through to the quarter-finals. There, they were drawn against Fenerbahçe of Turkey. The first leg was held at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul, and ended in a 2–1 defeat, as Deivid made up for an early own goal by scoring the winner nine minutes from time after Colin Kazim-Richards' equaliser. Chelsea won the second leg at Stamford Bridge 2–0, with goals from Ballack and Lampard, to claim a 3–2 aggregate victory over the Turkish side.\nChelsea faced fellow English club Liverpool in the semi-finals. This was the fourth year in succession that these teams had met in the Champions League, following semi-final meetings in 2004–05 and 2006–07, and two group stage matches in 2005–06. The first leg at Anfield was a 1–1 draw, in which Chelsea got a 95th-minute equaliser through a John Arne Riise own goal after Dirk Kuyt had put Liverpool 1–0 up just before half-time. Chelsea won the second leg 3–2 after extra time, with two goals from Didier Drogba and one from Lampard sending the Blues through to the first Champions League final in their history.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow was selected as the venue for the match at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 4 October 2006. The committee – who decided the venue for the 2009 final and the 2008 and 2009 UEFA Cup finals at the same meeting – based their decision on a number of factors, including stadium capacity, safety and security facilities, and accessibility. The other venues in contention were the Estadio Olímpico in Seville, the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Wembley Stadium in London, and the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which was chosen to host the 2009 final.\nThis was the easternmost final in the history of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League. It was the first time the competition's showpiece match had been played in Russia, although the Luzhniki Stadium had previously played host to the 1999 UEFA Cup final, in which Italian club Parma beat French side Marseille 3–0. Because of the difference in time zones, the match kicked off at 22:45 Moscow Time, making it the first Champions League final to start on one day and finish in the next.\nOriginally known as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium, the venue opened in 1956 as a new national stadium for the Soviet Union national football team. In 1973, it served as the principal venue for the seventh Summer Universiade, before going on to perform the same function at the 1980 Summer Olympics. By this point, the stadium's capacity was 103,000; however, renovations in the mid-1990s reduced the capacity to just under 85,000. The stadium was given five-star status by UEFA in 1998, before hosting the UEFA Cup final the following year. To help the stadium cope with cold Russian winters, the grass pitch was replaced by an artificial FieldTurf surface in 2002. Although UEFA allowed matches in earlier rounds and European Championship qualifying to be played on the synthetic surface, they mandated that the Champions League final should be played on natural grass. The FieldTurf was removed after Russia's UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match against England on 17 October, but the first grass pitch laid was deemed to be too bumpy. Another pitch was laid less than three weeks before the final at a cost of £160,000, using turf shipped in from Slovakia, but groundsman Matt Frost said, \"I'm totally disappointed with the whole project and what we are presenting for the final.\" UEFA's director of communications, William Gaillard, said the pitch might not look as good as they had hoped to television audiences, but was confident that it would be fine to play on.\nAs part of the marketing for each Champions League final since 1997, UEFA commissions a unique design concept inspired by the cultural and historical heritage of the host city. The 2008 final's design was announced on 31 October 2007 in a ceremony at the Luzhniki Stadium, attended by the ambassador for the final, former Russian goalkeeper Rinat Dasayev. The design was based on a colour scheme of deep red and gold, inspired by the predominant colours of Red Square, the Kremlin and the gold domes of Moscow's cathedrals, and featured images of the Moscow skyline, as well as the UEFA Champions League logo and trophy rendered in a Russian artistic style, with text in a font similar to Cyrillic script.\nAs has also taken place for every Champions League final since 1997, a ceremonial handover of the UEFA Champions League trophy was held in the host city; the 2008 ceremony was at the GUM Centre in Moscow's Red Square on 3 April 2008. On behalf of 2007 champions Milan, their technical operations director and former player Leonardo, and club director Umberto Gandini presented the trophy to UEFA president Michel Platini, who passed it on to the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, for it to be displayed in five cities around the country – Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Krasnodar, Saint Petersburg and Samara – before returning to Moscow ahead of the final. Also in attendance at the ceremony were final ambassador Rinat Dasayev and Russian Football Union president Vitaly Mutko.\nTicketing and supporters.\nAlthough the Luzhniki Stadium had a usual capacity of almost 85,000 spectators, that was reduced to 69,500 for the final. Of those tickets, approximately 21,000 were reserved for each finalist club, with a further 10,500 available for purchase by the general public via the UEFA website. Recipients of those tickets were determined by a random ballot following an online application process that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008. Tickets were available in three categories, priced at €80, €140 and €200 depending on their location in the stadium. UEFA received around 125,000 applications for tickets from the general public over the course of the three-week application process.\nThe clubs were able to distribute their tickets however they wished; Manchester United chose to make their allocation available to all Executive Seat Holders and any Season Ticket Holders who had successfully applied for a ticket to at least one of the club's five away Champions League matches between the group stage and the quarter-finals, while Chelsea opened up applications to all club members and season ticket holders.\nManchester United chief executive David Gill expressed disappointment that his club had only been allocated 21,000 tickets for their supporters, claiming that they could have potentially sold up to 100,000. While Manchester United managed to sell out their entire allocation, UEFA's William Gaillard indicated that Chelsea still had \"up to a couple of thousand\" tickets unsold the day before the game, despite claims by Chelsea's chief operations officer, Ron Gourlay, to the contrary.\nOne of the major concerns for English fans attending the final was the acquisition of visas for entry into Russia. However, after a period of negotiations between representatives of Russia, the United Kingdom, UEFA and the two clubs, it was agreed that fans with tickets for the match would not require a visa, provided they were also able to produce a passport with at least six months before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into Russia. The visa-free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 May and 23 May, but this was later extended to an eight-day period lasting from 17 to 25 May. Because of the difficulty and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa, fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to Moscow by Gaillard, who also warned fans about Russia's strict laws regarding the consumption of alcohol.\nAlthough the two clubs claimed to have sold most of the 42,000 tickets allocated to them, only about 25,000 fans were said to have travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According to the head of the Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, \"The Moscow Times\" reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.\nMatch ball.\nThe match ball for the final was the Adidas Finale Moscow, the eighth in the Adidas Finale range. The ball's design was based around the \"starball\" pattern, inspired by the UEFA Champions League logo; the stars are dark red with gold detailing, tying in with the overall design concept for the final. Technically, the ball is based on the Adidas Europass, which was used at UEFA Euro 2008 later that summer; it has the same 14-panel configuration as the Adidas Teamgeist, but with the proprietary surface texture developed for the Europass. The ball was unveiled at a ceremony in Moscow's Manezhnaya Square, attended by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor, former Germany player and coach Franz Beckenbauer, final ambassador Rinat Dasayev and Russian Football Union president Vitaly Mutko.\nOfficials.\nThe referee for the final was 40-year-old Slovakian referee Ľuboš Micheľ, the first Slovak to take charge of a European Cup final. His team was completed by fellow Slovak assistant referees Roman Slyško and Martin Balko, and fourth official Vladimír Hriňák. Having presided over the 2003 UEFA Cup final, Micheľ was the second man to referee the finals of both the Champions League and UEFA Cup since the latter changed to a single-legged affair in 1998; the other was Pierluigi Collina, who had been the referee in Manchester United's last Champions League final appearance in 1999. Micheľ began refereeing in 1987 at the age of 19, and took charge of his first top-flight game in 1993. That same year, he was promoted to the FIFA list of international referees, and in November 1993, he refereed his first international match – a UEFA Under-21 Championship qualifier between San Marino and England.\nMicheľ's first UEFA Champions League matches came in the 1998–99 season, including Manchester United's 5–0 win over Brøndby in the group stage. Up to the 2008 final, he had refereed 55 Champions League matches (including qualifying), notably the second leg of the semi-final between Chelsea and Liverpool in 2005, in which Liverpool's Luis García scored a controversial goal that Micheľ chose to allow. He was also selected to referee at the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, and the European Championships in 2004 and 2008.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nSir Alex Ferguson guaranteed a place in the starting line-up for Paul Scholes, after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension. Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier, with Owen Hargreaves starting on the right side of midfield in a 4–4–2 formation in place of Park Ji-sung, who did not even make the substitutes bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing, where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right-back Michael Essien. This went against the prediction of \"The Guardian\"s David Pleat, who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole would be key to the final. Ferguson hoped his substitutes might have a big impact on the match, just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999, when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich. A week before the game, Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in the starting line-up; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes.\nThe day before the match, Chelsea manager Avram Grant predicted that the game would throw up few tactical surprises due to the two teams' knowledge of each other from the domestic league. Like Ferguson, Grant made only one change to the team that started Chelsea's final league game against Bolton 10 days earlier; centre-back Ricardo Carvalho overcame a recurring back injury to start in place of Alex. Captain John Terry (dislocated elbow) and striker Didier Drogba (knee) also recovered from injuries suffered against Bolton to start the match. Florent Malouda retained his place on the left wing ahead of Salomon Kalou, while Michael Essien continued at right-back, rather than in his preferred midfield position, ahead of Paulo Ferreira – who did not even make the bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final – and Juliano Belletti. Ashley Cole also started despite hurting his right ankle in training the day before the game under a heavy challenge from Claude Makélélé; Cole's replacement would have likely been Wayne Bridge, but he recovered sufficiently that Bridge was not even included in the matchday squad as cover.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nAfter a fairly cagey first 21 minutes, the first major incident of the game occurred when Scholes and Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to pick out a cross for Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech; it was the first time United had scored in the first half of a European final, and the first time Chelsea had gone behind in their three final appearances. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United spent the rest of the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.\nChelsea survived the pressure, as Tevez failed to connect with a low cross from Rooney, and equalised in the final minute of the first half. The goal followed a long-range shot by Michael Essien, which deflected first off Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand. The ball's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing, leaving Lampard, who had made a run from deep, with a simple finish. In celebration, Lampard looked up and pointed to the sky with both hands in memory of his mother, Pat, who had died a month earlier. At the end of the first half, Sir Alex Ferguson confronted referee Micheľ, \"jabbing out an angry finger and spitting out a few choice words\".\nSecond half.\nLampard's equaliser at the end of the first half led to a transformed Chelsea in the second, and they kept United on the back foot for long periods. Nevertheless, the Red Devils managed to contain most of Chelsea's attacks. Chelsea had a few opportunities to take the lead, with Essien breaking free of United's defence in the 54th minute, only for his left-footed shot to curl well over the goal. Chelsea's closest opportunity to take the lead came in the 77th minute when a Drogba shot struck the post from out. The Ivorian striker came very close to turning Joe Cole's low cross home for the winner four minutes from time, but fired wide. Ryan Giggs was then introduced in place of Scholes, making a record 759th appearance for Manchester United.\nExtra time.\nThe game moved into extra time, and both teams had chances to score a vital second goal; first, Lampard hit the underside of the bar with a left-footed shot after the ball was played in to him with a disguised pass from Ballack, then Giggs stabbed the ball left-footed towards goal instead of sweeping it with his weaker right foot, only to see it headed off the line by Terry. Late in the second half of extra time, the ball was put out of play so players could be treated for cramp. In returning the ball to Chelsea, Tevez put it out for another throw-in deep in Chelsea's half then signalled to his teammates to put pressure on the restart. Terry and Ballack reacted angrily to this and were joined by several of their teammates, while Manchester United's players rushed in to protect Tevez. Ultimately, most of the 22 players were involved in the fracas. Amid the melée, assistant referee Martin Balko saw Drogba slap Nemanja Vidić and reported the incident to referee Micheľ. After showing a yellow card to Ballack, Micheľ showed a red card to Drogba for violent conduct, making him only the second player in history to be sent off in a European Cup final after Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in 2006. In preparation for the penalty shoot-out, both clubs made last-minute substitutions; Manchester United brought on Anderson in place of Brown, while Chelsea took off Makélélé in favour of Belletti.\nPenalty shoot-out.\nAs the match went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side to go first in the shoot-out, which would be taken at the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was next up, shooting powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Belletti with his first touch of the game. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.\nLampard then put Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves levelled things up with a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then knew he had to score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.\nWith the first penalty of sudden death, Anderson – like Belletti – scored with his first kick of the game. Kalou then sent Van der Sar the wrong way to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to indicate to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United for the third time in their history.\nPost-match.\nHaving missed what would have been Chelsea's winning penalty, John Terry had to be consoled by his manager, Avram Grant. The Manchester United players formed a guard of honour for Chelsea, lining up in two opposite rows at the foot of the steps up to the presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through. As Drogba had been sent off during the game, he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant; when he returned to pitch level, Grant tossed his own medal into the crowd. After Chelsea's team received their medals, Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton, who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968, led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director. UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals, but Charlton declined to accept his medal; he later donated it to the club museum. When all the players had received their medals, Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy, which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for injured club captain Gary Neville – lifted together.\nUnited manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side deserved to win the game despite Chelsea performing better in the second half, and acknowledged the historical significance of the win, which came 40 years after the club's first European Cup title and 50 years after the Munich air disaster. He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: \"I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky – magnificent.\" Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad. Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side's shoot-out victory, saying, \"In my opinion I played well in the game, scored a goal, and then missed the penalty. It would have been the worst day of my life. We deserved to win as we played better in the whole game. It means everything to me, we have won both trophies, it is the best day in my life.\" He then attempted to quash speculation about his future and a potential transfer to Real Madrid, saying, \"I am going to stay.\"\nCarvalho, Lampard and Grant all refused to point the finger of blame at Terry, but assistant manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due to take one of the first five penalties (if Drogba had not been sent off, the Ivorian would have taken the fifth penalty). Chelsea offered Terry counselling to help cope with having missed his penalty and lost the match. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing. Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing his lack of warm-up time.\nFollowing the loss, Grant's future as manager was thrown into doubt, and owner Roman Abramovich (who attended the final), chief executive Peter Kenyon, director Eugene Tenenbaum and chairman Bruce Buck were reportedly already seeking a replacement for Grant the day after the game. Buck was unimpressed with Chelsea's second-place league finish and being runners-up in the Champions League, saying, \"We have very high expectations at Chelsea and a couple of second-place finishes is just not good enough for us.\" Grant was officially sacked three days after the match. Buck also confirmed plans to trim the Chelsea squad by selling at least three players, and said that discussions were due to take place regarding Drogba's future with the club, after the striker reportedly expressed a desire to leave earlier in the season.\nIn Moscow, around 6,000 police were on duty to prevent a repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup final riots in Manchester a week earlier, but police reported that none of the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to watch the game outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; police arrested 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm, drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway. Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident.\nManchester United had originally intended to hold a parade through the streets of Manchester to celebrate their Double triumph on their return from Moscow on 22 May. However, following the violence that occurred at the UEFA Cup final, Greater Manchester Police determined that any victory parade could only take place later in the summer. The public parade was ultimately cancelled, but fans were given the opportunity to photograph the players with the Premier League and Champions League trophies before Manchester United's home friendly against Juventus on 6 August 2008.\nMedia.\nBroadcasters.\nThe match was shown simultaneously in the United Kingdom by free-to-air channel ITV1 and subscription channel Sky Sports 1, whose networks in 2005 had won the rights to broadcast UEFA Champions League matches for three seasons from 2006–07 to 2008–09. Sky acted as the host broadcaster for UEFA, providing pictures to all other networks covering the final with around 30 cameras and 100 crew members. The ITV broadcast was led by Steve Rider, with Clive Tyldesley commentating, David Pleat as an analyst, and Andy Townsend and Mark Hughes as in-studio pundits. Sky's team consisted of presenter Richard Keys, joined in the studio by Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp, and Ruud Gullit via phone, with commentary from Martin Tyler and analysis from Andy Gray.\nITV's viewing figures peaked at 14.6 million in the five minutes from 22:30, during the penalty shoot-out. During the match (from 19:45 to 22:35), the number of viewers averaged at 11.1 million (46% of the total audience), while the average over the entire broadcast from 19:00 to 23:15 was 9.6 million (43% of the total). Meanwhile, Sky Sports' peak was 2 million viewers in a five-minute period near the end of extra time; their average for the match was 1.8 million, and 1.3 million for the full broadcast. In Ireland, RTÉ Two's coverage of the match reached a one-minute peak of 998,000 (62% share), with an average over their four-hour broadcast of 653,000 (44% share). In the United States, viewership was split between the English-language channel ESPN2 and Spanish-language channel ESPN Deportes; viewership on ESPN2 averaged at 1.097 million, while ESPN Deportes received an average of 213,000 viewers, totalling 1.31 million. It was the first time a UEFA match on ESPN had been watched by more than 1 million viewers.\nAdvertising.\nBased on an expected audience of up to 13 million, ITV raised the prices of their 30-second advertising slots during the final from between £100,000 and £150,000 to as much as £250,000. It was estimated that ITV would stand to make £9 million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10 million if it went to extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3 million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4 million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved. Among the confirmed advertisers on ITV were Ford, Cadbury, Nike, Heineken, Audi and BlackBerry. Sky's advertising prices were not reported, but among their scheduled advertisers were Audi, Ford, Nike, Samsung and Pepsi.\nRewards.\nIn addition to the €5.4 million participation bonus, €5.7 million won from the group stage and €7.7 million from the three rounds prior to the final, Manchester United also received €7 million for winning the final. Chelsea also received €5.4 million for participation and €7.7 million for the first three knockout rounds, but received only €5.1 million from the group stage, having drawn two more games and won two fewer than Manchester United. Chelsea also received €4 million for finishing as runners-up.\nIn addition to the €23.4 million and €19.8 million earned respectively by the two clubs as prize money, Manchester United and Chelsea received money from the UEFA market pool share. The market pool share had a total value of €277 million, shared between the 32 clubs that qualified for the group stage. The pool was split in proportion to each national association's strength in the television market, with the Premier League clubs receiving around €60 million in total from the pool. The money was then split between the four teams who qualified for the Champions League from the 2006–07 FA Premier League based on their position in the league and the number of matches played in the 2007–08 Champions League. This meant that Manchester United, having won the 2006–07 Premier League, received around €19.5 million, and Chelsea, as runners-up, received around €16.5 million.\nAs winners of the Champions League, Manchester United earned places in the 2008 UEFA Super Cup and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. In the Super Cup, United faced 2008 UEFA Cup final winners Zenit Saint Petersburg at Stade Louis II in Monaco on 29 August 2008; Zenit won the match 2–1. As UEFA's representative at the Club World Cup, Manchester United entered the tournament at the semi-final stage, where they beat 2008 AFC Champions League winners Gamba Osaka 5–3. They then beat 2008 Copa Libertadores winners LDU Quito 1–0 in the final to become the first English club to win the competition."

        "text": "Edward Gerald Hinton (born June 26, 1947) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Hinton spent four seasons with the Baltimore Colts, including their 1970 Super Bowl winning season, and one season each with the Houston Oilers and New England Patriots. He played college football at the University of Oklahoma.\nEarly life.\nEddie Hinton was born on June 26, 1947 in Lawton, Oklahoma. Hinton began playing sports in fifth grade to escape his unpleasant home life. His parents were bootleggers and he claimed his family had a poor reputation in their neighborhood.\nHinton was a multi-sport athlete at Lawton High School. In his senior year, Hinton earned All-State honors as a halfback on the football team, started on the state-runner up basketball team, and won a state title in track in the low hurdles, earning him the Boomer Conference Athlete of the Year award. Hinton was also selected to represent Oklahoma in the 1965 Oil Bowl high school all-star game. He subsequently received a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma.\nCollege career.\nHinton played for three years at Oklahoma as a halfback and defensive back. Under offensive coordinator Barry Switzer, Hinton had a productive college career as both a pass catcher and rusher.\n1966 season.\nIn Hinton's sophomore year, Oklahoma started the season with four straight wins, reaching #10 in the AP poll. The team ultimately finished at 6-4, fifth in the Big Eight Conference. Hinton appeared in all 10 games with 26 receptions for 341 yards and two touchdowns and 270 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. Hinton also recorded a 93-yard punt return for a touchdown against Colorado.\n1967 season.\nIn his junior season, Hinton again appeared in all 10 games and led the team in receiving with 28 receptions for 427 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed for 250 yards and three touchdowns. Oklahoma went 10-1 and won the Big Eight Conference. The #3 ranked Sooners faced #2 Tennessee in the Orange Bowl, winning 26-24.\n1968 season.\nDespite suffering a broken hand, Hinton's senior year was his best statistical season at Oklahoma. Hinton led the Big Eight Conference in all major receiving categories with 60 receptions for 967 yards and six touchdowns. After his senior season, Hinton was named to the 1968 AP All-America Third team and was named as an Academic All-American.\nOklahoma went 7-4 on the season and were co-champions of the Big Eight Conference with Kansas. The Sooners earned a postseason bowl invite to play SMU in the Bluebonnet Bowl, which they lost 27-28. The team finished the 1968 season ranked #11 in the AP poll.\nProfessional career.\nHinton was drafted by the Baltimore Colts with the 25th overall pick in the first round of the 1969 NFL Draft.\nBaltimore Colts (1969-1972).\n1969 season.\nIn Hinton's rookie year, he saw limited playing time until the latter half of the season. His best game came in a snowy week 12 contest against the Detroit Lions where Hinton had five receptions for 134 yards and one touchdown. He finished the season with 13 receptions for 269 yards and one receiving touchdown and added another rushing touchdown. The Colts finished the season at 8-5, placing second in the Coastal Division standings and missing the playoffs.\n1970 season.\nIn 1970, Hinton became a starter at wide receiver and was a key contributor to the Colts' Super Bowl winning team. Hinton started 13 games and recorded his best statistical season in the NFL with 47 receptions for 733 yards and five touchdowns. He also added two rushing touchdowns. His best game of the season came in week two during the second-ever telecast of Monday Night Football against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Colts were routed 24-44, but Hinton served as the lone bright spot with 11 receptions for 190 yards and one touchdown.\nThe Colts recovered from the blowout loss and finished the regular season at 11-2-1. The Colts won the AFC East Division and earned a place in the 1970-71 playoffs. In Hinton's first playoff appearance against the Cincinnati Bengals he had three receptions for 86 yards and one touchdown. His longest catch was a 53-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Johnny Unitas in the fourth quarter to seal the Colts' 17-0 victory.\nThe following week, the Colts faced the Oakland Raiders in the inaugural 1970 AFC Championship Game. Hinton again performed well with five receptions for 115 yards. Although he did not score, Hinton was the Colts' leading receiver and had several long receptions to set up scoring plays. The Colts won 27-17 and earned a spot in the Super Bowl.\nIn Super Bowl V, the Colts faced the Dallas Cowboys at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. In what later became known as the \"Blunder Bowl\" due to the poor level of play, the Colts defeated the Cowboys 16-13 on a last second field goal by kicker Jim O'Brien. Hinton had two receptions for 51 yards in the game.\nHinton was also involved in two plays that contributed to the game's mocking nickname. In the second quarter, a Unitas pass intended for Hinton sailed high and bounced off his hands. The ball was then tipped by Cowboys defender Mel Renfro before falling into the arms of Colts tight end John Mackey who ran for a 75-yard touchdown. Hinton later caught a pass from wide receiver Sam Havrilak on a broken flea flicker play, but the ball was stripped by Renfro and Cornell Green on the Cowboys' 11-yard line. Several players attempted to control the ball before it eventually bounced through the back of the end zone for a Cowboys touchback.\n1971 season.\nIn his third professional season, Hinton and fellow receiver Ray Perkins maintained the Colts' dynamic passing attack. Hinton led the Colts in receiving yards with 25 receptions for 436 yards and two touchdowns. His two best regular season performances for the year came against the New England Patriots. In their week three matchup, Hinton had four receptions for 81 yards with the Colts winning 23-3. In week 14, Hinton scored both of the Colts' touchdowns, with a total of four receptions for 74 yards, in a 17-21 loss.\nThe Colts finished 10-4 and earned a wild card berth to the playoffs. In a Divisional round win against the Cleveland Browns, Hinton had two catches for 30 yards. In the against the Miami Dolphins, Hinton caught six passes for 98 yards, but the Colts lost the game 0-21.\n1972 season.\nThe 1972 season was a disappointment for both the Colts and Hinton. In the season's opening game, Hinton suffered a hamstring injury that lingered throughout the rest of the season. Hinton only appeared in eight games and totaled 11 receptions for 146 yards and one touchdown.\nHinton's lone touchdown was an important moment in an otherwise meaningless week 12 win against the Buffalo Bills. Quarterback Marty Domres, who had taken over earlier in the season for a benched Johnny Unitas, was injured and forced out of the game. Unitas entered the game and threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Hinton in the fourth quarter, Unitas' last touchdown pass as a Baltimore Colt.\nHinton later said about the play, \"I saw [the ball] coming and thought, 'Oh, my gosh, it's going to be intercepted.' I couldn't allow that to happen. I came back for the ball, reached over my shoulder and snatched it. Then I reversed field and just kept running. It was like I was walking on air and nobody could touch me. But I felt like I had to score that for [Unitas].\"\nThe Colts ended the season at 5-9 and did not make the playoffs. Under new ownership, the Colts began to make coaching and player personnel changes. Hinton was a casualty of the team's new direction, and was cut by the Colts prior to the start of the 1973 season.\nHouston Oilers (1973).\nHinton was claimed by the Houston Oilers at the beginning of the 1973 season. Houston struggled throughout the season, finishing with a 1-13 record. Hinton also struggled. Hobbled by lingering injuries, Hinton only recorded 13 catches for 202 yards and one touchdown. Hinton also returned kickoffs, with eight returns for 141 yards.\nTwo days prior to the conclusion of the 1974 NFL Strike in August 1974, Hinton reported to Oilers training camp. However, the Oilers cut Hinton in early September prior to the start of the regular season.\nNew England Patriots (1974).\nHinton was signed by the New England Patriots on October 17, 1974. Hinton had multiple connections that brought him to New England. Patriots' head coach Chuck Fairbanks was Hinton's head coach at Oklahoma, while Patriots' receivers coach was former Colts teammate Ray Perkins. Fairbanks hoped that Hinton could easily adjust to the Patriots' offense because of this familiarity. Hinton was brought in to strengthen the Patriots receiver group after Darryl Stingley suffered a spinal cord injury in a pre-season game, which ended Stingley's career and left him as a quadriplegic.\nHinton's role was limited during his season with the Patriots. He appeared in nine games, but only made one start, and recorded two receptions for 36 yards. The Patriots finished the season at 7-7. Hinton was placed on waivers by the Patriots in April 1975.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring from football, Hinton became a homebuilder. Hinton now lives on a farm in Spring Branch, Texas, with his wife and several animals. He previously served as a school bus driver for local school districts with the goal of helping troubled children."

        "text": "Newburgh On Ythan Golf Club was founded in 1888 by John Udny of Udny and a band of \"founding fathers\" and is one of the oldest golf courses in Scotland.\nIn 1897, Crown Prince Vajiravudh of Siam stayed for one month at the village hotel The Udny Arms, and spent his time learning to play golf on the links course. He was instructed by the professional of the day. The prince had completed his military training at Sandhurst and was studying History &amp; Law at Christ Church, Oxford at the time of his Scottish break. Vajiravudh went on to be King and ruled Siam (now Thailand) from 1910 until his death in 1925.\nThe course was originally presented to the people of the tiny fishing village of Newburgh for their enjoyment. The original 9 holes measured 1 mile, 401 yards (1 976 m) but it was changed around 1901 and was played as 18 holes up until the design was extended back to 18 holes in 1996 and now has a growing reputation as a ‘tough but fair’ traditional gorse lined links course where classic links shot making is required.\nThe club's clubhouse was built with the support of lottery and local authority funding and was officially opened by the former British Open Champion, Paul Lawrie in 2001.\nThe Golf Links is a Par 72, Competition Standard Scratch 72, measuring 6,423yards. The quality and standard of the course and greens is very high and it is acknowledged in Scottish golfing circles that the course offers a true test of links golf. Indeed, 2008 saw the course to hold the North East District Men's Amateur Open Championship, a Scottish Golf Union Order of Merit ranking event."

        "title": "Bill Kennedy (baseball, born 1921)",
        "text": "William Aulton Kennedy (March 14, 1921 – April 9, 1983), nicknamed \"Lefty\", was a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Redlegs of Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1948 and 1957.\nBiography.\nKennedy was born in Carnesville, Georgia. Signed before the 1939 season as an amateur free agent by the New York Yankees, Kennedy pitched three seasons in the low minors without much distinction before missing the 1943–45 seasons while serving in the U.S. Army during World War II.\nReturning to baseball in 1946, Kennedy put together one of the greatest pitching seasons in minor league history for the Rocky Mount Rocks in the Class-D Coastal Plain League. The 25-year-old went 28–3 with a 1.03 ERA over 41 games, striking out a staggering 456 batters in 280.0 innings—the second-highest single-season strikeout total in professional baseball history.\nFollowing the season he was sent to the Boston Red Sox and he spent 1947 with Boston's affiliate at Class-A Scranton. Though he struck out just 113 batters, he followed up his historic campaign with a 15-2 campaign record and a 2.62 ERA. After being left unprotected that winter, the Cleveland Indians selected him in the Rule 5 Draft, which led him breaking camp with the Cleveland Indians to open the 1948 season, making his MLB debut on April 26 at the age of 27. However, after just six ineffective outings he was traded to the St. Louis Browns for pitcher Sam Zoldak, missing out an opportunity to play in the World Series, which the Indians won.\nAfter pitching most of 1948 and all of 1949 in St. Louis, he spent nearly all of 1950 and part of 1951 in the minors. In March 1952, Kennedy was purchased by the Chicago White Sox, ending his four-year tenure with the Browns at a 12–24 record with a 4.84 ERA. Pitching on a winning team, he went on to record the best season of his career working almost exclusively in relief for the first time in his career. Kennedy notched a career-best 2.80 ERA over 70.2 innings, notching five saves and leading the American League in games pitched with 47.\nDespite his success in Chicago, that winter he was packaged with pitcher Marv Grissom in a trade to the Boston Red Sox for shortstop Vern Stephens. Alas, the trade failed to work out for either side; Stephens and Grissom were both dealt again by mid-season, and Kennedy was demoted to the minors, where he stayed for the remainder of the 1953 season and all of 1954 and '55.\nIn 1955 Kennedy moved to the Pacific Coast League, pitching for the Seattle Rainiers. Successful seasons in 1956 and '57 led to call-ups from the Cincinnati Reds, but he was ineffective, appearing in a combined nine MLB games over those two seasons and posting a 7.98 ERA. He made his last MLB appearance on September 29, 1957, at the age of 36.\nHe pitched three more seasons in the PCL before retiring following the 1960 season at the age of 39. In eight major league seasons, he had a 15–28 win–loss record, 172 games pitched (45 starts), 11 saves, 256 strikeouts and a 4.73 earned run average (ERA). He won an additional 149 games in 15 seasons in the minors.\nKennedy died in Seattle of lung cancer at the age of 62."

The Bears, as they are known, were founded in 1858 playing against Callen Park and other cricket clubs around Sydney at that time. UTS North Sydney currently plays in the NSW Premier Cricket. Having joined in 1893 as one of its founding members, the club is one of oldest elite cricket clubs in Sydney.\nThe club's home ground is the famous North Sydney Oval where it has remained since its inception. In the 1980s, North Sydney Council purchased some old grandstands from the Sydney Cricket Ground during its re-development, and relocated them to North Sydney Oval. In the 1980s, the club and community recognised the potential of the Miller St location and worked with the then North Sydney Mayor and current club Patron Ted Mack to develop the ground, enhancing its historic character.\nThe Bears have won 5 first grade premierships, 11 second grade cups, 9 third grade titles, 2 fifth grade titles and 2 Poidevin Gray (U21s) and 1 AW Green Shield (U16s) titles.

He served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette from 2004 to 2010.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in New Roads, Louisiana, Lee graduated from Catholic High School of Pointe Coupee in New Roads. At Nicholls State University, Lee played under Gordon Stauffer on the Nicholls State Colonels men's basketball team from 1986 to 1990 before becoming a student assistant in the 1990–91 season. As a senior, Lee started all 27 games played and averaged 12.8 points and 2.3 rebounds. Lee completed his bachelor's degree in general studies in May 1991.\nCoaching career.\nOpelousas High School (1991–1996).\nFrom 1992 to 1996, Lee was head coach at Opelousas High School in Opelousas, Louisiana. In five seasons, Lee had a cumulative 109–29 record.\nLouisiana–Lafayette assistant and head coach (1996–2010).\nFrom 1996 to 2004, Lee was an assistant coach at Louisiana–Lafayette under Marty Fletcher and Jessie Evans. During those years, Louisiana–Lafayette won the Sun Belt tournament in 2000 with an automatic qualification to the NCAA tournament, along with two NIT appearances and two Sun Belt West Division championships in 2002 and 2003.\nOn August 17, 2004, Lee was promoted to head coach. This followed the firing of Glynn Cyprien over resume issues.\nIn six seasons as head coach, Lee had a cumulative 80–100 record. Although Louisiana–Lafayette finished 2004–05 with a 20–11 record, Sun Belt Tournament title, and NCAA Tournament appearance, the NCAA vacated 17 wins, the conference title, and postseason appearance from that season due to the academic ineligibility of Orien Greene. Due to resulting NCAA sanctions combined with a low Academic Progress Rate score after his second season, Lee could offer only a reduced number of scholarships beginning in 2007–08. Despite these sanctions and having one of the youngest rosters in the Sun Belt, the team won the Sun Belt West Division co-championship in 2008 with a 15–15 (11–7 Sun Belt) record, which would be the best single-season winning percentage in Lee's tenure.\nIn his final season, Louisiana–Lafayette finished 13–17 (10–8 Sun Belt). On March 9, 2010, following a loss to Louisiana–Monroe in the first round of the Sun Belt Tournament, Louisiana–Lafayette announced that Lee's contract would not be renewed.\nReturn to assistant coaching (2010–2014).\nAfter leaving Louisiana–Lafayette, Lee was an assistant at in-state Sun Belt rival Louisiana–Monroe under Keith Richard in the 2010–11 season. Again in the Sun Belt, Lee was an assistant at Arkansas–Little Rock under Steve Shields from 2011 to 2014.\nMorgan City High School (2015–2016).\nAfter a year away from basketball, in the summer of 2015, Lee became head coach at Morgan City High School in Morgan City, Louisiana. He left after one season with a 12–18 record."

Johnson also excelled on special teams as a punt return specialist. Many of his punt return marks still stand in the UT record books. In his freshman year, Johnson got off to a great start being named a starter in his first game, but a leg injury kept him on the sidelines for much of the year. The next year, he regained his starting status on a team that went through the regular season undefeated. That year his fourth-down tackle inside the Texas five-yard line preserved a win over Oklahoma. He won the first of three All-Southwest Conference honors that year.

The European team won the competition by a margin of 14 to 13 and retained the Ryder Cup.\nThe Europeans held a 10–5 lead heading into the final day, but the Americans mounted a comeback by winning the singles matches 8–4 but fell just short. Colin Montgomerie halved the final match with Scott Hoch (conceding a par putt on the final hole) to seal the outright victory for the Europeans.\nThis was the first of six consecutive victories at home by Europe, a streak that remains intact through 2023.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format used in 1997 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeams.\nThe selection process for the European team remained largely unchanged from that used in 1995 with two captain's picks. If captain Ballesteros qualified automatically, he had the choice of standing down and selecting a third player. The qualifying period remained the same, starting with the Canon European Masters in Switzerland at the beginning of September 1996 and ending with the BMW International Open on 31 August, the remaining two team members being chosen soon afterwards by the team captain. Prior to the final event Miguel Ángel Martín was in 10th place in the points list. He had, however, not played since The Open Championship because of a wrist injury. In the final event both José María Olazábal and Pádraig Harrington had chances to overtake Martin but neither succeeded. Olazábal finished 11th in the final points list with Harrington 12th. Because of uncertainty about Martin's fitness, the announcement of the two captain's picks, which was to have been immediately after the BMW International Open, was cancelled. On the Tuesday Martin was given an ultimatum that he was required to play 18 holes the following day to demonstrate that he would be fit to play in the Ryder Cup. Martin refused and was replaced by Olazábal, who had finished in the next qualifying place. Ballesteros announced his wildcards on the Thursday, choosing Nick Faldo and Jesper Parnevik.

        "text": "The 31st Ryder Cup Matches were held September 22–24, 1995 at the East Course of Oak Hill Country Club in Pittsford, New York, a suburb southeast of Rochester.\nThe European team won the competition by a margin of 14 to 13 points to win back the Cup. At the time, this was only Europe's second victory on U.S. soil, the first was eight years earlier in 1987. This was the third consecutive Ryder Cup where Bernard Gallacher captained the European side and the only victory.\nGoing into the Sunday singles matches, Europe trailed by 2 points, 7 to 9. For the first time, they overcame a deficit entering the singles to win the Cup. The unheralded Irish rookie Philip Walton secured victory for Europe by defeating Jay Haas by one hole. The next Ryder Cup where Europe won from behind was 2012, also held in the U.S.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format used in 1995 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup.

For the first time prize money in the three Major Championships played in the USA was included. This change was meant to provide more opportunities for the leading players to gain automatic qualification. The number of captain's picks was, however, reduced from three to two. The qualifying period remained the same, starting with the Canon European Masters in Switzerland at the beginning of September 1994 and ending with the Volvo German Open on August 27, the remaining two team members being chosen soon afterwards by the team captain. In the final event Ian Woosnam had a chance to overtake Philip Walton but a poor last round left him out of the automatic qualifying places. Gallacher announced his picks on August 28. He had already indicated that he would choose Nick Faldo as one of his choices. José María Olazábal was chosen as the second selection. Olazábal had finished in the top 10 in two recent PGA Tour events but had been troubled with a foot injury during the season. Olazábal continued to be troubled with his foot injury and withdrew from the team on September 11. Gallacher immediately chose Ian Woosnam as his replacement.\nOlazábal had finished 12th in the points list and had a world ranking of 10 at the time of the Ryder Cup.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow.

        "text": "The 30th Ryder Cup Matches were held in England at The Belfry in Wishaw, Warwickshire, near Sutton Coldfield. The United States team won a second consecutive Ryder Cup, by a margin of 15 to 13 points. Europe took a slender one point lead into the Sunday singles matches in what was a close contest. Davis Love III secured victory for the U.S. by defeating Costantino Rocca at the last hole, 1 up. Through 2023, this is the most recent U.S. victory in Europe and also the last time the U.S. retained the Cup.\nThis was the first Ryder Cup played in Europe to be televised live in the United States by a major network, NBC. The 1989 edition was carried by the USA Network on cable, with video provided by the BBC.\nThe U.S. television coverage in 1985 was a highlight show on ESPN in early November, over a month after its completion. NBC took over live weekend coverage in 1991 in South Carolina.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format predominantly used from 1987 to 1999 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes - matches that were level after 18 holes were deemed a draw with half a point going to each team.\nTeams.\nThe selection process for the European team remained similar to that used since 1985, with nine players chosen from a money list at the conclusion of the Volvo German Open on 29 August and the remaining three team members being chosen soon afterwards by the team captain. The beginning of the qualifying period was, however, extended to start with the Canon European Masters in Switzerland at the beginning of September 1992 rather than starting in January 1993. The change was made so that there would be more opportunities for the leading players to qualify by right. In 1991 two of the three captain's picks were given to José María Olazábal and Nick Faldo, then ranked two and three in the world, who had played most of their golf in the US and did not qualify automatically. A few European players declined invitations to the 1993 PGA Championship to play in the Hohe Brücke Austrian Open in order to gain Ryder Cup points. At this time prize money in the major championships played in the USA did not earn Ryder Cup points. Prior to the final event Sam Torrance had to withdraw from the final event because of injury but none of the other challengers for automatic places were able to pass him. Joakim Haeggman tied for 6th place in the German Open and rose from 14th to 10th place in the points list while Ronan Rafferty tied for 20th place and finished 11th. Gallacher made his picks on 30 August. It was widely expected that he would choose Seve Ballesteros and José María Olazábal as two of his selections and most interest centred on whether he would select Haeggman or Rafferty.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow.

        "text": "The 29th Ryder Cup Matches were held September 27–29, 1991, on The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island Golf Resort in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, southwest of Charleston.\nThe United States team won the competition by 14 to 13 points, winning back the Cup on the 18th hole of the final match. Bernhard Langer missed a six-foot (1.8 m) par putt which would have won his match and clinched a 14-all tie and retained the Ryder Cup for Europe. It was the first win for the U.S. since 1983, after consecutive losses to Europe in 1985 and 1987 and a tie in 1989. Due to the fierce competition, gamesmanship and general over-exuberance of the U.S. Team and their fans, these Ryder Cup Matches became known as the \"War on the Shore.\"\nThe Ocean Course later hosted the PGA Championship in 2012 and 2021.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format in 1991 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeams.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow. The world rankings and records are at the start of the 1991 Ryder Cup.\nThe selection process for the European team remained the same as used since 1985, with nine players chosen from the 1991 European Tour money list at the conclusion of the German Open on August 25 and the remaining three team members being chosen immediately afterwards by the team captain, Bernard Gallacher. Gallacher had announced before the final event that he would choose Nick Faldo as one of his picks. He also announced that he would select José María Olazábal, who was then in the 9th and final automatic spot, even if he dropped out of the top nine. At the time Olazábal and Faldo were second and third in the world rankings. Olazábal had just won The International on the PGA Tour. Eamonn Darcy, in 7th place in the points list, chose to miss the German Open. However, with David Gilford earning £4,320 in prize money, Sam Torrance tying for 3rd place and Paul Broadhurst losing a playoff, Darcy dropped to 10th place in the final list, £58.26 behind Gilford. Olazábal dropped to 11th place in the points list but had been assured of selection anyway. Gallacher chose Mark James as his third choice in preference to Darcy.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow.

Much was discussed by the U.S. captain to either replace him at the last minute or carry on as planned. The decision was taken to allow Pate to participate in the games causing him to sit out the first three sessions of play. The only session he played in was a four-ball on Saturday afternoon, losing to Bernhard Langer and Colin Montgomerie. Prior to the first singles tee off on Sunday the U.S. team announced that Steve Pate was unable to play in the singles due to his earlier sustained injury. As a result, the match he was due to contend with David Gilford was automatically halved causing Gilford to miss out his singles match.\nThis brought heavy criticism from the general media and the European team feeling a sense of bad sportsmanship on behalf of the Americans. Especially considering U.S. captain Dave Stockton had chosen to play Pate in an earlier match thus risking causing further unnecessary injury to the player. In post-match interviews serious questions were asked of the American's reasoning and tactics behind claiming half a point for one of their weaker players.\nBallesteros/Azinger and Floyd controversies.\nBallesteros and Azinger had previously locked horns in 1989 when Ballesteros tried to have a scuffed ball taken out of play which Azinger disagreed with.\nThe bad blood escalated at Kiawah Island when on the morning of the Friday foursomes with Ballesteros partnering José María Olazábal against Paul Azinger and Chip Beck the Europeans noticed the Americans had changed the compression of the ball on the 7th tee which is in violation of the one-ball rule. Ballesteros accused his opponents of doing this at least three times since the start of the match. On speaking with the referee at first Azinger flatly denied it. However once it had become apparent to the Americans that they were not called up on the violation at the time of incident therefore could no longer be penalized by loss of hole they admitted to switching their ball.\nThis incident was the stem of accusations of the U.S. side of repeated gamesmanship, bad sportsmanship and ill tactics in many future matches to come.\nOn the morning of the Saturday foursomes with Ballesteros partnering José María Olazábal against Raymond Floyd and Fred Couples, Ballesteros developed a small cough. After noise was coincidentally made during swings made by the United States Team on the first 2 holes, Floyd approached Ballesteros with a severe warning that he was \"better than you (Ballesteros) could ever be at this\" and that if Ballesteros did not stop he would reciprocate with force. \nSince the mid-1980s, the European team had dominated the event including wins in 1985, 1987 and retaining the cup in 1989. With exception to 1993, the European team continued to dominate until ill feelings between the two sides came to a head in an explosive match at Brookline in 1999 where the U.S. side and their fans were again accused of having the mindset of \"anything to win\" going against the spirit of how the matches were intended to be played."

        "title": "William Fuller (American football)",
        "text": "William Henry Fuller Jr. (born March 8, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for 13 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Fuller played college football for the North Carolina Tar Heels and professionally for the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars of the United States Football League (USFL), and the Houston Oilers, Philadelphia Eagles, and San Diego Chargers of the NFL. Fuller was one of the better pass rushers in the NFL during his time in the league and finished his career with 100.5 sacks. He was named to the Pro Bowl four times and selected as an All-American twice while in college. In 2004, Fuller was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. During his career and after his retirement, Fuller has also done considerable work in raising funds for diabetes research.\nEarly years.\nFuller was born in Norfolk, Virginia. He grew up in Chesapeake, Virginia, and attended Indian River High School, where he lettered in track, basketball, and football. Fuller graduated from Indian River in 1980.\nCollege career.\nFuller attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he played defensive line for the North Carolina Tar Heels football team. He recorded nine sacks and 22 tackles for loss as a sophomore. \nAs a senior, he had 81 tackles, a team-leading five sacks, and 22 tackles for loss. For his efforts that season he was awarded All-American and first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) honors as well as UNC's defensive Most Valuable Player award. Fuller was also a finalist for the Lombardi and Outland Trophies, special awards designated only for linemen. \nWhile at UNC, Fuller helped lead the Tar Heels to three bowl games, made the All-ACC team three times, and the All-America team twice (1982 and 1983). He graduated in 1986 with a degree in psychology. Fuller was later inducted into UNC's sports hall of fame, and selected as a member of the ACC's 50th Anniversary Football Team in 2002.\nProfessional career.\nFuller was selected by the Philadelphia Stars in the 1984 USFL Territorial Draft. He was also selected with the 21st selection in the first round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players by the Los Angeles Rams. Fuller decided to play in the USFL with the Stars, where he played for two seasons, winning two USFL championships and playing with future NFL players such as Bart Oates and Sam Mills. \nFuller joined the NFL after the USFL folded in 1986 and his rights were subsequently traded by the Rams to the Houston Oilers where he started his career in the NFL. After recording a total of 3 sacks in his first two seasons, Fuller emerged in 1988 and tied for the team lead in sacks with 8.5. He was described as the most improved defensive player on the team by head coach Jerry Glanville. \nAfter recording 14.5 sacks over 1989 and 1990, Fuller finished tied for second in the NFL with 15 sacks in 1991, and was named to his first Pro Bowl. He followed that up by recording eight and ten sacks, respectively in 1992 and 1993. After the 1993 season Fuller signed a three-year $8 Million contract as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles, in part out of a desire to be closer to his off–season home in Virginia. \nHe subsequently played three stellar seasons in 1994, 1995, and 1996. He recorded 9.5 sacks in his first season there (1994) and set a team record for most consecutive games with a sack at seven. Fuller had 13 sacks in each of the following two seasons (1995 and 1996), and was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his three seasons with the Eagles. After the 1996 season Fuller signed a two-year $5.6 million contract with the San Diego Chargers, while there his production steeply declined. \nAfter two seasons, in which he recorded three sacks each, Fuller retired following the 1998 season. By the time his NFL career ended Fuller had recorded 100.5 sacks becoming one of the few players in NFL history to record more than 100 sacks.\nPersonal life.\nFuller has four daughters by his wife Precilla, Karen, Krystal, Kimberly, and Kalisa. Shortly before the 1995 season Fuller's father, who was blind at the time due to type 1 diabetes, died. Fuller and his father were very close and had filmed a United Way and the NFL commercial together during the offseason. The commercial, which featured an organization for the blind, was not aired until two days after his father's death. \nFuller is also a noted philanthropist, who was actively involved in programs relating to Juvenile diabetes, Special Olympics, Ronald McDonald House and the Boys' Clubs of America during his time in the NFL. He hosts the William Fuller Tournament in Houston for JDRF (formerly Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). The event has raised over $1 million for research to cure diabetes, and Fuller himself has helped raise over $3 million for diabetes research. \nFuller currently owns and operates his own real estate development company, Fulco Development, which is based in Norfolk. His company is currently working on development projects in the Hampton Roads region. He has also donated his time as an assistant football coach for Frank W. Cox High School in Virginia Beach. In 2011, Fuller became a radio commentator for the Virginia Destroyers UFL team."

        "text": "The Fairfield Stags men's basketball team represents Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut and competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I. The Stags play their home games in the 3,500 seat Leo D. Mahoney Arena on campus. The team is currently coached by Chris Casey, his first year at the helm.\nThe Stags have experienced post-season tournament action fourteen times having competed in the NAIA Tournament in 1951; the NCAA DII Tournament in 1960, 1961 and 1962; the National Invitational Tournament in 1973, 1974, 1978, 1996, 2003; and 2011 NIT; and the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 1986, 1987 and 1997. In the 1973 National Invitation Tournament, the Stags advanced to the second round where the team lost by one point to eventual champion Virginia Tech. And in the 1997 NCAA tournament, the Stags nearly achieved a historical upset of top-seeded North Carolina after leading the Tar Heels by seven points at halftime. The team also won the MAAC Regular Season Title in 1986 and the MAAC Championship Tournament in 1986, 1987 and 1997.\nIndividually, Joe DeSantis earned All-American honors in 1979; Darren Phillip was the nation's top rebounder averaging 14 rebounds per game in 2000; and Deng Gai was the nation's top shot blocker in 2005 averaging 5.5 blocks per game which ranks #5 on the NCAA's all-time blocked shot average list. Thirteen Stags have been either drafted or signed to play in the National Basketball Association.\nHistory.\nDawn of the Stags.\nThrough the efforts of Rev. Victor Leeber, S.J., Fairfield University introduced men's basketball in 1948 and has played continuously since then. Fairfield played its first-ever game against Brooklyn College in Brooklyn, New York, losing 78–46, and won its first-ever game that season against Hillyer College (now the University of Hartford), 47–37, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, at the Bridgeport Armory, Fairfield's original home court. During the 1950–51 season, under new Head Coach James Hanrahan, the program experienced its first winning season with a 16–11 record and received the school's first postseason berth in the 1951 NAIA National Men's Basketball Championship Tournament.\nRed Stags rising.\nDuring the 1958–59 season Head Coach George Bisacca took over the program and proceeded to elevate the Stags to a higher level of success, experiencing only one losing season in 10 years. The Stags received three straight postseason berths to the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship Tournament between 1960 and 1962 and advanced to the second round in 1960 and 1961. On the heels of this postseason success, Fairfield upgraded the program to NCAA Division I beginning with the 1964–65 season. The 1965–66 team went 19–5 and became the first Fairfield team to be ranked in one of the national polls.\nThe Golden Barakat era.\nThe most successful stretch of Fairfield basketball occurred under Head Coach Fred Barakat when the Stags received three berths in the post-season NIT in six years which was chronicled in the book, 25 Years Plus One: Recounting the Meteoric Rise of Fairfield Basketball, by Connecticut sportswriter, Don Harrison. During the 1972–73 season the Stags finished with an 18–9 overall record and were invited to the post-season NIT for the first time in the programs history. In the 1st round, Captain George Groom led the Stags to an 80–76 victory over Marshall University playing before 13,904 fans at Madison Square Garden. In the 2nd round, the Stags fell 76–77 to the eventual National Champion Virginia Tech Gobblers before more than 17,000 fans. The Stags followed up this success with a 17–9 overall record and a second invitation to the post-season NIT during the 1973–74 season. In the 1st round, Captain Richie O'Connor led the Stags to a 37–32 halftime lead before falling 65–66 to the University of Hawaii before 17,739 fans. The Stags returned to the post-season NIT for the third time during the 1977–78 season following the program's first 20 win season (22–5 overall) and a record point setting 123–108 victory over the then 14th ranked Holy Cross Crusaders. In the 1st round of the tournament, Junior Mark Young led the Stags with a 32 performance in a 93–108 losing effort to the Dayton Flyers.\nBack to backs in the MAAC.\nFairfield earned its first berth in NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship in 1986 after sweeping through the St. Peter's Peacocks, Iona Gaels and Holy Cross Crusaders en route to winning the MAAC Championship. The Stags faced the Illinois Fighting Illini in the first round of Southeast Regional of the 1986 NCAA Tournament. The Stags featured five 1,000 point career scorers on this team including Tony George (program's all-time leading scorer with 2006 points), Troy Bradford (1648 points), Jeff Gromos (1429 points), A. J. Wynder (1313 points, drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1987), and Pat Yerina (1255 points). The Stags were coached by first year head coach Mitch Buonoguoro and ended the year with a 24–7 record, the most wins in school history.\nThe following season, Fairfield overcame an injury-plagued season to mount an improbable run to its second consecutive MAAC Championship and to earn its second consecutive bid to the 1987 NCAA Tournament. The Stags defeated the LaSalle Explorers, Army Black Knights and needed the heroics of a last second shot by A. J. Wynder to help propel the Stags past the Iona Gaels in overtime and to the MAAC Championship. The Stags faced the top-seeded and eventual national champion Indiana Hoosiers in the first round of the Midwest Regional before 29,610 fans in the Hoosier Dome. Jeff Gromos led all Fairfield scorers with 21 points, followed by A. J. Wynder with 15 points.\nDuring the 1995–96 season Head Coach Paul Cormier led the Stags to a 20–10 overall record, an appearance in the MAAC championship game and the program's fourth berth in the NIT. In the opening round of the NIT, the Stags played the Providence College Friars before 6,368 fans at the New Haven Coliseum. Led by Shannon Bowman the Stags held a 46–43 half time lead before eventually falling 78–69 to the Friars.\nPicked to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference in 1996–97, Fairfield suffered through an injury-plagued regular season and finished in last place. But the Stags made a Cinderella run in the MAAC tournament, defeating top seed Iona, St. Peter's and Canisius to capture the league's automatic berth in the 1997 NCAA Tournament despite an 11–18 record. Fairfield then gave top seeded North Carolina all it could handle in the first round of the East Region in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Stags opened a 37–28 lead early in the second half before their bid to become the first 16 seed to win an NCAA tournament game fell 82–74. Stag legend Greg Francis '97 almost single-handedly upset the Tar Heels scoring 26 points including eight three-pointers. Following the game, legendary North Carolina coach Dean Smith said \"I had to find Francis after the game but I couldn't shake his hand because it was so hot.\"\nO'Toole time.\nIn 2002, Stags basketball moved from the on-campus Alumni Hall to the new 9,500 seat Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Connecticut. During that same season, Head Coach Tim O'Toole '87 led the Stags to a 19–12 overall record, an appearance to the MAAC tournament championship game, and the program's fifth berth in the NIT. In the opening round of the NIT, Nick Delfico led the Stags with 14 points in a 90–78 losing effort to the Boston College Eagles before 6,500 fans at the arena. During 2004–05 season, Deng Gai '05 led the nation in shots blocked with 5.5 blocks per game and graduated as number eight on the NCAA's all-time blocked shots list.\nCooley and the Gang.\nOn April 11, 2006, Ed Cooley (former Boston College Eagles assistant coach) became the program's eleventh Head Coach ushering in a new era of Stags basketball. During the first round of the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) the Stags overcame a 27-point deficit with 16:08 left to play to defeat George Mason in overtime, 101–96. The 27-point comeback is the biggest in Division I postseason history. The Stags were led by senior Mike Evanovich who finished with a career-high 32 points and a school record nine three-pointers including one with 0.9 seconds in regulation to send the game into overtime. Fellow senior Anthony Johnson led the Stags in overtime scoring 9 points and finished with 25 points in the game. And at the conclusion of the 2010 season, Coach Cooley received the inaugural 2010 Ben Jobe National Coach of the Year Award, presented annually to the top minority men's basketball coach in the nation, in recognition of his coaching the Stags through numerous injuries to a near school record 23-win season and Derek Needham was named a Freshman All-American. During the 2010–11 season, Fairfield won the MAAC regular season title and earned a berth in the 2011 NIT where the Stags beat the Colorado State Rams, 62–60, in the first round. Additionally, Coach Ed Cooley and sophomore Derek Needham earned recognition from the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) with Cooley named the District I Coach of the Year and Needham selected to the District I-New England team.\nJohnson era.\nIn April 2011, Johnson accepted a head coaching position at Fairfield University, replacing Ed Cooley. He coached the 2011–12 Stags to the semifinals of the 2012 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament where they lost to Mercer, after defeating Yale, Manhattan and Robert Morris to finish with a 22–15 record. Mercer went on to win the tournament. For the second season in a row, he was a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award. The 2012–13 team started the season 10–10 (2–6) before winning five consecutive and seven out of eight Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference games. The team then lost its two final conference games to finish 9–9 in conference. Eventually the team finished 19–15 (9–9).\nJay Young experiment.\nOn April 3, 2019 Young was named the 13th head coach in Fairfield history.

        "title": "Beanpot Cycling Classic",
        "text": "The Beanpot Cycling Classic is a collegiate cycling race weekend, held near Boston each spring. For many years it was the largest regular season collegiate race weekend in North America, hosting over 400 competitors each year.\nRaces.\nThe Beanpot consists of three races: a team time trial and a road race, both hosted in Grafton and Westborough, Massachusetts, and a criterium, held in Somerville, Massachusetts.\nThe race weekend is a regular season road race weekend in the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference, and winners garner points that advance them and their schools in divisional standings. Schools are awarded triple points, due to having three races in the event. Winning schools receive a clay beanpot as a trophy.\nTeam Time Trial\nThe team time trial is held on a seven-mile course. In 2005 and 2006 the time trial descended from Grafton center and traveled along mostly flat farmland before returning for a tough climb back into the town center.\nRoad Race\nThe road race is held on a 13-mile rolling course, starting and finishing at the campus of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, the veterinary school at Tufts University.\nBreaks often form on the deceptive Brigham Hill, a 3/4 mile climb with a false crest halfway up.\nOptimal viewing locations are along Brigham Hill, along the hill on East St. in North Grafton, and at the start/finish at the Tufts Veterinary School.\nCriterium\nThe criterium is held on a fast, technical course along Professor’s Row at the main campus of Tufts University. The fast, sharp turns and repeated climbs cause the race to break early. The second turn is especially demanding, positioned at the foot of a steep descent. Racers must be especially careful here to avert disaster.\nFirsts.\nIn 2004 the Beanpot was the first collegiate race other than the collegiate national championships to have over 300 participants. Then in 2005 the Beanpot was the first collegiate race with over 400 racers. In 2006 that number swelled to 470 racers before breaking the 500-racer barrier and its own previous record for largest collegiate race in history with the 2007 edition. Over 60 different college/universities were represented with schools from 11 different states and two countries competing.\nIn 2005, the Beanpot was the first collegiate race to introduce fields split by division which is now required throughout the conference once fields reach a certain size limit. The Beanpot incorporated this innovation initially in order to accommodate the growing numbers of racers in each race.\nThe 2006 edition was the first collegiate race to offer a coached \"introduction to racing\" category which is now standard at all conference races. In this category, the first half of the race is neutral while coaches and experienced cyclists ride along the competitors coaching them and offering racing tips then halfway through the race the coaches leave and it becomes a normal race to the finish.\nHistory was also in made 2006 when - to accommodate the increased number of women's competitors - Beanpot organizers instituted a women's C category for the first time in collegiate cycling history.\nOrganization.\nThe Beanpot is organized by a consortium of Boston-area college cycling clubs. Historically, the time trial is organized by Boston University, the road race by Harvard University, and the criterium by Tufts University. MIT, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute of Technology, and Boston College coordinate finances, promotion, fund-raising, and administration for the event.\nSince the 2005 edition two raffles are typically held to raise funds. One raffle has cycling-specific prizes such as components or wheels. The other raffle has general-interest prizes such as gift certificates to local restaurants. The raffles were added to help offset the expense of hosting a race of this magnitude.\nNotable Past Participants.\nA number of current professional level athletes as well as other cycling dignitaries have attended the Beanpot over the years.\nThe then USA Cycling CEO Gerard Bisceglia attended the 2005 edition. Former professional racer and current pro team manager Jonathan Vaughters was a guest speaker at the pasta dinner at the 2004 Beanpot. Mark Abramson, former president of the USA Cycling Board of Trustees, was a long time Beanpot attendee as he was the long-time conference director for the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conferencen (ECCC). He was conference director during the Beanpot's significant years of 2004-2007. Prior to that he was a member of the Tufts team and organized &amp; raced in the Tufts crit existing prior to the modern iteration of the Beanpot.\nNotable professional riders who have raced the Beanpot include multi-time Olympian &amp; 23+ time national champion Bobby Lea as well as his Penn State teammate Mike Friedman. Ted King also competed in the Beanpot while attending Middlebury College. Adam Carr is a domestic professional cyclist that has competed in the Beanpot."

        "text": "Chris Johns (born 14 March 1964) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. He played in the centres, achieving representative honors for Australia and New South Wales. His club football career was spent with the St. George Dragons and Brisbane Broncos, as well as two spells in England, first with Castleford (Heritage No. 653) in 1986-87 and then Barrow in 1989–90. After retiring from the playing field, Johns worked in the administration of the Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm clubs.\nPlaying career.\nAlthough born in Queensland, Johns was raised in the St George District of Sydney. Johns played his junior rugby league for Penshurst RSL.\nJohns made his first grade début for St. George during the 1984 NSWRL season and the following year played as a reserve back for St. George in their 6–7 loss to Canterbury in the Grand Final after earlier playing in the Dragons winning reserve grade grand final side.\nJohns played left-, i.e. number 4, in the 31–24 victory over Hull F.C. in Castleford's 1986 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1986–87 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds, on Saturday 11 October 1986. Johns then moved to the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership's newly created Brisbane Broncos in 1988.\nIn 1989 Chris Johns (despite being born in Queensland) became the first Queensland based player to play State of Origin for New South Wales when he made his début for the Blues on the wing for Game 1 of the 1989 State of Origin series at Lang Park, the home of the Broncos. Johns was the top try-scorer of the 1989 Brisbane Broncos season\nJohns went on to play 10 games for NSW between 1989 and 1994, scoring 3 tries. Although a centre at club level, Johns pace saw him play mainly on the wing or from the bench in representative sides with Australia blessed with top class centres in Mal Meninga, Laurie Daley, Dale Shearer, Andrew Ettingshausen and Brad Fittler.\nAt the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, and despite not playing for NSW in the 1990 State of Origin series, Johns was selected for the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France where he played in 11 tour games and scored 4 tries on tour. Chris Johns made his test début for Australia as a reserve back in the final game of the tour against France at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in Perpignan.\nDuring 1991 Johns played in NSW 1–2 series loss to Queensland in the 1991 Origin series and was then chosen for all three mis-season Trans-Tasman Tests against New Zealand, making his run on début for Australia in the 1st Test loss to the Kiwis at Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne. Following the end of the 1991 season, Johns was part of the Australian touring side to Papua New Guinea, playing in both tests against the Kumuls.\nJohns continued good form saw him play on the wing during Game 3 of NSW's 2-1 1992 State of Origin series win over Qld. That year saw the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand with Johns selected as a reserve for the 2nd Test against the Lions at Melbourne's Princes Park where he scored his 1st test try in Australia's shock 10–33 loss. After being overlooked for the opening test, Johns was called into the side to replace Brad Fittler who was given leave from the team following the death of his Penrith teammate Ben Alexander. Johns retained his spot for the 3rd test in Brisbane and helped Australia retain The Ashes which they have held since 1973. Following this Johns was selected for what would be his last test for Australia as a reserve back, scoring his 2nd test try in the 36–14 win over Papua New Guinea in Townsville.\nIn the weeks following the Broncos maiden Grand Final over St. George in 1992, Johns travelled with the Broncos to England, where he played at centre in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan at Wigan's famous Central Park, helping Brisbane become the first Australian club to win the match in Britain. A week earlier he was a non-playing reserve in Australia's 10–6 win over Great Britain in the World Cup final at Wembley Stadium, London in front of a World Record rugby league test crowd of 73,631 fans (Johns was the only Australian selected in the 17 not to get any game time in the final).\nChris Johns was overlooked for both Origin and Test selection in 1993 but went on to play 24 games and score 9 tries in the 1993 NSWRL season for the Broncos, helping them to a second straight Grand Final win over St. George.\nJohns continued to play well for the Broncos in 1994, form which saw him selected for games 2 and 3 for NSW in their 2-1 Origin series win over Qld. Mid-way through the season he was also part of Brisbane's 14–20 loss to Wigan in the 1994 World Club Challenge at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium in front of a still WCC record crowd of 54,220.\nJohns had an injury interrupted season for the Broncos in 1995, playing just nine games and scoring 2 tries. His final season before announcing his retirement was the 1996 ARL season, where he played 21 games but surprisingly failed to score a try.\nFrom his début with St. George in 1984 until his retirement following 1996, Chris Johns played in 223 games (52 for St. George, 171 for Brisbane) and scored 57 tries (7 and 50), winning two premierships and one World Club Challenge for the Broncos. He represented NSW on 10 occasions, scoring 3 tries and played in 9 tests for Australia, scoring 2 tries. He also played for Castleford and Barrow in England and represented NSW City Origin on 4 occasions between 1989 and 1994.\nPost-playing.\nFollowing retirement Johns worked in the Brisbane Broncos administration before moving south with John Ribot to help set up the new Melbourne Storm club. He was responsible for signing the key players that allowed Melbourne to win the premiership in only their second season. He left the post at the end of 2002.\nIn 2000 Johns was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league.\nIn 2005 Johns became the 6th former player inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame.\nDuring the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Johns."

        "text": "The SEC women's basketball tournament (sometimes known simply as the SEC Tournament) is the conference tournament in women's basketball for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). It is a single-elimination tournament that involves all league schools (currently 14 after the addition of two schools in 2012), and seeded based on regular season records.\nThe tournament was first held in 1980, and originally determined the conference champion. Even after the SEC began a uniform conference schedule in the 1982–83 season, the tournament continued to determine the official conference champion through the 1985 edition. Starting in the 1985–86 season, the SEC began awarding its official conference championship solely to the team(s) with the best regular-season record. This change brought SEC women's basketball in line with men's basketball, in which the SEC has awarded its official conference title based on regular-season record since the 1950–51 season.\nUnder the current format, the bottom four teams in the conference play first-round games, while the top four teams receive a \"double-bye\" and do not play until the quarterfinals."

        "title": "1971 NCAA lacrosse tournament",
        "text": "The 1971 NCAA lacrosse tournament was the first annual tournament hosted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the team champion of college lacrosse among its members in the United States.\nPrior to this the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) had voted for the national champion and, subsequently, awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy for the college lacrosse title based on regular season records.\nIn the inaugural final, top-seeded Cornell defeated Maryland, 12–6. The championship game was played at Hofstra Stadium at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York with 5,458 fans in attendance.\nThis was Cornell's first lacrosse title since winning the USILA championship in 1907. Cornell was 1–4–1 against Maryland up to this point, in a series that began with Cornell's 2–1 win in 1921. The teams played a 2–2 tie in 1922, and Maryland won by 11–1 in 1929, 14–2 in 1951, 17–10 in 1963 and 13–6 in 1965.\nFor this tournament as well as the 1972 tournament, the Wingate Memorial Trophy was presented to the winner.\nQualification.\nEight NCAA Division I college men's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season.\nCollege lacrosse at that time was broken into four divisions, so the NCAA tournament games for that year were based on geographical fit rather than seeding. The Tournament teams were selected from 114 schools which sponsored lacrosse at that time. Each division sent one team, two other teams were picked from the northern, southern and western divisions, and then two teams were chosen at large, chosen by a selection committee of five coaches and athletic directors.\nOverview.\nThe Cornell Big Red, who posted a 13–1 record during the season, were led by coach Richard M. Moran and star players Bob Rule, John Burnap, Bob Shaw, and Alan Rimmer, defeated the 9-3 Maryland Terrapins 12 to 6 in the finals. Cornell had won 13 straight games leading up to the title game, losing only their opener by one goal to Virginia. Cornell won despite their first team All American goaltender Bob Rule being out with an injury, he was injured in the quarterfinal game against Brown. Backup goaltender Bob Buhmann, who also was the backup ice hockey goaltender to Ken Dryden, started in place of Rule and was credited with 25 saves as the Big Red shut down the Maryland attack. Buhmann also ended up as an honorable mention All American that season, and all told made 52 saves in this tournament.\nCanadian-born Al Rimmer, the first Canadian born NCAA lacrosse recruit, scored six goals in the finals to lead Cornell. Rimmer, from Toronto, had led Cornell with 43 goals and 31 assists for 74 points for the season. He ended his career as the all-time Cornell record-holder in career points with 80 goals and 82 assists for 162 points.\nIn 1970 in just his second year, Coach Moran's team was the only squad in the nation to go undefeated with a record of 11–0, but controversy ensued when the USILA named Johns Hopkins, Navy and Virginia as the national champions, while Cornell was voted fifth in the country. The next season, after losing in the season opener to Virginia, 10–9, Cornell rattled off 13-straight victories. In the semi-finals, Cornell edged Army, 17–16, with Cornell grabbing a 7–4 lead after one period. Army, led by Tom Cafaro who had seven goals and three assists in the game, battled back and by the third period it became a question of who would get the last goal. The lead changed hands twice and the score was tied four times in the final period, before Bob Shaw scored at 12:33 giving Cornell the victory. Frank Davis' four goals against Army in the semi-finals ensured Cornell's place in the national championship. Cornell had not beaten Army in their previous 15 games.\nCoach Richie Moran was voted the Division I Coach of the Year, while John Burnap won the Schmeisser Award as the nation's outstanding defenseman and Bob Rule won the Ens. C.M. Kelly, Jr. Award as the nation's top goaltender, despite the fact that a season-ending knee injury kept Rule from playing in the NCAA tournament.\nIn the finals, Al Rimmer fired in six of Cornell's 12 goals, with Cornell never trailing in the game. Rimmer scored first at 59 seconds and though Maryland was able to tie the score at 2-2, the Terps posed no real threat after the first period. The goal that put Cornell ahead for good was produced by their third midfield. With 7:47 to go in the first period, Bob Wagner, a senior from Newton, Pa., scored off an assist by Craig Bollinger, a junior from Rochester, N.Y. Rimmer then took command and racked up three straight goals. Frank Davis, a junior from Sanborn, N.Y. and Bucky Gunts, a junior from Baltimore, Md. finished up Cornell's string of six straight goals.\nOutstanding player.\nTom Cafaro, Army&lt;br&gt;18 points, Tournament Leading Scorer"

        "text": "The 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (\"1987 WJHC\") was the 11th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship and was held in Piešťany, Trenčín, Nitra, and Topoľčany, Czechoslovakia. Finland captured its first World Junior gold medal, Czechoslovakia took silver, and Sweden the bronze. The tournament is most remembered, however, for how the medals were allocated.\nPunch-up in Piestany.\nWith 6:07 left in the second period of the final game of the tournament between Canada and the Soviet Union, Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury, sparking a fight between the two; the USSR's Evgeny Davydov left the bench to assist Valeri Zelepukin in the fight, who was already playing the game with a separated shoulder, and was being pummeled by Canadian forward Mike Keane. Davydov's intervention sparked one of the most infamous bench-clearing brawls in international hockey history.\nThe officials, unable to break up the brawl, walked off the ice and tournament officials eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the International Ice Hockey Federation declared the contest null and void. An emergency meeting was held following the brawl that ended with the delegates voting 7–1 to eject both teams from the tournament, with the sole dissenter being Canadian Dennis McDonald. The Canadian team, disgusted at what they perceived to be a conspiracy against them, chose to leave rather than stay for the end-of-tournament dinner, from which the Soviet team were banned.\nWhile the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4–2 at the time of the brawl (they needed to win by at least five goals to claim the gold). Even had they lost the game, they were assured at least the bronze medal. Afterwards, Soviet hockey official Anatoly Kastriukov claimed that the hostilities were fueled by a Canadian trainer who he alleged had punched one of the Soviet assistant coaches in the stomach. Some Canadians maintained that the Soviets had started the brawl by leaving their bench first, and had deliberately done so with the intention of getting Canada ejected. Alan Eagleson suggested that the IIHF's decision would have been different had it been the Soviets in contention for a medal, and not the Canadians. Soviet administrator Yuri Korolev expressed regret that the incident occurred but did not admit any guilt. He felt that the game should have been finished instead of both teams being disqualified from the tournament.\nThe ejections of the Canadian and Soviet teams had the retroactive effect of making the Finland-Czechoslovakia game (played earlier the same day) the gold medal game, while the Sweden-United States game became the bronze medal contest, and the Poland-Switzerland game determined who placed fifth. The loser of the latter game (Switzerland) was relegated, just as they were had the brawl not occurred. Poland avoided relegation despite giving up 80 goals in 7 games.\nFinal standings.\n\" was relegated to Pool B for the 1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\"\nPool B.\nTook place from March 15 to 21 in Rouen France. Two groups of four played round robins, the top two and bottom two from the respective groups met up in two final round robins to determine placement.

        "text": "The Kentucky High School Athletic Association boys' and girls' state basketball championships are single elimination tournaments held each March featuring 16 high schools. Colloquially known as the Sweet Sixteen (the KHSAA holds a trademark on the phrase). Since 2019, both the boys' and girls' tournaments takes place over four days at downtown Lexington's Rupp Arena.\nHistory.\nThe Kentucky High School Boys' Basketball State Tournament began in 1918. For fourteen years there were 18 regions that encompassed the tournament. Since 1932 there have only been 16 regions thus the term \"Sweet Sixteen\" was coined. Kentucky is one of only two states (Delaware is the other) that still play a state tournament without a class system that divides large and small schools into separate tournaments.\nThe first six tournaments were held at the University of Kentucky gymnasium in Lexington. After 1923 the tournament continued in Lexington but moved to the new Alumni Gymnasium on UK's campus which had become the new venue for the university's basketball teams, where it stayed from 1924 until 1944. In 1945 the tournament moved to the Louisville Gardens until 1950, when it moved back to Lexington and took up residence at Memorial Coliseum, again on the UK campus. Once construction was complete on Freedom Hall in Louisville, the 1957 tournament was held there and returned in odd-numbered years.\nIn 1965, Freedom Hall agreed to host the tournament for fourteen consecutive years until 1978. The opening of Rupp Arena in 1979 led to the tournament's return to Lexington, where it remains to the present day. However, Freedom Hall has hosted the tournament six times since then, the most recent being in 1994.\nBoth the boys' and girls' tournaments were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "title": "Auburn Tigers swimming and diving",
        "text": "The Auburn Tigers swimming and diving program is Auburn University's representative in the sport of swimming and diving. The Tigers compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 and are members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The program started in 1932 when the pool was in the basement of the gymnasium. The program had to telegraph their timed results to other schools and compare as the pool was too small for competitions.\nThe Tigers' first national champion was Scott Spann Sr, who won the 200m Individual Medley in 1978. The women's team became a full NCAA sport in 1982. David Marsh was hired in 1990 and he would make Auburn into a national powerhouse.\nUnder Marsh the program won a combined twelve NCAA championships. The men have won eight (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009) while the women have won five (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007). David Marsh stepped down at the end of the 2006-2007 season. He was replaced by former Auburn, Texas Longhorns and Stanford University head coach Richard Quick. The Tiger men won the 2009 national championship, the 8th for the men and 13th total for the program. In May 2009 assistant coach Brett Hawke was promoted to co-head coach to run the program together with Quick. On June 10, Coach Quick died after a six-month struggle with brain cancer. In March 2018, following the conclusion of the NCAA men's and women's championships, Hawke informed the team he would be resigning as the head coach after 10 seasons. On April 28, 2018 NC State Wolfpack assistant swimming coach Gary Taylor was named the eighth head coach of the program. Following the 2021 NCAA Championships in which the men's and women's teams failed to score any points, Auburn and Taylor mutually decided to part ways. Auburn athletics director Allen Greene announced a national search for Taylor's successor would begin immediately. On April 23, 2021 Auburn announced former Auburn swimmer Ryan Wochomurka was hired to be the new head coach of both the men's and women's teams.\nAuburn has regularly been represented in the Olympic games, with a University record eighteen swimmers at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games where five Auburn Tigers won a record twelve medals. At the same Olympics, Kirsty Coventry won her seventh Olympic medal to replace Auburn alumnus and NBC swimming commentator Rowdy Gaines at the top of the Auburn roster of Olympic medallists. Also in the Beijing games César Cielo Filho became the first Auburn swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal in the 50m Free Style event.\nHistory.\nAuburn's swimming and diving program got off to a modest start in 1932. Swimming in the basement of the Alumni Gym (which no longer exists on campus) the Tigers swam in a small pool which only had room for three lanes. Swimmers were timed and results were telegraphed to other schools for comparisons. The first real competitions were held in 1936, with ten swimmers competing. The Tigers first swam in the SEC Championships in 1940 and placed 5th. With the outbreak of World War II, Auburn stopped all intercollegiate sports and swimming was not reinstated after the war due to inadequate facilities. The team was reinstated in 1947, and reentered the SEC Championships in 1948. Throughout the 1950s and 60's, the program garnered little attention as it was mostly coached by volunteers and swimmers consisted of the fastest members of the university's mandatory swim classes.\nA new university swim team was formed in the fall of 1970, and two major changes helped transition the program into the modern era of collegiate swimming. A competition pool was constructed adjacent to Memorial Coliseum (renamed to Beard-Eaves Coliseum in 1993) through the support of university president Harry M. Philpott. In addition to a new pool, the university hired Bill Washington as the program's first official head coach. In 1973, Washington moved into a teaching role and the athletics department hired Eddie Reese to take over. The swim program experienced a rapid rise to national prominence under the leadership of Reese. Auburn finished 3rd in the SEC and 17th in the NCAA meet in 1974, the highest finish in school history at that time. The Tigers climbed up to second in the NCAA's by 1978, in which Auburn captured the first individual NCAA champion in school history when Scott Spann Sr. won the 200 IM and the 100 breaststroke. Following the 1978 season, Reese left the Auburn program to take over as the coach at the University of Texas. After his departure, Auburn hired Iowa State men's swimming coach Richard Quick to be Reese's successor. Auburn experienced continued success under Quick as the men finished in sixth at the 1979 NCAA championships and fifth in 1980 and 1981. In 1982, women's swimming became an official SEC sport, and the Auburn women's program finished fourth at the AIAW Championships. After the conclusion of the 1982 season, Quick left Auburn to become the coach of the women's program at the University of Texas, serving beside Eddie Reese. Auburn replaced Quick with John Asmuth, who was a swimmer during Reese's tenure at Auburn. Asmuth was known for helping coach two of Auburn's early Olympic swimmers, Rowdy Gaines and Per Johansson, but perhaps his best contribution to Auburn's swim program was James Martin Aquatics Center. Asmuth served as a key member in planning and gaining the support for the construction of the world-class natatorium. Asmuth served as the head coach for eight years where his teams finished in the top ten in three years and top twenty another three years.\nIn 1990, Auburn hired David Marsh who would take the Tigers to new heights. He led the 1994 men to an SEC title, the first in school history. That same year, the Tiger women won the medley relay, becoming the first team outside of Stanford, Texas, or Florida to win an NCAA title in a relay at the NCAA meet. The men would go on to win the 1997 national championship, the first team in Auburn history to win an NCAA title. The women swimmers became the first Auburn women's team to win an NCAA title in 2002. The women would then win the SEC title in 2003 for the first time, with the men also winning an SEC Championship (their seventh consecutive) marking the first time the men's and women's SEC championships were held by the same school. Later that year, the Auburn teams combined to sweep the NCAA titles, another first for men's and women's teams coached by the same person. Auburn had established itself as a national swimming power. Auburn had another first for a swimming program in 2005. After winning the 2005 national title the Auburn men's team became the first men's swimming and diving team invited to be honored at the White House by then President George W. Bush. The women joined the men the next year.\nDavid Marsh's career as Auburn head coach ended in March 2007 after leading the Tigers to the 2007 men's and women's national titles in his fourth sweep of the events. Marsh finished with 17 SEC Championships and a record-tying 12 national championships. The coach he tied is incoming Tigers coach Richard Quick who won 12 combined national titles as the Women's head coach for Texas and Stanford.\nIn 2008 the Auburn women finished second to Arizona Wildcats while the men finished in fifth place.\nIn 2009 the Tigers reclaimed the Men's national title by edging out second place Texas by 39 points. The 2009 title was the eighth for the men and the 13th overall for Auburn. It also marked Richard Quick's 13th title after winning twelve at Stanford and Texas. He moved ahead of former Auburn coach David Marsh for the most titles for a coach in his career and became the first coach to win national titles at three schools.\nDuring the 2008-2009 season Brett Hawke, a former Auburn swimmer himself, took over the day-to-day running of the men's program after Richard Quick was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After the season Auburn Athletics Director Jay Jacobs announced that Hawke would be promoted to co-head coach and would work with both the Men's and Women's programs while consulting with Quick.\nUnder the leadership of Hawke, the men's team captured the 2010, 2011, and 2012 SEC championships, but failed to win another national title after 2009. In March 2018, following the NCAA men's and women's championships, Hawke informed the team he would be resigning from his position. The athletics department, under the new leadership of athletic director Allen Greene, immediately began searching for Hawke's successor. On April 28, 2018 NC State Wolfpack assistant swimming coach Gary Taylor was named the new head coach. Taylor immediately faced a challenging situation as two of the program's top swimmers, Zach Apple and Hugo Gonzalez, announced their intent to transfer following Taylor's arrival. On April 19, 2021, Auburn athletics director Allen Greene announced that Auburn and coach Gary Taylor had mutually agreed to part ways, and a national search for his successor would begin immediately. At the 2021 NCAA Championships, both the men's and women's programs failed to score any points.\nOn April 23, 2021 former Auburn swimmer Ryan Wochomurka was announced as the new head coach of the program. Wochomurka formerly served as the head coach of the Houston Cougars women's swimming and diving program. Wochomurka swam at Auburn from 2002–2005 where he was a 21-time All-American.\nFacilities.\nThe Auburn Swimming and Diving program competes in the James E. Martin Aquatics Center. The center first opened in the 1993 and was designed to be one of the premier natatoriums in collegiate swimming and diving. The James E. Martin Aquatics Center has hosted multiple competitions including the SEC Championships three times, the NCAA Championships twice, as well the 1995, 2000, and 2005 U.S. Open competitions. In the months leading up to the Atlanta Olympic Games swimming teams from Israel, China, Japan, South Africa, and Finland used the facility to train while the US Olympic Water Polo also used the facility.\nThe facility cost $10.5 million and was a pet project of its namesake, former Auburn University President James E. Martin. Seating at the center has room for 1,000 spectators and an additional 800 poolside seats for competitors. The competition pool features a state of the art gutter system that absorbs waves instead of reverberating back into the pool, which creates a calmer swimming surface. The bulkheads also provide a flow-through design to prevent waves on turns. The pool is nine feet deep at the shallowest and below the diving apparatus. The entire pool is long (232 ft) and 25 yards (75 ft) wide. The bulkheads are movable and allow variable lengths for competition and practice as well as simultaneous diving. The facility also features the original Auburn competition pool, renovated as a warm-up and practice pool.\nIn the summer of 2007, Auburn University completed work on a new $1 million outdoor training pool, part of a large scale effort by the Auburn Athletics Department to improve the school's facilities.\nMen's swimming and diving.\nOn top of their seven national titles, the Auburn men have won several SEC championships. Since their first SEC Championship in 1994, Auburn has won 14 out of the last 15 SEC titles, including 13 straight since 1996. Only Tennessee has broken Auburn's SEC championship streak. Between January 11, 2001 and January 11, 2007 Auburn did not lose a single dual meet (meets in between 2 or 3 teams only). The only team to beat Auburn during that time period was arch swimming rival Texas, when they snapped the Tigers 44 consecutive dual meet winning streak by a score of 130-113.\nThe 2006 Men's Swimming and Diving senior class, consisting of Kurt Cady, George Bovell, Eric Shanteau, and Doug Van Wie finished as the only senior class in AU History for any sport to go undefeated their entire college career. They never lost a Dual, SEC, or NCAA meet.\nThe 2007 Men's SEC Championship team dominated the conference competition, winning by 114.5 points over the second place Florida. The men's team won 11 individual conference titles, including sweeping all diving and relay events.\nLike the conference, Auburn's men dominated the 2007 NCAA championship meet. The Tigers scored 566 points in the meet, easily outdistancing second place Stanford who scored 397 points, a difference of 169. On the very first swim of the meet, the freestyle relay, the Tigers set a new NCAA record in the prelims which they then broke in the championship final (1:14.71). Auburn would go on to set NCAA records in four more events, the 50 Free (César Cielo, 18.69), 100 Free (César Cielo, 41.17), the 400 Free relay (2:46.56), and the 200 Medley Relay (1:23.37). César Cielo became the first Auburn swimmer since Rowdy Gaines to win the 100 Free national title, and the first Auburn swimmer to win the 100 and 50 free in the same NCAA meet. Auburn diver Steven Segerlin repeated his 2006 Platform diving championship and won the 3M Springboard title to go with his third place in the 1M Springboard. Auburn was awarded for its dominance by sweeping the post meet awards, David Marsh was named NCAA Division I Men's Swimming Coach of the Year, head diving coach Jeff Shafer was named NCAA Division I Men's Diving Coach of the Year, César Cielo was named NCAA Division I Men's Swimmer of the Year and Steven Segerlin was named NCAA Division I Men's Diver of the Year.\nIn the 2009 SEC Championship meet, Auburn's men won first place for the 13th consecutive time, tying a conference record. Auburn was led by Matt Targett, who won seven individual SEC championships, winning every event he entered. He was named SEC Male Swimmer of the year for his efforts. In the 2009 national championships held in College Station, Texas Auburn trailed rival Texas for the first two days of the competition. In the final day of competition Auburn took the lead during the first two events and held on to win the eighth national title for the men's team. The Auburn men's team continued their streak of SEC Championships by winning the conference meet in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The Florida Gators ended Auburn's streak of sixteen straight championships when they won the men's 2013 SEC Swimming &amp; Diving Championship.\nWomen's swimming and diving.\nAuburn's women's team have won five national titles (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007). They have been SEC Champions four time times (2003, 2004, 2005, 2007). In 2005, Auburn lost to Georgia by two points at the NCAA championships and in the SEC Championships in 2006. The second-place finisher at the SEC championships went on to win the national championship while the SEC champion won national runner-up in 2005 and 2006. The 2007 SEC Championships saw the close competition between the Dogs and Tigers come to an end, as Auburn beat Georgia by 228 points while Georgia finished 5th in the NCAA championships to Auburn's first-place finish. At the 2007 SEC Championships the women posted a school record for individual conference titles won at 12 and took home 19 All-American honors for the national championships.\nIn 2009 the Auburn women finished second to the Florida Gators in the SEC Championships.\nNCAA team championships.\nThe Tigers have won a combined 13 NCAA championships. When looking at all time results with men's and women's championships combined, the Auburn Tigers rank third behind Texas (20 combined NCAA championships) and Stanford (17 combined NCAA championships). The Auburn women rank third all time with 5 NCAA championships behind Stanford (8) and Texas (7). The Auburn men rank tied for fifth all time with Stanford, each with 8 NCAA titles. The Tigers and Cardinal are behind Texas (13), Michigan (12), Ohio State (11), and USC (9). With their 2007 national title, Auburn's men joined Michigan and Indiana as the only teams to win five consecutive national titles.\nSoutheastern Conference Championships.\nAuburn has won 23 SEC championships in program history. Auburn's women have won five SEC titles, their last coming in 2008. The Auburn men have won 18 conference titles, including 16 straight from 1997-2012. \nAuburn swimmers in international events.\nAuburn has sent many swimmers to the Olympic games and other international competitions Auburn Swimmers compete for their home countries in events such as the Goodwill Games, Pan-Pacific Games, World University Games and the FINA World Championships, which is similar to the World Cup in soccer, where Auburn Swimmers have won as of 2006 18 gold medals.\n2007 Pan-American Games.\nAt the 2007 Pan-American Games Auburn swimmers won a school record 13 medals including eight golds. The top Auburn swimmers in the event were César Cielo with two golds and a Pan-Am Record of 21.84 in the 50 freestyle. Cielo won two more medals on relay teams. Emily Kukors of Auburn won two golds, becoming the first Auburn female swimmer to win multiple golds in the Pan-American games, in the 800 free relay and the 400 free relay for the USA team. She also captured silver in the 200 IM.\nAuburn Olympians.\nIn the most well known international swimming competition, the Olympics, 30 Auburn swimmers and divers have competed for 14 countries with 8 swimmers taking home medals. Auburn coaches David Marsh and Jeff Shaffer as well as incoming coach Richard Quick have all coached US teams in the Olympics as well. The two most decorated Auburn Olympians are Rowdy Gaines and Kirsty Coventry. Gaines competed in the 1984 Los Angeles games, where he won three gold medals in the 100 Freestyle and in the 400 Free relay and the 400 Medley Relay for the United States of America. Coventry became the first Auburn woman swimmer to medal in an Olympics in the 2004 Athens games when she won gold, silver and bronze in the 200 backstroke, 100 backstroke, and the 200 Individual Medley respectively. She is the first and (as of 2008) the only person ever to medal in an individual event in the Olympics for her native country, Zimbabwe. In the 2008 Olympics, Coventry surpassed Rowdy Gaines in most medals won in a single games (four) and in career medals (seven) for the swimming program. In total for the 2004 Athens games, Auburn sent 12 athletes to the games with five medals, a then Auburn record-tying performance for a single Olympics.

        "text": "The 13th Ryder Cup Matches were held November 6–7, 1959 at the Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells, California. The United States team won the competition by a score of 8 to 3 points.\nThe British were again led by Dai Rees, but were unable to repeat the heroics of two years earlier and were comprehensively beaten on American soil. The Americans took a 2–1 lead in the foursomes before finishing off the British challenge in the singles by winning five matches with two matches finishing all square to win the cup back. The British won just one foursome match with Christy O'Connor and Peter Alliss beating Art Wall Jr. and Doug Ford by 3 &amp; 2 and one singles match when Eric Brown beat Cary Middlecoff by 4 &amp; 3 however by the time his match was won the United States had already won the competition.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. Since the inaugural event in 1927, the format consisted of four foursome (alternate shot) matches on the first day and eight singles matches on the second day, for a total of 12 points. Therefore, 6 points were required to win the Cup, and all matches were played to a maximum of 36 holes. This was the last Ryder Cup played under this format.\nTeams.\nSource:\nSeven members of the British team were chosen using a Ryder Cup points system based on performances during the 1959 season. The first event was the PGA Close Championship starting on 8 April with the final event being the Irish Hospitals Tournament finishing on 12 July. The seven qualifiers were Hunt, Rees, Weetman, Mills, Alliss, Drew and O'Connor. The remaining three, Bousfield, Brown and Thomas, were selected by the P.G.A. tournament committee in late September, after the Dunlop Masters.\nThe British team sailed from Southampton on 15 October on the \"Queen Elizabeth\". Mills had a back injury while the team was in Washington and was to be replaced by John Panton. However, he recovered enough to attend the event, although he was not chosen to play any matches; Hunt was also not in full health, suffering from bronchial trouble. The British team had a rough trip on a short flight from Los Angeles to Palm Springs and nearly all the players were ill, with some taking several days to recover.\nFriday's foursome matches.\nTwo matches went to the last hole. Boros and Finsterwald were 1 up against Rees and Bousfield playing the last. The match ended when the British pair put their second shot in the water and took 4 to reach the green. Weetman and Thomas were 1 up against Snead and Middlecoff at the last. Snead put his second in the water but rather than playing short, Weetman also put his second in the water. Middlecoff then chipped to 8 feet and Snead holed the putt to win the hole and halve the match. Weetman received some criticism for his decision not to lay-up.\n18 hole scores: Rosburg/Souchak: 6 up, Boros/Finsterwald: 1 up, O'Connor/Alliss: 2 up, Snead/Middlecoff: 1 up.\nSaturday's singles matches.\nThe Americans got off to a good start in many of the matches and had large leads in five of the matches at lunch. Eric Brown was the only British winner on the day.\n18 hole scores: Ford: 1 up, Souchak: 4 up, Rosburg: 4 up, Snead: 4 up, Wall: 5 up, Finsterwald: 5 up, Alliss: 1 up, Brown: 3 up.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource:\nUnited States.\nJack Burke Jr. did not play in any matches.\nGreat Britain.\nPeter Mills did not play in any matches."

        "text": "The 12th Ryder Cup Matches were held 4–5 October 1957 at Lindrick Golf Club near Worksop, England. The Great Britain team, led by captain Dai Rees, beat the United States team by a score of 7 to 4 points, and won the Ryder Cup for the first time since 1933.\nOn the first day of competition was the Americans dominated the foursomes, winning three of the four matches. Dick Mayer and Tommy Bolt's 7 &amp; 5 win over Britain's Christy O'Connor and Eric Brown was the largest margin of victory on day one.\nThe British rallied on the second day of competition, starting with the first two singles matches. Brown recorded a 4 &amp; 3 victory over Bolt, and Peter Mills defeated U.S. captain Jack Burke Jr. to draw Britain level at 3 to 3. The Americans responded when Fred Hawkins won his match against Peter Alliss, however Britain won the next four matches. Great Britain won the Ryder Cup when O'Connor defeated Dow Finsterwald, giving the British team 7 points. Harry Bradshaw and Mayer halved the final singles match to bring the final score to 7 to 4, with Britain gaining 6 points in the eight singles matches.\nDai Rees therefore became only the third - and final - captain of the Great Britain side to lift the Ryder Cup as winning captain. Great Britain would never win the Ryder Cup again, and the Great Britain &amp; Ireland team that competed in 1973, 1975 and 1977 never won the cup. It would not be until 1985 that a non-American (Tony Jacklin, as captain of the Europe team) would lift the trophy. \nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. From 1927 through 1959, the format consisted of 4 foursome (alternate shot) matches on the first day and 8 singles matches on the second day, for a total of 12 points. Therefore, 6 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 36 holes.\nSir Stuart Goodwin.\nThe event was supported by Sir Stuart Goodwin. He offered the P.G.A. £10,000 to host the match at Lindrick, the gate money going to the P.G.A. who were responsible for all payments in connection with the match. With gate receipts of £16,127 the £10,000 donation enabled the P.G.A. to make a record profit of about £11,000 out of the event.\nTeams.\nSource: \nA new system of selection was used for the Great Britain team. A points system based on performances over a two-year period ending after the 1957 Open Championship was used. Winners of the 1957 Open Championship and the 1957 News of the World Match Play were guaranteed places provided they were British. The remaining places to complete the team of 10 were selected from the points list. Following the 1957 Open, nine places were finalised, the leading nine in the point list: Brown, Weetman, Bradshaw, Bousfield, Alliss, Rees, Faulkner, O'Connor and Hunt. Mills was 10th in the list. Rees was again chosen as the captain. With O'Connor winning the News of the World Match Play, Mills became the last member of the team.\nThe 1957 Amateurs–Professionals Match was played at Lindrick in early August. It was intended that the match would be between the Ryder Cup and Walker Cup teams, to give both teams some competitive experience and for the Ryder Cup team to gain experience of the Lindrick course. In the event, two of the Ryder Cup team, Christy O'Connor Snr and Harry Weetman were ill and replaced by Eric Lester and local professional, 49-year-old Jack Jacobs.\nFriday's foursome matches.\n18 hole scores: Ford/Finsterwald: 1 up, Bousfield/Rees v Wall/Hawkins: all square, Kroll/Burke: 1 up, Mayer/Bolt: 3 up.\nSaturday's singles matches.\n18 hole scores: Brown: 4 up, Mills: 5 up, Hawkins: 1 up, Bousfield: 5 up, Rees: 4 up, Hunt: 1 up, O'Connor/Finsterwald: all square, Mayer: 1 up.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource: \nWeetman suspension.\nAt a meeting on 21 October, Harry Weetman was suspended by the executive committee of the P.G.A. for twelve months. This was following his actions after being left out of the second day singles matches. Weetman had declared that he would never play in any Ryder Cup again if Rees were the captain. Weetman was unable to play in P.G.A. events. The decision was upheld at the annual meeting of the P.G.A. in November. Following an appeal from Rees the P.G.A. lifted the suspension on 17 April 1958.\nRyder Cup Reunion Foursomes Tournament.\nIn 1964, Stuart Goodwin sponsored a £1,000 Ryder Cup Reunion Foursomes tournament at Hallamshire Golf Club. Each member of the successful Britain and Ireland team from the 1957 Ryder Cup was paired with a Yorkshire or Nottinghamshire professional in the 72-hole foursomes event, played over two days. Christy O'Connor was ill and was replaced by a local professional. Ken Bousfield and Alex Caygill won the event with a score of 292, two ahead of three couples on 294."

The United States team won its sixth consecutive competition by a score of 6 to 5 points.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. From 1927 through 1959, the format consisted of 4 foursome (alternate shot) matches on the first day and 8 singles matches on the second day, for a total of 12 points. Therefore, 6 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 36 holes.\nTeams.\nSource:\nThe British team was selected by the tournament committee of the P.G.A. with power to add to their numbers. In January 1953 Henry Cotton was chosen as captain and was co-opted onto the selection committee. In mid-August a group of 17 was announced from which the team would be chosen. This consisted of the eventual team of 10 plus Cotton, Tom Haliburton, Jack Hargreaves, Sam King, Arthur Lees, Norman Sutton and Charlie Ward. John Jacobs was later added to the list. Cotton withdrew from consideration for medical reasons. The P.G.A. arranged a series of trial matches at Wentworth starting on 23 September with the team announced on 26 September.\nThe American team was announced in early August, after the 1953 All American Open. The 1952 and 1953 winners of the PGA Championship received automatic places. The remaining 8 members of the team were decided using a points-based system. Ben Hogan and Dutch Harrison qualified but declined their invitations. They were replaced Dave Douglas and Fred Haas, the next two in the points list.\nFriday's foursome matches.\nIn the middle two matches the American pairs won easily after being 8 up and 7 up at lunch. In the first match Douglas and Oliver led by three after three holes of the afternoon round. The British pair reduced the lead to one with six holes to play. Both pairs holes good putts at the 15th but the British pair bogeyed the 16th to be dormie-two. Oliver drove out of bounds at the 17th but the British pair took 6 and the hole was halved. In the final match, Daly and Bradshaw were three up at lunch but lost the first two holes in the afternoon. Daly and Bradshaw's lead increased to 3 at the turn but then the Americans reduced the lead to one. Bradshaw had some luck at the 16th when his drive hit a spectator and the hole was halved. Middlecoff missed a 7-foot putt at the 17th which would have tied the match. The American pair got a 4 at the last but Daly holed from 3 yards to win the match.\n18 hole scores: Douglas/Oliver: 1 up, Mangrum/Snead: 8 up, Kroll/Burke: 7 up, Daly/Bradshaw: 3 up.\nSaturday's singles matches.\nThe start was delayed by 80 minutes because of mist. At lunch each side was up in three matches with the other two matches level. Rees was ahead after 12 holes of the afternoon round but lost 2 &amp; 1. Daly was 6 up at lunch and won his match easily. Mangrum had levelled his match against Brown with birdies at the 15th and 16th but Brown finished with two fours to win the match. Snead was 4 up at lunch and increased this to five. However he played the last six holes very badly and Weetman won at the last hole, finishing with two fours.\nWith Middlecoff and Bradshaw winning their matches, the British team needed 1 points from the remaining 2 matches to win or a point to tie. The two British players in these matches were 22-year-old Peter Alliss and 23-year-old Bernard Hunt. Alliss had gone 1 up at the 14th but he 3-putted the 15th while Turnesa got down in two from a bunker. Alliss went out of bounds at the 17th to give Turnesa the lead. Turnesa was in the trees at the last and still short of the green in 3. However, Alliss, just off the green in 2, fluffed his chip, and eventually halved the hole in 6, to guarantee that the USA would retain the Ryder Cup. In the last match Hunt had won the 12th, 13th, 16th and 17th to be dormie-one. At the last, Hunt's second shot was in the trees on the right but he managed to get his third shot to the back of the green. He putted to 4 feet and, with Douglas taking 5, he needed to hole the putt to win the match. He missed and so the USA won 6 to 5.\n18 hole scores: Rees v Burke: all square, Daly: 6 up, Brown: 2 up, Snead: 4 up, Middlecoff: 3 up, Turnesa: 1 up, Hunt v Douglas: all square, Bradshaw: 1 up.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource:\nContinental Europe–United States match.\nIn January 1953 the PGA of America received an invitation from the European Golf Association to play a match against a team of European professionals. A match was arranged by the EGA and the French Golf Federation, played at Golf de Saint-Cloud, Saint-Cloud, Paris on 6 and 7 October. The match consisted of 5 fourball matches on the first day and 10 singles on the second day, all matches over 18 holes. Originally foursomes matches were planned for the first day but were replaced by fourballs.\nEd Oliver returned to America after the Ryder Cup. He was replaced by PGA officials, Warren Orlick on the first day and Ray Maguire on the second day. The continental europe team was Jean Baptiste Ado, Alfonso Angelini, Georg Bessner, Aldo Casera, Arthur Devulder, Gerard de Wit, Ugo Grappasonni, Marcelino Morcillo, Albert Pélissier and François Saubaber. Ángel Miguel was originally announced in the team but was replaced by Marcelino Morcillo. The team therefore had three players from France and Italy, and one each from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Auguste Boyer was the non-playing captain. The leading European golfer, Flory Van Donck, did not play. Van Donck had already won four continental open championships in 1953 and two British tournaments. However, the match clashed with the Dunlop Masters which was played on 7 and 8 October. Van Donck was the only continental player competing in the limited field of 20.\nThe United States led 4–1 after the first day. The Italian pair of Alfonso Angelini and Ugo Grappasonni beat Jim Turnesa and Warren Orlick 2 &amp; 1. On the second day Europe won one match and halved two, giving a final score of 12–3. None of the American Ryder Cup team lost, Europe's only win was by Marcelino Morcillo who beat Ray Maguire. Albert Pélissier halved his match against Walter Burkemo while Grappasonni also halved against Lloyd Mangrum.\nFrom 1954 to 1958 the EGA arranged a similar match between the British Isles and the Rest of Europe for the Joy Cup."

World War II forced cancellations from 1939 to 1945; the last competition was in 1937. The United States overwhelmed the British team, 11–1.\nAn invitation to renew the Ryder Cup was sent by the American P.G.A. in November 1946. This was accepted by the British P.G.A. in December. However it was not until August 1947 that the dates and venue were agreed.\nThe revival of the Ryder Cup in 1947 was initiated by Portland businessman Robert A. Hudson, who paid for the expenses of the teams and chaired the event. He even met the British team in New York, threw a lavish party at the Waldorf-Astoria, and accompanied them on the four-day rail journey across the U.S. to Portland.\nThe course had hosted the stroke play Portland Open on the PGA Tour in 1944 and 1945, won by Sam Snead and Ben Hogan, and the match play PGA Championship in August 1946, won by Hogan.\nThe American team won all four matches on the opening day and continued to dominate by winning all but one singles match. The only British victory in the competition came when Sam King beat Herman Keiser 4 &amp; 3.\nPlayed in the Pacific Northwest in November in wind and rain, soft course conditions prevailed as a week-long rain preceded the event.

        "text": "The world records in swimming are ratified by World Aquatics (formerly known as FINA), the international governing body of swimming. Records can be set in long course (50 metres) or short course (25 metres) swimming pools. World Aquatics recognizes world records in the following events for both men and women, except for the mixed relays, where teams consist of two men and two women, in any order.\nThe ratification process is described in FINA Rule SW12, and involves submission of paperwork certifying the accuracy of the timing system and the length of the pool, satisfaction of FINA rules regarding swimwear and a negative doping test by the swimmer(s) involved. Records can be set at intermediate distances in an individual race and for the first leg of a relay race. Records which have not yet been fully ratified are marked with a '#' symbol in these lists.\nSome of the records below were established by swimmers wearing bodysuits or suits made of polyurethane or other non-textile materials allowed in the race pool from February 2008 until December 2009. On the eve of the 2009 FINA World Championships in Rome, the international governing body for five Olympic aquatic sports voted to ban the use of bodysuits and all suits made of non-textile materials starting 1 January 2010. The suits seemed to improve the performance in those with larger physiques, boosting performance in some athletes more than others, depending on morphology and physiology. Since then, best times set by swimmers wearing textile materials have once again overtaken more than half of the world records recognized by World Aquatics.\nOn 25 July 2013, FINA Technical Swimming Congress voted to allow world records in the long course mixed 400 free relay and mixed 400 medley relay, as well as in six events in short course meters: the mixed 200 medley and 200 free relays, as well as the men's and women's 200 free relays and the men's and women's 200 medley relays. In October 2013, FINA decided to establish \"standards\" before something can be recognized as the first World Record in these events. But later on 13 March 2014 FINA has officially ratified the eight world records set by Indiana University swimmers at the IU Relay Rally held on 26 September 2013 in Bloomington.\nLong course (50m pool).\nMen.\n\"ss – supersuited/non-textile world record\"\nWomen.\n\"ss – supersuited/non-textile world record\"\nShort course (25m pool).\nMen.\n\"ss – supersuited/non-textile world record\"\n\"WB - world best time swam that will not be ratified by FINA.\"\nWomen.\n\"ss – supersuited/non-textile world record\""

The United States team won the competition by a score of 9 to 3 points.\nThe course was the venue for U.S. Open in 1926, won by amateur Bobby Jones, the second of his four titles. It later hosted the PGA Championship in 1950. Scioto is also noteworthy as the club where Jack Nicklaus learned to play as a youth in the 1950s.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point.

Therefore, 6 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 36 holes.\nTeams.\nSource:\nPrior to the match, there was some controversy about the qualification rules for the Great Britain team. In 1927 and 1929 the American PGA had decided to only select American born and resident players but the original Ryder Cup Deed of Trust made no such provision. All members of the Professional Golfers' Association were eligible. In late 1929 the Deed of Trust was revised requiring players to be born in and resident in their respective countries. This rule disqualified Percy Alliss and Aubrey Boomer, two of Great Britain's best players, as they had both taken jobs as club professionals in mainland Europe.\nIn early 1931, it was announced that a selection committee of five would choose the Great Britain team for the 1931 Ryder Cup. This committee consisted of George Oke, Charles Whitcombe, Charles Corlett, Dick Wheildon and Albert Haskins. Charles Whitcombe was announced as the captain. An initial squad of 24 was announced.\nHenry Cotton objected to a team rule requiring all players to travel out together and return together. Cotton wished to remain in the United States after the match. As a consequence Cotton was withdrawn from the squad.\nFour trial matches were played in which the new American sized ball was used, and in early May a further six players were selected: Compston, Davies, Jolly, Mitchell, Robson and Ernest Whitcombe. Duncan and Easterbrook were later added. During the final day of The Open Championship, Cotton was again asked whether he would play under the original conditions but again declined and the following day Hodson was announced as the final selection. In a further statement the same day it was announced that Herbert Jolly had withdrawn because of a lack of form and had been replaced by Havers. Jolly had scored 84 and 78 in the Open Championship qualifying the previous week.\nThe British team sailed on June 10 following a farewell dinner the previous evening.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource:\nUnited States.\nHorton Smith did not play in any matches."

About two thousand spectators saw America gain a narrow lead after the foursome matches before the Great Britain team won singles on the final day and thus the competition by a score of 7–5 points.

Therefore, 6 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 36 holes.\nTeams.\nSource: \nIn late 1928, it was announced that a selection committee of five professional golfers would choose the Great Britain team for the 1929 Ryder Cup. This committee consisted of James Braid, Sandy Herd and J.H. Taylor together with James Batley and Bob McKenzie. In January 1929, the team of 10 (as below) were selected with Duncan as captain.\nThe American team sailed on the Mauretania and arrived in Plymouth on 16 April and travelled to London the same day.\nDiegel celebrated his 30th birthday on the second day of the match.\nIt was originally planned that, as in 1927, only eight players should be used by each team. However, Hagen wished to use all 10 of his players. This was agreed to, although Duncan announced that he would only select eight as originally intended. Alliss and Burns were left out.\nThe Americans stayed in Europe to play in a number of tournaments and exhibition matches. The 1929 Open Championship played from 8 to 10 May was dominated by Americans. Hagen won with Farrell second and Diegel third. Two more of the American Ryder Cup team were in the top 10 which also included three more golfers then resident in the United States but born in the UK. The whole team played in the Yorkshire Evening News One Thousand Guineas Tournament at Moortown from 14 to 18 May which was won by Joe Turnesa. Horton Smith then won the French PGA Championship at St. Cloud on his 21st birthday. Smith had a 12 shot lead after the first day and although a third round 61 by Aubrey Boomer reduced his lead to five, Smith won the tournament by five strokes. Smith, Farrell and Hagen finished second, third and fourth in the German Open, a tournament won by Percy Alliss. It was not until 2 June that Hagen, Farrell, Turnesa, Dudley and Smith sailed from Southampton to return to New York.\nFriday's foursome matches.\nAn unusual feature of the Moortown course was that all the five short holes were even numbered holes. This meant that the same player had the tee shot at those holes. In the Diegel/Espinosa pairing Diegel had the tee shots at the short holes and with some excellent irons shots and good putting from Espinosa they had three twos at these holes. At lunch they were round in 66, despite a 6 at the second hole, and were 7 holes up. The remaining match were all close with the American having small leads in two matches and the other match level.\nThe Charles Whitcombe/Compston v Farrell/Turnesa match was always close and when the British pair levelled the match at the 15th hole of the second round, it was the fifth time they had got back to all square. The British pair then won the 16th with the 17th hole halved. At the last Whitcombe drove into a gorse bush which meant that Compston had to take a penalty shot. The American pair were also in trouble and their second shot finished near a fence with a refreshment tent between the ball and the green. Farrell having just enough room for his back-swing, played over the tent and finished 7 feet from the hole. the British pair could do no better than 6 and so the Americans won the hole to halve the match. In the final match, Golden and Hagen were 4 up early in the second round but Ernest Whitcombe and Cotton levelled the match. The Americans then won the last two holes to take the match.\n18 hole scores: Farrell/Turnesa: 1 up, Diegel/Espinosa: 7 up, Mitchell/Robson v Sarazen/Dudley: all square, Golden/Hagen: 2 up.\nSaturday's singles matches.\nAt lunch three of the eight matches were almost decided with Charles Whitcombe and Duncan having commanding leads for the British team and Diegel in a similar situation for the Americans. Boomer won the last four holes in the morning to go from 2 down to 2 up. Cotton was one down playing the last hole of the morning. His second shot ended up on a path between the gorse bushes but he chipped in for a three to halve the match. Compston won the first three holes in the afternoon to go 4 up but then lost three to go back to 1 up before winning comfortably 6 &amp; 4. With Boomer winning his match, the British team needed either Cotton or Ernest Whitcombe to get a point for Britain to win the Ryder Cup. Cotton won his match at the 15th to give Great Britain the victory and with Ernest Whitcombe going dormie at the 16th a sixth point of the day seemed likely. However Espinosa won the last two holes to halve the match.\n18 hole scores: Charles Whitcombe: 6 up, Duncan: 5 up, Diegel: 5 up, Compston: 1 up, Boomer: 2 up, Robson v Smith: all square, Cotton v Watrous: all square, Ernest Whitcombe v Espinosa: all square.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource: \nGreat Britain.\nPercy Alliss and Stewart Burns did not play in any matches."

        "text": "The 1993 UEFA Champions League final was a football match between French club Marseille and Italian club Milan, played on 26 May 1993 at the Olympiastadion in Munich.\nThe final, which followed the second-ever UEFA Champions League group stage, saw Ivorian-born Marseille defender Basile Boli score the only goal of the match in the 43rd minute with a header to give \"l'OM\" their first European Cup title. It was the first time a French team had won the European Cup. No other French side – apart from Monaco-based AS Monaco, who play in the French league system – would reach the final until Paris Saint-Germain in 2020.\nMarseille and their club president Bernard Tapie would later be found to have been involved in a match-fixing scandal during the 1992–93 season (in which Marseille allegedly paid Valenciennes to lose a match), which saw them relegated to Division 2 and banned from participation in European football for the following season. As the scandal affected only French league matches, Marseille's status as 1993 European champion was not affected.\nThe first Champions League final turned out to be the last game of Milan's highly accomplished but injury-prone Dutch forward Marco van Basten, who was 28 at the time; having been subbed off in the 86th minute due to fatigue and yet another ankle injury, he would spend the next two years in recovery before announcing his retirement in August 1995.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nAftermath.\nMarseille's triumph remains controversial due to accusations of doping alleged by Marcel Desailly, Jean-Jacques Eydelie, Chris Waddle and Tony Cascarino. According to Eydelie, \"all (of them) took a series of injections\" in the 1993 Champions League final, except Rudi Völler. Desailly and Cascarino claimed that club president Bernard Tapie distributed pills and injections himself. In an interview with French magazine \"Le Point\", Jean-Pierre de Mondenard said Marseille had a blackboard in their team locker room that read \"injections for everyone\". Tapie only admitted that some players took captagon."

        "text": "Shane Walker (born 1 March 1978) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. He played in the National Rugby League for the Brisbane Broncos and South Sydney, mostly in the position of .\nBackground.\nWalker was born in Toowoomba, Queensland. While attending St Mary's High School in 1995, Walker was selected to play for the Australian Schoolboys team.\nPlaying career.\nLike his elder brother Ben and younger brother Chris, Walker started playing in the National Rugby League with the Brisbane Broncos. Having won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos traveled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Walker playing from the interchange bench in Brisbane's loss. Walker later moved to the South Sydney club.\nIn 2019, Walker spoke about his time at South Sydney saying \"I went to Souths because Chris was going there. I’d heard how easy it was to get mixed up with the wrong crowd in Sydney. I thought there was a fair chance he could go off the rails… so I went down to help him out. I wasted my time, didn’t I? Ten weeks later he went to the Sydney Roosters\".\n\"I understood the significance of playing at Souths and the history. I recognised that I was lucky to wear the red and green play for Souths. You’d win a game, come up the escalators into the leagues club at Redfern and the place would be packed. The supporters would be in the auditorium and different guys would get up and talk and they’d be whipped into a frenzy. It was wonderful because in that Redfern area there are a lot of battlers. On top of that they fought like hell to get their team back in the comp. There was a lingering memory of that and the thought that perhaps their team might be taken away from them if they didn’t start winning. They were always proud of you – but they wanted a winning team to be happy about\".\nPost playing.\nWalker became co-head Coach of the Ipswich Jets who play in the Queensland Cup alongside his brother Ben.\nFamily.\nWalker is married to Katie Walker, a former Australian netball player. Their first child, a daughter, Kobi, was born in November 2006."

        "title": "List of The Prince of Tennis characters",
        "text": "\"The Prince of Tennis\" manga and anime series has a large cast of fictional characters created by Takeshi Konomi; many have appeared in the musical and film adaptations. The cast of the series is largely made up of the members of the various tennis teams for the schools portrayed in the series, their coaches, and various family members and supporters.\nThe main character of the series is Ryoma Echizen, a 12-year-old tennis prodigy who joins the Seishun Academy tennis team. The main cast is rounded out with the other eight regular players for Seishun, all of whom have various special abilities at playing tennis. Beyond them, there are many rival schools whose players reappear during the course of the series.\nProtagonists.\nThe protagonists of the series all attend , or for short. The school is famous for its talented tennis club in which the series' leading protagonist, Ryoma Echizen, is enrolled in the school by his father, Nanjiro Echizen, a former professional tennis player and Seigaku alumni. Although Seigaku has long been known for its tennis club, the void created by Nanjiro's departure years earlier throws the team into somewhat of a slump, leaving them unable to make it to Nationals over the next several years until a first year, Tezuka, joins the team. The story picks up two years later, with Tezuka now in his third year. The team slowly reforms, and Seigaku pulls off its first National victory with Ryoma's addition to the team.\nRyoma Echizen.\nRyoma is the series protagonist and the only first year on the Seigaku tennis team. His play style is all rounder, and his signature serve is the \"Twist serve\", a variation on the standard topspin serve where the ball is hit with a combination of both topspin and sidespin, allowing the ball to bounce high and curve toward the receivers' face. His arsenal of skills also include the Drive A, B, C, and D, the Cool Drive, the Samurai Drive, and Cyclone Smash. His strengths include his ability to analyze his opponents' abilities during the match and adapt his own play accordingly to take advantage of their weaknesses. He is left-handed, but he often starts matches playing right-handed. Though often playing Singles 2 or 3, he begins to take Singles 1 by the end of the Kantou tournament, with the fate of the team's overall success riding on his game; the pressure often seems to be helpful towards his performance, bringing out the best in him — depending on the skill level of the opponent. His bored and cocky demeanor masks his underlying affection and respect for his teammates, especially his close friend Momoshiro and team captain Tezuka. By the time of \"The Prince of Tennis II\", all of middle schoolers are shown to have developed great respect for Ryoma to the point where even some of the best high schoolers at the U-17 camp find him impressive. However, Ryoma ultimately ends up getting kicked out of the U-17 camp after interfering with a match to protect a friend. This expulsion is rescinded, however, but not before Ryoma joins the All-American representative team instead.\nIn \"The Prince of Tennis\" live-action film, Ryoma was portrayed by Kanata Hongo. In the musicals, Echizen has been portrayed by actors Kotaro Yanagi (2003–2006), Yuya Endo (2004–2005), Dori Sakurada (2006–2007), Shogo Sakamoto (2007–2009), Ryuki Takahashi (2008–2010), Yuki Ogoe (2010–2014), Kazuki Furuta (2015–2016), Nichika Akutsu (2016-2020) and currently Hikaru Imamaki (2020-).\nKunimitsu Tezuka.\nTezuka is the national-level captain of the Seigaku tennis team. Like Ryoma, he is an all-rounder, and his special shots include the \"Tezuka Zone,\" which uses his exceptional racket control to put spin on the ball to allow all shots to return to Tezuka no matter where the opponent tries to hit, and the \"Zero-Shiki (Degree) Drop Shot\", which is a drop shot with heavy backspin that can make the ball roll towards the net rather than bounce towards the opposing player. He was later able to adapt his drop Shot into a serve.\nTezuka is noted for being rather distant during practices and never smiling. However, he truly cares about his team and always tries to help them improve. At the nationals match against Sanada of Rikkaidai, Tezuka uses another special technique opposite to \"Tezuka Zone\" called \"Tezuka Phantom\" which forces the ball out of the cour, but the side effect injures his left arm.\nAt the end of \"The Prince of Tennis II\" Chapter 37, Tezuka is noted to have unlocked the last door of \"Muga No Kyouchi\" and has stepped off the training camp to become a Pro in Germany, where he receives tutelage under the 17-year old pro player Volk, and subsequently joins the All-German Representatives. During exhibition match against Japan, he teamed up with Q.P and decimated Atobe Keigo and Kirei Kanata pair in a 6-0 match.\nIn \"The Prince of Tennis\" live-action film, Tezuka was portrayed by Yu Shirota. In \"\", Tezuka has been portrayed by actors Eiji Takigawa (2003–2005), Kengo Ohkuchi, who stood as Tezuka in the place of Eiji Takigawa in the More Than Limit St. Rudolph Gakuen musical, Yu Shirota (2005–2006), Keisuke Minami (2006–2007), Daisuke Watanabe (2007–2009), Baba Ryoma (2008–2010), Takuma Wada (2010–2012), Hideya Tawada (2012–2014), Takuma Zaiki (2015–2016), Yuya Uno (2016-2018), Ryo Aoki (2018-2020), and Kento Yamada (2020-).\nTezuka is the captain of the Seigaku tennis team and its number one player, and has an unbeaten tennis record. The word \"stoic\" doesn't even begin to describe him. He doesn't smile, doesn't laugh, and has a very no-nonsense type of personality.\nLater on, it comes out that Tezuka is indeed a very passionate person who will never surrender in his pursuit of his ideals. What are they? Why, the success of his tennis team. His determination and stubbornness are nearly unmatched. He will lead through example if it kills him - or forever destroys his ability to play.\nTezuka is aloof from his teammates but highly regarded. He is a good student (he has been known to correct the teachers and terrify them while doing so simply through his presence), president of the student council, and is popular.\nHis catch phrase, \"let's not be careless!\" was painfully learned in his first year. As a new player, he was stronger than his seniors, and tried not to embarrass them by playing with his right hand (he is left-handed). However, this was discovered and an enraged senpai struck him in the left arm. This injury comes back to haunt him, and eventually causes him to leave for Germany for treatment.\nTezuka's goal is to become the \"pillar of Seigaku.\" He was challenged by the captain in his first year to become the \"pillar\" the team could rely on. This is how he eventually ruins his arm - he plays past the point of reason to exist as an example to his teammates.\nShuichiro Oishi.\n is the vice-captain of the club. Oishi and Kikumaru Eiji make up Seigaku's national level doubles team, known as the \"Golden Pair\". Oishi is known as the 'Mother Hen of Seigaku', because he constantly worries and frets for the team's well-being. He remains calm and rational in a match, allowing him to form strategies quickly. He uses the Moon Volley, a topspin lob that travels very high over the court and lands just in bounds. He can also use the \"Drop Volley\", a feint hit with the power of a drop shot, making the trajectory much closer to the net. He is portrayed by Hiroki Suzuki in the live-action film.\nHe and Eiji often use the \"Australian Formation\", where they stand directly on the center line to confuse the opponents as to which way each player will move when the ball is placed into the opposing court. The \"I-Formation\" is a variation where Eiji stays below the net and Oishi serves the ball down the center. They also develop \"Oishi Territory\", which has Oishi focus on the net while Eiji stays in the back. It takes advantage of Oishi's ability to read the opponent while passing information to Eiji in the back. They later develop the \"Synchronization\" ability, which lets them play and move as if they are one person.\nDespite his worrywart nature, Oishi is actually an extremely strict and disciplined leader, and a brilliant tactician on the court. His competitive nature is a stark contrast to his more timid public personality. He seems to easily become embarrassed as Kaido, but is also seen practicing proper etiquette more so than anyone else in the series because of his consideration for others.\nOishi plays the mother in the tenipuri episodes. Inui is her husband; Ryoma Echizen, Kaoru Kaido, and Takeshi Momoshiro (Momoko) are her children.\nIn \"The Prince of Tennis II\", Oishi earns the No. 16 badge for the U-17 first string. He is also one of the 14 middle schoolers to represent Japan at the U-17 world cup. Despite the fact that he's not the captain of the middle school representatives, Oishi represents the Japanese U-17 team as a whole on the world stage, drawing lottery slots to determine the team's initial positions for the tournament.\nIn \"Musical: The Prince of Tennis\", Oishi has been portrayed by Yuichi Tsuchiya (2003–2005), Hiroki Suzuki (2005–2006), Yukihiro Takiguchi (2006–2007), Yuya Toyoda (2007–2009), Yuki Tsujimoto (2008–2010), Jin Hiramaki (2010–2012), Ikkei Yamamoto (2012–2014), Shun Ishida (2015–2016), Yu Matsumura (2016-2018), Takanori Ezoe (2018-2020), and Takakazu Hara (2021-).\nShusuke Fuji.\n is a third year student at Seishun Academy. The middle child of three, he has an older sister, Yumiko, who is very attractive and admired by his friends; his younger brother is Yuta, who was a student at Seigaku, but transferred to St. Rudolph. Fuji is a leap year baby, only getting to properly celebrate his birthday properly every 4 years. He is given the title \"tensai\", or genius, due to his tactical skill on the tennis court. Fuji's most famous moves are known as the Triple Counters: Higuma Ootoshi (\"Bear Drop\") for returning smashes; Tsubame Gaeshi (\"Swallow Return\") which runs on the ground without bouncing, effective against players at the baseline; and Hakugei (\"White Whale\"), a shot that uses the wind to hop straight into the air and return to Fuji on the bounce, effective against players at the net. During the nationals, he creates more effective versions of his Triple Counters; three more original counters to deal with complex spin shots, low spin shots, and net balls; and even masters how to play with his eyes closed. In addition, Fuji has an underhand serve that seems to disappear when the opponent is about to hit it. A running gag in the series is that Fuji has interest in or else near-immunity to strange foods and drinks that others would find revolting to the point of fainting. Should he ever pass out from consuming any of the strange concoctions Inui or other data tennis characters come up with, the item in question is deemed a true terror.\nHe is generally very relaxed and in control, often seen with a calm and content expression on his face with his eyes seemingly closed from lightly smiling, and rarely plays at full power. He only seems to do so when he witnesses some form of injustice or wins on the behalf of others who placed their personal health at risk playing tennis. For this reason, data-driven players like Inui and Mizuki cannot predict his movements at all. Fuji later admits to Tezuka that this is due to the fact that he has zero motivation to win, at least prior to the Nationals. There are a few people that can \"wake\" the true player in Fuji and force him to play seriously, and these few are either nationally ranked or extremely talented tennis players. Seigaku teammates Kunimitsu Tezuka and Ryoma Echizen, Shitenhōji captain Kuranosuke Shiraishi, Hyotei Gakuen Chuto Bu regular Yushi Oshitari and Rikkaidai Fuzoku regular Akaya Kirihara have been acknowledged by Fuji to be actual challenges. When he is excited, provoked, or serious, Fuji reveals his sharp eyes: light brown in the manga and blue in the anime.\nIn \"The Prince of Tennis II\", Fuji laments over how he longer has Tezuka to help drive him to keep improving at tennis after the latter leaves for Germany. Fuji recreates his tennis to be more offensive (as opposed to his more defensive, passive approach of past matches) in order to be more competitive at the U-17 world cup, at which he is one of the 14 middle schoolers representing Japan. His first new counter, Hollyhock Blizzard, reflects this by replacing the Higuma Ootoshi (which is functionally a lob) altogether, as this new counter returns opponents' smashes with a smash of his own.\nFuji is one of the few male characters in the anime who is voiced by a female voice actor, others being Ryoma Echizen, Kintarou Tooyama of Shitenhouji, Taichi Dan of Yamabuki, Youhei and Kouhei Tanaka of Jyosei Shonan (the latter two being anime only characters), and Seiichi Yukimura of Rikkaidai Fuzoku. However, Ryoma, Kintarō and Taichi are first years, thus younger and more naturally voiced by a voice actress. Despite Fuji and Yukimura being third years, they are also voiced by voice actresses.\nIn the anime series, Fuji's voice actress is Yuki Kaida who also voices Fuji's sister, Yumiko. For the live-action adaptation film of \"The Prince of Tennis\", Tenimyu actor Hiroki Aiba portrays Fuji.\nIn \"\", Fuji has been portrayed by actors Kimeru (2003–2005), Takashi Nagayama, who stood in during \"Remarkable 1st Match Fudomine\" due to a cast change, Hiroki Aiba (2005–2007, 2008), Yūta Furukawa (2007–2009), Taito Hashimoto (2008–2010), Ryo Mitsuya (2010–2012), Yusuke Yata (2012–2014), Yuki Kamisato (2015–2016), Fuma Sadamoto (2016-2018), Ibu Minaki (2018-2020), and Haruki Mochida (2021-).\nSadaharu Inui.\n is a highly intelligent player, who uses Data Tennis. He constantly collects and analyzes data of other players in order to predict where they hit to next and how. While he collects data pertaining to tennis, he also collects personal pieces of data, such as favorite things, personal habits, and where they have been. This, combined with his almost robotic analytical nature the fact that his eyes are rarely seen (appearing only once at the end of Chapter 211), creating no shortage of awkwardness in social situations outside the court. His style originates from his close friend, Renji of Rikkai, who played doubles with Inui before moving. He is temporarily removed from the regulars after losing to Ryoma and Kaido, and he becomes the team manager. He uses his data to create exercise programs for the team and creates a series of disgusting \"Inui Juice\" health drinks that are able to knock a person out or send them running to the restrooms, which motivates the team to train harder as the drinks are used as punishments. The negative effects of the drinks are resisted by a few, namely Fuji. He is portrayed by Hirofumi Araki in \"The Prince of Tennis\" live-action film.\nInui's data tennis allows him to predict the probability of a shot taking place although other factors can disrupt the probability. Though he relies on data, he still trains excessively to keep up with his teammates, taking on a training load 2.25x more than Kaido's, which is already 3x ahead of the rest of the team. This allows him to reclaim his spot as a regular by beating Momoshiro. He pairs with Kaido in doubles to help Kaido train, and Kaido's massive amount of stamina is used to let him play alone while Inui gathers data. Though Inui is good at predicting his opponent's movements, he can still be defeated by those who either have never shown him all of their techniques or simply surpass him on the physical level. He also has one of the fastest serves in the series. His Sonic Serve can reach 192 km/h (120 mph), though it would later be replaced by the Waterfall Serve. Its arc and descent resembles that of a waterfall engulfing the opponent, and can reach 212 km/h (~132 mph).\nIn \"The Prince of Tennis II\", he helps Renji take the No. 17 spot on the U-17 first string. He and Renji both later join the intel support team for the All-Japan Representatives.\nIn the musicals, Inui has been portrayed by Sota Aoyama (2003–2005), Hirofumi Araki (2005–2006), Masei Nakayama (2006–2007), Yuuta Takahashi (2007–2009), Yusuke Arai (2008–2010), Teruma (2010–2012), Seiya Inagaki (2012–2014), and Ryosei Tanaka (2015–2016), Sho Kato (2016-2018), Daisuke Takenouchi (2018-2020), and Ichigo Shiota (2021-).\nEiji Kikumaru.\n is part of Seigaku's \"Golden Pair\" along with Oishi. Even so, he sometimes does doubles with Fuji and they are then called the \"Dream Pair\". Eiji uses \"Acrobatic Play\" which takes advantage of his flexible body. Eiji is also known to have the sharpest vision on the team with an exceptional talent for seeing moving objects. His main weakness is his lack of stamina which he finally overcomes through hard work and training later in the series. Though the Golden Pair seldom play without each other, certain circumstances, such as their temporary breakup when Oishi gives his spot to Ryoma, forces him to play in singles. Eiji is a friendly, sweet-tempered, and outgoing character and the youngest of a large family. He is portrayed by Osamu Adachi in the live-action film.\nEiji's flexible body allows him to reach balls with a touch of flair that few can replicate. His dives and flips often astonish the spectators and often gets grudging praise from his opponents helping Eiji focus. He focuses on the net with his \"Kikumaru Beam\", a sharp volley that is hit with his hand reaching around his back, and his \"Kikumaru Bazooka\", a smash hit upside-down. While playing doubles, Eiji follows the lead of Oishi. The two rely on and know each other thoroughly, which allows them to predict each other's moves without any signals. They further develop this by achieving \"Synchronization\", letting them act together as if they were only one person. He can also play well in singles by using his \"Seal Step\", which uses his speed to move from one location to a new one the moment the opponents eyes leave his first location. This gives the opponent the impression that there are two of him for a doppelganger type effect, though the anime gives him the ability to hug and high five his after image, making it slightly unrealistic.\nEiji's favorite color is red; he enjoys brushing his teeth, wandering around pet shops, omelette rice, fried shrimp, and shaved ice. He was born November 28 at 6:28 am and is a Sagittarius. He has grandparents, a mother, a father, two older sisters, and two older brothers, and therefore is the youngest of a very large family, something that gives him attributes of being fun-loving and easy-going. His father is a news reporter. His favorite subject is Japanese history. He has declared that he might want to become a stunt double in the future with Oishi being his personal trainer, doctor, and still best friend. His favorite date spot is the amusement park; he loves anime/fantasy, idol magazines, and JPOP. He also looks for someone who is cheerful and someone whom he can share a laugh with in a friend. He most wants a new knitted hat. Outside of tennis, he excels in fly swatting, bug collecting, cooking, and can often be found in the gymnasium when not at the tennis courts.\nIn the Tenipuri Family episodes, Eiji plays the family's pet, a pink cat named Kikumaru.\nIn the musicals, Eiji has been portrayed by Yamazaki Ichitaro (2003–2004), Takashi Nagayama (2003–2005), Adachi Osamu (2005–2006), Koji Seto (2006–2007), Kyousuke Hamao (2007–2009), Takasaki Shouta (2008–2010), Koseki Yuta (2010–2012), Mario Kuroba (2012–2014), and Honda Reo (2015–2016), Seiichiro Nagata (2016-2018), Tsukasa Taguchi (2018-2020), and Sosho Tomimoto (2021-).\nTakeshi Momoshiro.\n is known as Seigaku's \"number one rascal.\" As the player who is the most open and friendly with everyone, Momoshiro is connected to everyone on the team on some level. Momoshiro is the closest to a true friend Ryoma Echizen can claim; the two spend much time together eating hamburgers or playing street tennis. Momoshiro and Kaido Kaoru are eternal rivals, and constantly try to out-do each other. This makes them efficient as a doubles pair, because the two rivals know each other so well. Momoshiro develops an affinity for playing doubles and even masters it, despite expressing a preference for singles. He loses his position as a regular after losing to Inui in the ranking matches. When Oishi injures his wrist before the match against Hyotei, Momoshiro takes his place to form a makeshift Golden Pair with Kikumaru. After that, he keeps his regular spot when Tezuka leaves for rehabilitation. He becomes the Vice-captain of Seigaku the following year. He is portrayed by Masaki Kaji in \"The Prince of Tennis\" live-action film.\nMomoshiro's signature move is the Dunk Smash, a very powerful smash performed as he jumps several feet into the air. His catchphrase is \"Don\", which he often says upon hitting a winner. He later develops the Jack Knife, a pro-level powerful backhand. In the anime, he develops the Super Dunk, a Dunk Smash that spins for a long time on the court before bouncing, thus confusing the opponent as to when it will bounce up. Momoshiro is good at \"faking out\" his opponents and is just as excellent of a tactician as Oishi on the court. His ability to read the opponent's movements and to observe their viewpoints and expression allows Momoshiro to guess where the ball will go and use techniques that will confuse his opponents. He later improves upon this ability by training in the mountains, allowing him to be more in tune with nature to the point where he can even read and predict weather patterns.\nIn \"The Prince of Tennis II\", his wrists suffer severe damage after being on the receiving end of a Black Jack Knife, which has twice the spin and power of his regular Jack Knife. However, he later learns the Black Jack Knife himself, and uses it to take the No. 19 position on the U-17 first string.\nIn the musicals, Momoshiro has been portrayed by Eiji Moriyama (2003–2005), Masaki Kaji (2005–2006), Shinpei Takagi (2006–2007), Tetsuya Makita (2007–2009), Toshihiro Nobuyama (2008–2010), Toru Kamitsuru (2010–2012), Mashu Ishiwatari (2012–2014), Shuto Mashima (2015–2016), Shunsaku Yoshimura (2016-2018), Tatsuki Ōkubo (2018-2020), and Shun Hojuyama (2020-).\nTakashi Kawamura.\n has a shy personality without his tennis racket, but he becomes extremely aggressive and loud once he holds a tennis racket, referred to as Burning Mode. He often shouts various English words like \"Burning!\", \"Great!\", \"Come on, baby!\", \"Shocking!\", \"Victory!\", and \"Delicious!\" while in Burning Mode. During his first year, he had a lot of power, but lacked control to the point where most of his shots were outside the court fences. He was made fun of by his peers, but his close friends stayed by him and helped him develop his control. During his third year, he became a regular and eventually meets his goal of becoming the number one power player in Japan by beating Gin Ishida. He plans to quit playing tennis after the tournament and focus on working as a sushi chef under his father with the goal of being number one in the future. He is portrayed by Yoshikazu Kotani in \"The Prince of Tennis\" live-action film.\nKawamura mainly relies on the , a very powerful maneuver that uses 120% of an arm's strength, but puts a lot of strain on his arm. He copies it from Fudomine's Tetsu Ishida, who learned it from his brother, Gin. Kawamura lowers the risk of the shot by using a , which decreases the power. He can use either while jumping to make the , which is hard to return. He later develops the , which is a regular Hadoukyuu performed during an extremely fast dash. It strengthens the shot by focusing all the momentum on the wrist, but it can break the wrist if overused. During his match against Gin, he develops a \"Final Hadoukyuu\" that, because he accidentally hit with racket frame instead of the gut, the ball vibrates, and thus has power far exceeding Gin's strongest Hadoukyuu, breaking the latter's wrist.\nHe also reappears as a candidate in the U-17 selection camp, where he loses to Jin Akutsu, but comes back to take the No. 12 position in the first string.\nIn the musicals, Kawamura has been portrayed by Yoshitsugu Abe (2003–2005), Eiki Kitamura, who stood in for Abe in the More than St. Rudolph Gakuen Musical, Yoshikazu Kotani (2005–2006), Kouji Watanabe (2006–2007), Hiroaki Ogasawara (2007–2009, eventually replaced by Gong Teyu), Ikkou Chou (2008–2010), Sora Yaguchi (previously known as Tomohiro Tsurumi) (2010–2012), Shohei (2012–2014), Kodai Takikawa (2015–2016), Masaya Suzuki (2016-2018), Tomoki Iwata (2018-2020), and Kai Otomo (2021-).\nKaoru Kaido.\n (sometimes spelled Kaidou) is known as \"Viper\" to his teammates for constantly making a \"fshuuuu\" sound similar to a snake while exhaling. Kaido trains rigorously, increasing the training program given to him by Inui to give him an abnormally high stamina, even against other characters who boast to have high stamina. He has a deep rivalry with Momoshiro, in which they constantly try to beat each other. Because they are rivals, they also know each other the best, and they can get along very well in times of need; this makes them an efficient doubles pair. He normally plays singles, though he eventually pairs with Inui, who helps Kaido train and develop new techniques. Kaido's stamina is used to let him play the other team alone, while Inui collects data. After the national tournament, Kaido becomes the new captain of Seigaku. He is portrayed by Kousuke Kujirai in the live-action \"The Prince of Tennis\" film.\nHis signature move is the Snake Shot, derived from the \"Buggy Whip Shot\", which is a curving forehand that keeps his opponents running. He later develops the Boomerang Snake, where the ball swerves around the net pole back in bounds. He develops the shot under Inui's advice and by working with him in doubles. He also develops the Short Snake, which goes directly behind the net player, the Reverse Snake, which is used to keep opponents guessing, and the Tornado Snake, which is a fast straight shot with a spin that cuts air resistance. He can also use Hiroshi Yagyu's \"Laser Beam\", calling his version the Gyro Laser, which is an extremely fast shot with the same spin as the Tornado Snake, allowing him to confuse opponents. He also develops the Hadoukyuu Boomerang in the anime, which is developed from the Hadoukyuu that has much more strength behind a regular Boomerang shot.\nAlthough he has a tough exterior and is cold towards others, there is a softer side to Kaido. Unknown to many, Kaidou enjoys playing with small animals. He is often seen playing (or at least trying to play) with Ryoma's cat, Karupin, who wanders off on his own most of the time. Koharu notes that Kaido was often mistaken for a girl back in Kindergarten and was sometimes forced to wear a skirt, crying a lot as a result, implying that Kaido's tough demeanor is merely a front to hide his insecurities. This hidden vulnerability often puts Kaidou in many comedic situations as he tends to take himself way too seriously compared to his peers.\nIn the various TeniPuri Family episodes, Kaido is the young infant. Not being able to speak, he mainly just says \"fssshhuuuu\". Shuuko (Oishi) introduced infant – Kaido as \"cutie-pie, Kaoru-chan\". He is often bullied in some sorts by his older siblings, Ryoma and Momoko (Momoshiro).\nIn the musicals, Kaido has been portrayed by Naoya Gomoto (2003–2005), Kousuke Kujirai (2005–2006), Tomo Yanagishita (2006–2008), Yuuichirou Hirata (2007–2009), Akihiro Hayashi (2008–2010), Ryosuke Ikeoka (2010–2012), (2012–2014), Hiroki Sana (2015–2016), Hikaru Makishima (2016-2018), Takuto Nakajima (2018-2020), and Yuga Iwasaki (2021-).\nSumire Ryuzaki.\n is the coach of Seigaku's tennis club and one of the school's math teachers. She helped Nanjiro Echizen develop his skills and become a professional tennis player. Her granddaughter Sakuno has a crush on Ryoma. Ryuzaki has a rivalry with her ex-mentor Mikiya Banda, a.k.a. Banji, who is the coach for Yamabuki. She constantly yells, but she is considered to be a great and reliable coach. She has a good relationship with her regulars and participates in their recreational group activities: the bowling reunion and the beach-volley mini-tournament with Rokkaku Middle School. For the \"Prince of Tennis\" live-action film, Ryuzaki's whole personality and back story was changed: she also had Ryoma's father in her tennis team a couple of years ago, and instead of being a middle-aged teacher and ex-coach to Nanjiro Echizen, she is portrayed as a young and more cheerful woman as well as a former classmate of Nanjiro's, who was her reason for playing tennis and becoming the coach. She is portrayed by the popular singer Hitomi Shimatani in the live-action film.\nOpponents.\nFudomine.\n is an unseeded and unknown public school with rumors of violence. It was originally unknown due to an unreasonable coach and a lazy set of senior regulars. The freshmen at Fudoumine were brutalized severely by the older tennis club members, while the coach ignored the mistreatment. Tachibana and the abused freshman attempted to rally together and form their own tennis club, but the coach and the other players find this idea absurd and try to stop this from happening. When the coach allows his older team members to attack Tachibana and the freshman, Tachibana snaps and attacks the coach. As a result, Fudoumine is pulled out of the District Matches that year. Tachibana and the others eventually reform the club, and in the series, upsets Kakinoki in the District Tournament semi-finals and Hyotei in the Prefectural quarterfinals. They go on to make it all the way to the quarterfinals of the Nationals before losing to Shitenhouji. Fudomine's uniforms are black hooded jackets with the Fudomine logo, black shirts, white shorts, and black warm-up pants.\nSt. Rudolph.\n is a team that first appears in the Tokyo Metropolitan Matches arc and faces Seigaku in the quarterfinals. The school itself only recruits students who are gifted at tennis and they only practice together once a week. The team uniform is a white shirt with brown, brown shorts, and brown warm-up pants.\nYamabuki.\n is a national caliber team that bases their strategy on two National caliber doubles teams, supported by the National caliber Singles player Sengoku. They try to use those three weapons to defeat opponents before the matches get drawn out. When their strategy was foiled in the previous year by Seigaku's Tezuka defeating Sengoku, they recruited a second dominant singles player Jin Akutsu, with the aim to eliminate that weakness. Yamabuki's regular sports uniforms are green jackets with yellow stripes with hoods, shirts of the same design, white shorts, and green warm-up pants.\nHyoutei Academy.\n is a team that uses a strict stratification and merit system, which prioritizes ability over emotion. If any regular loses a match, they are removed from their spot and only given a second chance in very rare conditions. With Keigo Atobe as their leader, the one who revolutionized the merit system on the team. Hyoutei's tennis club is composed of over two hundred members, far larger than any other tennis club in the series, which is likely the reason why they use a strict merit system for their regulars in the first place. Widely considered as the main contenders to Rikkai Dai, they instead suffered setbacks in the early tournaments, losing to Fudomine in the quarterfinals of the Prefectural Tournament, and then losing to Seigaku in the first round of the Kanto tournament, leaving them ineligible for the National tournament. They are all depressed until they receive a special invite due to the host city, Tokyo, getting to invite one extra team. According to Takeshi Konomi, Hyoutei's popularity was much higher than he expected, and it was for that reason that he chose to bring them back into the story. The Hyoutei team is one of the most popular teams in the entire series. In the official school popularity poll, they came in second losing only to Seigaku.\nJosei Shonan.\n resides in the Kanagawa Prefecture of the Tokyo region. Though they are mentioned in the manga, they only appear in the anime, where they replace Midoriyama as Seigaku's opponents in the second round of the Kantō Tournament.\nRokkaku.\n is a team based in the Chiba Prefecture, which focuses on training local children in tennis from an early age. They have a large playground and tennis court which is often used to train. They make the Kantō Tournament semi-finals, where they lose to Seigaku. They advance to the National Tournament, but they are upset by a dark horse team, Higa.\nRikkaidai.\n is located in the Kanagawa prefecture and is considered to be the best middle school team, having won the Japanese National tournament the last two years. They aim for perfect wins in the matches winning the Nationals for the third year. They are fully introduced during the Kantō Tournament, where they easily crush Fudomine in the semi-finals. In the finals, however, they suffer a loss to Seigaku, and return to the Nationals to try to beat Seigaku to fulfill their 3rd win in the Nationals. They make their way all the way through to the finals of the Nationals, but they are once again defeated by Seigaku, ending their hopes of winning a third straight title. Takeshi Konomi mentioned in an interview that he was not sure who would be in the finals between Nagoya Seitoku and Rikkadai, but he decided on Rikkaidai finding them were more interesting.\nShitenhoji.\n is one of the strongest teams in the Kansai region. Though the team loses to Rikkai in previous year's semi-finals, the members puts up the strongest fight against Rikkai with more willpower than any other team's. During the course of the series, they defeat Fudomine in the National Quarterfinals, but once again lose in the semi-finals, this time to Seigaku.\nHiga.\n is the first team from the Okinawa Prefecture to make it past the Kyūshū tournament in twenty-six years. All its players are Okinawan martial artists, and incorporate their experience in their tennis style, such as with the \"Shukuchihou\" method of movement. They have poor sportsmanship, and are not afraid to use nasty methods in order to win. During the series, the team makes the Nationals for the first time, and defeat Rokkaku in the first round. However, they are defeated in straight sets by Seigaku in the second round.\nAmerican Team (anime).\nThe American Team was part of the \"Senbatsu Training Camp\" and \"Good Will Games\" arc only seen in the anime of \"The Prince of Tennis\".\nHigh School Team.\nThe high school team debuted in \"The Prince of Tennis II\" as members of the elite U-17 tennis camp for the All-Japan team. These high schoolers are noted as the top youth tennis players in Japan. Entry into the camp is only possible through invitation, and 50 middle schoolers from Prince of Tennis were invited to further develop their skills. The first string (composed of the top 20 members out of the 250 member pool, now 300 after the middle schoolers joined) regularly travels abroad to compete against other high school teams from other countries (also composed of the best of those countries). A vast majority of the high schoolers on the second string are extremely arrogant, looking down on the middle schoolers the moment they walked in the gates. However, the same majority quickly proved to be inferior to the middle schoolers in terms of skill.\nForeign Teams.\nThe following characters debuted in \"The Prince of Tennis II\", belonging to U-17 teams from outside of Japan that have gathered for the U-17 World Cup. The rankings listed are the most recent, with Japan at No. 23. Each of the 32 countries participating can bring up to 14 high school (Youth division) and 14 middle school (Jr. Youth division) players to the competition. To represent a country, a player only needs to have an address of residence in said country, highlighting the philosophy that tennis should not have any national boundaries.\nGerman Team.\nRanked No. 1 in the world, the German Team's level of skill far surpasses that of their nearest competitor, Switzerland. They have won the U-17 World Cup nine times consecutively prior to the series' start. Tezuka joins this team after leaving Japan as a part of his pre-requisites to going pro. The U-17 German team is notable for having three pro-level players on their team for this year's World Cup despite the age restriction of 17 and under.\nSwiss Team.\nRanked No. 2 in the world, the Swiss Team is considered Germany's closest rival and is the only other team to have a pro-level player among their ranks.\nFrench Team.\nRanked No. 3 in the world, the French Team was also home to Duke Watanabe before he joined the Japanese Team.\nSpanish Team.\nRanked No. 4 in the world, the Spanish Team is the last of the Big 4. Any country ranking beneath Spain are volatile in their position and constantly subject to change.\nAmerican Team.\nCurrently ranked No. 5 in the world, Ryoma joins this team on Ryoga's invitation following his expulsion from camp. This team bears no association with the team from the Goodwill games in the anime arc or even mentions them. The team hopes to finally break into the Big 4 hierarchy this year. Oddly enough, no middle school representatives have been shown for this team, and Ryoma occupies the 14th slot of the high school representatives.\nEnglish Team.\nRanked No. 7 in the world, the members of this team are mostly Atobe's former grade school classmates.\nGreek Team.\nRanked No. 10 in the world, some members of this team greatly resemble the iconic real-world statues of characters from Greek myth and culture. Their coach, for example, resembles The Thinker by Auguste Rodin.\nAustralian Team.\nRanked No. 18 in the world, this is the home team of this year's world cup.\nTube Republic Team.\nRanked No. 32 in the world, this fictional country gained its independence from an unspecified nation just 30 years ago. The team members speak in a fictional language. Only two high schoolers have been shown, with the rest of their team nowhere in sight. Other than Japan, Tube is the only other country in the tournament whose world rank has improved as drastically following the pre-World Cup."

It was founded on August 10, 1854 in what is now the northwest section of the city, and is the nation's second oldest cricket club. Its clubhouse was designed by architects McKim, Mead &amp; White. The U.S. National tennis championship, precursor to today's US Open, was played on Germantown Cricket's lawn tennis courts from 1921 to 1923.\nThe Germantown Cricket Club was located in Nicetown from 1877 until 1890 when it moved to its present Manheim Street location after merging with the Young America Cricket Club in 1890. The Newhall brothers joined the Germantown cricket team at this time after being the backbone of the Young America Cricket Club for forty years.\nIt continues as a private club with facilities for tennis, squash, swimming, and special events.

It is played using two teams of five players on a full-length basketball court, and a roster of eight different fictional teams.\nGameplay.\nThere are four modes of gameplay. One-player, which pits the player in a solo match against a computer opponent. Two-player, which is a co-op match against a computer opponent. Versus, which is a two player mode that pits the players against each other. And finally, Watch, which allows the player to watch a computer-controlled match. \nThe court is displayed in a vertical fashion, from a top-down perspective, revealing only half of the court at a time. If the ball travels past the half-court line, the screen goes black temporarily and changes over to the other half of the court (which looks identical, save for the color of the floorboards). This is done to alert the player that they have travelled to a different side of the court. When a player attempts a slam dunk, gameplay will pause and cut to a detailed animation of the maneuver.\nReception.\nStan Stepanic of Game Freaks 365 rated this as the second best basketball title on the NES, citing reasons such as its innovative usage of a vertically scrolling court and a well-programmed, computer-AI defense. His score in its gameplay category was nearly a perfect 10. He states: \"It's definitely worth a look for even the casual NES gamer, and I assure you if you take the time to learn it's intricacies, you'll be happy in the end\"."

        "text": "The 34th Ryder Cup was held 27–29 September 2002 in England, on the Brabazon Course at The Belfry in Wishaw, Warwickshire (near Sutton Coldfield).\nThe European team won the competition by a margin of 15 to 12, the largest margin of victory in the Ryder Cup since the European team won 16 to 11 in 1985, also played at The Belfry. Both teams were tied at 8 points going into the Sunday singles matches. Sam Torrance had put most of his best players out early while Curtis Strange had opted to do the opposite. Momentum swung for Europe and after Phillip Price defeated Phil Mickelson 3 &amp; 2, Europe needed point for victory. The decisive point was secured by Paul McGinley in his match against Jim Furyk after he holed a 10-foot par putt on the 18th hole.\nThe victory prompted Tony Blair, then British Prime Minister to joke in his speech at the following week's Labour Party conference: \"What about the Ryder Cup, eh? Britain in Europe at its best. Me and George Bush on opposite sides\".\nThe event was originally scheduled for 28–30 September 2001 but was postponed for a year on 16 September following the September 11 attacks. \"The PGA of America has informed the European Ryder Cup Board that the scope of the last Tuesday's tragedy is so overwhelming that it would not be possible for the United States Ryder Cup team and officials to attend the match this month.\" The manager of Phil Mickelson and Mark Calcavecchia had earlier announced that the two players would not travel to Europe. Other American players were said to be concerned about attending the event. It was agreed that the same captains and players would participate in the 2002 event.\nIt was later decided to thereafter play matches in even-numbered years instead of odd-numbered, shifting the already-scheduled 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 editions to 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively. This in turn caused a corresponding change in schedules for the Presidents Cup, Solheim Cup, and Seve Trophy (all of which are played in years the Ryder Cup is not played). The Presidents Cup was in turn delayed by a year, while both the Solheim Cup and Seve Trophy played their 2002 matches as scheduled then subsequently started playing in odd-numbered years in 2003. The Junior Ryder Cup, which was also scheduled for 2001, was rescheduled for 2002. In a case of anachronism, the display boards at The Belfry still read \"The 2001 Ryder Cup\", and U.S. captain Curtis Strange deliberately referred to his team as \"The 2001 Ryder Cup Team\" in his speech at the closing ceremony. 18 years later, these changes would be reverted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which postponed the 2020 Ryder Cup to 2021.\nThis was the second of seven consecutive victories at home by Europe, a streak that remains intact through 2023.\nTelevision.\nDomestic television coverage was provided by BBC and Sky Sports.\nIn the United States, coverage of the first day was presented on tape-delay by USA Network, but was recorded live. Bill Macatee and Peter Kostis hosted from the 18th tower. On the weekend, NBC Sports presented Saturday's coverage on tape, but recorded live. NBC aired the singles live on Sunday. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosted from the 18th tower, Bob Murphy called holes, while on-course reporters were Gary Koch, Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Ed Sneed. To provide a European perspective, NBC used former European team captain Bernard Gallacher and former European team player Nick Faldo as guest analysts. Gallacher had performed the same role for NBC at the previous Ryder Cup in 1999.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format used from 1991 to 2002 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup.

        "title": "Essex Golf &amp; Country Club",
        "text": "Essex Golf &amp; Country Club is a private, 18-hole championship golf course located in LaSalle, Ontario, south of Windsor.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1902 under the name of Oak Ridge Golf Club, and from that date until 1910 played over a 3400 yard nine-hole course on the Farwell Farm in Sandwich. Mr. George Mair, the club's founder, was president.\nIn the fall of 1910 the club purchased the Colonel Alan Prince Farm in the town of Sandwich on Center Road, now Prince Road at its intersection with College Avenue, not far from the Ambassador Bridge linking Windsor and Detroit. The property consisted of of land and a nine-hole golf course was constructed in 1911. During construction, members were invited to play at the Walkerville Country Club, which started out as a tennis club, situated at the present site of Walkerville Collegiate in the Town of Walkerville (now part of Windsor) founded in 1890 by the distiller Hiram Walker. Mr. Hiram W Walker, a nephew of Hiram Walker and Mayor of Walkerville, became a member of Essex in 1914.\nMerger.\nThe Oak Ridge Golf Club merged with the Walkerville Club and the name was changed to the \"Essex County Golf &amp; Country Club.\" The nine-hole course was open for play in the spring of 1912 and was in use until the fall of 1914 when, additional land having been procured, an 18-hole course was built. During 1917 more land was purchased and the course was remodeled under the direction of Detroit golf course professional Ernest Way to make a longer 18-hole course.\nThe growth of the community resulted in the club losing its country club character, and the decision was made to relocate to a more rural setting. In the mid-1920s of wooded farmland was purchased in the Town of LaSalle. (Additional land was acquired along the north and south borders in the 1960s and 1970s to bring the total average to approximately 138 acres). The services of the legendary golf course architect, Donald J. Ross was retained and construction of a course was commenced in 1928. Construction was supervised by John Gray who, like Ross, was a native born Scotsman. Mr. Gray, who had been a greenskeeper at the Prince Road course, remained so at the new course until his death in 1958 at age 73. Gray's advice was sought by many because of his expertise. He was a charter member of the United States National Greenskeepers Association when the organization was formed in Toledo, Ohio in 1926.\nThe new clubhouse was modeled on an English country house and was designed by the Windsor architectural firm of Sheppard, Nichols &amp; Masson. It opened on July 1, 1929. When the Detroit District Golf Association was formed in 1919 by 14 clubs, several of the founding clubs had Ross Courses, among which was Essex. It continued the connection through the years and still belongs to the Golf Association of Michigan as well as the Golf Association of Ontario and the Royal Canadian Golf Association.\nFame.\nIn the early 1930s, the club encountered financial difficulties and sought relief from the courts on interest payments. During the next several years, mutually satisfactory arrangements were made with the bondholders and in 1948 the club obtained a new charter and started to operate as the Essex Golf &amp; Country Club on June 1, 1949.\nFrom its birth, Essex was placed by knowledgeable golfers in the front rank of courses anywhere. This carried a lot of prestige since within a hundred miles are found Oakland Hills, Detroit Golf Club, Country Club of Detroit, Franklin Hills, Meadowbrook, all in the Detroit area and Inverness in Toledo. Very few courses surpass these in interest and character. They have provided enjoyable rounds for the club members and also have stood up to the talents of some of the finest golfers in the world in major championships, both open and amateur. Essex was played regularly by many great players who became club pro's in Detroit, including Walter Hagen, Al Watrous, Horton Smith and others. A frequent visitor in the 1930s was \"Babe\" Didrikson Zaharias, one of the greatest all around athletes of her time.\nIn 1915 Essex admitted Miss Kate Duncan who became the first Lady Member. By 1921, Essex had 10 Lady Members. Miss Duncan remained a member until her death in 1967. Kate Duncan Day was established in her memory.\nAmong its members, Essex has boasted some very accomplished players. Dr. George F. Laing, who was a fine senior player and seven times Essex Club Champion, Nick Weslock, a former Essex caddie who won many amateur tournaments and Rudy Horvath who was a prominent player on the PGA Tour until the 1950s.\nTournaments and Championships.\nAs a tournament site, Essex has provided a strong challenge to some of the top players in the world. It hosted the Ontario Open Championship in 1922, 1949 and 1951, the 1934 Ontario Amateur, the Canadian Women's Amateur in 1964 and, at the top of the list, the Canadian Open in 1976. The latter event was won by Jerry Pate, who established the official competitive course record of 63, shooting 69-67-68-63 = 267 (13 under par), over a field that included Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom Watson, Raymond Floyd, Johnny Miller, Jim Colbert, Tom Weiskopf, Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, Gene Littler, Bruce Lietzke and virtually all of the best tournament players of the day. (Pate's record stood until 2002)\nThe golf world's attention was once again focused on Essex when the club hosted the 1998 du Maurier Classic, the fourth \"Major\" on the LPGA Tour. The $1.2 million (US) tournament was held from July 27 to August 2, a great financial success, recorded as one of the best run du Maurier events ever which broke an all-time attendance record in the 25-year history of the event. The $180,000 (US) first place prize was won by Brandie Burton with an 18 under par 270, one stroke better than Annika Sörenstam. The field included LPGA Hall of Famers Nancy Lopez, Joanne Carner and Beth Daniel as well as the 1998 rookie sensation Se Ri Pak and all of the world's finest LPGA players.\nThe highlight of the centennial year was the hosting of the PGA Senior Tour's 1.6 million AT&amp;T Canada Senior Open Championship, placing the club as one of the only three Canadian golf clubs to have hosted a PGA Tour, LPGA Tour and a Senior PGA Tour event. Tom Jenkins won the tournament over Bruce Lietzke, Morris Hatalsky and Walter Morgan. A new course record was set when sixty-one-year-old Walter Morgan recorded an incredible 11 under par 60 in the second round of the tournament, improving on the 63 shot by Jerry Pate in the 1976 Canadian Open.\nRenovation.\nIn 1998, Essex also undertook a massive renovation project to improve the club's facilities, practice range, parking, course maintenance facility and a total refurbishment of the clubhouse facilities. In 2002, the club's 100th year, Essex embarked on a major kitchen improvement plan, enlarging and equipping the existing facility with the most up-to-date conveniences. In addition, the entire roof of the magnificent structure was replaced. \nDuring 2003, work was completed on a new million-dollar irrigation system. Essex was also privileged to host the Seniors Triangular Matches composed of teams from Canada and the United States and an international team from the British Isles. The fall of 2005 saw the commencement of the Renaissance Plan, a project which included restoring the fairways and greens back to their original Donald Ross design as well as a rebuilding and restoration of the bunkers. The project was completed in the fall of 2006."

        "title": "Baseball in Canada",
        "text": " \nBaseball in Canada is played at various levels throughout the country, including by Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays, founded in 1977 (Canada's first MLB team, the Montreal Expos, formed in 1969, relocated to Washington, D.C. in 2005) and Minor League Baseball's Vancouver Canadians, an affiliate of the Blue Jays competing in the High-A Northwest League. There are also several teams that compete in independent baseball leagues, such as the Trois-Rivières Aigles of the Frontier League and the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the American Association.\nNotable amateur leagues include the Intercounty Baseball League (Ontario), Ligue de Baseball Majeur du Québec (Quebec), and the collegiate Western Canadian Baseball League (Alberta and Saskatchewan). There are additionally amateur-level baseball teams playing in each province in the summer months under the auspices of Baseball Canada. Several American-based collegiate leagues have teams in Canada.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nAdapted from the British game of rounders—and by extension, cricket—the game of base ball or \"townball\" became popular in the early 19th century in Southwestern Ontario (then Canada West or Upper Canada), New York and New England.\nUniversity of Western Ontario professor Bob Barney researched the oldest verified baseball game played in Canada, based on a letter from Dr. Adam E. Ford of Denver, Colorado, formerly of St. Marys, Ontario, and Beachville, Ontario, to the editor of \"Sporting Life\", published on May 5, 1886. In the letter, Ford described in detail a game he witnessed on June 4, 1838—Militia Muster Day, played in Beachville, Ontario. Barney verified the names of participants and descriptions of the field; by researching tax forms, census records, maps, church records, and tombstones, and found that all of the participants and details in Ford's letter were correct.\nThe \"Journal of Sport History\" published Barney's findings in 1988. The Canadian claim to the oldest verified baseball game was subsequently recognized by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Barney opined that following the American Revolution, settlers in Southwestern Ontario brought their recreational activities. Ted Spencer, curator of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and historian Tom Heitz, noted that records exist of earlier bat and ball games played in the United States that evolved into baseball, and agreed that American settlers in Canada likely brought the game with them.\nOriginally, the rules of the game were informal in nature and often modified to reflect regional preferences.\nIn Ontario, a variant of baseball known as \"The Canadian Game\" was most prevalent. It featured five bases, bats that resembled those used in cricket or rounders and eleven players per team. All eleven players went to bat each inning, which would not end until they were all retired.\nThe American variant of baseball had nine players a side instead of eleven, and four bases instead of five. Southwestern Ontario was the first region in Canada to adopt this version of the game, doing so in . The so-called \"Canadian Game\" soon fell out of favour.\nThe London Tecumsehs of London, Ontario, were charter members of the International Association and won its first championship in 1877, beating the Pittsburgh Alleghenies.\nRather than competing nationally in an east–west fashion, local baseball clubs would instead compete with their American neighbours to the south. This meant that teams from the Maritimes played teams from New England, teams from Quebec played against teams from New York and teams from British Columbia competed with those from Washington.\nThe first Canadian to appear in a Major League game was Bill Phillips, who played for Cleveland. In his first game on May 1, 1879, the Saint John, New Brunswick native went hitless, although managed to get three hits the next game. In his second season, in , he became the first Canadian to hit a home run in the Majors.\nBy the 1880s black Canadians were barred from playing in white professional leagues, but Emancipation Day black vs white matches provided an opportunity for black teams to shine, such as when the Northern Stars trounced a white team in Edmonton.\nEarly 20th century.\nBy 1913, there were 24 minor league baseball teams in Canada, a number which has been unequalled since.\nBabe Ruth hit his first professional home run on Canadian soil on September 5, 1914, at the former Hanlan's Point Stadium on Centre Island in Toronto. Ruth was playing for the Providence Grays against the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the International League.\nIn 1985, the City of Toronto erected a small plaque to denote the location, but it is difficult to locate, given the parklike setting and remote nature of the Toronto Islands.\nIn 1946, Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey assigned new-signing Jackie Robinson to the Montreal Royals of the International League, Brooklyn's Triple-A farm team. Robinson would famously go on to break Major League Baseball's colour barrier the following year in 1947, but during his season in Montreal Robinson led the Royals to the Governors' Cup, the IL championship, and became a beloved figure in the city. In Ken Burns' documentary film Baseball, the narrator quotes Sam Maltin, a stringer for the Pittsburgh Courier: \"It was probably the only day in history that a black man ran from a white mob with love instead of lynching on its mind.\"\nFollowing Robinson's breaching of the colour barrier, in the 1950s many other players from the declining Negro leagues travelled north to ply their trade in Canada, including Hall of Famers Leon Day, Satchel Paige and Willie Wells, who like many other African-American players competed in the Mandak League.\nIn 1957, former Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Glen Gorbous, a native of Drumheller, Alberta set the current world record for longest throw of a baseball at in Omaha, Nebraska.\nLate 20th century and beyond.\nThe first Canadian in the National Baseball Hall of Fame was Ferguson Jenkins, a right-handed pitcher who compiled a 284–226 record, 3.34 ERA and 3,192 strikeouts in 19 seasons from 1965 to 1983 with the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, and Boston Red Sox. Jenkins is one of the Black Aces, a group of African American pitchers with at least 20 wins in a single major-league season (although Jenkins is actually a Black Canadian, not African American). In 2020, Larry Walker became the second Canadian inducted into the Hall of Fame. Walker played right field for the Montreal Expos, Colorado Rockies, and St. Louis Cardinals from 1989 to 2005, winning the National League MVP in 1997 with the Rockies.\nThe London Tecumsehs were refused admission to the National League in 1877 because they refused to stop playing exhibition games against local teams. While baseball is widely played in Canada, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian team until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League. The team enjoyed a widespread following until about 1994, when the Expos were in first place in the NL East; after the strike shortened year, a series of poor management decisions, disputes with the city, and neglect by the ownership caused the Expos to be routinely last in MLB attendance.\nIn 1977, the Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. They later became the first Canadian-based team to win the World Series, winning back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993.\nIn 1993, besides the two Canadian major league clubs, Canada hosted four Triple-A teams (the Calgary Cannons, Edmonton Trappers, Ottawa Lynx and Vancouver Canadians), one Double-A team (the London Tigers), two Class A Short Season teams (the St. Catharines Blue Jays and Welland Pirates) and two rookie-level teams (the Lethbridge Mounties and Medicine Hat Blue Jays).\nIn 2003 an attempt to create the Canadian Baseball League was launched, but the league folded halfway through its first season.\nIn 2004, the Expos, then owned by MLB itself, moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals, leaving the Toronto Blue Jays as the only remaining Canadian MLB team.\nIn the 2010s, the sport experienced a surge of popularity.\nGovernance.\nThe governing body of baseball in Canada is Baseball Canada, which is based in Ottawa and was founded in 1964. Baseball Canada is a member of the Canadian Olympic Committee and the International Baseball Federation.\nNational team.\nThe Canadian national baseball team represents Canada in international competitions. Since 1970, the team has participated in 17 Baseball World Cups. Canada earned the bronze medal in the 2009 Baseball World Cup, their highest finish in the history of the competition. In the 2004 Summer Olympics they placed fourth, losing the game for 3rd place to Japan and, in 2008, they finished fifth. In four appearances so far at the World Baseball Classic, the team has not finished higher than 9th place. The national team also won gold medals at the 2011 and 2015 Pan American Games.\nClub competition.\nAfter the Montreal Expos were relocated to Washington, D.C., only one Canadian team plays in Major League Baseball, the Toronto Blue Jays. Among the Minor League Baseball system, a collection of minor leagues that hold a formal relationship with Major League Baseball, only one is based in Canada, the Vancouver Canadians. The Vancouver Canadians are presently affiliate of the Blue Jays, and play in the Northwest League at the High-A level.\nSeveral other Canada-based teams play in low-tier American independent circuits, including the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, and the Frontier League.\nNotable players.\nCanada has produced some successful players in Major League Baseball. Ferguson Jenkins and Larry Walker are currently the only Canadians in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The following table lists other achievements earned by Canadian baseball players."

        "title": "Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as \"Pitt\", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt men's basketball team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays their home games in the Petersen Events Center. The Panthers were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion twice by the Helms Athletic Foundation and once by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Pitt has reached one Final Four, received 15 First Team All-American selections, appeared in 27 NCAA tournaments through the 2022–23 season, and has recorded 1,674 victories against 1,232 losses since their inaugural season of 1905–06.\nHistory.\nInitial era.\nThe University of Pittsburgh began playing men's basketball in 1905–06 under coach Benjamin Printz. The University did not field a team during the 1909–10 and 1910–11 seasons. The program was resurrected in 1911 under head coach Walter \"Dutch\" Wohlfarth, and the following year Dr. George M. Flint assumed head coaching duties and began rebuilding Pitt's program essentially from the ground up. Flint led the Panthers to eight winning seasons during his ten years at the helm and coached future Pitt coach H. C. Carlson.\nH.C. \"Doc\" Carlson era (1922–1953).\nHenry Clifford \"Doc\" Carlson, MD took over as coach in 1922 and soon turned Pitt into a national power. In the era preceding the initiation of national tournaments, the Panthers were both contemporaneously and later retroactively, by the Helms Athletic Foundation (1927–28 and 1929–30) and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll (1927–28), regarded as national champions. Those teams were led by National Player of the Year, 3-time All-American and Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Charlie Hyatt. Carlson was a ground-breaking coach who into the Naismith and Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fames. In the late 1920s, Carlson initiated playing a \"national schedule\" by taking his teams on midwestern road trips that included games against several Big Ten schools and, in 1931, is credited as the first coach to take an Eastern team out west. He also developed the widely emulated Figure Eight Offense and also experimented with various conditioning techniques, including the use of oxygen on the bench. Under Carlson, and led by two-time All-American Claire Cribbs, Pitt continued success through the 1930s winning four Eastern Intercollegiate Conference championships. In 1935, Pitt, as Eastern Intercollegiate champions representing the best of the East, lost a 41–37 season-ending contest to SEC champion LSU in the American Legion Bowl in Atlantic City, a game on which LSU bases its claim on that season's national championship. On February 28, 1940, Pitt played in the first-ever televised basketball game, a 57–37 victory over Fordham at Madison Square Garden that was televised by NBC station W2XBS. Carlson also led Pitt to its first-ever NCAA appearance en route to the 1941 NCAA Final Four. Carlson's tenure at Pitt's helm lasted for 30 consecutive years before he retired following the 1952–53 season.\nPitt moved their competition into the Fitzgerald Field House in 1951, leaving the Pitt Pavilion, housed inside of Pitt Stadium. Pitt would continue to play in the Fieldhouse until 2002.\nBob Timmons era (1953–1968).\nRobert Timmons took over as head coach from Carlson for the 1953–54 season and led by two-time All-American and Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Don Hennon, appeared in two NCAA tournaments during the late 1950s. Timmons also led Pitt to an NCAA appearance in 1963 and its first NIT appearance in 1964.\nBuzz Ridl era (1968–1975).\nTimmons was succeeded by head coach Charles \"Buzz\" Ridl who became famous for his 'amoebe' defense, an ever changing man to zone match-up defense. With All-American Billy Knight, Ridl led Pitt to the Elite Eight in 1974, with early round victories over St. Joseph's and Furman. Pitt lost to eventual national champion North Carolina State in the Eastern Regional Final (Elite 8) played in Raleigh, North Carolina amid a hostile local crowd. This Pitt team was filled with local players such as Mickey Martin, Jim Bolla, Tom Richards, Keith Starr, Kirk Bruce and Billy Knight, who went on to star in the ABA for the Indiana Pacers and with several teams in the NBA. Following the graduation of Knight and Martin, Pitt made an NIT appearance the following year, Ridl's last before retiring.\nEastern Eight Conference (1976–1982).\nFor the 1976–77 season, Pitt began play as a member of the Eastern 8 Conference.\nTim Grgurich era (1975–1980).\nPittsburgh native Tim Grgurich, who was an assistant coach under Ridl, became Pitt's next head coach. He led Pitt into the inaugural 1976–77 season of the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League, which would change its name to the Eastern Eight (forerunner to the Atlantic 10) the following year. That initial year, Larry Harris, a 6'6\" forward with an impressive outside shot and an ability to score points in traffic, won the league scoring title. Grgurich also led Pitt to the 1980 NIT.\nRoy Chipman era (1980–1986).\nGrgurich was succeeded by Lafayette coach Dr. Roy Chipman who began Pitt's rollercoaster-like ride back to national significance. In his first season at the helm, the Panthers won the Eastern Eight Conference tournament. In the 1981 NCAA tournament, Pitt defeated Idaho in overtime in the first round; they lost to North Carolina in the second round. Chipman's Panthers enjoyed similar success the following season, defeating archrival West Virginia for their last Eastern Eight tournament Championship, energized by remarks by WVU Coach Gale Catlett. Pitt lost to Pepperdine in the first round of the 1982 NCAA tournament to end Chipman's second season and Pitt's last as a member of the Eastern Eight Conference.\nBig East Conference (1982–2013).\nFor the 1982–83 season, Pitt began play as a member of the Big East Conference.\nPaul Evans era (1986–1994).\nChipman would lead Pitt to three more postseason appearances, he retired from coaching after the 86 season and was replaced by Paul Evans as head coach in 1986–87. Led by All-Americans Charles Smith and Jerome Lane, Pitt would capture its first two regular season Big East Championships and secure several top 10 rankings reaching as high as number two in the nation. However, compared to the expectations of the fans, these teams had disappointing showings in their Big East and NCAA tournaments appearances. After the departures of Smith and Lane, Pitt basketball continued to have a national, if not inconsistent, impact with players such as Sean Miller, , , and Eric Mobley. In eight seasons as head coach Evans' teams advanced to a total of five NCAA tournaments and one NIT.\nRalph Willard era (1994–1999).\nSlumping play led to Evans' departure, and he was replaced by Ralph Willard who headed the Pitt program from 1994–95 through 1998–99. Despite highly regarded recruiting classes and stars such as Mark Blount and Vonteego Cummings, Pitt advanced to only one NIT in five seasons under Willard.\nBen Howland era (1999–2003).\nBen Howland was hired as head coach of the Panthers in 1999–00 and led them to sustained success for 4 seasons. In Howland's second season (2000–01), the Pitt team, led by senior standout Ricardo Greer and All-American guard Brandin Knight, advanced to the Big East tournament championship game and NIT. In Howland's third (2001–02) and fourth (2002–03) seasons, Pitt won back-to-back Big East regular season championships, appeared in back-to-back Big East tournament championship games and won the Big East tournament in 2003. Pitt advanced to consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteens (2002, 2003). For his success in the 2001–02 season, Howland was named the Big East Coach of the Year, Naismith College Coach of the Year, and won the Henry Iba Award as best college basketball coach as named by the United States Basketball Writers Association. Following the 2003 season, Howland left Pitt for the only job he said he would ever contemplate leaving Pitt for: the head coach position at UCLA.\nIn 2002, Pitt began their first season of play at the 12,508-seat Petersen Events Center which sits on the former site of Pitt Stadium. The first opponent at \"the Pete\", as the facility is called by students, was against cross-city rival Duquesne University.\nAtlantic Coast Conference (2013–present).\nFor the 2013–14 season, Pitt began play as a member of the ACC.\nJamie Dixon era (2003–2016).\nJamie Dixon, Howland's assistant at Northern Arizona and Pitt, was named head coach of the team in 2003. Under Dixon, the Panthers continued the progress begun under Howland, registering a third straight Big East regular season championship (2004), a fourth straight appearance in the Big East tournament championship game (Pitt 58, UConn 61) and a third straight appearance in the NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen. With Dixon at the helm, Pitt's success continued with frequent national rankings, four Big East tournament championship game appearances in five seasons (2004, 2006, 2007 2008), a Big East tournament Championship in 2008, and NCAA tournament appearances in nine of ten years under Dixon's leadership (2004–11, 2013), including trips to the Sweet Sixteen (2004, 2007, 2009) and Elite Eight (2009).\nThe 2008–09 season was notable for several historic accomplishments. The Panthers were ranked #1 in the Associated Press poll and ESPN/USA Today Coaches' poll for the first time in school history, claiming the #1 spot for a total of three weeks. On February 16, 2009, the #4 ranked Panthers defeated the #1 ranked UConn Huskies, 76–68, for Pitt's first-ever win versus a #1 ranked team. The Panthers repeated the feat on March 7, 2009, when the #3 ranked Panthers again defeated #1 ranked UConn again, 70–60, for Pitt's second-ever win versus a #1 ranked team. In doing so, Pitt became only the seventh school in NCAA Division I history to defeat two #1 ranked teams in the same season. On Selection Sunday, March 15, 2009, the Panthers received their first ever No.1 seed (East Region) in the 2009 NCAA tournament. They reached the Elite Eight for the first time since 1974. Pitt's 76–78 last second loss to fellow Big East Conference foe Villanova in the East Regional final for a trip to the Final Four became an instant classic. In 2009, Dixon broke the record for the most victories in the first six seasons as a Division I head coach and won the Naismith Coach of the Year award.\nThe success of the 2008–09 season continued over to the 2009–10 season, somewhat unexpectedly. Having lost the talents of Sam Young, DeJuan Blair and Levance Fields, the Panthers were picked in a pre-season Big East poll to finish ninth in the conference. Instead, Pitt earned a 13–5 Big East record, good enough for a second seed in the Big East tournament, received a third seed in the NCAA tournament, and finished 25–9 overall record. In 2010–11, Pitt won the regular season Big East title and, for a second time in the program's history, earned a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nThe program achieved a school record 10-straight seasons with at least 20 overall wins, 10 conference wins, and an NCAA Tournament appearance from 2002 through 2011. Dixon, who has been named as a national coach of the year in three separate seasons, guided Pitt to NCAA Tournament appearances in his first eight seasons as head coach, and is the only head coach in school history to guide Pitt to eight NCAA Tournament appearances (2004–2011).\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference announced in September 2011 that Pitt and Syracuse would be leaving the Big East and had been accepted as members of the ACC, which would grow from 12 to 14 teams. Pitt officially joined the ACC on July 1, 2013.\nIn 2011–12, Pitt failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament, but managed to again surpass 20 wins for the 11th consecutive season and qualify for the College Basketball Invitational for a 12th consecutive post-season appearance. Pitt defeated Washington State in the Finals in a best 2 out of 3 format to win the post-season tournament.\nDixon's record at Pitt stood at 262 wins and 86 losses (.753 win percentage) in ten seasons (2003–04 through 2012–13), second in school history behind only Carlson. His league record of 127–66 in ten seasons made him the winningest coach in Big East history with a .658 winning percentage in league games and tournaments.\nOn March 31, 2010, Pitt extended Dixon's contract by two years, making him Pitt's head coach through 2017–18 season. Dixon signed another contract extension on March 23, 2013. This extension ran through the 2022–2023 season. Upon the extension, Dixon commented saying that his intentions were to \"finish his career at the University of Pittsburgh.\" Dixon, however, departed to take the head coaching position at his alma mater, TCU, on March 21, 2016, after Pitt grew dissatisfied with his team's results and lowered his contract buyout clause to make it easier for him to leave.\nKevin Stallings era (2016–2018).\nOn March 28, 2016, the school hired Vanderbilt head coach Kevin Stallings to fill the vacant head coaching position. Pitt went 16–17 and finished 14th in the ACC, its first losing season in 17 years. The Panthers notably lost to Duquesne for the first time since 2000 and suffered a 106–51 loss to Louisville, their worst loss since 1906. The disappointing season was punctuated by a blowout home loss to #1 Virginia on senior night, during which the Panthers managed only 7 first half points against the Cavaliers. In Stallings second season Pitt went 8–24 and went 0–18 in ACC conference play. Pitt finished 15th and last in the conference. On March 8, 2018, Pitt fired Stallings.\nJeff Capel era (2018–present).\nOn March 27, 2018, Duke associate head coach Jeff Capel reached an agreement to become the 16th head basketball coach at Pitt. Capel previously served as head coach at VCU (2002–06) and Oklahoma (2006–11). In the 2022-23 season, the Panthers finished with a regular season record of 21-10 and made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in six years. The 11-seed Panthers defeated Mississippi State 60-59 in the First Four and 6-seed Iowa State 59-41 in the first round before suffering a loss to 3-seed Xavier by a score of 84-73.\nTraditions.\nStudent section.\nThe \"Oakland Zoo\" is the student cheering section for the men's and women's basketball teams. The Zoo cheers on the Panthers from the bottom tier of the stands at the Petersen Events Center, primarily across from the teams' benches and on the baselines under the baskets. The \"Pete\" holds a rowdy crowd of 1,500 students that are typically uniformly clad in gold t-shirts, and the Zoo student section is consistently sold out for Panthers home games. The Oakland Zoo is named after Oakland, the neighborhood in which the university is located. The name \"Oakland Zoo\" is used for the basketball cheering sections only; the football cheering section has often used the title, \"The Panther Pitt.\"\nRivalries.\nWest Virginia.\nThe fiercest rivalry was with former Big East Conference member West Virginia University in the basketball version of the Backyard Brawl, an extension of the football rivalry. Adding to the importance of the game, Pitt and West Virginia shared membership in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (1933–1939), the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League West Division (1977), Eastern 8 Conference (1978–1982), and the Big East Conference (1996–2012). In addition, the two rivals have tangled in the last games played at three of their respective arenas: on February 26, 1951, Pitt defeated WVU 74–72 in the closing seconds of the last college game played at the Pitt Pavilion inside Pitt Stadium; on March 3, 1970, Pitt upset WVU 92–87 in the last game played at the West Virginia University Field House in Morgantown; and on March 2, 2002, Pitt defeated WVU 92–65 in Pitt's last game at Fitzgerald Field House. The two teams last met on February 16, 2012, resulting in a 66–48 Mountaineer victory. The Panthers and Mountaineers are scheduled to resume their annual series as part of the nonconference schedule beginning with the 2017–18 season, ending a 5-year absence. Pitt will host games in 2017 and 2019, while WVU will host games in the 2018 and 2020 seasons. WVU remains as Pitt's most-played opponent, with 184 meetings having been played between the schools as of the end of the 2011–12 season. West Virginia leads the series 98 to 88.\nPenn State.\nAnother spill-over from the gridiron, the Panthers' third-most frequently-played opponent is the Penn State Nittany Lions, whom they have played 148 times. Penn State leads the all-time series, 76–72. They played at least once every year from 1935–82 and briefly rekindled the rivalry at the turn of the century, playing annually from 2000–05. Since that time, they’ve gone against each other just twice, in 2013 as part of the Big Ten-ACC Challenge, and in the 2016 Never Forget Tribute Classic. They are not scheduled to renew the series in the foreseeable future, though there have been significant talks between the universities about doing so.\nDuquesne.\nThe Panthers also have a sustained rivalry with crosstown opponent Duquesne University in The City Game. Peaking in ferocity from 1977–1982 when both were members of the Eastern Eight Conference, the rivalry has diminished somewhat since Pitt's move to the Big East Conference in 1982.\nSyracuse.\nA spillover from their football rivalry, the Panthers and Syracuse University also maintain a rivalry on the hardwood. The series intensified during the first decade of this century, during which both teams were highly competitive in the Big East and made numerous appearances in both the AP Top 10 and NCAA Tournament. They continue to play at least twice each season as members of the ACC.\n2-time National Champions.\nPitt men's basketball teams of 1927–28 (21–0) and 1929–30 (23–2) were recognized as national champions both popularly and by the Helms Athletic Foundation. These teams of \"Doc\" Carlson, led by three-time All-American and two-time National Scoring Champion Charley Hyatt, played a \"national\" schedule that during the 1927–28 season that included the following wins:\nThe 1929–30 national championship team racked up wins that included the following:\nAlthough there was no NCAA Tournament at that time, there were contests billed as \"National Championship Games\". The 1930 game in particular helped Pittsburgh legend Charley Hyatt cement his place in history by scoring 27 points, including a last second game-winning shot, at the defending national champions and assumed #1 squad Montana State.\nEarly-season national tournaments.\nStarting with the NCAA rule change regarding exempt tournaments in the 2006–07 season, Pitt has participated in an event every year, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Panthers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 27 times.

Pitt played in the Eastern 8 Tournament Championship games in 1979, 1981, and 1982.\nIndividual awards &amp; honors.\nNational honors.\nNational Player of the Year.\nCharley Hyatt won the National Player of the Year in 1929–30, he was the America's leading scorer that season (his second time as leading scorer) and made a last second basket to win the National Title Game with 27 points against what many considered the best team in the country. This season was also to be the third consecutive time he had earned consensus All-American status (the second time he won the honor owing to him being in the inaugural class of consensus in his second season).\nHall of Fame inductees.\nThree inductees represent the University of Pittsburgh in the Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fame; two of them, Carlson and Hyatt, are also represented in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.

        "title": "1982 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 1982 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament was the first Women's Basketball Tournament held under the auspices of the NCAA. From 1972 to 1982, there were national tournaments for Division I schools held under the auspices of the AIAW. The inaugural NCAA Tournament included 32 teams. Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Cheyney State, and Maryland met in the Final Four, held at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia and hosted by Old Dominion University, with Louisiana Tech defeating Cheyney for the title, 76-62. Louisiana Tech's Janice Lawrence was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. Her teammate Kim Mulkey went on to become the first (and to date only) woman to win NCAA Division I basketball titles as a player and coach, winning the 2005, 2012, 2019 titles as head coach at Baylor and the 2023 title at LSU. (Mulkey was also an assistant coach on Louisiana Tech's 1988 championship team).\nNotable events.\nWhile the 1982 tournament was the first tournament under the NCAA, many of the participating teams had a long history of tournament experience. The Louisiana Tech team made it to the Final Four of the 1979, 1980 and 1981 AIAW Tournaments, winning the National Championship with a perfect 34–0 record in 1981. The Lady Techsters were favorites to repeat, as their team entered the 1982 NCAA tournaments with only a single loss on the season. The team included two Kodak All-Americans, Pam Kelly and Angela Turner. Pam Kelly would win the Wade Trophy, awarded to the nation's best Division I women's basketball player. Her teammates included Janice Lawrence and Kim Mulkey, both of whom would play on the gold-medal-winning Olympic team in 1984. The team had two head coaches. Sonja Hogg had been head coach of the team since its formation in 1974. Hogg brought Leon Barmore on to the coaching staff in 1977. In 1982, Barmore shared head coaching duties with Hogg, which he would do until 1985, when Hogg stepped down.\nThe Louisiana Tech team won their first game easily, beating Tennessee Tech 114–52. They easily won their next two games against Arizona State and Kentucky, to advance to the Final Four, the only number one seed to make it to the finals.\nThe Lady Techsters faced the Lady Vols from Tennessee in the semi-finals, and won 69–46. In the National Championship game, they faced Cheyney State, coached by future Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer. The Cheyney State team entered the match-up on a 23-game winning streak. The Louisiana Tech team hit 56% of their field goals attempts to win easily, 76–62, and win the first National Championship in the NCAA era.\nThe winners are awarded national championship rings, but this team did not receive theirs until January 13, 2017.\nRecords.\nIn the semifinal game between Louisiana Tech and Tennessee, Louisiana Tech's Pam Kelly made twelve of fourteen free throw attempts. Twelve made free throws, equaled twice since, remains the Women's Final Four Game Record for \"Most Free Throws\" through the 2015 tournament.\nIn the west regional final between Drake and Maryland, Lorri Bauman scored 50 points in a losing effort. Her scoring mark is still the single game record for an NCAA Tournament game. Her 21 made field goals, out of 35 attempts, both of which remain as single game tournament records. In the first-round game against Ohio State, Bauman hit all 16 of her free throws. While several players have subsequently made all of their attempted free throws, no one has a perfect record with more than 16.\nIn the three games of her tournament, Bauman scored a total of 110 points, for an average of 36.7 points per game. No player has surpassed that per game scoring mark, through 2012.\nBauman's 50 point performance qualified as one of the top 25 moments of NCAA Tournament history as chronicled by ESPN and the NCAA.com as part of the 25th anniversary celebration of NCAA women's basketball.\nQualifying teams - automatic.\nThirty-two teams were selected to participate in the 1982 NCAA Tournament. Twelve conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1982 NCAA tournament. (Not all conference records are available for 1982) \nQualifying teams - at-large.\nTwenty additional teams were selected to complete the thirty-two invitations. (Not all conference records are available for 1982)\nFirst round.\nThe thirty-two teams were seeded, and assigned to sixteen locations. In each case, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game, and all sixteen teams hosted.\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and location, while a map of the locations is shown to the right:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe Regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 18 to March 21 at these sites:\nEach regional winner will advance to the Final Four, held March 26 and 28 in Norfolk, Virginia at the Norfolk Scope.\nBids by state.\nThe thirty-two teams came from twenty-one states, plus Washington, D.C.\nCalifornia and Tennessee had the most teams with three each. Twenty-nine states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nRecord by conference.\nEight conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nSix conferences went 0-1: MAAC, MAC, MEAC, Northern California, Ohio Valley Conference, and SWAC"

        "title": "Paul Palmer (American football)",
        "text": "Paul Woodrow Palmer (born October 14, 1964) is an American former professional football running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys. He also was a member of the Barcelona Dragons in the World League of American Football (WLAF). He played college football for the Temple Owls.\nEarly years.\nPalmer attended Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland. He was a versatile running back and led the state in kickoff returns as a senior.\nPaul accepted a football scholarship from Temple University, to play under head coach Bruce Arians. As a freshman he was a backup that struggled with ball security. He registered 141 carries for 628 yards (4.5-yard average), 6 rushing touchdowns, 33 receptions for 271 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nAs a sophomore, Palmer replaced the injured starter Brian Slade at running back against Boston College, making 11 carries for 98 yards. The next game against the University of Cincinnati, he registered 92 rushing yards. His first start came against the University of Delaware, collecting 144 rushing yards. He posted 182 carries for 885 yards (4.9/yard average), 9 touchdowns, 29 receptions for 197 yards and one touchdown.\nAs a junior, he became one of the top running backs in the nation, recording 275 carries for 1,516 yards, 9 touchdowns, 13 receptions for 131 yards and one touchdown. Against Penn State, he rushed for 206 yards.\nAs a senior in 1986, Palmer led the Division I in rushing yards (1,866) and all-purpose yards (2,633), breaking Marcus Allen's single-season all-purpose yardage NCAA record. He also registered 346 carries and 15 touchdowns. Against East Carolina University, he tallied 349 rushing yards (school record), 3 touchdowns and tied the single-game record for all-purpose yards with 417. In his next three games he rushed for 239, 187, and 212 yards respectively, setting NCAA records for rushing yards in consecutive games, three straight contests and four consecutive games. Paul was the runner-up to Vinny Testaverde for the 1986 Heisman Trophy award, even though Temple did not have nationally televised games.\nIn July 1988, it emerged that Palmer had signed with agent Norby Walters before his eligibility expired (he received monthly payments and a $5,000 loan). Temple forfeited all six of its wins from the 1986 season, erased all of Palmer's records from the books, and withdrew all of Palmer's athletic prizes and rewards. School president Peter Liacouras also ordered Palmer to reimburse Temple for his senior year scholarship. In a deal with federal prosecutors who were investigating Walters, Palmer agreed to perform 150 to 250 hours of community service. Years later, the school decided to recognize Palmer’s 1986 season, after he showed remorse for his decisions and their effects on Temple.\nDuring Palmers college career he ranked sixth in NCAA Division I history in rushing yards and fourth in all-purpose yards, setting 23 school records including career rushing yards (4,895), career rushing attempts (944), career all-purpose yards (6,613), career rushing touchdowns (39), career 100-yard games (21), career 200-yard games (6) and points (264).\nIn 2000, Palmer was inducted into the Temple Athletics Hall of Fame. On January 8, 2018, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, becoming the first player from Temple to receive such an honor.\nProfessional career.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nPalmer was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round (19th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft. His great-grandmother Frances Palmer who raised him since he was 2 years old, died the day he was drafted and Paul chose to spend the day with his family. As a rookie, Palmer was mostly used on special teams, leading the AFC in kickoff return average (24.3 yards per attempt). He was named to the NFL's All-Rookie Team, and was named NFL All-Pro as a kick returner.\nIn 1988, through the first six weeks Paul led the team in rushing, receiving, scoring and combined yards from scrimmage. He would later have clashes with the coaching staff and not be able to take over the starting running back position from Christian Okoye. On September 4, 1989, Palmer was waived by new head coach Marty Schottenheimer. He rushed for 607 yards in two seasons.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn September 5, 1989, Palmer was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Lions, reuniting with Frank Gansz who was his head coach with the Chiefs. On October 16, after five games without a single rushing attempt and 11 kickoff returns for 255 yards, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for an eighth round draft choice (#194-Willie Green).\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn 1989, he became the starting running back after Herschel Walker was traded to the Minnesota Vikings. Palmer led the Cowboys with 446 yards on 112 carries during 9 games, on a team that would finish with a 1–15 record for the 1989 season, and that had the second lowest 16-game rushing total in franchise history (after the 2012 season), with quarterback Troy Aikman as the team's second-leading rusher with 302 yards. Palmer played a key role in the only win the team had that season (against Washington), when Paul registered the only 100-yard rushing game of his career, after gaining 110 yards and scoring a touchdown.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn March 30, 1990, the Cincinnati Bengals signed him in Plan B free agency. Palmer led the team in kickoff return yardage during the preseason (5 kick returns for an average of 23 yards, including a 49-yarder against Atlanta). He was released on August 20.\nBarcelona Dragons (first stint).\nIn 1991, he was drafted by the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football. During the first 4 games Palmer was the league's second leading rusher, but a hamstring injury limited him to just 39 yards the rest of the season. He finished as the team's second leading-rusher behind Jim Bell, recording 358 yards and 3 touchdowns.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn June 27, 1991, Paul was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Eagles. He was released on August 5.\nBarcelona Dragons (second stint).\nIn 1992, Palmer finished his professional career in the World League of American Football with the Barcelona Dragons. He was the Dragons starting running back, tallying 259 total rushing yards.\nPersonal life.\nPalmer spent 12 seasons as an assistant football coach at Haddon Heights High School. He is currently a radio analyst for Temple football games."

        "text": "The Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represents the University of Memphis in NCAA Division I men's college basketball. The Tigers have competed in the American Athletic Conference since 2013. As of 2020, the Tigers had the 26th highest winning percentage in NCAA history. While the Tigers have an on-campus arena, Elma Roane Fieldhouse (which is still the primary home for Tigers women's basketball), the team has played home games off campus since the mid-1960s. The Tigers moved to the Mid-South Coliseum at the Memphis Fairgrounds in 1966, and then to downtown Memphis at The Pyramid, initially built for the team in 1991 and later home to the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. In 2004, both teams moved to a new downtown venue, FedExForum. \"ESPN Stats and Information Department\" ranked Memphis as the 19th most successful basketball program from 1962 to 2012 in their annual \"50 in 50\" list.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe predecessor of the University of Memphis, West Tennessee State Normal School, first put a basketball team on the court in 1920. Zach Curlin began coaching the team in 1924. The Tigers joined the Mississippi Valley Conference in 1928. The team played its early home games at a local high school gym, a local YMCA, and in a room on campus called the \"Normal Cage\" which allowed only six inches from the court lines to the walls. In 1929, a $100,000 facility on campus named Memorial Gym became the Tigers' home.\nCurlin's last season coaching the Tigers was in 1948, by which time the school had been renamed Memphis State College; it would become Memphis State University in 1957. His successor was McCoy Tarry. In 1951, the new $700,000 Fieldhouse gym was opened for Tiger home games. In 1952, John Wallesea became the first Memphis State player to be drafted by the NBA. Forest Arnold became the school's first All-American in 1954. The Tigers made the NCAA tournament for the first time, in 1955, under coach Eugene Lambert. Bob Vanatta became the team's coach in 1956 and took the Tigers to the NIT final. Win Wilfong became the team's second All-American in 1957.\nIn 1962, Dean Ehlers took over coaching duties. The Tigers began playing its home games at the Mid-South Coliseum in 1964. Moe Iba became the team's coach in 1966, the same year the team joined the Missouri Valley Conference. Iba's four years running the program are considered the low point in the history of Memphis basketball, with the team suffering 19 and 20 loss seasons before Iba's dismissal. However, the Tigers did not remain down for long.\n1970s.\nIn 1970, Gene Bartow was named head coach. The 1970 season also saw the first games of Larry Finch and Ronnie Robinson, two all-time greats. Larry Finch scored 24 points in his first appearance as a freshman. In 1971, the Tigers led by Finch and Robinson upset conference rival Louisville. At 11–2, they were ranked #19 after not reaching the Top 20 in a decade. Early in the 1971–1972 season, Memphis State fell in a heart breaker to No. 2 Marquette after leading by five points with five minutes to go. After defeating Louisville in Freedom Hall, the Tigers shared the Missouri Valley Conference title in 1972 with Louisville. Louisville won a playoff to represent the MVC in the NCAA Tournament while the Tigers went to the NIT for their fifth time.\nDuring the 1972–1973 season, seniors Finch and Robinson led the Tigers to one of their most successful seasons. Memphis State won the MVC outright in 1972 after winning 14 straight games. They went to the NCAA tournament where they handily beat South Carolina and Kansas State after a first round bye to reach the Final Four. After beating Providence, the Tigers went to play for the national championship against the UCLA Bruins led by legendary coach John Wooden and led by star Bill Walton. Keeping it close in the first half, the Tigers were overwhelmed in the second half eventually losing by 21, 87–66. Bartow won the NABC National Coach of the Year award that season and Larry Finch was named a consensus All-American. Also on the Finals team was Larry Kenon who went on to be a 2-time All-Star in the NBA. He remains one of the most successful NBA players in Memphis history. Wayne Yates took over for Bartow in 1974 when Bartow left for Illinois. Yates led Memphis State to three straight 20-win seasons, including an NCAA Tournament berth in 1976. The Tigers left the Missouri Valley Conference to become one of the inaugural members of the Metro Conference in 1976. Dana Kirk became head coach in 1979.\n1980s.\nIn the 1980s, the Tigers made seven NCAA tournaments and won three Metro Conference titles, amassing a record of 230–87 (.726). Keith Lee began playing for the Tigers in 1982, and Memphis was ranked number one in both major national polls for the first time the same year. However, that same night they were knocked off by Virginia Tech 69–56 in Blacksburg. In the 1983 NCAA tournament, the Tigers beat Georgetown led by Patrick Ewing, whom Lee dominated in the paint. They lost their next game to top-seed Houston led by Hakeem Olajuwon.\nAfter finishing 24–3 in the regular season, the 1984–1985 season proved to be another memorable one in Tiger history. Lee eventually led the team to another NCAA tournament in 1985. Memphis State beat Penn, UAB, Boston College and Oklahoma to reach the school's second Final Four. They were defeated by eventual champion Villanova and finished the season 31–4. All but one of the 12 players on this team were from Memphis or Shelby County. Lee was named a consensus All-American for the third time in his four-year career. In 1986, Kirk was forced out after becoming the subject of a criminal investigation. He was also found to have committed many NCAA violations as well. The Tigers were forced to sit out the 1987 NCAA tournament and were stripped of all of their NCAA tournament appearances from 1982 to 1986, including the 1985 Final Four run. Kirk's top assistant, Larry Finch, one of the leaders of the fabled 1972–73 team, took over head coaching duties in 1986. One of Finch's first recruits, Elliot Perry, began playing for the team in 1987. Perry led Memphis State to the 1988 and 1989 NCAA Tournaments and was drafted to the NBA where he became a successful player. In the 1988–89 season, the Tigers set a school record by starting the game against arch-rival Louisville with a 24–0 run.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, Finch landed the country's highest rated high school recruit, Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway. The Tigers also moved to the Great Midwest Conference and began playing their home games at the new Pyramid Arena (affectionately known as the \"Tomb of Doom\") in 1991. Stand-out Hardaway led Memphis State to the 1992 NCAA tournament, where the Tigers were defeated in the Elite Eight by rival Cincinnati. The following summer, Hardaway was named All-American and earned a chance to train with the Dream Team before the Barcelona Olympics. During the 1992–93 season, Hardaway earned Memphis State's first triple-double and then the first back-to-back triple-doubles in wins over Georgia State and Vanderbilt. On February 6, 1993, the school achieved its 1,000th all-time basketball victory in an upset over No. 4 Cincinnati. After the season, Penny Hardaway left for the NBA draft where he was selected third overall by the Golden State Warriors. He became the most successful NBA player in history to matriculate from the Memphis basketball program. In 1994, Memphis State changed its name to the University of Memphis.\nIn 1995, the Memphis team included future NBA players David Vaughn, Cedric Henderson, and Lorenzen Wright, and they made it to the 1995 NCAA tournament where they lost in the Sweet Sixteen. Memphis joined Conference USA in 1995 as a founding member with long-time rivals Louisville and Cincinnati. Finch stepped down as head coach in 1997 and Tic Price took over thereafter. Price's three years were one of the Tigers' least successful since the 1960s. He was forced to resign just days before the start of the 1999–2000 season after school officials discovered he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a student at the university. Johnny Jones spent one year as interim head coach while the school looked for a replacement.\n2000s.\nJohn Calipari was named Memphis' head coach in 2000. Under his leadership, the Tigers won the 2002 NIT championship, then made the NCAA tournament in 2003 and 2004. The Tigers left The Pyramid to play home games in the FedExForum in 2004. The 2005–06 Tigers were led by Darius Washington, Shawne Williams and Rodney Carney and set a school record by going 30–3 and reaching a No. 3 ranking during a regular season that was capped by a Conference USA championship. In the 2006 NCAA tournament, the Tigers received a number one seed, and they advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual tournament runner-up UCLA.\nDespite losing their top three scorers from the prior season to the NBA and graduation, the 2006–07 Tigers duplicated the previous year's regular season record of 30–3, were ranked as high as No. 5, and again won the Conference USA championship, going undefeated in conference play. The Tigers earned a number two seed in the 2007 NCAA tournament. The Tigers defeated 15 seed North Texas in the first round, 7 seed Nevada in the second round, and 3 seed Texas A&amp;M in the Sweet Sixteen, and lost to 1 seed and eventual tournament runner-up Ohio State in the Elite Eight.\nThe 2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team achieved a No. 1 ranking in the Associated Press basketball poll in January 2008, the school's first No. 1 ranking in the poll since 1982, and went on to win their third straight Conference USA title on March 15, 2008. After a month, they lost this ranking when they were defeated by in-state rival and No. 2-ranked Tennessee at home. Led by First-Team All-American Chris Douglas-Roberts and future No. 1 overall pick Derrick Rose, the team received a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament and defeated No. 16 seed Texas-Arlington in round one, No. 8 seed Mississippi State in round two, and No. 5 seed Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen. Memphis convincingly defeated No. 2 seed Texas in the Elite Eight round to advance to the school's first Final Four since 1985. Following this win, Memphis went on to beat No. 1 seed UCLA on April 5, 2008, advancing to the National Championship game on April 7, 2008. With this win, Memphis became the first team in NCAA history to achieve 38 wins in a single season. After holding a nine-point lead with two minutes and 12 seconds left in regulation, the Tigers lost to Kansas in the National Championship in overtime by the final score of 75–68, becoming the second NCAA runner-up team in Memphis history.\nThe 2008–09 Tigers, led by another freshman guard, Tyreke Evans, again went undefeated in Conference USA and earned a two seed in the 2009 NCAA tournament. The Tigers were defeated by the No. 3-seed Missouri Tigers in the Sweet Sixteen. Evans left after one year and was named NBA Rookie of the Year in 2010, the second straight Tiger to do so after Rose. On March 31, 2009, Calipari resigned to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky. In the months following Calipari's departure, nearly all of the incoming recruits who had committed to play basketball for the University of Memphis decommitted from Memphis and committed to Kentucky or other schools. The recruits included Xavier Henry, DeMarcus Cousins, Nolan Dennis, and Darnell Dodson.\nOn May 28, 2009, the NCAA formally accused the Tigers of allowing an ineligible player to participate in their games during the 2007–08 season. On August 20, 2009, the NCAA Committee on Infractions announced that Memphis must vacate all 38 wins for that season as well as their appearance in the NCAA tournament and spend three years on probation. The NCAA alleged that Derrick Rose, a Chicago native, had obtained a fraudulent SAT score when another person took the test for him in Detroit, Michigan and his brother Reggie Rose was provided nearly $1,700 in free travel and lodging with the Memphis team. The University of Memphis was not charged with knowingly fielding an ineligible player given that Rose had originally been cleared by the testing company and the NCAA. Rather, the NCAA imposed the penalty on a \"strict liability\" standard which held that Memphis must vacate their wins regardless of whether the school had any knowledge of wrongdoing by Rose and regardless of the NCAA's original clearance of Rose.\n2010s – present.\nOn April 7, 2009, Josh Pastner was named the team's head coach. Pastner was hired as an assistant at Memphis in 2008 after serving as an assistant coach under Lute Olson at Arizona for six years. Pastner gained a reputation as a strong recruiter during his tenure at Arizona. In his first year as coach at Memphis, Pastner brought in Elliot Williams, a transfer from Duke, who led the team in scoring and was drafted to the NBA. Williams was permitted to play his first season after departing Calipari took with him Memphis' top-ranked recruiting class. In 2011 Pastner led the Tigers back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in his coaching career, though they lost in the first round to his former team, Arizona.\nDuring the 2011–12 season, the Tigers announced they were leaving Conference USA to join the Big East Conference starting in 2013 (later renamed the American Athletic Conference). They began the season strong, moving as high to No. 13 in the country before falling out of the rankings (a phenomenon which would become a recurrent theme of the Pastner era). In the last game of the season, Josh Pastner's victory over Tulsa gave him 72 career victories, the most by a Memphis head coach over his first three seasons. Memphis made its second straight NCAA Tournament after winning the Conference USA tournament. An 8-seed, the Tigers lost in the first round to 9-seeded Saint Louis. After the season, sophomore star Will Barton left for the NBA.\nIn 2012–13, the Tigers, led by CUSA player of the year Joe Jackson, won the Conference USA regular season and tournament titles in their last season in CUSA. The Tigers began competition in the then newly formed American Athletic Conference in 2013. AAC competition was not as kind to the Pastner-led Tigers, as they earned an NCAA tournament berth in only 1 of the team's first 3 seasons in the AAC.\nOn April 8, 2016, facing mounting criticism in Memphis, Pastner took the job of head men's basketball coach at Georgia Tech. A few days later, the Tigers hired Tubby Smith to take over the head coaching job. Smith had just won the Big 12 coach of the year award as well as some national coaching awards for his season at Texas Tech.\nSmith was fired on March 14, 2018, after failing to reach the NCAA Tournament in both of his two years as head coach. Penny Hardaway was later confirmed as Smith's replacement.\nOn March 28, 2021, the Tigers won their second NIT tournament with a 77–65 win over the #4 seed Mississippi State Bulldogs, finishing their season at 20–8.\nOn June 11, 2021 speculation began to circulate that Penny Hardaway was a candidate for multiple head coaching jobs in the NBA, including his former team the Orlando Magic. On June 28, reports emerged that Hardaway had in fact interviewed and emerged as a top candidate for the Magic's vacant head coaching job. Two days later, via Instagram, Hardaway confirmed he was not leaving the University of Memphis, and reports emerged the same day that Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown had accepted an offer to be his assistant.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Tigers have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 28 times. Their overall record is 35–27. However, wins in 1982–1986 and 2008 have been vacated.\n\"* = vacated by NCAA\"\nNIT results.\nThe Tigers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 19 times. Their combined record is 24–17 and they were NIT champions in 2002 and 2021.\nAwards.\nBasketball Hall of Fame.\nThe Memphis program has had two coaches inducted into the National College Basketball Hall of Fame (Gene Bartow) and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (John Calipari). The school has yet to produce any players that have been inducted. Larry Brown was hired as an assistant in 2021 and was already a member of both the College and Naismith halls of fame.\nAll-Americans.\nMemphis has had 9 players chosen as All-Americans by the four sources used by the NCAA to determine consensus teams, the Associated Press, the United States Basketball Writers Association, the National Association of Basketball Coaches and \"The Sporting News\" (which replaced the United Press International in 1998). Three players have been unanimous first team selections (Keith Lee, Anfernee Hardaway, and Chris Douglas-Roberts). Keith Lee was the only Tiger to be selected more than once, eventually being selected three of his four years at Memphis.\nSource:\nSchool recognized.\nAccording to the program's records, the school recognizes the following bodies for their selection of All-America teams: UPI, Converse, ESPN, Associated Press, \"Basketball Times\", \"Basketball Weekly\", USBWA, \"The Sporting News\", Scripps-Howard, Wooden Award, CBSSports.com, FOXSports.com, Collegehoops.net, Rivals.com, NBC, NABC, \"College Sports\", Collegeinsider.com, \"Sports Illustrated\", NaismithLives.com and Rupp Trophy. They recognize all levels including honorable mentions and freshman teams.\nThe University of Memphis currently recognizes 38 players as All-Americans:\nMemphis Tigers in the NBA.\nSince the NBA draft began in 1947, 52 players from Memphis have been drafted, with an additional nine played after being signed as undrafted free agents. Of the 52 drafted players, 28 played in at least one NBA (or ABA) game. Memphis has produced 14 first-round picks, including 8 top-ten picks and one number-one pick (Derrick Rose). Three former Tigers have been named NBA All-Stars: Larry Kenon (twice), Penny Hardaway (4 times), and Derrick Rose (3 times). Four have gone on to win the NBA Championship: Win Wilfong with the St. Louis Hawks in 1958, William Bedford with the Detroit Pistons in 1990, Earl Barron with the Miami Heat in 2006, and James Wiseman with the Golden State Warriors in 2022. In 2010, Memphis became the second college to produce two consecutive NBA Rookie of the Year winners: Derrick Rose in 2009 and Tyreke Evans in 2010 (the first being North Carolina with winners Walter Davis in 1978 and Phil Ford in 1979). In 2011, Rose became the first former Tiger to be named the NBA Most Valuable Player. Many Memphis players since the 1960s that have gone undrafted or had unsuccessful NBA careers have also played in professional leagues in Europe, Asia and/or Latin America.\nCurrent NBA Players.\nAs of the 2022–23 NBA Season, seven former Tigers are currently signed to NBA rosters.\nRetired jerseys.\nThe University of Memphis has retired nine jerseys. Chris Douglas-Roberts, guard/forward from 2005 to 2008, declined the University of Memphis' invitation to have his #14 jersey retired in 2017."

It is usually held in four rounds, but can vary, depending on the conference. All Division I Conferences hold a conference tournament. \nWinners of each tournament get an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Since 2006, the top seed in each conference tournament, regardless of how they perform, has been guaranteed an automatic bid to either the National Invitation Tournament, if they fail to win the conference tournament, or the conference's automatic bid if they are successful. (Conferences are only permitted to stage postseason tournaments if the tournament winner receives the conference's sole automatic NCAA bid.)\nThe process is identical for women's basketball, with the exception that the Women's National Invitation Tournament (which does not operate as an official NCAA tournament, unlike its men's counterpart) guarantees an automatic bid to all 32 conferences as well, with the highest-ranking team in each conference that did not reach the NCAA tournament receiving the automatic bid to the NIT."

        "title": "Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represents Indiana University Bloomington in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Big Ten Conference. The Hoosiers play at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on the Branch McCracken Court in Bloomington, Indiana on the Indiana University Bloomington campus. Indiana has won five National Championships in men's basketball (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987) – two coming under Branch McCracken and three under Bob Knight. For forty-seven years and counting, Indiana's 1976 squad remains the last undefeated NCAA men's basketball champion.\nThe Hoosiers are sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (41), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (68), tied for eighth in Final Four appearances (8), and 10th in overall victories. The Hoosiers have won 22 Big Ten Conference Championships, which is second most in conference history, behind only Purdue (25). The Hoosiers also rank eighth in all-time AP poll appearances (576) and sixth in the number of weeks spent ranked No. 1 (54). Every four-year men's basketball letterman from 1973 to 2019 earned at least one trip to the NCAA basketball tournament.\nA 2019 study listed Indiana as the fifth most valuable collegiate basketball program in the country. Indiana has ranked in the top 20 nationally in men's basketball attendance every season since Assembly Hall opened in 1972, and often in the top five.\nIndiana has two main rivalries including in-state, against the Purdue Boilermakers (see Indiana–Purdue rivalry), and out-of-state, against the Kentucky Wildcats (see Indiana–Kentucky rivalry).\nTraditions.\nCandy striped warm-up pants.\nIndiana players wear warm-up pants that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first worn by the team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At the time they were in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, and a tribute to the Harlem Globetrotters who started the trend, but despite changing styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, \"As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. So when you finally got to put those on, those are pretty special.\" Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events.\nSimple game jerseys.\nThe team is widely noted for its simple game jerseys. Unlike most schools, Indiana does not have players' names on the back of jerseys that players wear on the court. The notion behind the nameless jerseys is that players play for the team name on the front, not the individual's name on the back. In keeping with Indiana's longstanding principle of putting team over player, the Hoosiers have never retired any jersey numbers. Adidas is the current outfitter of Indiana athletics.\nWhen coach Mike Davis succeeded Bob Knight, he suggested adding names to the jerseys. However, the Hoosiers' minimalist look had become such a part of the program's brand that the proposal was dropped after considerable backlash from fans. Despite the long tradition behind the jerseys, they have undergone some slight changes over the years. The school's colors are cream and crimson, but in the 1970s Knight and football coach Lee Corso started using uniforms that were more scarlet or bright red. During the same time, cream gave way almost universally to white. But those colors reverted mostly to cream and crimson in the early 2000s, after then-athletics director Michael McNeely decided that the team uniforms needed to reflect the school's official colors of cream and crimson.\n\"William Tell Overture\".\nDuring the third time-out of every second half, the Indiana Big Red Basketball Band performs the \"William Tell Overture\" with cheerleaders racing around the court carrying myriad flags that spell out \"Indiana Hoosiers.\" Indiana Assistant Director for Facilities, Chuck Crabb, said the tradition began in about 1979 or 1980. Sportscaster Billy Packer called it \"the greatest college timeout in the country.\"\n\"Mop Lady\" advertisement.\nIn 1971, Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance became the sole sponsor of Indiana and Purdue games on WTTV. During the mid-1970s, the State Farm Indiana Legends ads included a lady named \"Martha\" sweeping the floors of Assembly Hall while whistling and singing the school's fight song, \"Indiana, Our Indiana.\" It ran as the introduction to Indiana basketball broadcasts for 30 years. Upon Indiana's firing of Bob Knight, Farm Bureau pulled the ad. In 2009 new coach Tom Crean resurrected the tradition and had \"Martha\" appear at the \"Midnight Madness\" festivities to begin the season. Because the actress who had appeared in the original ads was unavailable, singer Sheila Stephen stepped in as the new Martha. Starting with the 2010–11 season, video of the original ad was shown at home games after the National Anthem and right before tip off. In recent years, the ad has been shown just before the Hoosiers take the court.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1900–1924).\nIndiana fielded its first men's basketball team in the 1900–01 season, posting a 1–4 ledger under coach James H. Horne. In their first game the Hoosiers traveled to Indianapolis and lost to Butler 17–20. Indiana's first victory was a 26–17 win over Wabash College that same year.\nIn 1917 the Hoosiers began playing their games at the Men's Gymnasium. After the first few games there, spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. Therefore, new backboards were installed that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass allowing fans to see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility (thus the Hoosiers were the first team) in the country to use glass backboards.\nEverett Dean era (1924–1938).\nIU's first great head coach, Everett Dean, was at first a standout player who garnered IU's first All-America honors in 1921. In 1924, Dean signed on as the full-time head coach of his alma mater. Under Dean, the Hoosiers would elevate their play to new heights, winning their first-ever share of the Big Ten Conference title in 1926, defeating Wisconsin 35–20. The Hoosiers also won conference championships in 1928 and 1936. Four All-Americans helped lead the Hoosiers in this era: Jim Strickland, Branch McCracken (later coach), Vern Huffman, and Ken Gunning. Dean coached Indiana until 1938. He is the only coach named to both the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Baseball Hall of Fame.\nBranch McCracken era (1938–1965).\nWhen Dean left for Stanford, the popular selection to succeed him was Branch McCracken. McCracken was another young alumnus and former player under Everett Dean. Because of his fast-breaking style of play, McCracken's teams would earn the nickname \"Hurryin' Hoosiers\".\nMcCracken's first IU team was led by All-American Ernie Andres, later a McCracken basketball assistant. In McCracken's first year, the team finished 17–3, splitting games with both Purdue and eventual NCAA runnerup Ohio State. The following year the 1939–40 NCAA title team, led by All-American Marvin Huffman, would take Indiana to unprecedented success: an NCAA title and a record (at the time) 20 wins. The 20–3 record by that team would not be bested for another 13 years until broken again by Indiana. At their home court at The Fieldhouse, Indiana saw six perfect seasons including a 24-game unbeaten home winning streak from 1938 to 1941. In 1948, McCracken was responsible for recruiting Bill Garrett who became the first African American player in Big Ten varsity basketball history.\nThe Hoosiers' 1952–53 NCAA title team – led by Bobby Leonard, Dick Farley, and three-time All-American Don Schlundt – won the Big Ten and went on to win the NCAA championship by defeating reigning champions Kansas by one point. The Hoosiers would again win the Big Ten the following season in 1953–54. Just a few years later the team won back-to-back conference championships in 1956–57 and 1957–58 behind the leadership of two-time All-American Archie Dees. A few years later the Hoosiers were led by two-time All-American Walt Bellamy, one of the few African-American players in college basketball at the time.\nIn the fall of 1960 the Indiana Hoosiers football program was hit with devastating NCAA sanctions that impacted every varsity sport at the school, including basketball. Although the violations only occurred within the football program, all Hoosier varsity sports were barred from postseason play during the probationary period. The sanctions drastically undermined the ability of coaches to lure talented players to Indiana. Nevertheless, McCracken did manage to successfully recruit twins Dick Van Arsdale and Tom Van Arsdale, both of whom would earn All-America honors in 1965.\nMcCracken ultimately coached IU for 23 years, amassing 364 wins and 210 Big Ten wins. His teams also won four regular season Big Ten titles and went to the NCAA tournament four times, winning two national titles. He was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame and the court now at Assembly Hall is named in his honor.\nLou Watson era (1965–1971).\nSandwiched between two iconic coaches in Branch McCracken and Bob Knight, McCracken's longtime assistant and former lead scorer Lou Watson coached Indiana from 1965 through 1971, with a leave of absence in 1970 where Jerry Oliver stepped in as acting head coach. The 1966–67 team, which won a Big Ten championship, was known as the \"Cardiac Kids\" because of their many heart-stopping finishes. During the 1970–1971 season the Hoosiers were led by All-American George McGinnis. Watson ended his Indiana coaching career with a 61–60 record.\nBob Knight era (1971–2000).\nDuring Bob Knight's 29 years as head coach at Indiana, the Hoosiers won 662 games, including 22 seasons of 20 or more wins, while losing but 239, a remarkable .735 winning percentage. In 24 NCAA tournament appearances at Indiana, Hoosier teams under Bob Knight won 42 of 63 games (.667), winning titles in 1975–76, 1980–81, and 1986–87, while finishing third in 1973 and 1992. While at Indiana, a total of 23 different players under Coach Knight's tutelage received All-American and All-Big Ten honors. For 10-consecutive seasons, a player made the All-American Academic and All-Big Ten Academic Teams, and a total of 18 players were so honored. Nine Indiana players won 10 Big Ten Most Valuable Player honors.\nIn 1972–73, Knight's second year as coach, Indiana won the Big Ten championship and reached the Final Four, but lost to UCLA. The following season, 1973–74, Indiana once again captured a Big Ten title. In the two following seasons, 1974–75 and 1975–76, the Hoosiers were undefeated in the regular season and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games, including two more Big Ten championships. The 1974–75 Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in an 83–82 win against Purdue they lost consensus All-American forward Scott May to a broken left arm. With May's injury keeping him to 7 minutes of play, the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to Kentucky 92–90 in the Mideast Regional. The Hoosiers were so dominant that four starters – Scott May, Steve Green, Kent Benson and Quinn Buckner – would make the five-man All-Big Ten team. The following season, 1975–76, the Hoosiers went the entire season and 1976 NCAA tournament without a single loss, beating Michigan 86–68 in the title game. Indiana remains the last school to accomplish this feat.\nBehind the play of Mike Woodson Indiana won the 1979 NIT championship. The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by Woodson and Isiah Thomas, won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen. The following season, in 1980–81, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the 1981 NCAA tournament, the school's fourth national title. In 1982–1983, with the strong play of Uwe Blab and All-Americans Ted Kitchel and Randy Wittman, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to Kitchel mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, when the team ultimately won the Big Ten title, he ordered that a banner be hung for the team in Assembly Hall as a tribute to the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the 1983 Sweet Sixteen.\nThe 1985–86 Hoosiers were profiled in a best-selling book \"A Season on the Brink\". To write it Knight granted author John Feinstein almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life. The following season, in 1986–87, the Hoosiers were led by All-American Steve Alford and captured a share of the Big Ten title. The team won Indiana's fifth national championship against Syracuse in the 1987 NCAA tournament with a game-winning jump shot by Keith Smart with five seconds of play remaining in the championship game. In the 1988–1989 season the Hoosiers were led by All-American Jay Edwards and won a Big Ten championship.\nFrom 1990 to 1991 through 1992–93, the Hoosiers posted 87 victories, the most by any Big Ten team in a three-year span, breaking the mark of 86 set by Knight's Indiana teams of 1974–76. Teams from these three seasons spent all but two of the 53 poll weeks in the top 10, and 38 of them in the top 5. They captured two Big Ten crowns in 1990–91 and 1992–93, and during the 1991–92 season reached the Final Four. During the 1992–93 season, the 31–4 Hoosiers finished the season at the top of the AP Poll, but were defeated by Kansas in the Elite Eight. Teams from this era included Greg Graham, Pat Knight, All-Americans Damon Bailey and Alan Henderson, and National Player of the Year Calbert Cheaney.\nThroughout the mid and late 1990s Knight and the Hoosiers continued to experience success with superior play from All-Americans Brian Evans and A. J. Guyton. The Hoosiers won a minimum of 19 games and played in the NCAA tournament each year. However, 1993 would be Knight's last conference championship and 1994 would be his last trip to the Sweet Sixteen. Moreover, his aggressive and combative actions and communication often brought as much controversy to the school as success. Allegations of abuse, along with his reputation and a strained relationship with then-University President Myles Brand, resulted in Knight's controversial dismissal in 2000.\nMike Davis era (2000–2006).\nFollowing Bob Knight's tumultuous exit from Indiana, assistant Mike Davis took over as interim head coach in the fall of 2000. In his first season, Davis led a team featuring All-Americans Kirk Haston and Jared Jeffries to a 21–13 record. The following year, in the 2001–02 season, Davis was named the permanent coach. That year the Hoosiers captured a share of the Big Ten championship and made an unexpected trip to the 2002 NCAA championship game. But after the Hoosiers failed to make the NCAA tournament in 2004 and 2005 (for the first time since 1985), criticism of Davis grew. Following months of speculation, he announced his resignation in February 2006, saying the basketball program needed to move on with a new coach. He remained with the team for the rest of the 2006 season before leaving.\nKelvin Sampson era (2006–2008).\nOn March 28, 2006, Oklahoma head coach Kelvin Sampson was named coach of the Hoosiers, despite a history of violating NCAA rules and sanctions imposed on him. Sampson fielded competitive teams and scored a major recruiting victory by persuading in-state star Eric Gordon to sign with Indiana. The Hoosiers, with Gordon and forward D.J. White, were considered one of the better teams during the 2007–2008 season. However, in October 2007 Sampson was found to have violated rules again, this time by engaging in a 3-way phone conversation with a recruit. Indiana punished Sampson by denying him a previously scheduled $500,000 raise, firing one of his assistant coaches, and taking away one of his scholarships for the 2008–2009 season.\nIn early February 2008 the NCAA informed Indiana that Sampson had \"knowingly violated telephone recruiting restrictions and then lied about it.\" After launching another internal investigation, Indiana officials announced just 14 days later that Sampson accepted a $750,000 buyout of his contract and resigned as the men's basketball coach. Former player and assistant coach Dan Dakich was named interim coach for the remainder of the season. A number of college basketball pundits believed that Sampson's tenure at Indiana had effectively ended once the allegations broke. \"Sports Illustrated\" college basketball columnist Seth Davis noted that the NCAA had given Indiana 90 days to respond to the notice of allegations. Indiana officials said their internal investigation would only take a week, leading Davis to believe that they had already decided Sampson was guilty. ESPN's Mark Schlabach suggested that the only reason Indiana did not fire Sampson right away was because his contract did not allow the school to suspend him immediately. He believed Indiana was trying to find a way not to honor his contract and stay out of the courtroom. ESPN's Pat Forde said that Sampson's departure was \"preordained\" the moment the NCAA sent out its notice of allegations, and suggested that Sampson would never return to Division I.\nIn November 2008, the NCAA imposed a three-year probation on the basketball program and upheld the school's self-imposed sanctions stemming from the actions of Sampson and his staff. Earlier, IU president Michael McRobbie privately told the NCAA infractions committee that Sampson betrayed his trust as Indiana's coach, and demonstrated that his hiring had been \"a risk that should not have been taken.\"\nTom Crean era (2008–2017).\nOn April 1, 2008, Tom Crean was hired as head coach and inherited a thoroughly depleted team. Between Crean's hiring and the start of the 2008–09 season, freshman Eric Gordon opted to leave early for the NBA and star forward DJ White graduated. Two other players transferred, one player was dismissed from the team and two others previously dismissed by Dakich were not allowed to return. As a result, Crean began with a roster consisting of two walk-ons who had scored a combined 36 points in their careers. Crean's first three seasons saw losing records of 6–25 (the worst in school history), 10–21, and 12–20.\nThe 2011–2012 season was a watershed one for Crean and the program. The arrival of Indiana Mr. Basketball Cody Zeller brought higher expectations for year four. The team earned wins over the #1 ranked Kentucky, the #2 ranked Ohio State, and #5 ranked Michigan State. This made Indiana the first Big 10 program to knock off the #1 and #2 ranked teams in the same season since 1991 and the first IU squad ever to defeat three programs ranked in the top five in the regular season. The Hoosiers finished the season with a 27–9 record, 5th in the Big Ten. The fifteen game win improvement in 2011–2012 was the largest single turnaround in the NCAA that season. Crean's guidance of the program to success from \"unthinkable depths\" was regarded as one of the most remarkable rebuilding projects in NCAA basketball history. The Hoosiers advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2012 NCAA tournament before losing a rematch game to Kentucky, who would go on to win the national championship. Following the surprise run to the Sweet Sixteen, the 2012–2013 Hoosiers spent 10 weeks ranked No. 1 in the country, and all but two weeks in the top 5. The experience of Jordan Hulls and Christian Watford, alongside the talent of Victor Oladipo, Cody Zeller and freshman point guard Yogi Ferrell, led this team to a finish of outright Big Ten regular season champions for the first time since 2002. They again advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, the first time since the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons that the Hoosiers advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in back-to-back seasons. As national player of the year, Oladipo and Zeller both left for the NBA after the conclusion of the season.\nAfter a rough start, the 2015–2016 Hoosiers finished the season 27–8 overall and 15–3 in the Big Ten to win the Big Ten regular season title outright. They received the #1 seed in the 2016 Big Ten men's basketball tournament, where they made an early quarterfinals exit. As Big Ten Conference Champions, the Hoosiers received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and beat Chattanooga and Kentucky to advance to the Sweet 16 for the third time in five years; however, they fell to North Carolina in the next round. Despite the highs of the previous season and being ranked as high as #3 in the nation, the 2016–2017 team faced a troubling and disappointing year; they finished 18–16 overall and 7–11 in Big Ten play. After tying for tenth in the Big Ten, the Hoosiers missed out on the NCAA tournament and lost in the first round of the NIT, their first appearance since 2005. On March 16, 2017, the Indiana Hoosiers Athletic's Department fired coach Tom Crean. He ended his tenure with the Hoosiers with an overall record of 166–135 (.551), three Sweet Sixteen appearances, and two regular season conference championships.\nArchie Miller era (2017–2021).\nOn March 27, 2017, Archie Miller was named the 29th head coach in the history of the men's basketball program. Miller's first season was a major remodeling job, starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense, 25% offense. That scheme showed early and often, as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense, despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball. With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten tournament to Rutgers, 67–76, and losing enough games to keep them out of both the NCAA tournament and NIT, including games in which they were favored, such as Indiana State and Fort Wayne, IU's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close. They finished with an overall record of 16–15 and 9–9 in the Big Ten.\nIn 2018, Miller landed his first five star recruit when Romeo Langford committed to Indiana University. Langford, a McDonald's-All American and 2018 Indiana Mr. Basketball, was (according to ESPN) the 6th ranked player in the nation and number one high school player in Indiana. Despite getting off to a strong start of 12–2, which included 3 conference wins, the 2018–2019 Hoosiers struggled down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and the inability to shoot, IU lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a 4-game winning streak. Having put themselves back into the conversation for making the NCAA tournament for the first time in 3 years, the Hoosiers looked to knock off Ohio State in the Big Ten tournament. However, the Hoosiers fell short and lost to Ohio State, 75–79. IU was deemed one of the Last Four Out in the NCAA tournament, so they earned 1-seed in the NIT, where they advanced to the Quarterfinals before losing to Wichita State, 63–73. Thus, the Hoosiers' 119th season ended with an overall record of 19–16 and 8–12 in the Big Ten. The Hoosiers started off another strong campaign for the 2019–2020 season by going 11–1 before dropping back-to-back games in late December 2019 and early January 2020. During the bulk of the conference season, IU was able to win most of their home games (7–3), while stealing a few road games (2-8) to end their final season with an overall record of 20–12 and a conference record of 9–11. Indiana entered the Big Ten tournament as the 11-seed where they faced the 14-seeded Nebraska Cornhuskers. The first round matchup ended in an 89–64 IU victory, staging a second round matchup with 6-seed Penn State. However, on the morning of March 12, 2020, the Big Ten Conference announced that it would be cancelling the remaining tournament games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following suit, that afternoon, the NCAA announced that it was cancelling all winter and spring championships. This announcement officially, and abruptly, ended the Hoosiers' season, where they were expected to make the NCAA tournament for the first time in 4 years.\nThe 2020–21 season was another disappointing one as the Hoosiers finished the regular season 12–15 overall, 7–12 in the Big Ten. Indiana closed out the season on a 6-game losing streak, leaving them out of the NCAA and NIT tournaments. On March 15, 2021, Indiana University officially parted ways with Miller and began its search for the next men's head basketball coach.\nMike Woodson era (2021–Current).\nJust shy of two weeks after Archie Miller was fired, Indiana University announced on March 28, 2021, that former Indiana standout, Mike Woodson, would become the 30th head coach of the IU basketball program. In addition, former Ohio State head coach, Thad Matta, was hired on to be an associate athletic director in men's basketball administration.\nCoach Woodson's first season at the helm saw a list of streaks come to an end for the Hoosiers. Indiana finished the season 21–14 overall, and 9–11 in conference play. Along the way, IU ended losing streaks to Purdue, Michigan, and Illinois. as the No. 9 seed, they also advanced to the semifinals of the Big Ten Conference tournament, something they had not done since 2013. They lost to Iowa, 77–80, the eventual tournament champions. The Hoosiers also heard their name called on Selection Sunday for the first time since 2016. After a six-year absence from the NCAA tournament, IU was selected as a No. 12 seed to play in the NCAA tournament First Four round in Dayton, Ohio. They knocked off No. 12 seed Wyoming to make it to the first round (Round of 64) where they lost to No. 5 seed St. Mary's.\nThe Hoosiers finished the '22-'23 regular season ranked No. 19 in the Associated Press poll. The team spent 16 weeks among the top-25 teams in the nation. The Hoosiers also captured a share of 2nd place in the Big Ten Conference with a 21-10 overall regular season record, 12-8 in Big Ten play, and the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten Conference tournament. IU advanced to the quarterfinals before losing a close game to Penn State. For the second year in a row, the team found themselves in the NCAA Tournament this time as a No. 4 seed, where they improved upon their performance last year by making it to the Round of 32 but falling to the No. 5 seed Miami (FL), 69-85. Woodson's third season didn't meet expectations as the '23-'24 Hoosiers finished 19-14 overall and 10-10 in the Big Ten. IU received the No. 6 seed in the Big Ten Conference tournament, where they beat Penn State for the first time that season, 61-59 with a last second tip-in by Anthony Leal. In the quarterfinals, IU lost to Nebraska for the third time that season, 66-93.\nCurrent Roster.\nNote: Players' year is based on remaining eligibility. The NCAA did not count the 2020–21 season towards eligibility.\nFacilities.\nOld Assembly Hall (1900–1917).\nIndiana's first basketball home was the original Assembly Hall, and at the time it was known simply as the Men's Gymnasium. As a multi-purpose building it also hosted a number of other indoor sports and campus activities. The wood-frame structure was built in 1896 at a cost of $12,000 and had a seating capacity of 600, though many more would often pack inside to watch games. It was located on the east side of Owen Hall where a small Disabled Zone parking lot sits today on the south side of the Indiana Memorial Union building. The first basketball game was played on February 21, 1901, when Indiana lost to Butler 24–20. In March 1911 the gym hosted the first ever Indiana high school basketball tournament and was hosted by the IU Booster Club instead of the IHSAA. As basketball began to outgrow the facility, students went so far as to characterize the gym as a public menace and health risk. On January 13, 1917, Indiana played its final game in the gym with a win over Iowa State 29–13. The building was torn down in 1938.\nMen's Gymnasium (1917–1928).\nThe Men's Gymnasium served as the home of the basketball team from 1917 to 1928. After the first few games spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. As a result, the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new backboards that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards. Due to growing popularity of the sport at the school the team eventually had to move to a larger arena. The facility is now used by the School of Public Health-Bloomington (formerly the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, HPER).\nIU Fieldhouse (1928–1960).\nThe IU Fieldhouse (now known as the William Leon Garrett Fieldhouse, named after Bill Garrett) hosted the basketball team from 1928 to 1960. Indiana star player (and later coach) Branch McCracken scored the first point in the facility with a free throw. During the team's 32 seasons there, it hosted two national championship teams, five conference titles, 20 different All-Americans, and three Big Ten Most Valuable Players. However, the growing popularity of the sport necessitated a move to a new facility.\nNew IU Fieldhouse (1960–1971).\nThe New IU Fieldhouse (later named the Gladstein Fieldhouse) was originally intended as an interim home for the men's basketball team. However, NCAA sanctions on the football program hobbled the school's finances, and the \"New\" Fieldhouse ended up hosting the team for 11 years from 1960 to 1971. It now serves as a state-of-the-art track and field facility.\nSimon Skjodt Assembly Hall (1971–present).\nThe Hoosiers currently play at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall (pronounced like Scott). The 17,222-seat arena has been the home of the men's basketball team since 1972. The basketball floor is named Branch McCracken Court after the legendary Hoosier coach. The north end of the arena prominently displays the program's five national championship banners. Former head coach Bob Knight called the facility a \"sacred place\" for student fans and athletes. Basketball sportscaster Gus Johnson called Assembly Hall, \"the Carnegie Hall of basketball.\"\nCook Hall (2010–present).\nCook Hall is a basketball practice facility that was completed in 2010 and is located next to Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall, connected by a tunnel. Bill and Gayle Cook donated $15 million to the \"For the Glory of Old IU\" campaign, out of which came Cook Hall where the IU basketball team is able to engage in day-to-day operations. It contains the Pfau Shine Legacy Court, a museum space that chronicles the history of Indiana basketball with photographs, artifacts, trophies and interactive touch-screen kiosks. The 67,000-square-foot, three story facility features two practice courts, two locker rooms, two player lounges, a strength and conditioning area, coaches' offices, and meeting rooms.\nNotable players and coaches.\nIndiana does not retire numbers of former players, unlike many other college basketball programs.\n1,000-point scorers.\nThe Hoosiers currently have 53 players in their 1,000-point club.\nCalbert Cheaney is the all-time leading scorer at Indiana University with 2,613 points. Cheaney was able to reach the 1,000-point milestone in just 53 games, the 4th quickest Hoosier to do so. Others of honorable mention include Don Schlundt (43 games), Archie Dees (47 games), Walt Bellamy (50 games), Mike Woodson and Jimmy Rayl (54 games), Joe Cooke and Jay Edwards (55 games), Bracey Wright (59 games), and rounding out the top 10 is Tom Bolyard (60 games).\nAll-Americans.\nIndiana has a total of 46 players who have claimed All-American status, with 14 of them earning First-Team All-American.\n♦ Denotes Consensus First-Team All-American\nAcademic All-Americans.\nA total of 11 Hoosiers have been deemed Academic All-Americans.\nMcDonald's All-Americans.\nIndiana has recruited a total of 34 McDonald's All-Americans; the first coming in 1977 and the latest in 2024.\nIndiana Mr. Basketball.\n29 Indiana Mr. Basketball honorees have played for Indiana.\nCoaching honors.\nNational Coach of the Year\nBig Ten Coach of the Year\nBig Ten Conference honors.\nBig Ten Player of the Year\nBig Ten Freshman of the Year\nSchool records.\nRecord vs. Big Ten opponents.\nUpdated March 16, 2024\nPostseason appearances.\nIndiana has won five NCAA Championships in men's basketball (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987) — the first two under coach Branch McCracken and the latter three under Bob Knight — and 22 Big Ten Conference championships. The Hoosiers' five NCAA Championships are tied with Duke (5) for the fourth-most in history, trailing only UCLA (11), Kentucky (8), North Carolina and UConn (6). Their eight trips to the Final Four ranks eighth (tied) on the all-time list. The Hoosiers have made 41 appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament (sixth-most in NCAA history).

        "text": "Leroy Jones (September 29, 1950June 11, 2021) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end. He played the majority of his 11-year career with the San Diego Chargers (now Los Angeles) in the National Football League (NFL).\nJones played both basketball and football in high school, and continued with both sports while attending college at Norfolk State University. He began his professional career in 1973 with the Edmonton Eskimos (now the Elks) in the Canadian Football League (CFL), where he spent three seasons. Jones was selected in the second round of the 1975 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, who traded him in 1976 to San Diego, where he played through 1983.\nEarly life.\nJones was born and raised in Greenwood, Mississippi. He already stood in the seventh grade. At Amanda Elzy High School, he was a standout at both football and basketball, leading his teams to multiple championships. In 2011, \"The Greenwood Commonwealth\" named him one of the top 25 sports figures in the Greenwood area's history.\nCollege career.\nJones attended Norfolk State University after being recruited by a coach who was a Greenwood native. Jones was the center on three Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) tournament basketball teams. He was named to the All-CIAA Tournament team each year. As a sophomore in 1972, he was named to the Associated Press All-State first-team, and was named to the second-team as a junior.\nJones also played football for the Spartans, and he was named All-CIAA as a defensive end in 1971 and 1972. Before the 1973 football season, he learned that he would be academically ineligible to play due to poor grades. Jones dropped out of Norfolk State and signed a three-year contract to play football professionally in Canada. In 1983, he was a member of the inaugural class of Norfolk State's sports hall of fame.\nProfessional career.\nJones joined the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as a taxi squad member in 1973, before being placed on a five-day tryout prior to the 61st Grey Cup. The following year, he led the team in tackles and sacks that season, as well as in the 62nd Grey Cup championship game.\nHaving left Norfolk State early, Jones was not eligible for the 1974 NFL draft. In the summer of 1973, pro scouts had projected him as a first-round pick in 1974, rating him near or on par with Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones, who became the first overall pick in 1974. Ruled eligible for the 1975 NFL draft, Leroy Jones was selected in the second round by the Los Angeles Rams with the 48th overall pick. He became the highest-drafted player in Norfolk State football history. Jones reportedly wanted to play for the Rams, but the Eskimos had an option year remaining on his contract. He missed the start of Edmonton's training camp before reporting three days later. In 1975, the Eskimos placed him on the injured reserve list in October. He was cut in November before the Western Football Conference championship game while still on the injured list. Edmonton won the 63rd Grey Cup that season with Bill Stevenson taking over Jones' former position at left defensive end.\nThe San Diego Chargers acquired Jones from the Rams in 1976 for a future draft choice. In 1980, he teamed with All-Pros Fred Dean, Gary \"Big Hands\" Johnson, and Louie Kelcher on the defensive line as the Chargers led the NFL in sacks (60). The foursome was nicknamed the Bruise Brothers. Jones that season had 12 sacks, second on the team behind Johnson's , and was named an alternate for the Pro Bowl. Don \"Air\" Coryell's Chargers teams of that era are mostly remembered for their high-scoring, pass-oriented offense. The Chargers won the AFC West from 1979–1981 and also qualified for the playoffs in 1982.\nDuring the 1981 season, Jones blocked a 35-yard field goal by Miami kicker Uwe von Schamann at 11:27 into overtime, allowing San Diego to drive for its own field goal and win 41–38 in the playoff game known as the Epic in Miami, considered by many to be among the greatest NFL games ever. Jones played as a backup in his final season in 1983. He ended his career ranked third all-time in Chargers' history in career sacks with .\nPersonal life.\nJones died at age 70 on June 11, 2021, in Casselberry, Florida."

He played both college football and basketball for the Lamar Cardinals. He was a member of the Dolphins' undefeated team in 1972.\nEarly years.\nMoore attended Charlton-Pollard High School. He played defensive end for Texas High School Hall of Fame coach Willie Ray Smith Sr. and was a teammate of Smith's son, Bubba Smith. He also was a forward in basketball, helping his team win the Prairie View Interscholastic League state championship in 1964.\nHe accepted a basketball scholarship to play at Lamar University in his hometown, under coach Jack Martin.

Over his career, he played in three Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) with the Dolphins and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1973.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his retirement, Moore became a salesman for a construction company. On August 19, 1989, two days after his 44th birthday, he suffered a heart attack at his home in Miami and was pronounced dead at Coral Reef Hospital that afternoon."

        "title": "BYU Cougars men's basketball",
        "text": "The BYU Cougars men's basketball team represents Brigham Young University in NCAA Division I basketball play. Established in 1902, the team has won 27 conference championships, 3 conference tournament championships and 2 NIT Tournaments (1951 and 1966), and competed in 30 NCAA tournaments. It currently competes in the Big 12 Conference. From 1999 to 2011, the team competed in the Mountain West Conference, followed by 12 seasons in the West Coast Conference. On September 10, 2021, the Big 12 Conference unanimously accepted BYU's application for membership, and BYU officially joined the conference for the 2023–24 season. The team is coached by Kevin Young.\nHistory.\nBYU fielded its first basketball team in 1903. In 1906, the Cougars played their first game against Utah State University. In 1909, the team first played against the University of Utah. These two rivalries continue to this day. In its 108-year history, BYU's basketball program has won 1,786 games, ranking 12th among all Division I programs. The Cougars won the first of their 27 conference championships in 1922 as a member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference led by star point guard River Jeffcoat.\nThe Cougars made the first of their 29 NCAA tournament appearances in 1950 under head coach Stan Watts. That Cougars came within one point of reaching the national semifinals. BYU's 1951 team was even more successful, winning 28 games and once again qualifying for the NCAA tournament. In addition, the 1951 team won the first of two NIT championships for the school. The Cougars defeated AP No. 9 St. John's, AP #10 St. Louis and AP #13 Dayton to win the title. Notable players on that team include: Mel Hutchins, who was taken #2 in the 1951 NBA draft, was named the 1951–52 NBA co-rookie of the year and became a 5-time NBA All-Star with the Pistons and the Knicks; Roland Minson, who was drafted #16 overall in the 1951 NBA draft; and Loren C. Dunn, a future general authority in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Cougars would go on to make five more appearances in the NCAA tournament under Watts, and win their second NIT championship in 1966, although by that time the overall prestige of the NIT had fallen considerably. BYU has the most NCAA appearances of any men's team not to make the Final Four, having made thirty NCAA tournaments. BYU, alongside Xavier, Saint Joseph's, Boston College, Arizona State, and Davidson are each tied for second most in Elite Eight appearances without a Final Four with three (Missouri has the most with five). \nUnder Watts, BYU also became the first U.S. college basketball program to include an international player on its roster, as Finland native Timo Lampen debuted in the 1958–59 season. Later, BYU's Krešimir Ćosić, born in Yugoslavia (modern-day Croatia), became the first international player to be named an All-American. His jersey was retired in the Marriott Center in March 2006 in the last home game of the season against the New Mexico Lobos. Watts retired as the winningest coach in BYU history.\nAfter Watts' retirement following the 1972 season, the program experienced five consecutive losing seasons from 1974 through 1978 before returning to the NCAA tournament in 1979 behind Danny Ainge and coach Frank Arnold. The Cougars reached the Elite Eight, one game short of the Final Four, in 1981, Ainge's senior season. That season, Ainge won the Wooden Award as the nation's most outstanding player.\nArnold left following the 1983 season and was replaced by LaDell Andersen, who had several successful seasons in the 1980s, including the 1987–88 season when the Cougars rose as high as #3 in the national rankings on their way to a 26–6 season. Andersen then resigned following a 14–15 season in 1989. He was replaced by Roger Reid, who guided the Cougars to 20-win seasons in each of his first six years and five NCAA tournament appearances.\nReid was fired in the middle of the 1996–97 season after a 1–6 start. Part of his firing had to do with a private comment Reid made to Chris Burgess, then considered the top high school player in the nation and a Latter-day Saint whose father had attended BYU; Reid suggested that Burgess had let down the entire church by choosing to attend Duke rather than BYU. Assistant coach Tony Ingle coached the team on an interim basis for the rest of the season and did not win a game; the Cougars' 1–25 record was the first time the school failed to reach 5 wins in a season.\nFollowing the season, Steve Cleveland was hired as the new head coach and returned the Cougars to prominence. In 2001, the Cougars won the MWC regular season and tournament championships, making their first NCAA tournament appearance since 1995. After the 2004–05 season, Cleveland resigned to become the head coach at Fresno State; he was replaced by Dave Rose.\nDave Rose, co-captain of the University of Houston's 1983 \"Phi Slama Jama\" college basketball team, began the first of six straight 20-win seasons in 2005–06. Rose and assistant Dave Rice continued BYU's successful recruiting with the addition of All-American Jimmer Fredette in 2007 and DeMarcus Harrison in 2011. In June 2009, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and returned to coaching later that year. In 2010, Rose coached BYU to their first NCAA tournament victory in 17 years in a double-overtime win against the University of Florida. The following year, BYU made further inroads as a #3 seed when they advanced to the Sweet 16. On March 13, 2012, BYU set a record for the largest comeback in an NCAA tournament game, as they were down by 25 points at one point in their first game of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and came back to beat the Iona Gaels 78–72.\nFollowing Tyler Haws' departure for an overseas professional career, Kyle Collinsworth became the Cougars' recognized leader, setting the NCAA record for career triple doubles and earning WCC Player of the Year honors as a senior. Since Collinsworth's departure, the Cougars have struggled, especially in the postseason. The program was dealt an additional blow when the NCAA announced penalties against the Cougars due to an alleged benefits scandal surrounding shooting guard Nick Emery. As part of those sanctions, BYU was ordered to vacate all victories where Nick Emery played over two seasons (a total of 47 wins). The BYU athletics department has appealed the decision. An official BYU athletics department statement (not attributed to a specific employee) read in part, “The vacation-of-records penalty is extremely harsh and unprecedented given the details of the case. For more than two decades, the NCAA has not required an institution to vacate games in similar cases where the COI found there was no institutional knowledge of or involvement in the violation by either the coaching staff or other university personnel. In fact, this sanction includes the most severe vacation-of-record penalty ever imposed in the history of NCAA Division I basketball for infractions that included no institutional knowledge or involvement. In addition, in the case most similar to this situation, appropriate penalties were imposed, but no wins were vacated. BYU believes the vacating of its game record penalty is unfair and not consistent with recent NCAA precedent.”\nOn March 26, 2019, after thirteen seasons as head coach at BYU, Dave Rose announced his retirement. On April 10, 2019, BYU athletics director Tom Holmoe announced that Mark Pope, a former assistant at BYU under Rose and head coach of the Utah Valley University men's basketball team, had been hired as Rose's replacement.\nOn July 23, 2019, Nick Emery announced that he was retiring from college basketball. He cited unspecified challenges in his career that led to the decision.\nPope led a turnaround for the program in his first two seasons, with his inaugural season led by a trio of seniors in Yoeli Childs, T.J. Haws (younger brother of Tyler), and Jake Toolson. The team finished that season 24–8 and was projected to be a lock for the NCAA tournament as a single-digit seed before all postseason play was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020–21 season was projected to be a rebuilding year due to the loss of Childs, Haws, and Toolson to graduation, but Pope revamped the team in the offseason. Joining returning senior guard Alex Barcello was graduate transfers Brandon Averette and Matt Haarms. The 2020–21 team finished the regular season 20–6 and made the NCAA tournament as a No. 6 seed, the first appearance in the tournament since the 2014–15 season.\nSeason-by-season results.\nUnder Kevin Young:\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nBYU has made the NCAA tournament 30 times, with the Cougars having a record of 15–34.\nNIT.\nBYU has made the National Invitation Tournament fifteen times, going 19–13.

Beach tennis offers a highly aerobic cardio workout with low impact to the knees and joints because it is played on sand.\nThe sport preserves most of the rules and scoring of traditional tennis, though modifications have been made to adapt to movement around the sand court and to the faster pace of the game. As the ball may not touch the ground, the game is played entirely with volleys, which makes for a quicker game than does traditional tennis. Points start with a serve and end when the ball touches the ground, forcing players to dive to reach difficult plays in a similar manner used by volleyball players. The objective is to return the ball with only one hit so that it reaches the opposing side of the net.\nA depressurized tennis ball, which travels more slowly through the air than does a regulation tennis ball, is used for beach tennis to allow for longer rallies. The sport is usually played by two-person teams on a regulation beach-volleyball court with a 5-foot-7-inch-high net.\nHistory.\nBeach tennis emerged in Italy in the early 1970s when tennis players on vacation in Lido degli Estensi, in the Ferrara town of Comacchio, played using their rackets and the existing volleyball nets already installed on the beach. The game was played for the first time with its current set of rules in Torredembarra, Spain in 1976. The first championship was played in Torredembarra in 1978. Since then (with few interruptions), it takes place on the same beach every year. Over the years, the sport spread to the beaches along the coast of Italy, and it is estimated that there are now more than 1,600 beach-tennis nets along the Italian coast in addition to a growing number of inland and indoor courts. There are an estimated 250,000 Italian beach tennis players.\nThe international spread.\nBeach tennis arrived on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro around 2008, and the sport now dominates about one-third of the beach-volleyball courts along the Brazilian coast, and there are more than 50,000 beach tennis players in Brazil. Most Brazilian tennis clubs have converted, or are converting, at least one traditional tennis court into a few beach-tennis courts.\nThough originally played only on beaches, beach tennis is now played at tennis clubs, indoor beach tennis/volleyball warehouses, country clubs, resorts, gyms and sand arenas.\nSome believe that the sport is entering its golden age following its recognition by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in 2010. The ITF now manages the most well-known and reputable international ranking of beach-tennis players. The ITF is allocating resources to the development of the sport and has set up exposition sand courts at professional tennis tournaments such as the Japan Open, Roland-Garros, the Australian Open and the US Open.\nTop tennis players who have played beach tennis include Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Andy Murray, the Bryan brothers, Rafael Nadal and Gustavo Kuerten.\nThe ITF also supports beach tennis by sanctioning tournaments. In 2013, the ITF began to organize regional and world championships. By 2015, 89 official sanctioned tournaments were held worldwide annually, and thousands more unofficial tournaments are held around the world each year. In 2015 the Pan-American games were held in Santos, São Paulo, Brazil, with participants from 16 countries. Also in 2015, a team championship tournament was held in Moscow with participants from 28 countries, with adult, junior, male and female teams\nIn the United States.\nBeach tennis was formalized in the United States in 2005 by Marc Altheim, who discovered the sport on a trip to Aruba in 2003. The sport had been played there since 2000, having been introduced by a Dutchman. As of 2007, beach tennis had made progress toward acceptance as a mainstream sport, with an official standards organization known as Beach Tennis USA (BT USA). In 2007, BT USA reached television deals with the Tennis Channel and SNY, but the organization is no longer active. The Beach Tennis Association currently maintains player rankings and operates tournaments in Southern California."

        "text": "The 2007 Phillips 66 Big 12 Men's Basketball Championship was the 2007 edition of the Big 12 Conference's championship tournament held at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City from March 8 until March 11, 2007. The tournament ended in an 88–84 overtime victory by the #1 seed Kansas Jayhawks over the #3 seed Texas Longhorns, and was the first Big 12 tournament ever to end in an overtime game.\nRegular season/Tournament seeding.\nIn the first preseason poll, Kansas was picked first and received 11 first-place votes. Texas A&amp;M was picked second and received one first-place vote. The rest of the voting was as follows: Oklahoma State was picked third, Texas fourth, Kansas State fifth, Texas Tech sixth, Baylor seventh, Missouri eighth, Oklahoma ninth, Iowa State tenth, Nebraska eleventh, and Colorado twelfth. As preseason polls predicted, Kansas did win the regular-season title, clinching it outright with a 90–86 win over Texas on March 3. Thus, the seedings for the tournament were earned as follows, with tiebreaker procedures followed in breaking a four-way tie for seventh place between Oklahoma State, Iowa State, Oklahoma, and Nebraska (see Tie-Breaking Procedures for more information on seeding in the tournament).\nSource:\n† – Denotes Tournament Champion.\n * – Denotes Regular Season Champion\nTournament.\nChampionship game.\nIn a flip-flopping game, Texas charged out of the box to gain an early lead of 32–10. Kansas, however, went on a 24–7 run to cut the Texas lead to 39–34 at the half. The lead then switched to Kansas early in the second half, but a rally by Texas pulled them ahead 73–71 in the final minutes. However, one missed free throw by Texas' Craig Winder allowed a Kansas three-pointer by Mario Chalmers to tie the game with 15 seconds left. In overtime, Kansas was up five with 15.3 seconds left, but a Texas three-pointer by A. J. Abrams cut the lead to two. It took two free throws by Kansas' Darnell Jackson with just over five seconds left to seal the win, 88–84. Durant actually had a chance to score for the win in the second half, but missed the jump shot. He, however, led the game with 37 points. Kansas' Sherron Collins followed with 20. The game is the biggest comeback in Kansas basketball history, eclipsing a 19-point comeback over UCLA in December 1995.\nTournament summary.\nThis was the first Big 12 Basketball Tournament to end with an overtime game. With the win, Kansas moved to 5–1 in the championship game, while Texas fell to 0–4. The 22-point comeback by the Jayhawks in the championship was the biggest in the tournament's history. The second-biggest occurred in the same tournament, when Texas came back from 18 down to defeat the Baylor Bears. This tournament was home to the lowest score in tournament history (39 by Nebraska against Oklahoma State), as well as the highest combined score (180 points in the Missouri-Baylor first-round game).\nThe Tournament MVP was Kevin Durant, a freshman from the University of Texas, who was a member of the 2007 Big 12 All-Tournament Team with Brandon Rush (Kansas), A. J. Abrams (Texas), Curtis Jerrells (Baylor), and Julian Wright (Kansas). Durant also scored 92 points to surpass the previous Big 12 tournament record of 79 set by Marcus Fizer in 2000.\nThis edition of the tournament was the first to be played in Oklahoma City; previous tournaments had been played in Kansas City, Missouri or Dallas, Texas. The tournament final was televised by ESPN with play-by-play and commentary by Ron Franklin, Fran Fraschilla, and Holly Rowe.\nAll-Tournament Team.\nMost Outstanding Player – Kevin Durant, \"Texas\""

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2008 proceeded according to revised rules enacted in 2001 and further revamped in 2007. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from among recent players, resulting in the induction of Goose Gossage. A restructured format for Veterans Committee voting resulted in the first successful election by that body since 2001, with five candidates earning induction, after the three elections in the intervening years had failed to produce any inductees. Selected by the Veterans Committee were former managers Billy Southworth and Dick Williams, and former executives Barney Dreyfuss, Bowie Kuhn, and Walter O'Malley.\nInitially, the Veterans Committee was not scheduled to hold an election; the 2001 rules changes provided that elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives) held every fourth year. The Committee voted in 2007 in both areas, and an election for players was next held in 2009. Under the 2001 rules, the next election for non-players would have been conducted in 2011; however, the 2007 changes meant that elections of non-players would now be conducted for inductions in even-numbered years beginning in 2008, with managers and umpires elected from one ballot and executives from a separate ballot.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were held on July 27, with Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig presiding. This was to be the final year that the annual Hall of Fame Game, an exhibition contest played in Cooperstown, would be held; however, the game was rained out.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1988 or later, but not after 2002; the ballot, announced on November 26, 2007, included candidates from the 2007 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2002. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2008 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 8. The ballot consisted of 25 players, and over 575 ballots were distributed; they had to be returned by December 31, and votes were tabulated by BBWAA official Jack O'Connell along with Michael DiLecce, a partner in the Ernst &amp; Young accounting firm. 543 ballots were cast (including 3 ballots which supported no candidates), two short of the record total of 2007, with 408 votes required for election. A total of 2,907 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.35 per ballot. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). Fourteen candidates returned from the 2007 ballot. The candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nDave Concepción was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 17 All-Stars, eight of whom were not included on the ballot, with only one (Tim Raines, with seven) who was selected more than five times. In contrast to the remarkably deep field of candidates in 2007, when those newly eligible had been named to the All-Star team a combined total of 103 times, the 2008 field of new candidates were selected a total of only 43 times. José Rijo, who appeared on the 2001 ballot before returning to the major leagues in 2001–2002, again became eligible. Darryl Kile, who died during the season, was included on the 2003 ballot under a standard provision for players who die before the five-year waiting period has elapsed; this same provision allowed Rod Beck (who played his last game in 2004 but died in 2007) to appear on the 2008 ballot.\nThe ballot included two Rookie of the Year Award winners: David Justice and Chuck Knoblauch.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Luis Alicea, Alex Arias, Andy Benes, Mike Benjamin, Dennis Cook, Delino DeShields, Darrin Fletcher, Rich Garcés, Chris Haney, Dave Hollins, Bobby J. Jones, Tom Lampkin, Darren Lewis, Mike Magnante, Dave Mlicki, Mike Morgan, Hipólito Pichardo, Armando Reynoso, Henry Rodríguez, Lee Stevens, Greg Swindell, Mike Trombley, John Valentin, Randy Velarde, Ed Vosberg, and Mark Wohlers.\nOf the newly eligible candidates, the only one who amassed enough votes to remain on the BBWAA ballot was Raines. This contrasts with the 2007 voting, when Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn were inducted at the first opportunity, and two other newcomers, Mark McGwire and Harold Baines, received enough votes to remain on the ballot. McGwire, who received 128 votes in 2007, got the same number of votes in 2008. Baines, whose 29 votes in 2007 kept him on the ballot by two votes, lost one vote in 2008, remaining on the ballot with exactly the minimum requirement.\nAlso notable was Jim Rice falling short of election, this time by 16 votes. He was on the ballot for the 15th and final time in , finally earning induction that year alongside newcomer Rickey Henderson.\nVeterans Committee elections.\nThe Veterans Committee election process, radically changed in 2001, was revamped yet again in July 2007. The changes that most directly affected this election involved elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives). Under the 2001 rules, elections of non-players would be held every fourth year on a \"composite ballot\". No candidate was elected from the composite ballot in 2003 or 2007.\nWith the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was split into two separate ballots—one for managers and umpires and the other for executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was now reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters (only one of whom had been among the previous electorate). Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots will now take place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, starting with 2008. To be eligible, managers and umpires need to be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives need to be either retired or at least age 65.\nA Historical Overview Committee of eleven sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires; the committee members were: Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"), Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"), Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"), Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau), Moss Klein (Newark \"Star-Ledger\"), Bill Madden (New York \"Daily News\"), Ken Nigro (formerly \"Baltimore Sun\"), Jack O'Connell (MLB.com), Nick Peters (\"The Sacramento Bee\"), Tracy Ringolsby (\"Rocky Mountain News\") and Mark Whicker (\"The Orange County Register\"). The managers/umpires list was submitted to a 16-member panel composed of 10 Hall of Famers (8 players and 2 managers), 3 executives and 3 veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a 12-member panel including 7 executives, 2 players and 3 writers, which was the same committee which did the final voting in that area. On November 8, 2007, the final ballots were released. Each panel member could vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel would be elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions was possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville, Tennessee on December 2, 2007, with the results announced on December 3; it was the first time since 2001 that the Committee met to discuss candidates, as the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.\nManagers/umpires ballot.\nThe ballot for managers and umpires included seven managers (designated M) and three umpires (designated U), with 12 votes required for election. Candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in later elections are indicated in \"italics\".\nSouthworth, who won four National League titles between 1942 and 1948, and Williams, who won American League titles in 1967 and 1972–73 and an NL flag in 1984, had been the only eligible managers with at least four league pennants who had not yet been elected to the Hall; Southworth's 1,044 career victories, however, were the fewest by any manager yet elected. The committee members apparently made an effort to vote for as many candidates as they were allowed, casting at least 58 of a possible 64 individual votes (vote totals for four candidates were not released). Herzog, Martin, Williams and Harvey had previously been on the final composite ballot in the 2007 election. Four of the candidates were still living; at the time the ballot was released, Williams was 78, Harvey 77, Herzog a day shy of his 76th birthday, and Johnson 64. Harvey was the only manager or umpire on the ballot who received majority support in 2007, receiving 52 votes from the 81 committee members who voted that year. The leading vote-getter among managers in 2007 was Williams, who received 30 votes; Herzog was just behind at 29. Harvey and Herzog would both live to be inducted in .\nThe election committee, which was announced on the same day as the ballot, included:\nAt the induction ceremonies, St. Louis Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt gave the speech to accept Southworth's induction.\nExecutives ballot.\nOn the executives ballot, 9 votes were required for election; those candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics:\nDreyfuss, who owned the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1900 to 1932, and O'Malley, who owned the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1950 to 1979, were the first National League owners since the 1980s to be elected to the Hall; Kuhn — who died in March 2007 after receiving just 17% of the vote in the January 2007 vote — had been the only eligible commissioner who served more than five years who had not yet been elected. As with the other committee, voters apparently tried to vote for as many candidates as they were allowed, casting at least 44 of a possible 48 individual votes (vote totals for three candidates were not released). Five of the 10 candidates (Bavasi, Kuhn, Miller, O'Malley and Paul) were holdovers from the 2007 composite ballot, with McHale (who was then a member of the voting committee) being the only one who was not on the initial 2007 list of 60 candidates. The four candidates then living (Bavasi, Howsam, McHale and Miller) were all age 86 or older; Bavasi, Howsam and McHale all died within five months of the election. Miller's 51 votes on the 2007 ballot were second overall to Harvey and tops among executives, and made him the only executive to earn majority support that year.\nThe election committee, which was announced on the same day as the ballot, included:\nAfter the elections, various observers expressed skepticism over the failure to elect Marvin Miller, especially given the selection of Kuhn, his longtime bargaining adversary. It was noted that Miller had received 51 votes (out of 81) in the January 2007 election to Kuhn's 14, when all but one of the 84 eligible voters were former players, managers or members of the media; only two had been former executives, including one (McHale) who had previously played in the major leagues, and one former general manager (Lee MacPhail, father of 2008 committee member Andy). Miller had also outpolled Kuhn in the 2003 election by a 35-20 margin. In contrast, half of the 2008 committee was made up of six executives who had never been players, serving almost exclusively as team chairmen or CEOs (Andy MacPhail was the sole general manager), and this panel instead favored Kuhn by a 10-3 margin. Miller himself noted that he was unsurprised by the outcome, given the makeup of the revised committee, saying, \"This was done with precision. If you have a set goal in mind, and I think they did, it's not very hard. I'm so able to count votes in advance. Nothing has dimmed with age. No matter how various people involved in the Hall try to put a different gloss on it, it was done primarily to have somebody elected and secondarily to have particular people elected. I don't think this election was about me.\" He added, \"I think it was rigged, but not to keep me out. It was rigged to bring some of these [people] in. It's not a pretty picture. It's demeaning, the whole thing, and I don't mean just to me. It's demeaning to the Hall and demeaning to the people in it.\"\nAt the induction ceremonies, Andrew Dreyfuss gave the speech to accept the induction of his great-grandfather Barney, former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley accepted his father Walter's induction, and Paul Degener accepted the induction of his adoptive stepfather Bowie Kuhn.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nLarry Whiteside received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2007 meeting of the BBWAA but dated 2008 in a break from previous practice that gives a misleading appearance of skipping one year.)\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect.\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 10, 2007, in San Francisco in conjunction with All-Star Game activities: Nick Peters of \"The Sacramento Bee\", Dave Van Dyck of the \"Chicago Tribune\", and Larry Whiteside (1937–2007) of \"The Boston Globe\". All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 5 at baseball's winter meetings, Larry Whiteside was announced as the recipient, having received 203 votes out of the 411 ballots cast, with Peters receiving 119 votes and Van Dyck receiving 89. His son Tony gave the acceptance speech on his behalf.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nDave Niehaus received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster.\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect.\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two.\nTen finalists were announced on December 4, 2007. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a 20-member committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with 6 additional broadcasting historians and columnists: Bob Costas (NBC), Barry Horn (\"The Dallas Morning News\"), Stan Isaacs (formerly of New York \"Newsday\"), Ted Patterson (historian), Curt Smith (historian) and Larry Stewart (\"Los Angeles Times\"). The seven finalists chosen by the committee were: Tom Cheek, Ken Coleman, Dizzy Dean, Tony Kubek, Graham McNamee, Dave Niehaus and Dave Van Horne. Three additional candidates – Joe Nuxhall, Bill King and Joe Morgan – were selected from a list of 201 candidates through results of voting by fans conducted throughout November at the Hall's official website.\nOn February 19 it was announced that Dave Niehaus, play-by-play announcer for the Seattle Mariners since the team began play in 1977, would be the 2008 recipient. His signature \"My, oh my!\" and \"Get out the rye bread and mustard Grandma, cause it's grand salami time!\" had been the siren call of summer for Seattle fans for 31 years; at the time he was announced as the recipient, he had called 4,817 of their 4,899 games, and was also a 2000 inductee into the Mariners' Hall of Fame. He was selected in a January vote by the same committee which selected the finalists. They voted by mail, and based the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans.\nBuck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award.\nThe Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, which \"honors an individual whose extraordinary efforts to enhance baseball's positive impact on society has broadened the game's appeal, and whose character, integrity and dignity reflect the qualities embodied by Buck O'Neil throughout his life and career\", was established by the Hall in October 2007 in memory of O'Neil (1911–2006), a former Negro league player and manager, major league coach and scout, and longtime ambassador for the sport. O'Neil was named the first recipient of the honor, which will be bestowed by the Hall's board of directors at a minimum interval of three years. At the 2008 induction ceremonies, Hall of Famer Joe Morgan gave the speech to dedicate and accept the award; a statue of O'Neil, just inside the Hall's entrance, had been unveiled two days earlier."

The Final Four was held at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 27–29, 1998. Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, NC State, and Arkansas qualified for the Final Four. Tennessee and Louisiana Tech won their semi-final Final Four matchups and continued on to the championship. Tennessee defeated Louisiana Tech 93–75 to take their sixth title, and complete an undefeated season (39–0).\nFor the first time in the men's or women's tournament, two teams, Tennessee and Liberty, entered the tournament unbeaten (this feat was replicated in 2014 by the women's teams from Connecticut and Notre Dame). In the Mideast Regional, the Lady Vols blew out Liberty 102–58. However, in the West Regional, the expected 1–16 blowout did not happen. In that matchup, Harvard defeated an injury-plagued #1 seed Stanford on its home court 71–67. This was the first time in the men's or women's tournament that a #16 seed had beaten a #1 seed, a feat that would not be repeated until 2018 in the men's tournament. In addition, 9th-seeded Arkansas made the final four, the highest seed ever to do so in the women's tournament. The ninth-seeded Razorbacks remain the lowest seeded team to ever reach the Final Four in the women's tournament. Only 10th-seeded Oregon in 2017, 10th-seeded Creighton in 2022 and 11th-seeded Gonzaga in 2011 have even reached an Elite Eight to be in position to break this record. In addition, Arkansas remains the only 9 seed to even reach the Elite Eight in the women's tournament. This is the last time that two number 1 seeds failed to make the sweet 16 a feat not repeated until 2023 tournament. This is the last time an ivy league team upset a Pac -12 team in the top 4 seed a feat not repeated until 2023 in the men's tournament.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 1998 NCAA Tournament.

In nineteen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-four additional at-large teams were selected from eleven of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1998, the field remained at 64 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1–16 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 1 and 16 faced each other, as well as seeds 2 and 15, seeds 3 and 14, seeds 4 and 13, seeds 5 and 12, seeds 6 and 11, seeds 7 and 10, and seeds 8 and 9.

        "text": "Joseph Anthony Miller (October 6, 1898 – August 1, 1963) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and a Grey Cup champion Canadian football player. Miller was a goaltender for the New York Americans, New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Quakers between 1927 and 1931. Miller was a member of the 1928 New York Rangers Stanley Cup championship team.\nHockey.\nJoe Miller played for the New York Americans in 1928 when he was sent to the minors after being waived by the Americans. By an interesting set of circumstances his Stanley Cup opportunity arose. His season with Niagara Falls over, Miller was at home in Ottawa when New York Rangers goaltender Lorne Chabot was injured in the second game of the Stanley Cup Finals. Rangers coach and General manager Lester Patrick asked the Americans and the Maroons for permission to use Miller for the remainder of the series. The Americans agreed but Montreal Maroons head coach Eddie Gerard forced Lester Patrick to play goal for the rest of that game. Miller was the designated backup for all NHL teams at the time, and he was loaned to the Rangers. Miller played three games for the Rangers and won the 1928 Stanley Cup for the New York. \nLater he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Quakers. He wore uniform number 1.\nFootball.\nMiller was a skilled multi-sport athlete and was an accomplished elite football player. Suiting up for three seasons with the Ottawa Senators (an interim name for the Ottawa Rough Riders) he was a star player and part of two Grey Cup championship teams. In 1925 he was integral to his team's success, but missed the Grey Cup due to his hockey commitment in St.Paul. He was the star of the 14th Grey Cup in 1926, scoring three vital late games \"rouges\" (single points) and staving off two critical potential turnovers.\nStanley Cup and Grey Cup legacy.\nMiller's amazing two sport championship achievement makes him one of only three people to have their names engraved on both of Canada premier sport trophies, the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup, as players. The others are Lionel Conacher and Carl Voss.\nIn 1967 Joseph ‘Joe’ A. Miller was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame."

He also was a member of The Hawaiians in the World Football League (WFL). He played college football at Stanford University.\nEarly years.\nWilbur attended Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, California. He declined football scholarships from the University of Southern California and the University of California-Los Angeles, opting for Stanford University in 1961 and intending to study law with an Eagle Scout scholarship.\nHe became a starter at guard as a sophomore. He was a three-year starter and played offensive guard, offensive tackle and defensive end. As a junior, he had 13 tackles at defensive end in a 27–14 win against the University of Notre Dame. He graduated with a degree in history.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nWilbur was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the sixth round (45th overall) of the 1965 AFL Draft with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over. In 1966, he chose to sign with the NFL's Dallas Cowboys as a free agent in 1966. As a rookie, he quit training camp and had to be convinced to come back. He was tried at guard. defensive end and offensive tackle. He played mainly as the wedge-buster on special teams and as backup offensive tackle.\nHe was a part of the 1967 NFL Championship Game famously known as \"The Ice Bowl\". In 1968, he became the starter at right guard when Leon Donohue didn't recover from offseason surgery and was placed on the injured reserve list.\nBlocking for quarterback Don Meredith and playing with Peter Gent, Wilbur was an anti-hero, outspoken against the \"racists elements\" on the team and in the city. Part of the \"Wild Rebel Bunch\" contingency (along with Gent and Meredith), he infamously organized a group of Cowboys to be security guards at the Texas International Pop Festival. He was also a Player Representative in the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) for the Cowboys.\nOn June 5, 1970, he was initially traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for a third round draft choice (#69-Sam Scarber), but after threatening to retire, the Cardinals traded him to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for guard Mike Lahood. He was replaced by Blaine Nye, who was moved from defensive tackle to offensive guard.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nWilbur was a backup right guard for the Rams and played mostly on special teams under the auspices of hall of fame coach George Allen.\nHe was traded along with Jack Pardee, Maxie Baughan, Myron Pottios, Diron Talbert, Jeff Jordan and a 1971 fifth-round pick (124th overall–traded to Green Bay Packers for Boyd Dowler) from the Rams to the Washington Redskins for Marlin McKeever, first and third rounders in 1971 (10th and 63rd overall–Isiah Robertson and Dave Elmendorf respectively) and third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rounders in 1972 (73rd, 99th, 125th, 151st and 177th overall–to New England Patriots, traded to Philadelphia Eagles for Joe Carollo, Bob Christiansen, Texas Southern defensive tackle Eddie Herbert and to New York Giants respectively) on January 28, 1971.\nWashington Redskins.\nWilbur reunited with Allen and became a starter at right guard with the Washington Redskins from 1971 to 1973. He helped the team reach Super Bowl VII against the Miami Dolphins. He is credited with being one of the first players to sew the sleeves of his jerseys tight, later adopted by the League.\nIn 1972, Nixon was on his way up and the Vietnam War was raging. Wilbur was one of the Redskins players to support George McGovern and his anti-war platform. He became good friends with both McGovern and a young reporter, Hunter S. Thompson, who would later write Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. He also was named the treasurer for the NFLPA.\nThe Hawaiians (WFL).\nIn 1974, just before the NFLPA lockout concerning binding arbitration for salary disputes, Wilbur left the NFL to play for the Hawaiians of the World Football League. The next year, he was a player/coach on the offensive line.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn May 17, 1976, he signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles. He retired before the start of the season on September 6.\nPersonal life.\nWilbur earned a master's degree in business administration from the University of California, Los Angeles while playing for the Dallas Cowboys.\nThrough his time at Stanford, Wilbur developed a keen appreciation for rugby football. As his years in the NFL wound down Wilbur played with the Hawaii Harlequins Rugby Football Club, and continued to enjoy the social aspects of the game long after hanging up his boots. Wilbur was a regular at the Aspen Ruggerfest.\nWilbur died on December 9, 2013. Postmortem research showed Wilbur had chronic traumatic encephalopathy. He is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease, which is caused by repeated hits to the head.\nWilbur had three children: Nathan, Dione, and Lindsey, and four grandchildren."

        "text": "The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference, that represent the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Home games are played at the State Farm Center, located on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's campus in Champaign. Illinois has one pre-tournament national championship and one non-NCAA tournament national championship in 1915 and 1943, awarded by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Illinois has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 34 times, and has competed in 5 Final Fours, 10 Elite Eights, and has won 18 Big Ten regular season championships, and 4 Big Ten Tournament Championships.\nThe team is currently coached by Brad Underwood, who was hired on March 18, 2017. Through the end of the 2017–18 season, Illinois ranks 12th all-time in winning percentage and 15th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs.\nHistory.\n1906–12: Early years.\nThe Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team began play during the 1905–06 season with Elwood Brown guiding the team to a 9–8 record as their first coach. Frank L. Pinckney took control of the team before the start of the 1906–07 season. The team would win their first game but would end up dropping the next 10 contests. \nAnother coaching change led to Fletcher Lane being in charge of the team for the 1907–08 season. After starting the season 14–1 in non-conference, Illinois would finish the season losing five of their 11 conference games, ending the year third in the Western Conference with a 20–6 (6–5) record. \nEven though Lane led a successful season, his style of coaching was deemed subpar. Former Illini player Herb Juul was then hired as the head coach of the 1908–09 squad. The Illini would not see the same success as the season prior, finishing the season with a 7–6 (5–6) record. Despite the struggles, Juul became the first coach in Illinois history to return for more than one season. However, the 1909–10 season would be his last as the Illini finished with a 5–4 (5–4) record.\nThomas E. Thompson took the reigns before the 1910–11 season. The Illini would finish fourth in the Western Conference after earning a 6–6 (6–5) record. The 1911–12 season was Thompson's last year as head coach of the Illini after they finished with an 8–8 (4–8) record.\n1912–20: Ralph Jones era.\nBefore the start of the 1912–13 season, Illinois hired former Purdue head coach, Ralph Jones. During his three seasons in West Lafayette, Jones compiled a 32–9 record, while also winning the previous two Western Conference titles. During his first season with Illinois, Jones led the Illini to a 10–6 record which was Illinois' second 10-win season in school history.\nDuring the 1914–15 season, Illinois won their first-ever Big Ten title, going 16–0 (12–0). They were retroactively declared champion of that season by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. They would earn another Big Ten title during the 1916–17 season, sharing it with Minnesota.\n1936–47: Douglas Mills era.\nBefore the start of the 1936–37 season, Douglas R. Mills began acting as the head coach and athletic director of the Illinois men's basketball team. In his first season, the Illini finished with a 14–4 (10–2) record, which was good enough to share the Big Ten title with Minnesota.\nBefore World War II broke out, the Fighting Illini men's basketball program had achieved a status that had never been seen prior. Mills grouped a team of players, all around 6-foot-3, into a nearly undefeatable lineup later known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The 1941–42 freshman and sophomore lineup of Arthur Smiley, Ken Menke, Andy Phillip, Gene Vance, Victor Wukovits, and Art Mathisen dominated the Big Ten by posting a 13–2 conference record and winning the conference title outright. It would be their first unanimous Big Ten championship since 1915.\nThe Illini finished 1942–43 season with a 17–1 (12–0) record, winning their second-straight Big Ten title. Despite being ranked No. 1 in the nation, they opted not to play in the 1943 NCAA tournament after three of their five starters were called to duty in World War II. At the end of the season, they were named Premo-Porretto Pre-Associated Press Poll national champions.\nThe 1946–47 season, would be Mills' last season as the head coach of the Illini. The team ended the season with a 14–6 (8–4) record, finishing one game behind Wisconsin in the Big Ten standings. Under Mills, the Illini compiled a record of 151 wins and 66 losses while winning three conference championships in the process.\n1947–67: Harry Combes era.\nChampaign High School basketball coach Harry Combes was hired to succeed Doug Mills as Mills left the position to focus on his duties as the athletic director. Through his first five seasons as head coach, Combes led the Fighting Illini to three NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, and 1952. During his tenure as coach, Combes increased the Fighting Illini's offensive output by changing their style of play. Combes implemented Full-court press defense, causing turnovers at a high rate which translated into Fast break points.\nIn 1951, Combes signed the first black player to don an Illinois uniform, 3x All-State point guard Walt Moore of Mount Vernon. Along with teammate and future Illinois standout Max Hooper, Moore led the Rams to back-to-back state championship titles, culminating with a perfect 33–0 record in 1950.\nDuring the 1957–58 season, Mannie Jackson and Govoner Vaughn were inserted into the starting lineup as the first two African-Americans to start and letter in basketball at Illinois. Combes also oversaw the Illini's move from Huff Hall to Assembly Hall in 1963 and during that same season the Illini won a fourth Big Ten Conference championship under Combes. However, the Illini lost to eventual national champion Loyola (Chicago) in the Elite Eight of the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The following 1964–65 season, saw several upset victories over defending national champion UCLA Bruins and national powerhouse Kentucky Wildcats at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky.\nCombes' tenure came to an end as a result of the University of Illinois slush fund scandal. As head coach of the basketball team, he was primarily responsible for the basketball fund, and thus held a key role in the scandal. Assistant basketball coach Howie Braun also lost his job due to the scandal.\n1967–74: Harv Schmidt era.\nFormer Illini player Harv Schmidt was hired to fill the head coaching vacancy ten days after Combes' forced resignation. During his tenure, the Illini compiled an 89-77 overall record but went 43-55 in conference play. The team did not have any postseason appearances during his tenure.\n1974–75: Gene Bartow years.\nGene Bartow would later sign a five-year contract to replace Schmidt in 1974, but he left after one season in which the Illini finished last place in the conference to replace John Wooden at UCLA.\n1975–96: Lou Henson era.\nIn 1975, after having taken New Mexico State (and future Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins) to the 1970 Final Four, Lou Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace the legendary John Wooden at UCLA. Henson would lead the Fighting Illini back to their glory after having a number of difficult years following the Illinois slush fund scandal (where Illinois was hit with severe penalties for infractions that other Big 10 schools had in years prior been punished much more leniently (according to Sports Illustrated) at the time). In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris.\nEarly 1980s.\nIn 1981, Illinois made strides in its return to the national spotlight with a 21–8 record, a third-place Big Ten finish and an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The team received a first-round bye in the NCAA Tournament and beat Wyoming, 67–65, in Los Angeles to advance to the regionals in Salt Lake City, where Illinois lost to Kansas State, 57–52. During this season, the Fighting Illini led the Big Ten in scoring for the second consecutive season and were again led by Eddie Johnson and Mark Smith. Guards Craig Tucker and Derek Harper arrived to add backcourt punch, and Harper began his Illini career being named First-Team Freshman All-America by ESPN and ABC.\nFlyin' Illini.\nThe top-seeded and top-ranked 1989 Illini were upset 83–81 in the Final Four on a last second basket by Michigan's Sean Higgins, ending the school's deepest run in the tournament at that time. Illinois had beaten the Wolverines by 12 and 16 points in two previous meetings that season. The 1988–89 Illinois Fighting Illini team gained the moniker \"Flyin' Illini\" by Dick Vitale during an ESPN broadcast that season. The team also gained national prominence for its athletic players, such as NCAA slam dunk champions Kenny Battle and Kendall Gill, as well as Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, and Stephen Bardo.\n1990s.\nThe early 1990s Illini were dominated by players such as guards Andy Kauffman, Richard Keene, and Kiwane Garris, as well as centers Shelly Clark and Deon Thomas. Thomas was at the center of a report of misconduct by Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball assistant coach Bruce Pearl, who alleged that Thomas had been offered cash to attend Illinois. The Illini were suspended from postseason play for one season for unrelated violations uncovered during the investigation.\n1996–00: Lon Kruger years.\nAfter longtime coach Lou Henson's departure, Illinois hired Lon Kruger to fill the vacancy for the 1996 season. Kruger was the 14th head basketball coach in program history. During his four-year tenure he compiled a 59–38 record. He immediately made an impact at Illinois leading them to a 22–10 record and a second round NCAA tournament appearance in his first year. This created excitement because of the ninth-place finish the Illini had taken just before his arrival. Kruger inherited players such as Victor Chukwudebe, Jerry Hester, Kevin Turner, Jerry Gee, Matt Heldman, Brian Johnson, Kiwane Garris and Cleotis Brown. During his four seasons at Illinois, three of which resulted in NCAA Tournament berths, (all three of which saw the Illini eliminated in the 2nd round) Kruger became the only Big Ten coach to successfully sign three consecutive Illinois Mr. Basketball winners, inking Sergio McClain, Frank Williams, and Brian Cook between 1997 and 1999.Several times during his coaching tenure the Illini were predicted to be at the bottom of the Big Ten, however he overcame adversity each time performing far better than expected.\n2000–03: Bill Self years.\nIllinois picked Tulsa coach Bill Self from a list of numerous candidates, including popular assistant Jimmy Collins, to succeed Kruger, who moved on to the NBA to coach the Atlanta Hawks. Bill Self was hired to the Illini coaching staff as the 15th head coach in the history of the program. He spent his previous seven years as the head coach of Oral Roberts University and Tulsa University where he compiled an overall record of 129–71. In 2001, his first season at Illinois, Self coached his new Fighting Illini squad to a 27–8 record, a share of the Big Ten title, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. That 27-game winning season in Self's first year was the second most winning season in school history at that time. McClain, Cook and preseason Big Ten player of the year Cory Bradford led the Illini to the Elite Eight, where they fell to eventual finalist Arizona in a much disputed contest. The Illini were accused of being overly physical most of the season, especially McClain and pesky guards Sean Harrington and Lucas Johnson (younger brother of former Illini forward Brian Johnson). The '01 Illini team also included Robert Archibald, Damir Krupalija and Marcus Griffin. With mostly the same core, Illinois followed up the season with impressive 2002 and 2003 campaigns, but fell in the Sweet 16 in 2002. He was the first head coach in the Big Ten, since 1912, to lead his team to conference championships in each of his first two seasons. It was also the first time Illinois won back-to-back titles in 50 years. Self, also, had an overall record of 78–24 in his three years as Illinois head coach. Self left for Kansas after the 2003 season.\n2003–12: Bruce Weber era.\nBruce Weber served as the head coach of Illinois basketball for nine seasons from 2003 to 2012.\nAfter Bill Self left, Illinois AD Ron Guenther hired Weber to coach the Fighting Illini on April 30, 2003. Weber came from Southern Illinois University (SIU) in Carbondale and was touted as a loyal coach, which was valued by the Illinois AD after both Kruger and Self left Champaign with relatively short tenures. In his five seasons as head coach at SIU, Weber took the Saluki program to the top of the Missouri Valley Conference, winning league titles in 2002 and 2003. He posted records of 28–8 and 24–7 in his last two seasons, leading the Salukis to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Sweet 16 in 2002 with wins over Texas Tech and Georgia at the United Center in Chicago. His .689 (62–28) winning percentage in MVC play ranked 12th in the long history of the league. Weber earned Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors following the 2003 season.\nIllinois totaled 210 victories under Weber from 2004 to 2012. He ranks third on the Illinois career coaching wins list. He won 67.5 percent of his games while in charge of the Fighting Illini (210–101). Under Weber, the Illini had two Big Ten Championships (2004, 2005), two runner-up finishes (2006, 2009) and seven upper-division finishes.\nIllinois had five players selected in the NBA draft under Weber, as Deron Williams (No. 3, Utah Jazz) and Luther Head (No. 24, Houston Rockets) were taken in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft, and James Augustine (No. 41, Orlando Magic) and Dee Brown (No. 46, Utah Jazz) were chosen in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft. Meyers Leonard was chosen 11th by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft following Weber's final season. Utah's selection of Williams at No. 3 overall in the 2005 lottery made him the highest-drafted player in Illinois history.\nIt took just one season for Weber to etch his name in the Big Ten and Illinois record books after leading the Fighting Illini to its first outright Big Ten title in 52 years during the 2003–04 season. In leading his young team that featured just one senior on the roster, Weber became just the third coach in the history of the Big Ten to win an outright title in his first season. Illinois had to win 10 straight to end the regular season to claim the championship, including six-straight wins on the road. Illinois' 26 wins in 2003–04 tied the fourth-winningest season in school history. Weber also led the Illini to the Sweet 16 with NCAA Tournament victories over Murray State and Cincinnati.\nWeber's second year at Illinois, the 2004–05 season, will be remembered as one of the greatest in Fighting Illini history, finishing 37–2 as the National Runner-Up in the NCAA tournament. In a remarkable year where Illinois celebrated its centennial season of basketball, the Illini reeled off 29 straight wins to start the year, tying the 12th-best start in NCAA Div. I history and the third-best start in Big Ten history. Illinois also secured its second-straight outright Big Ten championship with a 15–1 league record, as Weber became the first coach in Big Ten history to win consecutive outright titles in his first two seasons. Illinois then added a Big Ten tournament championship in addition to its regular season title. The Illini were ranked No. 1 in the nation for 15 straight weeks, including a first-ever No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll.\nThey gained the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and prevailed in one of the most memorable games in NCAA history against Arizona. Down 15 points with around 4 minutes left, the Illini rallied with a run led by Luther Head and Deron Williams. The game was sent into overtime and the Illini pulled off a one-point win to advance to the 2005 Final Four in St. Louis. It was the Fighting Illini's first Final Four Appearance since the 1988–89 season. Against the Louisville Cardinals in the national semifinal game, the Illini posted their final victory of the season. All of the five Illini starters–Deron Williams, Luther Head, Dee Brown, James Augustine, and Roger Powell, Jr.–would eventually play in the NBA. Williams and Brown both joined the Utah Jazz roster, while Luther Head went on to play for the Sacramento Kings.\nWith all that Illinois accomplished during the season, Weber swept the 2005 National Coach of the Year awards, claiming the following: the Naismith Award, the most prestigious coaching award in college basketball; the Henry Iba Award, presented by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association; and, the Adolph F. Rupp Cup. Weber was also named National Coach of the Year by the NABC, Associated Press, The Sporting News, Basketball Times, CBS/Chevrolet, Victor Awards and Nike Championship Basketball Clinic.\nDespite losing three starters and 63 percent of its scoring from the 2004–05 NCAA runner-up squad, Weber directed the 2005–06 Illini to a third-consecutive 4829-win season, a runner-up finish in the Big Ten, the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and a ranking among the nation's top 17 teams throughout the entire season. The Illini spent the majority of 2005–06 ranked in the Top 10 and recorded 26 wins on the year to tie the fourth-winningest season in school history. The Illini were given a number 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they beat Air Force in the opening round, before falling to the University of Washington in the second round.\nThe 2006–07 team finished with a record of 23–12 (9–7) and finished tied for fourth in the Big Ten. With a depleted roster that had six different players combine to miss a total of 58 games due to injury, the Illini still advanced to the NCAA Tournament. They were awarded a 12 seed and lost in the opening round to Virginia Tech.\nThe 2007–08 season was one of the worst seasons in Illinois history, highlighted by a string of close losses. The lone bright spot came as Illinois came on strong to win four of its last five and five of its final seven games, which culminated with a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament. Weber's Illini became the first No. 10 seed in the tournament's history to advance to the title game, winning three games in three days with victories over Penn State, No. 17 Purdue, and Minnesota to reach the championship game vs. No. 8 Wisconsin. However, with an overall record of 16–19 (5–13), the Illini were not selected to participate in postseason play.\nWeber's 2008–09 UI squad was one of the most improved teams in the country finishing with a record of 24–10 (11–7). With 10 more regular season victories than it achieved the year before, Illinois posted the third-biggest turnaround in NCAA Division I and the second-biggest turnaround among BCS programs on the year. The Illini recorded 24 wins, ranking as the 10th winningest season in school history. Illinois was the Big Ten runner-up, earned a No. 5 seed in the 2009 NCAA Tournament, and finished the year ranked 24th in the Pomeroy rankings. The Illini lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the 12th-seeded Western Kentucky Hilltoppers.\nDuring the 2009–10 season, the Illini finished 21–15 (10–8) and finished 5th in the Big Ten. The team was widely considered to be \"on the bubble\" for the NCAA tournament and missed the tournament field by a narrow margin. The Illini competed in the NIT, falling at home to the Dayton Flyers in the NIT Quarterfinals.\nIllinois rebounded in 2010–11 to finish 20–14 (9–9) and tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Illini were selected to join the NCAA tournament as a #9 seed, where they defeated the #8 seeded UNLV Rebels setting up a matchup with the #1 seeded Kansas Jayhawks and former coach Bill Self. Kansas proved to be too much for the Illini, and the season came to an end in the round of 32.\nIn 2011–12, Weber's last as coach of the Illini, the team finished 17–15 (6–12), good for 9th in the conference. The team did not compete in the postseason. Illinois' new AD Mike Thomas fired Weber after the 2011–12 season.\n2012–17: John Groce era.\nJohn Groce was hired by the new athletic director Mike Thomas on March 28, 2012. During the 2012–13 season, the Illini were the Maui Invitational champions and later made the NCAA tournament, losing their second game to the Miami Hurricanes by a score of 63–59. The Illini spent eight weeks nationally ranked in the NCAA Division I rankings, and for two weeks were ranked as high as 10th in the country.\nThe 2013–14 season saw major roster turnover, with nine players leaving and nine players joining the program. This season was one to forget, as the Illini would ultimately miss the NCAA Tournament and lose in the second round of the NIT.\nIn 2014, Groce continued Illinois' success in November, improving to 21–0 under Groce and 32–0 overall during the past four seasons. Illinois is the only program in the nation with an undefeated November record dating back to 2011. The 2014–2015 season was once again disappointing for the Illini. Illinois finished with a record of 19–14, finishing tied for 7th place in the Big Ten with a record of 9–9. The Illini were then beaten in the first round of the NIT.\nThe 2015–16 season ended with the fewest total wins in almost 20 years since the 98–99 Lon Kruger crew won only 14 games. Groce's squad finished with a record of 15–19, taking 12th place in the Big Ten and receiving no post-season tournament invitations.\nThe 2016–17 season was another disappointing season for the Fighting Illini, as they finished the season at 18–14 and 8–10 in the conference, failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year. On March 11, 2017, the university announced via press release that Groce had been relieved of his duties as head men's basketball coach. The next day, the team was put into the NIT as a 2-seed. The team was coached during the NIT by interim coach Jamall Walker, making it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by the University of Central Florida.\n2017–24: Brad Underwood era.\nOn March 18, 2017, Brad Underwood was hired by athletic director Josh Whitman. Underwood previously coached at Stephen F. Austin from 2013 to 2016, before spending one year at Oklahoma State. In Underwood's first season at Illinois, the team won each of their first five contests. After beginning conference play 0–8, they ended the season with a record of 14–18.\nWhile the 2018–19 season featured the debut of key pieces including Ayo Dosunmu, Giorgi Bezhanishvili, Andres Feliz, and Alan Griffin, the Illini posted one of the worst records in program history at 12–21 (7–13 in Big Ten). Despite the poor record, Illinois had many memorable moments such as upsetting #9 Michigan State at home and Bezhanishvili scoring 35 points against Rutgers, breaking the Illini record for most points by a freshman in a single game.\nThe 2019–20 season was the freshman year of highly ranked center Kofi Cockburn. The Illini started the season slow in the first game, barely beating Nicholls State 78–70 in overtime. During the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, Illinois played Miami where they lost 81–79 after they mounted a huge comeback before a charge was called against Dosunmu on the game's final play. The next game they traveled to College Park to play against #3 Maryland. The Illini led by 14 at the half, but Maryland outscored Illinois 34–19 in the second half and won the game by an Anthony Cowan free throw. The Illini next played #5 Michigan at the State Farm Center. They would beat the Wolverines 71–62 to improve to 7–3 on the season. Over the next 12 games, the Illini went 10–2, including Dosunmu's game-winning shot during their second matchup against Michigan to give Illinois a 64–62 lead with half a second left on the clock. Illinois would finish the season with a 21–10 (13–7) record which would be good enough for 4th in the Big Ten. They would also finish ranked 21st in the AP Poll and 22nd in the Coaches Poll.\nThe 2020–21 season that Underwood finally had mostly his recruits running the team and it certainly showed on the court. After much deliberation, Ayo Dosunmu returned to Illinois for his junior season instead of going to the NBA. He, along with Kofi Cockburn, helped make Illinois into a top-10 team. They went 16-4 (0.800) in the B1G conference but had a worse record than Michigan (14-3, 0.824), and therefore did not earn even a share of the title. This title was disputed as Michigan had failed to play three extra games because of COVID protocols, and only one loss in those three games would have given Illinois the title; Illinois had beaten Michigan by 23 without leading scorer Ayo Dosunmu in Ann Arbor. The team went on to win the Big Ten tournament title, however, after a hard-fought, overtime 91–88 win over OSU. Illinois became a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 4th time in school history. They were upset by Loyola-Chicago in the 2nd round and finished the season 24–7. Dosunmu became the first player in Illini history to earn 1st-team All-America honors by the AP. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 2nd-team.\nBefore the 2021–22 season, Ayo Dosunmu was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, and Adam Miller transferred to LSU, leading to André Curbelo being expected to serve as the primary ball handler. Unfortunately, Curbelo suffered a concussion prior to the season opener that would continue to affect him throughout the season. The team was led by fifth-year players Trent Frazier and Da'Monte Williams. Kofi Cockburn returned for his junior year but was suspended for the first three games for selling his team jerseys during the off-season. The team tied with Wisconsin for a share of the Big Ten regular season title, with a record of 15-5. Due to the tiebreaker rules, the team was seeded first in the Big Ten Tournament but lost its first game to ninth-seeded Indiana. The team was given the #4 seed in the South region of the NCAA tournament. After a 54-53 victory against Chattanooga, the team lost in the second round to Houston. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 1st-team.\nThe roster suffered from some major turnover before the 2022–23 season, with five players transferring out of the program, four players graduating, and Kofi Cockburn electing to stay in the NBA draft (and ultimately going undrafted). Three players transferred into the program and six freshmen were recruited. As a result of the roster changes, the team would be led by Terrence Shannon Jr. and Coleman Hawkins. The Illini would secure two major wins in non-conference play, beating #8 UCLA in the Continental Tire Main Event semifinal and #2 Texas in the Jimmy V Classic. Both Zacharie Perrin and Skyy Clark left the program during the season. Ultimately the season was a step back for the program, as due to tiebreaker rules, the team received a seven seed and lost to Penn State in their first game of the Big Ten Tournament. The team then received the #9 seed in the West region and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Arkansas. For the first time since Underwood's second season, the team finished the season unranked in the AP Poll.\nThe 2023-24 season would be one to remember. Three pivotal graduate transfers, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, and Justin Harmon joined the team, with Domask and Guerrier starting most games. The Illini went on an undefeated trip to Spain and then beat #1 ranked Kansas in a televised exhibition game. The team lost only two games to non-NCAA tournament teams, once to Penn State and once to Maryland. After finishing second in the Big Ten standings, the team ultimately won the Big Ten Tournament, prevailing over Wisconsin. The team was selected to the NCAA tournament as the #3 seed in the East region. For the first time in Underwood's tenure, the team made the Sweet Sixteen, where it beat the #2 seed, Iowa State. For the first time since the 2004–05 season, the team made the Elite Eight, where it lost to #1-overall UConn.\nChampionships.\nConference championships.\nRegular season.\n† – Conference co-champions\nPostseason history.\nNCAA Division I Tournament.\nSeeding.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Fighting Illini have appeared in the NCAA tournament 33 times.

Before the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It also was home to the Women's Volleyball program from 1974 until 1989, after which the program moved to Huff Hall in 1990.\nHuff Hall (1925–1963).\nHuff Hall is a 4,050-seat multi-purpose arena in Champaign, Illinois, United States. The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after George Huff, the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935. Huff Hall is home to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini volleyball and wrestling teams. Before the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well.\nState Farm Center (1963–).\nAssembly Hall opened on March 2, 1963, and hosts the home games for the men's and women's basketball teams. Max Abramovitz, an Illinois alumnus, was the lead architect behind the building of the indoor arena. At the time of its opening, Assembly Hall could hold 16,128 people, making it the largest dome structure in North America until the Houston Astrodome opened in 1965. \nIn 2008, school officials, led by athletic director Ron Guenther, conducted a study to decide whether to refurbish the Assembly Hall or build a new basketball arena. In 2010, they decided to keep the arena. In 2014, renovations began under the watch of AECOM, an architectural firm based out of Dallas Texas. The estimated cost of the project was estimated to be around $169.5 million and in turn State Farm Insurance decided to buy the naming rights of the stadium.\nUbben Basketball Complex (1998–present).\nThe 2-story, 40,000-square-foot building is home to the University of Illinois Men's and Women's basketball programs. The facility includes offices, locker areas, weight training facilities and team meeting rooms in addition to the practice basketball courts. The Illinois Champions Campaign was a major catalyst of the $40 million renovation.\nRivalries.\nIndiana Hoosiers.\nIllinois and Indiana's rivalry started because the teams share a state border and they are located about 153 miles (246 km) apart. They have played annually since 1906. Indiana currently leads the series 96–92. The teams have played each other in five top-ten matchups, the first coming in 1952 when 2nd-ranked Illinois beat 4th-ranked Indiana 78–66. The longest winning streak was when Indiana won nine consecutive matchups from 1972 to 1977.\nNotable Illini players and coaches.\nHonored jerseys.\nTo have an honored jersey hung in the State Farm Center, a player must have achieved one of the following criteria:\n1) National Player of the Year\n2) Enshrined in the National Basketball Hall of Fame\n3) Big Ten Player of the Year\n4) Consensus First- or Second-Team All-American\n5) Illinois All-Century Team Member\n6) Individual whose pioneering efforts made a significant impact on Illinois and international basketball\nNCAA All-Americans.\nIllinois has had a total of 34 players who have claimed All-American status.\n† = Consensus All-American\nIllinois All-Century Team.\n Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. &lt;br&gt;\n National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. &lt;br&gt;\n Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame inductee. &lt;br&gt;\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer milestones.\nSource for all statistical leaders\nIndividual honors.\nConsensus All-American.\n8 Illini were recognized as consensus first team All-Americans.\nJordan Brand Classic.\nThe following 4 Jordan Brand Classic participants have played for Illinois:\nNike Hoop Summit.\nThe following 4 Fighting Illini have played in the Nike Hoop Summit:\nMcDonald's All-Americans.\nThe following 13 McDonald's All-Americans have played for Illinois:\nMr. Basketball.\nThe following 16 Mr. Basketball award winners have played for Illinois:\nIllinois honored players.\nAll-Century Team.\nIn 2004, during the celebration of the program's 100th year of basketball as a varsity sport, the University of Illinois Division of Intercollegiate Athletics announced its All-Century Team.

It is a single-elimination tournament of four rounds, with the top six seeds getting byes in the first round. Seeding is based on regular season records.\nThe winner of the tournament receives the Big 12 Conference automatic bid to the NCAA Championship tournament.\nBetween 2005 and 2019, no current Big 12 member besides Iowa State or Kansas won the tournament, and those two schools have won 18 of 27 titles. The remaining current Big 12 schools only account for six additional tournament titles. For its first twenty-three years, no school from outside the original Big Eight Conference had ever won the tournament. This streak ended when the Texas Longhorns won the championship game against Oklahoma State in 2021.\nThe tournament is set to be held at the T-Mobile Center (formerly Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri until 2031.\nHistory.\nThe tournament has been held every year since the first full basketball season was completed in 1997. (The Big 12 was formed in 1996) Since that time, it was held in Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri in early March for every year up until 2003, and also in 2005. In 2003, 2004, and 2006 it was held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, and in 2007 it was held in the Ford Center at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 2008 it was again held in Kansas City, but this time at the Sprint Center.\nThe 2009 edition of the championship was held in Oklahoma City, with the event returning to Kansas City from 2010 through 2020.

        "text": "John Duffield Curtis (born March 9, 1948) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Twice a first-round draft pick, Curtis played baseball at Clemson University and then pitched for several Major League Baseball (MLB) teams between 1970 and 1984. He retired with an 89–97 win–loss record and a 3.96 earned run average (ERA).\nEarly life.\nCurtis attended Smithtown High School in Smithtown, New York. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign, choosing instead to attend Clemson University. In 1967, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nCareer.\nBoston Red Sox.\nAfter two seasons at Clemson, he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft, and signed with the club.\nCurtis was called to the majors during his third minor league season, and made his major league debut as a reliever on August 13, against the Kansas City Royals. After getting through his first two innings with just one hit and one walk, he loaded the bases, and gave up a grand slam to Ed Kirkpatrick in his third inning of work. He did not pitch in the majors again for over a year.\nWhen he returned to the BoSox in September , he was used as a starter by manager Eddie Kasko. After losing his first two starts against the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers, he got his first major league win out of the bullpen against the Cleveland Indians. He then pitched a complete game victory over the Washington Senators in his final game of the season.\nCurtis began the season with the triple A Louisville Colonels, but he was back with the Red Sox by the end of May. He was traded after the season with Mike Garman and Lynn McGlothen to the St. Louis Cardinals for Reggie Cleveland, Terry Hughes and Diego Seguí.\nWith the new designated hitter rule to go into effect the following season, Curtis became the last pitcher to ever bat at Fenway Park on September 28, 1972, in the bottom of the seventh inning in a 3-1 Red Sox win against the Kansas City Royals.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cards were battling the Pittsburgh Pirates for first place in the National League East all season when the Bucs came to Busch Stadium for a three-game set September 23–25, . The Pirates took two of the three with Curtis taking the loss in the second game. Curtis spent three seasons in St. Louis, going 24–34 with a 3.88 earned run average and 208 strikeouts, mostly as a starter.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nAfter the season, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants with Willie Crawford and Vic Harris for Mike Caldwell, John D'Acquisto and Dave Rader. Curtis became predominantly a reliever for the first time in his career while with the Giants. He went 17–15 with a 4.45 ERA over three seasons with the Giants, appearing in 116 games.\nCurtis played for the San Francisco Giants from 1977 to 1979. In his first start for the Giants on May 8, 1977, Curtis pitched a two-hit 10–0 shutout versus the Mets and hit for two singles and a triple. While playing for the Giants, Curtis lived in Foster City, California.\nSan Diego Padres.\nHe was converted back to a starter when he signed with the San Diego Padres as a free agent for the season, and emerged as the ace of the staff by the end of the season, going 10–8 with a 3.51 ERA for the last-place team. He began the strike-shortened season as a starter, but after going 0–2 with a 6.30 ERA in that role, he was converted to a reliever, and pitched exclusively in that role during the second half of the season when play resumed.\nCalifornia Angels.\nCurtis' contract was purchased by the California Angels on August 31, , during their playoff drive. Though he joined his new club in time to be on the postseason roster, he did not see any playing time during the 1982 American League Championship Series. He remained with the Angels through , then retired.\nPersonal life.\nCurtis lives in Long Beach, California, with his wife, Mary Ann. Upon retiring, Curtis began freelance writing articles for the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\", \"Boston Globe\", \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and \"Sports Illustrated\". After a nearly twenty-year absence from the game, he returned to coach the Long Beach Breakers during the two-year run of the independent Western Baseball League ( and ).\nCurtis was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Baseball Category with the Class of 1992."

        "title": "Baseball in the Netherlands",
        "text": "Baseball in the Netherlands started in , having been introduced to the country by English teacher J.C.G Grasé of Amsterdam, following a holiday to America. The first professional baseball league (now the Honkbal Hoofdklasse) began in . The national governing body for baseball is the Royal Netherlands Baseball and Softball Federation ().\nThe Netherlands National Baseball Team is consistently ranked in the top ten of the WBSC World Rankings and has won the European Baseball Championship twenty-four times. Although baseball is a minority sport within the Netherlands proper, it is the main sport of the Dutch overseas territories in the Caribbean (the former Netherlands Antilles).\nHistory.\n1911 - 1940.\nThe driving force in the early days of Dutch baseball was J.C.G. Grasé of Amsterdam. After discovering baseball while on vacation in the United States, he introduced the game in the Netherlands in 1911. An English teacher by profession, Grasé was able to translate the rules of the game into Dutch. The first official games were played in 1911 and on March 12, 1912, Grasé founded the Dutch Baseball Union. Grasé was also the founder of the oldest baseball club in Europe, Quick Amsterdam (founded 1 March 1913).\nThe first official competition was played in 1922. The major league was formed out of four clubs that year: Ajax (a branch of the famous football club), Blue White (also a football club), Hercules and Quick Amsterdam. Quick Amsterdam became the first Dutch champion.\nDuring the early years, baseball was only played in Amsterdam, but quickly spread to Haarlem as well. These two cities dominated Dutch baseball until 1963.\nIn 1925, a ship of the US Navy visited Amsterdam. Players of Blue White heard of the visit and invited the sailors to a game of baseball. After one inning, the Americans led 14-0. After two hours of play, the final score was 27-2.\nIn the early days, the pitcher was the one who could throw the fastest ball. At the time, it was considered unsportsmanlike to bunt or to take advantage of the lack of control by a pitcher and it was considered a humiliation to get a base on balls. It was far better to hit a fly out than to reach first base on four balls. Furthermore, the sport was played wearing shorts.\nAt the end of the 1937 season, EDO from Haarlem and Blue White from Amsterdam played each other to determine the Dutch champion. The game was played with a two-hour time limit. The coach of EDO thought that he had won the game after the final out of an inning, but according to the umpire, there were three more minutes to be played, so a new inning began. The players of EDO were furious and Blue White ended up winning and became Dutch champion. This was the final instance of a two-hour time limit, and beginning in 1938, games in the major league lasted nine innings.\nIn 1939, a team of Mormon missionaries from Salt Lake City played in the Dutch league under the name Seagulls. They only lost two games (vs. Blue White from Amsterdam 7-1, and vs. HHC from Haarlem 6-2).\n1940 - 1970.\nAfter the German invasion in May 1940, baseball went through a difficult period. As the war continued, baseball materials became scarce. Starting in 1943, baseballs were made of rubber-like substance with a cork center. The balls, which were made by the tire company Vredenstein, could absorb little more than a couple of hits, before breaking apart. Some pitchers would cut out a small piece in order to throw a curveball, because the balls didn't have seams. Clubs were forced to mend cracked bats with screws or whatever other materials were handy.\nAfter World War II, the Americans helped Europe rebuild with the Marshall Plan. They also sent baseball materials to the Netherlands including uniforms, bats, balls, etc. Teams like OVVO from Amsterdam and HHC from Haarlem played in red uniforms.\nMany games were played against military teams. In their own league, the Dutch could hold their own, but not against the better skilled Americans. Han Urbanus, was the best Dutch pitcher in these days. Getting a hit against him guaranteed a starting spot in the Dutch national team. A Dutch American journalist, Albert Balink, managed two trips to spring training camp for Han Urbanus. The journalist knew that the Dutchman would need a lot more experience to improve. Martin Jole, one of the players who could hit Hans Urbanus, went to a spring training camp with the Cincinnati Reds. He showed Dutch players how swinging a bat day after day could improve their hitting.\nAlbert Balink also introduced medals for the best players and hitters, which allowed him to show that baseball is a sport of stats. In 1953, Han Urbanus got a phone call from the USA. The New York Giants had offered him a minor league contract. He refused, due to the fact that he preferred to teach his fellow countrymen what he had learned in the USA.\nFrom 1949 to 1953, Dutch baseball was dominated by OVVO from Amsterdam, which claimed five consecutive national titles. In 1955, the club won it for the last time, and would never win another championship again.\nThe post-war help of the Americans helped the Dutch earn their first European title in 1956 in Rome, Italy. Han Urbanus was a defensive force and the Dutch batters performed very well. Because of the European title, the Dutch were allowed to go to the Global World Series. American coaches like Ron Fraser and Bill Arce helped the Dutch to improve their game. The number of baseball fields built around the country increased dramatically.\nIn 1963, a real baseball stadium was built in Haarlem. This stadium would be the base of the Haarlem Baseball Week, a yearly event.\nPrior to 1963, baseball was dominated by teams from Amsterdam and Haarlem. But in 1963, Sparta from Rotterdam became the Dutch champion. From 1963 to 1974, Sparta clinched nine national titles, a record not exceeded until 1985 by the Haarlem Nicols. In the early sixties, each team played 14 games; one game every weekend.\n1970 – present.\nIn 1970, a Dutch-born pitcher named Bert Blyleven made the Minnesota Twins roster. He had a very successful Major League career which lasted until 1992, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010. He was, however, raised in California and never played in the Dutch league. The first Dutch Major League Baseball player who actually grew up and learned the game in the Netherlands was Win Remmerswaal, who pitched briefly for the Boston Red Sox in 1979 and 1980.\nDutch baseball was dominated by Sparta from Rotterdam in the early 70s. The \"magnificent three\" from the Dutch Antilles were unstoppable: Hudson John, Simon Arrindell and Hamilton Richardson, who all had a big influence on Sparta, but by 1974, the era was over.\nAt the end of the 1972 season, the football club Ajax decided to cut loose the baseball branch, ending the ball club.\nAt the end of the 1977 season, there was some turmoil at OVVO from Amsterdam. This baseball club was also a branch of a football club. The football club, an amateur side, decided to turn professional and begin paying players. The baseball branch did not agree, and big names, like Han Urbanus, decided to leave and founded a new club: Amstel Tigers. Other players like Charles Urbanus Jr. (pitcher/shortstop), Jan Hijzelendoorn (pitcher), Paul Smit (catcher) and Don Wedman decided to follow suit, along with almost the entire team. The Dutch Baseball Federation tried to mediate, but the players did not come back. The city of Amsterdam appointed a terrain in the Western part of the city. The Amstel Tigers thought that field would be too far away, but ultimately the new club built a baseball field there, which is now used by Quick Amsterdam.\nIn the meantime, OVVO would not be persuaded to take a step back to a lower division. The Amstel Tigers started their first season in the \"overgangsklasse\"; a league one level lower than the hoofdklasse. With such strong players, the Tigers were quickly promoted to the top division in 1979. OVVO's 1978 season was a disaster and the team was relegated. The Amstel Tigers went on to become champions in 1979, 1980, and 1986.\nIn 1979, a Dutch pitcher made his MLB debut on the mound in Milwaukee. The Red Sox were trailing 4-1, as they called pitcher Win Remmerswaal. His debut was a good one, even though his team lost 5-3. After the game, journalists seemed fascinated that a Dutch player could have come so far in the game. The MLB career of Win Remmerswaal only lasted two seasons, due to injuries. After the 1980 season, Remmerswaal had pitched in 22 games (3 victories and 1 loss). His short career among baseball's elite lasted 55 innings. After his Major League career, Remmerswaal went to Italy, and played on several teams for many years.\nThe eighties and nineties were bad decades for many baseball clubs. In 1986, Charles Urbanus, Jr. decided that it would be his last season. This was a huge blow for his club, the Amstel Tigers. Urbanus was a magnet for players, who considered it an honour to play with him. But an Amstel Tigers without him was not as attractive to new talent and the club lost competitiveness. Eventually, the members voted for a merger with HCAW from Bussum, a club that was playing the lower league. The new club, HCAW Tigers, were promoted to the major league in 1989 and would go on to win the title in 1996 and 1998, albeit without any of the old Amstel Tigers players. Haarlem Nicols were particularly dominant in the 1980s with seven pennants over ten years, but declared bankruptcy in 1994, just five years after winning their last pennant.\nIn 1981, Neptunus Rotterdam won the pennant for the first time since the baseball team's foundation in 1942. Neptunus began to dominate the championship during the 1990s and 2000s, winning eleven pennants in total including seven consecutively between 1999 and 2005.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2006.\nIn 2006, the Netherlands finished 3rd in Pool C behind Puerto Rico and Cuba.\n2009.\nIn 2009, the Netherlands defeated the heavily favored Dominican Republic twice to qualify for the second round of the World Baseball Classic. The Dutch upset the Dominican team 3-2 in their first meeting and 2-1 in 11 innings in a qualification game.\n2013.\nIn 2013, the Netherlands finished 2nd in Pool B with wins over South Korea and Australia. In the second round the Netherlands were placed in Pool 1. The Dutch beat Cuba twice while losing to Japan twice to finish as the second seed. In the semifinals they fell to the Dominican Republic 4-1.\n2017.\nThe Netherlands again lost in the semifinals, this time to Puerto Rico. They reached there by going 2-1 both in the first and second rounds.\nBaseball World Cup (IBAF).\n2009.\nIn 2009, for the first time in history, the Baseball World Cup was hosted by a continent rather than a single country. The Netherlands were one of 8 European countries to host the tournament. Together with Italy, they hosted the second round, which is the reason they received a bye through the first round. In the second round they faced the teams from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, South Korea, Nicaragua, Spain and Great Britain. They went undefeated through the first six games, but lost the final game to Cuba, 3-5.\nThey went into the third round as the top seed, where they faced the teams from the United States, Canada, Australia and Chinese Taipei. In the first game, they defeated Chinese Taipei 11-2 but they lost their 3 remaining games.\nBefore the final round, every team was ranked based on their results of the second and third round. As a result, the Netherlands played Australia in their final game of the tournament where the fifth and sixth position was determined. They lost this game 1-4 and finished the tournament in sixth place with a record of 7 wins and 5 losses. Catcher Sidney de Jong was selected for the tournaments All Star Team.\n2011.\nIn 2011, in the 39th and final World Baseball cup, the Netherlands defeated the \"baseball powerhouse\" Cuba, and became world champion for the first time in history. \nIn the first round, they played the teams from Canada, Panama, the United states, Puerto Rico, Japan, Chinese Taipei and Greece. They only lost to Canada, 4-5 in extra innings, but they were able to win all of the other 6 games, including a 19-0 shutout over Greece. Tied for the first seed, they played South Korea, Australia, Cuba and Venezuela in the second round. They won all 4 games, including an outstanding performance against Venezuela, who they defeated 12-2 in 7 innings.\nIn the championship game, they played 25-time champion Cuba. Their manager, Brian Farley, led them to a 2-1 victory. Curt Smith scored for the Dutch team and received MVP honors, while Tom Stuifbergen was declared best pitcher of the tournament."

The tournament concluded with eight teams competing in the College World Series, a double-elimination tournament in its eighth year. Eight regional districts sent representatives to the College World Series, but for the first time the preliminary tournament rounds hosted by each district were sanctioned NCAA events. These events would later become known as regionals.

After the incident with a plane flying a banner urging Cuban athletes to defect in the opening ceremony, Cuban immigrants to the United States continued to use the games as a way to confront the Castro regime, using the Cuban athletes as a proxy. This games marked the first time since the Cuban Revolution that Cuban athletes had participated in the United States. During boxing events at the Indiana Convention Center, anti-Castro Cuban-American protestors mocked the Cuban boxers from the stands. The police were unable to stop the Cuban boxers from entering the stands and punching the protestors in retaliation. According to witnesses, up to a dozen Cuban boxers, including Pablo Romero, as well as a hundred spectators were involved. Two people were hospitalized. After these incidents Manuel Gonzalez Guerra, who was Cuba's top sports official, publicly demanded that organizers keep the anti-Castro protestors away from the Cuban athletes. In private, he also unsuccessfully asked the Indianapolis police chief to lock the activists up. Mark Miles, the president of the organizing committee, made a phone call to the Ronald Reagan administration in the White House, who subsequently pressed Cuban-American activists groups to dial down the pressure by the final week."

        "text": "Cross-country skiing was one of the three disciplines of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007, held between February 22 and March 4, 2007 in Sapporo, Japan. The sprint events were held at the Sapporo Dome and the distance races were held at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium.\nThe distances and skiing styles were unchanged from Oberstdorf, and as in 2005, nine different nations won medals. However, France and Canada were without medals this time around, replaced by Belarus, who won their first medal ever through 19-year-old Leanid Karneyenka, and Slovenia, for whom Petra Majdič won silver on the very first day of the Championships. \nNorway took the most medals: twelve medals of a possible 36, with five of twelve golds, despite falling in the men's team sprint where the Norwegians were defending champions. However, compared to 2005 Norway had one less gold medal and two fewer medals, largely due to the less than stellar performance of Marit Bjørgen, who won five medals in Oberstdorf, but earned her best individual finish of ninth in the 30 km event in Sapporo. However, Norwegian skiers won both the sprint and 15 km for men, events they had not taken in 2005, as well as dominating the 50 km with gold and silver. \nFinland took three golds and a bronze, all by Virpi Kuitunen, who won the most medals at the games, while Germany won six medals but only one gold with Tobias Angerer in the 15 km + 15 km double pursuit where German skiers finished first, second and fourth. Russia won four medals, earned by the men's team (sprint and relay: both silvers) and Olga Zavyalova, but also had to suffer with a doping controversy with newcomer Sergey Shiryayev being disqualified for EPO doping and serving a two-year ban as a result. \nThe Czech Republic won three medals, with Kateřina Neumannová winning a gold and a silver medal at her final World Championships to retire with five medals, as did Italy, where 35-year-old Cristian Zorzi won his first gold medal at the World Championships with a team sprint win along with Renato Pasini. Finally, Sweden won two medals, with substitute Mats Larsson winning silver in the individual sprint, and the relay team winning bronze.\nMen's events.\nIndividual sprint classical.\nFebruary 22, 2007 at the Sapporo Dome. The defending champion was Vasily Rochev of Russia. Svartedal's third international win of the season was the most important one, improving significantly from his previous career-best 11th place. Rochev was eliminated in the semi-finals after losing contact with Swedes Björn Lind and Emil Jönsson over the final climb; Lind, the Olympic sprint champion, reached the final but lost the sprint for bronze to Rønning. Larsson, who was a reserve for former the world champion Thobias Fredriksson, was the best Swede to finish after passing Rønning at the final curve.\nTeam sprint freestyle.\nFebruary 23, 2007 at the Sapporo Dome. The defending winners were Norway's Tore Ruud Hofstad and Tor Arne Hetland. Zorzi edged Rochev at the line to earn the gold. The Czech Republic team of Šperl and Kožíšek earned the bronze after the favored Norwegian team fell at the end of the third leg, causing the team to finish seventh in the final.\n15 km freestyle interval start.\nFebruary 28, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. Pietro Piller Cottrer of Italy was the defending champion. Biathlete Lars Berger, with three World Championship medals in men's biathlon (including a silver medal at the most recent championships in the 4 x 7.5 km relay at Rasen-Antholz), started early and went through half the race before snow started to fill the tracks. This would prove advantegous when the third of the 121 starters, Leanid Karneyenka, with no World Cup starts and a previous best of 16th from the World Junior Championships, won silver, Belarus' first medal at the World Championships. Angerer, the World Cup leader, earned his second medal at the championships with a bronze. Berger is the first person to win medals in both the biathlon and nordic skiing world championships in the same year. Austria's Johannes Eder originally finished fourth in this event, but was disqualified on November 22, 2007 after the FIS issued a two-year doping suspension in the wake of Eder's action during the Winter Olympics in Turin the previous year. Eder had appealed the initial ban in 2006 only to have the FIS reinstate the ban the following year.\nThe results below are correct as of November 29, 2007.\n15 km + 15 km double pursuit.\nFebruary 24, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. France's Vincent Vittoz was the defending champion, but the Frenchman lost contact at the end of the classical section, never recovered, and finished tenth. The top three positions at the end of the classical part were Germany's Jens Filbrich (who finished fourth), Sweden's Mathias Fredriksson (who finished 14th), and Angerer. A peloton of 15–20 skiers entered the last lap in the lead, but Angerer blew the field apart in the final climb, reducing the field to six in the last 500 metres. Norway's Petter Northug, at his first individual World Championship appearance, advanced through the six-man group in the final 500 m stretch, but stuck a pole between his skis and took a tumble with approximately 300 metres to the finish, eventually finishing fifth. Teichmann beat Angerer in a dash to the finish, while Piller Cottrer settled for bronze. Teichmann and Angerer are the first Germans to win gold and silver at the same distance in the cross-country portion of the World Championships.\n50 km classical mass start.\nMarch 4, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. Frode Estil of Norway was the defending champion and lost it in the final meters of the event to fellow Norwegian Hjelmeset in a race where the lead changed hands continuously, as more and more people fell off the leading group. At 5 km, the top three were Eldar Rønning (Norway), Jean Marc Gaillard (France), and Dan Roycroft (Canada), in a peloton still consisting of nearly 60 skiers. Rønning and Roycroft would fall off within 25 km, while Gaillard stayed with the peloton for nearly 40 km. By the 20 km mark, the leaders were Sweden's Anders Södergren (who would finish 14th), Hjelmeset, and Estil, with a field of 20 remaining within ten seconds of the leader. At the 35 km mark, a group of nine had taken the lead, with Estil, Lukáš Bauer of the Czech Republic (who would finish fifth after leading for most of the second of half of the race), and Gaillard in the top three positions. Midway through the race, Hjelmeset suffered a broken binding and had to have one of his skis replaced. Four skiers fell off before the last 3.75 km loop, leaving two Norwegians, two Germans (Jens Filbrich and Tobias Angerer), and Bauer to fight for the medals. The two Norwegians attacked at the 48 km mark, and then held on for first and second. It was Hjelmeset's third championships gold medal, the first in an individual event. Germany's Filbrich would earn the bronze, his first individual medal in his championship history.\n4 × 10 km relay.\nMarch 2, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. The defending champions of this event were the Norwegian foursome of Odd-Bjørn Hjelmeset, Frode Estil, Lars Berger, and Tore Ruud Hofstad which they successfully defended following a race in which the lead changed hands at the line on all four legs of the event. The top three after the first leg were Finland (who finished sixth), France (who finished fifth), and Norway with Finland's Ville Nousiainen having the fastest leg of 25:39.4. Leaders after the second leg were a tie for first with Norway and Sweden, followed by Russia with Sweden's Mathias Fredriksson having the fastest time of 24:45.5 (also the fastest time in the classical legs of the event). Russia, Norway, Sweden were the top three leaders after the third leg with Russian Alexander Legkov having the fastest time of 20:03.0 (also the fastest time in the freestyle legs of the event). Petter Northug of Norway had the fastest time in the anchor leg (20:15.1) to propel the Norwegians to the gold ahead of Russia and Sweden while Dementyev edged Södergren by 0.3 seconds to help Russia earn the silver over the Swedes.\nWomen's event.\nIndividual sprint classical.\nFebruary 22, 2007 at the Sapporo Dome. Emelie Öhrstig of Sweden was the defending champion. Majdič led for almost the entire race, with 20-year-old Jacobsen in second ahead of the season's dominant skier Kuitunen. In the final dash, Jacobsen came from behind to nip Majdič at the line. Majdič won Slovenia's first ever medal in cross-country skiing at the World Championships.\nTeam sprint freestyle.\nFebruary 23, 2007 at the Sapporo Dome. The defending champions in the event were the Norwegian duo of Hilde Gjermundshaug Pedersen and Marit Bjørgen. Kuitunen and Jacobsen earned their second medals of the championships.\n10 km freestyle interval start.\nFebruary 27, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. The Czech Republic's Kateřina Neumannová was the defending champion, and avenged her defeat to Zavyalova in the pursuit race by leading the entire race to win by 26.5 seconds. Neumannová led the entire race while Savialova and Norway's Kristin Størmer Steira were second and third at all three checkpoints. In the final kilometres, Arianna Follis rallied by gaining 11 seconds in the final 1.7 km to beat Steira by four seconds. Zavyalova managed to hold on by finishing 3.7 seconds faster than Follis, but a couple of minutes later Neumannová finished in first place to defend her title.\n7.5 km + 7.5 km double pursuit.\nFebruary 25, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. Russia's Julija Tchepalova had been the defending champion, but was not defending her title due to being on maternity leave. The top three skiers leading at the end of the classical portion were Charlotte Kalla of Sweden (she finished seventh), Kristin Størmer Steira of Norway, and Justyna Kowalczyk of Poland (she finished ninth). Størmer Steira led the field through the first lap of the free style leg of the pursuit, with the lead group down to four in the last lap, including Steira, Olga Zavyalova, Kateřina Neumannová and Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle. Zavyalova led for the entire final lap, and held on in the dash for the finish, while Sachenbacher-Stehle could not keep up with the group and finished fourth. World Cup leader Virpi Kuitunen lost contact with the leading group at the end of the classical leg and did not finish the race.\n30 km classical mass start.\nMarch 3, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. Marit Bjørgen of Norway was the defending champion and would finish ninth. Defending Olympic champion Kateřina Neumannová of the Czech Republic did not start. Kuitunen came in as the heavy favorite for the event given her performance in previous classical skiing events during the 2006–7 World Cup season. Johaug, Steira, and Kuitunen broke away around the 13 km mark, and Johaug remained within the leading group until 19 km, when Steira and Kuitunen pulled away. Kuitunen would beat Steira to win her third gold of the championships, first individual gold, and fourth total medal. The 18-year-old Johaug, who only had two World Cup races in her career prior to this event, would take bronze.\n4 × 5 km relay.\nMarch 1, 2007 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium. Norway's relay team of Vibeke Skofterud, Hilde Gjermundshaug Pedersen, Kristin Størmer Steira, and Marit Bjørgen were the defending champions. Finland lead from start to finish in the event with both Kuitunen and Saarinen earning the fastest times in the classical legs of the competition (13:53.0). Roponen had the fourth fastest time in the third leg (first in freestyle) while Manninen had the tenth fastest time in the anchor leg, but the Finns had too big of a lead and were able to hold off the anchor leg of Germany's Sachenbacher-Stehle. The top three positions after the first leg were Finland, Norway, and Switzerland while the leaders after the second leg were Finland, Norway, and Germany. Sweden's Charlotte Kalla had the fastest time in the third leg (12:32.3), moving the Swedes from sixth to third after the third leg behind Finland and Norway (Sweden would finish fourth in the race) while the Czech Republic's Kateřina Neumannová had the fastest time both in the freestyle and the anchor legs (12:27.8) to move the Czechs from seventh to fifth. Sachenbacher-Stehle passed Norway's Jacobsen with 500 meters left in the race to earn Germany the silver medal by 3.8 seconds over the Norwegians. Pirjo Manninen joined her older brother Hannu in becoming the first brother and sister to win gold medals at the same championships. Hannu had won the Nordic combined sprint and team events earlier in these championships.\nDoping controversy.\nOn February 21, 2007, Sergey Shiryayev of Russia was involved in pre-competition testing for doping with a blood and urine sample. The blood sample in the \"A-test\" turned out high in hemoglobin, so the \"B-test\" was evaluated and confirmed to contain EPO. Shiryayev, who had his best finish of 11th in the 15 km event at the championships, was subsequently disqualified on March 4, 2007. FIS President Gian Franco Kasper expressed both disappointment in Shiriaev's doping actions and happiness in the efficiency of FIS's doping controls. Shiryayev's case was heard in Portnoz, Slovenia at the FIS Council Meeting in May 2007. The result of the hearing was Shiryayev receiving a two-year suspension from the FIS with two coaches receiving sanctions from the Russian ski federation because of this."

However, they could not prevent Germany's Ronny Ackermann from winning his third individual gold medal in succession, thus becoming the first Nordic combined athlete to win three times in succession. \nBill Demong became the third American to win a medal in any event at the Nordic World Ski Championships, four years after Johnny Spillane won gold in the Nordic combined sprint, while the Norwegian skiers, who won three medals and one gold in 2005, failed to defend their team gold without 2005 sprint bronze medallist Kristian Hammer. Austria won no medals for the first time since 1995, with Felix Gottwald being outsprinted for the team bronze and finishing 23 seconds behind the winners in the sprint. The French showed their dominance in the ski jumping part of the competition with a lead in the individual and third place in the sprint, but could not maintain those positions in the cross-country part of the event.\n7.5 km sprint.\nFebruary 23, 2007 at the Okurayama (HS134) jumping hill and the Sapporo Dome. The top three skiers after the ski jumping part of the competition were Kircheisen, Anssi Koivuranta of Finland, and Maxime Laheurte of France. Koivuranta would finish fourth while Laheurte would finish 10th. Manninen edged Moan at the line in a dramatic sprint to the finish. Defending champion Ronny Ackermann (Germany) finished eighth while Olympic Champion Felix Gottwald of Austria finished fifth. The race was marred by a crash during the ski jumping part of the competition that sent Daito Takahashi of Japan to the hospital. Takahasi would not return for the rest of the championships as a result.\nHS134 hill\n7.5 km\n15 km Individual Gundersen.\nMarch 3, 2007 at the Miyanomori (HS100) jumping hill and the Shirahatayama cross-country course. The defending champion of this event was Ronny Ackermann of Germany. Leaders after the ski jumping part of the competition were Lamy-Chappuis (who would finish 17th), Koivuranta, and Bieler. (who would finish fourth). World Cup leader Hannu Manninen (Finland) had a disappointing ski jump part of the competition with a 24th-place finish. Manninen skied the fastest part of the cross country part of the competition (36:31.6) to finish sixth. The real star of the competition was Ackermann, who started fifth after ski jumping and would have the eighth-fastest cross country time to win the event by 8.5 seconds. American Bill Demong had the second fastest time in the cross country part of the competition to edge Koivuranta for the silver. Ackermann is the first person to ever win the event three consecutive times at the World Championships and the first person to win the event at a World Championships or Winter Olympics level since Ulrich Wehling (who was now race director of all Nordic combined events) did it at the 1972, 1976, and 1980 Winter Olympics.\nHS100 hill\n15 km\n4 x 5 km freestyle team.\nFebruary 25, 2007 at the Okurayama (HS134) jumping hill and the Shirahatayama cross-country course. The defending champions were the Norwegian team of Petter Tande, Håvard Klemetsen, Magnus Moan, and Kristian Hammer. Finland took the lead after the ski jumping section, having more than forty seconds on the other teams, and led until the third leg of the relay when Tino Edelmann caught up with Jaakko Tallus. Tallus remained on his trail for the entire race, sending Hannu Manninen and Björn Kircheisen out in the final leg. Like in the sprint, Kircheisen remained in the hunt for two thirds of the race, but lost contact on the final climb. Austria and Norway had already settled for bronze on the second stage, a battle eventually won by Norway. Later in the championships, Hannu's younger sister Pirjo would earn gold in the women's cross country 4 x 5 km relay, making them the first brother and sister to ever win gold at the same championship.\nHS134 hill\n4 x 5 km freestyle"

The Austrian team of Wolfgang Loitzl, Andreas Widhölzl, Thomas Morgenstern, and Martin Höllwarth were the defending champions and successfully defended their title despite Schlierenzauer having the weakest jumps of the entire team. The Japanese team delighted the home crowd by winning their first major medal since their silver medal victory at the 2003 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Val di Fiemme which was also in team large hill. FIS Vice-President Yoshiro Ito, who is also Sapporo 2007 organizing committee vice president and president of the Japanese Ski Association, expressed his delight in the Japanense ski jumping team's bronze medal win in the team large hill competition. Ito also expressed his satisfaction that both the Sapporo residents and the competitors are pleased at the organization of the event has run smoothly so far. Switzerland's Simon Ammann had the longest jumps of both rounds of competition with distances of 136.0 m and 135.5 m, respectively, though his Swiss teammates did not perform as well, causing them to finish seventh in the event.

He played three games in the National Hockey League: two with the Buffalo Sabres and one with the Tampa Bay Lightning between 1991 and 1993. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1989 to 2000, was mainly spent in the minor International Hockey League. He was drafted in the eleventh round, 211th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Sabres. Internationally Littman played for the American national team at the 1994 World Championships.\nPlaying career.\nCollegiate.\nLittman spent four years at Boston College studying communications. In his senior year, Littman served as one of three captains on the team as the Eagles qualified for the NCAA final eight. He ended his season with .912 saves and a .895 percentage. In 2000, his BC record of 2,548 career saves was broken by Scott Clemmensen. As a result, he was selected for the AHCA East Second-Team All-American. He was drafted in the eleventh round, 211th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres.\nProfessional.\nLittman attended the Sabres training camp but was reassigned to their International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans, to begin the 1989–90 season. However, the 1990–91 would prove to be a breakout season for him. On January 29, 1991, Littman made his NHL debut by replacing Darcy Wakaluk in the second period. Littman saved 15 of 18 shots in an 8–3 loss to the St. Louis Blues. Upon their return to the IHL, both Littman and Wakaluk also set a new Rochester record for most points and assists by a goaltender with seven each. He was also selected for the 1991 All-Star Game. Littman shared the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding goaltender, with teammate Darcy Wakaluk.\nThe following year, he was again the recipient of the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award.\nOn August 28, 1992, Littman signed with the new NHL expansion team, the Tampa Bay Lightning. Although he began the season in the minor leagues with the Atlanta Knights, Littman was recalled to the NHL in November 1992. His stay in the National Hockey League was short-lived and he was reassigned to the IHL. He became a free agent at the end of the season.\nAs a result of his successful stints with the Atlanta Knights, Littman was selected to compete with Team USA at the 1994 IIHF World Championship, where they finished fourth in the tournament. Before his retirement, Littman played with the IHL's Orlando Solar Bears, recording 53 wins over two years before a career-ending knee injury.\nLater life.\nAfter working for the Solar Bears as a color commentator, Littman joined EA Sports. He began as a quality assurance associate but later was promoted to producer on the NHL series of games.\nPersonal life.\nLittman was born in Queens, New York, but grew up on Long Island. His family moved to Rhode Island prior to his acceptance to Boston College. Littman was raised Jewish."

        "text": "Sailing Directions are written directions that describe the routes to be taken by boats and ships during coastal navigation and port approaches. There are also products known as Sailing Directions, which are books written by various Hydrographic Offices throughout the world. They are known as Pilot Books, because they provide local knowledge of routes and landmarks, which would typically be provided by a local marine pilot. As such, they are used frequently by naval and government vessels, who are exempted from 'Compulsory Pilotage' in many ports.\nMany nations publish Sailing Directions for their home waters, where they are the International Hydrographic Organization's (IHO) primary charting authority. However, the most widely used Sailing Directions product is the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office's, 'Admiralty Sailing directions' (ASDs)( a.k.a. Pilot books). The ASDs, sold under the Admiralty brand, provide the most comprehensive geographic coverage of coastal routes worldwide. They are designed to supplement and enhance the data shown on British Admiralty Nautical Charts, by describing routes for seagoing vessels, relative to coastal features. Ocean routes are covered by the Admiralty book 'Ocean Passages for The World' (Abbrev. OPTW. Nautical Publication NP136), which describes Offshore routes separately for power driven vessels, and low powered / sailing vessels.\nAmerican Sailing Directions.\nThere is a 42-volume American navigation publication published by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). \"Sailing Directions\" consists of 37 Enroute volumes, 4 Planning Guide volumes, and 1 volume combining both types. Planning Guides describe general features of ocean basins and country-specific information such as firing areas, pilotage requirements, regulations, search and rescue information, ship reporting systems, and time zones; routes describe features of coastlines, ports, and harbors.\nThe American Sailing Directions are available for free download, via the NGA MSI Portal Also, via the Office of Coastal Survey's website, as well as other products, including charts.\n\"Sailing Directions\" are updated when new data requires extensive revision of an existing text. These data are obtained from several sources, including pilots and \"Sailing Directions\" from other countries.\nOne book comprises the \"Planning Guide and for Antarctica\". This consolidation allows for a more effective presentation of material on this unique area.\n\"Sailing Directions (Planning Guide)\" and \"Sailing Directions (Enroute)\" are frequently updated. In early 2005, NGA discontinued production of these publications in printed form; subsequent editions were distributed in digital form only. Between editions, Sailing Directions are corrected via a binary patch process referred to as Publication Data Update (PDU).\nFigure 1 shows an overview of Sailing Directions coverage.\nPlanning Guide.\n\"Planning Guide\" volumes assist the navigator in planning an extensive oceanic voyage, and give information on individual countries that is applicable to all ports in those countries. Each of the \"Planning Guides\" covers an area determined by an arbitrary division of the world's seas.\nIndividual \"Planning Guides\" are divided into Countries and Ocean Basins, as follows:\nCountry entries may contain information on the following subjects—buoyage systems, currency, firing areas, fishing areas, government, holidays, ice, industries, languages, mined areas, navigational information (to include maritime claims, maritime boundary disputes, and enroute volumes), offshore drilling, pilotage, pollution, prohibited areas, regulations, restricted areas, search and rescue, signals, submarine operating areas, time zone, traffic separation schemes, U.S. embassy, and vessel traffic services. Information that cannot be accurately depicted within the alphabeticized country text may be listed as an appendix at the end of the country text.\nOcean casin entries may contain information on the following subjects—climatology, currents, fishing areas, geophysical features, ice, ionospheric disturbance, magnetic field, meteorology, mined areas, navigational information, optical phenomena, pilotage, pollution, regulations, routes, seas, ship reporting systems, tides, and surface temperatures.\nEnroute.\nEach \"Enroute\" volume contains numbered sectors along a coast or through a strait. Each sector is discussed in turn. A preface with detailed information about authorities, references, and conventions used in each book precedes the sector discussions. A table showing conversions between feet, fathoms, and meters is provided. Finally, each volume provides a list of commonly used abbreviations that may be found in the text.\nThe chart information graphics, the first items in each sector, are a graphic key for charts and digital nautical charts (DNC) pertaining to a sector. The graduation of the border scale of the chartlets enable navigators to identify the largest scale chart for a location and to find a feature listed in the index-gazetteer.\nA foreign terms glossary and a comprehensive index-gazetteer follow the sector discussions.\nThe index-gazetteer is an alphabetical listing of described and charted features. The index-gazetteer lists each feature by geographic coordinates and sector-paragraph number.\nSources.\nThe text of this article originated from sections 402 to 404 of the \"American Practical Navigator\", a document produced by the government of the United States of America and amended by marine analysts at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\nUKHO Pilot Books.\nThe UKHO publish a global set of sailing directions under their Admiralty brand. These are available in both hardcopy and digital eBook format."

In 1977, he won the IHSAA 120 yards high hurdles state championship.\nIn 2014, he was inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame.\nCollege career.\nFellows moved on to Butler Community College, where he played as a cornerback for two seasons. He also ran the hurdles.\nHe transferred to the University of Missouri after his sophomore season. As a junior, midway through the 1979 season, he was converted into a wide receiver, posting 4 receptions for 44 yards and no touchdowns. \nAs a senior, he led the Big Eight Conference in receiving with 587 yards on 33 receptions (led the team), while also catching 4 touchdowns (led the team).\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nFellows was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (173rd overall) of the 1981 NFL draft, with the intention of playing him at cornerback. By the eleventh game of his rookie season, he was being used on the nickel defense. \nIn 1982, he played right corner on obvious passing downs, with starter Dennis Thurman being moved to safety. He also led the team in punt and kickoff returns.\nIn 1983, he played nickel cornerback over former first-round draft choice Rod Hill, while posting 5 interceptions (second on the team). Against the New Orleans Saints, he returned a blocked field goal for a game winning 62-yard touchdown, the first such return by a Cowboy in 19 years. He returned an interception for a 58-yard touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings. He also tied a team record with 43 kickoff returns.\nFellows was part of an opportunistic Cowboys secondary that earned the nickname \"Thurman's Thieves\", because of the amount of plays and turnovers they generated. \nIn 1984, after Thurman made the permanent switch to safety, he became the starter at right cornerback opposite Everson Walls, and posted 3 interceptions. He returned a blocked field goal for a 62-yard touchdown against the New Orleans Saints, the first such return for a Cowboy in 19 years. He had 2 interceptions, including one returned for a 58-yard touchdown and 4 kickoff returns for 109 yards against the Minnesota Vikings.\nIn 1985, he struggled with a sprained knee he suffered in the first quarter of the season opener against the Washington Redskins, which caused him to miss 3 games and 2 starts, eventually requiring offseason surgery. He still managed to make 4 interceptions (tied for third on the team) and 20 passes defensed (second on the team).\nIn 1986, he finished first on the team with 15 passes defensed and second with 5 interceptions, including a 34-yard return for a touchdown against the St. Louis Cardinals. He had 4 turnovers (2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries) against the Chicago Bears.\nOn August 2, 1987, after being involved in a contract holdout and the Cowboys needing help at wide receiver, the team felt they had depth at cornerback after drafting Ron Francis, so he was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders in exchange for Rod Barksdale.\nLos Angeles Raiders.\nIn 1987, Fellows was the team's nickel cornerback, appearing in 12 games with 2 starts. \nHe was waived on August 29, 1988, but was re-signed after Terry McDaniel was lost for the year with a broken leg in the second game of the season. He appeared in 14 games with 10 starts at left cornerback, registering 2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. He was not re-signed after the season.\nPersonal life.\nFellows married wife Debra in 2002 and founded the Stars for Life Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at serving Native American communities suffering from addiction, diabetes and suicide. It now educates the public on the long-term dangers of impact sports. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2015."

        "title": "Variations in published cricket statistics",
        "text": "Variations in published cricket statistics have come about because there is no official view of the status of cricket matches played in Great Britain prior to 1895 or in the rest of the world prior to 1947. As a result, historians and statisticians have compiled differing lists of matches that they recognise as (unofficially) first-class. The problem is significant where it touches on some of the sport's first-class records, especially in regards to the playing career of W. G. Grace.\nConcept and definition of first-class cricket.\nThe concept of a \"first-class standard\" was formalised in May 1894 at a meeting of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) committee and the secretaries of the 14 clubs in the official County Championship, which had begun in 1890. As a result, these 14 clubs became officially first-class from 1895 along with MCC, Cambridge University, Oxford University, the main international touring teams and other teams designated as such by MCC (e.g., North v South, Gentlemen v Players, occasional XIs, etc).\nFirst-class cricket was formally defined by the then Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947 as a match of three or more days' duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, with the governing body in each country to decide the status of teams. Significantly, it was stated that \"the definition does not have retrospective effect\".\nThe absence of any ruling about matches played prior to 1947 (or prior to 1895 in Great Britain) has caused problems for cricket historians and especially statisticians. Matches that are believed to have met the official definitions, assuming they featured teams of the necessary high standard, have been recorded since 1697 (having been in vogue since the 1660s). \nIt was inevitable that historians and statisticians would seek to apply unofficial first-class status retrospectively, despite the ICC and MCC's directives. The position is that each writer must compile their own list based on personal opinion: as a result, significant differences may be observed in published statistical records, with particular impact on the career records of W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe. There are also differences in the perceived status of certain matches played by Gloucestershire teams before the county club was formed in 1870, and by Somerset in 1879 and 1881.\nOne of the problems here is that statisticians have tended not to publish their match lists with their findings: it should, however, be noted that the number of differences is extremely small in terms of the sport's overall statistics.\nDevelopment of scoring to 1895.\nThe problem of different versions is as old as cricket scorecards themselves. The earliest known scorecards are dated 1744 but very few were created (or have survived) between 1744 and 1772 when they became habitual.\nThe main source for scorecards from 1772 until the 1860s is Arthur Haygarth’s \"Scores &amp; Biographies\", which was published in several volumes. Haygarth used a number of sources for his scorecards including many that were created by the Hambledon Club and MCC. He frequently refers to earlier compilers such as Samuel Britcher, W. Epps and Henry Bentley. Haygarth often mentions in his match summaries that another version exists of the scorecard he has reproduced. Sometimes he outlines the differences which range from players' names to runs scored and even to apparent discrepancies in innings totals or match results.\nHaygarth first mentions the difficulty of obtaining scorecards in his summary of the Hampshire v Surrey match at Broadhalfpenny Down on 26 August 1773:\nThen, in his summary of the Surrey v Hampshire match at Laleham Burway on 6–8 July 1775:\nHe goes on to list a total of 13 differences between his two versions, some re dismissal details and others re scores. He then makes a highly pertinent comment:\nIn saying that, Haygarth has recognised the essence of the problem when there is no standard means of scoring and no centralised control over the system of capturing and storing the data. Scoring systems in the 18th century and most of the 19th century had nothing like the consistency of standard that was employed through the 20th century to the present. Many early cards gave no details of dismissal. Where dismissal was recorded, it was limited to the primary mode and so a fielder would be credited with a catch but the bowler would not be credited with the wicket unless he bowled out the batsman. MCC finally responded to the problem in 1836 when they decided to include in their own scorecards (i.e., for matches played at Lord's) the addition of bowlers' names when the dismissal was caught, stumped, lbw or hit wicket. Haygarth comments that \"this was a vast improvement in recording the game and but justice to the bowler\". As a result, scorecards became more detailed through the second half of the 19th century but reliability remained a problem and different versions continued to appear. It was some time before the MCC scorecard standard was adopted throughout the country and the inclusion of bowling analyses \"was not introduced until several years afterwards\".\nA greater problem surfaced after 1890 with the establishment of the County Championship because, as described above, this gave rise in 1895 to the concept of first-class cricket and so, for the first time, there was a perceived higher standard based on organisation of games in an official competition. Until then, everything had been somewhat \"ad hoc\" and \"playing standards\" was a term applied very liberally, especially with teams containing guest or occasional players in addition to recognised players.\nCommencement of statistical records.\nEngland.\nThe earliest mainstream publication of cricket statistics was done by members of the Lillywhite family. Frederick Lillywhite, son of William Lillywhite, first published his \"Guide to Cricketers\" in 1848. In 1865, his brother John published his \"Cricketer's Companion\" (known as \"Green Lilly\" on account of its cover). Two years later the two were amalgamated with the Companion \"incorporating\" the Guide. In 1872, their cousin James Lillywhite junior started his \"Cricketers' Annual\" (known as \"Red Lilly\"). A further period of competition ensued until another amalgamation in 1880 created \"John and James Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion\", still incorporating the \"Guide\". This survived until 1883 when James announced he was \"now sole proprietor\". After 1885, the \"Companion\" was incorporated with the \"Annual\", which continued until 1900.\nIn 1864, John Wisden introduced his \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" which, after an uncertain start, went on to become \"the cricketers' Bible\". Meanwhile, Arthur Haygarth published his \"Scores and Biographies\" for Frederick Lillywhite from 1862 to 1871, but these were not statistical as such, rather a record of known scorecards.\nThe concept of a first-class level of cricket seems to have taken hold in the 1860s, perhaps through the influence of the \"Guide to Cricketers\", and W. G. Grace certainly considered his matches in 1864 to have been \"first-class\". Nevertheless, Grace's \"first-class career\" was effectively defined after his death when F. S. Ashley-Cooper compiled a season-by-season record to supplement Grace's obituary in the 1916 edition of \"Wisden\". This record became Grace's \"traditional figures\" and, as described later, was the statistical basis for the celebrations in 1925 when Jack Hobbs passed the total of 126 career centuries that Ashley-Cooper had attributed to Grace.\n\"Playfair Cricket Annual\" began in 1947, but followed \"Wisden\" in statistical terms. In 1951, Roy Webber published his \"Playfair Book of Cricket Records\" and, in his introduction, expressed the view that \"first-class records should commence in 1864\". A number of sources have agreed with this date. Webber then commenced a review of 19th century matches and later published his version of Grace's career record, declaring that Ashley-Cooper had allocated first-class status to a number of minor matches.\nBill Frindall published \"The Kaye Book of Cricket Records\" in 1968, and subsequently several editions of his \"Wisden Book of Cricket Records\": as he explained in the preface to one of the \"Wisden\" editions, he favoured 1815 as the starting point for \"proper\" first-class cricket, though he conceded that there is a reasonable case for several other years, particularly Webber's 1864. Frindall thus included the entire roundarm era, but also a substantial part of the underarm era. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", for which Frindall was the chief statistician, also commences its first-class records section in 1815.\nThe Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) was founded in 1973, with Rowland Bowen among the first to raise doubts in its journal that there could ever be a generally acknowledged list of first-class matches. In 1976, the ACS produced a booklet, \"A Guide to First-class Cricket Matches played in the British Isles\" (with a second edition in 1982), outlining its view of the first-class matches played from 1864 to 1946. This was followed by booklets covering other countries and, in 1981, \"A Guide to Important Cricket Matches played in the British Isles 1709–1863\". \nFrom 1996, the ACS produced a further series of booklets giving complete scorecards of matches from 1801 that it now considered first-class. The ACS gave in its journal a number of reasons for taking its startpoint back from 1864 to 1801, among them an agreement with Frindall's view that the standard of play during the roundarm era were as high as those in the overarm era. The ACS disagreed with Frindall about 1815 because it wanted to include the full set of Gentlemen v Players fixtures that began in 1806. It chose 1801 as a date of convenience, and thereby set up a division between the 18th and 19th centuries, which was contested by several people (including many ACS members) who recognised 1772 as the startpoint given the availability of data in surviving scorecards from that season. In its spring 2006 journal, the ACS admitted that it could not decide upon its position \"vis-à-vis\" 18th century records because of \"missing or incomplete scorecards\". But it is by no means certain that there is a complete statistical record of matches between 1801 and 1825 either, especially given the loss of records in the catastrophic Lord's fire. Certainly, there are no complete bowling figures in that period, or until 1836, and the surviving scorecards are similar in standard and content to 18th century scorecards.\nIn 2005, scorecards and other details of all known matches prior to 1801 were loaded into the \"CricketArchive\" database and there classified as \"major\" or \"minor\" pending an overall accord with other sources about first-class status. \"CricketArchive\"’s \"major\" classification effectively stated a view that the matches concerned were first-class providing they were not single wicket, the other form of top-class cricket that was popular in the 18th century. In early 2010, \"CricketArchive\" reorganised its classification of first-class matches to commence with the 1772 season. The handful of earlier scorecards, including the two in 1744, are arguably too isolated for inclusion: in this sense, the \"statistical record\" is divorced from the \"historical record\" which includes all significant matches, dating from 1697, for which no scorecard has survived. Contrary to Bowen's view, there is now a general accord, apart from a few matters of detail, in terms of statistical first-class status.\nThe issue with using any cut-off date as a startpoint is that it excludes everything before that date, despite cricket's history making clear that there has been a continuous standard of top-class cricket in England since the late 17th century. It is true that none of the cricketers with large career totals played before 1864 (Webber's main reason for adopting that date), and so his startpoint was not really an issue in that context. It does, however, exclude numerous leading players and it impacts other cricket records: if first-class cricket did not begin until 1864, then legendary cricketers like Richard Newland, John Small, William Beldham, Alfred Mynn and William Caffyn were not first-class players. Among records, the lowest known team score occurred in the 1810 match between All-England and The Bs (with Wells and Lawrell), when The Bs were dismissed for 6 in their second innings; that match is not regarded as first-class by those statisticians who still use 1815 or 1864 as their statistical startpoint. The real significance of 1864 was the legalisation of overarm bowling, but there is also evidence of a more structured approach to inter-county cricket which ultimately brought about the introduction of the official County Championship. 1864 was also the first year in which \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" was published: while this is seen as the key source for cricket records, there are plenty of earlier sources.\nThe fire at Lord's occurred on the night of 28 July 1825, when the pavilion burned down and many invaluable and irreplaceable records were lost. It is believed that these included unique scorecards of early matches. The main difficulty encountered by researchers is the absence of match details from before the Lord's fire, and there are numerous matches in the 18th century which are known about in name only, with no scores having survived.\nOther countries.\n\"CricketArchive\" is clear about the first-class cricket startpoints in other countries, and these seem to be agreed by other sources:\nFirst-class cricket in the other Test nations began much later.\nW. G. Grace's career statistics.\nCenturies.\nW. G. Grace began his senior career in 1865 and continued through a record-equalling 44 seasons to 1908. There is general agreement about the status of his matches after the 1895 watershed, but a measure of disagreement about the status of some of his earlier matches. Grace's \"original\" career totals were compiled by Ashley-Cooper and added to his obituary in the 1916 \"Wisden\".\nThe first statistician to make a significant challenge to these \"accepted figures\" was Roy Webber, who published the \"Playfair Book of Cricket Records\" in 1951. This deferred to the \"Wisden\" version re Grace. During the 1950s, Webber made a detailed study of Grace's career and in the February 1961 edition of \"Playfair Cricket Monthly\", he presented his own revised figures by excluding matches he did not regard as first-class.\nIn his later record books (e.g., \"The Book of Cricket Records\", concise edition, 1963), Webber quoted both versions, referring to the \"Wisden\" totals as the \"accepted figures\" and his own as the \"corrected figures\", but excluded Grace's 1873 \"double\" to indicate that he preferred the \"corrected figures\". \nThe same approach was used by Bill Frindall in his \"Kaye Book of Cricket Records\" published in 1968. Webber's \"corrected figures\" were based on a slightly different matchlist to that subsequently created by the Association of Cricket Statisticians (ACS) in the 1970s: the differences here are that Webber included the Gloucestershire match of 1868, but excluded two England v XIII of Kent matches played in 1878 and 1879 and all five Gloucestershire v Somerset matches between 1882 and 1885 (see below).\nThe main issues arising from the disagreement about W. G. Grace’s career totals are as follows:\nAt 1pm on 17 May 1895, in the Gloucestershire v Somerset match at County Cricket Ground, Bristol, Sammy Woods bowled a slow full toss, perhaps deliberately, which W. G. Grace dispatched to the boundary. Woods walked down the pitch and shook hands with the great man who had just completed his hundredth hundred, a century of centuries. It was an occasion for celebration: poems were written, commemorative plates were produced, Grace’s health was widely toasted. WG went on to make 126 career centuries.\nAt the time, it was widely if not universally accepted that Grace's list of centuries included a score of 152 in 1873 for the Gentlemen to Canada Touring Team v XV of MCC, and a score of 113 in 1879 for Gloucestershire v Somerset. Later statisticians have challenged the status of these two matches, and have proposed that Grace in fact completed his hundredth first-class century for Gloucestershire v Middlesex at Lord's on 30 May 1895 when he scored 169. Thus, according to their statistics, WG's career total was 124 centuries.\nOn the morning of 17 August 1925, a Somerset v Surrey match was taking place at County Ground, Taunton. Jack Hobbs, 92 not out overnight, turned Jimmy Bridges to leg and completed his 126th first-class century to equal Grace's career record. Percy Fender brought out a wine glass for Hobbs to enjoy a celebratory drink (as he was a teetotaler, it is reputed that the glass contained only ginger ale). As Hobbs had been near to his century the previous evening, the press were present in large numbers. They departed with their stories and on the next day Somerset recovered from a first innings deficit of 192 to leave Surrey needing 183 to win. Andy Sandham, Hobbs' opening partner, was in no hurry: Hobbs reached his 127th century with the winning runs to break Grace's record and give Surrey victory by 10 wickets. Such was the unexpected nature of Somerset's recovery that only a small crowd was there to celebrate.\nIf W. G. Grace's alternative figures are applied, then Hobbs broke Grace's world record (i.e., his 125th century) on 20 July 1925, when he scored 105 for Surrey v Kent at Blackheath. Hobbs still holds the world record as of 2022, and went on to make 197 or 199 career centuries (see details below).\nGrace's career batting figures.\nThe table below summarises W. G. Grace's career figures with his original totals, as calculated by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and his alternative totals, that now appear on \"CricketArchive\":\nThe \"extra\" 15 innings took place over 10 matches, listed below with his scores in each innings:\n1916 Wisden totals.\nGrace's \"original\" totals were compiled by Ashley-Cooper and added to his obituary in the 1916 \"Wisden\". \nThe only comment there on which matches were regarded as first-class is given on page 96: \nAshley-Cooper compiled Grace's batting averages to the end of the 1896 season, and these were published in a series of articles in \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game\" in late 1896 and early 1897. In the first article, Ashley-Cooper says:\nBetween this 1896 article and the 1916 obituary, Ashley-Cooper omits three matches played by Grace for the South Wales Cricket Club during its tour of the London area in the latter half of July 1865: \nFurthermore, Ashley-Cooper includes the Oxford University v Gentlemen of England match at Oxford in May 1866 which he had previously omitted.\nThis demonstrates that even after 1896, the career figures were sufficiently uncertain that he revised the list of first-class matches. It would have been difficult for Ashley-Cooper to include and exclude matches in which Grace scored a century, but clearly the career run total was sufficiently uncertain that matches in which he did not score a century could be added or removed without much comment.\nOne aspect of Ashley-Cooper's analysis that must be questioned is his assertion that the performances of Grace in a certain match should be regarded as first-class but that performances by other players should not. Clearly, if a match is first-class, then all players taking part must have the match included in their own first-class records.\nIncidentally, the 1896 \"Wisden\" includes Grace's career figures to the end of the 1895 season: this also gives the same number of centuries as the 1916 edition, but his season totals differ in some respects.\n1868 match.\nGloucestershire matches are generally regarded as first-class from 1870 onwards. The 1869 edition of \"John Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion\" (\"aka\" \"Green Lilly\") does not include the 1868 MCC v Gloucestershire match in Grace's first-class figures, but Ashley-Cooper retrospectively chose to add it to his totals for the season.\n1873 matches.\nThe 1873 games typify the loose manner in which statistics were compiled in those days. Grace's first-class batting aggregate for that season included his scores in the MCC matches against Hertfordshire and Staffordshire, and in the North v. South game at The Oval on 26 July. On the other hand, his bowling in the same matches was ignored. \nThe match on 26 July was in fact a one-day filler that was played because the scheduled three-day North v. South match had finished a day early on 25 July: it is questionable if fillers have ever been regarded as major or first-class matches.\nGrace's 1873 first-class aggregate was originally published in the 1874 edition of \"Green Lilly\" which includes the matches quoted in Grace's batting totals, but not in his bowling totals. In the 1916 obituary in \"Wisden\", Ashley-Cooper chose to add the wickets to Grace's bowling total rather than remove the runs from his batting total.\nThe inclusion of those wickets increased Grace's 1873 season bowling total to over 100 wickets, meaning Ashley-Cooper had thereby manufactured the first-ever instance of a player performing the double. In all \"Wisdens\" between 1875 and 1916, the records section has the first-ever double being performed by Grace in 1874.\nThen, having included the three 1873 matches, Ashley-Cooper did the same for two similar matches in the 1872 season: Hertfordshire v MCC and another North v. South filler on 27 July. This is difficult to justify, since these matches were not included in Grace's first-class totals that appear in the 1873 edition of \"Green Lilly\".\nAnother dubious match in 1873 is the one between an amateur team made up of those who had toured Canada and the USA in August and September 1872 and an XV of the MCC. Odds matches are not usually regarded as first-class, but there are exceptions, including two England v XIII of Kent matches played in 1878 and 1879, in which Grace took part. However, in the 1872 match, not only did the MCC team have 15 batsmen, they also had 15 players in the field. \n\"Green Lilly\" says: \"Before the publication of the names of the respective sides there was every prospect of a match at once worthy of the Transatlantic celebrity of Mr Fitzgerald's team and the match-making sagacity of the Club Committee, but when the lists came out, not a few intending spectators of the contest made up their minds for a disappointment. There really did not appear on the side of the fifteen 'metal' enough to encourage the hope of a good fight\".\nStatus of Somerset matches.\nThe remaining area of uncertainty relates to the status of Somerset. Grace played a number of matches for Gloucestershire against Somerset between 1879 and 1885.\nThe 1879 and 1881 matches were not included in the first-class averages in \"Green Lilly\" or \"James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual\" (\"aka\" \"Red Lilly\"). \nIn \"Wisden\" 1882, the editor states: \"As it is, the untiring energy of the executive will be rewarded by seeing Somersetshire\" (sic) \"classed with the first-class counties in the coming season\". This statement clearly indicates that \"Wisden\" did not regard Somerset as first-class in 1881. For the 1882 season, both \"Green Lilly\" and \"Red Lilly\" include Grace's performance against Somerset in his first-class figures and \"Wisden\" remarks that \"Somersetshire's debut among the first-class counties was disappointing\".\nGrace's scores against Somerset in 1883 are included in his first-class totals in \"Green Lilly\" and \"Red Lilly\", and similarly his scores in 1885 are included in \"Red Lilly\" first-class totals, \"Green Lilly\" having ceased publication by that time. \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game\" differs from the annuals and excludes Somerset from its first-class averages for the seasons 1882 to 1885. The Somerset games that involved Grace from 1882 to 1885 were:\n\"CricketArchive\" has Somerset as first-class between 1882 and 1885 but not before then. Thus, Ashley-Cooper chose to retrospectively classify the 1879 and 1881 Somerset matches as first-class, while \"Wisden\" has continued to include these matches in Grace's totals despite the editor's statement in the 1882 edition.\nIt is worth noting that until publication of the ACS lists in the 1970s, Somerset's own publications had treated the club as first-class dating from its entry into the County Championship in 1891. Since the ACS published its lists, Somerset's publications have included the matches between 1882 and 1885 as first-class but not those prior to 1882.\nGrace's career bowling figures.\nAlthough not so controversial, there are also different versions of Grace's career bowling figures. In the 1916 \"Wisden\" obituary, his figures are 51,545 runs conceded, 2864 wickets + 12 wickets taken in innings where the runs conceded is not known, resulting in an average of 17.99. For some unknown reason, the modern publications using these totals have added the wickets totals together (i.e. 2876) and give a resulting average of 17.92. The 2006 \"Playfair Cricket Annual\" is particularly confusing in this regard, as for Alfred Shaw the wicket total is given as 2026+1, indicating the 1 wicket where the runs conceded is not known.\nThe \"Cricket Archive\" totals are 50,980 runs conceded and 2809 wickets taken for an average of 18.15. Many of the differences are because of the exclusion of the 10 matches listed above, in which he took 67 wickets (including all 12 of the wickets taken in innings where the runs conceded are not known). There are, however, a number of instances where the bowling figures differ from those used by Ashley-Cooper. Three of these result in changes to the number of wickets taken:\nJack Hobbs.\nThe situation with Jack Hobbs is simpler than with Grace and relates to a match for The Reef v MCC during the tour of South Africa in 1909–10; and the tour of India and Ceylon by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram's team in 1930-31. He did not score a century in the 1909–10 match but scored two in the 1930-31 tour.\nGiven that he was near the end of his career in 1930-31, his centuries total is subject to variation from this time only, when he had already scored over 170 centuries. Therefore, the date of his 100th century is uncontested, while the date on which he passed Grace's record of centuries is only affected by the differing viewpoints regarding Grace’s own centuries total (that is, 124 or 126).\nThe table below summarises Jack Hobbs' career figures with his original totals, as calculated by \"Wisden\", and his alternative totals, that now appear on \"CricketArchive\":\nThe Reef v MCC 1909–10.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures include this match. \"CricketArchive\" does not. Hobbs scored 39 and 31.\n\"Wisden\" 1931 (part 1, page 329) states:\n\"Wisden\" therefore decided to ignore the ruling and has continued to recognise this match as first-class. \"Playfair\" also recognises the match, but other sources including \"CricketArchive\" have accepted the SABC ruling and do not recognise it. It is possible that the SABC thought it was a two-day match, but \"Wisden\" 1911 clearly states that \"not a ball could be bowled on the first and fourth days\": thus, it was actually planned as a four-day match.\n1930–31 tour of India and Ceylon.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures exclude this tour. \"CricketArchive\" includes it. Hobbs played in 9 matches with 12 innings, 1 not out, 593 runs, 2 centuries. See below re Herbert Sutcliffe.\nAn MCC tour of India was planned for 1930-31, but it was cancelled due to civil unrest. The Maharajkumar of Vizianagram (\"aka\" Vizzy) determined to organise his own tour which included many of India's principal players. In addition, Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe were engaged. The matches were not reported in \"Wisden\" and are not included in its career totals for either Hobbs or Sutcliffe. At the time, \"Wisden\" rarely reported on Indian cricket except for the Bombay Tournament. Vizzy's team also toured Ceylon and played three three-day matches that were similarly disregarded by \"Wisden\". They were however prominently featured in \"The Cricketer\" Spring Annual for 1932. In these matches, Jack Hobbs scored two centuries in Ceylon, while Herbert Sutcliffe scored one century in India and one in Ceylon.\nHobbs himself did not consider these matches to be first-class: \"'Don't include those,' he told the late John Arlott.' They were exhibition matches. Vizzy wanted to list our hundreds on the walls of his pavilion. We knew we'd got to score hundreds - so did the bowling side. They were not first-class in any sense.'\"\nOther cricketers.\nAlthough the variations in career totals are most significant in the cases of Grace and Hobbs, there are differences for many other players too. Clearly the inclusion or exclusion of matches noted above affects the totals of all cricketers playing in these matches and there are other matches where there is disagreement regarding their first-class status. As described above, the sport's early scorecards often show differences in match details which lead to different totals. This is more common with bowling and fielding figures.\nA detailed comparison of differences between various publications was produced by Philip Bailey in 1987.\nBatting.\nOf those who scored 35,000 first-class runs the following are affected.\nLiverpool and District v Yorkshire 1892.\nThis is ranked as first-class by some sources, as are other Liverpool v Yorkshire matches between 1887 and 1894, but this particular match was not reported by contemporary publications. \"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures exclude this match. \"CricketArchive\" includes it.\nSurrey v Essex at Leyton 1896.\n\"Wisden\" 1897 and \"CricketArchive\" have different scorecard data. In the Surrey second innings, \"Wisden\" has Bobby Abel 4 and Tom Hayward 8 while \"CricketArchive\" has Abel 8 and Hayward 4.\nThe Reef v MCC 1909–10.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures include this match. \"CricketArchive\" does not. See above re Jack Hobbs.\n1922–23 Indian domestic season.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures exclude these matches. \"CricketArchive\" includes them.\n1930–31 tour of India and Ceylon.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures exclude this tour. \"CricketArchive\" includes it. See above re Jack Hobbs.\nBowling.\nOf those who have taken 2,000 first-class wickets, the following are affected (this is limited to differences in the games played or wickets taken).\nLiverpool and District v Yorkshire 1892.\nSee above. \"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures exclude this match. \"CricketArchive\" includes it.\nThe Reef v MCC 1909–10.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures include this match. \"CricketArchive\" does not.\n1917–18 Indian domestic season.\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures include Bengal Governor's XI v Maharaja of Cooch-Behar's XI. \"CricketArchive\" does not.\n1918–19 Indian domestic season].\n\"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures include Bengal Governor's XI v Maharaja of Cooch-Behar's XI and MC Bird's XI v Maharaja of Cooch-Behar's XI. \"CricketArchive\" does not.\n1922–23 Indian domestic season.\nSee above. \"Playfair\" and \"Wisden\" figures exclude these matches. \"CricketArchive\" includes them.\nOther differences.\nWhite's difference is sourced to Somerset v Surrey at Recreation Ground (Bath) in 1920. In the second innings, \"Wisden\" has Bill Hitch b White while \"CricketArchive\" has him b Jimmy Bridges.\nInternational cricket.\nTest cricket officially began in March 1877, but the term was applied retrospectively to the early matches, and there have also been instances of retrospective recognition since. \nA key point is that Test cricket is a form of first-class cricket, but is a different form of competition within the concept to, say, the County Championship or the Ranji Trophy. Although several international matches had taken place before 1890, it was not until then that the term \"Test cricket\" was coined by the Australian cricket chronicler Clarence Moody when compiling a list of matches in his \"Australian Cricket and Cricketers\". Moody's list gained approval in Australia, and was then accepted by the leading English authority, C. W. Alcock, who quoted it in \"Cricket\".\nRetrospective Test status has been granted to the West Indies v England series in 1929–30 and the 1945–46 match at Basin Reserve, Wellington between New Zealand and Australia. The 1929-30 West Indies tour is of particular importance, as it was at Kingston, Jamaica on 3 April 1930 that Andy Sandham scored 325: this is considered the first Test score of 300 or more, breaking the record of 287 set by R. E. Foster in 1903. Sandham's record was itself broken in England by Don Bradman at Headingley three months later; at the time, it was Bradman who was considered to have broken Foster's record."

        "text": "The West Torrens District Cricket Club (\"Eagles\") is a \nPremier Grade Cricket Club in Adelaide, South Australia. It competes in the West End Premier Cricket Competition, which is administered by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA).\nThe West Torrens Eagles field senior men’s, three women’s and seven junior teams and are based at Henley &amp; Grange Memorial Oval. Other grounds used by the club include Henley High School, John Mitchell Reserve and Nazareth College (Flinders Park Campus). Previous home grounds have included Lindsay Circus (1857-1921), Thebarton Oval (1921-1988) and Kings Reserve (1988-1997).\nThe club has won 16 1st grade men's Two Day premierships with the last 2-Day win being in 2021/22, breaking a 5-year premiership drought, the same season in which they added another 50 over title. More recently the club won a second Men’s T20 title in season 2023/24.\nIn an amazing 2016/17 season, the Eagles fought off a merger ultimatum from the SACA and became the first ever South Australian Premier club to record a clean sweep of the 2-day, one-day and T20 competition titles. The Eagles have now won 6 West End Cup (One Day) Premierships (1971/72, 1972/73, 1993/94 and 2003/04, 2016/17, 2021/22) and two T20 Premierships (2016/17, 2023/24). During the past decade the club has become one of the strongest in South Australian Premier Cricket, producing many players who at the top of SA cricket. WT have won the SACA Club Championship in 2004/05, 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2011/12. In season 2017/18, the West Torrens Women's 1st Grade emulated their male counterparts by also winning every title available, becoming T20 and One-day Premiers. Most recently the “Sheagles” took out the 2019/20 One day premiership.\nHistory.\nThe Club began in 1857 as the Hindmarsh Cricket Club with its headquarters at Lindsay Circus (now Hindmarsh Stadium) and has continued, with only a change of name in 1897, until the present day, making it the oldest continuous and 2nd oldest existing cricket club in South Australia. Morphett Vale Cricket Club (established 1849) is the oldest cricket club in South Australia.\nThe club moved to Thebarton Oval in 1921 where it remained until 1988 when it transferred to the adjacent King's Reserve. A lack of junior players and inadequate facilities saw a final move to the Henley and Grange Memorial Oval for the 1997-98 season.\nWest Torrens started fielding female teams in the 2007/08 season with many players coming from the former Flinders University Women's Cricket Club. The Eagles have won 1st Grade Women's Premierships in 2008/09, 2012/13, 2017/18 and 2019/20 and were T20 Champions in 2013/14 and 2017/18. They have also won the 2nd Grade Premiership in 2013/14 and 2015/16 and doubled up, also winning the T20 Premierships in the same years.\nTwo books have been published on the history of the club:\nFamous players.\nMany famous names have worn the blue and gold cap. Affie Jarvis, Jack O'Connor, Ron Hamence, Bruce Dooland, Graham Hole, David Hookes and Ian Chappell played Test cricket for Australia while West Torrens players. Merv Waite (Australia), Jeff Crowe (New Zealand), Gladstone Small (England), Jason Gallian (England) and more recently Dom Bess (England) played Test cricket soon after leaving West Torrens. Matthew Elliott also represented Australia before playing 2 seasons for the Eagles after transferring from the Victorian Bushrangers to the West End Redbacks .\nRick Darling, Rod McCurdy and Bradley Young have been Australian one day international representatives and Charlie Walker, Phil Ridings were members of Australian touring teams.\nFormer player and club coach Tim Nielsen also coached the Australian Cricket Team and is now working with the West End Redbacks. Past club captain Callum Ferguson represented Australia, South Australia and the Pune Warriors in the IPL.

        "text": "The Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball team represents Wake Forest University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Through the years, the program has produced many NBA players, among them are Hall of Famer Tim Duncan, 12× All-Star Chris Paul, 1× All-Star Jeff Teague, Sixth Man of the Year Rodney Rogers, and 1× All-Star Josh Howard. The Demon Deacons have won the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament four times, in 1961, 1962, 1995, and 1996. Wake Forest has appeared in 23 NCAA tournaments, most recently appearing in 2017. The current coach is Steve Forbes, who was hired on April 30, 2020.\nHistory.\nDave Odom era (1989–2001).\nIn 1989, Wake Forest would name Dave Odom as its new head coach. During his 12 seasons, Odom led the Demon Deacons to back-to-back ACC men's basketball tournament championship's in 1995 where the team defeated North Carolina and 1996 by defeating Georgia Tech. Tim Duncan would also win back to back-to-back ACC Player of the Year awards in 1996 and 1997.\nSkip Prosser era (2001–2007).\nProsser began his career at Wake Forest in 2001 and led the Demon Deacons to the NCAA tournament in each of his first four years there. Prosser is credited for sparking participation in the Wake Forest student Screamin' Demons and increasing attendance with game-time antics, like having the Demon Deacon mascot enter Lawrence Joel on a Harley Davidson and filling the coliseum with Zombie Nation's \"Kernkraft 400\" at tip-off and when the Deacons would go on a run. During Prosser's tenure as head coach, home season tickets sold out for the first time ever in 2004. During the 2004–05 season, the team was ranked #1 by the Associated Press for the first time in the school's history and won a school-record 27 games. At Wake Forest, Prosser won 100 games faster than all but two ACC coaches. In 2003, his Demon Deacons squad became the first from the ACC to ever lead the nation in rebounding. In the summer of 2007, Prosser had organized what was said to be a top-five recruiting class for the upcoming year.\nEvery senior whom Prosser coached earned his degree in four years.\nDanny Manning era (2014–2020).\nOn April 8, 2014, Wake Forest announced the hiring of Danny Manning. Despite high expectations entering his first season, the Demon Deacons only finished with a 13–19 overall record and 5–13 record in the ACC. They would lose to Virginia Tech in the first round of the ACC tournament.\nIn Manning's second season, Wake Forest's 2015 recruiting class added the commitments of John Collins, Bryant Crawford, and Doral Moore. However, Wake Forest would have another disappointing season finishing the year 11–20 on the regular season and a 2–16 overall record in ACC play.\nDuring Manning's third year at helm, despite losing seniors Codi Miller-McIntyre and Devin Thomas, Wake Forest started the 2016–17 season off very strong. Wake Forest entered the 2017 ACC tournament as the 10th seed and defeated Boston College in the first round of the ACC Tournament. On March 8, 2017, Wake Forest lost to Virginia Tech in the second round of the ACC Tournament. The team also earned a bid in the NCAA Tournament. Wake Forest finished 19–14 on the season and 9–9 in ACC play finishing 10th in the standings. Following the 2019–20 season, after six seasons with the team, Manning was relieved of his duties as head coach.\nSteve Forbes era (2020–present).\nOn April 30, 2020, Steve Forbes was named as the new head coach for Wake Forest.\nSo far at Wake Forest, Steve Forbes has brought a revitalizing energy to the Demon Deacons men's basketball program. After only winning 6 games in his first season with the team, Forbes would marvel in year 2 winning 25 games including 13 in conference play. https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/wake-forest/men/ Known for his strategic acumen and player development skills, Forbes led the Demon Deacons with a blend of intensity and mentorship. Under his guidance, the team has underwent significant growth, both on and off the court. Forbes has emphasized a relentless work ethic and a commitment to excellence, which has translated into tangible improvements in the team's performance. With NIL and the transfer portal taking over college basketball Forbes will need to continue to adapt if he wants to take the Demon Deacons to their first NCAA tournament since 2017.\nFacilities.\nGame day.\nLawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\nThe Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum (also known as The Joel) is a 14,407-seat multi-purpose arena in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It was named after Lawrence Joel, an Army medic from Winston-Salem who was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1967 for action in Vietnam on November 8, 1965. The memorial was designed by James Ford in New York, and includes the poem \"The Fallen\" engraved on an interior wall. It is home to Wake Forest's men's and women's basketball teams, and is adjacent to the Dixie Classic Fairgrounds. The arena replaced the old Winston-Salem War Memorial Coliseum, which was torn down for the LJVM Coliseum's construction.\nBanners hang in the rafters commemorating past players' retired numbers (including Chris Paul, Tim Duncan, and Randolph Childress) and the late Skip Prosser. There are also banners recognizing the Demon Deacons' past NCAA and ACC successes. The arena is home to the Screamin' Demon student section. Wake Forest's black and gold tie-dyed apparel and \"Zombie Nation\" were both implemented upon Prosser's arrival at Wake Forest.\nPractice.\nMiller Center.\nThe Miller Center is the basketball team's on-campus home. It houses the players' locker rooms, team meeting rooms, coaches' offices, and the Dave Budd Practice Gym. The players utilize the Miller Center for practice, meetings, academic work, and relaxing with their teammates.\nThe Dave Budd Practice Gym has a full-length court, six stand alone baskets, bleacher seating and banners honoring some of the best players to ever don the black and gold. The locker room includes a separate player lounge which features multiple large flat screen TVs, multiple entertainment systems (Blu-ray, streaming software, and gaming systems) plus the latest video software, as well as dedicated equipment and training rooms. On August 7, 2018, Chris Paul donated $2.5 million to the Wake Forest basketball program.\nSutton Sports Performance Center/Shah Basketball Complex.\nThe grand opening for the Sutton Sports Performance Center and the Shah Basketball Complex occurred in September, 2019 and provides Wake Forest with a state-of-the-art center for strength and conditioning and nutrition as well as providing space for coaches offices, team meeting rooms, and heritage areas that celebrate the success of Wake Forest's sports programs.\nBen Sutton ('80, JD '83) donated $15 million for the construction of the Sutton Sports Performance Center. The four-level, 87,000 square foot facility provides strength and conditioning facilities for all of Wake Forest's student-athletes. Preliminary site work began in October 2017 and was completed in September, 2019. The facility connects to McCreary Field House and the Miller Center. The Sutton Sports Performance Center provides more than 10,000 square feet of dedicated strength and conditioning equipment for football. There is also space for strength and conditioning equipment for men's and women's Olympic sports.\nThe third floor of the Sutton Sports Performance Center includes 17,000 square feet of meeting rooms, coaches offices and a heritage area for the men's and women's basketball program. The fourth floor has over 18,000 square feet for football coaches offices, team meeting rooms and a heritage area. Over 1,500 square feet comprises a customized nutrition center. The Shah Basketball Complex, named in honor of Mit Shah ('91) whose $5 million lead gift made the facility possible, includes 24,400 square feet that allows both the men's and women's basketball programs to have dedicated practice areas. The $12 million project features the addition a regulation court that allows both programs to have interconnected practice areas featuring two practice courts and a total of 13 baskets. The Shah Complex features 6,000 square feet of strength and conditioning equipment for both the men's and women's basketball teams.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Demon Deacons have appeared in the NCAA tournament 23 times. Their combined record is 28–23.\nNIT results.\nThe Demon Deacons have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) eight times. Their combined record is 13–7.

        "text": "Jerry Michael Johnson (December 3, 1943 – November 15, 2021) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, and Toronto Blue Jays.\nCareer.\nThird baseman.\nJohnson was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent third baseman in 1962. He batted .248 for their Western Carolina League affiliate, the Salisbury Braves in 1962, and committed seven errors in only 29 games for a .868 fielding percentage. He batted .238 with an .872 fielding percentage in 1963, and the Mets began experimenting with him on the mound. He made eleven pitching appearances for the California League's Salinas Mets that season, and had a 6.75 earned run average without a decision.\nWith an .870 fielding percentage in 1964, the notion of Johnson as a third baseman was abandoned, and he was converted to pitcher by the New York–Penn League's Auburn Mets.\nJohnson pitched in the Mets minor league system through 1967.\nFollowing the season, Johnson was obtained by the Philadelphia Phillies from the Mets in the 1967 minor league draft.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nJohnson made his major league debut on July 17, 1968 in the first game of a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park. He gave up two earned runs in one inning of the Phillies' 8–4 loss.\nCurt Flood trade.\nJohnson spent two years with Philadelphia, before moving to the St. Louis Cardinals in a controversial transaction. On October 7, 1969, he was sent by Philadelphia along with Dick Allen and Cookie Rojas to the St. Louis Cardinals in the trade that brought Tim McCarver, Byron Browne, Joe Hoerner and Curt Flood to the Phillies. After Flood refused to report to his new team, St. Louis sent Willie Montañez and a minor leaguer to Philadelphia to complete the trade. Flood believed Major League Baseball's reserve clause was unfair and appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although his legal challenge was unsuccessful, it brought solidarity among ballplayers as they fought against the reserve clause and sought free agency.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nHe was 2–0 with a 3.18 ERA for the Cards when they dealt him mid-season to the San Francisco Giants for Frank Linzy. With the Giants, Johnson emerged as one of the top relievers in the National League, finishing sixth in Cy Young Award balloting during an era when such an honor was rare for relief pitchers. In 1971, Johnson went 12–9 with a 2.97 ERA and eighteen saves for the division winning Giants. In his only post-season, he pitched 1 innings and gave up two runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates in game four of the 1971 National League Championship Series.\nLater career.\nDuring Spring training 1973, Johnson was selected off waivers by the Cleveland Indians. He was traded from the Indians to the Houston Astros for Cecil Upshaw at the Winter Meetings on December 3, 1973. He was released by the Astros at the end of the 1974 season, and signed with the San Diego Padres in 1975. After two seasons in San Diego, he was traded to the newly created Toronto Blue Jays for Dave Roberts, who had just been purchased by Toronto from the Padres. Johnson was the winning pitcher (as a reliever) in the first-ever Blue Jays game on April 7, 1977. Johnson went 2–4 with a 4.60 ERA in the Blue Jays' inaugural season, at the end of which he retired.\nFollowing his major league career, Johnson played with the 1989 St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.\nJohnson died from complications of lewy body dementia, and COPD in 2021 at the age of 77."

It was the club's second triumph in the competition.\nAftermath.\nAlthough Juventus won the 1996 Champions League final, the victory remains controversial because of accusations of doping. The Juventus team has been accused of using erythropoietin (EPO) and the matter went to trial in 2004. In November 2004, club doctor Riccardo Agricola was given a 22-month prison sentence and fined €2,000 for sporting fraud by providing performance-enhancing drugs, specifically EPO, to players between 1994 and 1998, Leading hematologist Giuseppe d'Onofrio said that it was \"practically certain\" that midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi had taken EPO to overcome brief bouts of anemia, and that it was \"very probable\" that seven other players – Alessandro Birindelli, Alessandro Del Piero, Didier Deschamps, Dimas, Paolo Montero, Gianluca Pessotto and Moreno Torricelli – had taken EPO in small doses.\nIn April 2005, the Court of Arbitration for Sport gave the following advisory opinion, in part: \"The use of pharmaceutical substances which are not expressly prohibited by sports law, and which cannot be considered as substances similar or related to those expressly prohibited, is not to be sanctioned by disciplinary measures. However, regardless of the existence or not of any judgement rendered by a State court, sports authorities are under the obligation to prosecute the use of pharmaceutical substances which are prohibited by sports law or any other anti-doping rule violation in order to adopt disciplinary measures.\" In December 2005, Agricola was acquitted of the charges by Turin's court of appeal. In March 2007, in the final verdict by the Supreme Court of Cassation, stated: \"that in the years of 1994 to 1998 there was no ascertained positive case of doping substances by Juventus players, that the purchase of erythropoietin or its administration to the athletes of the club does not emerge from any act of the trial, and that the same expert had identified the possibility of an administration of erythropoietin in distant terms from the sure evidence (\"very probable\" and in two cases \"practically certain\"): it is that therefore, the judgement of probability and not of certainty, did not allow for a statement of responsibility.\" The verdict also went on to say: \"In response to the conclusion taken, the territorial court notes that there were no deferred values higher than the limits set in the various antidoping protocols and that the situation of the Juventus players, both with reference to the average hematological values, and in relation to that of material balance, did not differ from the national average population."

        "text": "Franklin Louis Young (born September 7, 1984) is an American college basketball coach and retired player, currently an assistant at Appalachian State. Young played college basketball for the West Virginia Mountaineers and professionally in several European leagues. Young was commonly referred to as \"Frank The Tank\" by West Virginia fans.\nEarly life.\nFranklin Louis Young was born to Frank B. Young, Jr. and Hattie Mary Young in Tallahassee, Florida. While he excelled as a football quarterback and baseball pitcher in middle school, Young decided to focus exclusively on basketball, where he became a starter on the varsity team at Florida High School as a freshman. As a senior, Young was ranked #164 prospect by Hoop Scoop and was one of the Top 250 prospect by Prep Stars. Bob Gibbons also ranked Young as the 160th best recruit. Young averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds as a junior, but his best season was his senior year. As a senior, he averaged 22.3 points and 10.1 rebounds while being named the Tallahassee Democrat all-Big Bend Player of the Year and 2A Florida State Player of the Year runner-up. Young was also selected to Florida Sports Writers Association's Class 2A all-state squad.\nCollegiate career.\nFreshman season.\nYoung entered West Virginia University during the 2003 campaign. Young played 21 games as a freshman, but only averaged 1.1 points and 1 rebound. Young's best game was when he scored six points against Maryland on two three-point shots. He also scored five points against Kent State in the NIT Tournament. 21 of Young's 23 points actually came on three-pointers. Young competed in the 2004 European tour, where he averaged 7.0 points and 3.2 rebounds. In the last game of the tour, Young scored 21 points against Germany.\nSophomore season.\nIn Young's sophomore campaign of 2004, he played in 32 games, starting three of the contests. Young only averaged 3.3 points and 1.3 rebounds though. His season total of points was 105 though, as he played behind a talented roster of young stars. One of Young's best games of the year came against Coppin State, when he scored four points and grabbed four rebounds. Young's best offensive performance of the regular season came against Providence, when he scored 11 points off of 3-4 three-point shots. Young started his first game of the season against Boston College in the Big East tournament, when he scored a then career-best 14 points, 3-5 of those shots from three-point range. He also started against Villanova in the tourney and against Syracuse in the tourney finals. In the NCAA tournament, his best performance came in the first game against Creighton when he scored eight points.\nJunior season.\nAs a junior in 2005, Young was backup to a prestigious class of seniors, including Kevin Pittsnogle and Mike Gansey. But still, Young started 32 of 33 games played, averaging 7.4 points and 3.5 rebounds. He also dished out 66 assists and shot 40.8 percent from the field. Against Washington &amp; Jefferson, Young scored seven points while grabbing six rebounds for his best performance of his season so far. He then matched his career-high of 14 points against Oklahoma a few games later. Against the UCLA squad, Young scored eight points with five rebounds in the upset win. In the Big East tournament championship game, Young grabbed a team-high five rebounds against Pittsburgh. In the NCAA Tourney, Young played fair during the three games. The Mountaineers tourney hopes ended when Texas ended their run on a game-winning three-point shot. In the loss, Young only scored three points.\nSenior season.\nIn Young's final season of 2006–07, Young posted his best performance yet. With the very young and depleted Mountaineer squad, Young averaged 14.7 points per game and 4.3 rebounds. Young set a career-high of points in the fourth game of the season with 21 points against Montana. Then three games later against North Carolina State, Young scored 16 points with 7 rebounds. The very next game against Duquesne, Young scored 18, followed by 16 points at Savannah State. He then set a career-high 22 points against UConn, and then set it again the next game against Villanova with 25 points. Against in-state rival Marshall, Young tied his season and career-high of 25 points. In the upset win over #2 UCLA, Young scored 14 points along with 7 rebounds. To start the Big East tournament, Young posted 12 points against Cincinnati then 21 points and 6 rebounds against Providence. In the loss to Louisville, Young posted 19 points and 6 rebounds. Young was named to the all-Big East team for his regular season performances. Young's best performances of the season came in the NIT Tournament though, when he opened up against Delaware State with 17 points. He followed up that performance with a career-high 31 points against UMass, then 25 points and 5 rebounds against NC State. Young totaled 73 points alone so far in the Tourney, as the Mountaineers moved to their last NIT semifinal appearance since 1981. In the semifinal game against Mississippi State, won by a Darris Nichols' three-point buzzer-beater 63-62, Young scored 16 points, second on the team, and grabbed 6 rebounds. Two days later, when the Mountaineers won the NIT Championship against Clemson 78-73, Young led the team in one of his best performances with 24 points on just 10 shots from the field and 5 rebounds. Young's final game had him leading his team in points, tied for the lead in the game with rebounds, and was 6-7 in three-point shooting. Young totaled 113 points in the five tourney games of his senior year, which were the greatest games his career as he ended his senior season with strong performances, leading his team to the Championship, and Young was named the tournament's MVP with 22.3 points per game.\nCareer.\nFrank Young has been noted as being one of the greatest three-point shooters in Mountaineer history. Young has made 187 out of 499 three-point shots, racking up 117 three-point shots made alone in his senior season, out of 270 three-points attempted. Young broke the team-record for most three-points in a season in the NC State game in the NIT Tournament of Young's 06-07 season, breaking Chris Leonard's record of 101 treys with his 107 treys after the NC State game.

These charges were dismissed in December 2005 after the accuser decided not to proceed. The other allegation related to an incident in June 2004 where two other members of the basketball team were accused of raping a visiting female basketball player. These two players were acquitted on November 4, 2005, after a trial.\nIt later emerged that men's basketball coach Billy Hahn and women's basketball coach John Miller had known about allegations surrounding the rape of the women's basketball player, but hadn't told school officials about it. However, Hahn and Miller were required by school policy to report the incident to a counselor. This was to ensure La Salle's compliance with the Clery Act, which requires colleges to report information about crime on campus. As a result, Hahn and Miller resigned on July 24, 2004."

        "title": "Basketball playbook",
        "text": "A basketball playbook, like any sports playbook, involves compilation of strategies the team would like to use during games. The playbook starts as a canvas picture of the basketball court with all its boundaries and lines. On top of that, the playmaker can draw O's for players on offense, and X's for players on defense. Specifically however, the playmaker will need to number them for different positions. They are:\nThe following are a list of playbook plays commonly used in basketball throughout the world.\nMan offense plays.\nMan to man offense is commonly referred to as man offense, and as the name implies, the player is matched up with their checks (defender).\nMotion offense.\nMotion offenses are governed by a set of rules which have everyone in motion. When numbers are used in motion (e.g. 4 out 1 in motion), the first number refers to the number of players outside the three-point line and the second number refers to the players inside the three-point line.\nContinuity offense.\nContinuity offense are a pattern of movements and passes, which eventually leads back to the starting formation, and the play can repeat itself again.\nMan defense plays.\nMan to man defense is where the defender follows their check (offensive player) through their movement on the court.\nThe court is divided into four parts. Any number that is in the 40s refers to the full court. Any number that is in the 20s is half-court.\nAny number that ends in '0' means that everyone stays with their check.\nAny number that ends in '1' means that the first pass is double teamed or trapped.\nAny number which ends in '2' means that the second pass is attacked with a double team or a trap.\nAny number that ends in '3' means to fake an attack on the first pass, but then return to normal.\nAny number ending in '4' means that the player that is furthest away from the ball handler, attacks the ball handler.\nHalf-court man to man.\nPack-line defense.\nThe pack-line defense was created by former college coach Dick Bennett while serving at Green Bay using principles from several other man-to-man\nsystems. Bennett further developed the system at his later stops at Wisconsin and Washington State. His son Tony, who played for him at Green Bay and went on to serve under him as an assistant before succeeding him at Washington State, would go on to even greater success using the system at his next stop of Virginia.\nIn this system, one player pressures the ball at all times. The name of the defense reflects the behavior of the other four defenders—they attempt to \"pack\" within an imaginary \"line\" located about 2 feet (0.6 m) inside the three-point line, with the main goal of stopping dribble penetration, only venturing outside the line if their assigned player is preparing to receive a pass. When the elder Bennett first developed the system, he actually taped a \"pack line\" to Green Bay's practice court as a teaching tool, and when he moved to Wisconsin had a similar line painted on the team's practice court. The system has become increasingly popular in 21st-century college basketball. Among the other prominent coaches using the system include Chris Mack (Xavier, now Louisville) and Sean Miller (Arizona). Variations of the system have been used by Ben Jacobson at Northern Iowa and Brad Stevens when he coached at Butler.\nZone defense plays.\nZone defenses requires that a defender cover an area on the court, and does not follow a check, but covers a check that comes into their area.\nInbounding plays.\nWhen the ball goes out of bounds, there are in bounding plays designed to score\nBaseline plays.\nThese plays are used to score, while in bounding, from under the opponent's baseline."

        "title": "Underwater ice hockey",
        "text": "Underwater ice hockey (also called sub-aqua ice hockey) is a minor extreme sport that is a variant of ice hockey. It is played upside-down underneath frozen pools or ponds. Participants wear diving masks, fins, and wetsuits and use the underside of the frozen surface as the playing area or rink for a floating puck. Competitors do not use any breathing apparatus but instead surface for air every 30 seconds or so.\nIt is not to be confused with underwater hockey, in which the floor of a swimming pool and a sinking puck are used.\nHistory.\nUnderwater ice hockey is an extreme sport that requires a considerable amount of breath-holding skills, training, and patience in order to finish unscathed. The sport, UIC, originated in Austria in 2005 when an apnea diver, also known as breath-hold diving, skin diving, or freediving, named Christian Redl from Austria came up with the sport. The idea behind the sport was to take the enjoyment of hockey and turn it into an extreme sport that most divers would be fond of. The first world championship game took place in Weissensee, Austria, in 2007, where teams competed below 12 inches of ice in 35.6 °F or 2 °C water. Water freezes at 32 °F, or 0 °C. At these temperatures, the ice will be thick enough to support the weight of spectators, equipment, and tents to keep people warm while also providing a safe under-ice rink for competitors. This means that finding a location for the matches proved difficult because officials and organizers are required to find an area of ice that was thick enough to hold the weight of all the spectators, and safety officials for the free divers were needed.\nThis 2007 match was the first recorded Underwater Ice Hockey World Championship game; however, this was not the first ever match to be played. There were two matches before this, one in 2005 and one in 2006, where founder and organizer Christian Redl mobilized teams from around Europe to participate. The first match in 2005 was between Austria and Germany, which ended in an 8–8 tie. The second match in 2006 was between Austria and Slovakia, which ended in a 9–8 victory for Austria. Since then, one other world championship game was held in 2013, also at Weissensee, Austria. Both of these matches were organized by founder Christian Redl in hopes of furthering the sport, and over the last 12 years, Redl has been successful in bringing this minor extreme sport to the world; however, due to the nature of the activity, it is still limited to extreme sport enthusiasts and apnea divers. Historically, the aspect of the game that has drawn a lot of apnea divers, especially apnea divers under ice, is the conditions in which the sport is played. It involves a lot of skills that come with free diving, such as holding breath for a prolonged period of time, the ability to disorient between up and down, and the sheer excitement of playing a high-risk sport.\nFounder.\nThe sport was created by free diver Christian Redl with help from his friend and training partner, Jaromir Foukal. Redl started his career in apnea diving after watching the movie The Big Blue, released in 1988, starring Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno, and Rosanna Arquette and directed by Luc Besson. This movie inspired Redl to take his love for diving to another level, and later that year, in 1996, he attended the first world apnea diving championships in Nice, France. In 1998, Redl formed his own team to take part in the second world championships in free diving. In 2003, Christian Redl set his first freediving world record, but this was not the end of his record-breaking career. Over the course of the next decade, Redl would go on to break multiple world records, paving the way for others to follow in his footsteps and break his own records. Some of his world records include line diving under ice with a distance of 200 meters, which he achieved in 2016, and deep dives under ice with a depth of 61 meters and a weight lasting 1 minute and 51 seconds, which he achieved in 2011.\nAfter his experience in apnea diving, Redl took his love for underwater sports to the next level by creating underwater ice hockey while also starting a school to teach people how to properly free dive. Organizer Christian Redl said: \"After diving a lot under ice, I wondered which sports had the potential to be played underneath ice and that's when the hockey game was born. The matches are very fast-paced, so the amount of time that divers are under the water is not that long - plus the water is extremely cold and you can get disorientated very easily.\" Furthermore, Christian Redl has seen some success in television and film by being a stuntman in television broadcasts like \"Medicopter 117\" and \"Coast Guard\" and appearing on the \"TV total\" late-night show with Stefan Raab in 1999. Redl's activities in apnea diving and underwater ice hockey have put him in a good position to be a stuntman. Another thing he has done in his film career was a little-known music video called \"On My Way\" by DJ Friction, which involves underwater ice diving. Also, in 2002, Redl went to Roatan Island to film an advertising film for Seimens Medical, which also involves diving. On top of his film career, Redl has also written some books about his life, projects, and free diving. A couple of these books are called \"Free diving - My World in Pictures\" in 2006 and \"Mastering Boundaries through Mental Strength - Safe Diving\" in 2010. One of the last achievements that stands Redl out from the crowd is that he does not confine himself to one location or hemisphere to do what he loves. He takes his love all over the world, from the North Pole (Greenland and Iceland) to Antarctica, where he continues to push the limits of the human body.\nCompetition.\nThe first Underwater Ice Hockey World Cup was held at Weissensee, Austria, in February 2007. Finland finished first, followed by Austria and Slovakia. The other playing nations were the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovenia. The second Underwater Ice Hockey World Cup was held in February 2013 at Weissensee, Austria, with Austria winning the championship.\nThe first match took place in 2005 and consisted of two teams. The first teams were Austria; founders Christian Redl and Jaromir Foukal, versus the German team of Philipp Von Heydebreck and Knut Stender. This match resulted in an 8–8 tie.\nThe second match took place in 2006 and also consisted of two teams. The first team was again the Austrian team, consisting of Christian Redl and Jaromir Foukal, and the Slovakian team of Erik Tocek and Juraj Karpis. The game ended in a 9:8 victory for Austria.\nThe next match took place in 2007 and was the first world championship. This game consisted of eight teams: Austria, Germany, Finland, Holland, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. The winner of the match was Finland, and the runner-up was Austria.\nIn 2013, the second Underwater Ice Hockey World Championships took place. This game consisted of two men's teams (Austria and Germany) and two mixed teams (Austria B and Germany B). The winner of the tournament was Austria, and the runner-up was Germany. Austria B finished third. The title decider ended in a 9:6 redemption victory for Austria.\nRules.\nRink.\nUnderwater ice hockey is played upside down underneath a 6-meter-wide by 8-meter-long rink in a frozen lake, pond, or swimming pool. Most rinks are 3 × 6 meters, each side fronted by a goal that is fastened to the ice underneath the surface. Some rinks are 6 × 8 meters. The air temperature is generally around . The water is around . As long as the ice is frozen, whether natural or unnatural, it is okay for the players to play.\nThe rink is completed with side hoardings as well, including sponsor names, much like any typical sport, to support the funding for the event. The hoardings are long enough that the puck generally will not go out of bounds. The depth of the water varies, but it is at least over 3 meters, much like a regular pool.\nAir holes.\nSafety precautions are a big part of underwater hockey. Before each game starts, one of the rescue divers uses a chainsaw to cut holes in the rink so the players can get in and get out. Because divers can easily get disoriented during a game, in case one of them is too exhausted to reach the hole or can’t find it, four divers equipped with oxygen tanks supervise every match. Several large holes, 2 x 1 meters, are cut in the ice next to the rink so that players can easily rise to the surface for air. Each hole is marked with a big national flag to avoid confusion. The holes are located perpendicular to the nets (on the long side of the rink where a bench would be located in any sport), where players in hockey would typically sub in and out. The holes are large enough to fit the divers and support divers who could quickly dive in and get to anybody who needs help. Some rinks even have holes in the ice located within the nets in case a diver is not able to swim over to the side of the rink.\nThe players should have good breath-holding skills. Players typically stay underwater for 30–60 seconds before swapping with a teammate, much like they do in hockey when switching from offense to defense. With each breath, a player swaps with a teammate. Players do not typically come up for air, then go back down. Instead, they swap with their teammate every 30 to 60 seconds to allow them to recover. Both teams will generally swap players at the same time in order to keep the game competitive. A well-trained team would know when their teammate needs to switch out. Determining the optimum stick-switching interval is quite tricky. A shorter interval assures the player enough air for a power play, on the one hand, but on the other hand, it increases the time during which both players are under ice, since the stick shift is done during play and, in extreme cases, far away from the breathing hole.\nThey are not allowed to play with any kind of breathing apparatus during competitive play. However, some practice with scuba tanks. The majority of the players, who are called apnea divers, freedive often and have prepared accordingly.\nEquipment.\nParticipants wear diving masks, fins, and wetsuits and use the underside of the frozen surface as the playing area for a floating puck they guide with hockey sticks. They wear the masks to see underwater and have them as tight as they can keep them so they will not get knocked off during play. The fins help propel them to move quicker through the water. The wetsuits help keep them warm in almost freezing temperatures.\nThe hockey sticks are like normal ice hockey sticks. They float in the water in case a player drops them with contact. The puck is usually a 10-inch Styrofoam puck. Because it is Styrofoam, it floats underneath the surface of the ice, so players are playing hockey upside down. There have even been instances of the puck being made of light wood as well. As long as the puck floats, they are able to play.\nGameplay.\nWith a start signal from the referee you would instantly turn belly up under the ice and zoom towards the centre of the field, seeking the advantage accruing to the first to reach the puck. Underwater ice hockey is played one-on-one with teams of two. Both men and women play together and against each other. However, there are four teams that play during each event.\nConsidering matches can get pretty physical, players need to surface about every 30 seconds for a breath of fresh air. Underwater ice hockey periods last 10 minutes, and players are allowed 10-minute breaks to warm up. Just like in ice hockey, they guide a puck into the opposing team’s goal while diving underwater.\nThere are four referees that are equipped with scuba gear and watch over the game, monitoring aggression levels and ensuring that the players are safe. The game is played like regular hockey, except with fewer players. The game can get aggressive as players constantly have to surface for air.\nRisks.\nWhile there have been no serious injuries documented in underwater ice hockey, the game does pose serious health risks. Medical teams are prepared on the surface to treat apnea divers the minute they surface in case of any serious problem or emergency. Ideally, in case of an emergency, the apnea diver would swim back to the entrance in the ice they came from, or the closest one available. If the diver cannot make it to the surface of the water in time, people equipped with oxygen tanks who supervise the game can make sure they make it above water. The rescue/safety squad from there can give medical attention to the player. Players of underwater ice hockey are expected to understand the risks and know how to act accordingly to the given situation. Although there are expert divers and safety divers available to monitor the sport throughout the entire match. Apnea divers are also trained on safety procedures to minimize incidents. Since the game is slower in comparison to underwater hockey or ice hockey, there is a lower risk of puck- and hockey stick-related injuries. In underwater hockey, there is a higher risk of breaking fingers due to a fast-moving puck because players are lower to the ground and, therefore, physically closer to the puck. Underwater ice hockey, however, is played with ice hockey sticks and moves at a much slower pace than both games. Given the freezing temperatures, apnea divers in the sport are at high risk for:\nHypothermia: While usual symptoms are obvious, such as shivering and fast breathing, support divers have to look out for less obvious signs such as dizziness and lack of coordination. Particular dangers of serious hypothermia must be watched out for in the signs so they can make it in time to pull the player out of the water, as signs of severe hypothermia cannot be seen underwater. Slurred speech, confusion, no concern for the condition from the player, a weak pulse, and shallow breathing must be closely monitored and treated immediately.\nAsphyxiation: Underwater ice hockey is typically played without breathing apparatus. Only supervising divers wear oxygen tanks while playing; apnea divers wear diving masks for visibility. To prevent loss of consciousness due to lack of oxygen, players are switched every thirty to sixty seconds. Supervising safety divers can assist an apnea diver if they are unable to reach the surface before losing consciousness. So far, the safety teams have been able to retrieve everyone.\nFrostbite: With the frozen temperatures, medical teams must be on alert for any signs of frostbite. While there have been no recorded incidents, the risk of frostbite is very high. Most are not fully aware of the signs of frostbite, as they could come off as typical discomforts. Frost-nip is the earliest of frostbite, where skin may get irritated and turn red. Other signs include itchiness or a burning feeling in the afflicted area. Affected skin may turn shiny or hard before going into the final stages of frostbite. Most are unaware of when they are at risk for frostbite because the affected area eventually loses feeling, and people suffering from frostbite may feel warm even though their skin is cold to the touch. Medical teams must be wary of early signs of frostbite before the final stage, where skin turns blue and nerve damage occurs. Treatment for frostbite is to immediately choose means that increase blood flow in those areas to minimize damage. Dead skin must be removed, and the subject must be warmed. Pain medication is typically administered for nerve pain that can occur during the warming process. For minor frostbitten conditions, ibuprofen pain relievers may be used to reduce inflammation. Blood thinners may also be taken to help prevent damage to nerves. The first response to treatment for frostbite is to dry the skin off and take the patient indoors to warm up.\nMost risks are preventable with the use of exposure suits. Wetsuits are typically pre-warmed with warm water in order to keep divers warm throughout a frozen competition. Three-finger mitts are usually recommended. Smaller body parts such as fingers, toes, ears, and the nose are at the highest risk for frostbite and are the most vital to keep covered and warmed. Divers are also warned against heavy exercise after resurfacing from the ice. Decompression sickness has not been studied enough for the extreme cold, and any measures taken to prevent it is recommended.\nSponsors.\nSponsors, such as Omega, sponsored the tournament in Austria at Weissensee in 2007; furthermore, any organization, company, or individual may sponsor the matches or a championship game. However, unlike in ice hockey, where sponsor banners are plastered on the walls of the rink, in underwater ice hockey, banners are attached under the ice on either side of the goal posts so that they may be seen while the game is recorded underwater.\nSpectators.\nBecause the game is not played in an arena where spectators can see apnea divers through a monitor that is set on top of the ice, the spectators have to sit on top of the surface of the ice to watch the game being played underwater. This is done by a cameraman that follows the game underwater, recording the action while apnea divers compete under the ice, making it possible for others to watch the game above the ice. Unlike most professional games, the monitor watched is not a large screen that is visible to a large audience. Instead, it is an average-sized monitor (about 27 inches diagonally), which is then protected from the elements with a tarp. Resurfaced players are also able to view the game on the monitor before switching out with their teammate.\nSpectators should dress appropriately for the conditions. The safety teams are there for the benefit of spectators and players alike."

        "text": "The 2007–08 UEFA Champions League was the 16th season of UEFA's premier European club football tournament, the UEFA Champions League, since it was rebranded in 1992, and the 53rd tournament overall.\nThe final was played on 21 May 2008 at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, where Manchester United played against Chelsea, making it an all-English final for the first time in the history of the European Cup. Manchester United won the match 6–5 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw after extra time.\nMilan were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Arsenal in the first knockout round.\nQualification.\n76 teams participated in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League from 52 UEFA member associations (not including Liechtenstein). Each association enters a certain number of clubs to the Champions League based on its league coefficient which takes into account the performance of its clubs in European competitions from 2001–02 to 2005–06.; associations with a higher league coefficients may enter more clubs than associations with a lower league coefficient, but no association may enter more than four teams. All UEFA associations are guaranteed to have at least one team qualify, with the exception of Liechtenstein, which competes in the Swiss league system, but has no team in the Swiss Super League. One new nation entered their league champion in this year's tournament: Montenegro, following the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro. The champions from San Marino and Andorra also entered from this year onwards. Below is the qualification scheme for the 2007–08 Champions League:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2006 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2001–02 to 2005–06.\nDistribution.\nSince the title holders (Milan) qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round through their domestic league and entered the group stage automatically, their spot in the third qualifying round is vacated, and the following changes to the default access list are made:\nRound and draw dates.\nThe calendar shows the dates of the rounds and draw.\n1 Group D teams played their Matchday 6 fixtures on 4 December due to Milan's participation in the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan on 13 and 16 December.\n2 As both Milan and Internazionale use the San Siro as their home pitch, and both teams were seeded and scheduled to host the second leg of the first knockout round at home, Internazionale's home leg against Liverpool was postponed by one week to 11 March 2008 to accommodate AC Milan, who were the title holders.\nQualifying rounds.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe draw was held on Friday, 29 June 2007 in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Michele Centenaro, UEFA's head of club competitions. The first leg matches were held on 17 July and 18 July, while the second legs were played on 24 July and 25 July 2007.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe draw was held on Friday, 29 June 2007 in Nyon, Switzerland.

The draw was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA's director of professional football. The first leg matches were played on 14 August and 15 August, while the second legs were played on 28 August and 29 August 2007. Winners in this round qualified for the group stage, while the losing clubs entered the first round of the UEFA Cup. Due to the death of Antonio Puerta, the second leg of Sevilla's game against AEK Athens was postponed until 3 September.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw was held on Thursday, 30 August 2007 at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The draw was hosted by Pedro Pinto and conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Michele Centenaro, UEFA's head of club competitions. The matches were played between 18 September and 12 December 2007.\nThe top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage, and the third-placed teams entered the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup. Based on paragraph 6.05 in the UEFA regulations for the current season, if two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings:\nSevilla and Slavia Prague made their debut appearance in the group stage.\n\"In results tables, the home team is listed in the left-hand column.\"\nKnockout phase.\nFrom the last 16 through to the semi-finals, clubs play two matches against each other on a home and away basis with the same rules as the qualifying rounds applied. In the last 16, group winners play runners-up other than teams from their own pool or nation.\nThe draw for the first knockout round was held on Friday, 21 December 2007 in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA's director of professional football.\nThe draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals were both held on Friday, 14 March 2008 in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Rinat Dasayev, the ambassador for the final in Moscow. Unlike the first knockout round, teams from the same group or country may be drawn together from the quarter-finals onwards.\nRound of 16.\nThe first leg matches were played on 19 February and 20 February, while the second legs were played on 4 March and 5 March 2008. Due to a stadium clash with Milan, the second leg of Internazionale's game against Liverpool was held on 11 March.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first leg matches were played on 1 April and 2 April, while the second leg matches were played on 8 April and 9 April 2008.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first leg matches were played on 22 April and 23 April, while the second leg matches were played on 29 April and 30 April 2008.\nFinal.\nThe 2008 UEFA Champions League Final was played on 21 May 2008 at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. The final was contested by Manchester United and Chelsea, representing the first time the final had been contested by two teams from England.\nUnited won the match 6–5 on penalties after the game had ended in a 1–1 draw. Cristiano Ronaldo had given the eventual victors the lead after 26 minutes, only for Frank Lampard to equalise immediately before half-time. Ryan Giggs came on as a substitute late in the second half to make his 759th appearance for Manchester United, a new club record. Early in extra time, Giggs had a shot cleared off the Chelsea goal-line by John Terry, whilst Chelsea twice hit the Manchester United woodwork. A melée involving most of the 22 players ensued midway through the second half of extra time, with Didier Drogba being sent off for a slap on Nemanja Vidić right in front of the referee.\nThe scores level at full-time, the match went to penalties. Chelsea took the upper hand in the third round of the shoot-out as Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty was saved by Petr Čech, handing John Terry the chance to win the cup with Chelsea's fifth penalty. However, Chelsea's captain lost his footing as he went to kick the ball, and his shot hit the post. Ryan Giggs stepped up for United's seventh penalty, and scored, before Edwin van der Sar saved the following kick from Nicolas Anelka to crown Manchester United as the champions of Europe for the third time.\nAs winners of the competition, Manchester United went on to represent Europe at the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds."

        "text": "Thomas Ray Williams (October 14, 1954 – March 22, 2013) was an American professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association from 1977 to 1987. Born in Mount Vernon, New York, he was the younger brother of Gus Williams, who also played in the NBA.\nHigh school and college careers.\nWilliams attended Mount Vernon High School and helped lead the school to two New York State basketball championships.\nAfter attending San Jacinto Junior College, Williams played at the University of Minnesota from 1975 to 1977. During that time, he averaged 18.9 ppg and 6.6 rpg.\nNBA career.\nWilliams was selected by the New York Knicks in the first round of the 1977 NBA draft (10th pick overall).\nAfter a quiet first season, he improved his effectiveness on the court, averaging 20.9 ppg, 5 rpg, and 6.2 apg during his third season (1979–80) and becoming the team captain during his fourth season. During his time with the Knicks, he reached the NBA playoffs twice.\nAfter four seasons with the Knicks, Williams was traded to the New Jersey Nets on October 25, 1981, in exchange for Maurice Lucas. With the Nets, Williams averaged 20.4 ppg, 4 rpg, and 6 apg (1981–82 season). On April 17, 1982, Williams scored 52 points in a game against the Detroit Pistons, for the highest-scoring game of his career, and the highest in Nets history until he was surpassed by Deron Williams' 57-point game on March 4, 2012. Williams eventually helped the Nets reach the 1982 NBA Playoffs where he averaged 17 ppg, 6 rpg, and 7 apg. However, they ended up being eliminated by the Washington Bullets in the first round.\nOn June 29, 1982, the Nets traded Williams to the Kansas City Kings for Phil Ford. After one season, they traded him back to the New York Knicks for Billy Knight and an amount of cash. He reached the playoffs once again with the Knicks, averaging 11.2 ppg and 8 apg.\nIn the middle of the 1984–85 season, Williams signed as a free agent with the Boston Celtics, in exchange for two future draft picks. During this year, he had the chance to play with Larry Bird and Kevin McHale. With Boston, he reached the playoffs one last time. This time, the Celtics reached the Finals, but were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers.\nBefore the 1985–86 season, Williams signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, with Boston receiving a future draft pick as compensation. The Clippers, however, waived him before the season began.\nWilliams eventually signed with the Atlanta Hawks. After 19 games, he was waived by the Hawks, but signed with the San Antonio Spurs later. After 23 games, he was also waived by the Spurs and claimed by the Nets. Williams played the remainder of the season with them and remained with the team during the next season, after which he retired. Williams ended with a career average of 15.5 ppg, 5.8 apg, and 3.6 rpg.\nPost-NBA career.\nAfter his retirement, Williams struggled financially, eventually filing for bankruptcy in 1994, which led him to lose his home and family. Williams decided to apply early for his NBA pension of $200,000. After he received it, he moved to Florida, where he fell victim to a real estate scam that worsened his financial condition.\nAfter that, Williams worked various jobs like groundskeeper at a golf course in Central Florida, apartment complex maintenance man, part-time girls basketball coach, and bakery worker, among others. During that time, he also received grants from the NBA Retired Players Association, totaling $10,000, which couldn't help his situation.\nAccording to a profile published in \"The Boston Globe\" in July 2010, he was unemployed and homeless, living inside a car in Pompano Beach, Florida. Williams spent his time fishing at the Hillboro Inlet Park in Pompano Beach, to help maintain himself. In November 2010, Williams' luck began to turn around as he took a job in Mount Vernon, New York, working for the city's Recreation Department as a \"Recreation Specialist.\" Mount Vernon Mayor Clinton I. Young, Jr. was instrumental in bringing Williams back to his hometown. Williams was also helped by Linda Crawford, a nurse and a friend from his NBA days. Williams married Linda Crawford in August 2011.\nDeath.\nWilliams died March 22, 2013, at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York City after suffering from colon cancer. Williams was 58."

        "title": "Line (ice hockey)",
        "text": "In ice hockey, a line is a group of forwards who play in a group, or \"shift\", during a game.\nA complete forward line consists of a left wing, a centre, and a right wing, while a pair of defencemen who play together are called \"partners\". Typically, an NHL team dresses twelve forwards along four lines and three pairs of defencemen, though some teams elect to dress a seventh defenceman, or a thirteenth forward. In ice hockey, players are substituted \"on the fly,\" meaning a substitution can occur even in the middle of play as long as proper protocol is followed (under typical ice hockey rules, the substituting player cannot enter the ice until the substituted player is within a short distance of the bench and not actively playing the puck); substitutions can still be made during stoppages. Usually, coordinated groups of players (called linemates) are substituted simultaneously in what are called line changes. Linemates may change throughout the game at the coach's say.\nIce hockey is one of only a handful of sports (gridiron football and basketball being the two most prominent others) that allows for unlimited free substitution and uses a system of multiple sets of players for different situations. Because of the use of lines in hockey, ice hockey teams have relatively large rosters compared to the number of players on the ice (23 for a typical NHL team, with 20 active on game day and six on the ice at any given time). Only gridiron football has a larger relative roster size (the NFL has 53 players, 46 active on gameday, 11 on the field).\nTypes of line.\nDefence.\nDefencemen operate in pairs rather than trios. The top pairing consists of the two strongest defenders on the team, and may play up to 30 minutes per game. Offensive defencemen may be placed on any pairing, while \"stay-at-home\" defenders typically play on the third pair. Coaches may also choose to pair a more offensively-minded defender with a more defensive player."

        "text": "In climbing, a topo (short for topology) is a graphical representation of a climbing route. Topos range from a photograph of the climb on which the line of the route is overlaid, to a detailed diagram of the key features and challenges of the climb (often represented as standardized symbols). \nClimbing guidebooks compile topos for routes at a crag or in a climbing area. Online climbing databases and apps merge detailed beta (i.e. how to overcome the hardest challenges) as well as the traditional topo information. Some hand-drawn topos by the climber(s) who completed the first ascent of important new routes are notable.\nDescription.\nThe term \"topo\" means \"topographical\" information, which has historically meant showing the climber not just the basic line of the route, but also the key rock (or topological) features that defined the route. This would help to guide the climbers along the route and also to prepare them for the specific types of technical challenges that lay ahead. Such topological features include cracks, overhangs and roofs, slabs, and dihedrals.\nModern topos for single-pitch climbing routes, tend to be limited to photographs on which the line of the route is overlaid, and are often presented in groups where multiple routes are shown for a given section on a single photograph for a section of the rock face. Such topos assume that the climber can inspect the route from below and will be aware of the main obstacles that lay ahead.\nLong climbing routes, such as those found in multi-pitch climbing, big wall climbing, and alpine climbing, have far more detailed topos (often in complex route diagrams), so that the climbers don't veer off the route (a major issue for long routes, and a serious one on exposed rock and alpine faces), and so that they are aware of important belaying, abseiling, and portaledge/bivouac points. The topos of longer routes also provide detailed information on the variations in the technical grade of each pitch of the route, the availability of climbing protection (e.g. pitons and bolts), as well as options and variations on the route (e.g. easier variations around difficult obstacles).\nSymbols.\nTopos often use standardized symbols or icons to represent the features and obstacles along the route. A notable example are the UIAA recommended symbols that were proposed for use in guidebooks, particularly for long alpine and big wall climbing routes. The UIAA list includes over 30 standardized symbols that cover a range of important information for any climbing route, and they are still in use today (see images opposite).\nOther climbing guidebook publishers (e.g. such as 'RockFax'), have also developed their own customized symbols and icons that they use to augment their topo diagrams and photographs.\nOnline.\nThe development of interactive online apps and detailed databases of climbing routes has dramatically increased the detail of topos (e.g. providing detailed YouTube videos on how to climb a route including key movements and sections). Topo diagrams are increasingly interactive, and sometimes three dimensional, where the climber can scroll through a climb to examine every feature in rich detail. With such data, the line between traditional topo information and detailed beta information is increasingly blurred.\nFirst ascent.\nThe climber(s) who make the first ascent and/or first free ascent of multi-pitch routes will typically hand-draw the first topo of the new climb to clarify the route they have completed, and their assessment of the main obstacles and their technical grade. Subsequent climbers will update/amend these topos as they ascend the route. Some hand-drawn topos have become iconic in climbing, and the hand-drawn topos of notable big wall climbs, such as many famous routes on El Capitan, are preserved in the climbing media."

Kelly was a member of The Parramatta side's that made 3 preliminary finals in a row but ultimately fell short of a grand final appearance.\nBackground.\nKelly was born in Taroom, Queensland.\nPlaying career.\nKelly made his first grade debut for the Gold Coast in Round 18 1995 against St George which ended in a 46-16 loss. In 1996, Kelly joined Parramatta and became a regular fixture in the team over the next 5 years.\nIn 1998, Kelly played in all but 1 of the club's matches as they finished 4th on the table and qualified for the finals. Kelly played in all of Parramatta's finals games including the heartbreaking preliminary final loss against Canterbury-Bankstown.\nWith Parramatta leading 18-2 with less than 10 minutes to play, Canterbury staged a comeback scoring 3 tries in 8 minutes with Canterbury player Daryl Halligan kicking 2 goals from the sideline to tie the game at 18-18. Parramatta player Paul Carige then made a series of personal errors which cost Parramatta dearly in extra time with Canterbury going on to win 32-20.\nIn 1999, Parramatta finished 2nd and qualified for the finals again. Parramatta once more reached the preliminary final against Melbourne. Parramatta lead the match 16-0 at halftime before a second half capitulation occurred similar to the year earlier with Melbourne winning the game 18-16.\nIn 2000, Kelly played 28 games as Parramatta reached their 3rd straight preliminary final against Brisbane. That season, the club was dubbed the \"Baby Eels\" by the media with the average of the squad being 23 years old. Parramatta lost the match 16-10 against the eventual premiers. This in turn would prove to be Kelly's last match for Parramatta and he joined Brisbane for the 2001 season.\nHaving won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos travelled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Kelly playing at centre in Brisbane's loss.\nIn 2001, Kelly played in 16 matches for Brisbane as they reached the preliminary final against his former side Parramatta. Brisbane lost the match 24-16. Kelly played with Brisbane up until the end of 2005 before retiring. Kelly's last match in first grade was against Canberra in Round 14 2005."

Young was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1999.\nIn addition to achieving a bowl game record of 5–1, Young was the interim coach for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team during the 1970 Rose Bowl, as Bo Schembechler was hospitalized following a mild heart attack.\nCoaching career.\nPurdue.\nIn December 1976, Purdue University hired a 41-year-old Young away from Arizona. When Young arrived at Purdue, he named true freshman, Mark Herrmann as the team's starting quarterback, and the freshman lived up to expectations, throwing for 2,041 yards through the team's first eight games. Herrmann broke the NCAA record for passing yards (2,453) and passing touchdowns (18) for freshman. In 1978, Young lead Purdue to a 9–2–1 record, and a victory over Georgia Tech in the 1978 Peach Bowl. Young was named the Big Ten's Coach of the Year, the first Boilermaker head coach to ever win the award. Throughout his career, Herrmann would break the Big Ten's all-time career passing yards (6,734) and passing touchdowns (48) before his senior season. After a disappointing 1981 season, Young resigned from his position as head coach at Purdue, citing his desire to concentrate on athletic administration."

        "text": "The Maryland Terrapins women's basketball are an American basketball team. The team represents the University of Maryland in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I competition. Maryland, a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), left the ACC in 2014 to join the Big Ten Conference. The program won the 2006 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament championship and has appeared in the NCAA Final Four five times (1982, 1989, 2006, 2014, 2015); Maryland also appeared once in the AIAW Final Four (1978). As members of the ACC, the Terrapins won regular season conference championships (1979, 1982, 1988, 1989, 2009) and an ACC-record ten conference tournament championships (1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1988, 1989, 2009, 2012). The program won the Big Ten Conference regular season and tournament championships in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2021.\nSince 2002, the team has been led by head coach Brenda Frese. Over her 20 season tenure, she has led the Terrapins to 17 NCAA tournament appearances, ten NCAA Sweet Sixteens, six NCAA Elite Eight, three NCAA Final Fours, and the 2006 NCAA National Championship.\nHistory.\nWomen's basketball was first organized to play on campus in 1923. The early teams participated solely in intracollegiate competition, with classes or sororities competing against each other for a trophy. The team was officially recognized as a varsity sport in 1971, and was led by coach Dottie McKnight during its first four seasons. The Terps were successful from the start, winning their first state championship in the 1972–73 season. They went on to win ten ACC championships and one NCAA title.\nOn January 26, 1975, the Terps played host to Immaculata in the first nationally televised women's college basketball game. The game took place in Cole Field House. Some sources report that Immaculata won 80–48, while others report 85–63. On March 9, 2019, Maryland won its 1000th game, becoming the 14th (unsure, based on 2017 data) team to win 1000 games. It did so at home against Michigan in the Big Ten Semifinals, which it won by a score of 73-72.\nThe team has been led by three head coaches: Dottie McKnight (1971–1975), Chris Weller (1975–2002), and Brenda Frese (2002–present). Although McKnight only coached four seasons of Terps basketball, she quickly led her new team to success. She left with a record of 44–17 (.721). Weller, a University of Maryland alumna ('66) and former Terps player, took over the head coaching position in 1975. She led the Terps to numerous national championship appearances and a total of eight ACC championship titles. When she retired, Weller left with a 499–286 record (.636). At the end of the 2018–19 season, current coach Brenda Frese has a record of 458–124 (.787). She has also led her team to a national championship title, eight national championship appearances, and two conference championship titles. Frese is known for her recruiting skills, with Shay Doron being credited as her first major recruit.\nNotable players.\nMany Terps have gone on to national prominence, appearing in the Olympics and playing in professional leagues.\n2007–08 season.\nHead coach Brenda Frese announced during the pre-season that she was pregnant. Because of this, she was unable to coach from the sidelines for most of the regular season. Newcomer assistant coach Daron Park would take on the role of acting head coach. With the coaching changes, the Terps improved to a 30–3 record, and ranked 5 and 6 in the AP and Coaches polls respectively. Key returning players include Marissa Coleman, Laura Harper, Crystal Langhorne, and Kristi Toliver, all of whom were on the 2006 NCAA Championship team. With the loss of Shay Doron, whose #22 jersey was honored this season, Frese brought in 5 recruits. Two weeks after giving birth to twin boys, Frese returned to the sidelines during the ACC women's basketball tournament. Maryland eventually lost to Duke in the semifinals.\nPostseason results.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Terrapins made four appearances in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 13–1.

As a young boy, he grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan.\nHigh school career.\nÁlvarez first attended the Mott Hall School for gifted and talented students in Morningside Heights, where he was an A student. He then attended the prestigious Horace Mann School in the Bronx, choosing a school known for its high-level education but not for its sports programs. Álvarez holds numerous baseball records there, most notably home runs, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and RBIs. Álvarez was named Athlete of the Year his senior season. Though he attended a private school, Álvarez's abilities attracted the attention of scouts throughout the New York City area, especially after he led his club team, the Bayside Yankees, to a national title in 2005. In recognition of his success, Louisville Slugger crowned him the Player of the Year in New York and also named him to its All-America team.\nVanderbilt career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Álvarez was drafted in the 14th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft by the Boston Red Sox. Though offered a substantial signing bonus, Álvarez instead chose to play college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores of the Southeastern Conference. Álvarez started slowly at Vanderbilt but eventually became an integral member of the lineup, setting a single-season school record in home runs (22). This production earned Álvarez National Freshman of the Year honors from several publications, including \"Baseball America\". Álvarez was then selected to the USA National team, leading the team in batting average. \"Baseball America\" ranked him as the second-best pro prospect on the squad. In addition, \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked him as the best pro prospect on the team and said that he was the \"early favorite to be drafted first in 2008\", due to his impressive performance over the summer and as a freshman.\nBefore the 2007 season began, Álvarez was named to the watchlist for the SEC and National Player of the Year awards. He was also chosen as a pre-season first team All-American. During the season, Álvarez hit .397 with 17 home runs, 65 RBI, 72 runs scored, an on-base percentage of .467, and a slugging percentage of .706 for the 51–11 Commodores. Vanderbilt captured its first ever SEC regular season championship, and Álvarez was named Tournament MVP.\nÁlvarez was invited back to Team USA after his strong performance in 2006. He led the team in homers, RBI, batting average, hits, and slugging percentage.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates selected Álvarez in the first round, with the second overall selection, in the 2008 MLB draft. He agreed to a $6 million minor league contract with the Pirates on August 15, minutes before the deadline, but did not immediately sign it. He was placed on the restricted list after the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance against Major League Baseball over draft picks being signed minutes after the August 15 deadline. On September 22, Álvarez agreed to renegotiated terms on a four-year major league contract at $6.4 million.\nIn 2009, Álvarez attended Spring training with the Pirates and was assigned to the minor league's spring training on March 16, 2009. After playing several months with the Pirates High-A affiliate, Lynchburg Hillcats, Álvarez was assigned to Double-A Altoona Curve in late June. Álvarez led the Pirates organization in home runs and RBI with 27 and 95 respectively. He also batted .288 with an .917 OPS.\n2010.\nÁlvarez started the 2010 season with the Pirates Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, as the 8th-best prospect in Baseball America's 2010 rankings. In 66 games with the Indians, he hit .277 with 13 home runs, 53 RBI, and 4 stolen bases.\nÁlvarez was called up to the MLB on June 16, 2010, and made his MLB debut against John Danks of the Chicago White Sox. He went 0-for-2 with a walk, a strikeout, and a run scored. His first MLB hit came against the Cleveland Indians on June 19, an RBI double off Indians starter David Huff. The following several weeks of his career did not go so smoothly, however. He struck out at least once in each of his first 10 games, capped off by a 4-strikeout game in a 14–4 loss to the Oakland Athletics on June 25. Pirates manager John Russell then gave him a day off. His first MLB home run came against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 3, 2010, a solo shot to left field off of Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick. Following his benching, Álvarez responded with an eight-game hitting streak from June 28 – July 6 that included 2 home runs, 3 runs scored and 4 RBI.\nÁlvarez recorded his first MLB career multi-homer game on July 20, 2010 against the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit a grand slam in the first inning off Brewers starter Dave Bush and then followed with a solo home run in the following inning. He finished the game 2-for-4 with two runs and five RBIs. He hit two home runs again the next night against the Brewers, going 3-for-5 with 3 RBIs. The home runs came against Milwaukee starter Randy Wolf and reliever Kameron Loe. After the game, Álvarez had raised his batting average over 60 points, from .197 to .259, in just 11 days. \"Obviously, those first few weeks, it's a million miles an hour, and as time goes on you get used to it a little bit more and more.\" said Álvarez of his early struggles. \"It's very fun to go out there and play some good baseball and come out winning. It makes it that much better when you have a good day that you can celebrate with your teammates.\"\nOn August 7, 2010 Pedro hit a walk-off 3 run home run against the Colorado Rockies closer Huston Street.\nÁlvarez was named National League Player of the Week for September 20–26 for his performances. He finished the week 10-for-24 (.417) with 2 home runs and 13 RBIs. Álvarez continued his hot streak, going 4-for-5 with 5 RBIs on September 30 against the Florida Marlins while raising his season batting average 8 points from .249 to .257. Álvarez finished the season by winning the NL Rookie of the Month Award for September, hitting .311 and leading all Major League rookies with 26 RBIs in his final 27 games.\n2011.\nÁlvarez compiled a .208 batting average and a .587 OPS in 36 games. On May 21, 2011 Álvarez was placed on the 15-day disabled list. After being reinstated from the DL on July 9, 2011 he was optioned to the AAA Indianapolis Indians. For the season, with the Pirates he batted .191/.272/.289 in 235 at bats.\n2012.\nÁlvarez decided not to spend the 2011–12 offseason playing winter league ball. After the first nine games of the 2012 season, he struck out 13 times in his first 27 at-bats. In an interleague series against the Cleveland Indians, Álvarez hit two home runs in back-to-back games on June 16 and 17, making him only the second Pirates' player with multi-home run games in back-to-back games since 1918, with Ralph Kiner being the other player. Álvarez hit a go-ahead home run in the 19th inning against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 19, the longest game in the majors to that point in the season and tied for the longest in terms of time at 6 hours, 7 minutes. Álvarez hit a 469-ft home run, the longest hit by a Pittsburgh Pirate in the history of PNC Park at the time, in a two-homer game against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 28. For the season, he batted .244/.317/.467, was second in the National League with 180 strikeouts, and led all NL players with 27 errors at third base.\n2013.\nÁlvarez was selected to the National League All-Star team in 2013. He also participated in the Home Run Derby, where he hit six home runs. On September 13, he hit an inside-the-park home run. He finished the 2013 season with 36 home runs, tied with Paul Goldschmidt for most in the National League and third-most in the majors, and 100 RBI, which was tied for fifth-most in the NL. On October 9, 2013, he became the first player in baseball history to record an RBI in each of his first 6 postseason games. In Game 3 of the NLDS vs. the St. Louis Cardinals, Álvarez had the game-winning RBI in the 8th inning that gave the Pirates a 2–1 series lead. For the season, he batted .233/.296/.473, led the National League in strikeouts with 186, and led all NL third basemen with 27 errors. He also won the National League Silver Slugger Award for third basemen.\n2014.\nÁlvarez committed an MLB-leading 24 errors by August 3. As a result, Álvarez was removed from the everyday lineup and utility player Josh Harrison received the starting job at third base for an indefinite time period. This led to the Pirates' considering a move for Álvarez from third base to first base in order to keep his offensive capabilities in the lineup. On August 18, Álvarez made his first Major League appearance at first base against the Atlanta Braves at PNC Park.\nThe Pirates announced on September 10 that Alvarez had been diagnosed with a stress fracture in his left foot stemming from an injury he sustained in-game on August 26. He missed the remainder of the regular season, and was left off of the Wild Card Game roster against the San Francisco Giants. For the season, he batted .231/.312/.405, and for the third season in a row led all NL players in errors, with 25 at third base.\n2015.\nIn the 2015 season, Álvarez transitioned to first base full-time. Álvarez played 150 games in 2015, hitting .243/.318/.469 with 27 home runs and 77 RBIs. However, he also made 23 errors in 124 games at first base, leading the National League, including a major-league-leading 19 fielding errors.\nOn December 2, 2015, Álvarez was non-tendered by the Pirates, making him a free agent for the first time in his career.\nBaltimore Orioles (2016–2018).\nOn March 10, 2016, the Baltimore Orioles signed Álvarez to a one-year, $5.75 million deal, which also included performance bonuses between $1.25 million and $1.5 million.\nÁlvarez was hitless in his first 12 at-bat and batted .182 over his first 15 games. His struggles continued, as he hit just .194 through the end of May while playing in 34 games. In June, Álvarez raised his average up to .230. At the All-Star break, he slashed .249/.320/.462 while hitting nine homers and driving in 26 runs. On September 2 he hit his 20th home run of the season, becoming the sixth Oriole to hit 20+ homers on the year. It was his second career home run to land on Eutaw Street. For the season, he batted .249/.322/.504.\nIn 2017, Álvarez only had 32 at-bats with the Orioles, and made four errors in nine chances at third base. With their AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides, he batted .239/.294/.442.\nOn February 25, 2018, Álvarez re-signed with the Orioles on a minor league contract. He had his contract purchased on March 29. On June 19, he was designated for assignment; at the time, his slash line was .180/.283/.414. Alvarez declared free agency on October 9, 2018.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 3, 2018, Álvarez signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins. He was released on March 25, 2019, after opting out of his contract.\nPost-playing career.\nOn February 4, 2022, Álvarez was hired by the Milwaukee Brewers as an assistant to the baseball operations team.\nPersonal life.\nÁlvarez has been married to his wife, Keli, since 2011. Keli is the daughter of Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy.\nÁlvarez earned his bachelor's degree in medicine, health and society from Vanderbilt in 2022.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "text": "Richard Bryan (born 21 January 1977 in Bristol, Gloucestershire) is a former rugby union footballer for Leeds Carnegie (later Yorkshire Carnegie). He has also served as Player Development Manager and other roles in the Rugby Players Association (RPA).\nHis usual position was at the back row . The Tykes signed Bryan from Newport Gwent Dragons in May 2006. He made his Tykes début against Nottingham R.F.C. on 1 October 2006 at Meadow Lane as a replacement in a 37-30 victory. \"I am very pleased to be joining Leeds after a difficult few months in Wales,\" said Bryan on joining the club, \"This will give me a chance to restart my career and the club share a lot of my ambitions. Next year will be a fresh start for the Tykes, with the amount of new players signing for the club and young players being promoted, and that is great for me. You cannot be anything other than very impressed by the set up here at the Tykes. The calibre of player we are signing bodes well for next season and trying to get back into the Premiership. I realise I will be one of the more experienced players in the squad but I am looking forward to that challenge, at my last couple of clubs that leadership role is something I have enjoyed.\"\nBryan began his career with Bath Rugby before moving on to skipper Bridgend. At the Brewery Field he led the club to the last Welsh Premiership title before the introduction of regional rugby with 13 league wins in 14 games. He also played five times in the Heineken Cup .\nWith the introduction of regional teams he was drafted into the Celtic Warriors side along with former Tyke Richard Parks . He moved to Newport following the demise of the Warriors in 2004 and made 23 appearances in the Celtic League in two seasons. Bryan took over the captaincy duties from Jason Forster .\nIn 2004 Bryan wondered whether he had any future in the game after clutching his knee in agony on the Rodney Parade pitch after falling awkwardly near the end of a game against Edinburgh .\nA cruciate ligament had gone in the knee and a complete reconstruction was required with no certainty about the outcome. Ironically, it was fellow Tyke Rhys Oakley who replaced him in the Dragons' side.\nBut he recovered and he made a full return to the Newport side. Bryan said at the time: \"The injury didn't even come through contact. I just sidestepped at the end of the game, right in the 80th minute, and it just went. I had never felt anything like it, I was in a huge amount of pain and felt pretty desperate.\n\"When I first did it I didn't realise how long it would be, maybe three or four months, so it was really hard. It was the longest I'd been out injured and it was a struggle watching all the boys playing, it was a case of trying to make the best of a bad job.\n\"But everyone at the club (Newport) was really good which helped me get through it, and I knew there were other players like Ben Breeze , Kevin Morgan and Peter Sidoli who had recovered from the same type of injury.\""

        "text": "Eric Steven King (born April 10, 1964) is a former pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He may be best known for giving up Ken Griffey Jr.'s first career Major League home run. King played for three teams during a career that included parts of seven seasons. Those teams are the Detroit Tigers (1986–1988 and 1992), Chicago White Sox (1989–1990) and Cleveland Indians (1991).\nMinor league.\nKing attended Moorpark College near Los Angeles, intending to play baseball in 1983, but his attitude butted heads with the coach, and he was dismissed from the team. He left Moorpark and played two seasons in the minor leagues for the San Francisco Giants before being traded to the Detroit Tigers.\nCareer.\nOn May 15, 1986, King played in his first MLB game. He pitched scoreless innings of relief against the Texas Rangers, posting three walks and three strikeouts, while surrendering only one hit as the Tigers lost by an 8–1 score. For the season, King appeared in 33 games and innings. He started 16, but he also finished 9, recording three saves and three complete games, including one shutout. He tallied an 11–4 record and a 3.51 ERA while striking out 79 opponents and walking 63. He was honored that season as the Tigers Rookie of the Year.\nKing was back with the Tigers in 1987 and he pitched in a career–high 55 games, making only four starts. He saved nine games and finished a total of 26. King's win–loss record was 6–9 and his ERA jumped by a whole run to 4.89. His strikeout total climbed slightly to 89 and he walked 60 in 116 innings.\nIn 1988, King appeared in only 23 games for Detroit. He won four times and suffered one loss. King threw innings, the lowest for any season during his MLB career. His ERA improved to 3.41 and with the lower number of innings pitched, his walk and strikeout totals were almost cut in half, as King fanned 45 batters and walked 34. He started five games and saved three.\nPrior to the 1989 season, King was acquired by the Chicago White Sox, who sent Kenny Williams to Detroit in exchange. Chicago used King solely as a starter and in 25 starts, King posted a 9–10 record and a 3.39 ERA. He hurled innings, striking out 72, but walking 64. King also threw a complete-game shutout against the Seattle Mariners on April 22, winning 1–0.\nKing's second and final season with the White Sox was 1990. He had a 12–4 win–loss record and posted a career–low ERA of 3.28, as he made 25 starts for the second consecutive year. In 151 innings, King's walk total dropped to 40 and he struck 70 opponents. He also hurled a pair of shutouts; against the Kansas City Royals on May 5 and against the Oakland Athletics on June 22. On December 4, 1990, Chicago sent King along with Shawn Hillegas to the Cleveland Indians. The White Sox received Cory Snyder and Lindsay Foster (who never made it to the MLB) in the deal.\nIn 1991, King played for his third major league team, as he appeared in 25 games for Cleveland, all but one as a starter. His 6–11 record left him with the lowest winning percentage (.353) of his MLB career. King's ERA, which had not been over 3.41 since his second season, jumped all the way to 4.60. Despite this, he threw two complete games and one shutout. King struck out 59 and walked 44 in innings.\nKing returned to the Tigers for what would prove to be his final major league season in 1992. In 17 games (14 starts), he was 4–6 with 45 strikeouts, 28 walks, one save and a career-worst 5.22 ERA over innings.\nKing went several years without pitching due to arm injuries before attempting a comeback in independent baseball in 1998."

He was traded to the Kitchener Rangers of the OHL on October 6, 2002 for future considerations. Clarkson spent three seasons with the Rangers, during which he won the Memorial Cup in 2003.\nProfessional career.\nFollowing his junior ice hockey career, Clarkson went undrafted and was signed as a free agent by the New Jersey Devils on August 12, 2005. He was assigned to the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League (AHL) in September for the 2005–06 AHL season. He would go on to play the majority of the 2006–07 AHL season with the Devils' new minor league team, the Lowell Devils (also of the AHL), before receiving a late-season call-up to New Jersey.\nClarkson made his NHL debut on March 15, 2007, on the road against the Carolina Hurricanes. He scored his first NHL goal on John Grahame one game later in a 7–2 loss to Carolina at home. He played in 81 games in the 2007–08 season with the Devils, registering 9 goals and 22 points. Clarkson was top on his team in penalty minutes (183) during the season. Clarkson played in the YoungStars Game during the 56th NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition, scoring one goal and two assists. He was the lone Devils' representative at the festivities, as Martin Brodeur (who had been voted in to the All-Star Team) was unable to participate. On July 1, as a restricted free agent, Clarkson was re-signed by the Devils for two years at $800,000 per year. Clarkson played in all 82 games during the 2008–09 season, scoring 17 goals. The following season, Clarkson played in only 46 games, missing a large part of the year with a broken leg. He scored 11 goals and 24 points. In the off-season he re-signed with the Devils to a three-year deal.\nClarkson broke out in the 2011–12 season under head coach Peter DeBoer who had coached him in Kitchener. He scored a career-high 30 goals and 48 points and the Devils went on to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Devils would lose in the finals to the Kings. As the 2012–13 NHL lockout began, Clarkson signed with Austrian team EC Red Bull Salzburg to begin the 2012–13 season. Once the NHL lock-out was settled, he returned to the Devils and did well offensively, scoring 15 goals though New Jersey failed to the make the playoffs.\nAn unrestricted free agent, Clarkson did not re-sign with the Devils during the off-season, instead signing a seven-year, $36.75 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs on July 5, 2013. On September 22, 2013, a brawl erupted during a pre-season game against the Buffalo Sabres during which Clarkson left the bench to fight. He subsequently received an automatic ten-game suspension from the NHL. There were high expectations in Toronto that Clarkson would score 20 to 30 goals based on his contract. Clarkson made his debut with the Maple Leafs on October 26, 2013 in a 5–2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. He scored his first goal with Toronto against the New York Islanders's goalie Kevin Poulin on November 20. Clarkson was suspended for a second time that season, sitting out two games after hitting Vladimir Sobotka of the St. Louis Blues in the head. He ended his first season in Toronto with 5 goals and 11 points in 60 games. During the 2014–15 pre-season, Clarkson fought Cody McCormick and suffered a facial injury that required visiting a specialist. In the midst of his second season with the Maple Leafs, unable to establish a level of play to match his contract and plagued by injuries, Clarkson was traded by Toronto to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Nathan Horton on February 26, 2015. In total, Clarkson played 118 games with the Leafs over two years, scoring 15 goals and 26 points. \nHealthy scratches and injuries would hold Clarkson to only 26 games with the Blue Jackets over the next year and a half, registering only 4 points. As training camp for the 2016–17 season approached, it was announced that Clarkson had failed a physical and would not be invited to practice with the Blue Jackets. He was placed on the long-term injured reserve due to serious back injuries. Clarkson never played again in the NHL due to an injury suffered in March 2016 with the Blue Jackets. On June 21, 2017, Clarkson's contract, along with first-round and second-round draft picks were obtained by the Vegas Golden Knights at the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft in a pre-arranged trade with the Blue Jackets in order for the Golden Knights to select William Karlsson. The Blue Jackets needed space under the salary cap and needed to protect other prospects in the expansion draft. On July 23, 2019, Clarkson, along with a 2020 fourth-round pick, was traded back to the Maple Leafs in exchange for goaltender Garret Sparks. He was placed on injured reserve to clear up cap space for the Leafs.\nPersonal life.\nClarkson was born in Etobicoke, Ontario, growing up in the Mimico neighbourhood. He and his wife Brittney have five children three daughters and two sons. The family resides in Castle Pines, Colorado. Clarkson volunteered in 2017 as an assistant coach for the Upper Arlington High School hockey team, in Upper Arlington, Ohio, before taking on the head coaching job the following year."

        "title": "Ninja Golf",
        "text": "Ninja Golf is a beat 'em up/golf video game developed by BlueSky Software and published by Atari Corporation for the Atari 7800. Gameplay consists of the ninja player character hitting a golf ball at the beginning of each hole (stage) then fighting various enemies in side-scrolling sections to reach it. Each green is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon boss that the player must defeat by throwing \"shurikens\".\nThe game's design team consisted of programmers David A. Dentt and David R. Sullivan. A version for the Atari 8-bit family was in simultaneous production but was cancelled. The game's 1990 release was one of the Atari 7800's last before the console's discontinuation.\nCritical reception for \"Ninja Golf\" has been mixed, though retrospective media coverage has seen its unusual concept and blend of genres as very memorable. The game has since been featured on several retro game compilations, services, and consoles. An enhanced remake for iOS and Android was developed by Alpha Dog Games and released by Atari Interactive in 2019.\nGameplay.\n\"Ninja Golf\" mixes golf and beat 'em up gameplay and puts the player in the role of a ninja who has completed their training, tasked with nine holes of the titular sport as a final test. Each hole (stage) begins with the player aiming their golf ball via a mini-map and shooting it toward the green. The path to reach the ball is set up like a traditional side-scroller, where the player fights other ninjas and hostile animals along the way. These creatures include gophers, birds, giant frogs, sharks, and snakes, depending on the environment. For instance, sharks are encountered in water hazards and snakes in sand traps. Ninjas exist in all the environments, including underwater.\nThe player can dodge foes by jumping and crouching as well attack with punches, kicks, and a limited supply of throwing shurikens. All regular enemies die in a single hit. The player can pick up restorative items such as extra health, lives, and shurikens as well as temporary invincibility and an instant warp to the green. The pattern of taking golf swings and fighting towards the ball's landing spot repeats until the green is reached, where the player encounters a dragon boss that guards it. These battles take place in a third-person perspective. The player must hit the dragon with shurikens while moving either right or left to avoid its fireballs. The player's score increases with defeating enemies, picking up items, and finishes holes with a limited number of strokes. The game contains four difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard, and \"kamikaze\".\nDevelopment.\n\"Ninja Golf\" was developed by BlueSky Software with a team consisting of programmers David R. Sullivan and David A. Dentt alongside artist Dana Christian. Sullivan was contracted by BlueSky while Dentt was led to employment at the company in 1988 while working at the arcade game developer Cinematronics. \"Ninja Golf\" was one of several titles pitched by publisher Atari Corporation's internal software team in early 1989.\nSullivan claimed that BlueSky was originally set to create a comedic platformer in the spirit of the film \"Caddyshack\", but the simultaneous popularity of ninjas in the 1980s and the success of golf games like \"Mean 18\" led to the finalized concept. \"The way it was explained to me was that sports games were popular, ninjas were popular, so \"Ninja Golf\"\", Dentt recounted. \"One can not help but be in awe of the thought process!\" After being given the concept, the team expanded on it as development progressed, frequently receiving feedback from Atari. According to Sullivan, Christian was responsible for the game's more absurd elements and Atari was unhappy that the game swayed from a more serious tone.\nThe budget for the project was $77,000 USD. The programmers each worked on a separate port of the game: Dentt on a version for the Atari 7800 home console and Sullivan on a version for the Atari 8-bit family of personal computers (including the Atari 400, 800, and XE). The two frequently shared code with one another at their weekly meetings at a Sizzler restaurant. Aside from some art, the builds were nearly identical. However, the 8-bit family version was eventually cancelled and remaining work shifted solely to the 7800 release.\nDentt's equipment consisted of an Atari ST and one external hard disk drive. The team had planned to implement a 3D renderer for the golf gameplay, but a simpler side-view was quickly added instead as combat became the main focus. When coding the graphics, Dentt recalled that the 7800 split the screen into three distinct sections. Each section could swap its palette during interrupt, increasing the possible total of colors on-screen at once. Dentt hid a joystick test within the game even after his producer insisted it be removed.\nRelease.\n\"Ninja Golf\" was one of a plethora of games first unveiled by Atari at the summer 1989 Consumer Electronics Show. This came alongside an announcement that the company intended to further support its consoles even as its market share continued to dwindle against overwhelming competition from Nintendo. \"Ninja Golf\" was released in North America in the fourth quarter of 1990 and was one of the last titles for the Atari 7800. Atari manufactured about 100,000 cartridges for retail. The game has since seen numerous re-releases. It was included on the Internet Archive's MESS emulator in 2014; as part of a collection of Atari games for the Evercade handheld in 2020; on the short-lived Plex Arcade streaming service in 2021; on the \"Atari 50\" compilation for eighth and ninth generation consoles in 2022; and on cartridge for the Atari 2600+ console in 2024.\nAn enhanced remake of \"Ninja Golf\" was developed by Alpha Dog Games and published by Atari Interactive as a Free-to-play application for iOS and Android around March 2019. Like the original game, the remake switches between golf and beat 'em up gameplay, but now features fully 3D graphics. In 2021, Atari sold off the distribution rights to the \"Ninja Golf\" remake alongside other free-to-play apps in order to refocus on marketing premium games for console and PC.\nReception and legacy.\nCritical reception for \"Ninja Golf\" has been mixed, though retrospective media sources have considered the game very memorable due to its unusual premise and mix of genres. Robert Naytor of \"Hardcore Gaming 101\" felt that neither the golf nor the beat 'em up gameplay were particularly well-realized, leading to a difficult and repetitive experience once the charm of the concept wears off. \"AllGame\" reviewer Joseph Scoleri III gave a similar assessment, summarized, \"While these facets of the game are imaginative, amusing and fun, the overall gameplay seems a little bland in comparison.\" John Delaney of the \"Retro Gamer\" team noted the serious delivery of its humor as deadpan and its gameplay as fun despite being simplistic compared to other beat 'em ups and golf simulations.\n\"Wireframe\" contributor Ian Dransfield summarized it as having \"sort of \"Jack Nicklaus\"-does-\"Shinobi\" vibes. Is it good? No, not really. Is it absurd and funny? Yep. Perfect for golf haters everywhere.\" Brett Weiss wrote in his book \"Classic Home Video Games 1972-1984\" that the game successfully combines distinct genres, lauding the boss encounters as graphically impressive and functionally reminiscent of the bonus stages from the original \"Shinobi\". Atari Gaming Headquarters reviewer Matthew Lippart made a similar observation regarding the boss fights and offered general praise to its graphics. He commended the combat gameplay while noting its difficulty in attacking when jumping and summarizing it \"basically \"Kung Fu\" with a really bad golf engine thrown in.\" Andy Slaven briefly mentioned in \"Video Game Bible, 1985-2002\" that the game's premise \"may sound wacky\" but it is \"surprisingly enjoyable\".\nOn his list \"The Best and Worst of '80s Ninja Video Games\" \"Den of Geek\" writer Craig Lines proclaimed, \"I’m not sure there’s a more quintessentially '80s game in existence than Ninja Golf,\" calling it \"endlessly inventive\" and \"one of the best of its kind.\" Levi Buchanan of \"IGN\" listed it as the second best release on the Atari 7800, stating in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, \"\"Ninja Golf\" is a better conversation piece than a game. But how can you deny the concept? Or that box art?\"\nThe game has been featured on other lists by magazines and websites in the decades following its original release. This includes \"Next Generation\"’s \"five most bizarre game concepts of all time\", CNET's \"30 dumbest videogame titles ever\", \"Paste\"’s \"10 Goofy Golf Videogames that Aren’t \"Mario Golf\", \"Bleacher Report\"’s \"12 Most Insane Sports Video Games Ever\", and \"Complex\"’s \"15 Most Violent Sports Video Games\". The game's cover art has been considered among the worst of all time by \"IGN\", \"Complex\", \"ComicsAlliance\", \"Comic Book Resources\", \"T3\", \"Sports Illustrated\", and \"Grunge\"."

He was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons, playing for the Los Angeles Rams, the Denver Broncos, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Kansas City Chiefs. Michael Young’s career in professional sports has spanned over 33 years as he is one of the very few NFL players to occupy senior level executive positions for multiple professional sports franchises.\nCollege.\nThe Visalia, California native was a multi-sport athlete at Mt. Whitney High School, where he excelled in football and baseball. Michael’s career statistics of 162 catches for 3,005 yards and 44 touchdowns still stand as one of the top performances in CIF history. Young was recruited by every major college football program in the country, accepting recruiting visits to Notre Dame, USC, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Washington and UCLA. \nAt UCLA, he played both football and baseball. Young helped the Bruins to two Pac-10 titles, two Rose Bowl (1983, 1984) victories and a Fiesta Bowl (1985) win. Michael was an Academic All-Pac 10 selection in 1984 and, in the 1984 Rose Bowl game, Young had five receptions for a total of 127 yards, including a 52-yard touchdown pass from Rick Neuheisel. As a two-sport athlete, Young was drafted by the New York Mets in 1983 after hitting .311 his sophomore year. Following the 1985 Fiesta Bowl win, in which he was the leading receiver, he was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams. He earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from UCLA.\nProfessional career.\nYoung was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the sixth round (161st overall) of the 1985 NFL Draft. In 10 years in the NFL, he played in 114 games, amassing 144 receptions, 2,034 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nYoung played in Super Bowl XXIV in 1989, where his Denver Broncos lost to the San Francisco 49ers. In that playoff run, he had 4 receptions for 145 yards and a touchdown, which remains the Broncos' franchise record of yards per reception for a single postseason, at 36.3.\nPost-NFL career.\nYoung successfully made the transition to the Broncos’ front office after a 10-year career as a wide receiver in the National Football League. In 13 years in the front office of the Denver Broncos, he was responsible for the development and management of corporate partnerships, marketing, and branding. Initially hired by Broncos owner Pat Bowlen to develop and implement a corporate partnerships program, Young was instrumental in creating the platform and eventual sale of the stadium naming rights of INVESCO Field at Mile High Stadium. During his tenure, Young oversaw several major rebranding efforts including a collaborative effort with Phil Knight of Nike to redesign the Broncos team logos and uniforms, which propelled the Broncos from 20th to one of the top three teams in NFL merchandise sales. Young was also responsible for the creation and design of the Broncos’ first and only mascot, Miles.\nIn 2003, while serving as the Broncos’ Senior Director of Special Projects, Young, along with the backing of Bowlen, John Elway and Denver sports mogul Stan Kroenke, launched the Colorado Crush of the Arena Football League. In his role as Executive Vice President, Young designed and implemented the Crush's entire business strategy. In the first two years of its existence, the Crush sold out every game to lead the Arena Football League in attendance and, in its third year of existence, won the Arena Football League Championship.\nOn May 22, 2009, Young was appointed as Chief Revenue Officer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. As the first and only Chief Revenue Officer of the franchise, he oversaw all major revenue streams, which included ticket sales, corporate sales, premium seating and all media partnerships. Throughout Young’s career, he has been personally responsible for the development of corporate partnership transactions which have generated over $350,000,000. Young has created and led departments that have transacted with virtually every major corporation connected to sports and entertainment resulting in over a billion dollars in total revenues."

        "text": "The 2007 British Grand Prix (formally the 2007 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was the ninth race of the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship. It was held on 8 July 2007 at the Silverstone Circuit. The race was won by Kimi Räikkönen after overtaking pole position driver Lewis Hamilton during the first round of pit stops. Second place was taken by Fernando Alonso and Hamilton was third. With his ninth straight podium, Hamilton set the record for most consecutive podium finishes in a debut season.\nFollowing British driver Lewis Hamilton's win at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, circuit director Richard Phillips reported that ticket sales had \"gone through the roof\". Phillips added, \"we haven't seen this level of interest since Mansell-mania in the late 80s and early 90s\".\nReport.\nBackground.\nIn the run up to the race Ferrari presented a legal case against English engineer Nigel Stepney and a McLaren employee, after a search warrant revealed evidence of theft of technical information from the Italian team. McLaren indicated that they would fully cooperate with the investigation, and after a thorough internal investigation the team concluded that \"no Ferrari intellectual property has been passed to any other members of the team or incorporated into its cars.\" The FIA are launching their own investigation into the matter, but stress that their investigation will only involve matters of the Formula One rules and regulations.\nIn another element of the pre-race activities, the Red Bull cars of David Coulthard and Mark Webber sported a livery of fan-submitted images as part of a one-off event for the charity \"Wings for Life\". More than 30,000 fans pledged money and uploaded images to the team's website, and each fan has selected a spot on either car to have their image placed. The goal was to raise €1 million. This would be repeated again at the 2012 British Grand Prix, but the number would be reduced to 25,000 fans.\nPreparations for the race began on 19 June, when the teams began testing at Silverstone. During the first day's testing Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time, focusing on his race setup for the Grand Prix. In contrast the two top constructors, McLaren and Ferrari, set about testing new parts and developments on their cars. This testing was undertaken by their respective test drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and Luca Badoer. Spyker brought a new chassis to the test and raced it for the first time, with Adrián Vallés and Giedo van der Garde taking the car around the track for 64 laps. Nick Heidfeld ended his test session early after complaining of back problems.\nIn day two of testing it was Jarno Trulli's turn to take the Toyota car around Silverstone, and managed to set the fastest time before the session was slowed down by showers. While Ferrari continued to test new parts to their car, this time with Kimi Räikkönen taking to the seat, McLaren stuck with Pedro de la Rosa and worked on the race set up and aerodynamics.\nDay three saw Toyota drop down from taking the fastest times to take the fifth fastest time on a moderately damp track. Felipe Massa was the fastest man on the track after 87 laps of the British circuit testing various aerodynamic and mechanical adjustments to the car. Although delayed through an oil system problem Alonso finished off aerodynamics work and continued to set up the car for the coming British Grand Prix, finishing with a time slower than second placed Williams driver Nico Rosberg. The leading GP2 driver Timo Glock took to the circuit with BMW Sauber up against ex-rival Nelson Piquet Jr. who was driving with Renault. Piquet Jr. made the fourth fastest time, more than a second faster than Glock.\nPractice.\nThe first Friday practice was dominated as per many of the previous Grand Prix of the season, with Ferrari and McLaren taking the top 4 times. Lewis Hamilton took the top time at his home Grand Prix, and the two Ferraris split Alonso from his teammate. Both McLaren drivers spun their cars at different parts of the test, and they were not the only to do so. Other such drivers included Robert Kubica, David Coulthard, Adrian Sutil, Trulli and Massa; who all spun their vehicles on the greasy, but dry track. In the end Rosberg managed to set a faster time than the two competitive BMWs, and Trulli - who boasted a fastest time at Silverstone during testing in the last month - only just managed to set a faster time than Anthony Davidson in the Super Aguri. Davidson outpaced his British counterpart Jenson Button in the works Honda by half a second. Button, who suffered a minor back injury in a shunt in the United States Grand Prix, decided not to partake in the second Friday practice session in order to avoid aggravating the injury.\nToyota returned to previous testing form in the second session, putting their drivers in with the McLaren drivers, both of them outpacing Alonso. Schumacher even managed to run exactly the same time as Hamilton. Ferrari meanwhile got the two fastest times of the session, with Räikkönen a full half a second faster than his Brazilian team-mate. Williams were close up behind Alonso, as BMW were running lower in the field than usual. Although Kubica was not complaining, Nick Heidfeld said that \"[the car] was difficult to drive, so we have to figure out why.\" Christian Klien got a drive during the practice to replace Button in the car and help set it up. Both of the works Hondas were beaten by both of the Super Aguri cars and Davidson improved on his time and position to tenth. Drivers from many different teams were running off the Copse corner, with eight drivers running off eleven times. The only incident of the afternoon was at the Copse, where Adrian Sutil ran his car onto the tarmac, then spun into the tyre barrier. He was unharmed and the damage to the car was insignificant.\nOn the Saturday practice before the qualifying, the top drivers broke the 1 minute 20 barrier, with Massa, Alonso and Räikkönen all setting fastest laps in the high 1 minute 19s. Räikkönen took the fastest time, faster than rival Alonso who had set a very similar time to Massa. Hamilton's final time on low fuel was disrupted by Alexander Wurz sending his Williams off the track, resulting in a yellow flag. Toyota and Williams were the closest to the top of the pack - as BMW continued their bad run. Nick Heidfeld improved from his bad run from the day before to take a joint eighth fastest time, but team-mate Kubica found himself only able to achieve a sixteenth fastest time. Davidson out paced his team-mate for the third time of the weekend, and he achieved a tenth fastest time - something he has never converted to a qualifying session.\nQualifying.\nThe first qualifying session was disrupted near the end by Anthony Davidson, who spun his Super Aguri while attempting to warm the tyres, bringing out the yellow flags. This also meant that he could not complete a good hot lap and left him near the back of the grid. This also forced Sato and Button to slow down on their hot laps, and the three drivers could not improve on their previous times in the closing stages of the session. The six drivers eliminated in the first round were Albers, Sato, Sutil, Davidson, Button and Rosberg (for the first time this season, but due to an engine issue). The fastest time of the session was taking by Alonso.\nThe second session was quite uneventful, with Alonso taking the fastest time again. Near the end of the session the six fastest drivers decided not to set any more times. This was a gamble for the two BMW drivers, as by the end of the session Heidfeld had been pushed down to tenth position. The six drivers who were eliminated from the final session were Liuzzi, Speed, Barrichello, Wurz, Coulthard and Webber.\nThe two McLaren drivers were the first two drivers out on the track for the initial fuel burning phase, and initially, Alonso was the fastest on the track. After the first set of pit stops it looked like Alonso was going to take the pole. On the last set of laps, Alonso was on a faster time than he was before, but Räikkönen was on a faster. Both of them completed their laps and Räikkönen came out on top, despite an error coming out of the final corner. Hamilton who had been sitting in fourth did not look like he was very competitive during qualifying. In the last few seconds of the session he set the fastest lap and put himself on pole position, and he was the only one to break into the 1 minute 19 second margin.\nRace.\nFelipe Massa stalled on the grid, leading to a second formation lap and causing the Brazilian to start from the pit lane, joining Takuma Sato, who also started from the pits. Hamilton led from the start with Räikkönen closely following and Alonso a few seconds behind them. Hamilton led the race until lap sixteen, when he made his stop and rejoined in fifth; his car briefly lurched forward with the fuel hose attached when Hamilton reacted to the 'lollipop' board being turned over. Räikkönen stopped three laps later and came out of the pit in front of Hamilton to take the race lead. Another three laps later Alonso took a good pit stop and came out in front of both of the previous race leaders.\nAs Alonso was short-fuelled in the first set of pit stops in order to jump into the race lead, it meant that he had to stop quite early compared to his rival. McLaren's plan was to use the superior pace of a lighter car to build up a large gap between him and Räikkönen before the second set of pit stops, but the traffic played into Räikkönen's hands and when Alonso had to pit Räikkönen resumed the race lead. He was able to make his final stop and rejoined without losing first position.\nBehind the leaders, Massa was forcing his way through the pack to make up as many places as possible from the back, and finished in fifth behind a defensive Robert Kubica. Nick Heidfeld took sixth, while Heikki Kovalainen and Giancarlo Fisichella brought the two Renaults home in seventh and eighth. Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button were taking advantage of being quite far back by investing in a one stop strategy and they finished ninth and tenth respectively. Nico Rosberg had a good race taking back quite a few places from the start - with points a possibility, but after a bad first pit stop he had to fight back to gain twelfth. His team-mate, Wurz, finished one place behind him in thirteenth after having tried to overtake Scott Speed and putting the American out of the race with broken suspension.\nDavid Coulthard took a good eleventh position; his team-mate, Webber, retired due to a full hydraulics failure. Adrian Sutil retired after a large engine failure going towards the Stowe corner. Toyota suffered the worst problems as both of their cars went out of the race, Ralf Schumacher retiring with a wheel fixation problem, and his teammate, Trulli retiring with handling problems. Anthony Davidson, after a good weekend of practice and an unlucky qualifying session, had to retire his Super Aguri car when he felt vibrations from the underside of the car. Liuzzi retired his car with gearbox failure but was ultimately still classified in 16th place.\nRäikkönen continued from the second stint of pit stops to take the win a couple of seconds ahead of Alonso. It was Räikkönen's second straight win after being victorious at the French Grand Prix the week before. Alonso, finishing second, told the Spanish press that he was adamant that he would catch up with Hamilton in the drivers championship saying that, \"With normal races, sooner or later I will close the gap. I must always be one step higher than him on the podium.\" The British driver finished third to lose two points in the championship to the chasing Alonso, but also achieving his ninth podium out of nine race starts, equalling Jim Clark's record. Hamilton also set the record for the most consecutive points finishes from a debut race.\nFollowing the race Ferrari chief Luca di Montezemolo complained that although Räikkönen had now won more races than any other driver in 2007, he was not leading the championship. Di Montezemolo said: \"This is unsporting, it's wrong: F1 shouldn't be a sport for calculators, it should be for winners.\""

        "text": "A cricket team representing England toured Australia in the 1932–33 season. The tour was organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club and matches outside the Tests were played under the MCC name. The tour included five Test matches in Australia, and England won The Ashes by four games to one. The tour was highly controversial because of the bodyline bowling tactics used by the England team under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine. After the Australian tour was over, the MCC team moved on to play in New Zealand, where two further Test matches were played.\nThe MCC team.\nThe MCC team was captained by Douglas Jardine, with Bob Wyatt as vice-captain. Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet were joint managers.\nThe team members were:\nWalter Robins and Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji were invited to tour, but declined to do so, the latter because of ill-health.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nAn easy victory for England, with Bradman absent for Australia. McCabe provided Australia's only significant resistance with the bat; Larwood claimed ten match wickets. Pataudi's century on Test debut was to be his sole Test century, and he was dropped after the second Test due to his dissent against Bodyline tactics (when he refused to move to a leg-side fielding position, Jardine is said to have commented \"I see his highness is a conscientious objector\").\nSecond Test.\nOn his return, Bradman was bowled first ball in the first innings when expecting a bouncer; Fingleton was left to hold Australia's first innings together. Nonetheless, an unbeaten century for Bradman in the second innings, and ten wickets for O'Reilly, granted Australia their only victory of the Test series.\nThird Test.\nThe match best known for Bodyline, with Woodfull receiving a blow to the chest (although he stayed at the crease to make an obdurate 73 not out) and Oldfield a fractured skull from Larwood's hostile fast bowling (although Oldfield's injury actually came from a top-edge to a waist-high delivery, rather than a proper bouncer, and Larwood was not bowling to a leg-theory field at the time: Oldfield declared it to have been his own fault for a poor shot.) Larwood took seven wickets in the match, but the principal wicket-taker was Allen, who took four in either innings despite his notable dissent against Bodyline.\nFourth Test.\nA match best remembered for the heroism of Paynter, who despite spending much of the match in hospital with severe tonsillitis, scored 83 in the first innings, and won the match with a six in the second.\nFifth Test.\nFine performances from both sides' middle orders (with some aid from dropped catches) led to approximate parity after the first innings. Hammond (101) and Larwood (98) in particular batted excellently; Larwood, promoted to number four as a night-watchman, scored the then highest innings ever made in that role. Bradman and Woodfull shared a partnership of 115 in Australia's second innings before Verity induced a collapse, and Wyatt and Hammond experienced little difficulty in reaching a target of 164, with Hammond in particularly belligerent form.\nCeylon.\nThe English team had a stopover in Colombo \"en route\" to Australia and played a one-day single-innings match there against the Ceylon national team, which at that time did not have Test status.\nSee also.\nFor details of the tactics involved in Bodyline bowling, see the Bodyline article."

The University of Tennessee product pitched for the Fort Worth Cats of the Independent League after not reaching terms with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who selected him in the sandwich round (40th overall) of the 2005 First-Year Player Draft.\nSix of the first seven picks and nine of the first 12 selections were pitchers. In addition to the 18 hurlers, seven outfielders, three third basemen and two catchers made up the rest of the first round.\nThe first six picks were from the college ranks. University of North Carolina pitchers Andrew Miller (6th overall, Tigers) and Daniel Bard (28th, Red Sox) and University of Texas teammates Drew Stubbs (8th overall, Reds) and Kyle McCulloch (29th, White Sox) went in the first round.\nKyle Drabek, the son of longtime Major League pitcher Doug Drabek, was chosen by the Philadelphia Phillies with the 18th pick. He is currently a free agent.\nDetroit's Andrew Miller became the first player from the 2006 Draft to reach the Major Leagues. He debuted in relief during a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium on August 30. He would make eight relief appearances for the Tigers during their pennant-winning season. He currently pitches in the St. Louis Cardinals organization and has also played for the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians.\nTim Lincecum was the first 2006 draftee to be selected to an All-Star Game. Lincecum was selected in 2008, and joined shortly thereafter by Evan Longoria, who was selected via the Final Vote. Longoria was the only one to play in the game. Longoria would later be voted Rookie of the Year. Lincecum was also the first to win a Cy Young Award (2008 and 2009) in the National League. Clayton Kershaw, 7th in the draft, went on to win the 2011, 2013 and 2014 NL Cy Young Awards, the 2014 NL MVP Award and played in the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 All-Star Games.\nAndrew Bailey, 6th round pick by the Oakland Athletics, became the 2009 American League Rookie of the Year and participated in the 2009 All-Star Game in St. Louis and 2010 All-Star Game in Anaheim as part of the Athletics.

Chris Coghlan, a supplemental first round pick, was the 2009 National League Rookie of the Year as a member of the Miami Marlins. he is currently a free agent.\nRyan Kalish, an outfielder who planned to attend the University of Virginia, was picked in the 9th round by the Boston Red Sox. His salary of $600,000 had to be approved by the Commissioner's Office, as it was well over what others drafted in that round were to receive. He signed with the Red Sox and made his major league debut in 2010.\nMax Scherzer, 1st round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks and later traded to the Detroit Tigers, won the 2013 Cy Young Award.

        "title": "UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball",
        "text": "The UNLV Runnin' Rebels are the men's basketball team that represent the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the Mountain West Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA); it plays at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on campus. As of 2023, UNLV has the seventh-highest winning percentage (.687) in Division I history. UNLV is 33–19 all-time in the NCAA tournament with a 63.5 winning percentage. In July 2008, ESPNU named the program the eighth most prestigious collegiate basketball program in the nation since the 1984–85 season.\nHistory.\nThe glory years.\nIn 1977, just seven years after joining Division I, The Rebels made the Final Four with a squad today known as the \"Hardway Eight\". Ten years later, the team made the Final Four with one loss. In 1990, UNLV won the NCAA Championship by beating Duke by a record-setting margin of 103–73, becoming the first team and only team to score over 100 points in the championship game. Before becoming a basketball powerhouse in the late 1970s, UNLV was often referred to as \"Tumbleweed Tech\" due to its relative obscurity. Led by famed coach Jerry Tarkanian, the Runnin' Rebels were among the most exciting teams in the nation. They consistently led the nation in points scored, turnovers forced, and most importantly – wins. The Runnin' Rebels were well known for going on long runs that turned close games into blowouts. They were also known for up-tempo offense and stifling defense.\nTarkanian was suspected of violating numerous NCAA regulations and was forced out in 1992 by then–president Robert Maxson. In 1998 Tarkanian received a $2.5 million out of court settlement when he sued the NCAA for violations stemming from its investigation of UNLV. The last Rebel squad coached by Tarkanian won their tenth consecutive Big West Conference regular season title, but was barred from the NCAA Tournament due to probation. The Rebels had actually been barred from the 1991 tournament only months after winning the title, but a settlement with the NCAA allowed them to play in that tournament and miss the next one.\nNCAA executive director Walter Byers famously disliked Tarkanian, and said \"Tark’s black players play a fast city-lot basketball without much style. Grab ball and run like hell, not lots of passing to set up the shots.” Byers described U.N.L.V.’s style as “ghetto run-and-shoot basketball” with little concern for defense.\nOn November 26, 2005, for his achievements as coach of the Runnin' Rebels (he was 509–105 in 19 years as head coach), the basketball court at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center was renamed Jerry Tarkanian Court, despite the recruiting sanctions and controversies.\nThe lean years.\nThe years after Tarkanian's departure were tumultuous. UNLV hired away Villanova coach Rollie Massimino to replace Tarkanian, but after two seasons and a 15–13 record in 1993–94, he was let go. There was outrage when it was revealed that Massimino had been awarded a secret contract— a deal that ultimately led to Maxson's departure from UNLV.\nMassimino was replaced by well–respected Tarkanian assistant Tim Grgurich, but he lasted just 7 games in 1994 before resigning. Howie Landa and Cleveland Edwards finished the 1994–95 season, which ended with a 12–16 record—the school's first losing season in 34 years, and first since moving up to Division I. The team hired UMass assistant Bill Bayno for the 1995–96 season. With a still-depleted roster, Bayno's first year ended with a 10–16 record, the worst in school history.\nHowever, Bayno engineered a very quick return to respectability. He was an excellent recruiter, bringing in future NBA talent including Shawn Marion, Tyrone Nesby, and Keon Clark. The Rebels returned to the NCAA tournament in 1997, their first appearance in six years. Bayno was let go in 2000, after the NCAA found that UNLV had violated rules while recruiting Lamar Odom. Odom ultimately chose Rhode Island over UNLV.\nIt was in the wake of Bayno that UNLV began looking for a well-respected coach to act as an anchor for the program. The school intensely pursued former University of Kentucky and Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, who ultimately spurned the university before choosing to work at Louisville. Former Saint Louis University coach Charlie Spoonhour replaced Bayno for the 2001–02 season, compiling a 54–31 record before resigning in the middle of the 2004 season.\nLon Kruger era.\nThe anchor turned out to be Lon Kruger, who came to Las Vegas after an unsuccessful stint as the coach of the Atlanta Hawks, with successful college stints at Kansas State, Florida and Illinois. Kruger's stint at UNLV began with a mediocre 17–15 record in the 2004–05 season that including seven losses in conference play and a poor start to the 2005–06 season that ultimately finished a respectable 17–13 and a loss in the conference tournament semifinals. Despite being picked to come in sixth in the Mountain West, UNLV started the 2006–07 season 3–0 led by future NBA player Joel Anthony and Lon Kruger's son, Kevin Kruger. Despite losing their next game, UNLV responded by winning a significant road game at Nevada 58–49, ranked No. 20 in the nation at the time, marking the first time since 1991 that UNLV beat a ranked team on the road. After defeating Texas Tech in late December and upsetting a nationally ranked Air Force squad, UNLV received their first national ranking in 14 years. Winning the Mountain West Conference tournament over BYU sealed their bid to the NCAA tournament and UNLV received a No. 7 seed. After narrowly beating Georgia Tech, the Rebels shocked 2nd seeded Wisconsin, sending them to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in over 15 seasons. However, their magical season came to an end as the Runnin' Rebels ultimately lost to Oregon in the Sweet 16, 76–72. The team finished 14th in the polls with a 30–6 record.\nThe next season, 2007–08, despite being picked to finish in fifth Mountain West Conference, UNLV surprised critics by starting the year 12–3. They finished in second place in the conference, with 12–4 record behind BYU. UNLV defeated BYU again to win the 2008 Mountain West tournament. Star guard Wink Adams scored 23 points and was given the MVP title. They received a No. 8 seed in the NCAA Tournament and beat Kent State in the First Round. UNLV lost in the Second Round to Kansas. They finished that season 27–8.\nThe Rebels started the 2008–09 season 5–0, their best start since 1999. A 73–55 loss to the California Golden Bears and 67–65 loss to Cincinnati the next day marked the first time in over 3 years that the Rebels had lost consecutive games. On December 31, 2008, they beat No. 18 Louisville 56–55, on the road, which was the highest ranked opponent the Rebels have beaten on the road since they beat No. 12 New Mexico in 1991. They also started off the first half of their season 13–2, their best 15 game start since they went 15–0 1991. They fell out in the second half of the season, going 8–7 and finished the regular season with a 21–9 record and 5th in their conference, though they did manage to sweep the season series with BYU and upset Utah at home. They were denied a third consecutive Mountain West Conference tournament Championship when they lost to the rival San Diego State Aztecs 71–57, on March 12, 2009. The Rebels went on to become a No. 5 seed in the 2009 NIT, but suffered a loss against Kentucky in the first round.\nDespite losing three starters from the previous era's squad, the Rebels started off strong once again for their 2009–10 campaign with their second consecutive 5–0 start, the first time since 1989–90 and 1990–91 that they have done so. Their victory over No. 16 Louisville was their first home victory against a ranked opponent since 2007 and the highest ranked opponent the Rebels have beaten since defeating the Wisconsin Badgers (ranked 6th in the final AP Poll) in 2007. On November 30, 2009, the Rebels were ranked 24th in the AP Polls and 21st in the USA Today/ESPN Polls, making it the first time the team was ranked since 2007. However, UNLV soon dropped out of the AP Top 25 with losses to Kansas State and USC. In early February, however, UNLV upset a No. 14 and Jimmer Fredette–lead BYU team. As a result, UNLV returned to the national rankings, but after losing their next three, they soon dropped out, though they recovered at the end of the season, and finished 11–5 in MWC play. On March 6, 2010, they ended their 2009–10 campaign with 74–56 win over Wyoming at home. They finished the season 23–7, their best win–loss season since 2007. Despite losing in the finals of the Mountain West tournament the following weekend, UNLV did manage to defeat BYU for the fifth time in six matchups. On March 14, 2010, the Runnin' Rebels returned to the NCAA tournament after missing out in 2009. They finished the season with a 25–9 record, losing in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Northern Iowa 66–69, thanks to a 3–pointer with under 3 seconds to go by the Panthers.\nWith all 5 starters back from the 2009–10 season, UNLV entered the 2010–11 season with high expectations. Initially, the Rebels lived up to the hype, starting the year 10–0 and was ranked No. 19 in the polls. However, the team lost their next two games, including one at home and dropped out of the rankings. Although they later went on to upset No. 11 Kansas State in Kansas City, the team never really recovered and lost to BYU at home for the first time since 2005, Kruger's first year at the helm. Like the 2008–09 squad, the Rebels collapsed down the stretch, though the team rallied somewhat towards the very end of the season, losing to a top 10 San Diego State team in a very tight game and defeating two \"bubble\" teams on the road. After losing to the Aztecs in the conference tournament, the Runnin' Rebels earned their 18th overall NCAA tournament bid and fourth in five seasons, being picked as an 8 seed in the Southwest Regional. After falling to the 9th seeded Illinois Fighting Illini 62–73, their season ended with a record 24–9. On April 1, 2011, Lon Kruger announced that he would be leaving UNLV for the University of Oklahoma.\nDave Rice era.\nUNLV soon replaced Kruger with Dave Rice, a little–known assistant at rival BYU. Rice played for the Rebels when they won the 1990 national title, and promised to bring back the up–tempo offense that was a trademark of the team prior to Kruger's hiring. On November 26, 2011, the Rebels upset No. 1 North Carolina at the Orleans Arena in the Las Vegas Invitational, 90–80 to start their season 7–0. It was their third consecutive 7–0 start to a season and was also regarded as Rice's first marquee win as coach. This win placed the UNLV Runnin' Rebels well within the Top 25. Despite losing to Wichita State on the road a little over a week later, UNLV then avenged last years lost to Illinois, which was also ranked in the top 25, in convincing fashion. This victory once again placed UNLV in the rankings. Shortly before Christmas, UNLV faced California, which had been ranked in the Top 25 for much of the beginning of the season, winning 85–68. Thereafter, UNLV dropped 124 points in a lopsided win against an inferior Central Arkansas team.\nDespite falling to the SDSU Aztecs in their conference opener in a very close game, the Runnin' Rebels responded with soundly defeating New Mexico, the preseason Mountain West favorite, at home in front of a sold out crowd as well as blowing out an up–and–coming Colorado State club that easily beat that at UNLV the previous year. Despite narrowly winning road games against Air Force and Boise State, UNLV was ranked No. 11 in the country, which set up for an early February Top 15 showdown against San Diego State, which won 9 of the last 10 meetings. In front of a rejuvenated UNLV student section and a capacity crowd, UNLV played a near–perfect game, only to let up in the closing minutes, but key defensive stops in the final seconds allowed UNLV to come atop 65–63. However, the Rebels blew an 18-point lead in the following game against lowly TCU, and despite scoring 97 points, they lost in overtime. This set up numerous road losses down the stretch, but still finished a respectable 9–5 in conference play and 3rd seed in the tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to New Mexico. Granted a six seed in the 2012 NCAA tournament, the Runnin' Rebels were upset in the opening round to Colorado despite trimming a 21–second point deficit to 2 in a 68–64 loss.\nDespite the loss in the tournament and losing three starters, as well as two key reserves from the 2011–12 team, Dave Rice brought a highly touted recruiting class for the 2012–13 season. A total of four ESPN Top 100 players were signed as well as two transfers from key players on Big East schools, highlighted by forward Anthony Bennett. As a result, UNLV was ranked in the Top 20 to start the season for the first time in 22 years, but suffered an early season loss to Oregon over Thanksgiving weekend. However, UNLV rebounded from the loss, though the Rebels did lose a match to UNC. Road struggles from last year continued to follow them, even though the Rebels did beat the Aztecs on the road, Rice's squad was embarrassed by second–to–last place Fresno State on the road. Although they easily defeated a Top 15 New Mexico team, UNLV lost to a lowly Air Force team on the road 72–56, falling to 5–5 in MWC play. However, UNLV recovered the rest of the way, winning their next five, including a come from behind victory over rival SDSU.

The 84–81 triumph earned UNLV a spot in the Final Four at the Superdome in New Orleans. Banks shined in the semi-final matchup with Indiana, connecting on a tournament–record 10 3–pointers, but it was not enough as the Rebels fell to the eventual champions, 97–93.

        "text": "Edward Joseph Flanagan (February 23, 1944 – May 10, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a center in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Purdue Boilermakers, before playing in the NFL for the Detroit Lions from 1965 to 1974 and for the San Diego Chargers from 1975 to 1976. Flanagan was selected to four Pro Bowls. After his playing career, he was a football coach.\nEarly years.\nFlanagan was born on February 23, 1944, in San Bernardino, California. His family moved to Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he played football under coach Earl Strohm at Altoona High School. When inducted into the Blair County Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, Flanagan noted that he had not been a star player in high school and was not a starter until his senior year.\nCollege career.\nFlanagan played college football at Purdue University from 1962 to 1964. He grew from between his freshman and sophomore year. During his sophomore and junior years, he played center on offense and linebacker on defense. As a senior, he was the starting center for the 1964 Boilermakers team that featured Bob Griese at quarterback and compiled a 6–3 record and finished in third place in the Big Ten Conference. Flanagan was selected by the conference coaches for the United Press International as the second-team center on the 1964 All-Big Ten team. He also played in the Blue-Gray Game and the Senior Bowl after his senior year.\nProfessional playing career.\nFlanagan was selected by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round, 64th overall pick, of the 1965 NFL Draft. His initial contract with the Lions was for a $2,000 bonus and $12,000 a year. While playing for the Lions, Flanagan supplemented his income in the off-season selling steel to the automobile companies, selling real estate, and working for a beer distributorship owned by former Detroit Tigers star Vic Wertz.\nFlanagan took over as the Lions' starting center as a rookie in 1965 and held the position for the next ten years. From 1965 to 1974, he started 139 games for the Lions, including a streak of 129 consecutive games. He was selected to play in the Pro Bowl four times, in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1973. He was also selected as a second-team All-NFL player by the Newspaper Enterprise Association in 1969 and Pro Football Writers of America in 1970.\nFlanagan developed a rivalry with Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus, and recalled Butkus as his \"greatest challenge\". He was quoted in 1973 calling Butkus \"a wild man on defense . . . one of the most foul-mouthed guys in the league . . . he insults you, your mother, and the team.\" Flanagan also claimed that Butkus \"would spit down the back of his neck\".\nIn May 1975, Flanagan signed with the San Diego Chargers. At the time, he said he was \"happy to be back home in my native state\", but emphasized that he had been treated well by the Lions and was leaving under \"happy circumstances\". He was the Chargers' starting center in 1975 and 1976, starting in 25 of the 26 games he played.\nIn July 1977, Flanagan was traded by the Chargers to the Los Angeles Rams. However, he was released on waivers by the Rams in early September 1977 prior to the start of the regular season.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1984, Flanagan was hired as the offensive line coach for the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League. In 1985, he was hired as the line coach for the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. As of 2013, he was an assistant coach with the Cedar Rapids Titans of the Indoor Football League.\nPersonal life.\nFlanagan had four children; Edward, Meghan, Ryan and Dan. He was married to his wife Tina for 32 year's and had one child(Dan Flanagan). \nFlanagan was hospitalized in Altoona with heart problems on May 8, 2023, and died on May 10, aged 79."

He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 1969 to 1972 and was selected as a consensus first-team offensive tackle on the 1972 College Football All-America Team. He later played professionally as a tight end for the Bills from 1973 to 1978, catching 62 passes for 818 yards.\nEarly years.\nSeymour was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1950. He grew up in Berkley, Michigan, and attended Shrine Catholic High School in Royal Oak, Michigan. His older brother, Jim Seymour, also attended Shrine High School and went on to become a standout wide receiver at the University of Notre Dame. Both Seymour brothers were inducted into the Shrine High School Hall of Fame in 2009, along with their brother, John, who played running back at West Point. \nUniversity of Michigan.\nSeymour enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1968 and played for coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1969 to 1972. He played as a split end in 1969 and a tight end from 1970 to 1971. In his two seasons as a tight end, Seymour caught 19 passes for 257 yards and one touchdown.\nAt 6'5\", 250 lbs., he was converted to an offensive tackle in 1972. At the end of the 1972 season, Seymour was selected as a consensus first-team offensive tackle on the 1972 College Football All-America Team. He received first-team honors from the Newspaper Enterprise Association, the Football Writers Association of America, the American Football Coaches Association, the \"Sporting News\" and \"Time\" magazine.\nProfessional football.\nSeymour was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the first round (seventh overall pick) of the 1973 NFL draft. He was selected primarily as an offensive lineman to block for O. J. Simpson, but he was converted back to the tight end position. As a rookie, he started all 14 games as a tight end for the Bills and caught 10 passes for 114 yards. Seymour ultimately played five seasons for the Bills from 1973 to 1977, appearing in 69 games, 68 of them as the team's starting tight end. His best game as an NFL player came against the undefeated New England Patriots on October 20, 1974. In that game, Seymour caught three passes for 64 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Bills to an upset victory over the Patriots. In five seasons with the Bills, Seymour caught 62 passes for 818 yards.\nIn August 1978, the Bills traded Seymour to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for wide receiver Frank Lewis. However, Seymour failed to pass the Steelers' physical when they discovered that he had undergone surgery on his arches. Seymour was returned to the Bills, but he never played another NFL game.\nLater years.\nSeymour currently resides in Okemos, Michigan."

        "text": "The ICE Hockey League (International Central European Hockey League, ICEHL), known as the win2day ICE Hockey League for sponsorship reasons, is a Central European hockey league that also serves as the top-tier ice hockey league in Austria. It currently features additional teams from Hungary, Italy, and Slovenia. The league was known as the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga (EBEL) from 2003 until 2020 and as the bet-at-home ICE Hockey League during the 2021–22 season.\nUntil 2005–06, the league consisted solely of Austrian teams. Since then, the league has added teams from Slovenia (from 2006 to 2017 and from 2021 onwards), Hungary (starting 2007–08), Croatia (from 2009–10 through 2012–13, and again from 2017–18 through 2018–19), the Czech Republic (starting in 2011–12 through 2019–20 and again from 2021-22 onwards), Italy (starting in 2013–14), and Slovakia (starting in 2020–21 through the start of 2021–22).\nThe non-Austrian teams are competing for the \"League Champion\" title. Only Austrian teams in this league are additionally eligible for the \"Austrian Champion\" title. The league has had different sponsors, and the current naming rights have been held by win2day.at since 2022.\nTeams from the ICEHL participate in the IIHF's annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the ICEHL was ranked the No. 6 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top three teams to compete in the CHL.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe roots of the league go back to 1923 and various Championships, whose winner is officially recognized as the Austrian Champion. There was no Austrian competition between 1939 and 1945. During World War II, a number of Austrian teams competed in the German Ice Hockey Championship, which is why the EK Engelmann Wien and Vienna EV list German Championships in their history.\n1965–1990.\nThe Bundesliga, as it was called, was incepted for the 1965-66 season by EC KAC from Klagenfurt, IEV from Innsbruck, WEVg from Vienna, and KEC from Kitzbühel. EC KAC won the championship 8 times in the 1970s.\nWhen the Austrian national hockey team earned promotion into the Group B of the IIHF, it led to a boom in spectators. Three foreign players were allowed and first signs of financial hiccups came. SV Kapfenberg went bankrupt, and WAT Stadlau abstained from participating in the Bundesliga for financial reasons.\n1990–2003.\nA first step in internationalization was undertaken as the clubs, in addition to the national championship, participated in the Alpenliga. The Alpenliga was formed with clubs from Italy and Slovenia. After making Ralph Krueger their manager in 1991 VEU Feldkirch won five championships from 1994 to 1998. Rising budgets caused more and more clubs to abstain from participation. In 1997 SV Kapfenberg went bankrupt during the season, and the championship was down to only four clubs. In 2000 VEU Feldkirch went bankrupt. The league was named after its sponsor, Uniqua.\n2003–2020.\nIn 2003 Erste Bank became sponsor and the league was named Erste Bank Eishockey Liga. In 2013–14, Italy's Bolzano Foxes became the first non-Austrian team to win the EBEL title when they beat the Salzburg Red Bulls 3 games to 2 in their best-of-five final series. Such success is not unheard of for an Italian outfit, but previous similar results took place in the Alpenliga and the Cup of the European Leagues, standalone competitions whose postseason tournaments were distinct from the Austrian playoffs. One year after rejoining the league from the Kontinental Hockey League, KHL Medveščak Zagreb once again withdrew from the EBEL, this time citing the difficult economic situation of the club.\n2020–present.\nIn 2020, the league was renamed to ICE Hockey League. \"ICE\" refers to the league's locale – International Central European – and the surface of an ice hockey rink. At the same time, bet-at-home.com became the title sponsor of the league. From the 2021-22 season onwards the league will expand to 14 teams, with reigning champions Olimpija Ljubljana and Pustertal Wölfe joining from the Alps Hockey League and Orli Znojmo returning after a one-year absence. Austrian online betting platform and casino win2day.at became the league's title sponsor in 2022.\nPlayoffs.\nWith their victory in the finals of the 2013–14 season, HC Bolzano became the first non-Austrian team to claim the league title. Formerly the best non-Austrian team result was when HDD Olimpija Ljubljana managed to get into the finals in the 2007–08 season, losing the championship to EC Red Bull Salzburg.\nAustrian Champions.\n bold – seasons in which league had teams outside Austria\n [*] – seasons in which the Austrian Champion didn't win the ICEHL title"

He represented the United States national team and predominantly played at the prop position.\nYouth and college.\nMacDonald started playing rugby during his sophomore year of high school in 1997. He graduated from Miramonte High School in 1999 and followed in the footsteps of his brother, who was also a rugby player. In addition to rugby, MacDonald showcased his talents in wrestling and football, achieving a remarkable 3rd place finish in state wrestling during his senior year of high school.\nMacDonald went on to win four rugby National Championships with the University of California, Berkeley. During his time there, he received the honor of being named an All-American five times between 2000 and 2004. Following the 2004 national championship, he was recognized as the tournament MVP.\nProfessional career.\nMacDonald had a professional career in England from 2005 to 2012, initially playing for the Worcester Warriors from 2005 to 2006. He then joined Leeds Carnegie from 2007 to 2012. MacDonald played a pivotal role for Leeds during the 2006-07 season, contributing to their success in winning National League 1 and securing promotion to the Premiership. Remarkably, he scored 10 tries that season, which is quite impressive for a front row player. Following the 2007-08 Premiership season, MacDonald was honored with the title of Leeds' Player of the Season, and he was appointed captain for the 2008-09 season. In June 2011, MacDonald extended his contract with Leeds Carnegie for an additional two years.

At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, MacDonald broke two US records: he tallied his 63rd cap, surpassing Luke Gross as the United States' most-capped player, and made his 11th appearance in a Rugby World Cup match, breaking the record held by Alec Parker. MacDonald was named Man of the Match in the United States' win over Russia at the 2011 Rugby World Cup; MacDonald was key as the US scrum made Russia wilt under pressure and MacDonald was outstanding at the breakdown.\nCoaching career.\nMacDonald was signed on as an assistant coach of the California Golden Bears rugby team in 2011. Since his joining of the team as the forwards coach in the 2011–12 season, Cal Rugby has made seven 15's national championship appearances, including two victories in 2016 and 2017."

India won the series 2–1, and the Men of the Series were Sanjay Manjrekar of India and Kepler Wessels of South Africa.\nMatch details.\n1st ODI.\nThe first match was South Africa's first-ever ODI and their first cricket match of any sort against India. The attendance was reported to be over 90,000. \nThe match was reduced to 47 overs per side. India won the toss and chose to field. South Africa scored 177/8 in their 47 overs with notable contributions from Wessels (50) and Adrian Kuiper (43). In their reply, India started badly with Allan Donald grabbing the first 3 wickets to leave India at 20/3. Sachin Tendulkar (62) and debutant Pravin Amre (55) guided India close to victory and despite Donald dismissing both of them to complete a 5-wicket haul, the lower order finished the game for India to give them a 1–0 lead in the series.\n2nd ODI.\nThe second match of the series was reduced to 45 overs per side. South Africa won the toss and inserted India. Half-centuries from Kris Srikkanth (68), Navjot Sidhu (61) and Sanjay Manjrekar (52*) helped India to a total of 223/6.

        "title": "UCLA Bruins men's basketball",
        "text": "The UCLA Bruins men's basketball program represents the University of California, Los Angeles in the sport of men's basketball as a member of the Pac-12 Conference. Established in 1919, the program has won a record 11 NCAA titles. Coach John Wooden led the Bruins to 10 national titles in 12 seasons, from 1964 to 1975, including seven straight from 1967 to 1973. UCLA went undefeated a record four times (1964, 1967, 1972, and 1973). Coach Jim Harrick led the team to another NCAA title in 1995. Former coach Ben Howland led UCLA to three consecutive Final Four appearances from 2006 to 2008. As a member of the AAWU, Pacific-8 and then Pacific-10, UCLA set an NCAA Division I record with 13 consecutive regular season conference titles between 1967 and 1979 which stood until tied by Kansas in 2017. UCLA is scheduled to join the Big Ten Conference in 2024.\nNCAA records.\nUCLA men's basketball has set several NCAA records.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1919–1948).\nIn 1919, Fred Cozens became the first head coach of the UCLA basketball and football teams. Cozens coached the basketball team for two seasons, finishing with an overall record of 21–4. Caddy Works was the head coach of the Bruins from 1921 to 1939, guiding them to a 173–159 record. Works was a lawyer by profession and coached the team only during the evenings. According to UCLA player and future Olympian Frank Lubin, Works was \"more of an honorary coach\" with little basketball knowledge. Dick Linthicum was UCLA's first All-American in any sport, earning selections in 1931 and 1932. Wilbur Johns was the UCLA basketball head coach from 1939 to 1948, guiding the Bruins to a 93–120 record.\nJohn Wooden era (1948–1975).\nFrom 1948 to 1975, John Wooden, nicknamed the \"Wizard of Westwood\", served as UCLA's head coach. He won ten NCAA national championships in a 12-year period, including a run of seven in a row that shattered the previous record of only two consecutive titles; to this day, no other team has won more than two straight titles. Within this period, his teams won a men's basketball-record 88 consecutive games.\nPrior to Wooden's arrival, UCLA had only won two conference championships in the previous 18 years. In his first season, Wooden guided a UCLA team that had finished with a 12–13 record the previous year to a 22–7 record—then the most wins in a season in program history—and the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division championship. In his second season, Wooden led the Bruins to a 24–7 record and the PCC championship. The Bruins would win the division title in each of the next two seasons and the conference title in the latter season. Up to that time, UCLA had won only two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and it had not won a conference title of any kind since winning the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1927.\nIn 1955–56, Wooden guided the Bruins to their first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that only came to an end in the 1956 NCAA Tournament at the hands of a University of San Francisco team that featured Bill Russell. However, UCLA was unable to maintain this level of performance over the immediate ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament as the Pete Newell-coached California teams took control of the conference at the end of the decade. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation imposed on all UCLA sports in the aftermath of a scandal involving illegal payments made to players on the school's football team, along with USC, Cal and Stanford, resulting in the dismantling of the PCC conference.\nBy 1962 the probation was no longer in place and Wooden had returned the Bruins to the top of their conference (now the Pac-12 Conference). This time, however, they would take the next step, and go on to unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college sports. A narrow loss due largely to a controversial foul call in the semifinal of the 1962 NCAA Tournament convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships. Two seasons later, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach Jerry Norman persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press defense. The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team led by Walt Hazzard and Gail Goodrich that went undefeated on its way to the school's first basketball national championship.\nWooden's team repeated as national champions the following season before the squad fell briefly in 1966 when it finished second in the conference to Oregon State. UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference champions went to the tournament. However, the Bruins' incarnation returned with a vengeance in 1967 with the arrival of sophomore All-America and MVP Lew Alcindor. The team reclaimed not only the conference title but the national crown with an undefeated season.\nIn January 1968, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the Astrodome in Houston, where Alcindor, below par with an injured eye, squared off against Elvin Hayes in the Game of the Century, which was the nation's first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71–69 behind Hayes' 39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden stated, \"We have to start over.\" They did, and went undefeated the rest of the year, avenging Houston 101–69 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. Hayes, who had been averaging 37.7 points per game, was held to only 10 points. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained the Houston center.\nThe emergence of the Bruins under Wooden vastly increased the program's popularity. Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the Men's Gym. It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal. This forced games to be moved to Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and other venues around Los Angeles when larger crowds were expected—an increasing inconvenience since the Bruins' first national title. At Wooden's urging, a much larger on-campus facility was built in time for the 1965–66 season, the nearly 13,000 seat Pauley Pavilion, .\nWooden coached his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, when UCLA trounced Stanford 93–59. Four weeks later, following a 75–74 overtime victory over Louisville in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the championship game. His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly, as his team responded with a win over Kentucky to claim Wooden's first career coaching victory over the Wildcats and his unprecedented 10th national championship in a twelve-year span.\nDuring his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the \"Wizard of Westwood\", although he personally disdained the nickname. He gained lasting fame at UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, which included seven in a row from 1967 to 1973. His UCLA teams also had a then-record winning streak of 88 games and four perfect 30–0 seasons. They also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments and 98 straight home game wins at Pauley Pavilion. Wooden was named NCAA College Basketball's \"Coach of the Year\" in 1964, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. In 1967, he was named the Henry Iba Award USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1972, he shared \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine's \"Sportsman of the Year\" award with Billie Jean King. He was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973, becoming the first to be honored as both a player and a coach.\nPost-Wooden era (1975–1988).\nFrom 1975 to 1977, Gene Bartow served as the head coach of UCLA. He guided them to a 52–9 record, including a berth in the 1976 Final Four. He coached the 1977 College Player of the Year, Marques Johnson.\nGary Cunningham became the head coach at UCLA in 1977. He coached two seasons, winning the Pacific-8 and Pacific-10 conference championships and leading UCLA to a #2 ranking in the final polls both seasons.\nLarry Brown then moved on to coach UCLA from 1979 to 1981, leading his freshman-dominated 1979–80 team to the NCAA title game before falling to Louisville, 59–54. However, that runner-up finish was later vacated by the NCAA after two players were found to be ineligible. This was one of the few times a Final Four squad had its record vacated (Villanova had its runner-up finish vacated in 1971 because Howard Porter had signed a pro contract).\nLarry Farmer was the head coach of UCLA from 1981 to 1984, guiding them to a 61–23 () record. He had recruited Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson to come play at UCLA, but then told Johnson (was drafted into the NBA in 1979) to hold off on a visit as he was more interested in Albert King. Farmer signed neither King nor Johnson, and neither recruit played for UCLA.\nIn 1984, Walt Hazzard was named the UCLA basketball coach 20 years after he was an All-America when UCLA won its first national championship. He coached for four seasons, winning 77 out of 125 games. The 1984–1985 UCLA Bruin basketball team won the NIT championship. The 1986–1987 UCLA Bruin basketball team won both the Pac-10 regular season championship as well as the inaugural Pacific-10 Conference men's basketball tournament.\nJim Harrick era (1988–1996).\nIn 1988, Jim Harrick returned to UCLA (he had spent two years as an assistant coach from 1978 to 1979) to assume head coaching duties after the firing of Walt Hazzard. During the recruiting period before his first season, he recruited Don MacLean, the most significant recruit to commit to UCLA in several years. McLean's arrival helped start a revival of the basketball program. Within four years, the Bruins were in the Elite Eight--\"officially\" their deepest advance in the tournament in 13 years, and only the second time they had gone that far since Wooden's departure.\nDuring the 1994–1995 season, he led UCLA to a 32–1 record (a loss to California was subsequently forfeited to the Bruins) and the school's eleventh national championship, its first since the 1974–75 season. The 31 actual wins would stand as a school record until the 2005–06 season. In 1996, Harrick's Bruins were upset in the first round by Princeton. Shortly before the 1997 season, UCLA fired Harrick for lying about who attended a recruiting dinner. At the time, Harrick was the second-winningest coach in school history and the only coach to achieve a National Championship at UCLA post John Wooden to date.\nSteve Lavin era (1996–2003).\nAfter the sacking of Harrick and with the departure of assistants Mark Gottfried and Lorenzo Romar for head coaching jobs shortly after the 1995 NCAA Championship season, Steve Lavin, as the assistant with the longest tenure at UCLA, was selected as interim head coach.\nLater that season on February 11, 1997, with the Bruins tied for first place in the Pac-10 with an 8–3 record, UCLA removed the \"interim\" tag from Lavin's title and formally named him as its 11th head coach. The Bruins then won their next 11 games en route to the Pac-10 title, before being eliminated by the Minnesota Gophers in the NCAA Midwest Regional Final. In seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12–4 in games involving overtime. Additionally Lavin's Bruins had a 10–4 record against the rival USC Trojans. During the period 1997–2002, Lavin's Bruins compiled nine consecutive overtime victories. These included victories over Arizona, Cincinnati (2002 NCAA second round double overtime victory over No. 1 West Region seed), Kentucky, and Stanford (then ranked No 1). The Stanford win was sealed by a last second jumper by star sophomore guard JaRon Rush.\nAt UCLA from 1996 to 2003, Lavin compiled a record of 145–78. As both an assistant and head coach, Lavin participated in 13 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (1990–2002), while working at Purdue and UCLA. During Lavin's tenure as a head coach, he was one of only two coaches in the country to lead his team to five NCAA \"Sweet 16s\" in six years (1997, 1998, 2000–2002), the other coach being Duke's Mike Krzyzewski. Lavin guided UCLA to six consecutive seasons of 20 or more wins, as well as six consecutive NCAA tournament appearances.\nLavin signed seven McDonald's High School All-Americans. Seven of Lavin's former Bruin recruits became roster members of NBA teams: Trevor Ariza, Matt Barnes, Baron Davis, Dan Gadzuric, Ryan Hollins, Jason Kapono, and Earl Watson.\nDuring Lavin's tenure as head coach, the Bruins qualified for six consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1997–2002). Lavin's record in the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament is 10–1. His winning percentage (90.9%) in the first two rounds is second only to Dean Smith in NCAA Tournament history. However, Lavin also coached the Bruins to their only loss in an NCAA tournament game played in the State of California (a 2002 loss to Missouri in San Jose).\nIn seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12–4 in games involving overtime. The Bruins defeated the No. 1 team in the country in four consecutive collegiate seasons: Stanford in 2000 and 2001, Kansas in 2002 and Arizona in 2003.\nIn March 2003, following UCLA's first losing season (10–19) in 55 years, Lavin was fired.\nDespite some success under the watch of Steve Lavin, the program wanted to regain its position in the college basketball upper echelon. Even the success in the NCAA tournament belied the fact that UCLA had earned no better than a number 4 seed with the exception of the 1997 season. The 2002–03 season turned out to be the back-breaker for Lavin as the Bruins stumbled to a 10–19 record and a 6–12 record in the conference. It was the first losing season for UCLA in over five decades. Lavin was dismissed following the season.\nBen Howland era (2003–2013).\nUCLA looked to find a coach that could move the Bruins back to the elite ranks of the Pac-10 and the country. Ben Howland's success at the University of Pittsburgh and his southern California roots made him an attractive candidate. In 2003, he left Pitt and accepted the head coaching duties at UCLA.\nHowland remedied this disappointment in his recruiting efforts. Howland produced a top tier recruiting class from athletes in southern California that fit his Big East style. Behind Lavin hold-over Dijon Thompson and Howland recruits Jordan Farmar and Arron Afflalo, UCLA produced a winning season for the first time in three years and returned to the tournament, where they lost in the first round.\nStarting the 2005–06 season with the majority of the roster made over in Howland's image and with the Lavin hold-overs (e.g., Ryan Hollins and Cedric Bozeman), the Bruins produced an excellent campaign. They finished the regular season 24–6, winning the Pac-10 Conference title. They then roared through the Pac-10 tournament, winning each game by double digits en route to only the second Pac-10 tournament championship in school history. The momentum continued into the NCAA tournament as the second-seeded Bruins defeated Gonzaga in the Sweet Sixteen. They then upset top-seeded Memphis to reach the school's first Final Four in 11 years. The run ended in the championship game against Florida, whose imposing front-line proved to be a matchup problem for the Bruins.\nHowland continued his success at UCLA the following year. The Bruins finished undefeated at home for the first time in 22 years, winning the Pac-10 conference title. However they lost in their first Pac-10 tournament game and were seeded second in the NCAA Tournament West Region. After a close second-round win over Indiana, Howland led the Bruins to a win over his former team, Pitt in the Sweet Sixteen. The Bruins then again upset the top seed in the West Region, Kansas, and reached the second of UCLA's first consecutive Final Fours since the John Wooden era, only to lose again to Florida in the national semifinal.\nAt the start of the 2007–08 season, expectations for UCLA were the highest ever with the arrival of Kevin Love, one of the best low-post prospects in the high school class of 2007. Combined with the emergence of Russell Westbrook and Darren Collison in the back-court, the Bruins won their 3rd consecutive Pac-10 conference title, and their second Pac-10 tournament title in three years. They received their first No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament since 1995, and once again reached the Final Four, where they faced another top seed, the Memphis Tigers. Memphis got the better of the Bruins, who returned to Westwood without a championship once again.\nHowever, the Bruins program under Howland began to struggle in subsequent seasons. After 2008, UCLA did not advance past the first weekend of the NCAA tourney, and did not qualify for the tournament in 2010 and 2012. With a 77–73 victory over Penn on December 10, 2011; Howland passed Jim Harrick for second on UCLA's all-time wins list behind John Wooden. Nonetheless, questions about how Howland was running the program began to come into focus. In February 2012, a \"Sports Illustrated\" article portrayed UCLA player Reeves Nelson as a bully on and off the court, who at times intentionally tried to injure his teammates. According to the article, Howland looked the other way and did not discipline Nelson for over two years. From 2008—the Bruins' last Final Four appearance—through 2012, at least 11 players left the UCLA program.\nAlthough the 2012–2013 Bruins won the Pac-12 regular season championship, they quickly bowed out in the first round of the NCAA tournament. On March 25, 2013, three days after being eliminated by 11th seed Minnesota, UCLA fired Howland.\nSteve Alford era (2013–2019).\nOn March 30, 2013, Steve Alford signed a seven-year, $18.2-million contract to become the head coach of UCLA, replacing the fired Ben Howland. In his first year as head coach Alford led UCLA to a Pac-12 tournament championship, a feat not accomplished since 2008. The team later went on to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 4 seed in the South regional before losing to the 1 seed Florida.\nIn his second year, the team was controversially chosen to participate in the 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as an 11 seed in the South Region, where they upset the 6 seed SMU on a game-winning goaltending call. The Bruins went on to defeat the University of Alabama at Birmingham Blazers before losing to Gonzaga in the Sweet Sixteen.\nAfter a disappointing third season in which UCLA suffered their fourth losing record since 1948, the team rebounded in the following season, going 31–5 before falling to Kentucky, again in the Sweet Sixteen, considered an underachievement given the talent level and overall record of the team. Freshman point guard Lonzo Ball, as well as the program in general, garnered national media attention for the outspoken behavior of his father LaVar Ball.\nPrior to the beginning of the 2017–18 season, the team travelled to China to participate in the annual Pac-12 China Game. On November 6 in Hangzhou, during a block of free time allotted to the players, freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill shoplifted sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton department store. They were placed under house arrest by local police the next day and required to hand over their passports. The controversy garnered immense attention due to the reputation of LiAngelo as a member of the Ball family and received significant media coverage. President Donald Trump, who was concurrently visiting China, reportedly asked General Secretary Xi Jinping to pardon the three men, and they were released back to the United States shortly after, although Ball's family questioned if the President's request was a direct reason for the release. Xi himself later reportedly denied that Trump had asked him about pardoning the UCLA players and that the General Secretary had nothing to do with their release. The players were placed on suspension from basketball activities, and were eventually suspended for the entirety of the season on December 22. LaVar Ball maintained that his son had not deserved suspension; LiAngelo Ball withdrew from UCLA and signed with a sports agent, making him ineligible for further NCAA competition.\nUCLA finished the regular season in a three-way tie for third (tied with Utah and Stanford) in the Pac-12 (21–10, 11–7), disappointingly falling to St. Bonaventure in the NCAA First Four Play-in Round. Junior guard Aaron Holiday was named to the First-team All-Pac-12 and the Pac-12 All Defensive Team, the first player to do so in the Alford era. Holiday was drafted 23 by the Indiana Pacers in the First Round of the 2018 NBA Draft.\nUCLA started the 2018–19 season ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll and won seven of its first nine games. However, they concluded non-conference play with four consecutive losses, including back-to-back home losses to mid-major teams Belmont and Liberty. The 73–58 loss to Liberty on December 29 was UCLA's most lopsided home loss in Alford's tenure. Two days after that loss, UCLA announced that Alford had been fired and that assistant coach Murry Bartow would serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. They failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, and ended the decade without a Final Four appearance for the first time since the 1950s.\nMick Cronin era (2019–present).\nOn April 9, 2019, UCLA announced the hiring of Mick Cronin as the program's 14th head coach. He was named Pac-12 Coach of the Year in his first season in 2019–20. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pac-12 Tournament and NCAA Tournament were cancelled. The following season in 2020–21, the Bruins opened the NCAA Tournament in the First Four, advancing to the Final Four after defeating No. 1 seed Michigan. No. 11 seed UCLA became the second First Four team to reach the Final Four, the school's first national semifinal since 2008, which had also been their last trip to the Elite Eight. In 2022–23, the Bruins received a No. 2 seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament, their highest seeding since they were placed No. 1 in 2008. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the third straight season, but losing two starters due to injuries, they were eliminated from the tournament for the second time in three years by Gonzaga.\nFacilities.\nThe men's basketball team played in the 2,400 seat Men's Gym from 1932 to 1965. They also played at other venues around Los Angeles, including the Pan-Pacific Auditorium and Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, when larger crowds were expected for games.\nPauley Pavilion.\nFollowing UCLA's second championship in 1965, the idea of constructing a new arena to accommodate increased interest in the team was proposed. In 1965, Pauley Pavilion, named for oil magnate Ed Pauley, was built on campus and has been the home of the Bruins basketball programs since that time. During the 2011–12 season, Pauley Pavilion underwent a complete, $136 million renovation, both inside and out, earning it the nickname of \"New Pauley.\" A new attendance record was set on March 2, 2013, when 13,727 fans watched the Bruins defeating the Arizona Wildcats 74–69.\nMo Ostin Basketball Center.\nThe Mo Ostin Basketball Center south of the Los Angeles Tennis Center and close to Pauley Pavilion, the basketball team's home court was completed in 2017 to serve as a practice facility and hub for the basketball team. On December 14, 2015, Russell Westbrook had donated a \"significant\" sum to the construction of the center, for which the facility's court was named in his honor. Westbrook's former teammate, Kevin Love, matched his contribution on September 20, 2016, for which the strength and conditioning center was named after him.\nCoaches.\nThe team has had 12 head coaches in its history, and they have won 11 NCAA Championships, the most of any school. John Wooden won 10 national championships between 1964 and 1975, and Jim Harrick won the other in 1995. The \"New York Times\" wrote that Wooden \"made UCLA the most successful team in college basketball.\" After Wooden retired, the four coaches that succeeded him resigned, and the following three—Harrick included—were fired. The average tenure of those coaches after Wooden was four years. Former coach Ben Howland led the Bruins to three consecutive Final Four appearances from 2006 to 2008.\nRivals.\nUSC.\nWhen John Wooden became the coach, UCLA turned into a national basketball powerhouse. UCLA has won 11 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments and has dominated the conference, winning two games for every one that USC won. As of the 2013–2014 season, UCLA has won or shared the conference title 31 times, and USC has won or shared the title 7 times. There have been a number of significant games in this rivalry.\nArizona.\nSince the mid-1980s, UCLA has also had a basketball rivalry with Arizona under coach Lute Olson, as the two schools competed for the Pac-10 Championship every year. Since 1985 the two teams have combined to win 27 out of the 38 conference titles. The UCLA–Arizona basketball rivalry still is seen as the match up of the two premier teams in the conference. Also, the performance of the two schools influences the national opinion of the conference.\nNotre Dame.\nUCLA had a basketball rivalry with Notre Dame that started when Digger Phelps was the Notre Dame coach and John Wooden was the UCLA coach. UCLA and Notre Dame played a home-and-home meeting for several seasons, which is otherwise uncommon outside conference play. This rivalry existed from the desire of the Notre Dame athletic department to schedule the top schools for intersectional competition. UCLA and Notre Dame played 42 times between 1966 and 1995, and the height of the rivalry was when Notre Dame ended UCLA's consecutive-game winning streak at 88 on January 19, 1974. UCLA also broke a 60-game Notre Dame winning streak in South Bend. Previous UCLA head coach Ben Howland scheduled Notre Dame four times: in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2009. After Notre Dame's victory on December 14, 2019, UCLA leads the all-time series 29–21.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nUCLA players.\nAll individuals were (or will be) inducted as players unless otherwise noted.\nUCLA coaches.\nAll individuals were inducted as coaches, though not necessarily for their service at UCLA.\nNotable players.\nSix former UCLA Bruins went on to be named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Reggie Miller, Gail Goodrich, Jamaal Wilkes, Bill Walton and Don Barksdale. Barksdale was also notable as the first player to break many color barriers, including being the first African American to be named an NCAA All-American and NBA All-Star, and the first to be selected to the US Olympic basketball team.\nIn 2021, when the NBA named its 75th Anniversary Team, four former Bruins were included: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Russell Westbrook. UCLA is tied with the University of North Carolina for the most players on the list.\nAll 14 players who have played on three NCAA Division I Championship basketball teams are from UCLA: Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Lynn Shackelford, Larry Farmer, Henry Bibby, Steve Patterson, Kenny Heitz, Jon Chapman, John Ecker, Andy Hill, Terry Schofield, Bill Sweek, and Larry Hollyfield.\nUCLA became the first school to have a top winner in both basketball and football in the same year with Gary Beban winning the Heisman Trophy and Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) winning the U.S. Basketball Writers Association player of the year award in 1968.\nUCLA has produced the most NBA Most Valuable Player Award winners, six of them by Abdul-Jabbar, one to Walton, who was Abdul-Jabbar's successor, and one to Russell Westbrook. , 104 former UCLA players have played in the NBA.\nAt the 2015 NBA All-Star Game and the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, former Bruins Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder was the MVP and Zach LaVine of the Minnesota Timberwolves was the winner of the Slam Dunk Contest.\nConsensus All-Americans.\nThe following Bruins have been named consensus first-team All-Americans:\nConferences.\nRecord vs. former Pac-12 opponents.\nUpdated March 20, 2022\nRecord vs. Big Ten Opponents.\nAll-time series includes non-conference matchups.\nUpdated April 4, 2024"

After no country decided to challenge Australasia in 1910, only the British Isles and the United States would challenge for the Cup, for the third straight edition. Also for the third straight edition, the Americans would beat the British to earn the right to play for the Cup, and for the third straight edition, the Aussies would beat the Americans for the title.\nFor the first time, however, teams were allowed to use substitute players in dead rubbers, with the United States playing Maurice McLoughlin in singles after Australasia had clinched the final. The final also marked the first time a tie was played in New Zealand, when it was played at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. Anthony Wilding, whose home city was Christchurch, and Australian Norman Brookes won the 1907 tournament for Australasia. With Wilding being absent in Europe for the 1911 competition, the chances of the Australasian team were weakened.\nRain delayed the beginning of the games scheduled for 29 December 1911, and the 1911 Davis Cup event was held between 1 and 3 January 1912. Norman Brookes beat Beals Wright in the opening match. Rodney Heath increased the lead for Australasia by beating William Larned. Australasia retained the Davis Cup through a win in the doubles, with Brookes and Alfred Dunlop being successful over Wright and McLoughlin. The fourth match was defaulted by Wright, and Larned stepped aside to give the younger McLoughlin the opportunity to play Brookes. After trailing 2 sets to 1, Brookes came back and won the match, and gave Australasia a clean 5–0 victory.\nFinal.\nUnited States vs. British Isles\nChallenge Round.\nAustralasia vs. United States"

The European team won their second consecutive competition by a score of 15 to 13 points in probably the most historic Ryder Cup. After an unbeaten record of 13–0 spanning sixty years, the U.S. team lost for the first time on home soil.\nEurope took a lead of 5 points into the Sunday singles matches, but the U.S. fought back strongly to narrow the deficit. Eamonn Darcy, who previously had a very poor Ryder Cup record, defeated Ben Crenshaw at the last hole to get Europe to 13 points. Crenshaw had broken his putter in a moment of frustration after the sixth hole and putted with his 1 iron for the last dozen holes. Bernhard Langer then halved his match with Larry Nelson and when Seve Ballesteros defeated Curtis Strange 2 &amp; 1 to total 14 points, the European victory was secured.\nThis was the last Ryder Cup in which the U.S. team did not employ captain's selections. Europe used captain's picks in 1979, 1981, 1985, and this year.\nMuirfield Village, founded and designed by U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus, has hosted the Memorial Tournament on the PGA Tour since 1976.

Prior to the final event Eamonn Darcy was in the 9th qualifying place with Mats Lanner in 10th.

Team Europe won the competition for the first time by a score of 16 to 11 points. This marked the first U.S. loss since 1957, previously the sole U.S. loss in fifty years.\nA key turning point in the matches came Saturday morning, when Craig Stadler missed a two-foot putt on the 18th hole, which would have earned a win for him and Curtis Strange over Europe's Bernhard Langer and Sandy Lyle. The match was halved, so instead of the U.S. being in the lead through three stages, the overall score was tied at 6-6. Europe went on to win three of the four Saturday afternoon matches. \"In the past, it was always us who missed those putts,\" said European captain Tony Jacklin. \"That has to crush them.\"\nEurope took that two-point lead into the Sunday singles and increased their lead throughout Sunday. It fell to Sam Torrance to secure the winning margin when he holed a putt on the 18th hole to defeat Andy North 1 up and go up 14 to 8, a six-point margin with five matches on the course.\nThis was the last Ryder Cup played in Europe that was not shown on live television in the United States. The USA Network first televised it in 1989 on cable with video provided by the BBC.

In their third competition with players from the continent, Europe showed the ability to realistically challenge the Americans. This was the first of four occasions that Tony Jacklin was the European captain and the sole occasion that his side lost.\nEntering the singles matches on Sunday, the competition was even at 8 points each. Jacklin put his best players out early, while U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus saved his for last. In the first match, Seve Ballesteros was 3 up at the turn but needed an outstanding 3-wood from a fairway bunker on the final hole to salvage par and force a half with Fuzzy Zoeller. With ten matches complete and the score at 13 points each, the outcome depended on the two singles matches remaining on the course, between José María Cañizares and Lanny Wadkins and Bernard Gallacher and Tom Watson. The U.S. victory is generally accredited to Wadkins, who hit a wedge to less than three feet (0.9 m) on the par-5 18th hole to win the hole with a birdie and halve his match against Canizares. Gallacher had trailed all day, but Watson bogeyed 16 and was only 1 up with two holes to play. He had another bogey at the par-3 17th, but Gallacher's three-foot putt for bogey missed and ended the match at 2 &amp; 1 and gave the U.S. the winning point. \nThis was the 13th consecutive win at home for the U.S. team, but they would have to wait until the 2021 Ryder Cup to post consecutive home victories. It was also the last victory for the U.S. in the Ryder Cup for eight years, until 1991.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point.

The final place in the team was allocated to the winner of the 1983 PGA Championship (which finished on August 7), provided he was not in the top 11, in which case the 12th player in the points list would qualify. Qualification based on the points list finished after the Western Open on July 3. Tom Watson needed to win the final event to guarantee his place but finished second, lifting him from 14th to 12th place in the points list and pushing Hale Irwin out of that position. The PGA Championship was won by Hal Sutton with Jack Nicklaus second. Sutton was only in his third year as a professional and hence ineligible and so Watson retained his place on the team.\nThe European team was chosen entirely from the 1983 European Tour money list as at the conclusion of the St. Mellion Timeshare TPC on September 18. Prior to the final event 10 of the players had guaranteed their places with Manuel Piñero in 11th position and Gordon J. Brand in 12th.

        "text": "The SEC men's basketball tournament is the conference tournament in basketball for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). It is a single-elimination tournament that involves all league schools (currently 14). Its seeding is based on regular season records. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament; however, the official conference championship is awarded to the team or teams with the best regular season record.\nFormat.\nWith the abandonment of divisions in SEC men's basketball starting in 2011–12, the top four teams in the conference standings received first-round byes. Bracketing was identical to that of the SEC women's basketball tournament—note that SEC women's basketball has long been organized in a single league table without divisions.\nSince the SEC expanded to 14 schools with the arrival of Missouri and Texas A&amp;M in 2012, the 2013 tournament was the first with a new format. Both men's and women's tournaments have the four bottom seeds (#11 throughout #14) playing opening-round games, with the top four seeds receiving a \"double-bye\" into the quarterfinals. \nDivisional format (1993-2011).\nBefore 2012, the top two teams in both the Eastern and Western Divisions received byes in the first round, while #3 in the East played #6 from the West, #4 played #5, etc. Each half of the bracket contained the odd-numbered seeds from one division and the even-numbered seeds from the other division, so that #2 would play the winner of the game involving #3 from the other division, and #1 would play the winner of the game involving #4 from the other division. Barring an upset, the semifinals would pit #1 from one division against #2 from the other division, and the championship game would feature the regular season winners of the two divisions, although this rarely happened in practice.\nHistory.\nThroughout its history, the SEC tournament championship basketball game has been held at various storied sites, including the Georgia Dome, Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Bridgestone Arena, the BJCC Coliseum, the Pyramid, Rupp Arena, Louisville Gardens, and (in an 2008 emergency relocation) Alexander Memorial Coliseum at Georgia Tech.\nFrom 1933 to 1950, the official SEC Champion was determined by a tournament, except for 1935. Beginning in 1951, a round-robin schedule was introduced and the SEC title was awarded to the team with the highest regular season in-conference winning percentage. From 1951 to 1964, the round-robin consisted of 14 games. In 1965 and 1966, it was expanded to 16 games with the departure of Georgia Tech from the league. From 1967 to 1991, the round-robin schedule was 18 games due to Tulane's departure. Starting with the 1991–1992 season, the SEC split into an Eastern and Western Division and began awarding division championships with the re-expansion to 12 members, but continued to recognize the SEC Champion based on a winning percentage over the new 16-game conference schedule. Divisions would be eliminated starting with the 2011–2012 season. With the addition of Texas A&amp;M and Missouri to the conference, the regular season expanded to an 18 conference game schedule starting with the 2012–13 season.\nIn 1979, the tournament was renewed with the winner receiving the SEC's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, but the official league champion remained the team(s) with the best regular season record.\nIn 2000, the Arkansas Razorbacks became the first team since the league expansion in 1992 to win the conference tournament by playing all four days, beating Georgia, Kentucky, LSU, and Auburn to receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Basketball Championships. Auburn was the first SEC team to accomplish this feat in 1985 when they defeated Ole Miss, LSU, Florida, and Alabama to win their first SEC tournament. Since then, the feat has been accomplished three times, first in 2008 by Georgia. In 2009, Mississippi State repeated that feat, defeating Georgia, South Carolina, LSU, and Tennessee to receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Basketball Championships. Auburn achieved the feat a second time in 2019, defeating Missouri, South Carolina, Florida and Tennessee.\nThe first seven games of the 2008 tournament were played at the Georgia Dome. During overtime of Game 7 between Mississippi State and Alabama, a tornado struck the downtown Atlanta area, damaging the Georgia Dome and several buildings surrounding it, including CNN Center. MSU and Alabama returned after a 64-minute delay to finish their game, but the last quarterfinal game of the day, between Georgia and Kentucky, was postponed until the next day, and the remaining four games of the tournament were moved to Alexander Memorial Coliseum at Georgia Tech. Only credentialed individuals were allowed to attend, including players' families, bands, cheerleaders, and media. No other spectators were allowed in the building.\nThe 2020 tournament was canceled after the first round due to concerns over the spread of COVID-19, after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Initially, a decision was made to play the remaining games without fans in attendance, but as the situation progressed the event was ultimately canceled outright.\nThe conference's NCAA men's basketball tournament auto-bid was awarded to the regular season champion, Kentucky. but ultimately the 2020 NCAA tournament itself would also be cancelled.\nTournaments.\nNotes.\n\"Note A: No tournament was held in 1935.\"\n\"Note B: No tournament was held from 1953 to 1978.\"\n\"Note C: No MVP Selection made from 1933 to 1952.\"\n\"Note D: The Tournament was canceled after the first round in 2020.

        "title": "Southeastern Conference baseball tournament",
        "text": "The Southeastern Conference baseball tournament (sometimes known simply as the SEC Tournament) is the conference tournament in baseball for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). It is a partially double-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season conference records. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament. The SEC Tournament champion is separate from the conference champion. The conference championship is determined solely by regular season record.\nTournament.\nThe SEC Baseball tournament is a double-elimination tournament held each year at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in Hoover, Alabama. Twelve of the 14 SEC teams qualify for the tournament. The winner earns the SEC's guaranteed bid to the NCAA Tournament. Most of the other teams who qualify for the SEC tournament more often than not earn at-large bids to the NCAA field of 64 teams, due to the reputation of the SEC as one of the nation's elite baseball conferences. With the expansion of the NCAA baseball field from 48 to 64 teams in 1999, some teams which have not made the SEC tournament have still qualified for the NCAA tournament.\nHistory.\nPre-tournament.\nTeams were split into divisions from 1951 through 1985. Each team played the other four division opponents in home-and-home three-game series. Interdivisional games were common, but did not count in the conference standings.\nFrom 1951 to 1976, the division winners played a best-of-3 series to determine the SEC champion and representative to the NCAA tournament.\n1977–1986.\nFrom 1977 to 1986, the tournament consisted of four (out of 10) teams competing in a double elimination bracket. The top two teams in each division qualified, and the winner was declared the overall champion.\nFrom 1977 to 1985, the tournament site alternated between winners of the West (odd-numbered years) and East (even-numbered years) divisions. During these seasons, Florida hosted the tournament in every even-numbered year, and Mississippi State hosted in every odd-numbered year except 1985, when LSU supplanted the Bulldogs atop the West.\nIn 1986, the SEC eliminated division play, adopting a full round-robin schedule (27 games), and the team with the best regular season conference record (LSU) earned the right to host.\n1987–1991.\nIn 1987, the tournament expanded to 6 teams (out of 10), while remaining a double-elimination tournament. Beginning with the 1988 season, the winner was no longer considered the conference's overall champion, although the winner continued to receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nIn 1990, the conference did not accept an automatic bid after lightning and heavy rain disrupted the tournament's championship game and co-champions were declared. The teams in the cancelled championship game, LSU and Mississippi State, had already received bids to the NCAA tournament by being selected as regional hosts before the SEC Tournament. LSU led 6–0 in the third inning at the time of cancellation.\nGames on the last two days of the 1991 tournament were shortened to seven innings due to torrential rain in Baton Rouge which left standing water throughout the outfield at LSU's Alex Box Stadium.\n1992.\nWith the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina to the conference, the SEC held an eight team (out of 12) double elimination tournament. The top four teams in each division qualified. The tournament followed a format that included reseeding the teams once only four were still active in the tournament.\n1993–1995.\nThe SEC held separate tournaments for the Eastern and Western divisions in 1993, 1994 and 1995. The tournament games counted in the league standings, and the team with the best winning percentage at the end of each tournament, covering 24 regular season SEC games plus tournament games, was crowned league champion. Each division tournament consisted of all six teams in that division. The SEC devised the plan in the hopes of garnering two automatic berths to the NCAA tournament for each of the tournament champions; however, the NCAA rejected the SEC plan, instead awarding one automatic bid to the division tournament champion with the highest overall winning percentage.\n1996–1997.\nFor two years, eight teams qualified for the league tournament; however, the teams seeded fifth through eighth were forced into a single-elimination play-in round. The two winners of the play-in games advanced to the main bracket, which was a six-team, double-elimination format, same as the NCAA regional format used from 1987 to 1998.\n1998–2007.\nStarting in 1998, the SEC adopted the \"Omaha\" bracket, splitting the eight qualifying teams into two four-team double elimination brackets. The division winners are seeded 1 and 2, while the remaining six teams are seeded 3 through 8. Seeds 2, 3, 6 and 7 form bracket one, while seeds 1, 4, 5 and 8 are in bracket two. The two bracket winners met in a winner-take-all championship game. This was the format used in the College World Series from 1988 through 2002, prior to the NCAA instituting a best-of-3 championship series in 2003.\nIn 1998, the top three teams in each division plus two \"wild card\" teams qualified for the tournament. In 1999, the qualification standards were changed to the top two teams in each division plus the next four based upon overall conference winning percentage, which remained in place through 2011.\nSince 1996, SEC teams have played 30 conference games (10 three-game series). From 1996 through 2012, each team played all five of its division opponents and five of six opponents from the opposite division. With the addition of Missouri and Texas A&amp;M to the SEC for the 2013 season, teams now play all six division opponents and four of seven from the opposite division.\nDuring this period, the popularity of the event rose significantly. There was speculation the Tournament could move to other larger Southern cities, including Atlanta's Turner Field, but additional RV accommodations secured the event in Hoover. \n2008–2011.\nIn 2008, the SEC adopted a \"flipped bracket\" on a trial basis. The tournament still consisted of eight teams in a double elimination bracket. However, after two days of play the undefeated team from each bracket would move into the other bracket. This reduced the number of rematches teams would have to play in order to win the tournament. A similar format is used at the Women's College World Series, although the team which wins its second game after losing its first switches brackets instead of the 2–0 team.\n2012.\nWith the addition of Texas A&amp;M and Missouri for 2013, and the lack of any \"bubble\" in recent years to the tournament (in some years, all eight teams in the tournament and a team or two that does not make the tournament would qualify for the NCAA Regionals), the SEC expanded the tournament from 8 to 10 teams. The tournament began on Tuesday and concluded on Sunday. In 2012, the SEC also began a Baseball Legends Program, which will honor four former SEC baseball standouts, with schools rotating each season.\nBoth finalists in the 2012 tournament, Mississippi State and Vanderbilt, had to play in the opening round. Since then, no team playing the opening Tuesday has advanced to the championship game.\n2013–present.\nThe 2013 format saw another expansion by two teams, bringing the total number of participants to 12. Seeds five through twelve play a single-elimination opening round, followed by the traditional double-elimination format until the semifinals, when the format reverts to single-elimination.\nIn 2016, the SEC considered bids from Nashville and New Orleans to move to Triple-A facilities in those cities. Instead, the conference extended its contract with Hoover through 2021.\nSEC championship series winners (1948–1976).\nBy school.\n\"Updated as of 2023 season\"\nSEC Tournament Champions (1977–present).\nMississippi State and LSU were declared co-champions in 1990 when the tournament was abandoned because of weather issues.\nBy school.\n\"Updated as of 2023 tournament\"\nMississippi State and LSU were declared co-champions in 1990 when the tournament was abandoned because of weather issues.\nThe SEC held separate tournaments for the Eastern and Western divisions in 1993, 1994 and 1995.

For the first time, players from continental Europe took part in the Ryder Cup (specifically, Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido of Spain). The new Team Europe replaced Great Britain and Ireland as the official opposition to the United States. It was hoped that the change would help raise the profile of the competition and bring about the end of near total domination by the United States that had existed since the end of the Second World War. However the change made no real impact at the first attempt as the United States won the competition easily by a score of 17 to 11 points and led after every session. Ballesteros and Garrido played together in all four team sessions and were 1–3; both lost their singles matches on Sunday. All four of Ballesteros' losses came against Larry Nelson.\nJack Nicklaus, age 39, failed to make the team for the first time since missing his first chance at making the team in 1967.

        "text": "Taylor Bennett (born September 12, 1985) is a former American football quarterback and former member of the Georgia House of Representatives. He began his collegiate career at Georgia Tech before transferring to the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs. He majored in International Affairs at Georgia Tech. He later enrolled as a graduate student majoring in Information Systems Security at Louisiana Tech in the fall of 2008. Taylor also obtained a Juris Doctor degree from Atlanta's John Marshall Law School.\nHe also played football professionally in Sweden in the Superserien.\nFootball career.\nHigh school.\nTaylor Bennett attended Lafayette High School in Wildwood, Missouri from 2000 to 2004.\nCollege.\nBennett was selected as the Yellow Jackets' backup quarterback before the 2004 game against the Maryland Terrapins. Prior to the 2007 season, he started in two games; in 2005 against the Connecticut Huskies when Reggie Ball had viral meningitis, and in the 2007 Gator Bowl against the West Virginia Mountaineers when Reggie Ball was academically ineligible to play. At the Connecticut game, Bennett became only the second quarterback in NCAA history to complete a pass for a touchdown in his first ever collegiate play from scrimmage. The only other quarterback to do this was former Southern California quarterback Matt Leinart. In May 2007, Bennett was given a Spring Team honorable mention by The Sporting News in recognition of his outstanding performance in spring practice.\nBennett had a mediocre showing as the starting quarterback in Georgia Tech's 2007 season, finishing 7–6, 4–4 ACC, including a loss to Fresno State. After the 2007 season, Paul Johnson was named as Georgia Tech's new head coach. Many believed that Bennett would not fit well into Johnson's option offense, and in February 2008 Bennett announced that he planned to transfer to another school for the 2008 season. On April 28, it was announced that Bennett would transfer to Louisiana Tech, and the NCAA would allow him to play in the 2008 season rather than sitting out a season as most transfers are required to do.\nBennett won the starting job for the Bulldogs during 2008 fall camp. He led his new team to a victory over the Mississippi State Bulldogs of the Southeastern Conference in the 2008 season opener. Unfortunately, this proved to be the highlight of Bennett's season with the Bulldogs. Over the first five games of the season Bennett completed only 39 percent of his passes. He threw 2 touchdowns and 5 interceptions and led the team to a 2–3 record. After a disappointing loss to Hawaii, in which Bennett threw 2 interceptions, head coach Derek Dooley announced that sophomore Ross Jenkins would start the next game against Idaho. Bennett saw little action for the rest of the season. He went 5 for 11 in only 2 games for no touchdowns and 1 interception.\nSweden.\nDuring the 2009 season, Bennett was the starting quarterback for the Stockholm Mean Machines in Stockholm, Sweden: the season ended with the club's 11th national championship. The Mean Machine had a 8–2 record in the Superserien regular season. Taylor finished the season with 1756 yards passing, 26 touchdowns, and just 3 interceptions. The team won its league playoff semi-final and then won the championship game 24-20 over the Carlstad Crusaders. \nIn the EFL European Football League the Mean Machine went 1-1, losing in the group playoff stage 22-6 to the Porvoo Butchers of Finland. The Raiders Tirol from Austria won the 2009 Eurobowl EFL final, defeating the La Courneuve Flash 30-19.\nPolitical career.\nA member of the Democratic Party, Bennett ran in a special election to replace Republican Mike Jacobs for the right to represent District 80 in the Georgia House of Representatives. He won a runoff election against former Brookhaven, Georgia mayor J. Max Davis on August 11, 2015 to capture the seat.\nIn 2016, Bennett was defeated for reelection by Atlanta attorney Meagan Hanson."

        "text": "Patrick Lee Ryan (born September 16, 1955) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers and was selected by the Jets in the 11th round of the 1978 NFL draft. After his playing career, he became a color analyst on the Vol Radio Network, broadcasting games for his alma mater.\nBiography.\nRyan was born in Hutchinson, Kansas and attended Putnam City High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He played college football at the University of Tennessee.\nRyan was selected in the 11th round of the 1978 NFL draft by the New York Jets. He played professionally for thirteen seasons, twelve seasons with the New York Jets and one season with the Philadelphia Eagles.\nRyan was primarily a backup, seeing just fifteen snaps in his first four years. His one significant season was in 1984, when he started eleven games for the Jets. He went 6–5 while throwing fourteen touchdowns and fourteen interceptions for 1,939 yards. During the 1986-87 NFL playoffs, Ryan was the starting quarterback for the Jets against the Kansas City Chiefs in the wild-card round. Throwing three touchdown passes in the game, the Jets won 35–15 for their first playoff win in four years. The following week during the divisional round against the Cleveland Browns, Ryan threw a 42-yard touchdown on a flea-flicker to give the Jets a 7–0 1st quarter lead. However, he suffered an injury that knocked him out in the second quarter (leading to the return of Ken O'Brien, who had started the regular season as quarterback), and the Jets would ultimately lose it 23–20 in double overtime, the third longest playoff game in NFL history at that time.\nAfter being cut by the Browns in the summer before the 1990 season, Ryan was working as a general contractor. The Philadelphia Eagles asked him to come out of retirement as starter Randall Cunningham and backup Jim McMahon were injured. He signed with the team in September 1991 and was deployed in their Monday Night Football matchup versus the Washington Redskins at 36 years old. He completed four passes, threw three interceptions, and was sacked twice in a 23–0 loss.

        "text": "Baseball pocket billiards or baseball pool (sometimes, in context, referred to simply as baseball) is a pocket billiards (pool) that is loosely based on the game of baseball. The game is played on a standard pool table and suitable for multiple players. In baseball pocket billiards, many of the game's features are named after baseball terms, such as the being named the \"pitcher\", the table's is \"home plate\", and each team or player is afforded \"nine innings\" to score as many \"runs\" as possible.\nThe game dates back to at least 1912, when Brunswick soberly described it in a pamphlet as \"the most fascinating game of the twentieth century.\" The winner of a game is the player with the highest run tally after all players have taken nine turns \"at bat\".\nGameplay.\nSet-up.\nBaseball pocket billiards is played with 21 numbered s. Since a standard set of pool balls is numbered 1 through 15, sets of balls numbered 16 through 21, known as \"baseball sets\", have been marketed specifically for the game, along with the oversized triangle racks needed for proper ing. The balls are racked at the end of a pool table, with the ball of the triangle centered over the (\"home plate\").\nViewed from the racker's vantage point, the 1 ball is placed at the triangle's apex, the 2 ball at the right corner, and the 3 ball at the left corner, similar to that of rotation. The 9 ball, called the \"pitcher\", is placed at what would be the center of the rack if the game were to be played with 15 balls. All other balls are placed randomly. Because most physical racks only accommodate 15 balls, the last row of balls may be placed manually after placement with a standard triangle. The opening break and subsequent breaks, if any, are performed with the from the (behind the table's ).\nObject of the game.\nBaseball pocket billiards is a game, meaning a player must call the ball to be hit and the intended pocket on all shots but for the . Any incidental balls pocketed on a successful called shot count in the player's favor but must be spotted to home plate if unsuccessful. Each player is allowed nine s at the table, played in succession, in which to score as many runs as possible. The game ends when all players have completed their rounds. The winner is the player with the most runs after all have finished their turn \"at bat\".\nScoring.\nEach legally pocketed ball garners the shooter the numerical face value of the ball. For example, pocketing the 2 and 15 balls during an inning results in a score of 17 runs for that . Scores must be contemporaneously recorded on a score sheet with the total tally for each inning marked. If a player pockets all 21 balls before his inning allotment ends, the balls are re-racked and play continues, with a re-break from the kitchen. Each inning continues until a player misses a ball or commits a .\nPenalty for fouls.\nThe penalty for a foul is a loss of turn, no score for the ball or balls pocketed on the fouled stroke, as well as no score for the immediately preceding pocketed ball during any inning. This means that if a player did not legally pocket a ball on the preceding the foul, the last ball pocketed in the last scoring inning is spotted and subtracted from that prior inning's score. All balls ed on a fouled stroke are to home plate. If the player has not yet made any balls at the time of the foul, the first subsequent ball pocketed is spotted at the inning's conclusion and does not count toward the player's score."

        "title": "West Side Tennis Club",
        "text": "The West Side Tennis Club is a private tennis club located in Forest Hills, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. The club has 38 tennis courts in all four surfaces (clay court, Har-Tru, grass court and hardcourt), a junior Olympic-size swimming pool and other amenities. It is the home of the Forest Hills Stadium (originally Forest Hills Tennis Stadium), a 14,000 seat outdoor tennis stadium and concert venue.\nThe club hosted 60 editions of the U.S. National Championships (renamed the US Open Tennis Championships in 1968), first from 1915 to 1920, and then again from 1924 to 1977. In addition, the finals of the Davis Cup were held at the club 10 times, more than any other venue. The US Pro tournament was held at the venue 11 times, and another prominent professional tournament, the Tournament of Champions, was held at the venue 3 times. The West Side Tennis Club was the venue of the Forest Hills Tennis Classic, a now-defunct WTA Tour Tier IV event, and a men's challenger event. The Open saw some of its biggest moments and changes while at West Side, including the introduction of seedings in 1927, tiebreakers in 1970, equal prize money for men and women in 1973, and night play in 1975. Currently, the stadium is used as an outdoor concert venue.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1892 when 13 original members rented land on Central Park West for three clay courts and a small clubhouse. Ten years later, the land had become too valuable, and the club moved to a site near Columbia University with room for eight courts. In 1908, the club moved again to a property at 238th Street and Broadway. The new site covered two city blocks and had 12 grass courts and 15 clay courts.\nThe club hosted the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (now known as the Davis Cup) in 1911. With crowds in the thousands, the club leadership realized that it would need to expand to a more permanent location. In 1912, a site in Forest Hills, Queens, was purchased. The signature Tudor-style clubhouse was built the next year.\nIn 1915, the United States Lawn Tennis Association National Championship, later renamed the U.S. Open, moved to West Side. By 1923, the success of the event necessitated the construction of a 14,000-seat horseshoe-shaped stadium that still stands today. The stadium's first event was the final of the International Lawn Tennis Challenge, which saw the U.S. defeat Australia.\nBeginning in 1971, the stadium was home to the annual Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Tennis Tournament which was a celebrity pro-am for charity featuring the likes of Chevy Chase, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carlos Santana, Edward M. Kennedy, Elton John and more throughout the decade.\nIn 1975, the tournament was switched to Har-Tru clay courts. By 1978, the tournament had outgrown West Side, and the USTA moved the tournament to the new USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows under USTA President William Hester's leadership. In 2008, the stadium was the site of a women's satellite tournament.\nThe New York Empire of World TeamTennis announced it would play its home matches, coached by Patrick McEnroe, at the stadium beginning with its inaugural 2016 season. The team relocated to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for its second season in 2017.\nForest Hills Stadium.\nIn addition to hosting the main court for tennis championships, the Forest Hills Stadium has been used as a concert venue featuring major artists ranging from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, the Supremes, Judy Garland, Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Donna Summer, Brand New, Arctic Monkeys, and Chance the Rapper. From 1961 to 1971, the stadium was also the location for the Forest Hills Music Festival.\nFollowing the 1978 departure of the Open the stadium fell into such disrepair that by 2011 it was called a \"crumbling ruin\" and was denied landmark status by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The West Side Tennis Club received an offer in 2010 to raze the stadium and replace it with condominiums.\nHowever, in mid-2013, the stadium re-opened as an outdoor concert venue with Mumford &amp; Sons performing the inaugural concert on August 28. Since then the Forest Hills Stadium has held a regular summer concert series featuring Santana, Zac Brown Band, D'Angelo, Van Morrison, Arctic Monkeys, and others. It is also the summer home of The New York Pops.\nFrom 2013 to 2017, an extensive four-year renovation to revitalize the historic venue included several significant upgrades. Starting with patching up concrete exterior walls, old seats were removed and replaced by initially 1,200 new seats in 2014. A permanent stage was installed, designed by Mark Fisher, renowned for his sets for Pink Floyd, U2 and the Rolling Stones. A new concourse redesign expanded it to twice its original size for attendees to relax on a grassy court as well as easier access to food and beverages concessions. In addition to reserved seating in the club and bowl were improved seating options for people with disabilities. And after 70 years the central tennis courts were replaced with a standing room general admission floor to accommodate many thousands more people. And unique VIP party lounges were created from unused spaces discovered beneath the stadium after removal of decades-worth of rubble and debris. Plans announced in 2018 to turn the stadium into a year-round venue as a winter village with an ice skating rink have yet to be realized as of 2022.\nThe stadium also has a history of use as a filming location. The Alfred Hitchcock film \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951) was filmed in part during the 1950 Davis Cup finals at the West Side Tennis Club on August 25–27, 1950. Several scenes in Wes Anderson's \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" were filmed in and around the stadium, including the \"Windswept Fields\" meltdown of Richie Tenenbaum.\nCommunity backlash.\nFollowing backlash from residents living nearby the stadium, a curfew of 10:00 p.m. was implemented for all shows. In 2014, shortly after the stadium's re-opening, concerts by Brand New and Modest Mouse, Zac Brown Band and Lil Wayne saw decibel levels above the city's noise code, leading to warnings being issued. A month after meeting with the Environmental Protection Department to discuss strategies for mitigating noise, The Replacements performed at three times over the decibel limit during their finale, and the stadium was fined $3,200. In 2015, the stadium spent $500,000 on noise suppression methods including a concrete fence and stairway covers.\nAn October 2022 concert featuring Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Japanese Breakfast resulted in 62 noise complaints, the highest number recorded for the stadium. In May 2023, the stadium was sued by the Forest Hills Gardens Corporation for violating the neighborhood's residential zoning regulations. In response, West Side Tennis Club and its booker countersued and a judge provided an injunction allowing for Burns Street to remain open for the over 30 concerts that were scheduled at Forest Hills Stadium that summer. The stadium was sued three times in total for noise complaints in 2023."

        "text": "The 18th Ryder Cup Matches were held 18–20 September 1969 at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England. The competition ended in a tie at 16 points each, when America's Jack Nicklaus conceded a three-foot (0.9 m) putt to Britain's Tony Jacklin at the 18th hole, in one of the most famous gestures of sportsmanship in all of sports. It was the first tie in Ryder Cup history, and the United States team retained the Cup.\nThe matches were marred by considerable acrimony and unsportsmanlike behavior by players on both sides. Britain's captain Eric Brown had instructed his players not to search for the opposition's ball if it ended up in the rough. American Ken Still, in the first-day foursomes, had deliberately and regularly stood too close to Briton Maurice Bembridge as he was putting. During one of the fourballs on the second day, both captains had to come out and calm down the warring players. This led to Nicklaus conceding Jacklin's final putt with the knowledge that the overall competition would end in a draw. On the previous hole, Jacklin sank a long eagle putt while Nicklaus missed his from and the match was squared. Jacklin had won the Open Championship two months earlier at nearby Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes to become the first British champion in eighteen years. After holing his final putt for par, Nicklaus picked up Jacklin's ball marker and told him, \"I don't think you would have missed it, but I wasn't going to give you the chance, either.\"\nPlaying in his first Ryder Cup at age 29, Nicklaus' gesture became known as \"the concession\" and marked the beginning of a lasting friendship between the two that has spanned nearly a half century. It was the inspiration for The Concession Golf Club in Florida near Sarasota, which was co-designed by Nicklaus and Jacklin. The two were opposing captains in the competition in 1983 and 1987. While the concession is now viewed as one of the world's greatest acts of sportsmanship, US captain Sam Snead was furious that the chance of outright victory had been given away.\nThe U.S. team had only two players with previous Ryder Cup experience, Billy Casper and Gene Littler. The team was the only one that Arnold Palmer was not a member of from his first appearance in 1961 through his final appearance in 1973.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. From 1963 through 1971 the competition format was as follows:\nWith a total of 32 points, 16 points were required to win the Cup, or 16 points were needed for the current champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeams.\nSource: \nSix places in the team were allocated to the leaders of a points list after the 1969 Open Championship. An Order of Merit style system was used, with points being earned over the previous 12 months, the best 7 performances to count. The leading six were O'Connor, Huggett, Butler, Townsend, Coles and Barnes. The remaining six places were chosen by committee the following week.\nThis was the first Ryder Cup for Nicklaus, age 29. Despite having won his seventh major title as a professional in 1967, eligibility rules set by the PGA prevented him from competing in previous editions. He competed as a player through 1981, missing only the 1979 edition, and was the non-playing captain of the U.S. team in 1983 and 1987.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource: "

Captain's selections did not exist in 1967 and Nicklaus was in a slump following his win at the Masters in 1966; entering the Masters in 1967 as the two-time defending champion, he was in 13th place in the U.S. Ryder Cup standings. Also just off the team were Dave Marr and Bob Goalby. Nicklaus and Goalby missed the cut at Augusta and Marr's T-16 finish was not enough to pass Johnny Pott for the tenth and final spot on the team. Pott was 4–0–0 in the competition.\nThe outmoded five-year rule had similarly kept Arnold Palmer off the teams in 1957 and 1959. Don January won the PGA Championship in 1967 in July, but was also at home; the only reigning major champion on either team in 1967 was Masters champion Gay Brewer.\nNicklaus competed in the Ryder Cup as a player from 1969 through 1981, missing only in 1979. He was the non-playing captain in 1983 and 1987."

From 1963 through 1971 the competition format was as follows:\nWith a total of 32 points, 16 points were required to win the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeams.\nSource:\nThe British team was determined using a points system. Compared to the system used in 1963, there was more emphasis on high finishes, points only being allocated to the leading 20 rather than the leading 40. Points were based on the actual finishing position, whereas previously non-eligible players had been excluded in determining positions. In addition, points were earned in a number of invitation events, including the Dunlop Masters, the Martini International and the Esso Golden Tournament. The Open champion remained an automatic choice but the News of the World Match Play champion was no longer guaranteed a place. Counting tournaments started with the 1964 Carroll Sweet Afton Tournament and finished with the 1965 Esso Golden Tournament. For the 1965 event the British PGA reduced the period that a tournament professional had to wait before becoming eligible for the Ryder Cup team from five years to three. This meant that ex-amateur golfers like Guy Wolstenholme (who turned professional in late 1960) and Doug Sewell (1961) became eligible. The field for the 1965 Esso Golden Tournament were the first 15 in the Ryder Cup points list. Before the event the leading seven were guaranteed their place in the team; the remaining eight being in contention for the three remaining places.

The pairings for the foursomes and the order of play in the foursomes and singles could be changed for the second set of matches. They also proposed that, for 1963, the match should be extended to three days with two set of four-ball matches on the extra day.

        "text": "The 2004–05 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team marked the 100th season of men's basketball at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. After starting the regular season with a record of 29–0 and winning the Big Ten Conference regular season title outright at 15–1, the Illini were Big Ten tournament champions. They advanced in the NCAA tournament to the national championship, marking the school's first appearance in the championship game, but lost to North Carolina, 75–70. They ended the season tying the record for most victories in a season for a men's college basketball team.\nIn 2014, \"Sports Illustrated\" voted the 2005 Illinois team as the best ever not to win a national title.\nSeason.\nOverview.\nIllinois celebrated its 100th season of varsity basketball in 2004–05. In his second season as head coach at Illinois, Bruce Weber's Illini put together the most successful season in \"U of I\" history. The Illini tied the all-time NCAA record for victories in a season with 37 wins en route to its 37–2 record (since surpassed by 2011–12 Kentucky with a 38–2 record and 2014–15 Kentucky with a 38–1 record). Illinois made its fifth all-time NCAA Final Four appearance and first since 1989. The Illini defeated Louisville in the national semifinal to advance to the championship game for the first time in school history. Illinois finished as the national runner-up, falling by five points to North Carolina in the title game.\nAbove all else, the team was noted for its impeccable ball movement on offense, and led the nation in assists. A constant flow of passes allowed for open looks from the three-point line on every play. Led by a three-guard starting lineup, the team did not rely upon sheer size and height like many other teams in order to dominate, but rather skill and teamwork. Illinois relied upon three-point shooting for its offensive firepower. Illinois' effective offense was largely attributable to the team chemistry that had developed amongst the starting five, which had gone unchanged over the two previous seasons. Defensively, the team was one of the best at guarding against the three-point shot. Illinois averaged 77.0 points per game, while allowing 61.1 points per game, for an average point differential of nearly 16 points.\nIn blowout home games, senior Nick Smith, the tallest player in University of Illinois basketball history, would take three-point shots from the top of the key. He made 4 of 11 on the season.\nRegular season.\nThe Illini started the season by setting a school record with 29 straight wins, the third best start in Big Ten history and tying the 12th best start in NCAA annals. Illinois won its second-ever game over a No. 1-ranked opponent, crushing Wake Forest 91–73 at the Assembly Hall on December 1. After the win, the Illini took over the number 1 overall spot in the national polls and held it for the remainder of the regular season, a run of 15 straight weeks. On January 25, 2005, Illinois defeated Wisconsin 75–65 at the Kohl Center, snapping the Badgers' nation-leading 38-game home court winning streak. In the process, Illinois handed the Badgers their first home court loss since a defeat to, coincidentally, Wake Forest, on December 4, 2002, and also assumed the nation's longest home court winning streak themselves.\nIllinois was ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll of 2005, another first for the program. The Illini then went on to win to its second straight outright Big Ten Championship with a 15–1 record, as Weber became the first coach in 100 years of Big Ten basketball to win consecutive outright league championships in his first two seasons.\nPost-Season.\nThe Illini won the Big Ten tournament, becoming just the second team to win both an outright Big Ten regular season title and the Big Ten tournament in the same season. In the NCAA tournament, the overall number 1 seeded Illini won their first three games by double digits.\nIn an Elite Eight matchup, Illinois fell behind early to the University of Arizona due to poor shooting behind the three-point line and sensational play by Arizona's leaders Salim Stoudamire and Channing Frye. The game featured a 15-point comeback from the Illini, triggered by several steals and Deron Williams' clutch three-point shooting, including several NBA range threes, in the last 3 minutes and 30 seconds of the game.\nThe Illini then defeated The University of Louisville 72–57, the team's largest margin of victory in the tournament, to move on to the 2005 National Championship Game against North Carolina.\nIn the national championship game, Illinois was defeated by North Carolina 70–75. North Carolina relied upon stellar post play from Sean May, who managed to get James Augustine and Jack Ingram into foul trouble, while Illinois struggled offensively with what had succeeded the rest of the season, converting only 12 of a championship game record 40 three-point field goal attempts. James Augustine played 9 minutes due to foul trouble, forcing Jack Ingram to play a huge role in the second half comeback the Illini made. For almost the entire season, Illinois was ranked #1 and North Carolina was ranked #2, respectively, in all polls, and both teams were the favorites to meet in the national championship game. The North Carolina squad would go on to field six players in the NBA draft.\nAccolades.\nBruce Weber was named National Coach of the Year by nine organizations. Dee Brown, \"The One Man Fast Break\", was named The Sporting News National Player of the Year and swept the conference honors as well, being named both Big Ten Player of the Year and Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. The Illini had three players earn consensus All-America honors in the same season for the first time ever. In addition to Brown earning consensus first-team All-America honors, Deron Williams and Luther Head were named consensus second-team All-Americans. Following the season, both Williams and Head were chosen in the first round of the NBA draft, with Head being drafted No. 24 overall by the Houston Rockets while Williams became the highest Illinois player ever drafted when he was chosen No. 3 overall by the Utah Jazz.\nTeam.\nInjuries.\nFreshman Brian Randle took a medical redshirt after punching a wall in frustration and breaking his hand during preseason practice.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"text-align: center; background:#DF4E38\"|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"text-align: center; background:#DF4E38\"|NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Home games are played at Cassell Coliseum, located on Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg.\nThe Hokies have made the NCAA tournament 13 times, the most recent appearance coming in 2022. With the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament due to COVID-19, the Hokies have made five straight appearances in the NCAA Tournament. They have reached the Sweet Sixteen twice, in 1967 and 2019. They advanced to the Elite Eight once in 1967.\nThe Hokies won the ACC Tournament title in 2022, the Metro Conference tournament title in 1979, the Southern Conference regular season championship in 1959–60, and two NIT titles in 1973 and 1995.\nHistory.\nEarly years, Southern Conference, Independent.\nThe Hokies' first intercollegiate basketball game was played January 22, 1909, resulting in a 33–26 win over Emory &amp; Henry College. During the 1909–10 campaign, the Hokies completed the only undefeated season in school history by posting an 11–0 mark.\nFrom 1921 to 1965, Virginia Tech was a member of the Southern Conference. In 45 years, Tech won one regular season conference championship. That was in 1960, when under coach Coach Chuck Noe the Hokies hit the 20-win mark for the first time. That team lost to West Virginia, led by Jerry West, in the conference tournament championship game, and therefore was not eligible to advance to the NCAA tournament.\nTech left the Southern Conference in 1965, and in its first season as an independent went to the NIT for the first time in school history, posting an overall mark of 19–5 after losing to Temple in the first round. It was coach Howie Shannon second year at the school. The next year, in the 1966–67 season, Tech earned its first trip to NCAA tournament. That year, Tech won two games in the tournament that included only 23 teams, making it to what is now called the Elite Eight. The team finished with a 20–5 record. Shannon coached at Tech for seven seasons, and posted 104 wins, with only one losing season.\nIn 1971, Tech hired 29-year old Ohio State assistant coach Don DeVoe. In 1973, Tech made its second appearance in the NIT, and stunned the country, winning four games in Madison Square Garden by a total of five points, including a heart-wrenching 92–91 overtime win over Notre Dame. At the time, the NCAA only invited 32 teams, and only winners of conference tournaments were eligible. Tech earned an independent berth in the 1975-76 NCAA tournament in a field of 32. DeVoe and Tech parted ways following that season when he refused to sign a new contract after openly admitted that he was a candidate for the vacant head coaching job at Ohio State, his alma mater.\nThe Metro Conference Era.\nIn 1978, one year after former Tech assistant Charlie Moir took the reins from DeVoe, Virginia Tech joined the Metro 7, a conference that did not have a football championship. Tech's first year in the Metro led to its first conference championship. Even though it did not compete in a round-robin regular season schedule, it was able to beat regular season champion Louisville in the semi-finals and Florida State in the tournament championship game to earn its third trip to the NCAA tournament, where it lost to NCAA runner-up Indiana State led by star Larry Bird.\nTech finished second, or tied for second, in the conference three times in the next seven years, and won 20 games in seven of its first eight seasons in the Metro. Moir guided Tech to 213 wins in 11 seasons from 1976 to 1987. The Hokies appeared in four NCAA Tournaments and went to the NIT four times in Moir's tenure as coach. Fortunes changed for the Hokies in 1986–87 when the team had its first losing season since 1969–70. Moir and Tech reached an agreement to part ways following an NCAA investigation that left the team on probation through October, 1989. Tech paid Moir $250,000 to buy out his contract.\nTech hired Moir's assistant Frankie Allen as interim head coach to lead the program in the 1987–1988 season while it searched for an athletic director to replace Bill Dooley. Allen was Moir's first recruit at Roanoke College, and that institution's first African American athlete. He had been on the Tech staff for 11 years. When Dave Braine was hired as athletic director, he gave Allen the job as head coach. Allen led the Hokies to a 19–10 record and a third place tie in the Metro conference in that year that he began as interim coach. However, he did not have another winning season in his next three years, and his contract was not renewed.\nBill Foster, former coach of Clemson and Miami took over as head coach in 1991. After two straight 10–18 seasons, the Hokies broke a five-year losing streak with an 18–10 record and a fourth-place finish in the Metro Conference in the '93–'94 season. The following year, the Hokies earned their first postseason berth since 1986, and capitalized by winning their second NIT title. The team set the school record at the time with 25 wins, including five wins in the NIT. It was their last season in the Metro Conference.\nA decade of conference and coaching changes.\nIn 1991, the Big East, previously a basketball-only conference, decided to begin play as a football conference. Miami, which had just restarted its basketball program in 1985 and played as an independent, was accepted as an \"all-sports\" member. Rutgers, Temple, West Virginia and Virginia Tech were added as \"football only\" members. Tech sought full Big East membership, including for basketball, and in March 1994, the league voted on expansion. Tech was left out of the mix as West Virginia and Rutgers got the nod. Tech was left seeking to join its fellow Metro members in an attempt to create another large conference. However, it was also left out of that mix, along with Metro member Virginia Commonwealth. The two schools sued the 12 members of the new conference, but in the end Tech had to settle for its third choice for a basketball league, the Atlantic 10.\nFoster and the Hokies took the A-10 by storm in its first year in the league, finishing tied for first in the East division of the 12-team league. It went to the NCAA tournament and won its first game before bowing out to eventual national champion Kentucky. After the following season, Foster retired, and was replaced by Bobby Hussey, one of Foster's assistants. Hussey was fired after two losing seasons. The Hokies then turned to a former nemesis as its next head coach, tapping former UVA star Ricky Stokes for the head job. In Stokes' first season, Tech's last season in the A-10, Tech eked out a 16–15 record.\nIn November 1999, Tech finally was rewarded with an invitation to full membership in the Big East Conference. However, the Hokies were overmatched their first three years in the league, winning a total of 10 games in three years, finishing last of seven teams in the East division each of those years, and never reaching the conference tournament where only the top six teams of the division made the tournament. Stokes was fired at the end of the 2003 season. Stokes was dismissed after three straight losing season in the Big East, and Tech brought in coach Seth Greenberg to right the ship.\nJoining the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nOn June 25, 2003, Virginia Tech received news it had waited anxiously to receive for a half a century - an invitation to join the ACC. In 1953, the Atlantic Coast Conference was formed by seven teams who were then members of the Southern Conference (Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest. Conference officials expressed interest in adding an eighth member, and candidates mentioned were Virginia and West Virginia. \nOn December 4, 1953, officials convened in Greensboro, North Carolina, and admitted Virginia, a former Southern Conference charter member that had been independent since 1937, into the conference. News reports said that not only was West Virginia turned down, but so was Virginia Tech.\nTech fans spent much of the next 25 years watching ACC basketball on Saturday afternoons and Wednesday evenings before their hopes were raised again in 1977, five years after South Carolina left the league with only seven members. On May 2, 1977, after making a required site visit to Blacksburg to evaluate Tech's formal application, the ACC took its first vote on expansion since Virginia was admitted in 1953. Tech did not receive the requisite five votes of the seven league teams. A year later, Georgia Tech was tapped to be the league's eighth member, expanding its footprint into the lucrative Atlanta television market.\nAnother ACC/Tech flirtation occurred in 1999 when the Big East sought to bring Miami into the conference mix. Miami ultimately decided to stay in the Big East, and the Hokies were subsequently admitted as a full members of the Big East.\nJust three years after Tech joined the Big East as full members, the ACC and Big East began a standoff that ultimately entered the courts, and governor's mansions. On May 16, 2003, the ACC voted 8–1 to enter into formal discussions with Miami, Syracuse, and Boston College, leaving Virginia Tech out of the mix. \nOn June 6, 2003, Big East members Tech, Rutgers, Connecticut, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia, entered into a suit against the ACC and two of the three proposed defectors - Miami and Boston College. (Syracuse was not named as a defendant because the plaintiffs found no examples of promises by Syracuse on which they made financial decisions). \nThe lawsuit charged that the defendants conspired \"on a scheme that is calculated to destroy the Big East and misappropriate its value for their benefit.\"\nBy June 18, 2003, it became clear that the original expansion plan would not receive the required seven votes of the nine voting schools - meaning at least three schools were holding out. University of Virginia President John Casteen had been a strong advocate of the Hokies and was vocally one of the hold-outs, likely the original \"no\" vote on May 16 when the Hokies were excluded. Virginia governor Mark Warner reportedly pressured the University of Virginia Board of Visitors (who serve as the supervisor of the university president and are appointed by the governor) to allow Casteen to continue his strong advocacy of the Hokies. Another \"no\" vote was likely Georgia Tech, whose president was Wayne Clough, a man who been on the faculty of Virginia Tech between 1982 and 1994, including as Dean of Engineering starting in 1990.\nClough was the individual who visited with Virginia Tech president Charles Steger to officially deliver the news of the ACC change of heart on June 18. (Clough maintained his home in Blacksburg after he left the university). The third ACC university that was likely supportive of the Hokies to the point of vetoing a bid to Miami, Boston College, and Syracuse was Wake Forest University The school is geographically closest to Blacksburg (in Winston-Salem, NC), but as a small private school had little in common with Tech. However, several academic relationships were forged after the 1999 Tech/ACC negotiations. When Tech finally got the seven necessary votes for invitation, the biggest surprise was that Syracuse and Boston College were left out of the mix. Boston College was invited to the ACC just months later, on October 12, 2003. Syracuse wasn't invited to join the conference until 2011. (It joined along with Pittsburgh, which had been one of the co-plaintiffs in Tech's suit against the ACC. West Virginia left the Big East for the Big 12 that same year. Another co-plaintiff, Rutgers went to the Big 10 in 2014. The fifth co-plaintiff, Connecticut, stayed with the Big East until its football members became the American Athletic Conference in 2013).\nMoving past the conference wars.\nBefore the conference controversies were settled, Tech had hired a new head coach to replace Stokes. Seth Greenberg, who was head coach at South Florida, was hired prior to the 2003–04 season. Tech had its first winning record since 1999–2000 under Greenberg, going 15–14 and advancing to its first Big East basketball tournament in Madison Square Garden. The Big East had expanded its tournament to include all teams for the first time, but since Tech finished eight in the conference with a 7–9 record, it would have made the tournament under the old format.\nTech's first season in the ACC resulted in an 8–8 conference record, good enough for a fourth seed and first-round bye in the 11-team conference tournament. Greenburg was named ACC Coach of the Year, and the Hokies advanced to their first post-season tournament since 1995. Tech beat Temple at home in the first round of the NIT, before falling to former Metro rival Memphis.\nAfter a down year in 2005–06, Tech surged for the next five years. During the 2006–07 season, Virginia Tech beat Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium and also beat top-ranked North Carolina in Blacksburg. The Hokies went on to beat fourth-ranked North Carolina in Chapel Hill that same season. The Hokies earned a bid to the NCAA tournament that season as a No. 5 seed and beat Illinois before losing to Southern Illinois. It ended the year with a 22–10 record, the first time Tech had crossed the 20-win mark since the 1995–1996 season, when it also went to the NCAA tournament.\nIn January 2009, Virginia Tech beat No. 1-ranked Wake Forest, the last unbeaten team in Division I in the 2008–09 season, marking the Hokies fourth defeat of a top-ranked team. The Hokies finished the 2009–10 season with a record of 23–8 and were snubbed for the NCAA tournament partially because they had one of the worst nonconference schedule strengths in recent memory. They received a bid to the NIT where they advanced to the third round before losing to Rhode Island. The following year Virginia Tech added another victory over a top-ranked team on February 26, 2011, when it beat No. 1 Duke, 64–60 in Cassell Coliseum. But, they again received a bid to the NIT, just missing out on the NCAA tournament.\nAfter a disappointing 2011–12 season and after nine seasons with a record of 170–123 at Virginia Tech, Greenberg was fired. James Johnson replaced him shortly thereafter. Greenberg has the second most wins all-time at Virginia Tech behind Moir.\nThe Hokies beat 15th-ranked Oklahoma State on December 1, 2012. Star Erick Green led the team to its first non-conference home defeat of a ranked opponent since 1995 by scoring 28 points. After two seasons with a record of 22–41, Johnson was fired.\nBuzz Williams takes Hokies to three straight NCAA tournaments and a Sweet 16.\nVirginia Tech hired Marquette head coach Buzz Williams as head basketball coach on March 24, 2014. Though the 2014–15 season was difficult, the 2015–16 team finished with a 20–15 record and advanced to the second round of the NIT. Finally, in 2016–17, the Hokies broke through and earned a trip to the NCAA tournament as a No. 9 seed, falling to Wisconsin in the first round.\nThe 2018–19 season saw the Hokies defeat Duke for the third consecutive time in Blacksburg. The ended the season at 24–8 (12–6 ACC), receiving the 5th seed in the Conference tournament giving them a first-round bye. They played Miami for the second time in a week in the second round, winning the game, setting up a rematch with Florida State in the quarter finals. Florida State won 65–63 in overtime. They received a bid to the NCAA Tournament as the 4th seed in the East Region. Wins over 13th seeded St. Louis and 12th seeded Liberty set a rematch with Duke in the Sweet 16. The Hokies fell to the Blue Devils, 75–73, finishing the season at 26–9.\nWilliams was announced as the new head basketball coach at Texas A&amp;M on April 3, 2019. Texas A&amp;M was required to pay Virginia Tech $750,000 in lieu of Williams completing his contract with the Hokies.\nMike Young guides Tech to ACC Tournament firsts.\nOn April 7, 2019, Virginia Tech announced the hiring of former Wofford coach Mike Young to lead the program. In his second season as head coach, Mike Young guided the Hokies to their first ever double-bye in the ACC Men's Basketball Tournament and a fourth consecutive berth in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. (In his first season, the 2020 tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.)\nOn March 12, 2022, Young coached the Hokies to the ACC tournament championship for the first time in school history. Tech won 82–67 over regular season champion Duke. The game was Mike Krzyzewski's final ACC tournament game, and his 22nd time in the championship game. It was Tech's first time in the championship. To get to the final night, they had to go into overtime to beat Clemson, then bested second seed Notre Dame, and third-seeded North Carolina. The Hokies became the lowest seeded team in history to win the tournament. By winning the ACC tournament, Tech earned its fifth straight berth in the NCAA tournament. It was only the second conference tourney championship for the Hokies, which won the Metro Conference tournament in 1979.\nRetired numbers.\nVirginia Tech has retired four jersey numbers.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Hokies have appeared in 13 NCAA tournaments.

He was a defenceman and captain for Linköpings HC in the highest Swedish league, Elitserien, and is a former member of the Chicago Blackhawks and Florida Panthers of the NHL and Atlant Moscow Oblast of the KHL\nPlaying career.\nJohansson started his senior playing career in his hometown team Linköpings HC in 1990. The club was then playing in Division 1 Södra, at the time one of Sweden's 2nd tier leagues, and Johansson who was appointed captain at an age of 18 would spend his first seven seasons there. In the 1996-97 season Linköpings HC was coached by Tommy Boustedt, and when his contract ended and he signed with the Elitserien team Västra Frölunda HC, he brought Johansson with him. Despite his relatively small stature Johansson adapted well to professional hockey, and over the following six seasons he developed into one of the league's most productive defencemen. After winning the Swedish championship with Västra Frölunda in 2003, Johansson signed a one-year contract with SCL Tigers of the Swiss Nationalliga A.\nIn March 2004, Linköpings HC, now in Elitserien, announced that Johansson had signed a 4-year contract and would make his, by the fans, long-awaited return to the club. Once again wearing the captain's C, he led his team to results never accomplished before in the club's history in the following three seasons; a second spot in the league in 2004-05, to the playoff semifinals in 2006 and to the finals in 2007.\nIn June 2007 Johansson agreed a one-year contract with NHL side, the Chicago Blackhawks. He played half the season with the Hawks that year before being traded to the Florida Panthers for a draft pick.\nOn July 24, 2008, he signed a contract with Atlant Mytishchi of the Kontinental Hockey League. In April 2009, Johansson returned to Linköpings HC and was again chosen as the team's captain.\nOn 17 September 2011, Johansson scored his 394th point in Elitserien. This made him the highest scoring defenceman in Elitserien history. He had already made the most assists as a defenceman in Elitserien history during the previous 2010–11 season.\nFollowing the 2014-15 season, Johansson announced his retirement after 25 professional seasons.\nInternational play.\nFrom May 5–21, 2006, Johansson was an alternate captain on the Swedish team that won the gold medals at the 2006 World Championships and on May 13, 2007 in the bronze medal game of the 2007 World Championships, which Sweden lost to Russia."

The Parsi community viewed these clubs as a way of cementing ties with the British colonial powers. They were sponsored by Parsi businessmen like the Wadias and the Tatas. Though the club was the first to be organised by Indians, it was closed a few years later. The Parsis were the first to start the cricket in India because they were in close contacts with the Imperial British, as they were interested in trade.

        "text": "In ice hockey, players use specialized equipment both to facilitate the play of the game and for protection as this is a sport where injuries are common, therefore, all players are encouraged to protect their bodies from bruises and severe fractures.\nThe hard surfaces of the ice and boards, pucks being shot at high speed, and other players maneuvering (and often intentionally colliding, also known as \"checking\") pose multiple safety hazards. Besides ice skates and sticks, hockey players are usually equipped with an array of safety gear to lessen their risk of serious injury. This usually includes a helmet, shoulder pads/chest protector, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts, a 'jock' athletic protector, shin pads and a neck guard. \nGoaltenders wear masks and much bulkier, specialized equipment designed to protect them from many direct hits from the puck. The hockey skate is usually made of a thick layer of leather or nylon to protect the feet and lower legs of the player from injury. Its blade is rounded on both ends to allow for easy maneuvering. Goaltenders' skates, however, have blades that are lower to the ice and more square than round; this is an advantage to the goalies, for whom lateral mobility and stability are more important than quick turns and speed.\nHistory.\nThe first skates had simple metal blades tied to regular shoes. The sticks were thin pieces of wood until the 1930s. In 1897, G.H. Merritt introduced simple goalie pads by wearing the wicket-keeper's pads. All players played in simple leather gloves, until a Detroit goalie introduced the trapper and blocker in 1948, by experimenting with a rectangular piece of leather, and a baseball catcher's glove. Jacques Plante was the first regular user of the goalie mask; Clint Benedict used a crude leather version in 1928 to protect a broken nose. The goalie mask evolved to Vladislav Tretiak design, the first helmet, and cage combo. Considered primitive by today's standard, that sort of mask is used by Chris Osgood. The other helmet and cage combo, used last by Dominik Hasek and Dan Cloutier is often questioned, citing safety concerns. The most recognized goalie mask today resembles a highly fortified motorcycle helmet with a cage attached, however, the construction is very different, being a true mask rather than a helmet.\nGoaltending equipment.\nGoalies are allowed special variations on equipment, both to increase their chance of stopping pucks and for extra protection. They offer more protection from frontal impacts, while generally providing lesser or no protection to the goalie's back. This is because a goalie should always face the action and a hit on a non-padded area is generally a mistake on the part of the goalie. Virtually all of the following equipment is required in any league:\nNormally the stick is held in the right hand with the blocker, and the catch glove is on the left. However, \"full right\" goalies reverse this, holding a right-hand curve stick in the left hand and catching with the right. This is largely personal preference, depending mostly on which hand the goalie is most comfortable catching with. The stick blade may be flat or curved to assist in playing the puck, depending on personal preference and stick handling style; a flat blade is generally better for stopping the puck, while a more curved blade allows for easier \"lifting\" of shots off the blade to the forwards/center. The shaft of the stick blade may be slightly curved to assist in picking it up off the ice when dropped.\nCompanies and brands.\nExtant companies that have produced hockey equipment but no longer do include Nike, Reebok, and Lange.\nFacemask controversy.\nYouth and college hockey players are required to wear a mask made from metal wire or transparent plastic attached to their helmet that protects their face during play. Professional and adult players may instead wear a visor that protects only their eyes, or no mask at all; however, some provincial and state legislation require full facial protection at all non-professional levels. Rules regarding visors and face masks are mildly controversial at professional levels. Some players feel that they interfere with their vision or breathing, or encourage carrying of the stick up high in a reckless manner, while others believe that they are a necessary safety precaution.\nIn fact, the adoption of safety equipment has been a gradual one at the North American professional level, where even helmets were not mandatory until the 1980s. The famous goalie, Jacques Plante, had to suffer an easy blow to the face with a flying puck in 1959 before he could persuade his coach to allow him to wear a protective goalie mask in play."

        "text": "Michael LaVern Fanning (February 2, 1953 – October 30, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a defensive tackle for ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, earning first-team All-American honors in 1974. He started in Super Bowl XIV for the Los Angeles Rams.\nCollege career.\nFanning was born in Mount Clemens, Michigan. At the University of Notre Dame, he accounted for 164 tackles. He was a starter for the Fighting Irish at defensive tackle in 1973 and 1974, and was a 1974 first-team All-America selection by the Walter Camp Foundation, \"The Sporting News\", Newspaper Enterprise Association, and \"Time\". He was a second-team selection by the Associated Press. In his years at Notre Dame, he shared the practice field with Rudy Ruettiger, whose saga was made into a Hollywood film, \"Rudy\".\nNotre Dame ranked second in the nation in total defense in 1973 and the Irish claimed the national championship with an 11–0 record. In 1974, the defense ranked first in the nation, allowing only 195.2 yards per game and were ranked sixth in the nation in the final AP poll.\nNFL career.\nFanning was drafted on the first round (9th selection) of the 1975 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He was touted to be the successor to Merlin Olsen, who was entering his 14th season in 1975. As a rookie, Fanning broke his leg, and saw limited action after returning midseason. In 1976, in spot duty for Olsen, he recorded four sacks.\nFanning took over as the starter at left tackle in 1979 after an injury to Cody Jones. Fanning had eight sacks in 1979 and ten sacks in 1980. He led the Rams in sacks in the strike-shortened 1982 season with five.\nPrior to the 1983 season, Fanning was traded to the Detroit Lions. He played one season with the Lions and was signed as a free agent by the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. He had seven sacks in 1984 as a pass-rush specialist for the Seahawks.\nLater life.\nIn 2009, Fanning joined the University of Tulsa athletic department, where he worked for 14 years. He initially worked with group ticket sales, before serving as the special assistant for administration and operations until his death.\nFanning died on October 30, 2022, at the age of 69."

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club first-class matches",
        "text": "This article is a summary of 2,789 first-class cricket matches played by Somerset County Cricket Club to the end of the 2023 season. \nFirst-Class Status.\nSomerset is generally regarded as a first-class team from 1882 to 1885 and from their entry into the County Championship in 1891. \nThe record is complicated by a number of matches that W G Grace played for Gloucestershire against Somerset between 1879 and 1885. Wisden and Playfair recognise all of these as first-class and they are included in Grace's career figures, which have been his accepted figures since 1916 and are used in the Wikipedia article about Grace. The earlier matches in the series are not regarded as first-class by some statisticians and this article on Somerset CCC matches does not include the matches that are in dispute. For more information about this issue, see Variations in First-Class Cricket Statistics.\nSome publications also include a match organised by Somerset against Cambridge University at Cambridge in 1892. Somerset only had 10 players and enlisted two additional players (Gregor MacGregor and Norman Cooper) in what became a 12-a-side match (although only 11 players fielded). The match was retitled Cambridge University v H.T. Hewett's XII, Hewett being the captain of the visiting side. The match was won by Hewett's team.\nNotes.\nThe 23 inter-county matches played between 1882 and 1885 were before the County Championship started. All inter-county contests since 1891 have been in the Championship except for the following 8 friendly matches:\nWorcestershire did not compete in the Championship in 1919.\nAll but six of the first-class matches played by Somerset have been eleven-a-side. The six others were twelve-a-side matches played against Oxford University in 1893, 1896, 1899, 1902, 1903 and 1904. Twelve Somerset players played against the South Africans in 1912 when Harry Chidgey was replaced by Bruce Hylton-Stewart after being injured. In 1885 against Hampshire at Southampton, Somerset only had nine players.\nMost first-class matches have been of three-day duration. From 1988 to 1992 six Championship matches each season were four-day matches and from 1993 all Championship matches have been of four days. The first four-day non-championship match was that against the Australians in 1997. Since then the matches against New Zealand (1999), West Indies (2000), Australians (2001), and Sri Lanka A (2004) have been four-day matches. Four matches against M.C.C. between 1882 and 1891 were two-day matches as were the 15 matches played in 1919.\nTwo matches played under the single-innings rule for matches which have delayed starts have ended in results, both defeats for Somerset. The 1954 victory by Yorkshire at Bradford is included as a draw while the 1986 victory by Derbyshire at Taunton is included as a defeat for Somerset. This is in line with the Championship tables at the time.\nSummary against each opponent.\nIn the following table the County Championship summary is limited to matches played from 1891. Inter-County matches played between 1882 and 1885 are listed separately as are County friendly matches. Bob Willis Trophy games are included in the County Championship totals.\nThe match against Oxford Universities in 2000 (which included Oxford Brookes University) is included here in the Oxford University totals. The match in 2008 against Cambridge University UCCE is included here in the Cambridge University totals.\nSummary on each home ground.\nCurrently first-class matches are only played at Taunton. Only 2 other first-class matches have been played on the following grounds. These were matches played at Taunton between East Africa and Sri Lanka, after both teams had played in the 1975 World Cup, and a West Indies A v India A match in 2018. Bob Willis Trophy games are included in the County Championship totals.\nIn the following table click on the 'CA' to access the Cricket Archive Records section for the ground.\nBetween 1882 and 1885 10 inter-county home matches were played at Taunton (3 won, 7 lost) and 1 at Bath, Lansdown CC (won). Since 1891 2 friendly inter-county home matches have been played at Taunton (2 drawn), 1 at Bath, Recreation Ground (won) and 1 at Bristol, Imperial Athletic Ground (drawn).\nSeason by season summary.\nIn the following table the final position is given together with the number of teams in the County Championship so that 5=/9 means that Somerset were equal 5th out of the 9 teams competing. From 2000 the County Championship has been divided into two divisions shown here as D1 for Division 1 and D2 for Division 2. Bob Willis Trophy games are included in the County Championship totals.\nAbandoned matches.\nAll these matches were abandoned because of bad weather, except for the match in 1914 which was abandoned because of the impending war."

        "text": "Horse Racing Ireland (HRI; ) is the governing body of horse racing on the island of Ireland. It is based in the Curragh, County Kildare, next to the racecourse of that name. HRI was founded in 2001, succeeding the Irish Horseracing Authority, itself the 1994 successor to the Racing Board founded in 1945.\nHRI's mission statement is \"to develop and promote Ireland as a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding\". Like most other sports, horse racing is run on an All-Ireland basis, so HRI is responsible for racing in both the Republic of Ireland, which has 24 racecourses, and Northern Ireland, which has two racecourses. The remit of the British Horseracing Authority does not extend to Northern Ireland.\nIn April 2020 the then-CEO of HRI, Brian Kavanagh, said that with the benefit of hindsight the 2020 Cheltenham Festival should not have taken place.\nBusiness.\nIn addition to fulfilling regulatory and promotional functions, HRI owns Fairyhouse, Leopardstown, Navan and Tipperary racecourses. The group's chairperson since May 2018 has been Nicky Hartery and its CEO is Suzanne Eade, who succeeded Brian Kavanagh in September 2021.\nThe industry contributes significantly to the Irish economy. Figures released by HRI showed that bloodstock sales, Tote betting and racecourse attendances produced significant growth in 2011, marking a positive upturn for the industry which had suffered severe contraction since 2007 across almost all areas. In 2004 this contribution was estimated to be in the region of €330 million."

        "text": "The 28th Ryder Cup Matches were held 22–24 September 1989 at The Belfry in Wishaw, Warwickshire, England, near Sutton Coldfield.\nFor only the second time, the competition ended in a draw at 14 points each, but the European team retained the Cup since they had won it outright in 1987. Europe held a two-point lead, 9 to 7, entering the singles matches on Sunday, and the match which retained the Cup for Europe was the eighth, between José María Cañizares and Ken Green. Cañizares made a two-foot (0.6 m) putt on the 18th green to win 1 up and give Europe a 14–10 lead, with four matches remaining on the course. The final four matches all resulted in U.S. wins and an overall draw.\nThis was the first Ryder Cup played in Europe to be televised live in the United States. It was carried by the USA Network on cable, with video provided by the BBC.\nThe U.S. television coverage in 1985 was a highlight show on ESPN in early November, over a month after its completion. NBC Sports took over live weekend coverage in 1991 in South Carolina, and 1993 marked the first time a major U.S. network televised it live from Europe.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format in 1989 was as follows:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeams.\nThe selection process for the European team remained the same as used in 1985 and 1987, with nine players chosen from the 1989 European Tour money list at the conclusion of the German Open on 27 August and the remaining three team members being chosen immediately afterwards by the team captain, Tony Jacklin. Prior to the final event Philip Walton was in the 9th qualifying place with Cañizares in 10th. Cañizares finished joint fifth in the German Open and took the final qualifying place with Walton dropping to 11th place behind Bernhard Langer who finished in 10th. Jacklin's choices were Langer, Christy O'Connor Jnr and Howard Clark. 1988 Masters winner Sandy Lyle had previously told Jacklin that he did not wish to be considered for selection.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow.

        "title": "Professional ice hockey",
        "text": "Professional ice hockey (hockey) is the competition of ice hockey in which participants are paid to play. Professional competition began in North America in the United States—in Pennsylvania and Michigan—and in Canada around 1900. Professional ice hockey expanded across Canada and the United States and eventually to many other countries. There are major leagues around the world, including the National Hockey League in North America, the Kontinental Hockey League in Europe and Asia, and the Swedish Hockey League in Europe, as well as minor leagues such as the American Hockey League and ECHL in North America, and the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey in Canada. High-level professional hockey is also present in Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland and Switzerland; professional hockey is also played in many other countries, as diverse as Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Austria, Australia and Japan. The major professional women's league is the Professional Women's Hockey League, which began play in 2024.\nDevelopment.\nProfessional hockey developed in the United States and Canada around the turn of the 20th century. Houghton, Michigan, was formally considered the \"birthplace of professional hockey\"; however, recent investigations have proven otherwise, beginning with the establishment of the International Professional Hockey League, the first fully professional hockey league, in Houghton in 1904 following conversations between James R. Dee from Houghton, Michigan and representatives of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, a semi-professional hockey league started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1896. The International Professional Hockey League began play in 1904 with teams from Houghton, Michigan (Houghton-Portage Lakes), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh Professionals), Calumet, Michigan (Calumet-Laurium Miners), Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario (Sault Ste. Marie Marlboros), and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan (Michigan Soo Indians).\nPrior to 1904, playing for pay was not favored by major hockey circuits, as they were established as purely amateur organizations. Players who were found to be paid were marked as professional and were banned by leagues such as the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), Canadian teams were prohibited from playing in Pittsburgh, and the Canadian teams who played games against professional teams from Northern Michigan were banished by the OHA, including the two teams from Sault Ste. Marie, the Sault Ste. Marie Marlboros and Michigan Soo Indians in 1903-04. Some banned players in Ontario considered starting a professional team in 1898, and there was a proposal to start a professional league in western Ontario in 1899, but professional hockey did not take off in Canada until 1907 with the establishment of the Ontario Professional Hockey League.\nThe earliest known instance of hockey players playing publicly for pay occurred in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania when a 1902 investigation by the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) revealed that players on Pittsburgh-based teams received payment in 1901 and 1902, leading the OHA to ban any club from Pittsburgh from participating in their association, claiming there was \"ample and undeniable proof\" that clubs in Pittsburgh were \"purely professional, paying straight salaries to their players.\" The 1903-04 Portage Lakes Hockey Club is regarded as the first team to pay each of the players on the team, while players in prior years in the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League were compensated via a mix of a small monetary payment and jobs in the Pittsburgh community, with the 30 players of the then four-team Western Pennsylvania Hockey League each receiving a weekly salary ranging from $10 () to $20 () per week in January of 1903, depending upon their agreements with James Wallace Conant, which resulted in the Ontario Hockey Association considering each of these teams as a \"purely professional team\".\nBeginning with the start of 1904 season the semi-professional Pittsburgh-based teams of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League consolidated to become Pittsburgh Professionals and joined with the Houghton-Portage Lakes to become two of the original five teams of the International Professional Hockey League, marking the beginning of fully professional hockey in North America.\nBy country.\nCanada.\nProfessional leagues emerged from amateur leagues. In 1904, the predominantly U.S.-based International Professional Hockey League (IPHL) hosted the first Canadian professional team, the Canadian Soo. The league hired many amateur players away from Canada, causing the amateur leagues to convert to all-out professionalism or allow professional players in order to compete for the top players. The first Canadian professional league was the Manitoba Professional Hockey League (MPHL), formed in 1905 from member teams of the amateur Manitoba Hockey Association. The Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), formed from prior amateur hockey leagues, emerged in 1906. The ECAHA allowed teams to have professional players from the start, despite its name. In 1907, the Ontario Professional Hockey League was formed. The competition for players increased salaries, a factor in the demise of the IPHL in 1907 and the temporary end of professional hockey in the United States. In 1908, the ECAHA became fully professional, as the ECAHA's amateur teams separated from the league and competed for the new Allan Cup, a new challenge cup instituted for amateur teams. The ECAHA, now fully professional, renamed itself the ECHA. The MPHL folded in 1909, the OPHL in 1908, leaving the ECHA as the only 'elite' professional league in Canada.\nIn northern Ontario, silver mining had made small towns affluent, and mines in the area hired professional players for their ice hockey teams. By 1910, several teams in the area had hired enough professional players from the ECHA, that the teams, notably the Renfrew Creamery Kings, wanted to join the ECHA and compete for the Stanley Cup. Rebuffed by the ECHA, the mine owners formed the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1910, splitting the ECHA's teams between the Canadian Hockey Association and the NHA. The CHA dissolved after less than a month, with some teams absorbed by the NHA. After one season of extravagant salaries, the NHA team owners imposed a salary cap, causing dissension amongst the players, and closed most of the teams in mining towns.\nIn 1911, Lester and Frank Patrick, who had played in the NHA, formed the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association in British Columbia and took the opportunity to sign many of the NHA's players, notably Cyclone Taylor. In 1912, the NHA expanded west to Toronto, becoming a six-team league from Toronto to Quebec City. While the leagues competed for players, competition for the Stanley Cup brought them together for annual playoffs, starting in 1915. In November 1917, the NHA itself suspended operations and several NHA owners formed the National Hockey League (NHL) following a dispute between NHA team owners. The new league began play in December that year with four Canadian teams. The NHL continued the annual Stanley Cup playoffs with the PCHA.\nIn the west, the Western Canada Hockey League was formed in 1921 from existing teams in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The annual Stanley Cup playoffs now became a three-way championship, alternating in location between the west and the east. The PCHA would merge with the WCHL in 1924 to form the Western Hockey League before the league ceased operations in 1926. The NHL, having expanded to the U.S.A. and now with ten teams, bought out the players' contracts of the WHL and took control of the Stanley Cup, forming Canadian and American divisions; it also brought in one WHL team, the Victoria Cougars, and relocated it to the U.S. to eventually become the modern Detroit Red Wings.\nThe NHL lost Canadian teams in the 1920s and 1930s, leading to a rise in senior-level amateur teams and leagues in cities such as Quebec City and Ottawa, former NHL cities. After World War II, several of these teams became professional in the Quebec Hockey League, which included several stars such as Jean Beliveau and Willie O'Ree. In the 1950s, with the rise of NHL television broadcasts, such as those on Hockey Night in Canada, attendance suffered and the minor professional leagues folded or merged to survive. A new Western Hockey League was formed on the west coast with teams in several cities including Vancouver. The WHL's Vancouver Canucks organization would join the NHL in 1970. Since the demise of the QHL, the American Hockey League (AHL) has had Canadian teams, starting with the Quebec Aces.\nIn 1972, the World Hockey Association was formed with professional teams in Edmonton, Ottawa, Quebec City and Winnipeg. Ottawa relocated to Toronto after one season, but the other teams survived until the WHA merged with the NHL in 1979, with Edmonton, Quebec City and Winnipeg joined the NHL, along with the Hartford, Connecticut-based New England Whalers, which joined the NHL as the Hartford Whalers. The inclusion of all three Canadian WHA teams was a key point of contention in merger talks between the NHL and WHA, and only after the NHL agreed to that stipulation was agreed upon did the merger happen. In 1980, the Atlanta franchise moved to Calgary. In the 1990s, the Quebec and Winnipeg franchises relocated to the U.S., to Denver and Phoenix respectively, while Ottawa rejoined the NHL in 1992; the NHL returned to Winnipeg in 2011, and a proposal to return to Quebec currently sits in purgatory.\nOn February 16, 2005, the NHL became the first major professional team sport in North America to cancel an entire season because of a labor dispute. Play resumed again in the fall of 2005. During the dispute, controversy arose over the decision not to award the Stanley Cup; some considered this decision a violation of the terms of the Stanley Cup's handover (\"Deed of Gift\") to the NHL. Following a legal challenge, it was agreed that the Cup's trustees could award the Cup to a non-NHL team, although this did not actually occur.\nCzechoslovakia.\nIn Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Extraliga was the elite ice hockey league in Czechoslovakia from 1930 until 1993, when the country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nIn the Czech Republic, the Czech Extraliga is rooted in the Czechoslovak Extraliga. The Czech Extraliga was spun off in 1993 following the administrative break-up of Czechoslovakia. The Czech Extraliga is the highest-level ice hockey league in the Czech Republic. The name of the league is leased a general sponsor and changes frequently. In the 2003-04, 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons it was known as the Tipsport Extraliga; for 2001-01 and 2001-02 it was called the Český Telecom Extraliga, and in 1999-00 the Staropramen Extraliga. During the 2006-07 season it was known as the O2 Extraliga. Hockey Club Lev Praha (stylized as HC LEV Praha) is a professional ice hockey team located in Prague, Czech Republic, which debuts in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in 2012–13.\nIn Slovakia, the Slovak Extraliga is the highest-level ice hockey league in Slovakia. The name of the league is leased to sponsor and changes frequently. From 1993/94 to 1997/98 season, it was called Extraliga, then the name changed to West Extraliga until the end of 2000/01 season. In 2001/02, its name was Boss Extraliga. Since 2002/03 season to 2004/05, the name changed to ST Extraliga and in 2005/06 to T-Com Extraliga. From January 16, 2007, the name changed to Slovnaft Extraliga when a general sponsor agreement with Slovnaft was signed. The agreement is valid until the end of 2007/08 season. The Slovak Extraliga is also rooted in the Czechoslovak Extraliga. The 1993/94 season was the first season of Slovak Extraliga as Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993. Hockey Club Slovan Bratislava (Slovak: Hokejový klub Slovan Bratislava) is a professional ice hockey club based in Bratislava, Slovakia. In 2012, they left the Slovak Extraliga and joined the international Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). The club has won eight Slovak championships (most recently in 2012) and one Czechoslovak championship (1979).\nFinland.\nIn Finland, SM-liiga is the top professional ice hockey league in Finland and is regarded as one of the top leagues in Europe. It was constituted in 1975 to replace SM-sarja, which was fundamentally an amateur league. SM-liiga has an agreement of cooperation with Finnish ice hockey federation Suomen Jääkiekkoliitto. SM is a common abbreviation for Suomen mestaruus, \"Finnish championship\". At the moment, there are 14 teams. SM-liiga was closed in 2000 so that no team can be relegated to or promoted from the lower leagues without approval of the board of SM-liiga. The board have committed themselves to promote the first winner of Mestis (the second highest competition) that meets certain standards. The Finnish ice hockey championship has been played since 1928.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (German Hockey League, shortname DEL) is a German high-calibre ice hockey league, and has the highest number of American and Canadian players overseas. It was formed as a replacement for the Bundesliga. It dates back to 1958.\nSoviet Union and successors.\nThe highest league in the Soviet Union was the Soviet Championship League, founded in 1946. This evolved into an elite league with a talent level comparable to the NHL. However, it was always considered an \"amateur\" league, rather than professional. This was because all elite athletes in the Soviet Union were conscripted into the Red Army, Red Air Force or other national institutions. Technically they were paid for their military service, and not for their play as athletes. This allowed them compete at the Olympic games without violating the International Olympic Committee's amateur-only rules of the era.\nThroughout the history of the Soviet league, Red Army-affiliated CSKA Moscow dominated, winning 32 of the 46 championship seasons.\nThe Soviet League's talent level was severely diminished following the fall of communism when most elite players moved to the NHL in search of higher pay. The league also changed its name to the CIS Championship in 1991-1992, and then to the International Hockey League from 1992 to 1996. After the communist era ended, the league became explicitly professional.\nBy 1996, most of former Soviet republics had created their own national leagues: including the Estonian Ice Hockey Association, Kazakhstani Championship, Latvian Hockey League, Lithuania Hockey League, and Ukrainian Major League. The remnant Russian Federation-based teams created the Russian Super League.\nThe Russian Pro Hockey League's \"Super League\" was the highest level of play in Russia from 1996 to 2008. During the 2000s (decade) the calibre of play and the league economics recovered as the Russian economy did. Before the 2008-09 season the RSL was reformed into the Kontinental Hockey League which includes teams from several other former Soviet republics (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine) and plans to expand further.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden, the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) is the highest-level professional ice hockey league. It is generally regarded as one of the top leagues of Europe, and one of the Swedish major professional sports league. SHL, or the Swedish Elite League, which it is often unofficially called in English, is composed of 14 teams. The first season under the former name Elitserien was played in 1975–76. The Swedish ice hockey championships has been played in various forms since 1922.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Switzerland, the Nationalliga A (German), or Ligue Nationale A (French), or Lega Nazionale A (Italian) is the top tier of the Nationalliga or Ligue Nationale or Lega Nazionale, the main professional ice hockey league in Switzerland. It is the oldest league remaining today, dating to 1916.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBetween the wars, British ice hockey grew rapidly with new ice rinks and an influx of Canadian players. A European competition was instituted, and in the 1936 Winter Olympics at Garmisch, Germany, Great Britain won the gold medal, imposing the first ever Olympic defeat on the Canadians. However, because of the disruption of World War II and a lack of suitable venues afterwards the sport faded rapidly.\nAs of 2012, the ten-team, two-division professional Elite Ice Hockey League is the highest level of competition in the United Kingdom and features teams from each of the four Home Nations.\nUnited States.\nMuch as was the case of the concurrent development of professional gridiron football, the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metropolitan area was one of the first areas to promote a professional ice hockey team. The Western Pennsylvania Hockey League began hiring professional players in 1902 and acted as a pro–am league. This league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the International Professional Hockey League in 1904, with Houghton, Michigan dentist Jack Gibson its founder. While this league had folded by 1907, it was the start of professional hockey. The United States would continue to see professional hockey with teams from the PCHL, beginning with the Portland Rosebuds, followed by a Seattle-based franchise a year later. When the Boston Bruins joined the NHL in 1924, the United States was finally represented in the league. It would continue to grow in the NHL until a peak in the 2000s (decade), when 24 of the NHL's 30 teams were in the United States (the loss of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg in 2011 reduced this number to 23; it returned to 24 American teams when the Vegas Golden Knights joined in 2017). The NHL reached a higher peak when the Seattle Kraken joined the league in 2021-22 as the 25th American team. There are several other pro leagues in the US as well; as of 2019 these include the AHL, ECHL, SPHL, and FPHL. The AHL and ECHL are official minor leagues to the NHL, with the ECHL subservient to the AHL; the FPHL and SPHL operate as low-level independents.\nThe NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues of the United States. It is historically most popular in areas near the Canada–US border and along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.\nInternational.\nThere is no single global championship for professional ice hockey. The most elite North American teams compete for the Stanley Cup as their championship. Created in 1892, the Stanley Cup was originally an amateur trophy. Starting in 1907, professionals were allowed to compete for it. Teams from several leagues played for the Stanley Cup before 1926, since which time the cup's trustees have ceded control of the trophy to the National Hockey League (NHL). The terms of the NHL's control over the trophy extended only so long as the NHL remained the undisputed, most dominant professional hockey league in the world, a distinction that arguably was voided in the 1970s after Russian teams played, and often defeated, NHL teams but has not been formally challenged since that time.\nThe most elite European clubs have competed in the Europa Cup from 1965 to 1997, the European Hockey League from 1996 to 2000, the IIHF European Champions Cup 2005 to 2008 and the Champions Hockey League in 2008. The Champions Hockey League returned for the 2014-15 season and has since been held yearly. The most successful North American team is the Montreal Canadiens who have won 24 Stanley Cups, the most successful European club is HC CSKA Moscow which has won 20 European Cups.\nTeams from North American and Europe do not regularly compete against each other in \"friendlies\" as do soccer clubs, although efforts to expand intercontinental play have increased since the new 2000 millennium. The opportunities for fans and media to compare levels of play between the continents were especially limited during the Cold War since many of Europe’s best clubs were behind the Iron Curtain. After the success of the Summit Series which featured the Canadian and Soviet national teams, there was a demand for more international hockey at the club level. It has also proved that Soviet hockey was at a comparable level to the NHL. This led to the Super Series which from 1975 to 1991 featured an annual tour of North America by a Soviet hockey club. The first Super Series featured CSKA Moscow against the Montreal Canadiens on New Year’s Eve 1975, in what was described in the press as a \"de facto\" world championship. The game ended as a 3-3 draw but was hailed as one of the greatest games ever played. The following week CSKA played and lost to the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers in a game infamous for its roughness. Subsequent Super Series produced more close results, but generally favoured the Soviet sides. However, following the fall of communism, many elite players from the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries went to the NHL for higher pay. The NHL became \"de facto\" the world’s most elite league as the quality of play in European leagues suffered. European leagues have, however, benefited from the frequent labor disputes in the NHL (it has locked out its players three times in an eighteen-year span), picking up players who are barred from NHL play due to lockouts.\nBetween 2000 and 2003, several NHL teams travelled outside North America to play exhibition games against some Swedish and one Finnish ice hockey teams. This series was known as the NHL Challenge.\nIn 2008, the former Russian Super League was refounded as the Kontinental Hockey League, expanded into Belarus, Latvia, and Kazakhstan, and encouraged its clubs to aggressively seek talented players (sometimes at the expense of the NHL), prompting the media to speculate about eventual KHL challenge to the NHL dominance of international hockey.\nAlso in 2008, the new Champions Hockey League was created to provide an elite tournament for the best teams in Europe. The winner of the Champions Hockey League will face an NHL challenger each year in the Victoria Cup providing a regular contest between NHL and European teams since the end of the Super Series in 1991. The Champions League was suspended for the 2009-10 season due to withdrawal of sponsors such as Gazprom.\nIn 2009, KHL and Gazprom executive Alexander Medvedev proposed merging the KHL into a new pan-European league called United Hockey Europe.\nSince 2007, the NHL has operated the NHL Premiere series, which brings a limited number of NHL teams (usually four) to Europe to compete in exhibition games against both each other and local professional teams. The NHL teams have won a large majority of the games against European clubs.\nWomen's hockey.\nIn North America, professional women's hockey developed much later than in the men's game, and has seen starts and stops. The Canadian Women's Hockey League, founded in 2014, did not pay salaries, but did pay stipends and bonuses. It folded in 2019 due to financial instability. The National Women's Hockey League (NWHL), the first women's league to pay salaries, was established in the United States in 2015 and expanded into Canada in 2020. However, hundreds of prominent women's players, including Canadian and American Olympians, founded the Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association and opted to boycott existing leagues in pursuit of a unified, financially stable professional league. In 2023, the NWHL—rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation in 2021—was purchased and ultimately dissolved as part of the foundation of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), the unified league many players had been working towards. The league debuted in January 2024."

        "text": "Joseph Cartwright (29 December 1890 – 17 December 1949) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and 1920s. He played at representative level for Great Britain, England and Lancashire, and at club level for Leigh (Heritage № 209), as a , i.e. number 9, during the era of contested scrums.\nFamily and early life.\nCartwright was born in Leigh, Greater Manchester in December 1890, the ninth child of coal miner Allen Cartwright and Ellen Houghton Cartwright. By 1911, he was also working as a colliery foreman assistant while playing rugby. He married Mary Alice Newton in 1921 in Leigh. They had four children: Sydney (born 9 January 1921), Marion (born 5 October 1922), Alice (born 28 May 1924) and Harold (born 1 May 1926).\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nJoe Cartwright made 348 appearances for Leigh between 1911 and 1927, scoring seven tries.\nInternational honours.\nJoe Cartwright won caps for England while at Leigh in 1921 against Wales, Other Nationalities, and Australia, in 1922 against Wales, and in 1923 against Wales (2 matches), he was selected to go on the 1920 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, and he won caps for Great Britain while at Leigh in 1920 against Australia, and New Zealand (3 matches), and in 1921-22 against Australia (3 matches).\nCounty honours.\nJoe Cartwright won caps for Lancashire while at Leigh.\nChallenge Cup Final appearances.\nJoe Cartwright played in Leigh's 13-0 victory over Halifax in the 1920–21 Challenge Cup Final during the 1920–21 season at The Cliff, Broughton on Saturday 30 April 1921, in front of a crowd of 25,000.\nRetirement and death.\nJoe Cartwright retired from playing football in 1926, and he started work at the Parsonage Colliery, Leigh building underground roads. After his death in December 1949, an inquiry was held to determine if it was caused by work conditions, at which point his health was investigated. Cartwright had not been employed at the colliery very long when he was struck in the back by a sharp piece of stone, and he was out of work 15 weeks. In 1937, Cartwright was treated by Dr. Hayward for eye trouble. Around 1947 he had an accident in the mine when he was struck in the right eye by a piece of stone, which opened up an old footballing wound. In 1939, he was still employed at the colliery working as a hewer.\nIn July 1949, Cartwright was forced to retire from the colliery because of a persistent cough. Nurse Ellen Wilcock of Leigh Infirmary said that on 16 December 1949 his condition worsened and he died the next day. Dr. S. H. Jackson of the University of Manchester, the pathologist who conducted Cartwright's autopsy, said that in his opinion Cartwright's death was due to toxic absorption caused chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema) of the right lung. When questioned by C. L. Tyrer, the President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation, Dr. S. H. Jackson said he had found slight traces of pneumoconiosis in Cartwright, but that this had not accelerated his death. At Leigh Police Station, the district coroner, R. M. Barlow, said that he had heard the impartial evidence of the pathologist, and in his opinion he was quite satisfied that the pneumoconiosis had not caused death in any way, and so returned a verdict of death from natural causes."

        "text": "Willie Aaron Green (born April 2, 1966) is a former professional American football wide receiver who played for the Detroit Lions, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Carolina Panthers, and the Denver Broncos in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at the University of Mississippi.\nEarly years.\nGreen was born April 2, 1966, in Athens, Georgia, to politically active parents Willie and Corene. He played football in 1984 and 1985 at Clarke Central, where he was not widely considered the best player on either team. Green himself admitted \"I couldn't compete with them... The bottom line is I never thought I would play a professional sport in anything.\" He transferred to the Tennessee Military Institute for his senior year.\nCollege.\nGreen decided not to return to Athens and the University of Georgia, instead attending Ole Miss. He later commented his family encouraged him to cut childhood ties, and attend school in \"a small country town (Oxford, Mississippi) so the only thing you could do was get your education and go to school. There wasn't enough room for trouble.\" The lack of distractions paid off. After a 200-yard freshman season in 1986, Green led the Rebels in receiving yards each of the next three seasons, including a then-record 816 yards his senior year in tandem with future pro-bowl tight end Wesley Walls to finish his career with a then-school-record 2,274 yards. He was in the SEC's top 10 each of these three years in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns, and was named second-team All-SEC as a senior. , he ranks 6th in career receiving yards, 7th for a single season, and 9th in career touchdowns.\nOle Miss statistics\nNFL career.\nGreen nearly went undrafted in 1990, finally being selected by the Detroit Lions in the eighth round (194th overall). A shoulder injury side-lined him his entire first season. However, in 1991 he emerged as the team's leading touchdown receiver with seven touchdowns, and finished third in yardage as part of a balanced receiving trio with Brett Perriman and Robert Clark. In the first round of the playoffs, Green had 8 receptions for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns in a win over the Dallas Cowboys. Despite consistent play in the three seasons from 1991 to 1993, he was always overshadowed by all-star running back Barry Sanders and other receivers. \"I've never been a superstar on any team... Every team I've been on, I've had to fight to stay alive,\" Green commented in 2000. With the emergence of Herman Moore, Green was cut.\nHe was signed to a one-year deal by Tampa Bay, where he had just 9 receptions in five appearances coming off the bench.\nIn 1995, the brand-new Carolina Panthers claimed him prior to the expansion team's first season. Despite starting only seven games, Green amassed 882 yards and a team-leading 6 touchdown receptions. In game 15 against Atlanta, he caught 89 yard game-winning touchdown (the second longest in team history) as part of a record-setting 36.8 yards-per-catch afternoon, and his fourth 100+ yard receiving game of the season. His 18.77 yards per reception in 1995 is still a franchise record as of 2017. Green recorded 46 receptions and 614 yards in 10 starts in the 1996 season.\nGreen finished his career in grand style, winning two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos in 1997 and 1998. He started just two games, and contributed just three post-season receptions to the two championship runs.\nNFL statistics\nLater life.\nGreen was active in his community as a teen, college player, and professional, contributing to community causes in his home of Athens, Georgia. His unusual civic involvement earned him the nickname \"The Mayor of Shelby\" during his time with the Carolina Panthers. He worked for several years as the owner of a local golf course and owner of a small check-cashing franchise. In 2011, he returned to college at Gardner–Webb University, finishing the last 30 credit hours of a degree he began at Ole Miss. Following graduation, he became a vice-president of the lender World Acceptance Corporation.\nHis son, Javarius, followed in his footsteps in football, and is a wide receiver for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels"

        "text": "Mike Siani (born May 27, 1950) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Oakland Raiders and Baltimore Colts.\nCareer.\nSiani was a high school football star with the New Dorp High School \"Centrals\", in New Dorp, Staten Island, New York City, New York, graduating in 1968. At New Dorp, Siani played for legendary coach Sal Somma. Somma and Siani have been inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame.\nSiani attended Villanova University, where he not only played football but also excelled in baseball. Between 1968 (when he was still in high school) and 1972, Siani was selected on four occasions by three Major League organizations (the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Texas Rangers), but he never signed. \nOn the football field Siani wore number 88 and earned close to 30 achievement awards. He was selected to the 1971 College Football All-America Team. Siani was inducted into the Villanova University Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.\nSiani was the first round draft choice of the Oakland Raiders. In 1972, his first year in Oakland, he set multiple rookie team records for receiving and finished as the runner-up to Franco Harris as NFL Rookie of the Year. He played for the Raiders through 1977, appearing in 74 games with 32 starts, and he caught 128 passes for 2,079 yards and 13 TDs. With the Raiders having a surplus of wide receivers, the team traded Siani along with a 1979 third-round selection (72nd overall–traded to Houston Oilers) to the Colts for Raymond Chester and a 1979 second-round pick (33rd overall–traded to Tampa Bay Buccaneers for Dave Pear) on July 21, 1978. Siani played three seasons with the Colts before finishing his NFL career in 1980.\nWhen his playing career ended, Siani was an indoor football coach for several teams, being named the interim head coach for the Myrtle Beach Stingrays, Fayetteville Guard and Florence Phantoms. He was named the head coach of the Atlantic City CardSharks in 2004, and the Richmond Raiders of the American Indoor Football Association in 2010. Siani has been employed as a scout for the New Orleans Saints, and was the quarterbacks and wide receivers coach for the Princeton Tigers Varsity Sprint Football program in 2009.\nMajor League Baseball player Michael Siani is a distant relative of Siani's. \nBooks.\n“Cheating is Encouraged: A Hard-Nosed History of the 1970s Raiders” was authored by Mike Siani and Kristine Setting Clark."

From here he went Ebbw Vale, where as a scrum-half, he played for a season, He made his first-class début for Ebbw Vale where he was outstanding. After a season, he then joined Pontypool in 1981, but not long after broke his neck. Despite being told he would never play again, he was back playing for Pontypool within a year. He only gained one cap for Wales – against Australia during the 1984 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland which Wales lost 28–9. Despite the loss Bishop was the only player to score a try against them.\nBishop had played understudy to fellow scrum-half Terry Holmes, and when Holmes switched codes to rugby league in 1985, many expected Bishop to finally be given his chance to play for Wales permanently. However, during a match versus Newbridge, Chris Jarman received a broken jaw in an off-the ball incident. Jarman brought a private prosecution resulting in Bishop being given a suspended jail sentence and an eleven-month ban by the WRU. The Welsh selectors instead picked Robert Jones of Swansea RFC. Bishop however gained his revenge in 1987-88 when Pontypool defeated Swansea at Pontypool Park in the cup, the highlight of the game being Bishop's penalty in the mud to seal the win, following which Bishop wiggled his rear end to the stand—where the Welsh selectors were sitting.\nDespite repeatedly putting in outstanding performances for Pontypool, Bishop was never picked for Wales again, though his case was not helped by several of Bishop's antics off the field. The 1987–1988 season was the most successful in the club's history when they lost only two games all season and Bishop formed a potent partnership with Mark Ring. \nWhen rugby union became openly professional in 1995, Bishop returned to Pontypool as player-coach. Although Pontypool had been relegated from the top flight of rugby in Wales in 1995. Two highlights during this period were saving Pontypool from relegation from Division 1 with a victory over UWIC and the 16–15 win over Neath RFC in the Welsh Cup in 1999. Pontypool then played Cardiff in the next round of the cup, where they were heavily defeated, but Bishop faced his old adversary Robert Jones for the last time.\nRugby league career.\nIn 1988, Bishop was lured to rugby league and he signed for Hull Kingston Rovers. He subsequently played for . He was then part of the Wales rugby league team that won a European Nations Cup and reached the 1995 Rugby League World Cup's semi-finals."

He is a former international rugby union player having played for both the Wales sevens team, and the Wales national rugby union team as well as touring with the British and Irish Lions (uncapped). His regular rugby union position was either No. 8 or blindside flanker in the back row.\nAs of 2021, he is coaching Southwell Rugby Club, who play in Midlands 2 East (North).\nRugby union career.\nBorn in Brecon, Powell attended Llandovery College, and played as an amateur for both Llandovery and in Halifax. In 1999, he joined Newport RFC, and over the following four seasons he played in fifty matches, scoring eleven tries. Mentored by South African Ian McIntosh, he made the Wales Under-21 squad. He then joined Leicester Tigers, before returning to Wales via French club AS Béziers Hérault with the Llanelli Scarlets.\nCardiff Blues: 2005–2010.\nPowell joined the Cardiff Blues in the summer of 2005, making an impact in his first season, winning a number of man of the match awards. The 2006/07 season was an exceptionally unlucky one for Powell, who injured his left shoulder in a pre-season friendly against Bristol. The injury required total shoulder reconstruction and he returned to action at the beginning of April 2007. Three games in to his comeback, he suffered an identical injury to his right shoulder, which would also require reconstruction. In December 2009, Powell was one of only three British players to be selected for the Barbarians, in their encounter with New Zealand.\nWasps: 2010–2011.\nIn July 2010, Blues agreed to release Powell from his contract, even though it had 12 months remaining, stating that Powell had \"lost his way\" since the buggy incident. Early speculation linked Powell with newly promoted French rugby union team SU Agen, and with Welsh Rugby league club Crusaders. But Powell joined London Wasps on a 12-month contract in July 2010, coached by Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards, which he hoped would improve his chances of a return to the national squad. On 5 May 2011, Powell left London Wasps by mutual consent after a drunken brawl outside a pub.\nSale Sharks: 2011–2013.\nIn May 2011, Powell signed for Sale Sharks after his release by London Wasps. In October 2012, Sale fined him £5,000 for abusive language and making offensive hand gestures to spectators.\nWigan Warriors: 2013–2014.\nIn 2013, he joined Wigan Warriors.\nNewport Gwent Dragons: 2014–2015.\nIn June 2014, it was announced that Powell had signed a deal with Newport Gwent Dragons.\nMerthyr: 2015– 2016.\nIn July 2015 Powell joined Merthyr RFC.\nIn October 2016, Merthyr announced Powell had retired from the game with immediate affect, after a re-occurring Knee injury.\nPowell later revealed he had been suffering depression, and cites the condition as a reason for his retirement.\nInternational.\nPowell played his first cap for Wales against South Africa on 8 November 2008 where he won Man of the Match in the 15 – 20 loss.\nOn 21 April 2009, Powell was named as a member of the British and Irish Lions for the 2009 tour to South Africa.\nGolf buggy incident.\nPowell was arrested \"for taking and driving away a golf buggy\" a few hours after the Welsh team's last-minute victory over Scotland in their 2010 Six Nations match. He was arrested near Junction 33 on the M4 motorway at 0600 GMT 14 February 2010. \nThe following day, for behaviour \"contrary to the squad's code of conduct\", he was removed from Wales' 35-man training squad for the Six Nations 2010, and played no further part in the tournament. He was later given a 15-month driving ban and fined after admitting the offence at Cardiff Magistrates' Court.\nRugby league.\nWelsh Super League club Crusaders made an approach to sign Powell in 2010, but the offer was rejected. Powell's then agent Mike Burton stated that Powell had a year left on his contract with Cardiff and that he would be honouring it, but Powell then parted company with Burton.\nPowell has stated that he is interested in switching to rugby league and played during his teenage years with amateur club Cardiff Demons. The Crusaders were interested in signing him for the 2010 season although he stated he would be interested playing in the next year or two and still had ambitions to represent Wales in rugby union. Powell's new agent Emanuele Palladino confirmed that Powell would not be joining the Crusaders but he remained a target for Super League clubs. After being sacked by Wasps he again received interest from Crusaders to join them after the 2011 Rugby Union World Cup.\nIn April 2013 Powell confirmed he would join Wigan Warriors at the end of the 2012–13 rugby union season. He scored his first try for Wigan Warriors in the home match v Hull FC on 30 August 2013.\nPersonal information.\nPowell married Natasha Gascoine on 25 May 2013 in Llantrisant."

        "title": "Wyoming Cowboys basketball",
        "text": "The University of Wyoming men's basketball program, which competes in the Mountain West Conference, with the schools first recorded game dating back to 1905. Wyoming won the 1943 NCAA championship under Hall of Fame coach Everett Shelton and behind star guard Ken Sailors, who pioneered the jump shot that is now the standard in basketball. Wyoming has made a total of 16 appearances in the NCAA tournament. Since the Mountain West was formed in 1999, Wyoming has won two conference titles, including an outright championship in 2002. Prior to that, Wyoming won five championships in the Western Athletic Conference, eight championships in the Skyline Conference, and one championship in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference.\nHistory.\nThe Wyoming basketball program began in 1904 when a group known as the \"Laramie Town Team\" challenged a team from the university to a basketball game; Wyoming won that game by a score of 17–5. The team became a powerhouse in the 1930s under coach Willard \"Dutch\" Witte, who led the 1934 Cowboy team to a 26–3 record. Wyoming was retroactively named the 1934 national champion by the Helms Foundation. Witte coached a total of nine seasons in Laramie and compiled a 134–51 record.\nAfter Witte stepped down in 1939, Everett Shelton took over the team and went on to become the winningest coach in Wyoming history in his 19 years in Laramie. Although Shelton went just 6–10 in his first season, his teams would win 20 or more games seven times during his career. In 1943, the Cowboys went 31–2 and won the NCAA tournament. That team was led by Ken Sailors, who scored 16 points in the championship game victory over Georgetown on his way to being named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In addition, Sailors was named college basketball's Player of the Year in 1943 and again in 1946 after returning from fighting in World War II. In all, the Cowboys made eight NCAA tournament appearances under Shelton, though they only won one game aside from the three-game run in 1943.\nAfter Shelton retired in 1959, Wyoming basketball lay dormant for some time. Including Shelton's last four campaigns as head coach, the Cowboys endured nine consecutive losing seasons from 1956 to 1964. Coach Bill Strannigan, who succeeded Shelton, had just six winning seasons in 14 years as head coach and made one NCAA Tournament appearance in 1967 in which the Cowboys were handed a lopsided loss at the hands of eventual national champion UCLA and its All-American center Lew Alcindor, who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Again from 1971 through 1978, the Cowboys had one winning season, a 17–10 campaign under Don DeVoe in 1976–77.\nIn 1978, Jim Brandenburg became the Cowboys' head coach and the program experienced a resurgence. In his nine seasons, Wyoming did not have a single losing season and made four NCAA Tournament appearances. In 1981, the Cowboys were 24–6 and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament. In addition to being the Cowboys' first tournament appearance since 1967, it was their first 20-win season since 1952–53 and first NCAA tournament victory since 1952. After guiding the Cowboys to the Sweet 16 in 1987, however, Brandenburg left the Cowboys to become the coach at conference rival San Diego State. He was replaced by Benny Dees, who went 26–6 in his first year with the Cowboys and returned them to the NCAA tournament in 1988 where they lost in the first round to Loyola Marymount.\nLarry Shyatt went 19–9 in 1997–98, his only season in Laramie before becoming the head coach at Clemson University. After his departure, Steve McClain took over the head coaching job and had three consecutive 20-win seasons from 2001 to 2003, including conference titles in 2001 and 2002 and an NCAA tournament appearance in 2002. On March 22, 2007, Wyoming hired former Portland State head coach Heath Schroyer to become its next head coach. Shyatt was hired yet again as Wyoming's head coach after the 2010–11 season ended due to the firing of Heath Schroyer. The 2010–11 team's top two scorers left the program afterwards, with Desmar Jackson and Amath M'Baye transferring to Southern Illinois University and the University of Oklahoma, respectively.\nThe Cowboys went 21–12 in Shyatt's first season, for their first 20–win season in 9 years. They made the College Basketball Invitational each of the next three seasons, making the quarterfinals in 2012 and 2013. In the 2014–15 season, the Cowboys finished with a record of 25–10, won the Mountain West Conference tournament over San Diego State 45–43, and earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Larry Nance Jr. was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the 27th pick in the 2015 NBA draft, becoming Wyoming's first player selected in the draft since Theo Ratliff in 1995. On March 21, 2016, Shyatt announced his resignation from the head coaching job, and Allen Edwards was announced as the 21st head coach in program history.\nIn Edwards' first season, the Cowboys went 23–15 and won the CBI tournament, defeating Coastal Carolina in the championship. Edwards again won 20 games in his second season. In 2019, Justin James was drafted 40th overall by the Sacramento Kings, becoming the second Cowboy in the decade to be taken in the NBA draft. On December 9, 2019, the program retired Fennis Dembo's no. 34 jersey. Following two disappointing campaigns where the Cowboys failed to win 10 games each year, Edwards was let go as head coach. Jeff Linder was hired as the 22nd head coach in program history on March 17, 2020.\nIn Linder's first season with the Cowboys, he led the team to a 14–11 year despite inheriting a team with only 6 conference wins the two seasons prior. This included a 6–1 non-conference record highlighted by a road win against eventual Elite Eight participant Oregon State. The team's season ended in the Mountain West tournament quarterfinals 69–66 to eventual champion San Diego State.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the NCAA tournament 16 times, with a combined record of 9–21. They were national champions in 1943.\nNIT results.\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) eight times, with a combined record of 7–8.\nCBI results.\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) five times, with a combined record of 7–5. They were champions in 2017.\nNational Campus Basketball Tournament results.\nThe Cowboys appeared in the only National Campus Basketball Tournament, with a record of 1–2.\nNotable players.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer leaders.\nSource:\nArena.\nThe Arena-Auditorium, which seats 11,612, serves as the home court for the Cowboy basketball team. Since its opening in 1982, the Cowboys have enjoyed a strong homecourt advantage at the AA.\nWyoming's first home court was a small, red-brick building known as the \"Little Red Gym.\" That was followed by the Half Acre Gym, which served as the Cowboys' home from 1925 to 1951 and seated just over 4,000; the Cowboys had a record of 222–44 in the building. The Cowboys moved into War Memorial Fieldhouse in 1951 and remained there until the Arena-Auditorium opened in 1982."

The club was formed in 1908, and with some disruption in the war years, has been going strong ever since.\nBrief History.\nSituated in the Fife village of Freuchie (), Scotland. The cricket club plays a large role in village community life.\nThe club's greatest moment of popular fame was the victory in the final of the National Village Cup Championship at Lord's in 1985, against a side from Surrey.\nIn the 1970s, virtually all games were friendlies against other village clubs, with the occasional friendly against one of the “big clubs” from Edinburgh; the club looked on these as major cricketing occasions, while the opponents thought them to be more of a social day out. Today, Freuchie Cricket Club meet these teams on a very competitive basis. Two of the present “home-grown” players have played for Scotland's first team, while others have played at other representative levels.\nThe 2006 season exemplified this rise in standards when the club began the year by winning the Media Sixes Indoor Six-a-Side tournament and went on to win the SNCL Division II championship with a game to spare. Meanwhile, the Second XI gained promotion from East League Division II, so this coming year sees the club competing in the first divisions of both the Scottish National (SNCL) and the East of Scotland (ESCA) leagues.\nThe club's Centenary Year was in 2008."

        "text": "The National, originally titled for sponsorship reasons as the AT&amp;T National and later as the Quicken Loans National, was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour from 2007 to 2018. It was hosted by Tiger Woods and benefited the Tiger Woods Foundation. It was usually held either in late June or during the Fourth of July weekend in the Washington, D.C. area, except for 2010 and 2011 when it was held near Philadelphia.\nThe National was a 72-hole stroke play tournament. It was one of a few events given \"invitational\" status by the PGA Tour and consequently had a field of only 120 players, as opposed to 156 players at most full-field tournaments.\nThe first edition of The National in 2007 was held July 5–8 on the Blue Course at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, northwest of Washington. The event returned to Congressional in 2008 and 2009 when it was held midway between the U.S. Open and The Open Championship to ensure a strong field of competitors. The National was part of the Open Qualifying Series that gave non-exempt players a chance to compete in The Open.\nHistory.\nThe event was officially announced on March 7, 2007, to replace The International, which tour officials had abruptly cancelled four weeks earlier on The National was a standard 72-hole stroke play event, and did not use the modified Stableford scoring system used by The International in Colorado.\nThe D.C. area had hosted a regular tour event for over a quarter century; the Kemper Open arrived in 1980, but was terminated after the 2006 event. It was played at Congressional from 1980 to 1986, then moved to the nearby TPC at Avenel in 1987. Later renamed the Booz Allen Classic, it returned to Congressional in 2005, to give Avenel time to undergo renovations, which did \nCongressional originally agreed to host the event for the first two years, and after opting out of hosting the 2009 U.S. Amateur, agreed to host the event in 2009 as well. The Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, hosted the 2010 and 2011 events, due to Congressional being reconfigured for the 2011 U.S. Open. The tournament was played at Congressional from 2012 to 2014 and returned in 2016. It was played in Virginia at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville in July and August 2015 and was played at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm in Potomac in 2017.\nOther courses that were originally considered for the new tournament were in the Kansas City, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Portland areas. Possible sites for the 2010 and 2011 events were the TPC at Avenel (now TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm, former site of the Booz Allen Classic) and Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, (four-time host of the Presidents Cup). CBS Sports and Golf Channel currently carry the Quicken Loans National on television.\nAfter the 2017 tournament, the Quicken Loans sponsorship deal ended leaving The National with no sponsor for scheduled for June 28 to July 1. The PGA Tour also announced that it would be buying out the remaining two years of its contract with Congressional Country Club to host the 2018 and 2020 Despite a lack of title sponsor and host course, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan confirmed that the event would occur in 2018, stating, \"We made the commitment. Our players are going to be showing up there and we're going to be playing for that amount of money.\" On May 30, less than a month before the event, Quicken Loans agreed to sponsor for a fifth consecutive year. On July 10, 2018, it was announced that the Detroit Golf Club would host the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2019, replacing The National.\nField.\nThe National was one of a few tournaments given \"invitational\" status by the PGA Tour, and consequently it had a reduced field of only 120 players (as opposed to most full-field open tournaments with a field of 156 players). Other tournaments with invitational status include the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the RBC Heritage, the Fort Worth Invitational, and the Memorial Tournament.\nInvitational tournaments have smaller fields (between 100 and 132 players), and have more freedom than full-field open tournaments in determining which players are eligible to participate in their event, as invitational tournaments are not required to fill their fields using the PGA Tour Priority Ranking System. Furthermore, unlike full-field open tournaments, invitational tournaments do not offer open qualifying (aka Monday qualifying). The Los Angeles Open was converted to an invitational in 2020, inheriting the National's format.\nThe field consisted of 120 players invited using the following criteria:\nWinners.\n\"Note: Green highlight indicates scoring records.\""

        "text": "Kenneth Darrell Rowe (December 31, 1933 – November 22, 2012) was an American professional baseball player and coach whose career spanned 60 seasons. The native of Ferndale, Michigan, was a veteran of minor league baseball who appeared in 26 games over parts of three Major League seasons as a middle-relief pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers () and Baltimore Orioles (–). He also spent all but two seasons of his coaching career in the minors; the exceptions came in and when he was the big-league pitching coach of the Orioles under managers Joe Altobelli and Earl Weaver.\nRowe batted and threw right-handed and was listed as tall and . He signed with his hometown Detroit Tigers in 1953 and bounced among five Detroit farm teams in the lower minors until November 1955, when he was drafted by the Dodgers, still in Brooklyn. He became a relief pitcher in 1962 with the Spokane Indians, appearing in 70 games, and then received his first MLB trial with the 1963 Dodgers. After a six-game, early season stint in Los Angeles, which netted Rowe his only MLB save (May 7 against the St. Louis Cardinals), he returned to Spokane until late July when the Dodgers recalled him. He then appeared in eight more games during the year's final three months, as the Dodgers successfully fended off the Cardinals to win the National League championship. He won his first MLB game September 26 with three innings of shutout relief against the New York Mets, but did not appear in the 1963 World Series, won by the Dodgers in a four-game sweep over the New York Yankees.\nIn , Rowe found himself back in Spokane, where he worked in 88 games, all in relief, and posted a 16–11 record and sparkling 1.77 earned run average in 137 innings pitched. The performance impressed the Orioles, who were locked in a three-way struggle with the Yankees and Chicago White Sox for the American League pennant. They purchased Rowe's contract from Spokane September 10 and, four days later, called upon Rowe to take over for starting pitcher Milt Pappas in the ninth inning of a 3–3 tie at Memorial Stadium against the Minnesota Twins. Rowe retired the Twins in order and then was credited with the victory when the Orioles pushed across the winning run in the home half of the ninth. Rowe worked in five more games for Baltimore and was effective until his final two outings, as the Orioles finished third, only two games behind the Yankees.\nHe then made six early-season appearances for the 1965 Orioles before returning to the minors for the rest of his active career. In his brief MLB career, Rowe posted a 2–1 record with a 3.21 ERA and one save in 26 games pitched, including nine games finished, 19 strikeouts, 14 walks, and innings. He allowed 55 hits.\nHis acquisition by Baltimore in late 1964 marked a long association with the Orioles, whom he served as a minor league manager, pitching coach and pitching coordinator, and MLB pitching coach through 1986. After working in the Yankees' and Philadelphia Phillies' systems, he joined the Cleveland Indians in 1991 as a minor league pitching coach, working with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons and the Short-season Mahoning Valley Scrappers, among other assignments, for 22 seasons until his death in 2012."

Paolo Bettini's consistency through the season, however, saw the rider from Quick-Step–Davitamon overhaul Rebellin to claim his third consecutive World Cup crown and the outright record for competition victories. Bettini's excellent form in August had much input into the final standings: three second places in the three races gave Bettini 210 points compared to the 112 points Rebellin accumulated in this time placing Bettini just 6 points behind in second place.

        "text": "The 2007 NCAA Division I baseball tournament was held from June 1 to 24, . Sixty-four NCAA Division I college baseball teams advanced to the post season tournament after having played through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament.\nThe 2007 tournament culminated with 8 teams advancing to the College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, on June 15. Unseeded Oregon State repeated as national champions, winning all five of its games in the 2007 CWS.\nOregon State went undefeated through the College World Series, posting a 5–0 record. The Beavers, led by head coach Pat Casey, won all three games in their four-team bracket and then, for the second straight season, defeated North Carolina in the best-of-three championship series— this time in two games. Oregon State became the fifth team to win consecutive NCAA titles (last done by LSU in 1996-97), and were the first team to win four games in a CWS by six or more runs. As of 2019, 2007 Oregon State remains the only team to have ever won at least four games by six or more runs in the same College World Series. Their opener against Cal State Fullerton was a tight 3–2 victory, but OSU's last four games in the CWS were not close, impressive for a team seeded in the lower half of the 64-team tournament.\nThe Beavers also became the first team to win the CWS after having posted a losing conference record. Oregon State was a disappointing 10–14 (.417) in the Pac-10, placing sixth among the nine baseball-playing schools (Oregon dropped baseball in 1981, but revived it in 2009.)\nHowever, the Beavers' non-conference record during the regular season was an impressive 28–3 (.903), and as defending NCAA champions, just enough to gain a berth in the 64-team tournament. They were placed as a No. 3 seed in one of the 16 four-team regionals, in Charlottesville, Virginia. Oregon State responded by going 11–1 (.917) in the post season. Oregon State won their final 10 games to finish at 49–18 (.731) overall. The Beavers trailed in only one inning of 2007 CWS: the first inning of the final game. Their only loss in the post season came during the second game of regionals, where they fell in 13 innings to host Virginia.\nOregon State freshman pitcher Jorge Reyes (of Warden, Washington) was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2007 CWS. Reyes was 2–0 as a starter, defeating Cal State Fullerton in the opener and North Carolina in the first game of the finals.\nTwo elite programs from Louisiana, LSU and Tulane both failed to qualify for the field of 64, marking the first time since 1984 both schools stayed home. LSU reached the College World Series 13 times between 1986 and 2004, winning five national championships (1991, 1993, 1996, 1997, 2000), while Tulane made trips to the CWS in 2001 and 2005.\nBids.\nAutomatic bids.\nConference champions from 30 Division I conferences earned automatic bids to regionals.

        "text": "James Scott Hunter (born November 19, 1947) is a former professional football player, a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons in the 1970s. He played for the Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Falcons, and Detroit Lions.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Mobile, Alabama, Hunter graduated from Vigor High School in Prichard. After his senior season, Hunter was named AAAA All-Alabama by the Associated Press. He committed to Alabama on December 4, 1965.\nCollege career.\nAs NCAA rules prohibited freshmen from playing on varsity football teams at the time, Hunter played on the freshman-only Crimson Tide in 1966. He took a redshirt season in 1967, but became the starter in 1968. In 1969, Alabama hosted the Ole Miss Rebels in a nationally televised game on October 4 in prime time for ABC. In a race of offenses, Hunter outgunned Rebel quarterback Archie Manning in a 33-32 win. At the end of his senior year in 1970, Hunter caught a go-ahead touchdown in the 1970 Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl en route to a tie with Oklahoma.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nHunter was selected in the sixth round of the 1971 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers, the 140th overall pick. He started ten games when starting quarterback Bart Starr was injured. Hunter started the entire 1972 season and led the Packers to their first division title and playoff appearance since 1967 under the tutelage of Starr, who served that season as quarterbacks coach. In 1973, Hunter played only a fraction of the time, embroiled in a quarterback competition with Jerry Tagge and Jim Del Gaizo.\nBuffalo Bills.\nAfter signing a multi-year deal with the Packers in May 1974, Hunter was traded in July to the Buffalo Bills after participating in the 1974 NFL strike. The Bills sent Pete Van Valkenberg and Steve Okoniewski to the Packers in the trade. Playing as backup to Joe Ferguson, Hunter made only one appearance all year, helping the team to a win against the Atlanta Falcons on October 16. He was waived during the 1975 training camp and did not play in the NFL that season, instead running unsuccessfully for local government in Mobile.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nHunter landed with the Atlanta Falcons in 1976, starting the season on the bench and gaining playing time as the season went on. Hunter started seven games in 1977, until starter Steve Bartkowski returned from knee surgery and took over as the full-time starter. Hunter was released after the season, and did not play in the NFL in 1978.\nDetroit Lions.\nHunter's last season in the NFL was 1979 with the Detroit Lions, where he backed up Jeff Komlo but still saw some action when the rookie struggled and occasionally challenged for the starting job.\nAfter football.\nHunter returned to Alabama and worked as a sportscaster in Mobile for nearly two decades. He worked for WKRG-TV, the CBS affiliate, and then for WPMI-TV, the NBC affiliate. He then worked as an investment broker.\nHe also co-hosts a seasonal radio show on WNSP 105.5 FM called \"Talkin' Football\" (pronounced Tawlkin-Football) with former Auburn lineman, Tracy Turner and legendary WNSP personality, Dave Schultz. Scott remains great friends with Archie Manning to this day and the two have extracontinental text conversations when Archie is in Europe. Hunter is known for \"dropping it in the bucket\" and being one of five Alabama quarterbacks (Blake Sims, Tua Tagovailoa, Mac Jones, and Bryce Young) to throw for 400 yards in a game. Hunter is famous for \"Keeping It Between the Lines\" and not allowing coaching hot seat talk or \"who danced with who on Saturday night\" to derail conversations.\nPrior to its closure, \"Talkin' Football\" was frequently hosted from John Word's Captain's Table, which was in the shadow of the USS \"Alabama\". Hunter would often say that their steaks were \"so big that they hang off your plate\".\nHunter is also a commercial pilot with over 4,000 flying hours. He flies a Cessna 182.\nHunter was inducted in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He is married with three children, and resided in Daphne, Alabama in the late 2000s. He had previously lived in De Pere, Wisconsin when he played with the Packers."

It can also enable very large concrete structures to be constructed in one single pour (which may take days or weeks as the formwork rises with the process), thus creating seamless structures with enhanced strength and visual appearance, as well as reducing construction times and material costs (at the joints which would otherwise require extra reinforcement / connectors). An advantage of guided climbing systems is that they remain connected to the building during the lifting process.\nThe climbing formwork structure normally does not only contain the formwork itself, but also usually provides working space / scaffolds for construction crews. It may also provide areas for machinery and screens for weather protection, up to being fully enclosed while yet staying modular around a changing building structure."

        "title": "Bowling form",
        "text": "In the sport of ten-pin bowling, there are many different ways in which to deliver (known as a \"throw\" or \"roll\") the bowling ball in order to advance it toward the pins in an accurate and powerful manner. Generally, there are three basic forms of 10-pin bowling. The most basic form is known as stroking, which is the most classic form. The most powerful form is known as cranking, which imparts great leverage and maximum rotation on the ball, but sacrifices accuracy. In between the two is the domain of the tweener, who has characteristics of both, but does not truly fit into either category. A well-known variant of \"tweening\" is the power stroker.\nPower stroking is often very similar to cranking and bowlers can often fit in either category, therefore bowlers that use one of these two styles are often simply known as power players. A fourth style, known as helicopter, spinning, or UFO, is a style that is used to great effect in Asia. Finally, many modern bowlers have changed to a one- or two-handed no-thumb delivery. Most of the various forms use different wrist and hand positions and rely on different timings and body positions to accommodate the differences in each style of release.\nConventional bowling form.\nA conventional bowling form is the most commonly used method in 10-pin bowling. There are many styles that can be used in a conventional bowling form. However, all of the styles have one thing in common: the method in which to achieve a strike.\nThe following describes a strike for a right-handed bowler. A strike in conventional bowling is a specific method of knocking down all of the pins on the first ball. A conventional strike is when the ball utilizes the one-three pocket. A \"pocket\" is the area fronting the one and three pins.\nThere are countless ways a bowler can achieve a strike. However, the goal for a bowler on every first ball is to achieve a strike using the method that generates the highest strike percentage. A \"perfect strike\" is a strike where the ball hits only four pins: the one, three, five and nine pins. The ball enters the one-three pocket, and then falls into the pit area to the right of where the eight pin previously stood.\nStroking.\nA stroker is a type of player in ten-pin bowling who releases his or her bowling ball in a smooth manner. They typically have rev rates less than 300 rpm. Strokers often keep their shoulders square to the foul line and their backswing generally does not go much above parallel to the ground. This type of release reduces the ball's rate of revolution, thus decreasing its hook potential and hitting power. Strokers rely on finesse and accuracy, as opposed to crankers, who use speed and power. However, today's modern reactive resin bowling balls now allow strokers to hit the \"pocket\" at a relatively high angle. Stroking is considered the most classic of all the bowling forms and is still the most popular style of bowling in the PBA.\nAlthough crankers are often considered to be more impressive to watch, strokers are often considered to have more repeatable and accurate shots. Strokers rely on smooth ball placement more than kinetic energy to fell pins. The all-time leader in titles and bowling earnings in the United States, Walter Ray Williams, Jr., is a stroker (though some consider his style unique and not easily classifiable). Other famous strokers include PBA Hall of Famers Norm Duke, David Ozio, and Dick Weber.\nSeveral high-profile left-handed bowlers, such as Hall of Famers Earl Anthony, Mike Aulby, Parker Bohn III and Mike Scroggins have used a stroker release, which has led to a stereotype in the bowling community that most left-handers are strokers who can only play the outside part of the lane. Part of this is due to the fact that the left side of the lane tends to have more oil due to less activity, forcing players to the outside of the lane to find friction.\nTweening.\nA tweener (a term derived from \"in-between\") is a bowler who delivers the ball in a manner that falls somewhere in between stroking and cranking. They have rev rates between 300 and 370 rpm. This modified delivery could use a higher backswing than is normally employed by a pure stroker or a less powerful wrist position than a pure cranker. Some use the term to refer to a bowler who is simply not a \"picture perfect\" example of either a stroker or a cranker.\nNotable tweeners include Brian Voss (primarily a stroker, but not \"picture perfect\"), Mika Koivuniemi (primarily a stroker, but with a high backswing), and Doug Kent (considered by some to be a power stroker).\nPower stroking.\nA variation on tweening is used by a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. Weber's release imparts a high degree of axis rotation and very little axis tilt. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing like a cranker would. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Dick Allen, Dominic Barrett, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).\nCranking/power player.\nA cranker or power player is a bowler who strives to generate revolutions using a cupped wrist or excessive wrist action. They have typically have revolution rates over 400 rpm. Crankers who rely on wrist action may have a high backswing and open their shoulders to generate ball speed. These bowlers often cup the wrist, but open the wrist at the top of the swing. Mark Roth was among the first bowlers to crank the ball using a high backswing and excessive wrist action. Crankers may also muscle the ball with a bent elbow because their wrist is not strong enough to be cupped at the release. Crankers often use \"late\" timing, where the foot gets to the foul line before the ball; a technique known as plant and pull, hardly using any slide on their final step and pulling the ball upwards for leverage. The timing between the feet and the ball being delivered is only a fraction of a second. Even though the plant and pull bowler is sometimes used as another name for a cranker, it is rather misleading because some crankers slide more, while bowlers with other styles can also use this technique.\nThe term \"cranking\" is used to describe the style of release and heavy wrist action that typifies crankers. Because of the high rev rate and power crankers have, they can throw powerful strikes even on less-than-perfect hits, but are more prone to splits rarely left by strokers or otherwise. The myth that crankers are not good spare shooters is not always supported. Roth, for example, was one of the best spare shooters on tour in his day, and was the first person to convert the nearly-impossible 7-10 split on national television. Robert Smith and Jason Couch also both posted very high spare-conversion percentages. Due to the intensive nature of their release, cranking is sometimes viewed as physically detrimental long-term such that some bowlers transition to a tweener/power stroker release. Because many bowlers have a style that can be described as a cranker or a power stroker, the term \"power player\" is used for any bowler who can generate high revolutions or ball speed.\nCrankers sometimes stand to the extreme opposite side of the approach (relative to their target), and roll the ball over the middle lane boards out toward the gutter, using high revolutions to hook the ball back toward the pocket; this line is called \"deep inside\", \"coast to coast\", or \"hooking the whole lane\". Depending on the bowling ball, lane condition and bowler, the ball may exhibit either a rounded hook pattern or a later, more severe hook pattern known as skid-snap or skid-flip.\nSome crankers use a low backswing but have a cupped wrist in order to generate high revolutions; this was the \"old-fashioned\" way of cranking. Notable bowlers with such a style include Jim Godman, Bob Learn, Jr., Ryan Shafer, Kelly Coffman, and Bob Vespi. Older commentary have also referred to such crankers as \"twisters\". Other bowlers who followed Roth's style of a cupped wrist and high backswing include Amleto Monacelli, Jason Couch and, more recently, E. J. Tackett. Bowlers like Robert Smith, Mike Fagan, and Tommy Jones are often considered crankers due to their high backswings and RPM rates, but each has a smooth release and slide, so they can also be classified as power strokers.\nBall speed.\nBowling ball delivery speed is affected primarily by three factors: gravity, the bowler's forward speed, and downswing acceleration. A longer arm or higher backswing height increases the speed that gravity produces. Forward momentum is also imparted to the ball by the bowler's walking speed. Finally, deliberate forward acceleration of the arm during the downswing affects delivery speed.\nSpinning.\nSpinners use a style of release known variously as spinning, helicopter, or UFO. Regardless of what it's known as, a spinner releases a ball such that it is rotating around the vertical axis in a counter clockwise motion (right-hander, and viewed from above) as it moves down the lane. A spinner generates around 90 degrees of axis tilt and virtually no axis (side) rotation. Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the pin rack, and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown in one of the three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane. A hook needs friction, in order to allow the ball to \"grab\" the lane. In spinning, very little of the ball's surface touches the lane, which is what the spinner intends. Spinning does not require friction of any kind, though due to the hand position at release, most spinners exhibit a slight backup hook relative to their bowling hand.\nThe objective in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than \"carry\" (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes the right side of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as \"riding the rail\" among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball, though any hook on the ball tends to be unintentional. As the ball moves down the row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as \"mixing\"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.\nBecause spinners do not want the ball to grab onto the lane with its surface, they often use \"plastic\" bowling balls - balls with the older polyester cover-stock popular in the 1970s and 1980s, and commonly used as house balls today - in comparison to the widely used polyurethane, \"particle\" (polyurethane with nigh-microscopic glass spheres or other hard material throughout the coverstock) and \"reactive resin\" balls (\"reactive resin\" is itself polyurethane manufactured using a process to leave microscopic pores throughout it, essentially, a hard sponge) used by bowlers who desire a ball that will grip the lane and roll strongly. Additionally, because the chances of injury are somewhat elevated with this style of bowling, as well as the advantage of ball deflection with this style, the spinner will have a tendency to use lightweight balls between ten and twelve pounds.\nSome hook bowlers can also spin and roll the ball at the same time, keeping the ball in-between the X and Y axis. Such a release may impart more ball deflection and pin action, but may also lead the ball to react later with less hook, unless it is drilled in a configuration to compensate for the additional axis tilt. Tom Baker, Wayne Garber, and Ryan Shafer of the PBA Tour, and Miki Nishimura of the JPBA exhibit higher axis tilt than most hook bowlers.\nIn tournaments within countries like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning can be an advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the foul line to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.\nOther bowling forms.\nNo-thumb delivery.\nA no-thumb delivery involves inserting only two fingers into the bowling ball, leaving the thumb on the outside of the ball, in an effort to create more revolutions and greater hook. Due to similar ball roll and revolutions to the cranker style, it is sometimes considered a variation of cranking. As the bowler does not use the opposite hand to support the ball (as in the two-handed approach), the wrist is often severely cupped and/or the ball is balanced on the forearm and delivered using a bent elbow throughout the shot. Another variation of this delivery is to palm the ball forcing the thumb to the side of the ball while forcing the elbow to lock so as to keep the arm straight and generate a back-swing. This variation leads to far greater consistency and straightens the ball out when needed. All styles of no-thumbing usually require bowlers to use bowling balls that are generally one to three pounds lighter than their thumb-in counterparts.\nThis technique is often used by casual or league-level bowlers who have not learned how to hook the ball using one of the more standard, thumb-in grips. It is also prevalent among left-handed bowlers using house balls. A left-handed bowler would have to reverse the ball in order to properly use the holes typically drilled for right-handed bowlers. Notable bowlers to use this technique at the professional level include Mike Miller and Tom Daugherty.\nHalf-thumb variation.\nThe half-thumb variation is a technique employed by Tom Smallwood, the surprise winner of the 2009 \"PBA World Championship\", and involves putting the thumb in the ball only up to the first knuckle. Thus, the ball is thrown almost entirely with the fingers as a \"no thumb\" bowler would throw it, with the thumb only providing some control during the backswing. Smallwood also keeps two hands on the bowling ball until roughly midway through his approach.\nTwo-handed approach.\nA two-handed approach is a bowling technique whereupon the throwing hand is in the bowling ball and the opposite hand is also placed on the ball during the shot. This is an evolution of the one-handed no-thumb technique, where a bowler would generate similar revolutions but could not be as effective because their opposite hand does not support the ball through the approach.\nTraditionally, in two handed bowling, two fingers are inserted into the ball with the thumb left out. The dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the opposite hand is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion, with the ball delivered shovel-style. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate their hips more than a single handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 600 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what some top professional bowlers generate.\nThe two-handed approach should not be confused with the two-handed delivery. Just prior to the release of the ball, a bowler using a two-handed \"approach\" removes their supporting hand, effectively delivering the ball with only one hand. They are considered a one-handed bowler by governing bodies, and must follow appropriate rules regarding switching dominant hands during competition. An actual two-handed \"delivery\" involves using both hands simultaneously to give force to the ball and is extremely rare in adult competition; it is mostly seen with young children first learning the game.'\nAustralian Jason Belmonte, the all-time leader in PBA major championships, was among the first bowlers to gain worldwide recognition for using the two-handed approach style. Others that followed include Finn Osku Palermaa, Swede Jesper Svensson, and Americans Kyle Troup and Anthony Simonsen. American Chaz Dennis, who as a 10-year-old became the second-youngest person ever to bowl a 300 game, also uses this technique. The bowling team of Bolivia is also noted for changing its bowlers to using the two-handed approach style.\nWhile used by just a handful of veteran professional players, this style is becoming popular with young bowlers. A \"Bowlers Journal International\" article in 2018 states that 21% of the junior bowlers at the recently completed USBC Junior Gold Championships used the two-handed approach style. This includes 25% of bowlers in the U12 category (ages 12 and under), 24% of U15 bowlers, and 19% of U20 bowlers.\nFull roller.\nFull roller is a style of bowling that traces its origins to the earliest days of bowling. Many top champions of the past were full rollers such as Ned Day and Billy Hardwick.\nThere are also some modern full rollers such as Dave Ewald and Tom Smallwood. A full roller rolls the ball in such a way that the ball tracks over its full circumference, thus the name \"full\" roller. In addition to a full circumference ball track, the ball track itself crosses between the fingers and thumb through the palm in a diagonal path. A full roller release can be very straight such as Billy Hardwick rolled, or have up to a 90 degree or greater axis of rotation such as Tom Smallwood rolls. Usually a suitcase style grip with the thumb in the 9 o'clock position and the fingers in the 3 o'clock position (for a right hander) at the moment of release will create a full roller track. As the hand comes forward the thumb exits first, and the fingers still at 3 o'clock, lift up through the ball, causing it to rotate off the fingers to the left, creating side rotation and a horizontal track through the palm center of the ball."

He played professional basketball in Poland, Spain, Israel, South Korea, France, Germany, and Turkey. He was murdered in 2015.\nHigh school career.\nWright played his high school basketball at Farragut Academy, where, as a freshman, he was part of one of the best teams in the country, which boasted future professionals Willie Farley and Ronnie Fields, as well as Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Kevin Garnett. At 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in), Wright played center after Garnett's departure, and moved to power forward in college.\nCollege career.\nAt the University of Arizona, Wright started for the Wildcats in the 2001 NCAA Division I championship against the Duke Blue Devils. However, undersized for that position at the pro level, and too slow to be a small forward,he dropped to the second round of the 2001 NBA draft where he was drafted by the New York Knicks.\nProfessional career.\nWright was drafted as the 39th pick in the 2001 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. After not joining the Knicks or any other NBA team, Wright moved overseas and switched teams almost every season. He was one of 8 players selected in the 2001 NBA Draft who never played in a single NBA game.\nWright started with Polish league champions Śląsk Wrocław, that also participated in the Euroleague, moving to Spain's CB Granada the following year.\nAfter the team was relegated to the LEB (Spain's second division), Wright moved to Israel and signed with Hapoel Tel Aviv. A year later he signed with ALBA Berlin.\nIn 2005, he moved to Beşiktaş Cola Turka of the Turkish Basketball League. He started the 2006–07 season in South Korea with Jeonju KCC Egis; in October signed with French and Euroleague's EB Pau Orthez.\nIn May 2007, he moved back to Turkey and signed for Türk Telekom B.K. In September 2009 he has signed a contract with Turów Zgorzelec from Poland for the 2009–10 season.\nIn July 2011, he returned to Türk Telekom B.K. for one season with an option for a second one. In the summer of 2012, he signed a contract with Mersin BB.\nOn February 3, 2015, he signed with Cholet Basket of the French LNB Pro A. After averaging 1.7 points and 2 rebounds in 3 contests, Wright and Cholet parted ways.\nMurder.\nOn November 10, 2015, Wright was found dead in his car in Brooklyn, New York, covered in trash bags in the vehicle's back seat. The medical examiner determined that his death was a homicide. Two men were charged in his death.\nAccording to a family member interviewed after his death, Wright intended to return to Europe to play another two seasons before retirement.\nTwo men were charged on November 1, 2016 – Mark A. Holdbrooks, 59, and alleged accomplice David Victor, 35, were charged with murder and other offenses after a yearlong investigation. Holdbrooks, Wright's longtime roommate, allegedly reported him missing on November 8, 2015. Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal did not specify a motive or mention how Wright was killed but said he had suffered \"head trauma.\" Later, authorities said Victor and Holdbrooks drugged Wright with gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a date rape drug, and killed him with an axe in Closter, New Jersey, and that Victor then drove Wright's Lexus SUV to Brooklyn, leaving it with his body in it parked on East 16th Street near Avenue J in Midwood."

        "text": "The 2007 New Zealand rugby league season was the 100th season of rugby league that had been played in New Zealand. The main feature of the year was the eighth season of the Bartercard Cup competition that was run by the New Zealand Rugby League. The Auckland Lions won the Cup by defeating Harbour League 28-4 in the Grand Final.\nInternational competitions.\nThe New Zealand national rugby league team played one test match in New Zealand, losing to Australia. They then embarked on the 2007 All Golds Tour to celebrate the centenary of international rugby league. The touring squad was coached by Gary Kemble and included: Louis Anderson, captain Roy Asotasi, Luke Covell, Greg Eastwood, David Faiumu, Dene Halatau, Shontayne Hape, Lance Hohaia, Krisnan Inu, Shaun Kenny-Dowall, Epalahame Lauaki, Thomas Leuluai, Jeff Lima, Simon Mannering, Steve Matai, Fuifui Moimoi, Sam Perrett, Frank Pritchard, Sam Rapira, Ben Roberts, Jeremy Smith, Jeremy Smith, Chase Stanley, Clinton Toopi, Taniela Tuiaki, Tame Tupou and Paul Whatuira. In addition Nigel Vagana, Clinton Toopi, Stacey Jones, Ruben Wiki, Steve Price, Ali Lauitiiti, David Kidwell, Jason Cayless and Awen Guttenbeil played for the All Golds in a celebration match. Wayne Bennett coached the All Golds side.\nEarlier in the year the Kiwis had lost the ANZAC Test 6-30. Jake Webster, Manu Vatuvei, Benji Marshall, Nathan Cayless, Sonny Bill Williams, Tony Puletua, David Fa'alogo and Iosia Soliola played in the ANZAC Test but did not tour at the end of the year.\nThe amateur Irish Wolfhounds toured New Zealand in May–June, defeating Bay of Plenty but losing to Whangarei Marists and Auckland Marists. They were coached by ex-pat Tony Benson.\nNational competitions.\nRugby League Cup.\nThe Hawke's Bay defeated Gisborne Tairawhiti 58-6 on 15 September 2007. Canterbury B then defeated the Hawke's Bay to win the Rugby League Cup. The Hawke's Bay Unicorns included Elijah Niko.\nBartercard Cup.\nThe 2007 season was the eighth and final season of the Bartercard Cup run by the New Zealand Rugby League. From 2008 onwards the NZRL was to revert to a more traditional provincial competition.\nThere were no major team changes however the Tamaki Leopards were renamed the Tamaki Titans and the Auckland Lions also fielded a team in the NSWRL Premier League. As a result, less players from the New Zealand Warriors featured in the Bartercard Cup.\nA Saturday double header took place each weekend with one game screened live on Māori Television and the other one delayed on a Sunday. This replaced 2006's Monday Night Football, a move welcomed by Canterbury Bulls head coach Brent Stuart. The double header was held at either Mt Smart Stadium or North Harbour Stadium each weekend. There was only one Split Round (Round Eight over Queens Birthday Weekend) which meant the Grand Final was played in September.\nThe playoffs.\nThe Bartercard Cup used the Page–McIntyre system in 2007. In the major semi-final at Waitemata Stadium, between the Auckland Lions and Harbour League the scores were tied at 40 all after normal time and 2 further periods of extra time. The game proceeded to go on for another 17 minutes and 16 seconds before Auckland finally scored the winning try. NZRL management believed that no game of rugby league has ever lasted that long, or at least certainly in modern times. This record was broken by the 2014 Group 21 Rugby League Grand Final between Scone and Denman, which lasted 125 minutes.\nProvincial tour.\nAuckland conducted a Queen's Birthday weekend tour of the South Island. The team was coached by Sam Panapa. The team defeated a West Coast Invitational XIII 26-20 and Canterbury 28-24.\nSouth Island Zone Competition.\nThe Southland Rams, Canterbury B, West Coast and Otago played a four team tournament in September and October.\nNational Club Competition.\nThe Wainuiomata Lions defeated the Papakura Sea Eagles 48-26 in the Grand Final of the National Club Competition. Wainuiomata defeated Manurewa 40-18 in a semi final while Papakura defeated Kaiapoi 48-22.\nAustralian competitions.\nThe New Zealand Warriors competed in the National Rugby League competition. They finished 4th out of 16 teams before losing to North Queensland in the Semi-finals.\nThe Auckland Lions competed in the NSWRL Premier League and finished 10th out of 13 teams.\nClub competitions.\nAuckland.\nThe Manurewa Marlins won the Fox Memorial trophy, defeating the Papakura Sea Eagles 28-20 in extra time in the grand final. Papakura had finished the season as minor premiers. Richmond won the Stormont Shield.\nThe Northcote Tigers won the Sharman Cup (Division Two) while Ponsonby won the Phelan Shield (Division Three).\nWellington.\nThe Wainuiomata Lions were coached by John Lomax. David Lomax stepped in as caretaker coach when his brother was unavailable.\nThe Wellington Rugby League board was given full control of its own competition on 1 April after being \"in review\" by the New Zealand Rugby League since January 2003.\nCanterbury.\nKaiapoi won the Canterbury Rugby League title.\nOther Competitions.\nThe Taniwharau Rugby League Club were the Waicoa Bay minor premiers and went on to win the grand final, defeating Turangawaewae. Taniwharau went through the season undefeated.\nThe Kia Ora Warriors defeated the Waitara Bears 29-20 in the Western Alliance grand final."

For the first time, the competition was split into two zones: the America Zone and the Europe Zone. This change was necessitated by having more than 16 teams compete for the cup (thus not fitting into one easily workable draw). The past several years had also seen a rise in the number of defaults, as teams from around the globe tried to work out the logistics of playing such an international tournament. Regional zones would help alleviate these problems.\nThe Europe Zone consisted of 13 teams, while the America Zone was made up of 4 teams. Hawaii competed for the first and only time. The winners of the Zones met in an Inter-Zonal play-off, with the winner challenging defending champions the United States for the championship.\nAustralia defeated France in the Inter-Zonal play-off, but again lost to the United States in the Challenge Round. The final was played at the West Side Tennis Club in New York City on 31 August – 3 September.\nAmerica Zone.\nFinal.\nAustralia vs. Japan\nEurope Zone.\nFinal.\nFrance vs. Spain\nInter-Zonal Final.\nAustralia vs. France\nChallenge Round.\nUnited States vs. Australia"

        "text": "Golf Mill Shopping Center, or simply Golf Mill, is a shopping center located at 239 Golf Mill Center in Niles, Illinois. The shopping mall has a gross leasable area of . It is managed by Sterling Retail Services. It borders the intersections of Golf Road (Illinois Route 58), Milwaukee Avenue (Illinois Route 21) and Greenwood Avenue. The shopping mall has over 100 specialty shops, three anchor stores (JCPenney, Target, and Ross Dress for Less), an AMC Theatres, a grocery store (Gordon Food Service), an XSport Fitness gym, and a 9-story office tower and other outparcels. Former anchors included Sears and Roebuck (closed December 2018), and Kohl's (closed Halloween 2020).\nHistory.\nGolf Mill opened to the public in October 1960 as an open-air mall and featured an office tower (designed by Chicago architect Edo Belli to look like the top of a golf ball) and Sears. It featured a full \"mill\" theme, complete with ponds, bridges, and a working waterwheel. Soon after opening, a Lord's department store was built, but closed after a few years and was replaced by JCPenney. Around that time, the Mill Run Playhouse was built at the north end of the complex that wasn't connected to the corridors.\nGeneral Growth Properties took over the management of the Golf Mill Shopping Center in 1994.\nAfter General Growth Properties went bankrupt, Milwaukee Golf Management Corporation took over the management of the Golf Mill Shopping Center in 2009. Sterling Organization purchased Golf Mill Shopping Center in August 2014 via a private equity fund, and its subsidiary, Sterling Retail Services is currently managing the property on behalf of the fund.\nStore Openings.\nIn 1989, MainStreet was acquired by Kohl's. \nOn October 11, 1998, a Target opened in the north wing across from Kohl's.\nIn 2005, Value City Furniture opened, replacing some inline stores and an entrance. \nIn 2010, Kerasotes ShowPlace 12 was acquired by AMC. \nCircuit City which opened in 1990 and located outside the mall closed in the mid-2000s. It was later replaced with a Lucky McGee's sports bar. It closed in January 2016.\nGordon Food Service opened outside of the mall to customers on October 18, 2011, located on the south section of the parking lot near JCPenney.\nRoss Dress for Less opened in 2012, replacing a dead section of the mall.\nThe mall added a Panera Bread across the main entrance in early 2017. \nUlta Beauty opened in November 2017, replacing the south section of the food court.\nOn October 4, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 12 stores nationwide. The store closed in December 2018.\nA Chase Bank has been built next to the Panera Bread and opened to the public August 2020. The mall has also built a Chick-fil-A restaurant on the northwest corner of the parking lot, which opened on October 12, 2021.\nOn August 21, 2020, Kohl's announced that they will permanently close their store at Golf Mill to relocate to a brand new shopping center in Morton Grove, Illinois, called Sawmill Station. The store officially closed on Halloween 2020. A Burlington store opened on October 29, 2021, in the first floor of the former space.\nIn January 2022, the mall announced that it will be redeveloping most of the mall, planning to demolish the former Sears, AMC, Iconic Circular Tower, and various outlots as part of a \"live work play\" styled development. The new development would bring back the water wheel, add new outdoor retail, apartment complexes, new greenspace.\nRenovations.\nIn 1986, the mall had major renovations, with the north end being completely rebuilt as an enclosed portion anchored by MainStreet and enclosing the mall between the Sears and JCPenney, also adding a food court in the process. \nIn 2006, GGP remodeled the mall complete with new flooring and a new food court entrance, however the north wing and a corridor in the south wing were left untouched. The remodel also added a 12-screen Kerasotes movie theater.\nWhen Ulta first opened in 2017, the mall has planned to relocate the former south food court next to AMC, but it was scrapped.\nIn January 2022, the mall announced that it will be redeveloping most of the mall, planning to demolish the former Sears, AMC, Iconic Circular Tower, and various outlots as part of a \"live work play\" styled development. The new development would bring back the water wheel, add new outdoor retail, apartment complexes, new greenspace. JCPenney, Ulta Beauty, Chick-fil-A, Panera, Chase, X-Sport Fitness, Burlington, Target, and other stores will remain. \nBus routes.\nPace"

He took Villanova to the 1971 NCAA Championship Game, in which Villanova lost to UCLA 68–62. Porter was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player after scoring 25 points in the final game. However, he was later ruled ineligible for the honor because he had signed a professional contract with the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association during the middle of his senior year.

        "text": "Winfield Scott Hastings (August 10, 1847 – August 14, 1907) was a Major League Baseball player and manager in the late 19th century. Primarily a catcher and outfielder, Hastings also appeared as a first baseman, second baseman, and shortstop over the course of his career.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nHastings was born in Hillsboro, Ohio, the son of a wagon maker. He was named after U.S. Army General Winfield Scott. Hastings enlisted in the 145th Illinois Infantry Regiment in 1864 at 18 years old. He was a member of the Rockford Forest Citys in , when he led amateur players in runs, hits, and scoring average, and he served as the Forest Citys team captain in 1869 and . Hastings is listed in the 1870 census working as a hotel clerk in Rockford.\nProfessional career.\nRockford Forest Citys (1871).\nPrior to joining the 1871 Forest Citys, Hastings played for the independent Lone Star club of New Orleans, including in an exhibition game on April 16, against the Chicago White Stockings. He made his major league debut with the Forest Citys on May 6, in the process violating a league rule which disallowed players from playing for National Association teams within 60 days of leaving their previous club. After the season, Rockford's four wins during that period, including a June 15 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics that came just a day before Hastings would have been eligible to play, were changed to forfeit losses. This dropped the team's record, and Hastings' managerial record, from 8–17 to 4–21. Since two of Rockford's four forfeits came against the league champion Athletics, who finished just two games in front of the Boston Red Stockings, Hastings had an outsize impact on the 1871 pennant race. In terms of personal statistics, he had 30 hits, including six doubles and four triples, in 118 at bats for an \"unspectacular\" .254 batting average, along with 27 runs scored, 20 RBI, and 11 stolen bases.\nCleveland Forest Citys (1872).\nAfter the Rockford Forest Citys disbanded at the end of 1871, Hastings joined the Cleveland Forest Citys in , again as player-manager. However, he lost the job of manager to Deacon White after the team played poorly, especially defensively, on an abortive eastern road trip in May. Rotating between catcher, second base and the outfield, Hastings was batting .391 when the Forest Citys folded on August 19. He and Jim Holdsworth were the only two Cleveland players who were signed by other teams for the remainder of the season.\nBaltimore Canaries (1872–1873).\nHastings moved to the Baltimore Canaries to finish out the 1872 season, where he primarily caught, and hit .306. His .362 batting average for the entire season was Hastings' career high.\nHastings remained with the Canaries for the season, and batted .281 while rotating with two other players (Cal McVey and Bill Craver) at the catching position, as well as filling in as a fourth outfielder. In one October victory over the Brooklyn Atlantics, he tallied six hits and scored seven runs.\nHartford Dark Blues (1874).\nThe Hartford Dark Blues signed Hastings in advance of the season, in part due to his familiarity with pitcher Cherokee Fisher. For the Dark Blues, Hastings once again split time at catcher and played mainly in the outfield when not behind the plate. He recorded 80 hits, including 11 doubles, in 247 at bats for a .325 batting average, and led the team in runs scored with 60.\nChicago White Stockings (1875).\nHastings changed teams again for , joining the Chicago White Stockings after a tryout during which he demonstrated he could catch the fastball of Jim Devlin. He played an important role in a 1-0 extra inning victory over his former club Hartford on June 19, first making a running catch in right field with the bases loaded in the top of the eighth inning, then hitting a leadoff single in the bottom of the 11th which led to the game winning run. Although Hastings was eliminated on a fielder's choice groundout by Devlin, Hartford pitcher Candy Cummings stated that the subsequent throw to first hit Hastings, which caused it to go into the stands and allowed Devlin to get to third base, from which he eventually scored.\nHastings was the regular catcher for Chicago, but his average fell to .254, and although he stole 13 bases, he led the league with 11 times caught stealing. After the season, White Stockings owner William Hulbert found Hastings expendable, and signed his former teammate Deacon White from the Boston Red Stockings to replace him.\nLouisville Grays (1876).\nHastings caught on with the Louisville Grays for the season in the new National League. He transitioned from primarily playing catcher to being the everyday center fielder for the Grays. Hastings posted a .258 batting average for the season, and did not re-sign with Louisville. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", this was at least in part because Hastings was not considered a team player.\nGuelph Maple Leafs (1877).\nNo National League team attempted to sign Hastings before the season, so he began the year playing for the Guelph Maple Leafs of the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players. From May 17 to June 21, Hastings appeared in eight games with the Canadian club, during which he hit .138 and scored two runs.\nCincinnati Reds (1877).\nOn July 3 of 1877, Hastings was signed by the Cincinnati Reds, who had briefly disbanded and lost some of their players to other teams. He caught 20 games for the Reds, the largest number out of the six players who caught five or more games for the team. Hastings batted only .141 for the season, his last in the majors.\nPersonal life and death.\nHastings had gotten married by 1874.\nAfter retiring from baseball, Hastings worked as a clerk for A.T. Stewart and Company in Chicago. He eventually moved to Santa Cruz, California, where he worked at various times for an electric company, as a box maker, and as a laborer in a powder mill. He died of stomach cancer at the Sawtelle Veterans Home in 1907."

        "text": "David W. Smith (born March 17, 1948) is an American microbiologist, baseball historian and analyst, and statistician. He is best known as the founder of Retrosheet, a volunteer organization whose mission is to collect, digitize, and distribute play-by-play accounts from every game in Major League Baseball history. Additionally, Smith also writes research articles on baseball. Smith's work in baseball research has been widely praised and he has received a number of awards for his work, including from the Society for American Baseball Research and the Baseball Reliquary.\nEarly life and career.\nSmith was born in Dayton, Ohio on March 17, 1948. His family moved to Connecticut when he was two before eventually settling in San Diego, California. Smith became a baseball fan at a very young age and was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers before the team even moved to the West Coast, seeing his first game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1958; the first at-bat he saw was between Richie Ashburn of the Phillies and Sandy Koufax of the Dodgers – both future Hall of Famers.\nAfter graduating high school, Smith graduated from the University of California, San Diego with bachelor's degree in biology, and from Indiana University with a master's degree in microbiology. He earned his PhD from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and did two years of postgraduate work at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nFrom 1975 to 2014, Smith worked as a professor of microbiology (with an emphasis on ecology, genetics, and evolution) at the University of Delaware, during which time he wrote a number of scientific papers and two textbooks on microbiology. He was the director of the undergraduate biology program and the grievance officer of the Delaware chapter of the American Association of University Professors. He won the university's Excellence in Teaching Award in 1977, and was Faculty Senate President in 1983–1984.\nBaseball.\nA baseball enthusiast since childhood, Smith founded Retrosheet in 1989 for the purpose of compiling play-by-play accounts of as many major league games before 1984 as possible (data for games since 1984 has collected by Project Scoresheet/Baseball Workshop and other organizations). In addition to collecting accounts of major league games, Retrosheet also publishes research papers on baseball with the help of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).\nAs of 2013, Retrosheet had recovered the box scores and entered in the likely play-by-play for over 70% of all the major league games played between 1903 (the start of the modern era of baseball, with the first World Series) and 1984, representing over 115,000 games. As of June 2023, Retrosheet has the play-by-play descriptions for all games played between 1973 and 1983, with a list of \"games needed\" indexed by season going back to 1920.\nAdditionally, Smith has contributed to \"Total Baseball\", the official baseball encyclopedia, and has written a number of journal articles for the Society for American Baseball Research; he received the Doug Pappas Award for best oral research presentation by SABR in 2001 (on the 1951 NL Pennant Race) and 2016 (on the role of closers in baseball).\nFor his services to baseball, Smith received the 2001 \"SABR Salute\". He has subsequently been awarded the Bob Davids Award in 2005, and the Henry Chadwick Award in 2012 by SABR for \"services to baseball research\". In 2008, Smith received the Tony Salin Memorial Award from the Baseball Reliquary for his \"commitment to the preservation of baseball history\"."

        "text": "Matthew Joseph White (born August 19, 1977) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played for the Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, and Washington Nationals between 2003 and 2005. He made news in 2007 for his possession of a potentially-lucrative stone quarry in his native Massachusetts.\nBaseball career.\nAmateur.\nA native of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, White attended Wahconah Regional High School in Dalton, Massachusetts and played his college baseball at Clemson. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was named a league all-star. He was first drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the amateur draft. He has been through the Rule V Draft twice. In , he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox. In , he was drafted by the Colorado Rockies.\nProfessional.\nWhite pitched in seven different organizations over nine professional seasons. He has three stints in the majors: he pitched three games for the Boston Red Sox in 2003 before being traded to the Seattle Mariners, for whom he pitched three more games in the same season. In , he pitched one game for the Washington Nationals.\nIn seven major-league games, White pitched 9 innings with an 0-2 record. He allowed 17 hits, eight walks and 18 runs, for a 16.76 ERA and a WHIP of 2.59.\nIn in the minor leagues, he played for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, where he played 38 games, starting 13 of them. He had a record of 7-9 with a 3.58 ERA and 69 strikeouts. He also played for the Navegantes del Magallanes in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he went 2-4 in ten starts with a 3.40 ERA and 34 strikeouts.\nWhite was a non-roster invitee to the Los Angeles Dodgers in . In spring training, he only allowed one earned run in 7 innings.\nHowever, he failed to make the major league roster and was optioned to the Las Vegas 51s, the Dodgers Triple-A team. He was 2-4 with a 3.83 ERA in 40 games out of the bullpen for the 51s during the 1st half of the 2007 Pacific Coast League season.\nOn June 25, 2007, he asked for, and was granted, his release from the 51s so that he could sign a contract to play baseball in Japan. He signed with the Yokohama BayStars. He was released on August 15, .\nOn Jan. 2, 2010, The Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions of the CPBL(Taiwan) announced that they signed White for the 2010 season.\nRock discovery.\nIn 2003, White purchased of mountain real estate in Cummington, Massachusetts from his aunt for $50,000, giving her the money she needed to enter a nursing home. His original intention was to build his home, but he found the land to be too hard. When he called a surveyor out to inspect the land, the surveyor found that the land was solid Goshen stone, a type of mica schist estimated to be about 400 million years old. Estimates have placed the low estimate of the find at 24 million tons. At current prices (he has been selling the stone for over $100/ton), it is estimated to be worth around $2.5 billion, minus extraction costs.\nWhite has begun a small-scale extraction operation, Swift River Stone, and made $600,000 in 2006. He has expressed interest in selling the land, and believes he will get \"several million dollars.\"\nWhen a story broke on most sports news outlets about him on February 28, 2007, some of his teammates in spring training started referring to him in the clubhouse as \"Mr. Billionaire.\"\nIn early 2009, White listed the 45± acre property with Boston-based real estate firm, LandVest, Inc., which specializes in the marketing of luxury residences, vacant land and resource-based properties, including timberland. The asking price for the property is available upon request. \nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Reference (Minor, Winter, Japanese and Independent Leagues), or Retrosheet"

        "text": "Sherman Cedric Williams (born August 13, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys; he was a member of their Super Bowl XXX team that defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide and was selected by the Cowboys in the second round of the 1995 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nWilliams attended Mattie T. Blount High School, where as a senior he became the first running back in Alabama prep history to rush for over 3,000 yards in a season, after registering 3,004 rushing yards, 307 carries and 31 touchdowns. He also received All-State honors, while leading his team to the Class 5A state title and receiving player of the year honors.\nCollege career.\nIn 1990 he accepted a football scholarship from the University of Alabama. As a freshman, he played in 8 games, tallying 108 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.\nAs a sophomore during the '91–'92 season, he was the team's fourth leading rusher behind Derrick Lassic, collecting 299 yards on 64 carries and 8 touchdowns. His best game came against Louisiana State University, when he rushed for 69 yards and 2 touchdowns on 10 carries. He was a member of the 1992 National Championship team. In the Sugar Bowl against the University of Miami, he had the first touchdown of the game, a two-yard run.\nAs a junior during the '92–'93 season, he was named the starter in the third game in place of an injured Chris Anderson. He never gave back the job and opened the season with five straight 100 rushing yard games. He posted 738 rushing yards with 9 touchdowns, including 148 yards on 24 carries against the University of Arkansas.\nAs a senior during the '93–'94 season, he rushed for 1,341 yards (second in school history) and became only the fourth Bama player to reach 1,000 rushing yards in a season. His 291 carries broke the school record for a season and his 138.5 all-purpose yards-per-game ranked 16th best in the nation. He earned All-SEC and second-team All-American honors in 1994. In the Florida Citrus Bowl, he became the first Bama player to gain over 100 yards rushing and receiving in a postseason game, after posting 166 rushing yards on 27 carries and 8 receptions for 155 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown reception for the winning touchdown with 42 seconds remaining, in the 24–17 victory over Ohio State University.\nWilliams finished his college career with 2,486 rushing yards (fifth in school history), 535 carries (third in school history), 27 rushing touchdowns (fourth in school history) and 424 receiving yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. He is also remembered for his signature touchdown dance, the \"Sherman Shake\".\nProfessional career.\nEntering the 1995 NFL draft, the Dallas Cowboys considered their roster so strong, that they drafted players based on their contributions as backups. The team traded their first round draft choice (#28-Derrick Brooks) to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two second-round picks (#41-Ron Davis and #63-Shane Hannah). The Cowboys selected Williams with their first choice in the second round (46th overall), which was criticized by the media and quarterback Troy Aikman, for using a high selection on a backup player. As a rookie, he was a part of the Super Bowl XXX championship team. He tallied 205 rushing yards (second on the team) and one touchdown.\nIn 1996, he had 269 rushing yards. In 1997, he was expected to relieve more of Emmitt Smith's workload, but the additional playing time exposed him as fumble-prone, even though he had a career-high 468 rushing yards.\nWilliams was released during the 1998 offseason, after the team signed Chris Warren to be the backup running back to improve their depth. When Warren strained his groin in preseason, the team re-signed Williams as insurance. He contributed by being third on the team on special teams tackles (17) and while Warren's injury forced him to miss eight regular season games, Williams stepped up against the New York Giants in Week 3, when he rushed for 61 yards on 20 carries (including an 18-yard touchdown run) and in the final game of the regular season against the Washington Redskins, when he rushed for 90 yards on 23 carries and also caught three passes for 19 yards.\nIn the spring of 1999, Williams played for the Mobile Admirals of the short-lived Regional Football League. The Admirals were league champions, and Williams was named league MVP. In the 1999 NFL preseason, after the Cowboys third team running back (Tarik Smith) suffered a season-ending knee surgery, Williams was once more re-signed, but was eventually released after the first game of the regular season.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2000, Williams was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison, for three counts of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and a separate plea for passing counterfeit currency. Saying that his time as a professional football player toughened him, Williams said in a prison interview, \"You know, I would think that things that would kill the average man wouldn't even make me flinch\". He was incarcerated on April 20, 2000. He was released on March 1, 2014.\nAfter his release from prison, Williams started a community assistance program for disadvantaged children and returned to the University of Alabama, receiving his degree in May 2018."
