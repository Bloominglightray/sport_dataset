The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 9th season.\nSeason.\nThe hockey team got some help at the start of the season when Beebe Lake froze in December. The ice was thin but it could be skated on, allowing the team to practice much earlier than they had in recent years. The team was preparing for their first game against Union but the game was scuppered when four members of the opposition came down with Influenza.\nWeather became a concern prior to the next match but the Big Red managed to find enough solid ice to play the game. The puddles and cracks ended up hampering the team and led to a fairly slow match. Unfortunately, Cornell wasn't able to score in the game, despite several chances, and lost 0–1. Cornell was able to even their record with a road win against Williams a week later. Llop ended up with the team's first goal of the season but it was the defensive work in the later part of the game that won it for the Big Red.\nAfter the semester break, Cornell would have to content with a change in net as Rhodes replaced Heye, whose heroics had won the Williams match. He ended up turning in a fine performance and the Big Red won their next game 3–1. Their next game looked to be the team's biggest challenge of the season as they took on a very strong Clarkson squad. The team played hard but the Golden Knights were too much for them and overwhelmed the normally stingy Cornell defense with 5 goals. Rhodes performed well despite taking a stick in the eye and remaining in the contest.\nEntering the final game of the season, Cornell lost three regular players to academic ineligibility and would have to replace Guthrie, Kingsbury and Llop. Endemann, Redding and Schoales each played their first game of the season, serving as alternates, with normal alternates filling in the starting roles. Captain Clark also switched to wing for the game, allowing Spitzmiller to start at center. All the changes caused a bit of havoc for the team and the Big Red ended up losing the match 1–2.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

It was the first ever bilateral A team series by the two teams. The 50-over matches were used as preparation for the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nIn the opening match of the series, Nida Dar became the first bowler, male of female, to take 100 wickets in T20I cricket for Pakistan.\nOn 2 July 2021, during the second WT20I match, West Indies players Chinelle Henry and Chedean Nation collapsed on the field in a space of ten minutes, at the Coolidge Cricket Ground in Antigua. Both of them were immediately taken to hospital, where they were reported to be conscious and stable. However, the match continued, with both players replaced by substitutes. Both of them recovered and joined the West Indies' squad ahead of the third WT20I.\nPakistan's A Team won the first two 20-over fixtures, to win the series with a match to spare. Conversely, the West Indies won the first two WT20I matches, to also win the series with a game to spare. The Pakistan A Team won the third 20-over match by eight wickets, to win the series 3–0. The West Indies won the third WT20I match by six wickets, to win the series 3–0. The West Indies won the first three WODI matches, to win the series with two games to spare. Pakistan A continued their winning streak, with victory in the first two 50-over matches, taking an unassailable series lead. Pakistan A won their final match by seven wickets to remain unbeaten across all six of their matches. In the final match of the tour, Pakistan beat the West Indies by 22 runs in a rain-affected match, with the West Indies winning the WODI series 3–2.\nSquads.\nPakistan did not name individual squads for the WODI and WT20I matches, opting instead to name a combined squad of 26 players for the tour. Conversely, the West Indies named squads for both the national and A teams. Stafanie Taylor was named as their captain, with Reniece Boyce leading the A Team for both the 20-over and 50-over matches.

        "text": "The 2021 Tour de France was the 108th edition of Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Tour began in Brest, France on 26 June, and Stage 11 from Sorgues to Malaucène occurred on 7 July. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 18 July.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage of the Tour featured a hilly course from Brest to Landerneau. Brest hosted the Grand Départ for the fourth time in the Tour's history, with the last time being in 2008. The course featured six categorised climbs, giving the riders plenty of opportunities to take points for the mountains classification. There was also an intermediate sprint in Brasparts with to go. The finale featured an uphill finish, with the riders finishing atop the Côte de la Fosse aux Loups, at long with an average gradient of 5.7 percent. The first 500 metres of the climb averaged 9.4 percent before gradually easing towards the top.\nSeveral attacks marked the start of the stage before a group of five broke away from the peloton. The break included Franck Bonnamour (), Ide Schelling (), Anthony Perez (), Danny van Poppel (), and Cristián Rodríguez (). Connor Swift () eventually made it across to create a six-man group up front. The peloton let the break gain a maximum advantage of almost four minutes before the chase began. The break worked together before Schelling attacked on the fourth climb of the day, the Côte de Stang ar Garront. He quickly began to build his advantage over the rest of the break, which was eventually caught with around to go, just ahead of the intermediate sprint. Schelling took maximum points at the intermediate sprint while Caleb Ewan () outsprinted Peter Sagan () for second.\nWith to go, Tony Martin () was brought down by a spectator who was holding a sign, causing a crash which brought down most of the peloton. The crash caused the abandonment of Jasha Sütterlin () due to injury while the peloton briefly neutralised the race to allow the riders who were held back to latch back on. Following a regrouping in the peloton, Schelling was swept up with around to go, but not before taking enough points to take the lead in the mountains classification. With to go, a touch of wheels caused another crash which brought down several riders, with Cyril Lemoine () and Ignatas Konovalovas () also crashing out of the race. Four-time Tour winner Chris Froome was also among the riders to crash heavily but he managed to get up and slowly make his way across the finish line, eventually finishing over 13 minutes in arrears. The riders soon battled for position at the front of the peloton as they reached the foot of the final climb of the day. With to go, Dries Devenyns took to the front to lead out an attack for team leader Julian Alaphilippe (), who immediately created a gap over the rest of the reduced peloton while Pierre Latour () unsuccessfully tried to bridge over to Alaphilippe. The top two riders from last year's Tour, Tadej Pogačar () and Primož Roglič (), also tried to bridge over but they were swept up. Alaphilippe maintained his advantage all the way to the line to take the first \"maillot jaune\" of this year's Tour. Eight seconds behind, Michael Matthews () won the sprint for second while Roglič finished third to take four crucial bonus seconds in the fight for the GC.\nRace organisers stated they were happy to have fans beside the road, but rider safety is paramount, adding that they planned to sue the spectator who caused the crash. The next day, French police said they were initiating a manhunt. News outlets reported on 30 June that the person concerned, a 30-year old French woman, had turned herself in and was arrested, and that a charge of \"involuntarily causing injury\" was being considered, an offence that carries a fine of €1,500. Due to significant interest in the incident, organisers withdrew their suit against the person on 1 July with general director Christian Prudhomme saying that the incident \"has been blown out of proportion.\" The Cyclistes Professionnels Associés ended up filling a suit against the fan.\nThe woman, who was not identified, went on trial in Brest in October 2021. In December, she was ordered to pay a combined fine of €1,201.\nStage 2.\nFor the second day in a row, the riders faced a hilly course with another uphill finish. This time, the riders finished atop the climb of Mûr-de-Bretagne, which featured on the route for the fourth time in the last ten years. There were six categorised climbs on the route and the intermediate sprint took place in [[Plouha]] after . The climb of Mûr-de-Bretagne is long with an average gradient of 6.9 percent. The first kilometre averages at 9.8 percent before easing towards the top. The climb is featured twice on the route, with the riders cresting the top of the climb for the first time with left and then at the finish. The first ascent also offered eight, five, and two bonus seconds to the first three riders to crest the top.\nAs a result of injuries inflicted from the crashes in the previous day, [[Marc Soler]] () became the fourth rider to abandon the Tour. After several attacks marked the start of the stage, six riders eventually broke away from the peloton, including the king of the mountains leader, [[Ide Schelling]] (). The sextet was allowed to build a gap of around four minutes before began to chase the break. Schelling and his closest rival in the mountains classification, [[Anthony Perez (cyclist)|Anthony Perez]] (), each took a point at the first two climbs of the day. After the six breakaway riders took the maximum points at the intermediate sprint, [[Caleb Ewan]] () outsprinted [[Mark Cavendish]] () to take more points in the battle for the green jersey. On the third climb of the day, [[Edward Theuns]] () attacked from the break, with [[Jérémy Cabot]] () the only other rider to respond to his attack. However, the duo's advantage gradually decreased as the riders reached the foot of the climb of Mûr-de-Bretagne for the first time.\nAs soon as the duo was caught at the foot of Mûr-de-Bretagne, [[Mathieu van der Poel]] () attacked from the peloton. He would build an advantage of around 13 seconds before gradually decreased his advantage. He would pick up the eight bonus seconds at the top while [[Tadej Pogačar]] () outsprinted [[Primož Roglič]] () to take back three seconds from his fellow Slovenian. van der Poel was caught at the top before took over at the front of the peloton. As the riders reached the bottom of Mûr-de-Bretagne for the second time, [[Davide Formolo]] () accelerated, building a small gap before [[Nairo Quintana]] () produced a counterattack of his own. [[Sonny Colbrelli]] () also attacked just under the \"flamme rouge\" before van der Poel made his decisive move with 800 metres to go. He continued to build his lead before soloing across the finish line. Pogačar, Roglič, and [[Wilco Kelderman]] () crossed the line six seconds in arrears, with Pogačar outsprinting Roglič for second to take back two more seconds from his compatriot. The remnants of the reduced peloton crossed the line a further two seconds in arrears. One notable absence in this group was [[Geraint Thomas]] (), who came home at 23 seconds behind van der Poel and 17 seconds behind the two Slovenians. In the GC, van der Poel took enough time to take the \"maillot jaune\", with [[Julian Alaphilippe]] () dropping to second at eight seconds back. Pogačar moved up to third at 13 seconds behind and one second ahead of Roglič, who dropped to fourth. van der Poel also took the lead in the mountains classification after he took maximum points on both ascents of Mûr-de-Bretagne.\nStage 3.\nThe third stage of the Tour offered the first chance for the pure sprinters to battle it out for the win. This time, the riders traveled from Lorient to Pontivy. The opening third of the stage was mostly flat before the riders traveled on rolling roads for the rest of the stage. There were two fourth-category climbs on the route, the [[:fr:Côte de Cadoudal|Côte de Cadoudal]] and the Côte de Pluméliau, along with an intermediate sprint at La Fourchette in [[Pleugriffet]] after .\nAs soon as the flag dropped, a group of five riders broke away from the peloton, including [[Ide Schelling]] (), who had featured in the break during the previous two days and was deputizing in the polka-dot jersey for classification and race leader [[Mathieu van der Poel]] (). The break's advantage reached a maximum of around three minutes before the sprinters' teams started to chase them. After of racing, a crash in the peloton brought down [[Geraint Thomas]] () and [[Robert Gesink]] (), with the latter eventually having to abandon the race. It was soon reported that Thomas suffered from a dislocated shoulder, but he continued in the race and eventually made it back to the peloton with the help of his team. At the first climb of the day, Schelling attacked to gain the solitary mountain point at the top. This allowed him to take the lead once again in the king of the mountains competition. Shortly afterwards, he dropped back to the peloton to make it a quartet up front. At the intermediate sprint, after the four breakaway riders took the maximum points, [[Caleb Ewan]] () once again outsprinted [[Mark Cavendish]] () in the battle for the points jersey. Afterwards, the peloton gradually reduced the break's advantage as they prepared themselves for the bunch sprint.\nInside the final , several crashes took place in the peloton. The first crash took place close to the ten-kilometre mark and involved [[Miguel Ángel López (cyclist)|Miguel Ángel López]] () and [[Valentin Madouas]] (). Shortly afterwards, [[Primož Roglič]] () crashed heavily on the side of the road. He got up but by the time he started riding again, he was already more than a minute down on the peloton, with most of his teammates trying to pace him back. Shortly after the break was caught with around to go, another crash took place, with [[Jack Haig (cyclist)|Jack Haig]] () among those to fall; Haig was eventually forced to abandon the race. [[Tadej Pogačar]] (), [[David Gaudu]] (), [[Rigoberto Urán]] (), and Thomas were also held up in the crash but they were able to escape unscathed. Inside the \"flamme rouge\", the sprinters prepared themselves for the final sprint. However, Ewan went down following a touch of wheels also taking down [[Peter Sagan]] () in the process. While Sagan was able to continue in the race, Ewan needed medical attention and eventually had to abandon due to a fractured collarbone. In the final sprint, [[Jasper Philipsen]] () led out teammate [[Tim Merlier]] for the win, with Philipsen himself holding off [[Nacer Bouhanni]] () to make it a one-two finish for . In the aftermath of the crashes, several contenders lost time. A group containing [[Enric Mas]] (), [[Vincenzo Nibali]] (), [[Jakob Fuglsang]] (), [[Nairo Quintana]] (), and [[Wilco Kelderman]] () lost 14 seconds at the line. The group containing Pogačar, Gaudu, Urán, and Thomas lost 26 seconds at the finish. The biggest time loss was suffered by Roglič as he lost almost a minute and a half at the line.\nIn the GC, [[Mathieu van der Poel]] () was able to stay in the front group and thus kept the \"maillot jaune\". [[Julian Alaphilippe]] () also avoided the crashes to retain his second place. [[Richard Carapaz]] (), the only GC contender to not be held up by the crashes, moved up to third at 31 seconds behind.\nStage 4.\n[[File:2021 Tour de France - stage 4, intermediate sprint.webm|thumb|250px|The intermediate sprint in [[Vitré (Ille-et-Vilaine)|Vitré]]]]\nThe fourth stage of the Tour took the riders from Redon to Fougères. The route offered another chance for the sprinters to shine as there were no categorised climbs on the course. The only intermediate sprint of the day took place in [[Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine|Vitré]] with to go.\nAs soon as the riders reached kilometre zero, the whole peloton stopped for a full minute as a form of protest in the aftermath of the crashes in the previous day. The riders had felt that the crashes were partly due to the dangerous run-in to Pontivy. After stopping at kilometre zero, the riders also rode slowly for the first . As soon as those kilometres passed, [[Brent Van Moer]] () became the first rider to go on the attack, and he was soon joined by [[Pierre-Luc Périchon]] (). The peloton never gave the lead duo much of an advantage, with the gap maxing out at around three minutes before the sprinters' teams began to chase them down. After the two breakaway riders took the maximum points at the intermediate sprint, [[Michael Mørkøv]] () successfully led out his teammate [[Mark Cavendish]], who took the maximum remaining points on offer.\nWith the break's advantage being reduced to around 30 seconds with to go, Périchon launched an attack that was immediately answered by Van Moer. Van Moer countered with an attack of his own, successfully dropping his breakaway companion as the peloton continued to chase behind. Soon after, the pace slowed in the peloton, allowing Van Moer's lead to increase to more than a minute. The lead stabilised until around were left on the stage, at which point the pace in the peloton increased. Van Moer's lead rapidly decreased as the sprinters' teams set up their riders for the finish. With to go, Van Moer still maintained a 15-second lead, but the peloton was rapidly closing in on him. Van Moer was eventually caught with 200 metres to go as the previous day's winner, [[Tim Merlier]] (), led out his team's other sprinter, [[Jasper Philipsen]]. Philipsen opened up the sprint but Cavendish came around him to take his 31st Tour stage win. [[Nacer Bouhanni]] () finished second while Philipsen held on for third. As a result of his win, Cavendish also took the lead in the points classification. There was no change in the GC, with [[Mathieu van der Poel]] () holding an eight-second lead over [[Julian Alaphilippe]] () ahead of the race's first individual time trial.\nStage 5.\nThe fifth stage featured the first of two tests against the clock in this year's Tour as the riders faced a course between Changé and Laval. The course was not totally flat and featured rolling roads. There were two intermediate time checks, at in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Mayenne]], and at in [[Bonchamp-lès-Laval]].\nBeing an [[Individual time trial|ITT]], the riders set off in reverse order to their GC positions. As such, [[Amund Grøndahl Jansen]] () was the first rider off the start ramp. He was also the first finisher of the stage as he set a time of 37' 04\". The first rider to stay in the hot seat for a long time was [[Mikkel Bjerg]] (). He set the quickest times at the two intermediate time checks before setting a time of 33' 01\". Soon after, rain started falling on the route, affecting several riders. One of the riders affected was [[Stefan Bissegger]] (), one of the favorites for the stage win. Having nearly crashed at one point, Bissegger would eventually set a time of 33' 22\", 21 seconds slower than Bjerg's time. Bjerg's teammate, [[Brandon McNulty]], was another rider severely affected by the bad weather. McNulty crashed early on in his ride, and he ended up with the slowest time on the day. After a few minutes, the rain stopped falling. The first rider to beat Bjerg's time was [[Mattia Cattaneo]] (). He was six seconds up on Bjerg at the first time check before being two seconds slower at the second time check. He finished with a time of 32' 55\", six seconds faster than Bjerg. However, his time was quickly beaten by [[Stefan Küng]] (), the reigning European time trial champion. He was the quickest at all time checks before setting a time of 32' 19\", 36 seconds quicker than Cattaneo.\nSoon, the focus shifted to the GC contenders, starting with [[Primož Roglič]] (), having lost a minute due to his crash two days earlier. Despite this, Roglič was still able to set a time of 32' 44\", good enough for seventh on the stage. His teammate, [[Jonas Vingegaard]], fared even better with a time of 32' 27\", the third best time of the day. Another GC rider affected by injuries was [[Geraint Thomas]] (), but unlike Roglič, he struggled on his bike, eventually stopping the clock at 33' 18\". [[Alexey Lutsenko]] () and [[Rigoberto Urán]] () set times of 33' 00\" and 33' 08\", respectively; their results were good for 10th and 13th on the day. To end the stage, the top ten riders took to the course. [[Pierre Latour]] () was 15th quickest on the day as he set a time of 33' 14\". [[Enric Mas]] (), [[Nairo Quintana]] (), and [[David Gaudu]] () struggled on the route as they lost two to two and a half minutes on the day. Soon, defending champion [[Tadej Pogačar]] () went off the start ramp. He smashed Küng's time at both time checks before setting a time of 32' 00\", beating Küng's time by 19 seconds and becoming the only rider to average on the day. His time would not be beaten as he took his first stage win in this year's Tour. [[Wout van Aert]] (), the Belgian time trial champion, was expected to challenge for the win but he only set the fourth-quickest time of 32' 30\", 30 seconds behind Pogačar's time. [[Richard Carapaz]] () and [[Wilco Kelderman]] (), two riders in the top five in the GC, both lost considerable time and conceded almost two minutes to Pogačar. [[Julian Alaphilippe]] (), the winner of the time trial in Pau [[2019 Tour de France|two years ago]], was only able to manage a time of 33' 11\". The last rider to go down the start ramp was [[Mathieu van der Poel]] (), the wearer of the \"maillot jaune\". Although he expected himself to lose the yellow jersey, he was able to set the fifth-quickest time of 32' 31\", only 31 seconds behind Pogačar's time and enough to keep the \"maillot jaune\". \nIn the battle for the GC, Pogačar rose to second, only eight seconds behind van der Poel. Van Aert moved up to third at 30 seconds down while Alaphilippe dropped down to fourth, 48 seconds behind. Lutsenko, Latour, and Urán also moved up the standings but at almost a minute and a half behind van der Poel. Vingegaard moved up to eighth as a result of his third-place finish in the time trial. Three of Pogačar's rivals for the Tour victory, Roglič, Carapaz, and Thomas now lie almost two minutes down on Pogačar.\nStage 6.\n[[File:Thésée-la-Romaine (Loir-et-Cher) (51283161576).jpg|thumb|250px|The stage's main breakaway, consisting of [[Roger Kluge]] (left) and [[Greg Van Avermaet]], passing through [[Thésée, Loir-et-Cher|Thésée]]]]\nThe sixth stage of the race featured a flat course from Tours to Châteauroux and offered another chance for the sprinters to battle it out for the stage win. There was a single fourth-category climb, the [[Saint-Aignan, Morbihan|Côte de Saint-Aignan]], on the route while the intermediate sprint took place in [[Luçay-le-Mâle]] with to go.\nA few kilometres from the start of the stage, a high-profile eight-man break, including [[Thomas De Gendt]] (), [[Greg Van Avermaet]] (), [[Kasper Asgreen]] (), and [[Søren Kragh Andersen]] (), broke away from the peloton. The break also featured other riders from sprinters' teams. The best-placed GC rider from the break was Asgreen, sitting in 11th at 1' 49\" down on race leader [[Mathieu van der Poel]] (). With most of the sprinters' teams represented in the break, it was up to and , other sprinters' teams who had no riders in the break, to chase the group. The group led by as much as a minute before the gap began to come down. With to go, the break split in half before eventually regrouping. However, the presence of Asgreen, resulting in a lack of cooperation, meant the group was eventually caught but not before Van Avermaet soloed off the front. The only rider to bridge up to him was [[Roger Kluge]] (). The pair gained an advantage of around two minutes before being chased down. The duo would also take maximum points at the intermediate sprint. In a messy sprint for the remaining points on offer, [[Sonny Colbrelli]] () took third ahead of [[Michael Mørkøv]] ().\nWith to go, the pair's advantage was down to just 13 seconds before the peloton slightly eased off, allowing the pair to build their advantage once again. With to go, the break still had an advantage of 40 seconds, but the peloton was starting to close in on them. The pair was eventually caught with to go as the sprinters' teams prepared themselves for the sprint. With the final of the stage being on a straight road all the way to the line, the lead-out trains prepared for the final sprint; chief among those trains were and . From the latter team, Stage 3 winner [[Tim Merlier]] once again tried to lead out his teammate [[Jasper Philipsen]], with points classification leader [[Mark Cavendish]] () switching from the wheel of his lead-out man Mørkøv to that of Philipsen. In the last 150 metres, Cavendish came around both riders to win his 32nd Tour stage win. Philipsen took second while [[Nacer Bouhanni]] () finished third. With his win, it marked the third time that Cavendish won in Chateauroux; the first was in [[2008 Tour de France|2008]] when he took his first Tour stage win before winning there again in [[2011 Tour de France|2011]]. He also increased his lead in the points classification to 46 points over Philipsen. Van der Poel finished safely in the peloton to retain the \"maillot jaune\", with the top ten on GC unchanged.\nStage 7.\nThe seventh stage featured a hilly course from Vierzon to Le Creusot. With a distance of , it was the longest stage of this year's Tour and the race's longest stage in the past 20 years. The first of the stage was mostly flat, with the intermediate sprint taking place in [[Saint-Benin-d'Azy]] after . Afterwards, the riders tackled five categorized climbs in the final of the stage. The most crucial climb among these was the second-category climb of [[:fr:Signal d'Uchon|Signal d'Uchon]], which topped with left on the stage. The climb was long with an average gradient of 5.7 percent while the last of the climb averaged 11.2 percent. The top of the climb also offered eight, five, and two bonus seconds to the first three riders. The finish of the stage was on a slightly uphill drag.\nSeveral attacks marked the start of the day until a dangerous 29-man break went away with around to go. The break included riders such as [[Mathieu van der Poel]] (), the \"maillot jaune\", [[Wout van Aert]] (), [[Vincenzo Nibali]] (), [[Philippe Gilbert]] (), [[Mark Cavendish]] (), the leader of the points classification, [[Kasper Asgreen]] () and [[Simon Yates (cyclist)|Simon Yates]] (). tried to chase the break quickly but their advantage gradually went up. The team ended up chasing for much of the day. The break's lead reached a maximum of around seven minutes before the gap stabilized. At the intermediate sprint, Cavendish took the maximum points, increasing his lead in the points classification to 66 over [[Jasper Philipsen]] (). With around to go, [[Matej Mohorič]] () attacked from the break together with [[Brent Van Moer]] (). Mohorič proceeded to take maximum points over the first two climbs as the pair increased their advantage to a minute over the rest of the break. From behind, [[Victor Campenaerts]] () and [[Jasper Stuyven]] () attacked, eventually bridging up to the pair up front. Several riders also attempted to attack from the break, but no attack stuck.\nOn the third climb of the day, Campenaerts ended up getting dropped from the leading group while several attacks ended up splitting the second group. Mohorič picked up the maximum points at the top, putting him into a tie with [[Ide Schelling]] () for the lead in the king of the mountains competition. The leading trio had a lead of more than a minute and a half over the second group as they reached the foot of the second-category Signal d'Uchon. On the climb's steep section, Mohorič attacked for the mountains classification points at the summit, but after seeing the gap he created, he pushed on and dropped both of his companions in the leading group. He eventually soloed to the top, with Stuyven cresting in second after dropping Van Moer. [[Patrick Konrad]] () also attacked from the second group as he tried to bridge to the front, with Asgreen, [[Magnus Cort]] (), and [[Franck Bonnamour]] () chasing closely behind. With around to go, van Aert attacked together with van der Poel, with the duo eventually bridging to Konrad's group in the final kilometre. Up front, Mohorič gradually increased his advantage before soloing to the line. Stuyven crossed the line in second at almost a minute and a half behind Mohorič while Cort won the sprint for third. With the win, Mohorič completed his set of taking a stage win at all three Grand Tours. He also took the lead in the king of the mountains competition and won the day's combativity award.\nIn the GC group, continued to control the peloton, with the team getting some occasional help from . At one point in the stage, [[Jonas Vingegaard]] () crashed but he would make his way back to the peloton. The group remained relatively quiet until they reached the climb of Signal d'Uchon. The first rider to attack was [[Pierre Latour]] (). As the pace in the peloton increased, [[Primož Roglič]] () was dropped from the peloton. Roglič continued to lose time until the end of the stage, eventually conceding more than three minutes to the peloton and effectively ending his chances for Tour victory. Near the top of Signal d'Uchon, [[Geraint Thomas]] () was briefly dropped but managed to make his way back to the peloton. At around the same point, his teammate, [[Richard Carapaz]] attacked, with no response from [[Tadej Pogačar]] (). He led by as much as 40 seconds at one point and also found help from his teammate, [[Dylan van Baarle]], who was dropped from the break. However, would chase down his move, with the peloton catching him right at the finish.\nIn the GC, van der Poel's lead increased to 30 seconds, as van Aert moved up to second. Asgreen is now third at 1' 49\" down while Mohorič moved up to fourth at 3' 01\" behind. Pogačar dropped down to fifth, almost four minutes down on van der Poel while Nibali moved up to sixth at more than four minutes behind. As a result of his time loss, Roglič dropped to 33rd on GC, more than nine minutes behind van der Poel and almost five and a half minutes behind Pogačar.\nStage 8.\nThe race headed to the Alps for the first time in this year's Tour on stage 8, with the riders travelling from Oyonnax to Le Grand-Bornard. From the get-go, the riders tackled of an uncategorized climb, providing a launchpad for the break to get away. The intermediate sprint took place in [[Frangy]] after before the riders headed into the mountains. After two climbs, a third- and fourth-category respectively, the riders took on three first-category climbs. The first of these was the [[Mont-Saxonnex|Côte de Mont-Saxonnex]], a climb with an average gradient of 8.3 percent. A short descent led to the foot of the [[Col de Romme]], long with an average gradient of 8.9 percent. Another short descent led to the final climb of the day, the [[Col de la Colombière]], long with an average gradient of 8.5 percent. The riders topped the Colombière with to go. Eight, five, and two bonus seconds, respectively, were awarded to the first three riders across the top. The riders then reached the finish in Le Grand-Bornard after a descent and a short flat section.\nWith an uncategorized climb to start the day, several riders attempted to attack before [[Wout Poels]] () soloed off the front. A chasing group immediately formed while the peloton rode closely behind. Near the top of the climb, an injured [[Geraint Thomas]] () was unable to maintain the pace. On the descent, the peloton split, with [[Pierre Latour]] (), sitting in the top ten on GC, among the riders caught out. Later, another injured pre-race favorite, [[Primož Roglič]] () was dropped on the flat section. These three GC contenders would each finish over 30 minutes down on the stage, with their GC aspirations all but dashed. At this point, no breakaway had stuck. At the intermediate sprint, [[Sonny Colbrelli]] () took maximum points ahead of [[Michael Matthews (cyclist)|Michael Matthews]] (). At one point, [[Tadej Pogačar]] () found himself in the breakaway but soon rejoined the main peloton. On the first first-category climb of the day, Poels attacked solo once again. Eventually, with to go, the peloton settled down while a chase group formed, which eventually caught Poels. They built their advantage over the -led peloton as they neared the top of Côte de Mont-Saxonnex. Poels was first over the top of the first-category climb, putting him in the lead of the king of the mountains competition.\nJust before the second category-one climb of Col de Romme, the duo of [[Søren Kragh Andersen]] and [[Tiesj Benoot]] attacked from the break. In the peloton, a crash involving [[Jonas Vingegaard]] () and [[Stefan de Bod]] () took place, but both riders were able to get back to the peloton. As the break reached the Col de Romme, [[Michael Woods (cyclist)|Michael Woods]] () attacked, eventually passing Kragh Andersen, and soloing off the front. The break fragmented as a chase group formed in pursuit of Woods. Woods gained an advantage of more than a minute on the chasers as he took maximum mountain points at the top while Poels took second in the chasing group. Soon, the break reached the final first-category climb of the day, the Col de la Colombière. At this point, Woods started to fade and his advantage gradually came down. from the top, [[Dylan Teuns]] () caught Woods while the chasing group began to fragment. A kilometre from the top, Teuns dropped Woods as he soloed to the top. He kept his advantage all the way to the line, soloing to the stage win.\nIn the main peloton, controlled the group of contenders for much of the day. As they reached the Col de Romme, [[Davide Formolo]] increased the pace in the group and dropped the \"maillot jaune\", [[Mathieu van der Poel]] (), while [[Wout van Aert]] () and [[Julian Alaphilippe]] () also began to struggle. With to the top of the Romme, Pogačar launched an attack and only [[Richard Carapaz]] () was able to stay with him. After Carapaz refused to work, Pogačar accelerated once again, dropping Carapaz for good. Pogačar gradually increased his advantage over Carapaz while also passing the remnants of the breakaway. At the top of the Colombière, Pogačar had increased his advantage to more than three minutes over Carapaz while also getting to within 20 seconds of catching Teuns. On the descent to the finish, Pogačar avoided taking risks, with Woods and [[Ion Izagirre]] () eventually catching him. Izagirre eventually finished second, more than 40 seconds behind Teuns with Woods taking third. Pogačar finished fourth on the day at almost 50 seconds behind Teuns. On the descent from the Colombière, Carapaz was caught by the group of the other contenders, eventually finishing more than four minutes behind and conceding more than three minutes to Pogačar. Van Aert tried to limit his losses but he had lost more than five minutes by the end.\nIn the GC, Pogačar took the \"maillot jaune\" with a lead of almost two minutes on van Aert. [[Alexey Lutsenko]] () moved up to third, more than four and a half minutes behind. From third to ninth in the GC, the riders were separated by less than a minute and a half from each other. [[Pello Bilbao]] () climbed into tenth, almost seven minutes behind Pogačar.\nStage 9.\nThe second day in the Alps took the riders from Cluses to the race's first mountaintop finish at Tignes. Tignes was supposed to be visited in [[2019 Tour de France|2019]] as the finish of [[2019 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 21#Stage 19|Stage 19]], but the stage was cut short due to avalanche and landslides near [[Val-d'Isère]] on the ascent to Tignes. The first of the stage were flat before the riders reached the second-category climb of Côte de Domancy. The intermediate sprint took place in [[Praz-sur-Arly]] after , a few kilometres before the riders climbed the first-category [[Col des Saisies]]. Following a long descent, the riders tackled the first \"hors catégorie\" climb of the race, the [[Col du Pré]], at long with an average gradient of 7.7 percent. Immediately after cresting the top and a short descent, the riders reached the second-category climb of [[Cormet de Roselend]]. After another long descent and a short flat section, the riders took on the final climb of the day, the first-category Monteé de Tignes, at long with an average gradient of 5.6 percent. The riders crested the top with to go before a short flat section to the finish line.\nBefore the start of the stage, [[Primož Roglič]] () abandoned the race due to his injuries while [[Mathieu van der Poel]] () also abandoned as he prepared for the [[2020 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. At the start of the stage, [[Harry Sweeny]] () and [[Davide Ballerini]] () kicked off the attacks in the first few kilometres. The pair built a lead of around 40 seconds before being caught at the top of Côte de Domancy, where [[Pierre Latour]] () took maximum points. Several riders would attempt to attack again; chief among them were [[Sonny Colbrelli]] () and [[Michael Matthews (cyclist)|Michael Matthews]] () as they attempted to take the points at the intermediate sprint. Soon, a 41-man group went away before the race reached the intermediate sprint. At the sprint itself, Colbrelli outsprinted Matthews, with the latter moving to within 38 points of [[Mark Cavendish]]'s () lead in the points classification. On the Col des Saisies, the break split as several riders attacked. Mountains classification leader [[Wout Poels]] () soon attacked off the front as he attempted to extend his lead. [[Nairo Quintana]] (), [[Ben O'Connor (cyclist)|Ben O'Connor]] (), [[Sergio Higuita]] (), and [[Michael Woods (cyclist)|Michael Woods]] () formed a chase group behind Poels, with Quintana bridging up to Poels near the top. Poels eventually took maximum points ahead of Quintana, with the latter accelerating on the descent while the peloton crested the top at six minutes behind. As the break reached the foot of Col du Pré, Quintana was joined by Woods, Higuita, O'Connor, and [[Lucas Hamilton]] (), while Poels was briefly distanced before eventually rejoining up front.\nNear the top of Col du Pré, Poels was once again dropped from the lead group with Hamilton also getting dropped soon afterwards. from the top, Quintana accelerated off the front, with Woods the only other rider to follow him. However, Woods was unable to follow his pace, eventually dropping to a chase group with Higuita and O'Connor. Quintana took maximum points at the top of the Pré to take the virtual lead in the king of the mountains classification while Higuita took second. Higuita soon reached Quintana up front, with O'Connor rejoining them shortly afterwards. Quintana took maximum points at the top of Cormet de Roselend to extend his lead in the mountains classification. On the descent, Higuita briefly took off the front and distancing both Quintana and O'Connor, but both riders would eventually make their way back to Higuita at the foot of Monteé de Tignes. O'Connor proceeded to drop both Higuita and Quintana, eventually soloing to the stage win by more than five minutes. [[Mattia Cattaneo]] () finished second on the day after Higuita and Quintana struggled for the rest of the stage. Colbrelli ended up finishing third.\nIn the GC group, controlled for much of the day. At the climb of Col du Pré, [[Wout van Aert]] (), second place in the GC, was dropped. At one point, the peloton was more than nine minutes behind O'Connor, who started the day 8' 13\" behind race leader, [[Tadej Pogačar]] (), and thus O'Connor temporarily became the virtual race leader. At the bottom of Monteé de Tignes, there were still three riders surrounding Pogačar. Halfway through the climb, started to pace in the peloton as they set up their leader, [[Richard Carapaz]]. With around to the top of the climb, Carapaz attacked, with Pogačar immediately responding. Shortly afterwards, Pogačar accelerated himself, dropping all his rivals. Pogačar finished sixth on the stage, six minutes behind O'Connor and 32 seconds ahead of a group containing Carapaz, [[Jonas Vingegaard]] (), [[Enric Mas]] (), and [[Rigoberto Urán]] (). [[Wilco Kelderman]] () lost an additional 13 seconds to the Carapaz group while [[David Gaudu]] () and [[Alexey Lutsenko]] () each lost more than a minute and a half to Pogačar. Additionally, seven riders missed the time cut, including sprinters [[Arnaud Démare]] () and [[Bryan Coquard]] (), and as such they were eliminated from the race. [[Nicholas Dlamini|Nic Dlamini]] (), the first Black South African to ride the Tour de France, was also among those to miss the time cut; after crashing hard early on in the stage, Dlamini fought through his injuries and eventually finished around 85 minutes behind O'Connor.\nIn the general classification, Pogačar kept the \"maillot jaune\" and extended his lead, now at a margin of two minutes over O'Connor, who moved up to second by virtue of his time gains. Urán moved up to third at more than five minutes behind Pogačar, while Vingegaard and Carapaz rounded out the top five. Mas, Kelderman, Lutsenko, and Gaudu shipped even more time but remained in the top ten. [[Guillaume Martin]] (), another rider who benefited from being the break, moved up to ninth, at more than seven minutes in arrears.\nStage 10.\nOn the first stage after the first rest day, riders travelled from Albertville to Valence on a mostly flat course. There was an early fourth-category climb, the [[Col de Couz]], at long and an average gradient of just under 3 percent. The intermediate sprint took place at the top of an uncategorized climb to La Placette, from the finish. With around left, there was another uncategorized long climb up to [[Beauregard-Baret]] that averaged just under 4 percent, which provided an opportunity to put the pure sprinters under difficulty. The course after the descent was flat all the way to the line, with a threat of crosswinds on the way to the finish.\nAs soon as the flag dropped, [[Hugo Houle]] () and [[Tosh Van der Sande]] () established the day's main breakaway. The pair gained a maximum advantage of six minutes before a group containing [[Sonny Colbrelli]] () attempted to break away. The move was quickly shut down before began to lead the chase of the duo up front, with [[Tim Declercq]] () also contributing to the chase. At the only categorized climb of the day, Houle took the only point on offer while the peloton crossed the top at three and a half minutes behind. Just before the intermediate sprint, a minor crash in the peloton involved [[Mads Pedersen (cyclist)|Mads Pedersen]] (), [[Simon Yates (cyclist)|Simon Yates]] (), and [[Julien Simon]] (), but all three escaped generally unscathed. After the duo up front took maximum points at the intermediate sprint, Colbrelli outsprinted [[Michael Matthews (cyclist)|Michael Matthews]] () and [[Jasper Philipsen]] () to close in on [[Mark Cavendish]]'s () lead in the points classification as Cavendish was briefly dropped on the unclassified climb.\nWith around to go, there was another crash in the peloton, with [[Richie Porte]] () the most prominent of the riders involved; Porte sustained a scrape to his left elbow but was otherwise able to continue. On the final uncategorized climb, the breakaway was caught, with van der Sande dropping back first while Houle remained out in front slightly longer to win the stage's combativity award. At this point, tried to drop the pure sprinters on the final uncategorized climb, albeit unsuccessfully. It was also around this point that a cross-tailwind began to affect the peloton as several teams attempted to form echelons. With to go, Colbrelli suffered an untimely puncture, forcing him to change his bike. He was down by nearly 40 seconds at one point but he would eventually make it back after a brief lull in the action. Inside the final , there were several splits in the peloton, with race leader [[Tadej Pogačar]] () getting briefly caught out at one point.\nDespite several attempts to split the peloton, no GC contender was caught out, and the sprinters' teams began to set up for the finish. In the final sprint, — with [[Kasper Asgreen]], [[Davide Ballerini]], and [[Michael Mørkøv]] — once again successfully led out Cavendish for the stage win, his third in this year's Tour and his 33rd career Tour stage win. [[Wout van Aert]] () closed fast along the barriers to take second, while Philipsen came up along the other side of Cavendish to finish third. Pogačar and the other contenders finished safely in the main peloton as the GC remained unchanged ahead of the \"double [[Mont Ventoux|Ventoux]]\" stage.\nStage 11.\nThe eleventh stage took the riders from Sorgues to Malaucène, with the riders tackling the climb of [[Mont Ventoux]] twice. The climb was last featured in the Tour in [[2016 Tour de France, Stage 12 to Stage 21#Stage 12|2016]], when the stage finished at [[Chalet Reynard]] due to strong winds at the top. The early part of the stage featured a pair of fourth-category climbs, the [[Fontaine-de-Vaucluse|Côte de Fontaine-de-Vaucluse]] and the [[Gordes|Côte de Gordes]], sandwiching an intermediate sprint in . After , the riders tackled the first-category , long with an average gradient of 6.7 percent. Following the descent, the riders reached [[Sault, Vaucluse|Sault]], near the foot of the first passage of Mont Ventoux. The ascent from Sault, at long with an average gradient of 5.1 percent, is classified as a first-category climb. For the first , the gradients are not particularly steep but after reaching Chalet Reynard, the average gradient punches up to over 8 percent. After cresting the top, the riders descended towards Malaucène, where they passed near the finish line. Afterwards, the riders circled back through [[Bédoin]] to summit Mont Ventoux again, this time as an \"[[hors catégorie]]\" climb. The ascent from Bédoin is shorter in length, at , but is steeper with an average gradient of 8.8 percent. At the top of the second ascent, bonus seconds of eight, five, and two were offered to the first three riders across. Additionally, it offered double points for the mountains classification. Afterwards, the riders descended into Malaucène again, this time for the stage finish.\nSeveral attacks once again marked the start of the stage. After a few kilometres, [[Tony Martin (cyclist)|Tony Martin]] () crashed into a ditch, forcing him to abandon the race and leaving the team with only five riders. [[Julian Alaphilippe]] () and [[Nairo Quintana]] () soon attacked off the front, with Alaphilippe eventually pushing on on the first climb of the day. He was soon joined by [[Dan Martin (cyclist)|Dan Martin]] (), [[Anthony Perez (cyclist)|Anthony Perez]] (), and [[Pierre Rolland (cyclist)|Pierre Rolland]] (). A 13-man chase group including [[Wout van Aert]] () also formed behind while proceeded to control the peloton. On the Col de la Liguière, Dan Martin took maximum points while the peloton crested the top around five minutes down. On the first ascent of Mont Ventoux, Alaphilippe led an attack that split the break, while behind in the peloton, [[David Gaudu]] (), who was in the top ten on GC, began to struggle. Near the top, [[Bauke Mollema]] () bridged over from the second group to the front group. At the top, Alaphilippe took maximum points while the peloton crossed the top at around four and a half minutes behind. As the break neared the foot of the second ascent of Mont Ventoux, Perez was dropped, with [[Julien Bernard]] () following suit shortly after pacing for his teammates. At the bottom of the climb, [[Kenny Elissonde]] () attacked the break while a chase group composed of Alaphilippe, van Aert, and Mollema formed behind. Van Aert eventually bridged over to Elissonde, and around from the summit, pushed on alone. Behind, Mollema dropped Alaphilippe and bridged up to Elissonde. On the descent, van Aert maintained his lead to win the stage. Elissonde and Mollema crossed the line together over a minute later, with the former winning the stage's combativity award.\nMeanwhile, from behind, continued to pace the peloton. With around to the top, [[Ben O'Connor (cyclist)|Ben O'Connor]] (), second in the GC, was unable to keep up with the pace. [[Michał Kwiatkowski]] () soon increased the pace further, causing [[Enric Mas]] (), [[Pello Bilbao]] (), and [[Guillaume Martin]] () to be distanced as well. from the top of the Ventoux, [[Jonas Vingegaard]] () launched an attack that was only followed by the race leader, [[Tadej Pogačar]] (). [[Richard Carapaz]] () and [[Rigoberto Urán]] () also tried to follow but they were not able to hold Pogačar's wheel. Further up the climb, Vingegaard managed to drop Pogačar, gradually increasing his advantage towards the top. Vingegaard crossed the top around 40 seconds ahead of Pogačar, with Carapaz and Urán riding closely behind the race leader. On the descent, Pogačar, Carapaz, and Urán worked together to bring back Vingegaard, eventually catching him near the \"flamme rouge\". The quartet was led home by Pogačar, 1' 38\" behind van Aert. [[Alexey Lutsenko]] () and [[Wilco Kelderman]] (), who were dropped when Vingegaard attacked, limited their losses and finished 18 seconds behind the yellow jersey group. Mas conceded almost a minute and a half while Bilbao lost almost two minutes. Martin also proceeded to lose nearly two and a half minutes. At the back of the race, after pacing for team leader Carapaz earlier in the stage, domestique [[Luke Rowe]] [[Hitting the wall|hit the wall]] and finished six minutes outside of the time cut, making it a total of eight riders to fall victim to the stage.\nIn the GC, Pogačar kept the \"maillot jaune\", now with an advantage of 5' 18\" over Urán in second with Vingegaard in third at 5' 32\" down. Carapaz sat in fourth, one second behind Vingegaard while O'Connor lost four minutes to drop down to fifth. Kelderman and Lutsenko were still less than a minute behind Vingegaard while Mas dropped down to eighth. Martin and Bilbao rounded out the top ten. The biggest loser on the day was Gaudu, who lost over 25 minutes, effectively ending his GC aspirations.\nReferences.\n[[Category:2021 Tour de France]]\n[[Category:Tour de France stages]]"

        "text": "The 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season began on October 2, 2021, and concluded with the NCAA championship on April 9, 2022. This was the 74th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held, and was US college hockey's 128th year overall.\nConference realignment and program suspensions.\nSeven schools that had been members of the men's WCHA made a joint decision to leave and reestablish the CCHA, whose original version had last played in the 2012–13 season. They were joined by St. Thomas, who were raising their athletic programs from Division III. Of the remaining three WCHA men's teams, Alaska would continue as an independent program, Alaska Anchorage would suspend operations until fundraising efforts could determine the future of the team and Alabama–Huntsville would suspend operations until they could secure placement within a conference.\nOn May 26, Robert Morris University announced the termination of both their men's and women's ice hockey teams. The news came as a shock to most, both within and outside the program, and immediately led to fundraising efforts to secure the return of both teams. Despite collecting more than $1 million in donations in under 3 months, the university declared in early August that the team would not be able to participate in the 2021–22 season and would look to return in 2022–23. RMU would announce on December 17, 2021, that both men's and women's teams would resume play in 2023–24.\nOn August 31, Alaska Anchorage announced that the $3 million fundraising goal had been reached and the team would return for the 2022–23 season.\nPairWise Rankings.\nThe PairWise Rankings (PWR) are a statistical tool designed to approximate the process by which the NCAA selection committee decides which teams get at-large bids to the 16-team NCAA tournament. Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division I men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 59 Division I men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 58, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams’ RPI ratings, which starting in 2013-14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison.\nPlayer stats.\nLeading goaltenders.\n&lt;br&gt;\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\""

        "text": "The 2021–22 Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey season is the 54th season of play for the program and the 16th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Falcons represented the United States Air Force Academy and were coached by Frank Serratore, in his 25th season.\nSeason.\nAfter the worst season for the program in 25 years and likely its most trying, Air Force returned to the ice ready to put COVID-19 in the past. At the start, senior netminder and team co-captain, Alex Schilling, got the starting role but didn't perform particularly well. The Falcons got off to a 2–5–1 start with Schilling allowing nearly 5 goals a game on average. Despite the horrid start, Frank Serratore stuck with Schilling and the goals against slowly declined as the team got into its conference schedule.\nA bad stretch at home in November sent the Falcons to the bottom of the Atlantic Hockey standings. While they recovered a bit by taking a series against Canisius, Air Force opened the second half of its season getting swept by American International. Fortunately, the rest of January was kind to the Falcons and they won five of their next six games to pull back into the middle of the pack. The team was up and down in the final month of the regular season and Air Force ended up 6th, guaranteeing them a bye into the conference quarterfinals, but making them do so on the road.\nAir Force began its postseason against their fellow service academy, Army. The first game was a see-saw battle that saw both teams take two 1-goal leads. The Falcon offense opened up on Army's goal, firing 51 shots in nearly 4 periods of work and managed to earn the overtime victory. The second match was just as close with the teams again trading leads but, again, Air Force netted a goal in overtime to sweep the series and make the semifinals. Their match against RIT turned out to be a series of short-lived leads for Air Force as the Tigers tied the game quickly on three separate occasions. Near the mid-point of the third, however, the Falcons finally were able to hold onto their lead and fended RIT off for the final 10 minutes to send the team to the championship game. Air Force's season ended with a thud when the team was completely dominated by AIC, 0–7. The Falcons kept the game close initially, but the team got into penalty trouble, taking 40 minutes worth of infractions, and allowed four power play goals.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Nanooks represented the University of Alaska Fairbanks and were coached by Erik Largen in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAfter the decision to cancel their previous season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Alaska returned to the ice for the first time in 40 years without their long-time rival, Alaska Anchorage. The loss of their most consistent opponent could not have come at a worse time as the Nanooks also found themselves without a conference for the first time since the mid-1990s. The only advantage that Alaska had was that the NCAA still did not count games against schools from Alaska towards a team's limit of games per year. This allowed the Nanooks to insert themselves into the schedule of their opponents on short notice.\nAlaska was rather ambitious with its early-season slate, playing their first 12 games against teams that were ranked for most or all of the season. As a result the Nanooks, who were still trying to build team chemistry, began the year with a terrible 1–12 record. It wasn't until December that the players started to work together consistently, but the early season struggles forged the Nanooks into a unified group.\nAfter winning three consecutive games against Rensselaer, Alaska tied Denver and then defeated Minnesota, both of whom finished the season as top-5 teams. The Nanooks even managed to sweep Arizona State, who had NCAA tournament aspirations, in the midst of a 5-game winning streak. After December 10, Alaska finished their season 12–6–2 and demonstrated a tremendous improvement throughout the year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The following is a list of annual leaders in assists in Major League Baseball (MLB), with separate lists for the American League and the National League. The list also includes several professional leagues and associations that were never part of MLB.\nIn baseball statistics, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) before the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist.\nRabbit Maranville is the all-time leader in assists with 8,967. Frankie Frisch holds the record for most assists in a season with 643 in 1927. Marcus Semien is the active leader in assists and has led the league 4 times."

They represented American International College in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 19th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Yellow Jackets were coached by Eric Lang, in his sixth season, and played their home games at MassMutual Center.\nSeason.\nAIC entered the season looking to continue its run as the Atlantic Hockey champion but didn't get off to a good start. While due in part to the difficulty of their schedule, the Yellow Jackets began with just 3 wins in their first 13 games. While they got solid, if unspectacular, goaltending from both grad transfer Alec Calvaruso and nominal starter Jake Kucharski, American International was let down by its offense. In just 4 of those 13 games, the team managed to score more than 2 goals.\nIn late-November, the offense finally got going and the team went on an extended winning streak as a result. AIC won 11 consecutive games, including a defeat of Connecticut, who ended the season in the top-20. The run shot the Yellow Jackets to the top of the Atlantic Hockey standings, where they remained for the rest of the year. While their winning streak nearly put them into the poll themselves, AIC came back down to earth a bit at the end of the regular season. With their 4th-consecutive Atlantic Hockey title in hand, AIC still had to win the conference tournament in order to make the NCAA Tournament.\nPrior to the start of their postseason, AIC got some unwelcome news when Kucharski went down with an undisclosed injury. Despite missing the conference goaltending champion, American International had a capable backup in Calvaruso and he showed up during the playoffs. Calvaruso won all four games for the Yellow Jackets, posting a 2.00 goals against average. It was, however, Blake Bennett who was the story for AIC; the junior forward scored recorded 10 points during their run, including a hat-trick in the semifinal against Mercyhurst, and was named Tournament MVP.\nAmerican International made its third consecutive appearance in the NCAA championship but, as is typical for Atlantic Hockey, they did so against the #1 seed once again. The team faced Michigan, who boasted one of, if not the, most talent-laden teams in NCAA history. The Yellow Jackets, on the other hand, possessed only one NHL-drafted player and he (Kucharski) was still out due to injury. Early on it appeared that the Wolverines would just roll over AIC when they scored twice in the first 5 minutes of the game. The Yellow Jackets fought back, however, and demonstrated that they weren't to be taken lightly. American International ended up outshooting Michigan 32-31 in the game and scored three goals, but it wasn't enough. Even with the loss, the credible performance showed that AIC could compete with the elite college hockey programs.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Steve Johnson (born March 3, 1966) is an American ice hockey coach and former wing who was an All-American for North Dakota.\nCareer.\nJohnson joined the ice hockey program at North Dakota for the 1984–85 season. He produced modest numbers in his first two campaigns for the Sioux, helping the team to good but unspectacular finishes. The return of Tony Hrkac and the arrival of Ed Belfour changed the team's fortunes and Johnson was a beneficiary. For his junior season, Johnson's scoring production soared and he nearly tripled his career totals. He finished third on the team in scoring and led the Fighting Sioux to a WCHA title. UND won the NCAA Championship that year and ended up with 40 wins, setting a new NCAA record in the process (only 1993 Maine has won more games). Johnson was selected by the Vancouver Canucks in the Supplemental Draft after the season as he was to old to be eligible for the standard NHL Entry Draft.\nSeveral of the stars from the championship team left after 1987 and North Dakota declined the following year, but Johnson got even better. Now captain of the team, Johnson became the focal point for the offense and led the Sioux in scoring. He finished in a three-way tie for the national scoring lead and was in on nearly half of North Dakota's goals for the season (48.9%). He was an All-American and led UND to a third-place finish in the conference tournament.\nAfter graduating, Johnson played two seasons of professional hockey. Though his numbers improved after a trade to the Phoenix Roadrunners, Johnson decided to retire in 1990.\nJohnson transitioned into coaching and got his first prominent role as the head coach for the expansion Fargo-Moorhead Bears in the USHL. The team finished well, ending the season 10 game above .500, but the franchise was dissolved after the season. Johnson didn't remain out of a job for long as he was brought in on another expansion team, the Lincoln Stars, the very next year. In the team's inaugural season, Johnson led them to league championship. He kept the Stars near the top of the league for much of his eleven seasons, winning a second Clark Cup in 2003 and finishing as runner-up in 2000. He resigned after the 2007 season but returned with a third USHL team two years later, taking the Fargo Force to a runner-up finish in 2010.\nAfter a sterling career in junior hockey, Johnson returned to the college ranks as an assistant first for St. Cloud State and then Nebraska–Omaha. Afterwards, he returned home to Grand Forks as the director of youth hockey in the area. In January 2020, Johnson was brought in as the head coach for Minnesota–Crookston when the team revived its dormant program as a club team and mulled over bringing it back to varsity status."

The Falcons represented Bentley University and were coached by Ryan Soderquist, in his 20th season.\nSeason.\nBentley began its season in very good standing, defeating both Ohio State and Boston College in the first few weeks of the season. The Falcons cooled off a bit afterwards but still managed to win a few games as they tried to start out their goaltending situation. They began the year with Nicholas Grabko in goal but he never seemed to be able to put a string of good performances together. Unfortunately, the two other options (Evan Debrouwer and Jason Grande) didn't play any better.\nIn mid-November, Debrouwer got his second shot as the starter and made the most of his opportunity, winning five games in a row to put Bentley near the top of the Atlantic Hockey standings by the mid point of the season.\nAfter the winter break, Bentley had to reschedule several games around an uptick in COVID-19 positive tests that were affecting all of college hockey but seemed to get out of the trouble by the end of January. That was only the beginning of their trouble, however, as goaltending issues sent the Falcons careening towards the bottom of the conference. Debrouwer was never able to regain the form he had shown in November and December and allowed fewer than 3 goals in just two of his next nine games. Neither Grabko nor Grande could provide better support for the team in goal and Bentley ended up stumbling towards the finish. Even when their goaltenders were able to limit teams to just a few goals, the Falcons' offense went missing and Bentley finished the regular season with and 11-game winless streak.\nThey opened the postseason on the road against Niagara and completely reversed course, winning two matches to both end their streak and move onto the conference quarterfinals. The team's low position, however, sent them into a match with top-seeded American International and the Falcons were routed in back-to-back games.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

They represented Boston University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 38th season in the Hockey East conference. The Terriers were coached by Albie O'Connell, in his fourth season, and played their home games at Agganis Arena.\nSeason.\nBU entered the season with a great deal of hope after making the NCAA tournament despite having to cancel several games as a result of COVID-19. The Terriers received a top 10 ranking in the preseason polls and were expected to compete for the Hockey East championship. When they hit the ice, however, Boston University got off to a terrible start. BU got off to a 3–7 record with their offense struggling mightily in the first month. Despite Drew Commesso playing well in goal, the Terriers scored more than two goals in just three of those contests. By mid-November the team appeared to be rounding into form but were still a middling team in their conference. Ordinarily that might not have been a terrible position to be in, however, Hockey East was having a bad season with a poor non-conference record.\nWhile the first half of their season was disastrous to the Terrier's postseason hopes, their situation went from bad to worse in late December. During the winter break, Tyler Boucher left the team and signed a professional contract with the Ottawa Senators. In spite of losing their top prospect, however, BU came out guns blazing in the second half and won seven of their next eight games.\nThe winning streak was put in jeopardy when Commesso was selected to be a member of the United States national team at the 2022 Winter Olympics. The team rallied around backup Vinny Duplessis, however, and continued to pile up wins. Boston University went so far as to knock off Northeastern in the Beanpot championship, capturing their first title in seven years.\nCommesso returned to campus at the end of February found his team with a top-15 ranking and a near-lock for the NCAA tournament. Unfortunately, the team faltered at the very end of the season and lost two of their last three regular season games. The defeats pushed BU down to 5th-place in the standings and below the cutoff line for at-large bids. The Terriers still had a chance to win their way into the tournament but they would need a good showing in the Hockey East playoffs. In their quarterfinal match, BU took on Connecticut and were stymied by a stellar performance from Darion Hanson. The 1–3 loss ended the Terriers' once promising season.\nAfter the year, head coach Albie O'Connell was fired after having made the NCAA tournament just once in his four years behind the bench.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nThe Big Red began practicing in mid December with six games on their slate. In spite of the unpredictable nature of the weather, most of Cornell's game were scheduled to take place at Ithaca. With captain Tilton and Edminster forming the backbone of the team, the roster was compiled in early January and many of the players were familiar faces. One new arrival came in goal, Nash, necessitated by last year's starter having graduated. The team performed well in their first game with Tilton earning the game-winner with less than 3 minutes remaining.\nThere was considerable improvement in the team over the course of the following week, but their next opponent, Dartmouth was a very strong outfit. The Indians ended up proving that with a 12–1 demolition, including 6 goals in the first. Tilton's goal was one of the few bright lights for the squad and, despite the score, Nash was credited with solid play in net. The next game for the team was much closer but still resulted in a loss. Boston University kept the Big Red from scoring a single goal and recorded their only tally of the game in the waning minutes. The defeat left a foul taste in the team's mouth over the examination break and they were champing at the bit by early February.\nWilliams was next and coach Bawlf made several changed to the lineup. Ayers, a new entry, was put in as a starter on defense while Hoyt, now eligible in the new term, replaced Cooke at Left Wing. The new arrangement saw Cornell produce its biggest offensive output but the Ephs were able to use a fast start to say ahead of the Ithacans and win the match. The team continued its run of 1-goal losses against Princeton before finally winning its second game of the season to end the year. The final match was the first between Cornell and nearby Syracuse University on the ice and the Big Red earned their first shutout in over 3 years.\nTilton led the team with 7 goals.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "History of professional baseball in Nashville, Tennessee",
        "text": "Nashville, Tennessee, has hosted Minor League Baseball (MiLB) teams since the late 19th century but has never been home to a Major League Baseball (MLB) team. The city's professional baseball history dates back to 1884 with the formation of the Nashville Americans, who were charter members of the original Southern League in 1885 and played their home games at Sulphur Spring Park, later renamed Athletic Park and Sulphur Dell. This ballpark was the home of Nashville's minor league teams through 1963. Of the numerous clubs to play there, the best-known and longest-operating was the Nashville Vols, who competed from 1901 to 1963, primarily in the Southern Association.\nFollowing the loss of the Vols and the subsequent demolition of Sulphur Dell, Music City was without a professional baseball team for 14 years until 1978 when the Nashville Sounds, then a Double-A team that moved up to Triple-A in 1985, began play at Herschel Greer Stadium. The Sounds left Greer in 2015 for First Tennessee Park, now known as First Horizon Park, a new facility built on the site of the historic Sulphur Dell, where they continue as the oldest active professional sports franchise in Nashville.\nSeveral Negro league teams were also based in Nashville, playing at Sulphur Dell as well as Greenwood Park and Tom Wilson Park, from 1920 to 1951. Among these were the Nashville Elite Giants, who played 15 seasons in the city, including six seasons in leagues that were retroactively granted major league status by MLB in 2020.\nDespite efforts to bring Major League Baseball to Nashville, most prominently in the 1993 MLB expansion process, the city has been unsuccessful in its attempts to gain a major league team. An effort is being made to either land a future expansion team or lure an existing team to Nashville with the promise of a new major league facility.\nMinor League Baseball.\nEarly teams (1884–1897).\nAmateur teams first played baseball in Nashville, Tennessee, in the late 1860s. On October 6, 1884, local investors met to establish the city's first professional baseball team, the Nashville Americans. Following a failed bid to join the major league Union Association, the Americans instead became charter members of the original Southern League, in which they competed in 1885 and 1886. They played their home games at Sulphur Spring Park, later renamed Athletic Park and Sulphur Dell, which was the home of the city's minor league teams through 1963.\nNashville's Southern League entry in 1887 was called the Nashville Blues. After losing nearly US$18,000, the team's directors chose to cut their losses and withdraw from the circuit some two months before the season's end. Nashville did not field another professional baseball club for the next five years until the Nashville Tigers joined the Southern League in 1893. The Tigers faced similar financial difficulties and surrendered the franchise to the league, which continued to operate it for the last three weeks of the season. Their 1894 campaign came to an abrupt midseason end as the result of league-wide financial instability.\nThe Nashville Seraphs replaced the Tigers in 1895. The Seraphs and Atlanta Crackers ended the season tied for first place, and each asserted to be the rightful pennant winners. At the Southern League's annual winter meeting that December, nearly four months later, Nashville was declared the champion for 1895. Despite winning the city's first professional baseball title, the Seraphs declined to participate in 1896 when another of the league's club refused to put up its monetary guarantee to finish the season. Two years later, in 1897, the Nashville Centennials were formed as members of the Central League. Financial problems necessitated the team's transfer to Henderson, Kentucky, just over a month into the season, and the league collapsed shortly thereafter.\nVols (1901–1963).\nThe Nashville Vols, the city's longest-operating baseball team, played 62 seasons from 1901 to 1963. First known only as the Nashville Baseball Club, they were formed as a charter member of the newly organized Southern Association in 1901. The team did not receive its official moniker, the Nashville Volunteers (regularly shortened to Vols), until 1908. Their last season in the Southern Association was 1961. They were inactive in 1962 due to the Southern Association ceasing operations after the 1961 season and their inability to obtain a major league working agreement required for membership in another league. Nashville returned for a final campaign as a part of the South Atlantic League in 1963 before financial problems resulted in the board of directors surrendering the franchise to the league.\nThe Vols were affiliated with six Major League Baseball teams across 27 seasons and were unaffiliated in the other 35. Their longest affiliation was with the Chicago Cubs for nine seasons (1943–1951), followed by the Cincinnati Reds (8 seasons; 1936–1937, 1955–1960), New York Giants (5 seasons; 1934–1935, 1952–1954), Brooklyn Dodgers (3 seasons; 1938–1940), and one season each with the Minnesota Twins (1961) and Los Angeles Angels (1963). The Vols won eight Southern Association pennants (1901, 1902, 1908, 1916, 1940, 1943, 1948, 1949), nine playoff championships (1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1949, 1950, 1953), and four Dixie Series titles (1940, 1941, 1942, 1949).\nSounds (1978–present).\nMusic City was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the loss of the Vols. That changed in 1978 when Larry Schmittou and a group of investors purchased the rights to operate an expansion franchise of the Double-A Southern League called the Nashville Sounds. The Sounds played their home games at Herschel Greer Stadium, a new ballpark located on the grounds of Fort Negley. Nashville led all of Minor League Baseball in attendance in their inaugural season and continued to draw the Southern League's largest crowds in each of their seven years as members of the league. The Sounds had affiliations with the Cincinnati Reds (1978–1979) and New York Yankees (1980–1984). The team won six consecutive second-half division titles from 1979 to 1984 and won the Southern League championship in 1979 and 1982.\nIn an effort to position Nashville to contend for an MLB franchise in the future, Schmittou and team owners purchased the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association and relocated the team to Nashville before the 1985 season. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded them. They rarely contended for the American Association championship, making only three appearances in the postseason over their 13 years in the league. During this period, Nashville was affiliated with the Detroit Tigers (1985–1986), Cincinnati Reds (1987–1992), and Chicago White Sox (1993–1997).\nThe Sounds became members of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 following the dissolution of the American Association after the end of the previous season. They were affiliates of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1998–2004), Milwaukee Brewers (2005–2014), Oakland Athletics (2015–2018), and Texas Rangers (2019–2020). Over 23 years in the league, the team qualified for the playoffs on five occasions. They won their lone Pacific Coast League championship in 2005. The Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2015 for First Horizon Park, then known as First Tennessee Park, a new facility built on the site of the former Sulphur Dell in downtown Nashville.\nIn conjunction with Major League Baseball's reorganization of the minor leagues in 2021, Nashville was placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. They have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers since 2021. Nashville has made one appearance in the International League playoffs but has not won its championship. The Sounds are the oldest active professional sports franchise in Nashville, predating the Nashville Predators (1998), Tennessee Titans (1999), and Nashville SC (2018).\nXpress (1993–1994).\nNashville hosted two minor league teams during 1993 and 1994 seasons as the city became a temporary home to the Nashville Xpress, a displaced Southern League team previously known as the Charlotte Knights. This came about after the 1992 season when Charlotte, North Carolina, acquired a Triple-A expansion team in the International League, leaving the Southern League franchise in need of a new home. Larry Schmittou, president of the Triple-A Nashville club, offered to let the displaced team play at Greer Stadium until a permanent home could be found. Schmittou and the Sounds' staff served as caretakers of the team, which was the Double-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. To accommodate an additional club at Greer, the Xpress' home games were scheduled for during the Sounds' road trips. They left Nashville to play on an interim basis in Wilmington, North Carolina, where they were known as the Port City Roosters in 1995 and 1996. The franchise eventually landed in Mobile, Alabama, as the Mobile BayBears in 1997.\nNegro leagues.\nSeveral Negro league baseball teams hailed from Nashville between 1920 and 1951. The first such club was the Nashville White Sox, who were charter members of the Negro Southern League (NSL) in 1920. They played their home games at Sulphur Dell.\nPerhaps Nashville's best-known Negro team was the Nashville Elite Giants, who played in the city from 1921 to 1935 as members of the Negro Southern League (1921–1923, 1926–1927, 1929, 1931–1932) and Negro National League (NNL) (1930, 1933–1935), and also operated independently (1924–1925, 1928). The Elites played at Sulphur Dell, Greenwood Park, and Tom Wilson Park, built by team owner Thomas T. Wilson in 1929. Wilson relocated the team to Columbus, Ohio, during the 1935 season, becoming the Columbus Elite Giants. While in Nashville, the team won four Negro Southern League championships (1921, 1922, 1929, 1931). In 2020, Major League Baseball retroactively granted major league status to the NNL and NSL for certain seasons, elevating the Elite Giants to a major league team in 1929 (as associate members of the NNL), 1930, and from 1932 to 1935.\nThe city was home to the Nashville Stars of the Negro Major League in 1942. This team, or another bearing the same name, also competed in the NSL in 1950 and 1951 at Sulphur Dell. Finally, the Nashville Black Vols began playing at the Dell in 1945 as members of the NSL. They became known as the Nashville Cubs in 1946 and split part of the 1950 season between Nashville and Louisville, Kentucky, where they competed as the Louisville Cubs, before playing their final season in 1951.\nMajor League Baseball.\nThough several attempts have been made to either secure membership in a major league or earn a Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion franchise, Nashville has never had an MLB team.\n1885 Union Association.\nThe Union Association, one of three major leagues in operation in 1884, considered the Nashville Americans for membership in its 1885 season. On October 10, President Henry Lucas came to Nashville to meet with the team's directors and survey the prospect of major league baseball in the city. That afternoon at the Nashville Fairgrounds, the Americans played their first exhibition game against one of the association's top teams, the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds. The Nashvilles lost both that afternoon's game and a second game the next day. With the possibility of Union Association membership looking dim, the Americans opted instead to join the newly organized Southern League in 1885. The Union Association disbanded before the 1885 season.\n1993 MLB expansion.\nSounds president Larry Schmittou, who was also vice president of marketing and administration for the Texas Rangers, believed in 1983 that Nashville was a viable candidate to land a Major League Baseball team either through expansion or the relocation of an existing franchise.\nIn November 1985, a delegation from Nashville was one of 12 groups to make presentations to MLB owners and commissioner Peter Ueberroth regarding the viability of expansion in their cities. The delegation, which included Schmittou, Governor Lamar Alexander, and Mayor Richard Fulton, were encouraged with their reception but were concerned that people may not know Nashville well enough to make it a strong contender. The Governor's Commission on Major League Baseball entrusted Schmittou and other Sounds owners, including country musicians Conway Twitty, Larry Gatlin, Richard Sterban, Jerry Reed, and Cal Smith, with ownership of a potential franchise and responsibility for the financial requirement set forth by the expansion committee. Schmittou launched a drive to pre-sell 10,000 season tickets, which was met and exceeded.\nIn June 1990, MLB announced its intentions to add two new National League teams in a 1993 expansion. Joining Nashville in competition for these two spots were Buffalo, New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Colorado; Miami, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Sacramento, California; St. Petersburg, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Washington, D.C. Schmittou gave a formal presentation to the National League Expansion Committee in September 1990. His plan for MLB in Nashville included a proposed $40-million ballpark to be built at the convergence of Interstate 24 and Briley Parkway that would have included a scoreboard shaped like the neck of a guitar and seated 40,000 people. Along with the submission of a 120-page proposal, the committee was shown a video narrated by Country Music Hall of Fame member Eddy Arnold, which extolled the suitability of Nashville for a major league team. On December 18, the committee released a short list of six finalist candidates—Nashville was not included on the list. The two new franchises were eventually awarded to Denver (the Colorado Rockies) and Miami (the Florida Marlins).\n1998 MLB expansion.\nAfter the failed 1993 expansion bid, Schmittou felt that the lack of a major league stadium significantly hurt Nashville's MLB viability. He intended to reapply in the next round of expansion if a plan for a stadium was in place. Having no such plan for a ballpark by the August 11, 1994, deadline for application for the 1998 MLB expansion, Schmittou did not apply. The Nashville Sports Council requested an application from the expansion committee but did not complete and return the packet. Franchises were awarded to Phoenix (the Arizona Diamondbacks) and Tampa Bay (the Tampa Bay Devil Rays).\nFuture expansion.\nThough Major League Baseball has not announced plans regarding future expansion, Nashville has been one of several cities mentioned by commissioner Rob Manfred as potential locations for expansion when it should happen.\nIn January 2019, businessman John Loar announced plans to spearhead the next attempt at bringing an MLB expansion franchise to Nashville. He subsequently formed Music City Baseball to pursue this plan. The group includes Loar, former United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Vanderbilt Commodores baseball head coach Tim Corbin, retired MLB pitcher Dave Stewart, manager Tony La Russa, executive Dave Dombrowski, musicians Justin Timberlake and Darius Rucker, and former Tennessee Titan Eddie George. In April 2022, Stewart was appointed to lead Music City Baseball.\nKey difficulties facing the proposal include a lack of capital funds to build a ballpark and pay an MLB enfranchisement fee, obtaining the land on which to build as former Mayor John Cooper said the city would not pay for the facility, and the presence of the Nashville Sounds. The Nashville baseball territory is controlled by the Sounds, so Music City Baseball would have to buy them out. Sounds co-owner Frank Ward has said he would relocate his team if MLB came to Nashville rather than try to coexist in the same market. This leads to the problem of what to do with the Sounds' First Horizon Park, which is owned by the city and will not be paid off until 2043.\nMusic City Baseball is considering the campus of Tennessee State University in West Nashville as a potential stadium location. If an expansion team was awarded to the group, it would be called the Nashville Stars in homage to the Negro leagues and the team of the same name that hailed from Nashville. The group entered into a licensing agreement with the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, which includes revenue sharing, a potential physical location in their ballpark, and the rights to use the Stars' name and related photographs and artifacts."

        "text": "The 2021 Vuelta a España was the 76th edition of Vuelta a España, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Vuelta began in Burgos on 14 August, and Stage 11 from Antequera to Valdepeñas de Jaén occurred on 25 August. The race finished in Santiago de Compostela on 5 September.\nStage 1.\nThe Vuelta began with a individual time trial in Burgos. Immediately from the start at Burgos Cathedral, the riders began to go uphill before tackling the third-category Alto del Castillo, a climb with an average gradient of 7.1 percent. The quickest rider at the top took the first blue polka-dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification. Afterwards, the riders took on a descent before a flat section as the riders looped back towards the finish at the cathedral.\nThe first rider to set a benchmark time was the thirteenth rider to start, Omar Fraile (), who, with a time of 8' 55\", was the first rider to finish under nine minutes. Shortly after, Adam Yates () beat Fraile's time, going three seconds quicker. Several riders threatened Yates' time before his teammate, Dylan van Baarle, went nine seconds quicker with a time of 8' 43\". His time stood until Alex Aranburu () finished with a time of 8' 38\", five seconds faster than van Baarle. Aranburu stayed in the hot seat for a long time as multiple riders went faster than him on the climb before eventually falling short by the finish. Jan Tratnik (), Tom Scully (), and Josef Černý () came closest to beating Aranburu's time but they fell short by two to four seconds. The last rider off the start ramp was the two-time defending champion, Primož Roglič (). With a time of 8' 32\", Roglič knocked Aranburu off the hot seat by six seconds to win the stage. In doing so, Roglič took the red and green jerseys as the first leader of the general and points classifications. Roglič's teammate, Sepp Kuss, set the fastest time atop the Alto del Castillo to take the blue polka-dot jersey while Andrea Bagioli (), who finished seventh, took the white jersey as the best young rider.\nIn the battle amongst the other GC favorites, Aleksandr Vlasov () was the closest rider to Roglič at 14 seconds down. Romain Bardet () and Enric Mas () finished 17 and 18 seconds behind, respectively, while the other contenders lost between 20 and 40 seconds.\nStage 2.\nThe second stage of the Vuelta featured a course with an almost entirely flat terrain that suited the sprinters. There were no categorized climbs on the route apart from a few minor lumps on the course. With to go, there was an intermediate sprint at Tardajos that offered three, two, and one bonus second(s) to the first three riders across, respectively.\nAs soon as the flag dropped, three riders, Diego Rubio (), Sergio Martín (), and Xabier Azparren (), broke away from the peloton. The trio built a maximum advantage of around four minutes before and began to control the gap for their sprinters, Arnaud Démare and Fabio Jakobsen, respectively. The gap gradually came down before the pace in the peloton rapidly increased with around to go as they rode into exposed roads. The trio's advantage came down to around 33 seconds before the peloton knocked off the pace, allowing the break's lead to increase again to more than a minute and a half. With around to go, the break split as Rubio soloed off the front before he was caught by the peloton with left; for his efforts, he was awarded the stage's combativity award.\nAlmost immediately, came to the front in an attempt to bring Alex Aranburu closer to the red jersey with the bonus seconds at the intermediate sprint. At the sprint, Aranburu was led out by his team, but Jakobsen came across first with Aranburu in second. With to go, a crash took down some riders in the middle of the peloton. The crash caught some contenders out, including Adam Yates (), Hugh Carthy (), and David de la Cruz (), with all three losing 30 seconds to a minute. In the final sprint to the line, Juan Sebastián Molano () launched his sprint first but Jasper Philipsen () came around him to win the stage. Second place went to Jakobsen, who was forced to take a longer route around Molano and the third-place finisher was Michael Matthews (). With his win, Philipsen also took the lead in the points classification. Primož Roglič () finished safely in the peloton to retain the red jersey.\nAfter the stage, Alexander Cataford (), who had gone down in the late crash, was diagnosed with a broken collarbone. As a result, he was unable to start stage 3 and became the first withdrawal of the race.\nStage 3.\nThe third stage featured the first summit finish of the race as the riders headed from Santo Domingo de Silos to Picón Blanco. The first was undulating and included the third-category climb of Puerto del Manquillo, which crested after . Afterwards, the terrain was mostly flat until the riders passed through the intermediate sprint in Medina de Pomar with left. With to go, the riders tackled the third-category Alto de Bocos, a climb with an average gradient of 6.3 percent. There were bonus seconds on offer for the first three riders to cross the summit. After passing through Espinosa de los Monteros, the riders reached the foot of the final climb of Picón Blanco, a long first-category climb with an average gradient of 9.3 percent.\nBefore the stage started, Frederik Frison () became the second rider to abandon after suffering from a high fever; the Belgian rider's COVID-19 tests had all come back negative. A few kilometres after the flag dropped, Ryan Gibbons () attempted to break away together with Antonio Jesús Soto (). After the two were brought back, Soto tried to break away again and this time, he was joined by seven other riders. The eight-man break extended their lead to three minutes before took control at the front of the peloton. At the top of the Puerto del Manquillo, Kenny Elissonde () took maximum points to tie Sepp Kuss () for the lead of the mountains classification. Over the next few kilometres, the break's advantage ballooned to nine minutes, making it almost certain that the someone from the break would win the stage. At the intermediate sprint, Julen Amezqueta () took maximum points. With other teams taking over at the front, the peloton began to set a furious pace, bringing the break's lead down to about four minutes. At the top of the Alto de Bocos, Tobias Bayer () took maximum points, which, when added to the points he had previously accumulated in the stage, catapulted him to the top of the virtual KOM standings.\nWith to go, Lilian Calmejane () attacked off the front, building an advantage of 20 seconds before being chased down ahead of the final climb of Picón Blanco. At the bottom of the climb, the break began to split apart, with Amezqueta, Calmejane, Elissonde, Joe Dombrowski (), and Rein Taaramäe () remaining up front. from the top, Dombrowski upped the pace in the break, bringing only Taaramäe and Elissonde with him. Further up the climb, Taaramäe dropped his companions, eventually soloing to the stage win. Dombrowski took second, 21 seconds down, while Elissonde finished 36 seconds behind. In the GC group, set a steady tempo on the final climb. David de la Cruz () attacked but he was unable to build a gap. After losing time the previous day, Adam Yates () put in a few digs but the headwind on the climb made it hard for the riders to create any gaps. Near the finish, Enric Mas () accelerated from the group, gaining three seconds on a seven-man group of favourites. With the GC group crossing the line at almost two minutes behind Taaramäe, the Estonian became the new race leader and took the red jersey from Primož Roglič (). With the 10 points Taaramäe took at the summit of Picón Blanco, he also became the new leader of the mountains classification and took the blue polka-dot jersey.\nSome contenders lost contact with the GC group towards the top. De la Cruz lost 15 seconds to Mas while Hugh Carthy () conceded more than 20 seconds. Romain Bardet (), Aleksandr Vlasov (), and Damiano Caruso () conceded 32 seconds to Mas while Richard Carapaz () struggled and lost a minute. Additionally, Carapaz was handed a 20-second penalty for taking a feed out of the authorized zone.\nStage 4.\nStage 4 covered from El Burgo de Osma to Molina de Aragón, travelling southeast through central Spain and leaving Castile and León. The undulating route had several hills but no categorised climbs, and it was expected to favour the sprinters. The only point of note along the stage was the intermediate sprint after of racing, at the top of a small rise in Alcolea del Pinar; bonus seconds were also on offer for the first three riders to cross the sprint line. The final began with a false flat up to to go before a short descent into the final kilometre. The road then flattened out before a uphill drag to the line with gradients between three and seven percent.\nRight from the start, a breakaway of three was formed. This trio consisted of three Spaniards, with Joan Bou () being joined by the duo of Ángel Madrazo and Carlos Canal; Canal was the youngest rider in the race at 20 years and 50 days. The breakaway quickly built an advantage of almost three minutes, but at around in, it had increased to a maximum of about four and a half minutes. At that point, the peloton began to close the gap ahead of the intermediate sprint, where Bou took maximum points ahead of Madrazo in second and Canal in third. In the peloton behind, Florian Sénéchal () took fourth ahead of the points classification leader, Jasper Philipsen (), to limit the losses for his teammate Fabio Jakobsen; Philipsen and Jakobsen were tied for the lead in that classification, with the former wearing the leader's green jersey by virtue of his stage 2 victory. The peloton gradually chased down the break before the trio was swept up with to go, and among them, Madrazo was awarded the stage's combativity award. With to go, race leader Rein Taaramäe () went down near the back of the peloton, but he was able to get back up quickly. At the front of the peloton, , , and took control for their respective sprinters. In the finale, Sacha Modolo () was the first to begin sprinting while looking behind for his teammate Philipsen, who was boxed in behind other sprinters. On the uphill sprint to the line, led out their sprinter, Arnaud Démare, before Jakobsen emerged from his wheel in the final to win the stage on the line. With the 50 points he gained at the finish, Jakobsen also took the lead in the points classification. Magnus Cort () finished third, while Philipsen settled for ninth.\nBecause Taaramäe's crash occurred in the final , he was credited with the same time as the peloton, thus retaining the red jersey and the lead in the general classification. The rest of the top 10 in the GC remained unchanged as everyone finished in the peloton.\nStage 5.\nThe fifth stage of the race took the riders from Tarancón to Albacete with another stage that was expected to suit the sprinters, with the mostly flat route having no categorised climbs. The intermediate sprint took place in La Roda with to go and offered bonus seconds to the first three riders across.\nAs soon as the flag dropped, Xabier Azparren (), Pelayo Sánchez (), and Oier Lazkano () broke away from the peloton. The trio extended their lead to as much as seven minutes with taking control of the peloton. , , and soon brought riders to the front as the gap began to decrease. At the intermediate sprint, Lazkano took maximum points with Sánchez in second and Azparren in third. In the peloton, Jasper Philipsen () sprinted ahead of Arnaud Démare () to edge closer to Fabio Jakobsen's () lead in the points classification. Sánchez was the first rider from the break to get dropped, and he was followed soon after by Azparren; this left only Lazkano out front, who would take the stage's combativity award.\nThe race soon headed inside the final where there was a threat of crosswinds. Several teams tried to split the peloton into echelons but the wind was not strong enough to cause such splits. Lazkano was swept up by the peloton with left. Around from the finish, a big crash brought down several riders; chief among them were Romain Bardet () and the race leader, Rein Taaramäe (). All riders who crashed would eventually get back up. In the final sprint to the line, Philipsen was led out by his team as he took his second stage of the race ahead of Jakobsen. With the points he gained, Philipsen took the lead in the points classification by a solitary point. Taaramäe finished more than two minutes down while Bardet lost 12 minutes, dropping him out of GC contention. As a result of the former's time loss, second-placed Kenny Elissonde () became the new race leader and took the red jersey.\nStage 6.\nStage 6 featured a route from Requena to Cullera that finished atop the third-category climb of the Alto de la Montaña de Cullera. The first featured several short uncategorised climbs but were net downhill as the riders headed east towards Valencia and the Mediterranean coast. Once there, the route then turned south along the coast, with an intermediate sprint after in Pinedo on the Valencian outskirts, with bonus seconds also on offer for the first three riders across. The rest of the stage was almost entirely pan-flat until the final when riders reached the foot of the finishing climb. The Alto de la Montaña de Cullera proper started at to go, with an average gradient of 9.4 percent.\nSeveral riders attempted to get into the breakaway but no one was able to get away for the first of the stage. The first riders to build a gap were Joan Bou () and Ryan Gibbons (). A three-man chase group of Jetse Bol (), Magnus Cort (), and Bert-Jan Lindeman () managed to bridge up to the duo and the peloton was content to let the quintet go. Guy Niv () also attempted to join the break unsuccessfully and he rejoined the peloton shortly thereafter. The quintet led by as much as seven minutes before began to chase from the peloton. At the intermediate sprint, Bol took maximum points while the peloton passed through at around three and a half minutes down. With around to go, echelons began to form in the peloton as the wind picked up. Most of the contenders made it to the front with the exception of Adam Yates () and Hugh Carthy () while the race leader, Kenny Elissonde (), was also among those caught out. The peloton would eventually reform with to go.\n from the finish, Carthy was dropped off the back of the peloton. He found himself almost 30 seconds behind at one point but with the help of his teammates, he managed to get back with around to go. With and chasing in the peloton, the break started the final climb with a lead of only 20 seconds. Near the bottom of the climb, Elissonde was dropped by the peloton. The lead quintet began to split on the climb, with Cort emerging as the strongest from the break as he soloed off the front. Inside the final , Michael Matthews () attacked from the peloton, followed immediately by Aleksandr Vlasov (). After Matthews and Vlasov were caught, Primož Roglič () kicked clear with Andrea Bagioli () close behind, but Cort held off Roglič on the line to take the stage win.\nVlasov and Enric Mas () finished four seconds down while Egan Bernal () and the duo of Miguel Ángel López and Alejandro Valverde finished almost ten seconds down. Yates, David de la Cruz (), and Giulio Ciccone () conceded more than 20 seconds while a group containing Fabio Aru (), Mikel Landa (), and Richard Carapaz () lost 27 seconds. Carthy suffered the most and conceded almost three minutes. With Elissonde finishing four and a half minutes back, Roglič took back the red jersey, while the trio of Mas, López, and Valverde moved into second to fourth, respectively. Bernal rounded out the top five on the same time as Valverde.\nStage 7.\nThe seventh stage featured another uphill finish as the riders travelled from Gandia to Balcón de Alicante. The stage featured six categorized climbs with the first of these, the first-category Puerto La Llacuna, coming after just . The climb was long with an average gradient of 6.2 percent.

A descent and a short uphill section led to the intermediate sprint in Relleu with left to race. The sprint was followed immediately by the second-category Puerto El Collao, a climb with an average gradient of 4.6 percent. After the descent, the riders headed to the third-category Puerto de Tibi, a climb with an average gradient of 5.3 percent. The top, crested with to go, offered bonus seconds to the first three riders across. Another short descent led to the final climb of the day, the first-category Balcón de Alicante, an climb with an average gradient of 6.2 percent. The final featured gradients of over 10 percent while the finish line came after a short downhill section at the top.\nAs soon as the flag dropped, a group of seven riders tried to pull away but they were caught at the bottom of the first climb. Several riders attacked on the climb but no one was able to build a gap over the peloton. Near the top, the peloton split into three groups, with most of the contenders included in the second group. The only exception was Hugh Carthy (), who was dropped on the steep part of the climb; he would eventually abandon the race. At the top, Jack Haig () took maximum points to tie with Rein Taaramäe () at the top of the KOM standings. The GC group bridged up to the front group on the descent, prompting more riders to go on the attack. It was not until a group of six riders broke away with around to go that the GC group began to settle down. The easing of the pace allowed some dropped riders to get back to the GC group. However, , having missed the break, began to chase with Matteo Trentin. His pace took 22 other riders with him, splitting themselves from the group of favourites. The chase group bridged up to the front with left to make it 29 riders in the break.\nOver the next two climbs, Romain Bardet () and Jan Polanc () took maximum points for the KOM while set a steady pace in the peloton. On the climb of Puerto El Collao, the duo of Chris Hamilton and Michael Storer launched separate attacks from the break but they were both caught. At the top, Bardet took maximum points to take the lead in the KOM competition. On the descent, Lawson Craddock () pulled away from the break before eventually being caught by Storer and Pavel Sivakov (). On the climb of Puerto de Tibi, Sivakov dropped his chain while Storer dropped Craddock. Sivakov eventually made his way back to Storer on the climb while Craddock made his way back on the descent. On the final climb of the day, Craddock was dropped for good while Carlos Verona () and Andreas Kron () made their way up front. With to go, Verona accelerated, dropping Kron while Storer and Sivakov slowly made their way back. from the finish, Storer attacked, dropping both Sivakov and Verona. He gradually built his lead to solo to the stage win. Verona dropped Sivakov to finish second while Sivakov held on for third. Sivakov did, however, take the blue polka-dot jersey as leader of the KOM competition.\nMeanwhile, in the GC group, was content to let the break go. On the Puerto El Collao, Alejandro Valverde () launched an attack, followed by the duo of Adam Yates and Richard Carapaz. However, just before the group was caught, Valverde crashed heavily on a bend. He tried to ride on, but he would eventually abandon. Miguel Ángel López () also attacked on the climb, followed by Carapaz and the race leader Primož Roglič (). The move would eventually get shut down. On the final climb, Yates put in a few digs, with Roglič, López, Enric Mas (), Egan Bernal (), David de la Cruz (), and Louis Meintjes () the riders able to stay with him to the finish. Aleksandr Vlasov () lost 13 seconds while a group containing Carapaz, Giulio Ciccone (), Fabio Aru (), and Mikel Landa () conceded half a minute.\nIn the GC, Roglič narrowly held on to the red jersey by eight seconds over Felix Großschartner (), who was in the break. Mas, López, and Bernal were still 25, 36, and 41 seconds down, respectively. Polanc, Haig, and Sepp Kuss () also moved into the top ten after being in the break.\nStage 8.\nThe eighth stage featured another chance for the sprinters as the riders took on a flat stage from Santa Pola to La Manga del Mar Menor. The first part of the stage was mostly flat before the riders passed through the intermediate sprint in Cartagena with left. Afterwards, there were two short uncategorized climbs which offered a chance for the riders to drop the pure sprinters before a flat run-in to the finish.\nThree Spanish riders, Ander Okamika (), Aritz Bagües (), and Mikel Iturria (), attacked at the start of the day. They built a maximum lead of around almost four minutes before and sent riders to the front of the peloton to gradually decrease the break's lead. At the intermediate sprint, Bagües took maximum points with Iturria in second and Okamika in third. In the peloton, Jasper Philipsen () passed through the intermediate sprint ahead of Arnaud Démare () to extend his lead in the points classification. With around to go, set a furious pace in the bunch as they tried to form echelons with the threat of crosswinds. The pace led to the breakaway riders getting swept up, and to the peloton splitting into three groups. The pace eventually eased up, allowing many of the dropped riders to make it back to the front. With to go, Jetse Bol () accelerated off the front but he was quickly brought back by the surging peloton. In the final sprint to the line, Fabio Jakobsen () launched his sprint with left and held off the other sprinters to take his second stage win of the race. Alberto Dainese () crossed the line in second while Philipsen finished third. With his win, Jakobsen took back the green jersey from Philipsen. The top ten remained unchanged as Primož Roglič () kept the red jersey.\nStage 9.\nThe last stage before the first rest day featured another mountainous course, with the riders finishing at the summit of the Alto de Velefique. The first went downhill before the riders gradually climbed towards the second-category Alto de Cuatro Vientos, a climb with an average gradient of 3.8 percent. Following the descent, the riders climbed towards the intermediate sprint in Tijola with still to race. Afterwards, the riders immediately started the first-category climb of Alto Collado Venta Luisa. The climb, which was the longest in this year's Vuelta, is long with an average gradient of 4.4 percent. Towards the top, there was a section which averages 9.2 percent in gradient. The descent led to the foot of the third-category Alto de Castro de Filabres, a long climb with an average gradient of 3.9 percent, with bonus seconds offered to the first three riders over at the top. After the descent, the riders reached the foot of the final climb, the special category Alto de Velefique. The climb, which is long with an average gradient of 6.4 percent, featured sections of over 10 percent gradient for the first before easing to around six to seven percent in the final .\nMultiple riders attempted to break away but the fast pace in the peloton meant that no break was established until to go, when until a group of seven riders went away. That group swelled to 11 after four more riders bridged across. The break built a lead of almost four minutes before set a furious pace on the Alto Collado Venta Luisa. As the break's lead decreased to around a minute, Damiano Caruso () accelerated off the front of the break with to go. Romain Bardet () tried unsuccessfully to bridge up to Caruso as the Italian gradually built his lead over the rest of the break. soon set a steady pace in the peloton, allowing Caruso to extend his lead to two minutes over the peloton at the top of the climb, while the chasing group, which had been reduced to four riders, crossed the top at a minute and a half behind Caruso. Bardet took second at the top to take over the lead in the mountains classification.\nFollowing the descent, Geoffrey Bouchard () attacked from the peloton, eventually bridging up to the chase group composed of Bardet, Julen Amezqueta (), and Rafał Majka (). Just before the penultimate climb of the Alto de Castro de Filabres, Caruso extended his lead over the chasers to two minutes while stopped pulling in the peloton, allowing Caruso's lead over the peloton to balloon to over four minutes. He gradually extended his lead over the chasers over the rest of the stage to solo to the stage win. By taking maximum points at the summit of the Alto de Velefique, Caruso took over the lead in the mountains classification.\nIn the GC group, set a steady pace as they headed towards the foot of the final climb. Around from the top, Mikel Landa () struggled to follow the pace set by , which had taken over again at the front of the peloton; he would eventually lose five minutes by the end of the day. On the climb's steepest section, Adam Yates () accelerated, with Miguel Ángel López () following him. Primož Roglič () soon bridged up to the duo, bringing Egan Bernal () and Enric Mas () with him. After the pace eased for a while, Yates put in a few more digs, splitting the GC group and catching the remnants of the breakaway with the exception of Caruso. Only Roglič and Mas were able to follow his last attack before the duo were able to drop Yates with around to go. Roglič and Mas worked together to extend their lead over a chase group consisting of Yates, Bernal, López, and Jack Haig (). Towards the top, Bernal was dropped from the chase group. At the line, Roglič took second, gapping Mas by a second and gaining two additional bonus seconds. Yates, Haig, and López finished 39 seconds behind Roglič while Bernal, Giulio Ciccone (), and Gino Mäder () crossed the line more than a minute down. In the GC, Roglič extended his lead to 28 seconds over Mas, the only rider within a minute of the Slovenian's lead. López rounded out the podium at 1' 21\" down while Haig moved up to fourth at 1' 42\" behind. Bernal rounded out the top five at 1' 52\" down with his teammate, Yates, a further 15 seconds in arrears.\nStage 10.\nThe tenth stage of the race took the riders from Roquetas de Mar to Rincón de la Victoria. Most of the stage featured rolling terrain with several small uncategorised hills along the way. The intermediate sprint took place in Torre del Mar with to go. from the finish, the riders took on the only categorized climb of the day, the second-category Puerto de Almáchar. The climb was in length with an average gradient of 4.9 percent but the final featured an average gradient of over 9 percent and some sections over 10 percent. At the summit, bonus seconds were on offer for the first three riders to cross, before a technical descent led to the finish in Rincón de la Victoria.\nThe start of the stage featured another furious fight for the break as several riders attempted to pull away. A trio composed of Florian Sénéchal (), Jordi Meeus (), and Jan Tratnik () briefly got away but they were caught after of racing. The pace remained high until a group of 31 riders broke away after more than of racing. The best-placed riders on GC in the break were Odd Christian Eiking () at 9' 10\" down at the start of the day, with Guillaume Martin () a further 29 seconds behind. The large group immediately built their advantage as began to control the peloton. Shortly after passing through the intermediate sprint, Matteo Trentin (), Alex Aranburu (), Jesús Herrada (), and Floris De Tier () attacked from the break. The quartet reached the foot of the Puerto de Almáchar with a lead of almost half a minute.\nOn the climb itself, De Tier tried to attack off the front but was caught by the chasers along with Aranburu, Trentin, and Herrada. Rui Oliveira () was the next to make a move before he was followed by Kenny Elissonde (). Both riders were caught by the other chasers, which had splintered on the climb. Towards the top, Michael Storer () attacked off the front. Clément Champoussin () tried to follow unsuccessfully, while Storer gradually built his gap to around 40 seconds by the summit. On the descent, Champoussin was caught by Eiking, Mauri Vansevenant (), and Dylan van Baarle (). They came to within 20 seconds of catching Storer but the Australian held on to take his second stage win of the race. The first group of chasers finished 22 seconds later.\nIn the GC group, gradually let the break increase their lead to more than 13 minutes, which meant that Eiking was the virtual GC leader for much of the day. On the steepest section of the Puerto de Almáchar, race leader Primož Roglič () accelerated from the group. No one was able to follow him immediately while a group of chasers composed of Jack Haig () and the duo of Enric Mas and Miguel Ángel López formed behind. Roglič's teammate, Sepp Kuss, was also able to follow the chasers before he was eventually dropped. The duo of Egan Bernal and Adam Yates struggled as they were unable to follow the moves, while Roglič led by around 20 seconds over the top of the climb. On the descent, Roglič's rear wheel slipped during a turn, causing him to crash. Though he was immediately able to get back up, his small advantage had evaporated and he was soon caught by Mas, López, and Haig. Near the finish, Kuss, Aleksandr Vlasov (), and Felix Großschartner () managed to bridge up to the quartet. They crossed the line at almost 12 minutes behind Storer while Bernal, Yates, and several other contenders finished a further 37 seconds in arrears. As a result of his time gain over Roglič, Eiking took the red jersey by a margin of 58 seconds over Guillaume Martin, who moved up to second, while Roglič led the rest of the GC contenders at 2' 17\" down.\nStage 11.\nThe eleventh stage featured a hilly stage as the riders headed towards an uphill finish in Valdepeñas de Jaén, which has previously hosted stage finishes in 2010, 2011, and 2013.

The final kilometre had an average gradient of around 9 percent but featured gradients of more than 20 percent.\nBefore the stage started, announced that Jasper Philipsen, who had won two sprint stages and was in contention for the points classification, had withdrawn from the race due to a mild fever. Alex Aranburu () also withdrew following a crash the previous day. After the flag dropped, it took around before a group of five broke away from the peloton. The group contained Edward Planckaert (), Jonathan Lastra (), Magnus Cort (), Joan Bou (), and Harm Vanhoucke (). After the break was formed, , having missed the break, attempted to bring the quintet back but they were unable to do so. The break's lead stabilized to only around two minutes as and kept them on a tight leash. Their advantage hovered between one and two minutes before finally coming down below a minute as the riders neared the Puerto de Locubín.\nOn the climb, Cort dropped his breakaway companions with Vanhoucke hovering between Cort and the chasing peloton. Vanhoucke was caught with around to go before David de la Cruz () attacked later. Cort summitted with a lead of around 20 seconds; behind de la Cruz was caught at the top of the climb by the peloton as mountains classification leader Damiano Caruso made a surge to add three more points to his lead. Cort maintained his advantage on the descent, eventually reaching the final kilometre with a lead of just under 20 seconds.

Near the top, Iturria attacked his breakaway companions, but he was eventually chased back down.\nOn the short valley before the Alto del 14%, the break began to splinter as Maxim Van Gils () went solo off the front, with the peloton closing in at around half a minute down. Jonathan Lastra () attempted to bridge up to Van Gils but both riders were caught by the peloton on the climb. Towards the top of the climb, a quartet of attackers composed of Giulio Ciccone (), Jay Vine (), Romain Bardet (), and Sergio Henao () pulled away from the peloton, building up a lead of half a minute over the peloton at the summit. On the descent, Ion Izagirre () and Matteo Trentin () attempted to bridge up front but they were caught by the -led peloton. The quartet was gradually brought back, with Vine soloing off the front as the catch was being made before the final kilometre; Vine was eventually brought back within the final kilometre. In the final sprint to the line, Jens Keukeleire () led out his sprinter, Magnus Cort, with Andrea Bagioli () on Cort's wheel. Cort held off Bagioli to win his second stage by half a wheel. Michael Matthews () finished third while Trentin finished fourth. The top ten remained unchanged and Odd Christian Eiking () kept the red jersey.\nStage 13.\nThe thirteenth stage featured a flat parcours with rolling terrain that was expected to suit the pure sprinters. At long, this was the longest stage of this year’s Vuelta. There were no categorized climbs on the route, but it featured some minor lumps. The intermediate sprint took place in Don Benito with to go before the finish in Villanueva de la Serena.\nFrom the start, three attackers, Luis Ángel Maté (), Álvaro Cuadros (), and Diego Rubio (), immediately pulled away from the peloton. They quickly increased their advantage to as much as three minutes before the sprinters' teams began to put riders on the front of the peloton to control the break. With around to go, several teams decided to form echelons in the crosswinds, but no GC contender was caught out. The increase in pace dropped the breakaway's advantage to under 20 seconds, but the peloton eventually eased off and the gap increased back up slightly, with the break hovering at around half a minute ahead. The trio would soon be caught with to go. At the intermediate sprint, with no other rider challenging him, points classification leader Fabio Jakobsen () rode off the front to take maximum points with teammate Bert Van Lerberghe following close behind. With several roundabouts in the final , went to the front to set a fast tempo, which caused several splits in the peloton. The train of Josef Černý, Zdeněk Štybar, and Florian Sénéchal continued to push the pace, with only Matteo Trentin () being able to keep up; a small gap had opened up to the next riders on the road, those being Jakobsen, the sprint train, and the duo of Egan Bernal and Tom Pidcock. Right as the lead group entered the final kilometre, Jakobsen was dropped, with the team turning to Sénéchal as their next sprint option. In the final sprint to the line, Alexander Krieger () came around Van Lerberghe to continue the lead out. Sénéchal and Trentin were the only sprinters remaining, and the former held off the latter to win his first Grand Tour stage. Alberto Dainese () came from the rest of the lead group to finish third. Apart from Egan Bernal () gaining five seconds on the other contenders at the finish, the rest of the top ten remained unchanged as Odd Christian Eiking () kept the red jersey for another day.\nStage 14.\nThe race returned to the mountains on the fourteenth stage with another summit finish atop Pico Villuercas. The first of the stage was flat before going uphill towards the third-category Puerto Berzocana, a climb with an average gradient of 5.2 percent.

As , the team of race leader Odd Christian Eiking, set a steady pace in the peloton, the break increased their lead to a maximum of around 10 minutes before stabilizing ahead of the Puerto Berzocana. At the top of the first two climbs, Romain Bardet () sprinted for maximum KOM points to take the virtual lead in the mountains classification ahead of Damiano Caruso (). On the descent, with to go, the break split as Daniel Navarro (), Nicolas Prodhomme (), and Matthew Holmes () attacked off the front. However, a few kilometres later, Holmes suffered a puncture, dropping him from the front. Inside the last , Jay Vine (), who was in the break, came in contact with one of his team's own cars while trying to grab a bidon and crashed, but he eventually got back on his bike. Up front, Prodhomme and Navarro were soon joined by Holmes and Sep Vanmarcke ().\nInside the final , a seven-man group, including Bardet, made contact up front, prompting Prodhomme to launch another attack. Navarro and Vanmarcke tried to bridge up to him but both riders crashed on a curve; both riders would get back up. Prodhomme built his advantage to more than a minute ahead of the final climb of the day. From the chasing group, Navarro, Ryan Gibbons (), and Andrey Zeits () attacked as they chased down Prodhomme. Zeits dropped Navarro and Gibbons on the way to the top, eventually catching Prodhomme with around left. However, Bardet attacked from the chasing group, passing both Prodhomme and Zeits and soloing off the front. Vine and Jesús Herrada () also passed the two riders as they chased Bardet, but the Frenchman gradually increased his lead. Bardet would go on to win the stage, 44 seconds ahead of Herrada and Vine. With his win, Bardet took the lead in the mountains classification with a 19-point buffer over Caruso.\nIn the GC group, were content to let the break increase their lead to more than 14 minutes on the way to Pico Villuercas.

Giulio Ciccone (), who followed Martin’s move, accelerated just as Martin was being caught. After Ciccone was swept up by the peloton, Miguel Ángel López () attacked with left, managing to build a gap over the -led peloton. Inside the final kilometre, Primož Roglič () accelerated from the peloton, immediately followed by Enric Mas (), Egan Bernal (), and Jack Haig (). They came to within four seconds of catching López at the finish line while Adam Yates () lost 12 seconds to Roglič. Despite losing 20 seconds to Roglič at the finish, Eiking retained the red jersey with a reduced lead of 54 seconds over Martin.\nDuring the stage, Richard Carapaz (), who had entered the race as one of the top GC contenders, withdrew after suffering due to fatigue in the high temperatures. After losing time on the first mountainous stage (Stage 3), Carapaz had continued to gradually falter and was 49th on GC at the time of abandonment, almost an hour down on Eiking.\nStage 15.\nThe fifteenth stage featured almost of vertical climbing.

After around , a 25-man group, including GC contenders Sepp Kuss () and David de la Cruz (), pulled away from the peloton. The group built an advantage of nearly three minutes before began to chase at a fast pace. Just before the group was caught, 10 riders from the original break attacked once again. However, several teams in the peloton kept the break in check, with their lead stabilizing at half a minute. Before the group was caught, Magnus Cort () and Pavel Sivakov (), who were part of the 10-man group, accelerated off the front. However, they were also caught by the peloton, with the attacks starting again afterwards. On the first climb of the day, Maxim Van Gils (), Fabio Aru (), and Rafał Majka () managed to build a gap over the peloton. Towards the top, Van Gils was unable to stay with Majka and Aru, dropping back to a group of 20 chasers. At the top, the duo up front built a lead of a minute and a half over the group of chasers and more than three minutes over the peloton.\nAhead of the Puerto de Pedro Bernardo, Michael Storer (), Geoffrey Bouchard (), and Gianluca Brambilla () attacked out of the chasing group.

Majka crossed the top with a 17-second lead over Aru and two minutes over the group of chasers, which had ballooned to 16 riders. On the descent, Aru continued to drift back to the chasing group while Majka maintained his advantage at around two minutes. Ahead of the penultimate climb of Puerto de Mijares, the chasing group split as Bouchard, Arensman, Steven Kruijswijk (), and Carlos Verona () broke away before catching Aru. Kruijswijk dropped his companions on the climb as he chased Majka. The Pole maintained his advantage over Kruijswijk at around a minute and a half over the top of the climb and on the descent. Majka stayed at the front to the end to complete an solo, winning the stage by almost a minute and a half over Kruijswijk. Chris Hamilton (), who was the only other remnant of the break to stay ahead of the peloton, finished more than two minutes down.\nIn the GC group, controlled the peloton for the whole day. On the final climb of the day, Adam Yates () animated the group with a few attacks, with his last attack allowing him to build a gap.

The intermediate sprint took place in Santillana del Mar with left.\nA few kilometres after the stage started, a crash took down some riders, splitting the peloton in the process; all those who crashed would eventually get back up. Giulio Ciccone () was among those who went down while Enric Mas () and Guillaume Martin () were among those caught behind the incident. As the peloton slowed down, four riders, Quinn Simmons (), Stan Dewulf (), Mikel Bizkarra (), and Dimitri Claeys (), broke away, with Jetse Bol () joining them shortly thereafter. The quintet increased their lead to around two minutes before , , and began to pace in the peloton in anticipation for the sprint finish. During the stage, it was announced that Ciccone, Rudy Molard (), and Sep Vanmarcke () abandoned the race due to their crash injuries. On the climb of Alto de Hijas, the pair of Harm Vanhoucke and Maxim Van Gils attacked from the peloton, with Van Gils pacing Vanhoucke up to the break on the descent before dropping back to the peloton.\nWith around to go, set a faster pace at the front of the peloton, splitting the group in two; among those caught out was Fabio Jakobsen (). Jakobsen's group trailed by as much as half a minute, but they would eventually regain contact with left. With around to go, Andreas Kron () attacked from the peloton with the break just 15 seconds ahead, but he was reeled back in quickly. Up front, Dewulf dropped his breakaway companions but he was caught with left. In the final sprint to the line, Jordi Meeus () started his sprint first but Jakobsen, on his 25th birthday, came around him to take his third stage win of the race. Meeus held on to second while Matteo Trentin () sprinted to third. All the contenders finished safely in the peloton as Odd Christian Eiking () retained the red jersey ahead of two difficult mountain stages.\nStage 17.\nThe seventeenth stage was the first of two consecutive mountain stages considered to be decisive in the battle for the red jersey and the overall victory. After of mostly flat roads, the climbing began with the third-category Altu de Hortigueru, which is long with an average gradient of 4.7 percent. Following a long valley section, the riders reached the foot of the first-category , which is climbed twice on the stage. The climb is long with an average gradient of 9.3 percent. The two passages were separated by a valley section as the riders looped back towards the foot of the climb. Bonus seconds were on offer at the top of the second ascent. Following a descent and another long valley section, the riders reached the intermediate sprint in Cangas de Onís with left. Afterwards, the riders tackled the final climb, the special category Lagos de Covadonga. The climb averages 6.9 percent in gradient over but the first averages 9 percent. Towards the top, there is a short descent before a 7.3 percent section followed by another short descent and a 5 percent uphill section towards the finish line.\nAt the start of the stage, there was a big fight for the break as several riders attempted to pull away. It would take more than before a 15-man group, including David de la Cruz () broke away from the peloton on the first ascent of La Collada Llomena. The front group would soon be joined by Mikel Landa (). The break built their lead to a minute at the top, where Michael Storer () took the maximum KOM points. Meanwhile, in the peloton, race leader Odd Christian Eiking () was dropped near the top before catching back up on the descent. Over the first descent of La Collada Llomena, Olivier Le Gac () accelerated from the breakaway. The remaining remnants of the break were eventually caught by the -led peloton, which kept the break on a tight leash, while Le Gac was caught by the peloton with left to the top of the second ascent of La Collada Llomena. \n soon took to the front of the peloton to set a fast pace, which thinned out the group and dropped several riders, including Eiking. With to go, Egan Bernal () launched an attack, followed immediately by Primož Roglič (). Miguel Ángel López () attempted to follow the move but he soon dropped back to the group with the other contenders, which was being led by . Bernal and Roglič crossed the top with a lead of almost a minute over the chasers with Eiking at more than a minute and a half down. On the descent, several riders crashed, including Eiking and Aleksandr Vlasov (); all riders were able to continue the race. The duo up front began to work together on the valley section, increasing their gap to more than two minutes over the chasers. However, gradually reduced the duo's lead on the valley section, with Roglič and Bernal starting the climb of Lagos de Covadonga with a lead of a minute and a half.\nAround into the climb, Guillaume Martin (), who was sitting in second in the GC, was unable to follow the pace set by in the chase group. Up front, from the top, Roglič managed to drop Bernal. He gradually increased his lead towards the top, eventually soloing to his third stage win and the red jersey. Meanwhile, the chase group gradually thinned out on the climb until it was down to just six riders, including Roglič's closest rivals as well as his teammate, Sepp Kuss, and Gino Mäder (). López and his teammate, Enric Mas, launched separate attacks but they would be caught each time. In the final , they were able to catch up to Bernal. With Roglič already beginning his post-race descent back down the climb, Kuss led the group over the line at 1' 35\" down. Martin lost four minutes on the day while Eiking crossed the line at nine minutes behind.\nIn the GC, Roglič increased his advantage to 2' 22\" over Mas and 3' 11\" over López. Jack Haig () kept his fourth place at 35 seconds behind López. Martin dropped to fifth at more than four minutes behind, with Bernal, Yates, and Kuss sitting within a minute of him. Eiking dropped out of the top ten, sitting at 11th, just under eight minutes in arrears.\nStage 18.\nThe eighteenth stage was the second of back-to-back mountain stages that were expected to be decisive in the GC battle. The first ran on a false flat uphill before the riders tackled the first-category Puertu de San Llaurienzu, a long climb with an average gradient of 8.6 percent. Following the descent, the riders gradually climbed uphill towards the intermediate sprint in Bárzana after of racing. Immediately afterwards, the riders climbed the first-category , which is long with an average gradient of 8.6 percent. A descent and a valley section was soon followed by the second-category , an long climb with an average gradient of 5.7 percent and bonus seconds on offer at the summit. The descent was immediately followed by the final special category climb of the race, the Altu d'El Gamoniteiru. The climb, which is long with an average gradient of 9.8 percent, is divided in two sections. The first section averages 10.3 percent before easing into a 3.5 percent section. The final averages 10.4 percent in gradient, with the climb's steepest section occurring in the final kilometre. The \"Cima Alberto Fernández\" was awarded to the stage winner.\nJames Piccoli () kicked off the attacks when he pulled away after just . He would be joined by 31 other riders, with the group quickly building a gap over the peloton. , the only team not represented in the break, began to pace in the peloton after the break was established. The gap increased to a maximum of five minutes before stabilizing. On the first climb, the Puertu de San Llaurienzu, Piccoli pushed on from the break but he was brought back near the top. At the top, Michael Storer () took maximum points to increase his total to 44 points in the mountains classification. On the descent, the peloton split under the pace set by but no contender was caught out, and the peloton eventually reformed. The pace caused the deficit to the break to decrease to three and a half minutes. As the break made their way to the top of Alto de la Cobertoria, Storer launched his attack. He quickly built a lead of a minute over the chasers at the top, where he took maximum points to take the lead in the mountains classification.\nOn the descent of the Cobertoria, Storer increased his lead to two minutes over the chasers and almost six minutes over the peloton. As the peloton reached the valley section, began to contribute to the chase. The pace saw Storer's lead decrease to less than three minutes just as he reached the penultimate climb, the Altu la Segá o del Cordal. The peloton caught the chase group on the climb, leaving Storer out front as the only remaining breakaway rider. Towards the top, Romain Bardet () and Mikel Bizkarra () attacked from the peloton. Bardet dropped Bizkarra on the descent as he held a deficit of around two minutes to his teammate up front. The peloton eventually caught Bardet just as they started the final climb of Altu d'El Gamoniteiru. \nOn the lower slopes of Gamoniteiru, Geoffrey Bouchard () and David de la Cruz () launched separate attacks, joining together before de la Cruz dropped Bouchard as he went off in pursuit of Storer. De la Cruz caught Storer with around to go before dropping the Australian with around left. Meanwhile, from behind, Jan Hirt () increased the pace in the main group of contenders for his teammate, Louis Meintjes. Inside the final , Egan Bernal () accelerated from the GC group, followed immediately by the pair of Primož Roglič and Sepp Kuss and the duo of Enric Mas and Miguel Ángel López. With to go, López attacked in pursuit of de la Cruz. He immediately dropped de la Cruz after catching him. From behind, Bernal put in a few more accelerations but Roglič and Mas were able to follow him each time. López would not be caught as he soloed to the stage win. Roglič dropped Bernal and Mas towards the line to finish 14 seconds down. Mas took third at 20 seconds down with Bernal a further two seconds in arrears. The group containing the duo of Jack Haig and Gino Mäder, together with de la Cruz and Meintjes, finished 58 seconds behind.\nIn the GC, Roglič increased his lead over Mas to 2' 30\", with López 23 seconds further in arrears. Haig retained fourth place, but he dropped to four and a half minutes behind while Bernal rounded out the top five at seven seconds behind Haig. Adam Yates () and Kuss retained their positions while Mäder climbed to eighth on GC. Guillaume Martin () dropped to ninth while Meintjes rounded out the top ten.\nStage 19.\nThe nineteenth stage featured a hilly stage with a flat finale. After , the riders climbed the third-category Alto da Sela d'Entorcisa, which is long with an average gradient of 3.9 percent. The climb was followed immediately by the second-category Alto da Garganta, a long climb with an average gradient of 5.6 percent. Following the descent, the riders tackled the second-category Alto de Barbeitos, which is long with an average gradient of 3.8 percent although the first are much steeper at 5.6 percent. The next featured rolling terrain. The final were mostly flat apart from an uncategorized climb with left, with the intermediate sprint situated near the top in , at from the finish.\nAt the start of the stage, a group of 24 riders broke clear from the peloton. Several riders attempted to bridge up to the break but the chasers were swept up by the peloton. As the break reached the top of the Alto da Garganta, some riders were dropped from the group, leaving 18 out in front. In the peloton, points classification leader Fabio Jakobsen () was dropped, with keeping the pace high to prevent him from coming back. The peloton allowed the break to build a two-minute advantage, with the gap stabilizing due to the efforts of and at the front of the peloton. As gradually decreased the break’s lead, Quinn Simmons () attacked from the break with left. After Simmons was brought back, Rui Oliveira () launched his own attack but he was caught by the chase group. At this point, only 11 riders were left up front.\nWith left, a crash brought down several riders in the peloton. The biggest victim was Louis Meintjes (), sitting in tenth on GC, as he was forced to abandon the race. Meanwhile, up front, as their lead hovered at less than a minute, Simmons accelerated for a second time, with Oliveira following immediately. Five more riders, Andreas Kron (), Andrea Bagioli (), Anthony Roux (), and the duo of Magnus Cort and Lawson Craddock (), slowly closed the gap to the lead duo. Despite their lead hovering at less than half a minute, the break managed to work well together to maintain their advantage to the finish. In the final sprint, Craddock led out his teammate, Cort, before Simmons began his sprint. Cort passed Simmons before holding off Oliveira to take his third stage win of the race. Alberto Dainese () led the peloton home at 18 seconds down. The only change in the top ten was David de la Cruz () climbing into tenth as a result of Meintjes' withdrawal.\nStage 20.\nThe penultimate stage, which ran along the Atlantic coast, featured the final chance for the climbers to take some time ahead of the final day time trial. The first half of the stage was characterized by rolling hills while the second half featured five categorized climbs. The first categorized climb came with left: the third-category Alto de Vilachán was long with an average gradient of 5.4 percent. The descent immediately led to the second-category Alto de Mabia, a long climb with an average gradient of 5.7 percent. Following the descent and a short flat section, the riders climbed the first-category Alto de Mougás, which is long with an average gradient of 6.4 percent. The first is the hardest part of the climb, with the maximum gradient at 15 percent. At the bottom of the descent, the riders passed through the intermediate sprint in Baiona with left. A short flat section led to the foot of the Alto de Prado, a long climb with an average gradient of 6.3 percent and bonus seconds on offer at the summit. Following the descent, which was split by a short uphill section, the riders tackled the second-category Alto Castro de Herville, which is long with an average gradient of 4.8 percent. The lower slopes of the climb feature a section which averages more than 10 percent in gradient before easing towards the top, though the gradients ramp up to around 9.5 percent just before the finish line.\nAt the start, several riders attempted to put themselves in the break, with the pace remaining high. After around , Matteo Trentin () and Stan Dewulf () managed to build a gap over the peloton. They would soon be joined by 14 more riders as took control at the front of the peloton. The break built a maximum advantage of 11 and a half minutes before began to set a fast pace on the first categorized climb. Up front, Michael Storer () took maximum points on the first two climbs to extend his lead in the mountains classification. On the descent of Alto de Mabia, Trentin accelerated from the break, with Mark Padun () going off in pursuit of him. At this point, the peloton was closing to within five and a half minutes of the break.\nOn the climb of Alto de Mougás, Padun, Romain Bardet (), Lilian Calmejane (), and Ryan Gibbons () bridged up to Trentin before Trentin was dropped further up the climb. Storer and Clément Champoussin () also made it back to the front on the climb. On the easier gradients near the top of the climb, Trentin, Jan Hirt (), Floris De Tier (), Jesús Herrada (), and Sylvain Moniquet () joined the front group. Storer took maximum points at the summit, clinching his lead in the mountains classification. On the descent, Gibbons accelerated at the front of the race. He gradually built his gap over the chasers, extending his lead to almost a minute and a half over the chase group as he started the penultimate climb, the Alto de Prado. \nMeanwhile, in the GC group, continued to lead on the climb of Alto de Mougás before Adam Yates launched his attack. The only GC rider unable to respond was Sepp Kuss (). Egan Bernal () also launched an attack towards the top and after Bernal was caught, Yates put in another dig. This time, only Primož Roglič (), Enric Mas (), and the pair of Jack Haig and Gino Mäder were able to follow him. Mäder immediately went to the front as Haig was now in position to move ahead of Miguel Ángel López () for the last step of the podium. The gap over the López group ballooned on the descent, with the red jersey group building a lead of over four minutes. Over the last two climbs, the group caught the remnants of the break, including the chase group. On the final climb, the Alto Castro de Herville, the group was within a minute of catching Gibbons when Yates attacked. Roglič and Mas immediately followed his move while Haig rode at his own pace before slowly coming back. Yates and Mas launched more attacks towards the top, catching and dropping Gibbons, but the other contenders came back each time. Inside the final , as the four riders looked at each other, Champoussin came from behind before immediately accelerating. He was not immediately chased down as he gained a lead of more than 20 seconds. Champoussin held on to win his first Grand Tour stage, only six seconds ahead of Roglič. Yates and Mas finished eight seconds behind while Haig was a further four seconds in arrears. A four-man group containing Bernal lost almost seven minutes as he surrendered the white jersey to Mäder.\nIn the GC, Roglič extended his lead to 2' 38\" over Mas while Haig moved inside the top three at 4' 48\" down. Yates jumped up to fourth, exactly a minute behind Haig while Mäder rounded out the top five at more than eight minutes down. Bernal, Kuss, Guillaume Martin (), David de la Cruz (), and Felix Großschartner () rounded out the top ten. The notable exception was López, who abandoned the race in the middle of the stage. He climbed off his bike in frustration after reportedly being told by his team to stop chasing and despite \"directeur sportif\" Patxi Vila's attempts to persuade him to ride again, López eventually left the race.\nStage 21.\nThe final stage of this year's Vuelta was a individual time trial from Padrón to Santiago de Compostela, which hosted the finish of the Vuelta for the first time since 2014. The first part of the course was gradually uphill, finishing off with a section averaging 7.5 percent in gradient up to the first intermediate time check at . Following the descent to , the road went uphill for a kilometre, averaging 6 percent in gradient, to the second intermediate time check with left. After a plateau section, the road continued gradually uphill towards the finish line.\nThe stage occurred in the late afternoon and early evening. As is customary for individual time trial stages, the riders set off in the reverse order of their GC positions. As a result, Josef Černý () was the first rider off the start ramp. Černý, the current Czech time trial champion, set the first benchmark time with a time of 45' 18\". His time was threatened by Chad Haga () but the American fell short by 27 seconds. Černý's time stood until Magnus Cort () beat his time at the two intermediate time checks before setting a time of 44' 16\", just over a minute faster than Černý. Thymen Arensman () challenged Cort's time but he ended up 38 seconds slower than Cort. Over the course of the day, Fabio Jakobsen () and Michael Storer () finished safely within the time limit (35% slower than the stage winner's time) to confirm their victories in the points and mountains classifications, respectively.\nThe focus soon shifted to the battle for the GC placings, with a few spots still to be decided. Odd Christian Eiking () was in contention for tenth place, with Felix Großschartner () leading him by only 16 seconds at the start of the day. Großschartner set a time of 45' 54\", seventh fastest for the stage and beating Eiking's time by more than two and a half minutes to retain his tenth place overall. The eighth spot was also up for grabs, with Guillaume Martin () leading ninth-placed David de la Cruz () by only eight seconds. De la Cruz finished with a time of 46' 16\", more than two minutes faster than Martin. He moved up to seventh overall by also overtaking Sepp Kuss (), who was almost three minutes slower than the Spaniard. Sixth-placed Egan Bernal () set a time of 45' 51\", the sixth fastest on the day while fifth-placed Gino Mäder () confirmed his victory in the young rider's classification, only ceding a minute and a half to Bernal. The last spot to be decided was the battle for third, as Jack Haig () led Adam Yates () by a minute at the start of the day. Yates was 31 seconds faster than Haig at one point but the Australian slowly brought the gap down. Haig eventually finished with a time of 46' 54\", 26 seconds faster than Yates, to hold on to his podium spot. The last rider off the start ramp was the race leader, Primož Roglič (). He was faster than Cort at the two time checks. Despite almost taking a wrong turn at one point, Roglič set a time of 44' 02\", beating Cort's time by 14 seconds to win his fourth stage of the race and confirm his third consecutive Vuelta win. He also overtook Enric Mas (), who had started two minutes earlier than Roglič, in the last few hundred metres before the finish line. With his win, Roglič finished the Vuelta with an advantage of more than four and a half minutes, the largest margin of victory since Alex Zülle in 1997. The traditional prize-giving commenced shortly afterwards."

National University did not have a team in the women's division.\nVenues.\nThe Rizal Memorial Coliseum in Manila was the primary venue for the men's tournament and for the Finals series of the women's and juniors' tournament. The Loyola Center inside the Ateneo campus in Quezon City was the venue for the women's and boys' tournaments. The Uno High School Gym in Manila was an alternate site for the women's games.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=Men's standings/&gt;&lt;section end=Men's standings/&gt;\nAs a result of a protest filed by Adamson against UST's sophomore forward Fedencio Oblina, the UAAP board found him to be ineligible for failing his NCEE qualifying tests, causing the reversal of four of UST's wins. The Glowing Goldies dropped to 7th place in the standings at 2–7 from their original 6–3 record. The forfeitures benefited Adamson, Ateneo and FEU. Ateneo found themselves on top of the standings with an 8–1 record. Oblina was later handed down a lifetime ban by the UAAP.\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nFinals.\nNumber 1 seed Ateneo only has to win once, while number 2 seed UE has to win twice to clinch the championship.\nElimination round games.\nThe UE Warriors were gunning for their 19th championship, while the Blue Eagles had reached the Finals for only the first time since joining the UAAP in 1978. (Ateneo held a twice-to-beat advantage over UE.)\nThe UE Warriors capitalized on the absence of Danny Francisco with a strong start. The Ateneo starting center was earlier hospitalized for a lung-related illness. The Blue Eagles' Jayvee Gayoso scored the first basket, but the Warriors sped off to a 10–2 run and ended the half with a 51–38 lead.\nDespite Jerry Codiñera's foul trouble, the Warriors were able to extend their lead to 83–63 with ten minutes remaining. Amid cheers from supporters in the stands, Ateneo erupted for a 22–2 run. Jett Nieto's three-point shot sparked the rally until the scores were tied at 85-all.\nUE coach Roehl Nadurata was ejected from the game in the last 3:03 after complaining against an offensive foul slapped on Conrado Barile. The Warriors were trailing, 86-87. UE's Modesto Hojilla was then called for an unsportsmanlike foul in the ensuing play when he cut into the path of Ateneo's Nonoy Chuatico who was driving for a basket. Chuatico split his charities, but the Blue Eagles still had ball possession as a result of the flagrant foul. A desperation foul by Codiñera with three seconds left in the game sent Eric Reyes to the freethrow line where he also made one out of two shots for the final count of 94-92.\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles have won their first UAAP men's championship. In contrast, the UE Warriors have lost in a Finals series after having a wide lead over their opponents for the second straight year. They were defeated by the UP Fighting Maroons in 1986.\nAwards.\n&lt;section begin=Men's awards/&gt;\nBroadcast notes.\nPTV 4 was the official broadcaster of the UAAP Season 50 Men's basketball games.\nWomen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=Women's standings/&gt;&lt;section end=Women's standings/&gt;\nAdamson's wins in the first round were reversed into losses after the board found Irmina de Guzman ineligible for skipping the one-year residency rule.

The Lady Goldies struggled early in the game, yielding a 27-44 halftime deficit to Adamson.\nA playoff to determine UST's Finals opponent was held between FEU and Ateneo after the Lady Eagles defeated the Lady Tamaraws in the last game of eliminations, 62-61. Both teams ended up with identical 7-5 records.\nSecond–seed playoff.\nThis is a one-game playoff. The winner advances to the Finals with a twice-to-win disadvantage; the loser is eliminated.\nElimination round games.\nAteneo won the playoff for the second Finals berth over FEU on September 27. The Lady Eagles fielded a team for the first time in the UAAP and had barely been together with three weeks to go before the start of the season. They needed to beat FEU twice in order to qualify for the Finals against season leader UST. They were behind the Lady Tamaraws in the standings with a 5-6 record heading into the last game of the elimination round.\nFinals.\nNumber 1 seed UST only has to win once, while number 2 seed Ateneo has to win twice to clinch the championship.\nElimination round games.\nThe UST Lady Goldies were gunning for their fourth championship, with the Lady Eagles vying for their first on the year that the team was formed.

        "text": "The 2021 Cazoo Grand Slam of Darts was the fifteenth staging of the Grand Slam of Darts, organised by the Professional Darts Corporation. The event returned to the Aldersley Leisure Village, Wolverhampton between 13–21 November 2021, after being held behind closed doors at the Ricoh Arena, Coventry in 2020.\nJosé de Sousa was the defending champion, after defeating James Wade 16–12 in the 2020 final, but he was eliminated in the second round, losing 10–9 to Peter Wright.\nGerwyn Price won the tournament for the third time in four years, defeating Peter Wright 16–8 in the final.\nDue to the dissolution of the British Darts Organisation in 2020, there was no BDO/WDF representation for the first time in the event's history.\nDuring her 5–0 victory over Mike De Decker in the group stage, Fallon Sherrock averaged 101.55, setting a new record for the highest televised average by a woman. She then went on to become the first woman to advance to the knockout stage, where she defeated Mensur Suljović in the second round, before losing to Peter Wright in the quarterfinals.\nMichael van Gerwen set a new Grand Slam record average of 115.19 during his 5–2 victory over Joe Cullen, surpassing the record set by Dimitri Van den Bergh the previous year.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund for the Grand Slam was the same as 2019 and 2020, with the winner receiving £125,000.\nQualifying.\nThe qualification criteria changed again for the 2021 tournament, as there were no Summer, Autumn or Winter Series events, as well as no Home Tour, and no events organized by the BDO, which dissolved in 2020. The addition of qualifiers from the PDC Challenge and Development Tours replaced BDO representation.\nOn 11 November, it was announced that Dimitri Van den Bergh had tested positive for COVID-19, ruling him out of the tournament. He was replaced by Chris Dobey, who was next on the list of qualifying criteria.\nThe qualifiers were:\nQualifying Tournaments.\nSince the list of qualifiers from the main tournaments produced fewer than the required number of 16 players, the field was to be filled from the reserve lists. The first list consisted of the winners from 2021 European Tour events, with the winners ordered based on Order of Merit position at the cut-off date. However, Gerwyn Price, who had already qualified, won both European Tour events, and thus this list produced no new competitors.\nSince there were still fewer than 16 qualifiers after European Tour champions were included, the players with the most 2021 Players Championship titles were added. Order of Merit position served as a tiebreaker.\nPDC Qualifying Event.\nA further eight places in the Grand Slam of Darts were filled by winners of a qualifying event on 5 November.\nThese are the qualifiers:\nAdditional qualifiers.\nThe winners of these tournaments and tours also qualified for the tournament, in place of BDO/WDF representation.\nDraw.\nThe draw was made on 5 November, with the players split into 4 pools based on their current world ranking.\nPools.\nOne player from each non-seeded pool was drawn into a group with a seeded player. The players are listed with their world ranking at the time of the draw.\nGroup stage.\n\"All group matches are best of nine legs\" \"After three games, the top two in each group qualify for the knock-out stage\"\nNB: P = Played; W = Won; L = Lost; LF = Legs for; LA = Legs against; = Plus/minus record, in relation to legs; Pts = Points; Status = Qualified to knockout stage\nGroup A.\n13 November\n14 November\n15 November\nGroup B.\n13 November\n14 November\n15 November\nGroup C.\n13 November\n14 November\n15 November\nGroup D.\n13 November\n14 November\n15 November\nGroup E.\n13 November\n14 November\n16 November\nGroup F.\n13 November\n14 November\n16 November\nGroup G.\n13 November\n14 November\n16 November\nGroup H.\n13 November\n14 November\n16 November"

        "text": "Robert \"Bobby\" Marshall (born April 11, 1972) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former defenseman who was an All-American for Miami.\nCareer.\nMarshall joined Miami in George Gwozdecky's second year behind the bench and arrived just in time for the then-Redskins to post their worst record, winning just 5 games in 1991. Despite the terrible year, Marshall acquitted himself well enough to get drafted by the Calgary Flames after the season.\nMiami had a dramatic turnaround the following year, posting its first winning season in over a decade and winning the first playoff round in program history. Marshall's third season saw even better results, with Miami finishing atop the CCHA, reaching the conference championship and receiving a bid to the NCAA tournament all for the first time in team history. Marshall's point production nearly doubled throughout the season and he was named an All-American while leading the team with 43 assists. Marshall was named an alternate captain for his senior season and his scoring output decreased along with the team's record. Miami still finished with a winning record but the team was stopped in the conference quarterfinals. \nAfter graduating, Marshall began his professional career in Calgary's farm system. He played with the Saint John Flames for just over a season before he was traded to Anaheim for Jarrod Skalde. He spent the better part of two seasons with the Baltimore Bandits but was not resigned by the Mighty Ducks once his rookie contract ended. Marshall played the majority of the 1998 season in the CHL and then headed to Europe. At the end of the '99 season he returned to North America and helped the San Angelo Outlaws reach the President's Cup Final but was back in the DEL the following year. Marshall's playing career ended in 2002 after parts of two more seasons in lower-minor hockey and he transitioned into coaching. In 2003, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletics Hall of Fame.\nMarshall first job was as an assistant for the Brampton Battalion though it only lasted for one season. He continued to coach at the junior level for several years, including a stint as the head coach for the Don Mills Flyers, but was forced to halt his career after suffering a stroke in January 2020."

        "text": "Luis Eduardo Matos (born January 28, 2002) is a Venezuelan professional baseball center fielder for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). He signed with the Giants as an international free agent in 2018, and made his MLB debut in 2023.\nEarly life.\nMatos was born in Valera, Venezuela, and was raised in the small town of Bobures, alongside Lake Maracaibo in Zulia State, Venezuela. His father (Jose), uncle (Malvin), and a number of his cousins (including former Giants outfielder Luis Alexander Basabe, Tampa Bay Rays infielder Osleivis Basabe, and former Chicago White Sox prospect Luis Alejandro Basabe) have played baseball professionally.\nCareer.\nMatos signed with the San Francisco Giants as an international free agent in July 2018 for a signing bonus of $725,000. He spent his first professional season in 2019 at 17 years of age with the Dominican Summer League Giants and Rookie-level Arizona League Giants, batting a combined .367/.438/.566 with 65 runs, seven home runs, 48 RBIs, and 21 stolen bases in 24 attempts in 251 at bats over 60 games. In the Dominican Summer League (DSL) he led the league with 24 doubles and batted .362(8th in the league)/.430/.570(9th) in 234 at bats with 60 runs (3rd), seven home runs (7th), 47 RBIs (3rd), and 12 hit by pitch (3rd). He was a DSL mid-season All Star, a DSL post-season All Star, and a \"Baseball America\" DSL All Star.\nMatos did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He played the 2021 season with the Low-A San Jose Giants, as one of the youngest players in the league. Over 109 games, he led the California League with 84 runs, 86 RBIs, 35 doubles, 21 stolen bases, and five sacrifice flies and slashed .313(7th in the league)/.359/.495(9th) in 451 at bats with 15 home runs (2nd), 28 walks (5th), and seven hit by pitch (3rd). He was the California League Most Valuable Player, a California League post-season All Star, and an MiLB Organization All Star.\nIn 2022, playing for the Rookie-level Arizona League Giants (for only seven at bats) and High–A Eugene Emeralds in the minor leagues, Matos batted an aggregate .215/.280/.356 in 376 at bats with 58 runs, 12 home runs, and 47 RBIs, while dealing with an injured quadriceps. With the Emeralds, he had the lowest strikeout rate among qualified hitters in the league. He then played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League, batted .233/.280/.361 in 86 at bats, and was named Arizona Fall League Defensive Player of the Year. He was ranked # 2 in the Giants 2022 MLB Prospect Rankings. On November 15, 2022, the Giants added Matos to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nMatos began the 2023 season with the Double–A Richmond Flying Squirrels, and batted .304/.399/.444 in 115 at bats. He was then promoted to the Triple–A Sacramento River Cats, where he was 5.7 years younger than his fellow Pacific Coast League ballplayers, and batted .398(leading the league)/.435/.685(4th) in 108 at bats with six steals in seven attempts, before he was called up on June 14, 2023, for his major league debut. At 21 years of age, he was the youngest player in Triple–A.\nHe was promoted after left fielder Mitch Haniger suffered fractured forearm in the previous night's game, and Matos was slotted in the lineup as the starting center fielder against the St. Louis Cardinals. On June 14, 2023, Matos batted second and went 1-for-3 with a run scored in his MLB debut. At 21 years of age, he became the second-youngest position player in MLB; only Cardinals outfielder Jordan Walker was younger. In 76 games during his rookie campaign, he batted .250/.319/.342 with two home runs and 14 RBI.\nMatos was optioned to Triple–A Sacramento to begin the 2024 season."

        "text": "Harvey Shapiro is an American college baseball coach, and former manager of the Netherlands national baseball team and the Bourne Braves. He was most recently head coach of the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League in 2022.\nBiography.\nA native of New Britain, Connecticut, Shapiro played college baseball at the University of Connecticut under coach Larry Panciera. He graduated from UConn in 1970 with a degree in accounting, and received a master's degree in physical education from Springfield College in 1975.\nShapiro was an assistant baseball coach at Springfield under coach Archie Allen in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also served as the school's head women's basketball coach in 1976–1977 and again from 1980 to 1983, compiling a 65–27 record over four seasons on the Springfield hardwood. He became head baseball coach at Bowdoin College in 1984 and remained at that post for 15 seasons through 1998, simultaneously leading Bowdoin's women's basketball program as head coach for the same period. While at Bowdoin, Shapiro also served as manager of the Netherlands national baseball team from 1984 to 1986, leading the club to multiple appearances in the Baseball World Cup. He became head baseball coach at the University of Hartford in 1999 and led the team for six seasons through 2004.\nShapiro's long association with the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) began in the late 1980s with assistant coaching jobs with the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox and Wareham Gatemen. He went on to skipper the Falmouth Commodores from 1994 to 1998, winning the league's coach of the year honors in 1996. Shapiro took the helm of the Bourne Braves in 2003, a post where he remained through 2021.

        "text": "During the Parade of Nations within the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony on February 4, athletes and officials from each participating country marched in the Beijing National Stadium preceded by their flag and placard bearer bearing the respective country's name. Each flag bearer was chosen either by the nation's National Olympic Committee or by the team of athletes themselves.\nParade order.\nAthletes entered the stadium in an order dictated by the Olympic tradition. As the originator of the Olympics, the Greek team entered first. \nCountries marched in order of the Chinese language. The collation method used was based on the names as written in Simplified Chinese characters and is similar to that used in Chinese dictionaries. The names were sorted by the number of strokes in the first character of the name, then by the stroke order of the character (in the order 橫竖撇捺折, c.f. Wubi method), then the number of strokes and stroke order of the second character, then next character and so on. For example, this placed San Marino () in 28th position, just ahead of Kyrgyzstan () because the initial character for \"San Marino\" () is written in 5 strokes, while that for \"Kyrgyzstan\" () is written in 6 strokes.\nThe country that will host the next Winter Olympics, Italy, marched before the host nation China entered, instead of entering between New Zealand and Serbia, according to the Chinese collation order.\nAs part of its doping penalty, Russia competes under the acronym \"ROC\" and the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee, and the name of the committee in full cannot be used to refer to the delegation.\nAnnouncers in the stadium read off the names of the marching nations in Mandarin Chinese (the official language of the host country), English and French (the official languages of the Olympics) with music accompanying the athletes as they marched into the stadium.\nAccording to the current version of the Olympic Charter, each nation had the option of having two flag bearers (a man and a woman) in an effort to promote gender equality.\nList.\nThe following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted by the sequence that each nation appeared in the Parade of Nations. The names are given in their official designations by the IOC, and the Chinese names follow their official designations by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games."

        "text": "The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February. A total of 2,871 athletes from 91 nations participated in 109 events in seven sports across 15 disciplines.\nOverall 29 nations received at least one medal, and 23 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from Norway won the most medals overall, with 37, and the most gold medals, with 16. The latter record was the highest gold medal tally at a single Winter Games. Host nation China won nine gold medals surpassing its gold medal tally of five during the 2010 winter edition. Athletes from that nation also won 15 medals overall, which eclipsed its record of 11 at both the 2006 and 2010 winter editions.\nBiathletes Johannes Thingnes Bø, Quentin Fillon Maillet, and Marte Olsbu Røiseland, and cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov won the most total medals at the games with five each. Bø also earned the most gold medals with four. Snowboarder Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand won the first Winter Olympic gold medal for that nation. Germany achieved a podium sweep in the men's two-man bobsleigh competition with Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis winning gold, Johannes Lochner and Florian Bauer earning silver, and Christoph Hafer and Matthias Sommer attaining bronze.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.\nTwo bronze medals were awarded to Daniela Maier and Fanny Smith for a third-place tie in the freestyle women's ski cross event following a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nOn 29 January 2024, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) disqualified Kamila Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation. On 30 January 2024, the ISU reallocated medals in the figure skating team event to upgrade the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading ROC to bronze."

The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAfter a terrible season, Cornell's chance to improve itself was delayed due to a lack of ice and the team didn't play its first practice until January 7. The late start caused the team to compress its schedule to play 5 or 6 games, but that was reduced when the first game against Buffalo was cancelled. Even though the team could practice on Beebe Lake, soft ice and rain made playing the game impossible. This was the first game that the team had to cancel since returning after World War I. The weather got so bad that the second schedule match, a week later, also had to be cancelled.\nWhile the start to their season couldn't have been worse, Cornell knew that weather wouldn't cancel their third game as they were to travel to Princeton. Predictably, the delayed start caused the team to come out flat against the Tigers and the Big Red lost their opening game 0–5. Stainton played well in net, however, stopping 36 shots and kept Cornell in the match until the 3rd period. By the time of their next scheduled game, Beebe Lake had frozen enough to be usable and the Big Red were finally able to play a home game. Coach Bawlf changed up his offense by swapping in Tilton at center with Burnett and started Kidd at left wing. The changes seemed to work as Cornell dominated a good Penn team to earn their first win in almost 2 years. The Big Red scored as many goals in the game as they had the entire previous year.\nThe veritable offensive deluge continued in the next match when Cornell throttled Renssealer 13–1. The team tied the program record for goals in a game and gave hope that, despite facing Yale, the Big Red may be able to finish the season with a winning record. To that point, Yale had gone 11–0 against fellow varsity clubs and hadn't allowed a goal over their previous four games. Despite playing at the Bulldogs's home arena, Cornell gave the Elis a tough test. Yale jumped out to a 2–0 lead after the first period but Tilton cut their advantage in half at the start of the second. From then on the team traded goals with the Big Red coming with a goal of tying the score on three separate occasions, but they could never find the equalizer and Yale escaped with a victory.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2021 Australian Swimming Trials was a sports event that was held from 12 to 17 June 2021 at the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre to determine Australia's swimming team to the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Paralympics.\nOlympic Qualification criteria.\nAustralia can select a maximum of 56 swimmers (26 of each sex, with up to 18 for relay only swimmers) for the Olympic team. To qualify, a swimmer must reach the allotted Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT) and finish in the top 2 positions in the \"A\" final. Following the end of the qualification period, FINA will assess the number of athletes having achieved the OQT, the number of relay-only swimmers, and the number of Universality places, before inviting athletes with OST to fulfil the total quota of 878. Additionally, OST places will be distributed by event according to the position of the FINA World Rankings during the qualifying deadline.\nParalympic Qualification criteria.\nQualification requirements to be included in the Paralympic team is decided upon different classifications based on the degree of impairment an athlete experiences relative to an able-bodied swimmer's speed and performance. The three impairment groups at the Paralympic Games for swimming are physical, vision and intellectual. In addition, strokes and events are classified under \"sport classes\" that have a prefix letter and number. At the 2021 trials, qualification is selected based on a points system rather than time. Swimmers earn points based on how close they are to the world record in their respective qualification. This system is called the Multi-Class Point Score.\nEvent key.\nThere are three swimming sport class prefixes for swimming strokes: \nAs well as swimming strokes, they are also divided into ten different categories:\nSchedule.\nThe event is scheduled with morning and evening sessions from 12 to 17 June 2021. Morning sessions are for heats while evening ones are for finals and coincided with qualifications for the Olympic team.\nM = Morning session, E = Evening session\nResults.\nKey:\n&lt;br&gt;\nLegend: \nRecords.\nDuring the 2021 Australian Swimming Championships the following records were set.\nOlympic and Paralympic Team.\nFor the Olympic team, up to 56 athletes will be selected and finalised on 17 June 2021. The following table includes athletes who were placed in the top 2 in the finals within the OQT, considered for relay events or selected as part of additional FINA selection. The Paralympic team is selected differently from the Olympic team and is based on a points system rather than just time.\nControversy.\nDays before the event, Madeline Groves, a dual silver medallist at the 2016 Summer Olympics withdrew from the trials as \"a lesson to all misogynistic perverts in sport\". Groves' withdrawal and comments drew considerable media attention and concerns from Swimming Australia President Kieren Perkins. On June 12 at the start of the trials, Swimming Australia announced that they were setting up an independent panel to investigate issues relating to the experiences of girls and women in the sport.\nBroadcast.\nThe trials marked the second time Amazon Prime Video broadcast the event via its streaming platform. Grant Hackett, Nicole Livingstone, Annabelle Williams and Giaan Rooney alongside Matt White and Jon Harker were announced as the commentators for Amazon Prime Video on 18 May 2021. The commentary team was also joined by former Olympic medallists James Magnussen and Jodie Henry as poolside interviewers."

Cooper is a Canadian retired ice hockey goaltender who was an All-American for Colgate.\nCareer.\nCooper arrived at Colgate University and joined the ice hockey team a year after making its first ever NCAA Tournament appearance. He played as a backup in his freshman season and transitioned into the starting role as a sophomore. Cooper was so vital for the defense that he was named as the team's best defensive player for three consecutive years. Unfortunately, Colgate's offense didn't keep pace with the defense and the team finished 10th in ECAC Hockey, missing the postseason entirely in Cooper's first year as a starter.\nIn Cooper's junior season, the offense was still rather paltry but he and the defense played well enough to give the team just the second 20-win season in program history. He set program records for wins (18), games played (32), and saves (944) and got the Red Raiders back into the playoffs, albeit for just one game. As a senior he played nearly as well, setting a program career record with his 6th shoutout and was named an All-American.\nAfter graduating, Cooper signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins and began playing in their farm system. After an unspectacular season with the Baltimore Skipjacks, Cooper had his breakout campaign with the Muskegon Lumberjacks in 1987. He tied for the league lead with a 3.30 goals against average and was named as a First Team All-Star while helping Muskegon win their conference. Unfortunately, in the postseason the team decided to use Frank Pietrangelo as the starter and Cooper played in just one playoff game as the team marched all the way to the finals. Cooper was never able to recapture the magic he had found in 1987 and played for four different minor league teams over the next three seasons, mostly as a backup. He retired after the 1990 season.\nIn 1998, Cooper was inducted into the Colgate Athletic Hall of Fame. more than a decade later he became the goaltending coach for the Vermont women's team, resigning in 2014 after the team posted its first 10+ win season."

        "title": "Roger Graham (American football)",
        "text": "Roger Alton Graham (born November 8, 1972) is a former American football running back who played one season in the National Football League (NFL) for the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was originally signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys in 1995, following a career at University of New Haven where he won the 1993 Harlon Hill Trophy.\nEarly life and college career.\nGraham was born on November 8, 1972, in Bronx, New York. He attended Spring Valley High School before playing college football at University of New Haven. He gained 389 yards his senior season of high school as a fullback, and was recruited to New Haven as a linebacker. He convinced the team to put him at tailback, and made an immediate impact when started, setting the all-time school record for single-game rushing yards, with 262 in a 30–31 loss vs. . A week later, he earned rookie of the week honors after a 251-yard performance against in a 60–64 loss. He split time as tailback in his freshman season, but still managed to rack up 942 yards, a school record at the time. He also scored eight touchdowns on 161 rushes, achieving 5.9 yards per carry.\nGraham earned an increased role in his sophomore year, and broke the single-season New Haven record for rushing yards. \"Sports Illustrated\" named him player of the week after he recorded 298 rushing yards and five touchdowns (90, 61, 46, 46, 4) on 18 carries, with an average of over 16 per carry. By September 12 he averaged over 210 yards rushing per game, leading the NCAA Division II. By just four games played in the 1992 season, Graham had over 725 rushing yards on just 77 carries, averaging 9+ yards per. He had 200 yards and two touchdowns in an 80–26 victory over on September 26. His coach, Mark Whipple, commented, \"We want to put the football in Roger's hands 20 times a game. He is a game breaker. People bounce off him and then he has the speed to outrun other players. He's a combination of speed and power.\" He also called Graham \"the most talented back I've ever been around in coaching.\" An article by \"The Journal News\" wrote, \"The thought of an improved Graham is scary. He's already New Haven's second-leading career rusher, just four games into his sophomore year.\"\nGraham would become the school's all-time leading rusher in his fifth sophomore appearance, following a 192-yard game against Central Connecticut. By his fifteenth overall appearance, Graham averaged over 120 yards rushing per game. He helped the school achieve its sixth consecutive 1992 win following a performance that included 236 yards rushing, and three touchdowns, against American International. In the game he became the first New Haven player to top 1,000 single-season yards, as well as the 20th New England player to reach 2,000+ total career yards. He was named Division II honor role after carrying 17 times for 140 yards with two touchdowns, helping New Haven win its ninth game of the year. He would finish the season with 1,717 rushing yards, helping New Haven make the playoffs and break the record previously set by him in the last year by 775. The 1,717 yards was enough to lead the entire Division II as well as give him first-team Little All-American honors. He finished third in Division II scoring with 22 touchdowns.\nIn his junior season, Graham would rack up over 1,600 yards, being rated one of the county's top running backs. In the third game of the season, against Clarion, Graham recorded 223 rushing yards on 21 carries, averaging over 10 yards per and helping New Haven rank 3rd nationally. On each of New Haven's scoring drives in the 35–23 victory, Graham made an important contribution. In the first, he made a 32–yard rush, setting up his one-yard rushing score; in the second, he scored his first career receiving touchdown, from 19 yards out, thrown by Jim Weir; over 60 of the yards gained in their third drive were gained by Graham; he ran for 52 yards in the fourth, later scoring on a one-yard rush; he also scored the touchdown in their fifth and final score, on a 2–yard rush set up by his 14–yard run. Graham finished the year with 21 consecutive 100+ yard games.\nOn ceremonies held on December 10, 1993, Graham was awarded the Harlon Hill Trophy, given to the best player in Division II, after beating out finalists Tyrone Rush and Jamie Pass. He was given the honor despite not having started a single game all season, as senior back A. J. Livingstone was given the starting role each game. His coach Mark Whipple said, \"He's (Graham) better than the other guy. It's just that the other guy is a senior ... Roger will definitely be the man next year.\" Whipple also said, \"Next year, he's going to be the man. He has a chance to break every single record.\" He became the first and only New Haven winner, following a season that included 1,687 rush yards, an average of 13.6 points scored per game, and an average of 9.2 yards per carry. In the finalist voting, Graham received 35 first-place votes, and 165 total points. At the time, the 165 points were the second-highest total in the history of the award. His school finished the season undefeated, compiling a 10–0 record before being eliminated in the playoff quarterfinals. In addition, Graham was named to the Little All-American team for the second consecutive year.\nFollowing his award-winning junior season, Connecticut governor Lowell Weicker declared February 2, 1994, \"Roger Graham Day\". His hometown of Spring Valley, New York did the same on June 1. His teammates nicknamed him \"Harlon\" after his winning of the Harlon Hill Trophy. \"The guys have nicknamed me 'Harlon.' It doesn't bother me,\" said Graham in a 1994 interview.\nHe went from averaging 15 carries per game in his previous seasons to nearly 28 per game in the 1994 season. In the first game of the season, a 38–6 victory against , Graham recorded over 200 rushing yards and three scores in the 21st consecutive New Haven regular season victory. An Indiana coach commented on Graham, \"There is the run-and-shoot and then there is the run-and-shoot with Roger Graham ... Graham is certainly outstanding.\" When the New Haven Chargers played Indiana, ranked no. 2 nationally, they won on a late field goal at the end of the fourth quarter. Graham played an important role in the game, which had the biggest attendance in school history. By October 27, Graham trailed only Walter Payton, one of his favorite players, as all-time Division II scorer. \"I had a video of Payton that I watched all the time when I came to New Haven,\" he said. \"My style is to make the initial contact, bounce off the tackle and then make something happen.\" \"That's the way Payton ran,\" coach Tony Sparano said. \"Like Payton, Roger has the speed once he gets into the secondary to run away from people.\"\nWith three games remaining in the 1994 season, Graham needed 55 points to break the all-time points record in Division II, 65 for all divisions; five touchdowns to set the Division II record, 12 all divisions; 778 yards to break all divisions record for rushing yards; and three 100-yard games to tie the all divisions record. He had rushed for 1,197 yards and 15 touchdowns by that point. Graham finished the season with 1,607 yards on 278 carries, a 5.8 average with 17 scores. He finished no. 1 in the state of Connecticut for rushes, yards, touchdowns and yards per game (160.7). He finished his career with 5,953 yards, fifth all-time in the NCAA. He was a 2000 inductee to the New Haven Chargers Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nGraham did not have an injury until his final college game, but \"the timing couldn't have been worse\", as it affected his combine statistics and made his draft projection go from round 3 to undrafted. \"Coming out of a small school, it hurts,\" he said. \"It doesn't look good to be in a small school and be in the predicament I'm in now.\" He was ranked by Mel Kiper as the 34th rated running back in the draft.\nHe would end up going unselected, being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. He recorded 15 carries for 66 yards in two preseason games before being released. In February 1996, he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. He appeared in one game with the Jaguars, becoming the fourth New Haven attendee to play professionally. It would be his only career game."

The tournament was won by Spain, who, along with Ukraine, Portugal and Belarus earned qualification to the World Cup by finishing in the top four positions; Ukraine subsequently withdrew from the World Cup before it began and were replaced by Switzerland.\nFormat.\nThe competition format was as follows:\nThe tournament started with a round-robin group stage; the lowest ranked ten teams entered at this point. Five nations, the group winners and best runners-up, advanced to the next round.\nThere was then a second round-robin group stage; the highest ranked 11 teams entered at this point. Plus the five qualifiers from the first group stage, a total of 16 teams competed during this round. The top two teams of each group (total of eight nations), advanced to the knockout stage.\nThe knockout stage began with the quarter-finals and ended with the final. The four winners of the quarter-final ties secured qualification to the World Cup; they also progressed to the semi-finals to continue to contest the tournament title.\nThe nations not advancing from the second group stage played in consolation matches to decide ninth through sixteenth place; the nations not advancing from the quarter-finals played in consolation matches to decide fifth through eighth place.\nTeams.\n21 teams entered the competition:\nNotes:\nDraw.\nThe draws for both the first and second group stages took place at 12:00 CEST on 4 June, at Beach Soccer Worldwide's headquarters in Barcelona, Spain. It's procedure was as follows:\nThe ten teams entering the first group stage were drawn into two groups of three and one group of four. Firstly, the three highest ranked teams were seeded and one each automatically assigned to the head of one of the groups. The remaining seven teams were split into two pots of three and one pot of one, with the highest ranked teams placed in Pot 1 through to the lowest ranked placed in Pot 3.\nFrom Pot 1, the first team drawn out was placed into Group A, second into B and third into C; they were allocated to position 2 in their respective groups. The teams from Pot 2 were drawn in the same manner; they were allocated to position 3 in their respective groups. The solo team in Pot 3 was drawn alongside a lot from an additional pot containing three lots marked with one of the names of the three groups, to determine which group it would be randomly placed in; it was allocated to position 4 in that group.\nThe composition of the seeds and pots is shown below:\nThe sixteen teams competing in the second group stage were drawn into four groups of four. Firstly, the four highest ranked teams of the 11 entering at this stage were seeded and one each automatically assigned to the head of one of the groups. The remaining seven teams entering at this stage plus the then unknown best qualifier from the first group stage were split into two pots of four, with the highest ranked teams placed in Pot 1 and the lowest ranked placed in Pot 2.\nFrom Pot 1, the first team drawn out was placed into Group A, second into B and so on; they were allocated to position 2 in their respective groups. The teams from Pot 2 were drawn in the same manner; they were allocated to position 3 in their respective groups.\nThe composition of the seeds and pots is shown below:\nFirst group stage.\nEach team earns three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat.\nAll times are local, WEST (UTC+1). Kickoff times shown were those scheduled; actual times may have differed slightly.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nSince Groups A and C consisted of just three teams, for the third placed team from Group B, their result against the team finishing in fourth place in their group was discounted for this ranking.\nSecond group stage.\nAs per the regulations of the second group stage draw, the statistically best qualifier from the first group stage was automatically allocated to position B3; this was Denmark.\nThe other four qualifiers (Estonia, Kazakhstan, Norway and Romania) were placed into the groups via a draw, made after the conclusion of the first group stage.

        "title": "Kentucky Horse Racing Commission",
        "text": "The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission is the state agency responsible for regulating horse racing in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The agency was established in 1906, making it the oldest state racing commission in the United States.\nAgency overview.\nThe commission consists of fifteen members appointed by the Governor of Kentucky. Three of the members, the secretaries of the Public Protection Cabinet (which oversees the commission), the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet, and the Economic Development Cabinet serve as \"ex officio\" members. Each member serves a four-year term.\nAs the agency overseeing horse racing in the state, the commission holds jurisdiction over the various aspects of the industry. These include betting at racetracks, equine medication, and ensuring the safety of jockeys. The commission's various regulations are enforced by the state's stewards.\nOversight of the Kentucky Derby.\nThough the commission regulates the entire horse racing industry in Kentucky, it is best known for its regulation of the Kentucky Derby, one of the three Triple Crown races. The agency's decisions regarding this race attract significant media coverage.\nMost notable are the two instances wherein the commission disqualified the winning horses. The first occurred in 1968 with the horse Dancer's Image. Following the conclusion of the race, the agency conducted urine samples of each horse in the race, as per protocol. The results for Dancer's Image came back positive for phenylbutazone, a pain reliever banned in Kentucky at the time. As a result, the horse was disqualified following the race, even though owner Peter D. Fuller denied any knowledge of treating the horse with the drug. He later claimed that the horse had been drugged by those displeased with Fuller's friendship with Coretta Scott King. Fuller later appealed the decision all the way to the Kentucky Court of Appeals. The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the disqualification was merited, affirming the commission's decision.\nThe second occurred in 2019 with the horse Maximum Security. Unlike in 1968, where the disqualification occurred days after the race, Maximum Security was disqualified on the day of due to an infraction committed during the race. At the conclusion of the race, the connections of the second-place finisher, Country House filed an objection alleging that Maximum Security had unfairly impeded their horse during the race. Upon reviewing the instant replay of the race for around thirty minutes, the commission's chief steward Barbara Borden and two other stewards affirmed the objection and disqualified Maximum Security. The decision provoked significant controversy, as many felt Maximum Security had outperformed the rest of the field. Critics included then-President Donald Trump, who blamed political correctness for the ruling. Gary West, Maximum Security's owner, appealed the decision in federal court, but both the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. In a 2021 interview, Borden noted that reviewing the race through instant replay was standard procedure and only took a closer look at the alleged interference following official notice of an objection. Others involved in horse racing, including trainers Todd Pletcher and Shug McGaughey, defended the stewards' decision, with McGaughey stating the interference could have been much worse."

Thornton also coached at University of Nebraska, University of Missouri, and the St. Louis Football Cardinals.\nEarly years.\nA native of Toledo, Ohio, he attended Libbey High School in Toledo, graduating in 1959. Thornton participated in football, basketball, and track at Libbey. Thornton was recruited by numerous colleges but chose Nebraska over offers from Ohio State and other Big 10 and Mid-American conference schools.\nCollege football career.\nThornton played college football as a “two-way player” as a fullback and linebacker at Nebraska from 1960 to 1962.\nThornton was selected by the Associated Press as a first-team fullback on the 1961 All-Big Eight Conference football team after his junior season. Thornton also earned Honorable Mention All-American from the Associated Press for the 1961 season.\nA pre-season separated shoulder injury shortened Thornton’s 1962 senior season at Nebraska. However, he still was a Husker co-captain, garnered Honorable Mention All-Big 8 and played in the post-season East-West Shrine All-Star game in San Francisco.\nUniversity of Nebraska honor.\nDuring his senior year at the University of Nebraska, Thornton was inducted into the prestigious Innocent’s Society, which is the University of Nebraska chancellor’s club that honors outstanding seniors for their academic and leadership abilities. Thornton was the first black inductee into the Society.\nProfessional football playing career.\nThornton was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals with the 58th pick (5th round) in the 1963 NFL Draft. He played for the Cardinals from 1963 to 1965 and in 1967, appearing in 47 NFL games.\nCollege coaching career.\nHired in 1969 as a University of Nebraska football graduate assistant by then coach Bob Devaney, Thornton was promoted in 1970 to be the first black coach in the history of the University of Nebraska football program. Thornton coached at Nebraska from 1969 until early 1972. During his three-year stint as a coach with the Huskers, Nebraska won 3 Big 8 Conference titles and two (1970 and 1971) national championships.\nIn 1978, Thornton was hired as the running backs coach for the Missouri Tigers football team under head coach Warren Powers. Thornton coached the running backs at Missouri from 1978 until 1982. During that period, Missouri advanced to four bowl games (1978 Liberty Bowl, 1979 Hall of Fame Classic, 1980 Liberty Bowl, and 1981 Tangerine Bowl). \nProfessional Coaching career.\nIn March 1972, immediately after the Cornhuskers 1971 National Championship season, Thornton left Nebraska and was hired as the running backs coach for the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals. Thornton was the first black coach ever hired by the NFL Cardinals franchise. Thornton held that role for just 5 months until resigning just before the start of the 1972 NFL season.\nLater years.\nAfter retiring from coaching, Thornton worked for 16 years for the State of Missouri. He died in 2008 in Columbia, Missouri, of complications from diabetes."

During this allocation no nation may qualify more than five male or four female competitors. If there are less than 12 nations with at least four male competitors, then the next nation with three allocated quota places will be allocated an additional quota place until there are twelve qualified teams.

A maximum of 30 athletes can be entered by a National Olympic Committee, with a maximum of 16 men or 16 women. If a NOC has qualified enough athletes to enter the mixed team event in aerials then they may extend their total to 32 athletes.\nAllocation of quotas.\nAt the end of the qualification period of 16 January 2022 quotas will be awarded using the Olympic Quota Allocation List (which includes all results of the World Cups from July 2020 and the results of the 2021 World Championship). The spots will be awarded to each country per athlete appearing on the list starting at number one per event until a maximum for each event is reached, except for the aerials events which will stop at 22 of 25. Once an NOC has reached the maximum of 4 quota spots in an event, it will no longer be counted for the allocation of quotas. If a nation goes over the total of 16 per sex or 30 (32 if entered in the mixed team aerials) total it is up to that nation to select its team to meet the rules by 18 January 2022. Any vacated spots will be then awarded in that event starting from the first athlete not to be awarded a quota. Freeski Slopestyle and Freeski Big Air are calculated as one event.\nAllocation for the mixed team aerials event.\nAny nation that has qualified at least three athletes in the aerials competitions, and at least one from each gender, may enter this event. If less than eight teams have the required number of athletes then NOCs that need either one more male or female competitor will be awarded a quota to enable participation in the team event. Once eight teams are formed, and if there is still less than 25 quotas filled in the male or female events, then the allocation process described above will continue.\nAdditional participation for already qualified athletes.\nThe halfpipe will have quota limits of 25 athletes in both male and female events. However, athletes who have qualified in slopestyle or big air, and have met the qualification standard in halfpipe, may also compete bringing the event totals up to a maximum of 30 per gender. Similarly the slopestyle and big air events may include athletes who have qualified in halfpipe as long as each event total does not exceed 30 per gender.\nHost country places.\nIf the host China has not earned at least one quota place in each event they will be entitled to one quota within the prescribed maximums, provided the athlete has met the qualification standard.\nCurrent summary.\n\"As of 21 January 2022.\"\nNext eligible NOC per event.\nA country can be eligible for more than one quota spot per event in the reallocation process. Bolded NOCs have accepted quotas while NOCs with a strike through have already passed."

        "text": "The 1929–30 Penn Quakers men's ice hockey season was the 13th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPenn revived its ice hockey program and announced the team's schedule in early December. With new coach Normand Shay, a former NHL player, in charge of the program, there was hope that the team could do well despite several years of inactivity. To entice the potential fans even more was the skill of the freshman team which was supposed to make the Quakers viable in the coming years. The sport was reinstituted on a provision basis, however, and would only survive if this season if the university's Council of Athletics agreed to continue the program.\nThe team opened its season on the 11th of December and, while their loss was unsurprising, the magnitude of the defeat was a bit hard to swallow. the team was walloped 12–0 and would need to improve quickly if they wanted to compete with their contemporaries. One of the biggest issues for the club was the lack of conditioning that saw them flag badly in the later half of each period. Unfortunately, the team had little time to get better before their next game and fell 3–19 to a very strong Princeton team. In spite of the lopsided score, Penn showed some life late by scoring their three goals in the later half of the match.\nA rematch with the Tigers awaited the team after the Christmas break and coach Shay left his starting lineup unchanged. While the Quakers lost the rematch, they nearly halved the number of goals they allowed, demonstrating significant improvement during the previous month. The team had a short turnaround before the next game and welcomed Boston College to Philadelphia for the first meeting between the two programs. While Penn lost again, the margin of their defeats continued to fall and the improved play of goaltender Goodman held their opponents to 6 goals on 33 shots.\nContinued improvement put Penn closer to their first win of the season and they were within striking distance of Brown for much of their next match. The following game came against possibly the best team in the country when Yale arrived to revive the programs' rivalry. Yale ended up winning the game in dominating fashion, though Penn was missing one of its regular defensemen in Oldham.\nNearing the halfway point of their season, the Quakers had yet to win a game. However, excluding the Yale game, the team had produced better results each game and were progressing well with the training they received from coach Shay. The final game before the team paused for semester examinations was against the Pennsylvania Athletic Club and led by former Quaker player and coach, George Orton. It would turn out to be the final game behind the bench for Shay as he was replaced by Percy Fynan. The first game under Fynan was a debacle as the team was solidly defeated 1–9 but the team was getting used to their new coach as well as a new lineup. Captain O'Reilly had been shifted to wing while new addition Jim Holland was installed at center. The Quakers weren't able to improve on their first meeting with BC, mainly due to a lack of teamwork.\nTwo more losses followed in which the Quakers couldn't manage a goal but then coach Fynan had time to teach his men a new system. When the Quakers entered the game against a mediocre MIT they knew it was probably their best chance to win all season. Penn took an early lead, but soon found themselves behind. Goodman held MIT back for the remainder of the game and allowed Penn to score twice more to earn their first victory of the year. The program had one final game to play and closed out the year with a 3–1 win over Rensselaer.\nThe success at the end of the year convinced the athletic department to bring the team back for the following year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Cycling on NBC",
        "text": "Cycling on NBC is the de facto name for broadcasts of multiple-stage bicycle races produced by NBC Sports, the sports division of the NBC television network. This includes broadcasts of the Tour de France, Vuelta a España, UCI World Tour Championships, Tour of California, USA Pro Cycling Challenge, and Liège–Bastogne–Liège.\nOverview.\nCoors Classic coverage.\nIn 1985, NBC broadcast the Coors International Bicycle Classic as part of its anthology program \"Sportsworld\". Greg Lewis anchored NBC's coverage alongside Connie Carpenter and Alexi Grewal.\nTour de Trump coverage.\nFrom 1989 to 1990, NBC broadcast the Tour de Trump, which was a North American cycling stage race initially sponsored by businessman (and later U.S. President) Donald Trump.\nFor the very first edition in 1989, Dick Enberg anchored the coverage alongside Gary Gerould and analyst Clif Halsey. Greg Lewis meanwhile, interviewed cyclists after the final stage. NBC would cover at least two weeks worth of action for two hours each on Sunday afternoons while ESPN otherwise, provided the bulk of the coverage.\nThe following year, NBC announced that it would commit to airing at least six hours worth of the Tour de Trump race. This time, John Tesh anchored NBC's coverage alongside Phil Liggett.\nIncidentally, the idea for the race was conceived by John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France for CBS and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Donald Trump offered to be the race's primary sponsor and Packer's business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name.\nTour de France coverage.\nIn 1999, NBCSN, then known as Outdoor Life Network (or OLN) acquired the U.S. broadcast rights to the Tour de France for US$3 million. Coverage of the \"Tour\" on OLN brought substantially greater viewership to the then fledgling channel, due in part to the then-growing popularity of American rider Lance Armstrong. In 2004, where Armstrong would aim for a record-breaking sixth straight Tour de France title, OLN would devote over 344 hours in July to coverage of the \"Tour\", along with documentaries and other original programming surrounding the event – which was promoted through a US$20 million advertising campaign.\nOverall, while its coverage of the Tour de France helped OLN expand its carriage to over 60 million homes, rumors surrounding Armstrong's possible retirement from racing led to concerns over OLN's emphasis on him (to the point that some critics referred to OLN as standing for \"Only Lance Network\"), with critics questioning whether the network could sustain itself without the viewership that Lance Armstrong's presence had brought to its coverage.\nCarriage of the Tour de France continued through OLN's retooling as a mainstream sports channel and rebranding as Versus. In 2011, Versus owner Comcast acquired a majority stake in NBC Universal, and merged its sports cable networks with that company's NBC Sports division. NBC Sports would continue to carry the Tour on Versus, later rebranded as the NBC Sports Network (NBCSN). The 2015 Tour de France saw its highest ratings on NBCSN since 2010, with average viewership increased to 365,000 , and stage 8 having nearly a million viewers on NBC.\nBeginning in 2016, NBC began to stream additional coverage via a subscription service, including replays, the commercial-free world feed, and other second screen content. This app expanded into the \"Cycling Pass\" service on NBC Sports Gold in 2017, which would also include coverage of the UCI Road World Championships, Colorado Classic, and Volta a Catalunya.\nAfter the discontinuation of OLN's successor NBCSN at the end of 2021, linear television coverage of the Tour de France moved to other NBCUniversal cable networks such as USA Network and CNBC. NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock would also carry all stages . On February 15, 2023, NBC Sports announced that it had renewed its media rights to broadcast the Tour de France through 2029. Beginning in 2024, cable simulcasts will be discontinued, with all stages becoming exclusive to Peacock, and occasional stages simulcast by NBC.\nCNBC's coverage.\nIn 2015, CNBC aired portions of the 2015 UCI Road Cycling World Championships.\nIn 2020, CNBC aired Stage 14 and Stage 15 of the Tour de France.\nIn 2022, CNBC aired stage 8 of the Paris–Nice.\nIn 2022, CNBC aired portions of the Women's Tour de France."

He arrived in Potsdam immediately after the Golden Knights' run to the frozen four, adding depth to the team as a freshman. Over the winter break, Mueller was also selected as a member of Team USA for the 1992 World Junior Championships. While he went scoreless in 7 games, he was part of the defensive corps that shut down opponents for 5 wins and enabled the US to win the bronze medal, just the second medal the team had earned in the 16-year history of the tournament.\nFor his sophomore season Mueller increased his point total and helped the Golden Knights win the conference tournament. unfortunately, for the second straight year, Clarkson flamed out in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament. In his first two seasons Mueller had been a stable defender for the Golden Knights but he turned into an offensive dynamo during his junior year. He finished second in the nation for scoring by defensemen and was named an All-American. Unfortunately for Mueller, Clarkson lost in the conference semifinal and ended up getting left out of the national tournament.\nMueller nearly repeated his offensive production as a senior but was able to help the team finish atop ECAC Hockey. Clarkson was again felled in the semifinal but they were able to secure a bid to the 1995 NCAA Tournament. The Golden Knights got a home game for the opening round, however, they were set against defending champion Lake Superior State. While the Lakers weren't as good as the year before, they were battle tested and the team managed to fight back against Clarkson and win a hard-fought road game 5–4.\nAfter graduating, Mueller began his professional career spending most of his first two seasons with the Springfield Falcons. He headed to Europe in 1997 and spent most of the year with HPK before returning to North America. Mueller rounded out his career with a parts of two seasons in lower-level minor leagues and retired in 2000.\nAfter his playing days were over, Mueller turned to coaching, working with junior players in Michigan Wisconsin and Illinois. He was named Vice President of Hockey operations for a program in the Chicago area and led teams to two national junior championships in 2012 and 2016. After the second title, Mueller was hired by the Pittsburgh Penguins as a head coach and executive director of the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex Hockey Academy and continues to work in that role as of 2021."

        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. The center fielder (CF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Center field is the area of the outfield directly in front of a person standing at home plate and facing beyond the pitcher's mound. The outfielders' duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Generally having the most territory to cover, the center fielder is usually the fastest of the three outfielders, although this can also depend on the relative strength of their throwing arms and the configuration of their home field, due to the deepest part of center field being the farthest point from the infield and home plate. The center fielder normally plays behind the shortstop and second baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, center fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. However, efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful; players whose totals include pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Willie Mays is all-time leader in games played as a center fielder with 2,829 games played in his career. Tris Speaker (2,691), Steve Finley (2,314), Willie Davis (2,239), Ty Cobb (2,194), Ken Griffey Jr. (2,145), and Doc Cramer (2,027) are the only other players to appear in over 2,000 games in center field in their careers."

On 15 December 2023 Black Lion won their first match in the competition, defeating Welsh hosts Scarlets.\nName.\nThe name of the franchise has several inspirations. The players of the national team are sometimes nicknamed the lions, in reference to an (unofficial) anthem of the national team, which says: \"freedom is the property of the lions\". Also this is similar to the Georgian Rugby Union's slogan, \"Freedom is a lion's destiny\". The second inspiration comes from Georgian artist Niko Pirosmani, one of whose most famous works is the painting \"Black Lion\". The club logo is a reinterpretation of the lion's face in a style reminiscent of a fusion of the Georgian letters შ (\"shini\") and ლ (\"lasi\"), the initials of the club's name, in the unique typeface of the Georgian alphabet.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Black Lions squad for 2023–24 EPCR Challenge Cup is:\nCoaches.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff for the Black Lion team:"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career games played as a right fielder leaders",
        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, before a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. The right fielder (RF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. The right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders must try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The right fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of right field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder farthest from third base, the right fielder often has to make longer throws than the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often have the strongest or most accurate throwing arm. The right fielder normally plays behind the second baseman and first baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, right fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9, the highest number.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics before 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. However, efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful; players whose totals include pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Roberto Clemente is the all-time leader in career games played as a right fielder with 2,305. Paul Waner (2,250), Harry Hooper (2,183), Hank Aaron (2,174), Mel Ott (2,161), Tony Gwynn (2,144), Dwight Evans (2,092), Nick Markakis (2,074), Al Kaline (2,031), Willie Keeler (2,019), and Sammy Sosa (2,015) are the only other players to appear in over 2,000 games in right field in their careers."

A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. The pitcher is the player who pitches the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, playing the most difficult and specialized position, and as such is regarded as being at the right end of the defensive spectrum. Pitchers play far less than players at other positions, generally appearing in only two or three games per week; only one pitcher in major league history has appeared in 100 games in a single season. There are many different types of pitchers, generally divided between starting pitchers and relief pitchers, which include the middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1.\nThe sharp rise in the importance of relief pitching after 1950, and increased specialization in later decades, has led to a great increase in the number of players with high totals in games as a pitcher. Through the 2023 season, the top 24 players in career games pitched were all relief pitchers whose careers began after 1950, only two of whom were active before 1968; the top three pitchers are all left-handed. Jesse Orosco is the all-time leader in career games played as a pitcher with 1,252. Only sixteen different players have pitched in over 1,000 games during their careers."

He received a scholarship to Boston University in 1991 and was part of the increased influx of European players into college hockey following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Linna was a top defenseman for the Terriers almost from the start, being named an All-American as a sophomore and helping BU reach the first of five consecutive Frozen Fours. While his offensive production dipped as a junior, he picked up the pace in the postseason and got the Terriers to make an appearance in the championship game. For his final season with BU, Linna's offense returned to normal and he was named to the All-American squad for a second time. He pushed the Terriers to a second consecutive Hockey East championship and then helped the team win the 1995 NCAA Championship, assisting on the game-winning goal in the final match.\nDue to a new CBA for the NHL in 1995, Linna was eligible to be drafted despite being 24 at the time. With a very successful college career on his resume, he was taken by the Ottawa Senators in the 8th round. He then began his professional career in Ottawa's farm system leading the defense in scoring. After the season he decided to return home and played for HIFK for two years. In 1998 he helped HIFK win the league championship without losing a single game in the postseason. He capped off the year by winning a silver medal with the Finnish National Team at the World Championships.\nLinna returned to North America the following year for a second attempt at reaching the NHL. He played 11 games for the Milwaukee Admirals before suffering a neck injury that ended his career."

Connolly is an American retired ice hockey defenseman who was an All-American for Boston University.\nCareer.\nConnolly arrived at Boston University as the team was going through a lull. While the team was good defensively, the Terrier's offense was pretty poor during Connolly's first two seasons and, as a result, BU missed the postseason both years. The program began to climb back to prominence in Connolly's junior year with improvements on both sides of the puck. While Connolly didn't contribute much offensively, he was able to get squad to allow fewer and fewer goals, helping them to climb up to 6th in ECAC Hockey. The team didn't last long in the postseason, but the Terriers were finally back to playing winning hockey.\nEntering his senior season, Connolly was named team captain and led the team to one of its best seasons. BU finished tied for second in the conference standings, equaling the record of hated rival Boston College. The team had one of the top defenses in the country thanks to the work of freshman Cleon Daskalakis and Connolly, both of whom were named as All-Americans. In the ECAC Tournament BU knocked out BC in the semifinal and, though they fell in the championship game, it gave them the better matchup in the team first NCAA Tournament appearance in six years. The Terriers won the opening game 6–3, only to see Bowling Green surge back with a 4–1 lead after regulation. Because the quarterfinals were two-game total-goal series, the teams needed overtime to decide the winner. Unfortunately for Connolly, the final goal came from the Falcons and his college career came to an abrupt end. \nAfter graduating, Connolly played one year in the IHL before retiring."

He doubled his career point total in one season and was named an All-American but couldn't prevent Vermont from finishing last in their division. Cross retired after the season and was replaced by Mike Gilligan. Foster was named team captain for his senior season but the results were much the same. Vermont finished near the bottom of the conference standings and Foster's scoring production declined back to where it had been in his first two seasons.\nAfter graduating, Foster played one season of professional hockey before retiring. He was inducted into the Vermont Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998."

Over 19 starts between the two teams, he went 4–6 with a 3.39 ERA and 153 strikeouts over innings.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn March 14, 2022, the Mariners traded Williamson, Justin Dunn, Jake Fraley, and a player to be named later (Connor Phillips) to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suárez. Williamson began the 2022 season with the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts before receiving a promotion to the Triple-A Louisville Bats later in the season. In 27 starts between the two, he worked to a 6–7 record and 4.11 ERA with 123 strikeouts in 122.2 innings pitched. On November 15, 2022, the Reds added Williamson to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nAfter making a push for a spot in the Reds’ rotation during spring training, Williamson was optioned to Triple-A Louisville to begin the 2023 season. In 8 starts, he struggled to a 2–4 record and 6.62 ERA with 27 strikeouts. On May 15, 2023, the Reds announced that Williamson would make his debut the next day as the starting pitcher against the Colorado Rockies."

        "title": "Jim Laird (rugby league)",
        "text": "Jim Laird was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in 4 test matches (1 v England in 1932 and 3 v Australia in 1935) in the second row and at hooker. He became the 226th player to represent New Zealand. He also played club rugby league for Ngaruawahia (1930–32), and Marist Old Boys (1932-35). He also played for Waikato representative teams (1930–32), and Auckland (1933-35).\nPlaying career.\nNgaruawahia.\nIn 1930 Jim Laird was selected to play for Ngaruawahia's senior A team against Hamilton on June 21. Ngaruawahia won 22-5 and it was said that Laird, along with Joe Menzies, and Dare were “the outstanding home forwards”. On September 27 he played for Ngaruawahi in a Draffin Cup match against Huntly. Ngaruawahia won the match 12–10. Then on October 4 he played for Ngaruawahia against the same opponents for the Draffin Cup once more. Ngaruawahia won 3–0 with Laird said to be “the most outstanding player on the field”.\nThe 1931 season saw Laird playing once again for Ngaruawahia. On May 20 he played in a match against Huntly which his side won 11–8. He was then selected for a Waikato trial side between a Probables team and a Possibles side on July 25. He was listed as a reserve for both sides. On August 15 he played in the senior final for Ngaruawahia against Taupiri. Laird scored a try after a “fine” passing movement from his side, and kicked a penalty goal from halfway. Ngaruawahia won the match and the 1931 title by 8 points to 5. Two weeks later Laird played for a Lower Waikato side against Marist Old Boys from Auckland, a side he was to join the following season. Laird was listed to play in the lock position. He had been used in several positions in the forwards including prop and the second row. Marist won the match 13–11. A week later Laird played for Ngaruawahia in a Draffin Cup match with Huntly. He played in the front row of a 14–7 defeat at the hands of Huntly. Laird's final match of the season was in a trial at Taupiri to pick the South Auckland team to play the touring Eastern Suburbs team which was touring from New South Wales. Laird played in the front row for his ‘B Team’ but was ultimately not selected to play for South Auckland.\nSouth Auckland and North Island selection.\nLaird began 1932 once again in the black jersey of Ngaruawahia. His first match was for them against Hamilton on April 30. It was played at Hinemoa Park in Hamilton and saw Ngaruawahia run out 14-0 winners. Laird along with Joe Menzies and Huia Mason were reported as being “the best of a hard-working set” of forwards. On May 28 he played for Ngaruawahia against Taupiri and scored 2 tries in a 21 to 8 win. Two weeks later on June 11 he was part of the Ngaruawahia side which defeated Hamilton by 9 points to 5 and his form was good enough to gain selection for the South Auckland side. He was selected in the front row to play along with Menzies, Stephenson, Scott, Timms, and Jackways. They played against Northland on June 18. The match was for the Northern Union Challenge Cup by 15 points to 13 at Hikurangi before a crowd of 1,000. The North Island selector Thomas McClymont was present at the match to assist with choosing the team to play against the South Island. He then played for South Auckland against an Auckland XIII on July 16. Laird played well but the South Auckland team lost 29 to 13 at Carlaw Park.\nLaird obviously impressed McClymont as he was selected for the North Island side in a forward pack which included Bob Stephenson, Lou Hutt, Charlie White, Tom Timms, and Trevor Hall. The match was played at Carlaw Park before a large crowd of 15,000 and saw the North Island side win 27 points to 18. It was commented after the game that “Laird was always in the picture” though overall the “North forwards were rather disappointing as a set…” The Waikato Times wrote that Laird had “justified” his inclusion with his performance.\nLaird missed selection for the New Zealand team to play the touring England side in the first test. He was however pulled into the training squad for the second test after New Zealand had lost the first test 24 to 9. He had also been selected to play for South Auckland against the English side on August 4. It was said in the Waikato Times that he was “a splendid type of forward who earned praise for his game at Carlaw Park last Saturday, when his play, to many, warranted even New Zealand selection”. The match was played at Taupiri and the local side was thrashed by a strong English team by 64 points to 11 before a crowd of 2,000.\nNew Zealand selection and move to Marist Old Boys (Auckland).\nFollowing Laird's appearance for South Auckland against England he moved to Auckland and joined the Marist Old Boys club who played in the Auckland Rugby League competition. He debuted for them immediately playing against Newton Rangers on August 13 at the Ellerslie Reserve. He scored their first try in a 10–6 win. Laird was then selected for the New Zealand team to play England in the third test at Carlaw Park on August 20. New Zealand had been defeated in the second test in Christchurch 25 to 14 which secured the series for them. Six changes had been made to the side for the third test. Laird was partnered in the second row with Ray Lawless, with Alan Clarke at lock. Laird had replaced Lou Hutt who had suffered a compound fracture of the thumb in a match for a New Zealand XIII against England between the second and third tests in Wellington. New Zealand pushed England hard in the third test at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 12,000 and only lost 20–18 with England scoring a late try to take the win. In the first half with the scores tied at 5-5 Laird and Lawless were involved in carrying play from deep in New Zealand's end when they were on defence up to halfway with New Zealand scoring a short time later. The Huntly Press and District Gazette made a brief comment that “the two Ngaruawahia players, Laird and Abbot were very prominent in the play”.\nFollowing the third test he played for Marist in their Roope Rooster semi-final win over Devonport United. It was said that Laird along with teammates, Flanagan and Iveson, were “always dashy in the forwards”, and that he and Iveson “were the best Marist forwards”. He then played in the final against City Rovers which Marist won 28 points to 8. A week later Laird was in action again for Marist in the Stormont Shield final against Devonport United. Marist won the match 15 points to 8. The New Zealand Herald reported that “Laird was perhaps the best of the forwards” in the match. On October 8 Laird played for Marist in a Max Jaffe Cup charity match. The trophy was supposed to be awarded to the team which came runner up in the championship but as Marist had finished tied for second with Ponsonby United it was decided to have a playoff for the trophy. Marist won 37 to 8 but Laird was hospitalised with a leg injury. He was taken to Auckland Hospital “to undergo an X-ray examination at the conclusion” of the match. It “was believed that Laird had injured a bone in one leg”.\nMarist and Auckland.\n1933 saw Laird playing for his new Marist Old Boys side from the beginning of the season. He played 20 matches in total for them and scored 3 tries. Following a round 6 match between Marist and City Rovers where he scored a try it was reported that he was the best forward on the ground. He was selected following the match for Auckland's opening representative match of the season against Taranaki. Before a crowd of 10,000 at Carlaw Park Laird scored a first half try as Auckland jumped out to a 21 to 5 lead at the break before holding off Taranaki to win 32 to 20. The Auckland Star reported that “Laird and Lawless were the outstanding forwards, and were ably supported by [Cliff] Satherley and [Bert] Leatherbarrow\".\nLaird played four more matches for Marist before being selected to play in the second row for the Auckland clash with South Auckland on July 15. The match was for the Northern Union Challenge Cup and saw South Auckland hold on to the trophy with a 14–0 win at Carlaw Park. The match was played in horrible conditions underfoot with “most of the stoppages… due to mud in the eyes of the contestants”. It was reported that “the Auckland team played rather lifelessly, the outstanding forwards being Laird and Satherley. Laird was chosen as a reserve for Auckland’s matches against North Auckland on August 12, Hawke's Bay on September 2, and South Auckland on September 9 but was not required to take the field in any of these matches.\nOn September 30 Laird played for Marist against St. George who had finished runner up in the 1933 NSWRFL competition and were touring the upper North Island. Before 13,000 spectators Marist won by 25 points to 11. The Marist forwards played well with “White, Laird and Iveson … perhaps the best…”.\nIn 1934 Laird played 16 matches for Marist and scored 3 more tries. After round 8 of the Fox Memorial championship Laird was left out of the first Auckland representative match of the season. The New Zealand Herald reported that “the omission of J. Laird, Marist, and T. Hall, Newton, is hard to understand. Laird is one of the best forwards playing the code. He is always near the ball and is equally at home on attack or defence…”. He was chosen for Auckland to play against Northland on August 11. Auckland won by 19 points to 12. Laird was instrumental in starting a passing bout among the forwards down the terrace side of the field which “enabled Hall to score from a ruck in the corner” which gave Auckland a 11–10 lead. On September 15 he played for Auckland against South Auckland and scored a try in a 35–16 win. He had initially been chosen as a reserve with Satherley and Lawless in the second row but he played in the match after the forward pack was reshuffled with Satherley moving to the reserves. Laird along with Lawless and Hall “were perhaps the best forwards”. Laird's try came after “clever play by Cooke [saw] Laird following him through to score by the posts”. He would have scored another but “Lawless lost a try for Auckland through a poor pass to Laird”.\nLaird finished the season playing in 2 matches for Marist. The first was against the touring Western Suburbs. They had recently won the 1934 NSW RFL competition. Marist lost a tightly contested match by 21 points to 19 on September 21 at Carlaw Park. Marist had fallen behind 13-3 before a converted try to Hec Brisbane narrowed the scores and then “Laird gathered a bouncing ball and, running fast for ten yards towards the corner, handed on to Smith, who materialised amid cheers”. Marist later took the lead however Western Suburbs scored and converted on the fulltime to win. Laird then played in a benefit match for Hec Brisbane who was retiring after a career involving 11 seasons with Marist which also featured 50 appearances for New Zealand, 5 for the North Island, and 15 for Auckland sides. Marist won by 30 points to 21 against Newton Rangers with Laird “prominent among the forwards.\nNew Zealand selection v Australia.\nThe 1935 season for Laird was incredibly memorable for triumphant and tragic reasons. He was to resume his New Zealand career when he played in all three test matches against the touring Australian side. However it was to be the final year of his career when a serious knee infection following the third test saw him spend months in hospital and it ended his rugby league career.\nHe played 15 times for Marist and scored 4 tries during the season. He was in good form to start the season, scoring a try in a 17-17 round 1 draw with Devonport United. The New Zealand Herald reported that “Laird, Woods and Keane played splendid games in the forwards”. He was “outstanding” in Marists 10–8 win over competition leaders Richmond Rovers in their round 5 match, and “has never played better”. The following weekend in their match with Newton Rangers Laird was forced from the field early in the second half with a bad eye injury which required several stitches to close the wound. He had been “conspicuous for all-round work up to the time of his retirement”. It was thought that he would be out for a week but he ultimately was available to play a week later. The match was against Devonport United and saw Laird play in the unusual position of ‘rover’ amongst the backs with Marist deciding to only play 5 players in the forwards packing a scrum with 2 in the front row and 3 in the second row. It was a controversial formation which provoked discussion by the Auckland Rugby League in the week following. Marist had adopted the tactic partly due to Laird's eye injury and also as an experiment as Australian sides had been using the tactic for a while. It was said that Laird “played fine football” in the position. Laird was once again named as the “outstanding forward”. He was described as being “outstanding” twice more following Marists match with Ponsonby United on June 22, and their match with City Rovers on July 6.\nUnsurprisingly Laird was chosen to play for Auckland against Taranaki on August 3. He had originally been picked in the Auckland B team to play South Auckland on the same day before being moved into the Auckland A side for the Taranaki clash. Auckland ran out easy 37 to 14 winners with it said that Laird was “prominent” for Auckland. After the match he was then selected for the North Island side to play the South Island on August 17. He was selected in the slightly unfamiliar position of hooker for the game. The North Island won an extremely tight match by 19 to 18. Laird, along with his forward teammates Lou Hutt, Cliff Satherley, and W. Large were said to have shown “honest, hard toil from bell to bell”.\nLaird played in Marist's round 1 Roope Rooster 18–15 loss to Mount Albert on August 24 and scored a rare pair of tries and was involved in another. He was then named in the Auckland team for their southern tour. Before the tour began he scored a try in a Marist semi-final loss in the Phelan Shield which ended their season.\nThere were only two matches played on the tour. The first was against Wellington on September 7. Before a crowd of 3,000 in Wellington, Auckland won 39 to 27 with Laird said to have played well. He then played in the second match which was against Canterbury on September 14 at Monica Park in Christchurch. Auckland won 26 to 13 though Laird had to leave the field injured. Laird was well enough to be selected for the Auckland team to play against the Australian side in the first game of their tour. Auckland lost 16 points to 8 at Carlaw Park in front of 15,000 spectators. Laird was said to have been “always in the fray and showed form and speed in the loose”, though he did drop the ball with the line begging at one point.\nHe was named in the New Zealand team to play Australia in the first test at prop. It was said of his selection that he had “a right to inclusion” based on his performance for the North Island and the match for Auckland against the tourists the previous week. Laird played in the second row alongside Lou Hutt, with Jim Calder locking the scrum. New Zealand played brilliantly to win the match by 22 points to 14 at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 20,000. The forwards produced a fine display. Laird was mentioned as having “never been seen to better advantage and he was one of the best forwards on the field” and he was subsequently selected for the second test. New Zealand was unable to produce their first test heroics and they were soundly beaten in the second test also at Carlaw Park which was played midweek. New Zealand lost 29 points to 8. Laird, Hutt, and Calder were said to have “worked tirelessly in both the tight and loose”. Laird also “just missed a try” early in the match with the score 0-0 after the New Zealand forwards “stormed the visitors’ goal”.\nHe was still selected to play in the third test to be played 3 days later on October 5 once more at Carlaw Park. Australia won the series with a convincing 31–8 win. Laird was involved in a try saving tackle on Viv Thicknesse a foot from the line, and was the most prominent of the forwards along with Harold Tetley and Jim Calder. Following the match Laird was selected for the Auckland XIII team to play against Australia in the final match of their tour however he had suffered a leg injury which ended up becoming much worse than first thought.\nInjury and retirement.\nLaird was hospitalised with 'water on the knee' and spent several months in Auckland Hospital. At the start of the 1936 season Marist arranged for a benefit day to be held to raise money for him. The third test had been played on October 5 and he was still in hospital at the end of February. Mr. Joe Sayegh who was the Marist chairman spoke at their annual meeting of “Laird’s fine services to the game and delegates assured the board of assistance in any action taken”. On April 13 the Auckland Star reported that the injury “last season may compel his retirement”. The benefit day was held on April 18 and was a series of 4 senior matches at Carlaw Park with the proceeds from the day being spread between the 8 clubs and Laird. Marist won their match by 15 points to 5 over Newton. On May 13 Laird attended the Auckland Rugby League control board meeting to thank the board for the benefit day and also “thanked the ladies’ committee of the league for its kindness to him while in hospital”. The ARL chairman, Mr. G Grey Campbell said that “Laird would be the subject of a little function in the Marist dressing room before the team filed out to play on Saturday”. A week later the Marist club wrote to the league thanking them for their “support and assistance” through the benefit match and that “the amount raised was very creditable to the game”.\nIn 1937 Laird was elected to be the Marist club captain."

        "title": "Norm Campbell (rugby league)",
        "text": "Norm Campbell was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in one test match against England in 1932 at fullback. In the process he became the 224th player to represent New Zealand. He also played rugby league for Auckland, Marist Old Boys, Otahuhu Rovers, and Papakura as well as the Otahuhu RFC Rugby Football Club.\nEarly life.\nNorm Campbell was born Angus Norman Campbell on March 30, 1908. His mother was Agnes Maud Campbell but there was no father's name recorded on his birth registration. In 1909 Agnes married William Getty Campbell and they had a daughter named Emily Rose Campbell on 5 October 1909. William had applied for a separation order from Agnes in March of the same year on the grounds of desertion whilst living in Mount Roskill. In 1918 a divorce was granted after she claimed he had physically abused her in February 1909, and she left him and hadn't seen him since.\nNorman appears to have spent his teenage years in Ōtāhuhu as in January 1927 he was mentioned as having won the 75 yard swim race at the Otahuhu Football Club's annual aquatic carnival. Later in the same year he was listed as playing for the Otahuhu club's third grade team.\nPlaying career.\nRugby for Otahuhu RFC.\nIn 1926 and 1927 Campbell was playing in the Otahuhu junior grades but he was first listed at fullback in their senior side for a July 2 match against Marist. He played about 5 matches for them over the remainder of the 1927 season.\nRugby league switch to Otahuhu Rovers in 1928.\nHe began the 1928 season having switched to rugby league and was named to play fullback for the Otahuhu senior side in the Auckland Rugby League B division (Norton Cup). After their round 2 match against Point Chevalier it was said “Campbell, full-back for Otahuhu, gave a sterling display and he stood out as the best back on the ground. His fielding was certain and his kicking powerful and well directed. It was a treat to see the Otahuhu custodian open up the play for his three-quarters”. Following a game against Grafton Athletic on June 23 at the Auckland Domain it was reported that he “made few mistakes at full-back, and he made some good saves earlier in the game”. He was then also mentioned as a possible representative player to come out of the Senior B competition. He finished the season having played in 13 matches but it is not known if he scored any points as the individual point scoring was rarely reported in the B Division (Norton Cup).\nMove to Marist Old Boys.\nAt the start of the 1929 season Campbell moved to the Marist Old Boys who were in the first grade (Monteith Shield). He debuted in a preseason game against City Rovers and kicked a conversion in a 5–0 win. He was said to have given “a sound display”. His transfer from Otahuhu Rovers was approved of by the Auckland Rugby League on May 1. Following a match against City Rovers on July 20 the New Zealand Herald reported that “Campbell, at fullback, gave a brilliant display. He fielded surely and placed his kicks with good judgment…[his] display equalled the best seen at headquarters [Carlaw Park] this season”. He had obviously impressed the Auckland selectors (Edwin V. Fox, Ernie Asher, and Bert Avery) as he was named 2 weeks later in the Auckland training squad to play Canterbury. He was then listed as an emergency back but was not required to play. On September 21 he played in Marist's Roope Rooster final win against Ponsonby United. Then a week later he scored a try in their Stormont Shield victory over the same opponent before a crowd of 9,000 at Carlaw Park. And he then finished the season playing for Marist in two matches against the touring South Sydney side. Marist won the first match 10-9 before losing the season 21–5. He ultimately played 21 matches for Marist over the course of his first season with them, scoring 2 tries and kicking 9 goals.\nDebut for Auckland.\nThe 1930 season saw Campbell only play 9 games after he was injured in a July 5 match against Kingsland Athletic. It was thought that he would miss “several weeks” and he ultimately didn't return until their final match of the season which was a benefit match between Marist and Otahuhu for W. McManus. Earlier in the season he had been in good form and he was chosen to play for Auckland against Northland. There were 8,000 spectators on hand to see Auckland win 21–16 with Campbell converting Maurice Wetherill's first half try. He was reported to have “made good in the full-back position, and, in addition to usually kicking with judgment, showed enterprise in racing his backs into position”. He would have likely played for Auckland in their match with South Auckland (Waikato) but was unavailable. On June 4 he played for a Possibles side against Probables which was a trial to help select the New Zealand team to tour Australia. It was a curtain-raiser to the annual North Island v South Island match. His Possibles side was beaten soundly by 38 points to 3.\nNorth Island selection.\n1931 saw Campbell play 17 games for Marist, scoring 3 tries. He was part of their side which sealed the first grade title in the last round when they beat Devonport United who they had been tied with going into the match. Marist won 12–5. Following the match Campbell was selected by Thomas McClymont to play in the North Island side against the South Island. Notably there were a remarkable seven other Marist players named in the North Island side. The Auckland Star suggested that he along with other “newcomers” had “justified their inclusion by their consistency throughout the season”. And that he “has earned his place as North full-back. He kicks strongly and with judgment, when necessary, runs his backs into position, and is strong defensively. The New Zealand Herald gave a more confusing comment saying that as “custodian [he] is perhaps the best fullback seen out this season, his displays being more consistent than those of Simons and Watene, who are more impressive when in form. Campbell has scarcely shown form worthy of representative standards and a choice from other backs for the position would not have surprised”. The match was played on Carlaw Park on August 15 with North Island winning easily 52 to 23.\nOn September 26 Campbell was part of the Auckland side which drew with Northland 19-19. On October 3 Marist lost to Devonport 25–6 with Campbell at fullback and then 2 weeks later he was part of a combined Marist-Devonport side which played the touring Eastern Suburbs side. The combined team won the match 14–13 at Carlaw Park before a huge crowd of 15,000. Campbell “did fairly well at full-back, but has shown to better advantage”.\nNew Zealand selection v England.\nCampbell played nine times for Marist to start the 1932 season before being selected for an Auckland XIII to play South Auckland XIII. He had been injured in a game against Richmond Rovers on June 11 when he received a kick to the hip and was forced from the field. It was reported that he hadn't been well heading into the match. He did not miss any matches however and played in Auckland's 29–13 win over South Auckland on July 16. It was said that Campbell “played a good game at fullback…, but he has been passed over for Laing” for selection in the North Island side. He was however selected to play in the Probables side to play in the curtain-raiser though he must have pulled out as he was not included in the final playing side. Campbell was then chosen in the Auckland training squad to prepare for their match with the touring England side. He was then picked in the side to take on England with the Auckland Star reporting that “the Marist full-back, Campbell, who played such sterling football against South Auckland, may be relied upon as the last-liner for Saturday. It is not generally known that like Cooke, he started as a centre. His ability to defend, as well as link up in the chain, should be tested”. Campbell played at fullback for Auckland against England on August 6 at Carlaw Park before 15,000 spectators. Auckland pushed the tourists but lost 19–14 with Campbell kicking a drop goal.\nA week later he turned out for Marist in a match against Newton Rangers and then was picked for New Zealand for the third test against England. The New Zealand selectors had played Albert Laing at fullback in the first test which New Zealand lost 24-9 before trying Steve Watene there in the second which New Zealand again lost 25–14. Watene was being moved onto the wing and Ben Davidson being omitted which opened up the full back position.\nNew Zealand pushed England hard but ultimately lost 20–18. In the Auckland Star's match report they said that early in the match “List, Brimble and N. Campbell … featured in some great tackling”. With the score 8–5 in favour of New Zealand Barney Hudson was put in the clear before passing to Artie Atkinson but “Campbell stopped him and temporarily left the field. The ball rolled forward, but play was allowed to proceed, with the result that [Alec] Fildes was on the scene to dribble over and score a doubtful try”. The Herald described it as a “splendid tackle” and that Campbell was forced to retire after the “collision” with Watene moving to fullback however Campbell was able to take his place back at fullback at the start of the second half.\nCampbell finished the season playing in the Marist side in a Roope Rooster semi-final win over Devonport United, before they then defeated City Rovers in the final 28–8. He scored a try in the semi-final win, and a try and a conversion in the final. They then played Devonport in the Stormont Shield final on September 17 and round the season off with another trophy, winning 15–8.\nMarist and Auckland.\nCampbell took on more of the goal kicking responsibilities for Marist after round 5 of the Fox Memorial in 1933 and kicked 17 conversions and 4 penalties to go with 2 tries in 15 appearances for them. He was selected for the Auckland side to play Northland on August 12 and kicked 5 conversions in a 28–13 win. Two weeks later he was part of the Auckland side which beat West Coast 28-22 where he again converted 5 tries. The following weekend he kicked 4 conversions in a 47-17 Auckland win over Hawke's Bay. His final appearance for Auckland that season was against South Auckland (Waikato) and saw Auckland win against their neighbours by 17 points to 5 with Campbell converting a try by Roy Bright.\nFollowing the representative season Campbell played 4 more matches for Marist. One of these was against the touring St. George side. Marist won the match convincingly by 25 points to 11 with Campbell kicking 3 conversions and 2 penalties. The match was played on September 30 at Carlaw Park before a crowd on 13,000. he then played in a Max Jaffe Cup match against Richmond Rovers. As both teams had beaten St. George the match was to decide the ‘best club team in Auckland’ and saw Richmond run out easy 31-8 winners with Campbell kicking 1 conversion. They then played the same opponent on October 21 in a match to raise money for the unemployed. Marist won 16 to 5 with Campbell scoring 2 relatively rare tries.\nThe 1934 season saw Campbell playing 17 games for Marist, converting 17 tries along with kicking 9 penalties. Marist had a disappointing season finishing last in the Fox Memorial competition. They did make the final of the Roope Rooster knockout competition but lost to Richmond 20–13. Campbell kicked 2 conversions in the loss. Marist's final match of the season was against the Western Suburbs side who had won the New South Wales RFL championship on September 22 and Marist went down narrowly 21–19 with Campbell converting 2 tries.\nCampbell's only two representative appearances of the season were for Auckland against Taranaki on June 30 and South Auckland on September 15. Auckland beat Taranaki 35–8 with Campbell converting just 1 try as he was sharing goal kicking duty with Cliff Satherley. Auckland also defeated South Auckland by 35 to 16 with Campbell kicking 4 conversions.\nThe 1935 season saw Campbell start the year off in good goal kicking form with 10 goals kicked through the first 4 games of the Fox Memorial for Marist. Though he then missed 5 matches due to a “dental overhaul” which involved a lengthy recovery. It was reported on June 26 that “N. Campbell, the well-known Marist full-back, has been greatly missed by his team. Followers of the code will be pleased to hear that he is fast regaining his health”. After returning to play on July 6 against City Rovers he was said to have played very well in a 20–7 win which saw him kick 3 conversions and a penalty. He played 3 more Fox Memorial matches before he was selected for Auckland to play Taranaki on August 3. He kicked 2 conversions in a 37–14 win at Carlaw Park. Campbell was selected to play for Auckland against Australia on September 21 but was unavailable to play and his place at fullback was taken by Bert Cooke.\nRetirement and joining Papakura.\nIt was reported at the start of the 1936 season that Campbell was going to play once more. He turned out for them on May 2 against City Rovers but did not play the following week and made no further appearances for Marist. In 1937 Campbell did not play at all but then came out of retirement in 1938 to join the Papakura club. In their round 2 match the newly promoted side lost to City Rovers 23-18 but Campbell was said to have “played well at fullback and his fielding and excellent kicking often saved Papakura. On April 13 it was reported that his transfer from Marist to Papakura had gone through and that he was a “player coach”. He played in 3 more matches for the Papakura side but there was no further mention of him for the remainder of the season in any capacity.\nReturn to Otahuhu rugby.\nThere was no record of Campbell playing in 1939 but then early in the 1940 season it was reported that he had rejoined the rugby code and his old Otahuhu side. In late May the Auckland Star reported that the “New Zealand Rugby Union notified the reinstatement of A. N. Campbell”. He played in a match against Grammar on June 15. The Auckland Star said “N. Campbell, who has not played for a few seasons since his break with Marist league team, gave a very impressive display at full-back until he received an injury and had to retire at half-time”. There was no record of him playing for them over the rest of the season. He did however play in a charity match for them in June, 1941 to raise money for the All Otahuhu Patriotic Fund. He was chosen in the Past club players squad which would be playing the Present players. Then in August he was picked in the back reserves for an ex-player rugby league match between the All Golds and South Auckland."

        "text": "The New South Wales cricket team toured New Zealand from January to February 1894 and played seven first-class matches and one minor match. The tour is notable for the fact that the game against New Zealand was New Zealand's first first-class match. The tour was New South Wales' second of New Zealand after a tour in 1890. Like the previous tour it was privately organised by Coleman Davis and not officially sanctioned by the New South Wales Cricket Association. Despite this, given the touring party consisted of leading players from Sydney clubs the team is considered to have been a representative quality side and the matches played on tour to have been official New South Wales first-class games.\nTeam.\nThe following players were selected for the tour:\n&lt;gallery perrow=\"5\" caption=\"New South Wales XI in New Zealand 1893/94\"&gt;\nFile:DavidMiller.png|D.

        "text": "Jack Duffy (born September 25, 1970) is an American ice hockey coach and former defenseman who was an All-American for Yale.\nCareer.\nDuffy began attending Yale University in the fall of 1989, joining a program that had slowly improving over the course of the 1980s. Duffy was not a big scorer for the Bulldogs, but he was instrumental in getting Yale's defense to allow fewer goals in each of his four seasons. He was able to help Yale to a winning record as a junior while producing at a point per game pace. he was named team captain for his senior season and, while the results were still positive, the team stalled a bit and wasn't able to build on their modest success. Duffy was named an All-American and began his professional career the following year.\nDuffy split time between leagues in 1994 but was impressive enough to find himself in the IHL for the entirety of 1994–95. He played one more year at that level before deciding to retire as a player. He immediately turned to coaching, returning to Connecticut to work with the Greenwich Skating Club, but took several years off after starting a family. When his daughter Hayley began playing hockey, he returned to coaching. Duffy was the assistant coach of the boys hockey team at Greenwich High School for two seasons. In July 2020, head coach Chris Rurak died suddenly at the age of 47. A few months later, Duffy agreed to take over as head coach."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career games played as a left fielder leaders",
        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. The left fielder (LF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Left field is the area of the outfield to the left of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders' duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The left fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of left field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder closest to third base, the left fielder generally does not have to throw as far as the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often do not have the strongest throwing arm, but their throws need to be accurate. The left fielder normally plays behind the third baseman and shortstop, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, left fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the left fielder is assigned the number 7.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. However, efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful; players whose totals include pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Barry Bonds is the all-time leader in career games played as a left fielder with 2,715. Rickey Henderson (2,421), Luis Gonzalez (2,418), Zack Wheat (2,328), Fred Clarke (2,186), and Lou Brock (2,161) are the only other players to appear in over 2,000 games in left field in their careers."

England also played three One Day International (ODI) matches against the Netherlands in Amstelveen between the second and third Tests.\nIn November 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that Yorkshire County Cricket Club had been suspended from hosting international matches, following the racism experienced by Azeem Rafiq. Headingley was originally named as the venue for the third Test. In January 2022, the ECB set Yorkshire the deadline of spring 2022 to meet certain conditions to regain their international status for the match, with the suspension being lifted the following month.\nIn April 2022, following England's tour of the West Indies, Joe Root resigned as England's Test captain. Later the same month, the ECB named Ben Stokes as Root's successor. New Zealand named an extended squad of twenty players for the tour, with it being reduced to 15 for the opening Test match.\nEngland won the first Test match by five wickets, with Joe Root scoring his 26th century and his 10,000th Test run in the process. It was England's first win in a Test after winning just one match in their previous 17 matches. In the second Test, New Zealand made 553 runs batting first, their highest innings score in England, with England making 539 in their first innings. England were set a target of 299 runs to win the match, with Jonny Bairstow hitting a 77-ball century, helping England to a five-wicket victory. England won the third Test match by seven wickets, chasing down their target of 113 runs in just 15.2 overs on the fifth and final day, to win the series 3–0. With the victory in the third match, England became the first team to chase a target of more than 250 runs to win in three successive Test matches.\nSquads.\nOn 30 May 2022, New Zealand named their squad for the first Test, with Jacob Duffy, Rachin Ravindra, Hamish Rutherford and Blair Tickner all being released from their initial squad of twenty players. Colin de Grandhomme suffered a foot injury during the first Test match, and was later ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the rest of the series. Ahead of the second Test, Kane Williamson was ruled out of the match after testing positive for COVID-19. As a result, Tom Latham was named New Zealand's captain for the match, with Hamish Rutherford being added to their squad. Kyle Jamieson suffered a back injury during the second Test, which ruled him out of New Zealand's squad for the third and final Test match. Blair Tickner was named as Jamieson's replacement. Cam Fletcher was also ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the third Test, due to a hamstring injury, with Dane Cleaver named as his replacement.\nAhead of the third Test, England added Jamie Overton to their squad. Prior to the start of the fourth day of the third Test, Sam Billings was added to England's squad as a COVID-19 substitute, after Ben Foakes returned a positive COVID-19 test the previous evening. Billings took the field at the start of day four, keeping wicket."

        "text": "The 1937–38 Columbia men's ice hockey season was the 23rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter resuscitating the squad in the mid-30's as a club team, Columbia's ice hockey program received approval from the administration for the first time in 14 years. The team was led by senior captain Chris MacFadden who had been a driving force behind the team's return. The Lions were hoping to get an early start on the year and begin practicing before Thanksgiving, however, ruptured pipes at the Brooklyn Ice Palace forced the team to wait until the beginning of December. Even without the issues, Columbia would have been hard pressed to defeat their first opponent of the season. Dartmouth was one of the top programs in the country and were full of players used to facing difficult opposition. The predictions bore out in Columbia's 0–7 loss while goaltender Alex Green was credited with holding the Indians scoreless in the first period.\nColumbia's schedule didn't get any easier as their next game was against defending east intercollegiate champion Harvard just after Christmas. The match was eventually cancelled, however, and put the team on the shelf for a week. upon their return to campus, the Lions took on the Long Island Saltons, a local amateur club, and played a hard defensive game. The team earned a tie and were hoping that the result was a sign of improvement for the Blues. Jack Mitchell's scored Columbia's first goal of the season. Two days later the Lions suffered another lopsided loss, but their opponent, the St. Nicholas Hockey Club, had performed a similar feat on three other top collegiate teams so the loss didn't sting quite so much.\nIn Columbia's next game, the team was able to demonstrate that their defense was worthy of praise by holding the New York Athletic Club to just a single goal. Unfortunately, the Lions weren't able to score themselves, and lost their third game of the season. The next recorded match came against Army after the semester break and, despite playing most of the game tied, the Cadets pulled ahead in the third and won 3–1 (Army records do not include this game so its likely that the Lions played the JV squad). The following weekend, the team lost another game to an amateur team, doing so without the services of their captain. When the team played their second game of the week the offense finally made an appearance. The Lions netted 6 goals but it was one too few and Columbia lost their rematch with the New York Athletic Club.\nColumbia ended a hectic week with back-to-back meeting on Friday and Saturday night. The first game saw the Lions earn their first win of the season, downing the Long Island Falcons on the strength of a Bill Shanahan goal. Their jubilation was curtailed the following evening when they were blanked by Princeton. To make matters worse, they weren't even facing the primary Tigers' team and had lost to the junior-varsity squad.\nThe team's second win on the year came in the first round of the New York Amateur Hockey Association tournament, where they once again downed the Falcons. Columbia's final game of the season came against Brown and the team put up a valiant effort but were unable to come out on top.\nThe following season, Columbia attempted to put a team together, but without the McFadden and McMahon nothing came to fruition. Any games that the program scheduled were eventually cancelled and Columbia has yet to play another varsity game (as of 2021).\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Sapporo bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics is a proposed bid to bring the 2030 Winter Olympics to the city of Sapporo, Japan. After the 1940 Winter Olympics were abandoned due to war, Sapporo previously hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first time that the Winter Olympics were held in Asia. They also hosted the 1986 Asian Winter Games, 1990 Asian Winter Games, 2017 Asian Winter Games and most recently the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007 and 2015 World Women's Curling Championship.\nDetails.\nSapporo 2030 was the first official bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics.\nSapporo was initially considered to bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics, but was withdrawn on 17 September 2018.\nDue to the cost overrun from the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics and facing a very likely situation of withdrawing the bid, a revised budget that was released which would lower the cost of the games to between 280 billion and 300 billion yen.\nA recent report which was released before the start of the Beijing games showed that, due to climate change, by the end of the century, Sapporo might be the only city among the 21 cities to have hosted the Winter Olympics to be able to provide fair and safe conditions to host the Winter Olympics.\nIn March 2022, Sapporo's government released a draft plan for the games.\nIn December 2022, Sapporo officials said that that organizers would \"discontinue for some time\" while investigating the scandal relating to Tokyo 2020, but the bid would not be canceled.\nOn 10 April 2023 Japanese Olympic Committee President Yasuhiro Yamashita has revealed that talks are set to get underway over possibly delaying Sapporo's bid from 2030 to 2034.\nImpact of Tokyo 2020 Bribery scandal.\nA number of bribery and corruption allegations tied to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games have surfaced since mid-2022, which have been viewed as a potential setback for Japan in its bid to host the 2030 Games. Seiko Hashimoto, an Olympic bronze medalist, politician and former head of the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, said in December 2022 that the scandal seemed \"very severe,\" adding that it was important to sort the issues out so that Sapporo can proceed with its 2030 Olympic bid efforts. Later that month, Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki admitted that it was \"difficult to keep fostering momentum\" for the 2030 Olympic bid due to the corruption allegations. Sapporo mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto announced on 20 December 2022 that his city would halt the aggressive promotion of its 2030 Olympic bid in order to \"dispel the public's unease\" about the scandals and reconsider their promotion tactics."

The race usually takes place after the MXGP season, however because the 2021 GP schedule runs from April through November, the MXoN will take place in the middle of the MXGP series.\nEntry list.\nStart numbers will be allocated based on the team finishes from the 2019 competition. This will allocate number plates 1, 2 &amp; 3 to the Netherlands (1st), 4, 5 &amp; 6 to Belgium (2nd) and 7, 8 &amp; 9 to the United Kingdom (3rd). The remainder of the top ten finishers were as follows: Estonia, France, United States, Germany, Latvia, Spain and Denmark.\nThe official entry list was published on 14 September.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that ultimately led to the cancellation of the 2020 event, meant that some of the sport's most important nations were unable to send a team. United States will miss their first MXdN since 2004, whilst Australia will be absent for the first time since 2002. Other nations absent who competed in 2019 included New Zealand, Japan, Puerto Rico, Cyprus and Luxembourg.\nIn addition to this, many of the sports top riders have decided to opt out of racing for their country due to the event's scheduling putting it in the middle of the 2021 world championship season. Tim Gajser (Slovenia), Romain Febvre &amp; Maxime Renaux (France), Jorge Prado (Spain), Jeremy Seewer (Switzerland), Pauls Jonass (Latvia) and Jago Geerts (Belgium) all decided against competing, whilst Jeremy Van Horebeek (Belgium) withdrew from the event after initially being selected. He will be replaced by Cyril Genot.\nDespite these challenges, the entry list features only one less nation than in 2019. A number of nations will return to the event after being absent in previous additions. Venezuela and Canada return for the first time since 2018. Former podium finishers Finland, as well as Slovakia, return for the first time since 2017, whilst Morocco will return to the event for only their third appearance - their last coming in 2015. Bulgaria are scheduled to compete for the first time ever in the event, the first debutant since Kuwait in 2011.\nRussian athletes competed as a neutral competitors using the designation MFR (Motorcycle Federation of Russia), as the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a ban on Russia competing at World Championships. The ban was implemented by the World Anti-Doping Agency in response to state-sponsored doping program of Russian athletes.\nPractice.\nPractice is run on a class by class basis.\nQualifying Races.\nQualifying is run on a class by class basis.\nTop 19 countries after qualifying go directly to the main Motocross des Nations races. The remaining countries go to a smaller final.\nBest 2 scores count.\nB-Final.\nThe B-Final is for the nations who finished 20th-31st in qualifying. The top nation from the B-Final qualify for the Motocross des Nations races.\nBest 2 scores for each nation counts.\nMotocross des Nations races.\nThe main Motocross des Nations races consist of 3 races which combine two classes together in each. Lowest score wins with each nation allowed to drop their worst score after the final race."

The team was founded by students of St. John's College, but as information about this team has been mostly lost to history, it seems that the football team was not officially associated with the college (as mention of the team is not found in any of the school's official history). There was a St. John's Royalists junior football team, but no information links it to the MRFU club.\nThe St. John's Rugby Football Club was a very successful team, having won 13 MRFU championships in the 31 seasons they played.\nWhile the St. John's Rugby Football Club did merge with new \"Winnipeg Rugby Football Club\" in 1932, the team is not part of the official history or records of Winnipeg's current team: the Blue Bombers."

        "text": "The 1938 Auckland Rugby League season was its 30th. Marist Old Boys won their 3rd first grade title with their previous coming in 1924 and 1931.\nRichmond Rovers won the Roope Rooster for the 5th time when they beat City Rovers 20–8 in the final. City had not won a trophy since 1925 but had been boosted mid season by the addition of Bob Banham who the Auckland Rugby League had brought over from Australia as a player coach. Richmond also won the Stormont Shield for the 4th time when they defeated Marist Old Boys 9–8. Eastern Suburbs (NSWRL runner up) toured at the end of the season and Richmond were the only team to beat them when they won 11–9. Eastern Suburbs beat Marist (36-15), Manukau (16-7) and a South Auckland (Waikato) team (17-5).\nManukau, who were coached by former Kiwi Bert Laing won the Phelan Shield for the first time after they beat Papakura18-8 in the final. The Phelan Shield at this time was played for by the teams which had been knocked out of the Roope Rooster. Richmond Rovers won the reserve grade competition (Norton Cup) after they were tied with Mount Albert United after the final round and a final was necessary to decide the champion. Richmond won the match 16–10. They also won the Stallard Cup when they won the reserve grade knockout competition beating Marist 18–7 in the final. The Senior B competition (Sharman Cup) was comfortably won by Otahuhu Rovers who finished 5 competition points ahead of Green Lane. Ellerslie United won the Walmesley Shield which was the senior B knockout competition although this season it was played over 2 full rounds.\nClaude Dempsey, the Newton fullback, and former NZ international player was awarded the J.F.W. Dickson's medal for being the most sportsmanlike player in the senior grade. Junior awards went to J. Means and J. McWilliams.\nThe representative season saw Auckland play three matches. They defeated a Rest of the North Island side easily by 67 points to 14. They then beat the returning New Zealand team which had toured Australia by 21 points to 13. Then in August they defeated Canterbury 28–22 at Carlaw Park. The North Island team which beat the South Island was dominated by Auckland players with only Joe Cootes (Wellington) being from outside Auckland. They thrashed the South Island 55 points to 2. Unsurprisingly 18 of the New Zealand team selected to tour Australia were Auckland players. The Auckland Māori team played just one match which was against an Auckland Pākehā side and ran out 26 to 21 winners.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League meeting and news.\nPreliminary meeting.\nAt a meeting on February 17 the Auckland Rugby League decided to start the senior competition at the early date on April 2 due to the tour of New Zealand to Australia during the season. The date for the annual meeting was set at March 23. At the conclusion of the meeting they inspected the new lighting which has been installed at Carlaw Park in order to accommodate night football.\nAnnual general meeting.\nThe report which was to be presented at the annual general meeting showed that the balance sheet for the Auckland Rugby League was £3605s at the end of the 1937 season which was an increase of £21 on the previous season. There was an excess of assets over liabilities of £7598 12s 9d. At the annual meeting on March 23 Mr. John A. Lee presided as president. He said \"last year the code made great progress... and we are opening the greatest season we have ever had. Co-operation and good spirit shown by players and officials was to a large degree responsible for this success... after years of difficultly last year we reached the strength to warrant a team being sent and tested on the playing fields of Australia... great responsibility rests with the officials to see that a fine team be sent this season\". He went on to declare \"that league was a democratic code. No class distinction could enter if the game was to progress. He paid tribute to the great work of the ladies’ committees, whose social activities during the year did much to aid the code\". Mr. G. Grey Campbell, chairman of the control board, said \"it was pleasing to note that there had been no incidents at Carlaw Park last year, and not a single senior player had come before the board for irregular conduct on the field. During the summer improvements had been made at Carlaw Park, and the system of flood lighting, which was so successful for sports events, would make night football possible\". Tribute was paid to Ivan Culpan who had been secretary for the league for 20 years. During the meeting Archie Ferguson appealed for more senior matches to be played on outside grounds, particularly at the Devonport Domain with Mr. Campbell saying that the matter would be considered. Along with John A. Lee, four other members of parliament were also present, including Messrs, William Theophilus Anderton, Frederick William Schramm, Arthur George Osborne, and Arthur Shapton Richards who all \"spoke of the success of the code in Auckland\". The following officers were elected:- Patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice-patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, Mr. John A. Lee, M.P.; vice presidents, Sir Ernest Davis, Messrs. R.D. Bagnall, R. Benson, J Donald, O. Blackwood, T.S. Bellamy, C. Drysdale, H. Grange, R.J. Laird, W.J. Lovett, E. Morton, E. Montgomery, T.G. Symonds, Joe Sayegh, C. Seagar, Frederick William Schramm M.P., W. Wallace, H. Walmsley, R.H. Wood, G.T. Wright, W.H. Brien, L. Coakley, H. Luke; trustees, Messrs. A. Stormont, Edward John Phelan, G. Grey Campbell; deputy-chairman, Edward John Phelan; club delegates, Messrs, F. McAneny, T. Davis, J.W. Probert, Jim Rukutai; chairman junior control board, Mr. D. Wilkie; auditor, Mr. R.A. Spinley; honorary physicians, Drs. M.G. Pezaro, F.J. Gwynne, K.H. Holdgate, J.N. Waddell, G.W. Lock, H. Burrell, W. Bridgman, S. Morris; board of control, Messrs. G. Grey Campbell (chairman), D. Wilkie, R. Doble, T. Davis, J.W. Probert, Jim Rukutai, J. McAneny, J.E. Knowling, and Ivan Culpan.\nAnnual ball.\nThe Auckland Rugby League held their annual ball at the Peter Pan Cabaret on September 28. The Eastern Suburbs team which was touring Auckland at the time were honorary guests.\nAuckland Rugby League life memberships.\nJim Clark.\nOtahuhu nominated Jim Clark, who had recently been elected as returning president of their club as a life member of Auckland Rugby League. The league agreed and he was elected a life member of the ARL. It was stated that he \"had been actively identified with the game for 25 years and had given much service as an official in the Otahuhu district for some years past. It was mentioned that Mr. Clark was an international, having twice played with New Zealand teams in Australia\".\nFrank Thompson.\nAt the board of control meeting on June 22 Frank Thompson was made a life member. He joined the code in 1913 through the Remuera club. Thompson was an ex-member of the Referees’ Association for 17 years and spent 5 years on the grading, examination and appointment board. He also spent four years as a selector and six years with the junior management. Thompson was also a member of the New Zealand Referees’ Association for 10 years as a representative of the Auckland and the Northland leagues. He was also heavily involved in the acquisition and formation of Carlaw Park.\nRugby league ground allocation.\nOn April 14 the Auckland Park and Reserves Committee met to allocate fields to the various winter codes. The chairman of the committee was Ted Phelan who was also on the Auckland Rugby League board. The fields allocated to rugby league were Cricket Ground (2), Outer Domain (1), Victoria Park (1), Walker Park (2), Western Springs (2), Grey Lynn Park (1), with ‘Stadium’ reserved. It was commented that there was a \"spirit of harmony\" between the codes.\nGeorge Gillett donated trophy.\nIn June, former All Black and NZ rugby league international George Gillett, donated a \"handsome silver cup to the Auckland Rugby League for any competition which the league may desire. The trophy was presented through Mr. H. Walmsley\". It was decided during the season to award the trophy to the winner of the 4th grade competition which was ultimately City Rovers.\nPapakura promoted to the Fox Memorial competition.\nAt the annual meeting on March 23 it was announced that Papakura were being promoted from the Senior B grade which they had won comfortably for 2 years in a row to the Fox Memorial competition. Their backs would include Richard and A. Burgess, E Cossey, G Osborne, Phillips, J McInnes and Martin though it was said that their \"strength will probably be in the forwards\". While J Fogarty, D Evans, Buckeridge, C Ross, and Slater made a \"good impression\" in their preliminary match against Marist. It was rumoured that Cliff Satherley may also play for them. He didn't though former New Zealand representative Norm Campbell did play a handful of games to begin the season.\nGeorge Nepia joins Manukau.\nOn March 10 it was reported that George Nepia would join the Manukau club. He would arrive in Onehunga later in March and would be accompanied by Tuhoro, who was \"last year's outstanding forward for East Coast and Hawke's Bay\". The Manukau team would be extremely strong with the selectors saying that their senior side would be selected from George Nepia, Jack Hemi, Rangi Chase, Angus Gault, Jack Brodrick, Walter Brimble, Tom Chase, Pita Ririnui, Jack Broughton, R. Wilson, McKinlay, Peter Mahima, Whye, Tuhoro (2), Kakau, Tane, and Phillips. It was then reported in late March that there were doubts that he would in fact play for Manukau however he ultimately did for a few weeks.\nSenior team preseason and prospects.\nOn March 26 several teams held organised practices with the Manukau side playing a South Auckland XIII at Waikaraka Park. Newton, Marist, City, and Ponsonby all practised at Carlaw Park while Richmond were at Grey Lynn Park. It was reported that Ponsonby were to be coached by Bill Davidson who was a past City Rovers player who also represented Auckland 14 times from 1920 to 1923 and New Zealand 16 times from 1919 to 1921.\nIt was reported that Richmond Rovers had erected a dressing and club rooms at Grey Lynn Park and that the senior team would be a strong one with Mervyn Devine joining the forwards. He was a Wellington Rugby representative. However Ted Mincham was transferring from Richmond to Mount Albert. They would still have the services of \"Powell, Bickerton, and Wally Tittleton for their inside backs who know when others play well and Wally Tittleton is particularly clever at taking the gap and improving a movement for the men outside him. The form showed [after the preliminary games] by Mills and Abbie Graham, two of the juniors can earn them permanent places in the senior team, [while] Furnell was the most improved full back in Auckland last season\".\nThe Manukau side was considered to be shaping as \"a very formidable team\" with the \"forwards particularly strong, and perhaps the heaviest ever seen in club football. The average weight will be nearly 14 stone. This should be a great season for Jack Brodrick, whose brilliant form in the Māori match against Australia last year, stamps him as the finest forward seen in the code for many years\". They were also adding Pita Ririnui and \"he should soon rise to All Black honours\" according to the Auckland Star reporter. After their first preliminary game (which he did not play in) it was reported that Jack Hemi \"expressed a desire to play for Ponsonby, but the transfer might cause some difficulty\". After the match the Auckland Star said that Ririnui \"made a good impression on his first appearance and Brodrick, the best forward in Auckland last year, appears to be already in good form\". Mahika Panapa, the North Auckland Rugby Maori representative halfback signed on to play for Manukau prior to their first Fox Memorial game. In mid May, J. Craig, a representative rugby player from Nelson arrived in Auckland to join the Manukau club. He had represented the combined Nelson-Golden Bay-Motueka-Marlborough side who played the Springboks in 1937.\nMarist were reportedly gaining the services of Robert Grotte who was a former member and who had played as halfback for the St. George club in Sydney. After the first preliminary game they were said to be one of the strongest teams in the competition. \"In Haslam they have one of the best pivotal players in Auckland and in Halsey and Midgley very speedy wings... Grotte, the former Sydney player looks like being certain of a place. In Anderson, Butler and Breed they have a fine trio of forwards.\nPonsonby would have a similar team to the previous season with a strong backline and the forwards strengthened by J. Fraser from Taranaki who was said to be a \"splendid place-kick\". They had virtually the same backline as in the previous season and had gained the services of Clark who was a \"young player from Ellerslie [who had] the making of a good fullback.\nMount Albert were a suggested location for Bob Banham as they needed a \"link between the rugged Mount Albert forwards and the inside backs, where the weakness lay last season\". Ted Mincham joined Mount Albert from Richmond and \"with McNeil and McCallum outside him the Mount Albert three-quarter line should be a bit of a problem for their opponents... [while] their forwards appear to be just as strong as last season\". They were to be coached by former New Zealand player Stan Prentice. Following the first preliminary round of games at Carlaw Park on April 2 it was said that they \"have a good solid pack of forwards and have an exceptional back in R. Burgess who has great dash and pace [and that they] will further strengthen their team for the competition matches. It is probable that they will gain Lilburn, a good five eighths from Hunua. McRobbie, the Pokeno forward, while there is a possibility that Cliff Satherley, the former Richmond and Mount Albert forward will lead the pack. In mid May it was reported that Mount Albert had signed R.F. Ball who was a member of the Eastern Suburbs club in Sydney.\nNewton had had a relatively poor 1937 season though they had improved as the season went on. They had retained the services of Wilfred Brimble and Ted Brimble, and Crooks. While \"Kendall, a full back from North Auckland showed promise\", they also had a \"fairly good pack of forwards who stuck to their work well in the preliminary match\".\nCity were said after the first preliminary game to \"not appear to be exceptionally strong, and they will miss both Hawea Mataira and Donald, who were their best forwards last year. However, Hutchinson's form at the base of the scrum is excellent, Cyril Wiberg can be relied upon to gather points consistently with accurate goal kicking and the forwards may shake down into a solid combination\".\nNorth Shore were said to have a young team. With \"much interest taken in the appearance of Verdun Scott, whose cricket deeds are so well known. Scott played full back last season and is also a promising centre three-quarter\". Jack Smith who made a good impression at five eighths, is again available. Zane and Rhodes, of last years team, will also be playing. The forwards will include Simpson, Souter, Hunt and players from lower grades.\nSprigs.\nIt was decided to appoint a special committee to inspect players boots on Saturday's after St John Ambulance staff complained about injuries received by two players as the result of dangerous sprigs following the April 2 matches. The committee to inspect the boots each Saturday would be made up of Messrs. Mincham, Probert, and McAneny.\nInjury substitutions.\nAt the June 8 meeting of the control board the Referees’ Association said that they would \"appreciate a ruling in regard to replacements\". There was a suspicion that \"a certain club had a player who came late, but another player conveniently \"became injured\" to allow the late player to enter play\". While at a different game a player left the field stating he had influenza, while other cases where players had gone \"off without advising the referee\". Mr Campbell agreed that if a player was not seriously injured then they or the team captain should report to the referee before a replacement can be made. And that \"a referee would be entitled to hold a game up to get a report from an ambulance man or doctor if there was ground for believing that injury was being shammed\". It was then decided that a committee consisting of the chairman and Messrs. D. Wilkie and W. Mincham would submit a recommendation.\nJunior football changes.\nAt a meeting of the junior management board on February 8 several suggestions were discussed in regards to changes that could be made for the 1938 season. The main changes suggested were a proposal to reduce the age limit for the 6th grade to 18 years, introducing an age limit of 19.5 years for the 5th grade, and starting an open grade for the \"first juniors, with a weight limit of 11st 7lb [73 kg], to obviate the need for two sections in the third grade\". At their annual meeting on March 8 the proposals were debated and it was eventually decided to adopt them. Additional ones included that the age limit for the 6th grade be 18 and for the 7th grade be 16. The season would start for juniors on April 30.\nRichmond club rooms opened at Grey Lynn Park.\nIn early May the Richmond club applied to celebrate the opening of their clubrooms at Grey Lynn Park on June 4 by holding a match with South Auckland on its bye date. On June 4 they were officially opened by Mr. J.A. Lee prior to a game against a combined team from Huntly. Lee said \"this is going to be a permanent home, and it is an object worthy of the highest praise\". While Joe Sayegh said that the Richmond club had \"done yeoman service in the interests of the players. He was pleased to say that the City Council was only too pleased to encourage similar buildings on other public properties\". Mr. Swift expressed the club's thanks to Mr. Ralph Jenkinson who supervised the building construction.\nLawson Park developed.\nIt was announced in mid March that Lawson Park would be developed. It would involve \"earthworks of which will take from four to five months to complete. After this stage both areas have to be grassed and other finishing touches added\". It had been started four years earlier \"as a means of creating work in the district for the local unemployed, but was halted when sustenance was introduced. Some months ago work was recommenced, giving work for 20 men. When it is finished, it will provide two basketball [better known as netball at this time] and two tennis courts on a higher level, and on the lower part a rugby or rugby league football ground\". It was said that \"to provide for the football ground, a good deal of excavation will be necessary, so that ultimately a fine, natural grandstand will be secured\". Twenty nine years later, in 1967 the New Lynn Rugby League club was established and Lawson Park became its home ground with their club rooms being built there.\nAuckland representative team.\nIn March the Auckland Rugby League board of control offered the Auckland representative coaching position to Bob Banham, the New South Wales representative five-eighths. A cable was received back from him accepting the position and he was expected to arrive in time for the matches on April 8. The board intended to place Banham in a local team \"for playing purposes\". It was reported that he had been unlucky to miss out on selection in the 1937 Australian team which toured England and he had also turned down an offer to coach Queensland. In early march it was decided to place Banham in the North Shore Albions side for six weeks and then review the placement. After six matches for North shore it was decided to leave him there for 3 more weeks before moving to and coaching the City team. Bert Avery, Hec Brisbane, and A Renwick were appointed selectors for Auckland for the season while Brisbane was nominated by Auckland to be one of the three selectors for the North Island side.\nObituary.\nGeorge Seagar (snr).\nIn August George Seagar died aged 73. He had two sons who both represented New Zealand, George Seagar and Allan Seagar. George senior was a strong supported of rugby league and was an original vice-president of the Auckland Rugby League. He was later made a life member in recognition of his services to the game. He was survived by a wife, seven sons and three daughters, with 25 grandchildren and one great grandchild.\nEastern Suburbs Tour.\nIn September/October the NSWRFL runner up Eastern Suburbs side toured Auckland. They played four matches against Marist Old Boys, Manukau, Richmond Rovers, and South Auckland. Their only loss was in the match against Richmond who had accumulated a remarkable record against touring Australian club teams.\nMarist v Eastern Suburbs.\nJoseph (Joe) Charles Woods for Marist broke his leg in the second half. He was aged 28 and was taken to Auckland Hospital. Marist was captained by Reginald Haslam. Among the 6 try scorers for Eastern Suburbs, 5 were Australian internationals.\nManukau v Eastern Suburbs.\nJack Hemi was unavailable for Manukau due to illness while they lost Jack Brodrick to a shoulder injury during the first half.\nSenior first grade competitions.\nPreliminary round.\nMervyn William Devine, the former Wellington rugby representative made his debut for the Richmond team.\nFox Memorial results.\nMarist won the competition when they defeated Newton in the final round. Had they lost there would have been a three-way tie for first with themselves, Mount Albert, and Newton all on 22 points from 11 wins each but their 10–7 win saw them outright winners with 12 wins and 4 losses. A key to their win was their defence which saw them only concede 121 points from 16 games, an average of less than 8 points per game. From round 7 until round 18 their points conceded was 8, 7, 2, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 4, 11, and 7.\nRound 1.\nPapakura played in their first ever Fox Memorial game in round 1. They lost a close match 17–14 against Richmond. In the match between Newton and Manukau the referee (J. Cottingham) was knocked out after a ball which had been kicked struck him in the face from point blank range. Percy Rogers who was waiting to referee the following match took over and refereed the last 10 minutes. Former New Zealand player, Norm Campbell debuted for Papakura, though he would only play a handful of matches before retiring from the sport.\n Rangi Chase was forced to leave the field with a shoulder injury.\nRound 3.\nThree players were sent off in the Manukau-Marist match as a result of an \"on field incident\". Jack Whye of Manukau was suspended for a week, Bill Breed of Marist was \"severely reprimanded\", while Bill Glover also of Marist was unable to attend the disciplinary hearing and was ordered to stand down until able to attend. In the match between City and Ponsonby, D Black of Ponsonby broke his knee cap and was ruled out for the season. They also lost Pat Young, and Frank Halloran to injuries during the match. They had previously lost former Kiwi Arthur Kay to a leg injury in an earlier match.\nRound 4.\nRichmond defeated North Shore after a late try awarded after an obstruction. However the referee allowed the ball carrier to run behind the posts with the conversion taken from in front. The rules stated that the kick should have been taken from inline with where the obstruction occurred. The league ordered the match to be replayed if required later in the season. As it turned out the match did not need to be replayed as it would have no bearing on the championship. Bob Banham had to retire during the match after receiving a cut above the eye after colliding with an opponent which required three stitches. Arthur McInnarney scored his first senior points for Mt Albert. He would be selected for New Zealand in 1939.\nRound 6.\nA highlight of the round was the debut appearance of George Nepia for Manukau in their win over Richmond. It was said that he had a \"sound game\" but did not look match fit. Pita Ririnui was sent off for Manukau and Alf Broadhead for Richmond near the end of the game for fighting. They were both severely cautioned by the control board with Broadhead warned that a similar offence would be dealt with more severely. Also during the match Jack Brodrick went off to have a dislocated finger attended to. When he came back on he found that he had been replaced and so referee Maurice Wetherill made him leave the field once more. A notable feature in the North Shore – Papakura game was that a total of 10 penalty goals were kicked. The goal kicking in the senior grade was arguably the strongest it has ever been with John Anderson, Jack Hemi, Jack Smith, and J McInnes kicking a large number of goals most weeks.\nRound 7.\nNew Zealand representatives, Jack and Dick Smith were both absent for North Shore after their father passed away during the week. Bob Banham had been moved by the Auckland Rugby League from the North Shore club to City Rovers where he played for the remainder of the season.\nRound 8.\nPapakura recorded their first ever win in the Fox Memorial competition with an 18–15 win over Manukau on Carlaw Park 2. Manukau were missing several of their best players who were on the New Zealand tour of Australia but still fielded a strong side. During the match Richard Burgess of Papakura fractured his left arm. Reginald Haslam was ordered off for Marist in their 13–7 win over Ponsonby. Ernie Pinches scored a try for Mt Albert in his first season for them. He had been born in England in 1914 before moving to New Zealand. He became well known for wrestling, holding the New Zealand light heavyweight title for 6 years in the 1950s. In the same decade he was elected to the Mt Roskill Borough Council. He was deputy mayor there from 1974 to 1987 and acting mayor from 1987 to 1988.\nRound 9.\nIn the match between Papakura and Mount Albert, the Papakura player Dobbyn had his nose broken. He was able to return to play a week later however. \nRound 10.\nThe Papakura – Richmond match was played at Prince Edward Park in Papakura. The scores were level 10–10 in the second half when both A Burgess and G Crocker left the field injured leaving Papakura with just 11 players. Richmond went on to win 16–10.\nRound 12.\nPrime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage was a guest of the Auckland Rugby League and came to Carlaw Park to watch some of the play. He was accompanied by president John .A. Lee and along with his party was \"entertained at an afternoon tea organised by the ladies’ social committee\". L Cootes of Ponsonby was ordered off for striking a City opponent. In the same match Turi Albert Macpherson broke his leg when he collided with a Ponsonby forward.\nRound 13.\nDuring the Mount Albert – Marist game Arthur McInnarney and MacLachlan collided while trying to field a kick which allowed Marist to score a try giving them the lead. McInnarney had to leave the field with an injured leg as a result of the collision. In the Richmond game with North Shore six players had to leave the field with injuries. North Shore had to play two short in the second half. Dick Smith and Verdun Scott were amongst those who had to go off, along with Powell. During the week Richmond lost the services of Frank Furnell who transferred to Wellington. He was replaced at fullback by Trevor Bramley.\nRound 15.\nLaurie Mills (aged 20) was concussed in the Richmond – Manukau game and was taken to hospital. He would later be killed in action during World War 2. In the Marist game with City Bob Banham went off injured in the first half for City, while Jackie Rata and Jackson went off in the second half. Remarkably in the North Shore v Papakura match the referee was Ted Mincham who had spent the first half of the season playing for Mount Albert seniors. He would surely have been one of the only players ever to play and referee in the same competition during a season. He would however play senior football again for Richmond during the war years.\nRound 16.\nRichard Shadbolt was sent off for Mount Albert during the first half of their match with Manukau. They also lost Charles Dunne and A MacLachlan through injuries meaning that for nearly 30 minutes they had to play with just 10 men.\nRound 17.\nThe Auckland match against Canterbury was played on the same day at Carlaw Park with the club matches providing the curtain-raisers. Richmond and Manukau did not play on the day and the Auckland team was made exclusively from their teams. In the match between Mount Albert and City, Jack Tristram and Bob Banham were ordered off from each team respectively after an incident between them.\nRound 18.\nBy virtue of their win over Newton, Marist claimed the Fox memorial title for 1938. Roy Hardgrave made an appearance for Mount Albert after recently returning to Auckland from his time playing professionally in England and France.\nRoope Rooster (knockout competition).\nRound 2.\nIn the match between North Shore and Marist, H Simpson (North Shore), K Finlayson (Marist), and J Woods (Marist) were all sent from the field.\nPhelan Shield.\nRound 1.\nIn the Mount Albert match with Marist, Joseph Gunning and Richard Shadbolt were both sent off for Mount Albert and William Grotte was sent off for Marist. Jack Donovan refereed the Mt Albert v Marist game, with his brother Phil scoring a try for Marist in their 6-5 loss.\nRound 2.\nIn addition to the 2 Phelan Shield matches Marist played Ponsonby in a practice game on the No. 2 field as preparation for their match against the touring Eastern Suburbs side, while Ponsonby was still in the Phelan Shield and preparing for their semi-final match. Marist won 20 points to 14. Robert Marshall, the wicket keeper for the Auckland representative cricket side, scored a try in Mt Albert's loss to Manukau.\nStormont Shield (champion of champions).\nDuring the match 21 year old Maurice Potter of the Richmond side was concussed and taken to hospital though his condition was reported to not be serious. He was replaced by Frank Furnell who had returned from Wellington.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, Phelan Shield and Stormont Shield matches which all first grade sides were eligible for competing in (provided they avoided elimination from the knock out competitions). The top point scorer for the third consecutive season was John Anderson with 82. Jack Hemi (Manukau) only 2 points behind, with and J McInnnes (Papakura) 2 further back with 78, while Jack Smith had 60. Anderson, Hemi, and Smith all went on the New Zealand tour of Australia mid-season which meant they missed 6 Fox Memorial games so their point totals were significantly below than what they would have been.\nSenior reserve competitions.\nThe early round results were not reported while several later rounds also only had sporadic reporting. Richmond and Mount Albert were tied after 18 rounds necessitating a final between the two teams which Richmond won by 16 points to 10.\nNorton Cup results.\nIn the opening round match between Mount Albert and Ponsonby at Grey Lynn, Norman Drew fractured his ankle.\nSenior B grade competitions.\nSharman Cup results.\nThe round 1 match between Otahuhu and Point Chevalier at Walker Park was called off by the referee with Otahuhu in the lead by 25 points to 13. The match was awarded to Otahuhu with Point Chevalier's approval. Earlier in the season the Point Chevalier club had seen floodlights added to its ground at Walker Park for the first time. Manukau entered a team after round 1 but they defaulted their round 2 match against Ellerslie (this match was then removed from the records) and then withdrew from the competition.\nOtahuhu won the competition and their final round match was against Green Lane (who finished runner up) at Carlaw Park on July 16. The match was a curtain-raiser to the Auckland – New Zealand match. Not all of the results were reported in the newspapers however at the conclusion of the competition the Auckland Star reported that the teams finished on the following competition points: Otahuhu 19, Green Lane 14, Ellerslie 12, Point Chevalier 7, Northcote 6, R.V. 2.\nWalmsley Shield (knockout competition).\nDue to the amount of time left in the season following the conclusion of the Sharman Cup it was decided to play a full home and away competition for the Walmsley Shield. Very few results were reported and Point Chevalier dropped out of the competition after round 6. Ellerslie won the competition.\nOther club matches.\nManukau v South Auckland XIII.\nIn a preseason match Manukau played a South Auckland XIII at Waikaraka Park in Onehunga. Neither George Nepia or Jack Hemi played in the match but Manukau won a \"fast and interesting contest\".\nLower Grades.\nRichmond won the Davis Shield for the most championship points in all grades which they had won for several consecutive years, while Otahuhu won the Tracy Inglis trophy for most points in the junior grades.\nIt was noted by the chairman of the schools’ committee, Mr. A.E. Stanley at the end of the season at the final control board meeting that \"eight years ago there were seven school teams in Auckland, while in the season just closed there were 41 teams in the three grades\".\nSchoolboys\nA schoolboy gala was held at Carlaw Park on the 22nd of October. Competing teams in the 7-a-side tournament were St. Patricks, George Court's (2), Ellerslie (2), Richmond, Ponsonby, Green Lane, Point Chevalier, Balmoral, Northcote, Manukau, Newton, Glenora, and Marist. The team from Ponsonby won the knockout competition when they defeated Ellerslie in the final. Ponsonby were presented with the Robert Reid Memorial Shield for winning the championship during the year, and the Wilson trophy for their knockout tournament win. The most improved 7-a-side player was named as J. Stackpole from Newton. The J. Gedye Cup went to S. Callagher of Richmond, while D. White of Ponsonby won the Don Cleverley Medal. The Marist team was presented with medals by Mr. C.L.M. Green, while J. Scott of the North Shore side was presented with the Sam Dickie Cup for goalkicking in the intermediate grade.\nThe results shown in the tables are based on scores reported in the New Zealand Herald, Auckland Star and Franklin Times so are very incomplete as many clubs did not submit results.\n3rd Grade.\nThe 3rd Grade was split into 2 sections due to the number of teams. North Shore won section 1 and Richmond won section 2. Both teams played a home and away series to decide the overall 3rd grade champion with Richmond winning the first match 8-2 and the second match 8-3 to take the title on August 6 and August 13 respectively. Northcote and Richmond met in the final of the knockout competition on September 10 but the result was not reported in the newspapers. Ultimately Richmond finished the season winning 16 from 16 including their knockout matches, scoring 452 points and conceding just 52.\n4th Grade (Hospital Cup).\nIt was decided to substitute the Hospital Cup for the fourth grade championship with the George Gillett Cup which had been presented to the league by George A. Gillett earlier in the season. City won the championship. Otahuhu won the knockout competition with an 11-7 win on September 10 over City. It was unclear when the knockout competition began as all teams continued to play matches until the end of the season.\n5th Grade (Endean Shield).\nMount Albert won the championship with a 14-0 win over Green Lane on September 10. Green Lane met Richmond in the knockout competition final which ran from September 10 to October 8 but the result was not reported. \n6th Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nPonsonby won the championship. On August 20 Ponsonby beat Richmond 7-3 but the match was ordered to be replayed. Ponsonby won the match on September 3 and then got to play Marist in a playoff for the title. Ponsonby won easily by 18 points to 0. On June 11 Richmond beat Avondale 6-3 however they had fielded an over age player. The player in question had provided their younger brothers birth certificate and had been registered by the ARL. Richmond argued that the ARL was complicit if they were. The league eventually decided to replay the game. The replay was on August 6 and Richmond won 8-4 after having won the original match 6-3. Richmond won the knockout competition when they beat Otahuhu 32 to 8 on September 17.\n7th Grade (Myers Cup).\nRichmond won the championship and the knockout title with a 15-5 win over City on August 20. They played a friendly match against Hikurangi from Northland on September 3 and won 15-5.\nSchoolboy competitions.\nThe majority of teams were affiliated with a club side and were made up of schoolboys from that areas schools rather than one school in particular.\nSenior (Lou Rout Trophy).\nRichmond won the championship and the knockout competition (Stanley Cup) when they beat Mount Albert 18-6 on October 1. In late July a senior Auckland schoolboys team was selected to play against the South Auckland (Waikato) side for the Golden Bloom banner. The side included future New Zealand representatives Ron McGregor and George Davidson, and other future senior players. The team was:- Morrie Brockliss (Northcote), A. Speedy (Otahuhu), N. Green (Avondale), V. Ryall, Ron McGregor (Richmond), J. Sorby (Newton), Colin Riley (Green Lane), A. Hayson (Ponsonby); forwards, G. Lewis, K. Jarvis (Point Chevalier), A. Clark (Glenora), R. Fielder (Green Lane), George Davidson (Mount Albert), K. Lorrigan (Newton), J. Brien (Newton).\nIntermediate championship (Newport Shield).\nRichmond won the championship (Newport Shield), and the Eccles Memorial Shield. They won the knockout competition when they beat Ponsonby 25-11 in the final on October 1, and a week later they beat Newton in the champion of champions match. Newton had finished runner up in the championship. St Patricks School on Wellington Street in Freemans Bay entered two teams in the competition after 5 weeks under the umbrella of the City Rovers club which was situated in the area.\nJunior championship (Robert Reid Memorial Shield).\nPonsonby won the competition when they beat Ellerslie in the final on October 22. Not all results were reported so their exact numbers in the standings are incomplete. St Patricks School on Wellington Street in Freemans Bay entered a side on August 20. Napier Street school also entered a team on August 20 but they only played a small number of fixtures and lost 2 games by default.\nRepresentative Fixtures.\nNorth Island v South Island (inter-island match).\nBrian Riley was initially named to play for the North Island side but as he was unable to get leave from work to potentially tour Australia if selected he was replaced in the North Island side.\nProbables v Possibles.\nThe Possibles team led 19–0 at halftime and so the selectors switched the forwards and three players who had started in the Possibles side scored points for the Probables in the second half (Bert Leatherbarrow, John Anderson, and Bill McNeight).\nAuckland Māori (Tamaki) v Auckland Pākehā.\nDuring the match 24 year old Joseph Alva Gunning received a kick to the head and went to Auckland Hospital with concussion. It was said that his condition was not serious however the New Zealand Herald reported two weeks later that he had only recently been discharged from hospital with the intention of playing in the upcoming weekend match for Mount Albert though he ultimately didn't return until their July 2 match. Ted Brimble, the Auckland Māori first five-eighth injured his leg in the first half and was replaced by Mihaka Panapa.\nAuckland Māori (Tāmaki) representative season.\nAuckland Māori only played one match during the season. The club competition ran much longer than it had in previous seasons and the New Zealand side went on a mid season tour of Australia meaning that there were relatively few opportunities for representative matches. On June 6 they played an Auckland Pākehā side at Carlaw Park and won 26 to 21.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) representative matches played and scorers.\nMihaka Panapa came on to replace Ted Brimble in their match just before half time after Brimble injured his leg.\nSenior grade registration and transfers.\nOn March 3 the following players were registered: Ian Mackenzie (ex King Country), and H.P.S.

The Winnipeg Victorias formed in the summer of 1915 when they took over the Winnipeg Rowing Club football team. The Victorias were a new team, as the Rowing Club continued to operate, naturally, as a rowing club. Prior the 1915 season the Victorias announced that they would not have a senior team, but did have teams at the intermediate, junior and juvenile levels. In 1924 they were first Winnipeg team to qualify for the Grey Cup. \"An internal disagreement over which railway to use ended up costing the team the right to play. The Victorias chose to suspend operations (in 1928) rather than join the new Tri-City Football League.

        "text": "Baye Modou Fall (born December 21, 2003) is a Senegalese college basketball player for the Kansas State Wildcats of the Big 12 Conference . At center, he stands and weighs . He was a consensus four-star recruit and one of the top players in the 2023 class.\nEarly life.\nFall grew up in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, mainly playing association football as a goalkeeper. He was always tall for his age, with his father standing at and his mother at . His older brother and uncle encouraged him to focus full-time on basketball at the age of 13, when they noticed he had potential on the court. When he was 15, Fall moved to the United States to join his cousin, Mamadou Sow, and their uncle in Denver, enrolling at Lincoln Academy Charter School to finish the eighth grade. The main reason for the move was an opportunity for a better education, with Fall hoping to be an architect. Unlike Sow, he already knew some English, though they both used social media and rap music to learn casual English and slang.\nIn March 2019, Fall made a strong first impression on scouts with a standout performance at the Pangos Junior All-American Camp, a showcase for the top middle school talent in the country. Basketball writer Frank Burlison, a member of the USBWA Hall of Fame, compared his dominance to that of Deandre Ayton's at the same event six years prior.\nHigh school career.\nFall followed his cousin and enrolled at Lutheran High School in Parker, Colorado. He averaged 19 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game while shooting 67 percent from the field as a freshman, leading his school to an appearance in the class 3A state quarterfinals. He earned second-team class 3A all-state and second-team MaxPreps Freshman All-American honors.\nAs a sophomore, Fall averaged 22.1 points, 10 rebounds, and 3.2 blocks per game, guiding Lutheran to a 16–1 record and a class 3A state title. He recorded 10 points, 11 rebounds, and six blocks in the championship game against St. Mary's. At the end of they year he was named class 3A state player of the year, MaxPreps Colorado Player of the Year, and a first-team MaxPreps Sophomore All-American. That summer he shared co-MVP honors with JJ Taylor at the 2021 Pangos All-American Camp Top30 game in Las Vegas.\nAhead of his junior season, Fall announced he was transferring to the newly-formed Denver Prep Academy, a member of the Grind Session national prep basketball league. However, after appearing in just ten games, he was dismissed from the team in February 2022 for a violation of team rules. He averaged 14.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game at the time of his dismissal. That summer, Fall averaged 18 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks a game for the Colorado Hawks in the Adidas 3SSB circuit. He was named co-MVP of the Pangos All-American Camp Top 30 All-Star Game in June, followed by a performance as the top scorer and rebounder at the NBAPA Top 100 Camp in July.\nFor his senior year, Fall enrolled at Accelerated Prep, another Denver-based private school competing in the Grind Session league as a new member. On January 24, 2023, Fall was selected as a McDonald's All-American.\nRecruiting.\nFall was a consensus four-star recruit and one of the top players in the 2023 class, according to major recruiting services. He received his first offer from Minnesota when he was still in the eighth grade. By the end of his freshman season at Lutheran he also held offers from Georgia, Georgetown and Kansas. In August 2022, Fall announced that he had trimmed his list of schools to seven: Arkansas, Auburn, Colorado, Kansas State, Rutgers, Seton Hall and Texas. He had received more than 30 offers at this point. On November 15, 2022, Fall committed to playing college basketball for Arkansas."

At the most recent 2021 World Championships, Norway again took the gold.\nOn the 2021–2022 World Cup circuit, four relays were run before the Olympics across different stops: three were won by Norway, and one by Russia.\nRace.\nAn exciting competition, the pre-race favorite team from Norway had a disastrous first leg from Sturla Holm Lægreid, who missed four times while shooting in the standing position, forcing a penalty lap and opening the door for the ROC, France, and Belarus squads to stake an early lead.\nThroughout the second leg, the ROC continued skiing strong and shooting well, while Norway dropped all the way back to an almost unthinkable 1:40 deficit behind leader Alexander Loginov from the ROC. A tight battle emerged between Émilien Jacquelin of France and Roman Rees of Germany behind Loginov while Belarus, Italy, Canada, and Sweden fell further back and away from medal contention.\nThe third leg saw more of the same, as perfect shooting from Maxim Tsvetkov kept the ROC well clear of the chasing pack. Behind Tsetkov, Johannes Thingnes Bø led a strong comeback for the Norwegians, as the multi-gold medalist's 19:10.9 proved to be the fastest leg of the day, bringing the favorites Norway back into medal contention. France and Germany kept pace, reducing the race for three medals down to four likely candidates.\nOn the fourth and final leg, ROC's Eduard Latypov continued to lead going into the last shooting section, entering the checkpoint with a 0:50 lead over France, Germany, and Norway. However, after a disastrous shooting where he missed four out of his first five shots, Latypov left the shooting area having to ski two penalty loops, effectively handing the race back over to the chasing pack.

The team scheduled its first game in mid-January so it would have a couple of weeks to practice together ahead of the match, a luxury the Big Red rarely possessed in recent years. The first game of the season, a contest against Columbia, was cancelled at the last minute, leaving Cornell with two games prior to the semester break. The opening game came against Colgate and the Maroons got the better of the Big Red once again. The team had to fix its problems quickly as the second game was just three days away. Unfortunately, Cornell was hopelessly outmatched by Clarkson and embarrassed to the tune of 0–10.\nCornell had to live with that loss for a full month before their next game. A rematch with Clarkson that was to be played on the 10th was cancelled due to weather. The temperature got so bad that even the rematch with Colgate had to be scrapped. Cornell ended up having to finish its season on the road and the lack of available ice for practice proved disastrous.

        "text": "William Pye is an American ice hockey coach and former goaltender who was an All-American for Northern Michigan and helped the team win its first National Championship in 1991.\nCareer.\nPye arrived in Marquette in the fall of 1987 and served as a backup to Mike Jeffrey in his freshman season. He took over the starting role at the start of his sophomore season and provided an immediate boost in goal. NMU went from 6th to 2nd in the WCHA and Pye led the Wildcats to their first WCHA Championship, capturing MVP honors. Northern Michigan wasn't able to make it out of the first round of the NCAA Tournament but the Buffalo Sabres had seen enough to select Pye in the 6th round of NHL Draft.\nPye had a rocky year as a junior, seeing his goals against average swell by more than a goal per game. The team managed a middling season and lost two overtime games in the conference tournament to finish in 4th place. In Pye's senior season, however, everything turned up roses. Northern Michigan won its first WCHA regular season title and Pye finished in the top 10 in the nation. He led the country with 32 wins and was named an All-American. In the postseason he shut down some of the strongest offenses in the country, enabling NMU to win their second WCHA title and became the only player to earn two WCHA tournament MVP's. Northern Michigan received a bye into the quarterfinal round of the NCAA Tournament and Pye proved solid in net while the offense ran over their opponents. NMU made its second championship appearance that year and the final game turned out to be one for the ages. Pye allowed three goals in the first but became a bulwark in the middle frame while the Wildcats scored five goals to take a commanding lead. Boston University, peppered with future NHL stars like Tony Amonte and Shawn McEachern, roared back with a 4-goal third and the two teams ended regulation with a 7–7 tie. The match became just the second championship game in history to need multiple overtime sessions and ended when Darryl Plandowski got the Wildcats the win in the third 10-minute extra frame.\nAfter graduating, Pye began his professional career in the Sabres' minor league system. The closest Pye got to playing in the NHL was as an emergency call-up on two occasions. In November 1992, Dominik Hašek was suffering from a groin injury and Pye sat on the bench in game against the Ottawa Senators. He was replaced the following day by Clint Malarchuk. Almost two months later both Darren Puppa and Dominik Hašek were injured and Pye was recalled to serve as a backup for Tom Draper. He remained with the Sabres for a week but didn't play in any of the games. Pye was never able to find his form in the pro game and was progressively demoted until landing in the WPHL in the mid-90's. Pye had three 20-win seasons over a 4-year span and decided to call it quits in 2000. Upon his retirement as a player, Pye founded the \"Billy Pye Goaltending Academy\" and continued to operate the business in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.\nWhile operating his business, Pye served as the goaltending coach for a few local junior teams, including the Wichita Falls Wildcats. He was inducted into the Northern Michigan Athletic Hall of Fame in 2007."

        "text": "Michael C. Brewer (born April 13, 1969) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman, forward and coach who was an All-American for Brown.\nEarly life.\nBrewer was born in Chisholm, Ontario. After high school Brewer joined the Brown Bears men's ice hockey team. The 1989 Bears won one game out of 26 in their first season under Bob Gaudet. Brewer finished tied for second in scoring as a freshman with just 13 points. The team recovered the following year, including Brewer more than doubling his point production. He was named first-team all-conference for leading the teams's turnaround. Brewer missed six games the following season while studying abroad but was named an alternate captain despite missing time. He had his best output as a senior, again leading the team in scoring and pushing the Bears up to fifth in ECAC Hockey. While the team did not advance past the conference quarterfinals, Brewer was instrumental in Brown's turnaround and was named an All-American for his final season.\nCareer.\nBrewer played for Team Canada for a season and then began his professional career in Europe. He saw moderate success with several teams in multiple countries but ended up retiring as a player in 1998. A decade later, while working as the head coach for Serbian junior teams, Brewer played 18 games for HK Vojvodina, his last appearance as a player.\nBrewer was inducted into the Brown Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.\nPersonal life.\nMike's father was Carl Brewer, an NHL defenceman who won three Stanley Cups with the Toronto Maple Leafs."

The Razorbacks played their home games in Barnhill Arena (then known as Razorback Fieldhouse) in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Arkansas competed in the Southwest Conference. It was former Razorback All-American Glen Rose's sixth season in his second stint as head coach of the Hogs and fifteenth season overall as Arkansas's coach. The Razorbacks tied for the Southwest Conference championship with a record of 9–5 against SWC teams and 17–10 overall. Arkansas earned the SWC's bid to the NCAA Tournament, but lost both its second-round game and regional consolation match. The Oklahoma State team that beat Arkansas in the Sweet Sixteen featured future Razorback head coach Eddie Sutton at point guard.\n1958 was Arkansas's fourteenth SWC Championship and its fifth NCAA Tournament appearance. Glen Rose won his fifth SWC championship as coach of the Razorbacks and the only conference championship of his second tenure as head coach. Arkansas was ranked in the AP Poll for the second time in program history on January 20, 1958. The Hogs were ranked for consecutive weeks for the first time ever when they were ranked for three straight weeks before losing to Rice and falling out of the polls. Senior Fred Grim was named First Team All-SWC, First Team All-District, and AP All-American Honorable Mention. Grim was drafted in the fifth round of the 1958 NBA draft by the Syracuse Nationals.\nRoster.\nRoster retrieved from HogStats.com.\nSchedule and Results.\nSchedule retrieved from HogStats.com.\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament"

The team was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 13th season.\nSeason.\nThe Cornell hockey team gathered together for the first time after the winter break. The team was looking forward to including some new blood from the freshman squad that had gone undefeated the year before. Unfortunately, the team wasn't able to get any practice in until just 5 days before their first game. The main problem was the same issue the team had faced since its inception: warm weather.\nWhen time came for their first game, the Big Red travelled to Syracuse to take on Colgate, who were using the Colosseum as their home rink. The lack of ice time hampered the Big Red and the team lost a close-fought game despite a strong performance from Oleg Petroff in net. The team was hoping to play a second game before the semester break, however, the poor ice conditions delayed the next game until early February.\nThe time off allowed the team to practice more while coach Bawlf continued to shuffle the lineup. The changes led to a win for the Big Red in their second game with Guthrie netting both goals in the victory. The rematch a few days later ended with a similar result and the team had a more impressive 6–3 win. The team's final game was against a very strong Hamilton squad and they was soundly beaten, 7–1.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He attended high school there at John Muir before playing college football at Stanford. He spent six years at Stanford, from 1930 to 1935, but did not play football until several years after he joined. After the 1935 season, Topping was named Second-team All-America by the Kansas City Star. He also was the year's Rose Bowl Most Valuable Player award winner, given the credit of Stanford's upset win over SMU. Assistant coach Jim Lawson said that \"Topping meant the difference between a win for them and a win for us.\" After his 1935 performance he was selected with the 11th pick of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Boston Redskins. He was their second ever selection and the first ever pick from Stanford. However, Topping did not play with Boston and instead joined the minor league Danbury Trojans, following an appearance in the 1936 College All-Star Game. He played two seasons with Danbury, appearing in 11 games, starting 9. Following his sports career, Topping became a sports writer and co-owner of two newspapers. He purchased the \"Hanford Morning Journal\" and \"Hanford Sentinel\" along with Stanley Beaubaire. A few years later he served in World War II on the island of Guam. Topping later was inducted into the Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame. He died on September 14, 1974, in Pasadena, at the age of 62."

        "text": "Karl Johnston (born August 11, 1967) is a Canadian constable and former ice hockey Defenseman who was an All-American for Lake Superior State and helped the Lakers win their first National Championship in 1988.\nCareer.\nJohnston began attending Lake Superior State University in 1987, joining the program just in time to help the Lakers win a national championship. Johnston finished second on the team in terms of scoring from the blueline and remained a mainstay on the defense for four years. His scoring output increased each year and LSSU made the NCAA Tournament each year he was with the club. As a senior, Johnston was named as an alternate captain and led the team to a program record 36 wins. Johnston was named to the All-American team and helped Lake State win the first conference championship in program history. Unfortunately, the top-seeded Lakers were upset in the national quarterfinals and Johnston's college career was over.\nAfter graduating, Johnston signed with the New York Islanders organization and began his professional career with the Springfield Indians. He remained with the club for about a season and a half before being demoted to the ECHL. While he played well, Johnston realized that he needed another career path and retired after the 1994 season. He returned to Ontario and began working as a police officer in St. Thomas. He continued that work while making several additional appearances as a player for the remainder of the decade but eventually hung up his skates for good in 1999. In 2003 Johnston joined the Ontario Provincial Police and has worked as a constable ever since (as of 2021)."

The Razorbacks played their home games in the Men's Gymnasium in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It was former Razorback All-American Glen Rose's eighth season as head coach of the Hogs. Arkansas won the Southwest Conference championship for the ninth time overall and first time since the 1937–38 season, finishing with a perfect 12–0 record in conference play and 20–3 overall. It was Arkansas's second perfect conference season (along with 1927–28) and its last until 1976–77. The Razorbacks did not lose a game against collegiate competition during the regular season, but lost two out of three games away from Fayetteville against the Amateur Athletic Union powerhouse Phillips 66ers. Arkansas was invited to the NCAA tournament for the first time (narrowly missing out on the inaugural tournament in 1939, with rival Texas winning the SWC by one game and gaining the league's bid to the tournament) and won its first ever NCAA Tournament game against Wyoming, 52–40. The Razorbacks advanced to their first ever Final Four, where they fell to eventual national runner-up, Washington State.\nMultiple Razorbacks had outstanding seasons, with Johnny Adams, Howard Hickey, and John Freiberger all garnering First Team All-SWC honors. Adams, a pioneer of the jump shot, was also recognized as a First Team All-American by Helms. Adams set the SWC scoring record during the February 21 game against with 36 points. Gordon Carpenter and R.C.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a center fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) before the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). The center fielder (CF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Center field is the area of the outfield directly in front of a person standing at home plate and facing beyond the pitcher's mound. The outfielders have to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Generally having the most territory to cover, the center fielder is usually the fastest of the three outfielders, although this can also depend on the relative strength of their throwing arms and the configuration of their home field, due to the deepest part of center field being the farthest point from the infield and home plate. The center fielder normally plays behind the shortstop and second baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, center fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.\nCenter fielders are most commonly credited with an assist when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Center fielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Center fielders also earn assists on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch. Outfielders record far fewer assists than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more assists in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Assists are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication about an outfielder's throwing arm than assists by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 1890s through 1920s, including the dead-ball era, due to that period's emphasis on more aggressive baserunning. The top six players were all active throughout the years from 1913 to 1921; only 11 of the top 37 players were active after 1953, and only six of them after 1984. Only six of the top 73 single-season totals were recorded after 1925, and only one after 1945; only nine of the top 163 have been recorded since 1955. Because game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics before 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate assist totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in career assists as a center fielder with 448, 173 more than any other player, and nearly two and a half times as many as any player active after 1931. Speaker also holds the single-season record of 35, which he accomplished twice; no player since 1955 has had more than 20, likely putting both of his marks among Major League Baseball's most unbreakable records. Andrew McCutchen, who had 63 assists through the 2022 season to place him tied for 105th all-time, is the leader among active players."

Led by Canada women's national basketball team assistant coach Carly Clarke the Rams went 109-57 between 2012 and 2020.\nWith the arrival of Clarke, she led the Rams into the OUA playoffs in her inaugural season. The 2014–15 season saw the greatest season in Rams history up to that time.

        "text": "The Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) is the players' union for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). It formed in 1998 and was the first trade union for female professional athletes.\nHistory.\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) was formed in 1998 after the end of the WNBA league's second season. Players were protesting average salaries of $30,000 () and lack of health care benefits, retirement plans, and revenue sharing. It was the first trade union for professional women athletes. According to its website it was the first trade union to ratify a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in women's professional sports. The union's first director was Pamela Wheeler.\nCollective bargaining agreements.\nThe WNBPA ratified its first CBA on 30 April 1999. According to its website it was the first CBA ratified in professional women's sports. It included provisions to raise the minimum salary for established players to $30,000 (from $15,000), health care benefits that extended to the off-season, a retirement plan, paid maternity leave, and revenue sharing.\nThe WNBPA threatened to strike in 2003 if a new deal was not worked out between players and the league. The result was a delay in the start of the 2003 preseason. The 2003 WNBA draft was also delayed.\nIn 2014 the league and the union made an 8-year collective bargaining agreement which allowed an opt-out after the 2019 season.\nIn January 2020, the league and the union announced they had reached a tentative agreement that represented a \"profound shift\" in compensation for players and the resources available to them. Under the agreement the average player salary would \"exceed six figures for the first time.\" The agreement also covered revenue sharing, travel standards, and maternity and childcare benefits. Billie Jean King, part owner of the Los Angeles Sparks, said the agreement would \"redefine what it means to be a professional female athlete today.” \"Sports Illustrated\" called it a \"groundbreaking, glass-ceiling-cracking\" agreement which was the \"first of its kind in pro sports\" in addressing the needs of working parents. The league expected the salary increase to benefit the WNBA by helping prevent players from resorting to off-season play in Europe, Asia, and Australia in order to increase their earnings, as the extra playing time increases the risk of injuries that may affect WNBA competition and the extended time working outside the US affects players' availability to promote the league off-season. Shortly afterward the union negotiated with the league on how to create the Wubble, a coronavirus bubble designed to allow the WNBA to play a shortened 2020 season.\nOther projects.\nShortly after the George Floyd protests began in 2020, the league and the players' union agreed to put Say Her Name and Black Lives Matter slogans on warmup gear and uniforms for opening weekend. On 6 July, the WNBA announced their pandemic-shortened season would be \"dedicated to social justice.\" In early July 2020, Atlanta Dream owner Senator Kelly Loeffler criticized the league's support for Black Lives Matter and asked the league commissioner Cathy Engelbert to drop support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Engelbert refused, releasing a statement saying the league would \"continue to use our platforms to vigorously advocate for social justice,\" and the WNBA and WNBPA announced the joint formation of the Social Justice Council by the league and union.\nRecognition.\nIn 2021 the NAACP gave the WNBPA their Jackie Robinson Award (shared with Steph Curry) in recognition for the union's work advocating for social justice."

So the men who provided you with your cup of tea buckled to. One European was put in charge of every 500 native labourers. Malaria risks were so great that the men worked for two months at a time, each batch then going back to the comparative comfort of the tea gardens while thie relief took over. Then the refugees came, fleeing from Burma.\nMen and women of many nationalities died on the way. Corpses piled up on the side of the jungle tracks. Vultures wheeled in the skies. It yet another job for the planters, their wives, tea garden labourers, tribesmen. \" There are 70,000 coming.' they were told one minute. \" There are 250,000 on the way.\" they were told the next minute. So they went to work in the wild Naga Hills, up in the 4,000 ft. high Hukawng Valley, in the Chaukan Pass 8,000 ft. up. Europeans had never passed through some of the country before. Head-hunters lurked the dark jungle. Dacoits were busy - killing, plundering. Camps were built and manned by white men and women. Elephants toiled up crazy precipice paths carrying quinine, bandages. Rafts were strung together from logs and thatch to carry the straggling, pitiful refugees across roaring, bridgeless rivers. Planters waded waist deep through quagmires to succour the injured; doctors from the tea plantations fought epidemics.\n\"They carried out heroic rescues of refugees marooned in the foodless, trackless jungle wilderness.\" says one report I was allowed read in Lombard-street. \"Many suffered severely in health. Some died. But their lives were not given in vain. Some 220,000 refugees were brought to safely.\"\nAndrew Lindsay was given an O.B.E. for his part of helping save the lives of many of those refugees that came to the Indian Tea Association plantations.\nFamily.\nHis parents were Rev. George Lindsay (1846-1933) from Cortachy in Angus; and Jessie Fawns Mollison (1858-1950) from New Zealand. Rev. Lindsay had emigrated to New Zealand; and they married on 5 Jun 1878 there.\nGeorge and Jessie had a daughter and five sons, including Andrew.\nAndrew Lindsay married Ethel Eliz Goddard (1881-1964) on 1 March 1918 in Mumbai, India at the Afghan Memorial Church in Colaba. Ethel was the younger daughter of W. H. Goddard of Folkestone, England."

        "text": "Ice hockey in Seattle, Washington includes professional teams as early as 1915, such as the Seattle Metropolitans, the first United States-based team to win the Stanley Cup. The city has been represented by various teams in the iterations of the Western Hockey League since 1944, of which the major junior Seattle Thunderbirds are the latest. \nPresently, the city has a National Hockey League franchise, the Seattle Kraken, who began play in the 2021–22 season.\nThere is also a history of both professional minor-league and junior teams in nearby cities of the Puget Sound region, such as Everett and Tacoma.\nSeattle Metropolitans (1915–1924).\nProfessional ice hockey in Seattle dates back to 1915, with the formation of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA)'s Seattle Metropolitans. \nEarly PCHL teams (1928–1945).\nThe closure of the Seattle Ice Arena in 1924, which ended the Metropolitans' existence, necessitated the construction of a new arena. The Civic Ice Arena was completed in 1928, and with it came the return of professional hockey to Seattle after this four-year hiatus. A Seattle team entered as a founding member of each iteration of the Pacific Coast Hockey League.\nSeattle Eskimos (1928–1931).\nThe Seattle Eskimos were a professional ice hockey team based in Seattle from 1928 to 1931. Founded by former Seattle Metropolitans manager Pete Muldoon, the team was a founding member of the first iteration of the PCHL, and played in the Civic Ice Arena.\nThe team wore the barberpole green, red, and white jerseys of the Metropolitans with a modified S wordmark crest.\nSeattle Sea Hawks (1933–1941).\nFollowing the demise of the first iteration of the PCHL, the Seattle Sea Hawks began as a founding member of the North West Hockey League. The team played in the NWHL during that league's three season existence \nSeattle Stars (1944–1945).\nThe Seattle Stars, also known as Sick's Stars, were a minor professional hockey team based at Seattle's Civic Ice Arena who played during the final iteration of the PCHL's inaugural 1944–45 season. The team was owned by Emil Sick, owner of Rainier Beer and the Seattle Rainiers baseball team.\nIn their single season, the team was coached by Roger Jenkins, who had coached the previous season for the cross-town rival Seattle Isaacson Iron Workers. The team won 12 games, lost 14, and tied 1 for a third-place finish in the PCHL's North division, before losing to the Portland Eagles in the first round of the playoffs.\nSeattle Totems (1944–1975).\nProfessional hockey returned to Seattle in the post-war era in the form of two new teams playing in the final iteration of the PCHL. One team (the Stars) folded after one season, leaving the other (the Ironmen) to survive and become the Seattle Totems. Known u\nFailed attempts to acquire an NHL team (1974–2017).\nOn June 12, 1974, the NHL announced new expansion teams in Denver and Seattle that would start play in the 1976–77 season. Vince Abbey led the Seattle group. The Seattle team, which according to season ticket promotions would have kept the WHL name of Totems, never played a game. The NHL rescinded the expansion offer later in 1974 after Abbey missed deadlines to pay a deposit and a franchise fee. Abbey and Eldred Barnes filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NHL, seeking $30 million in damages. In December 1983, a judge dismissed the suit while the trial was in progress and ordered the plaintiffs to pay the Vancouver Canucks US$600,000 in damages on a counterclaim.\nIn June 1975, Abbey tried to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins with the intention to move the team to Seattle when they were sold in a bankruptcy auction for US$4.4 million.\nAnother local group attempted to bring an NHL expansion team to Seattle in 1990, but the deal failed due to the financial terms that the NHL demanded. Then-Seattle SuperSonics owner Barry Ackerley committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990, deadline as part of a proposed new arena deal, provided that a group could be found willing to meet the NHL's asking price of $50 million. His son Bill, president of the Ackerley Group, worked with Bill Lear of the First National Bank of Chicago, in order to find an ownership group for the prospective franchise. The only group to step forward was led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player and coach Bill MacFarland. Ackerley and the Larson–MacFarland group met multiple times, but the Larson–MacFarland group determined that the expansion franchise was worth $15 million less than what the NHL was asking for.\nAckerley rescinded Seattle's bid without Larson's or MacFarland's knowledge. Larson and MacFarland told the Seattle media that the Ackerley Group cost Seattle a chance at an NHL team. Ackerley responded that Seattle lost its chance because Larson and MacFarland were unwilling to accept the NHL's expansion terms. Among the unfavorable terms were very high season ticket requirements; a 20-year arena lease with a \"substantial\" share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured US$5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team. The NHL, unable to come to an agreement with any owners in Seattle, instead sold two new franchises to groups in Ottawa and Tampa Bay.\nLater talks about an NHL team for Seattle were derailed due to renovations to KeyArena. Prior to renovations in 1994 and 1995, the arena had an ice hockey configuration that had been used by the WHL Totems. After the renovations, which optimized the arena for the Seattle SuperSonics, the arena's scoreboard and seats were not positioned well for hockey games. This was a major factor in the major junior Seattle Thunderbirds leaving for the ShoWare Center in Kent in 2009. In 2012, League deputy commissioner Bill Daly stated that KeyArena would be \"a difficult arena for hockey\" due to the large number of obstructed-view seats. All NHL exhibition games held in Seattle after the renovation were instead hosted at the Tacoma Dome 30 miles south of Seattle.\nExpansion and relocation proposals often came with a new arena proposal, especially after the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008. Several investors considered Seattle as a locale for expansion or relocation on condition that a suitable arena could be built. In 2011, Don Levin, owner of the Chicago Wolves, had expressed interest in building a new arena in nearby Bellevue that could host an NHL team. On February 16, 2012, a plan was announced to build a new arena in Seattle's SoDo district, just south of Safeco Field. An investment group led by hedge fund manager Chris Hansen proposed the arena, seeking to host a returned SuperSonics franchise and possibly an NHL team as well.\nWhen Greg Jamison was unable to meet a deadline to purchase the Phoenix Coyotes on January 31, 2013, speculation began that the team would be relocated to Seattle. On June 16, 2013, it was confirmed that the Phoenix Coyotes would be moving to Seattle if an arena deal between the team and the City of Glendale was not reached. Ray Bartozek and Anthony Lanza intended to purchase the franchise for US$220 million and would have begun operations in Seattle for the following season. The relocation plan ended after July 3, 2013, when the Glendale City Council voted 4–3 to keep the Phoenix Coyotes in Glendale.\nA 2013 study by Nate Silver concluded that Seattle had the largest number of avid ice hockey fans of any U.S. media market that did not have an NHL team.\nSeattle Kraken (2018–present).\nSuccessful expansion bid (2018–2021).\nOn December 4, 2017, the Seattle City Council voted 7–1 to approve a memorandum of understanding between the city of Seattle and the Los Angeles-based Oak View Group, co-founded by Tim Leiweke, for renovations of KeyArena. Renovations for the arena began in 2018 and were completed in 2021. The arena was renamed Climate Pledge Arena after a new naming rights deal was signed with Amazon.com. The original roof remains in place, as it is considered a landmark. The rest of the building saw a complete renovation with land being dug down and out. While the renovations were intended for acquiring an NHL franchise, acquiring a new SuperSonics basketball team was also within the design of the approval. On December 7, the NHL's board of governors agreed to consider an expansion application from Seattle, with an expansion fee set at US$650 million. The Seattle ownership group was represented by David Bonderman and Jerry Bruckheimer, who conducted a preliminary season ticket drive to gauge interest in Seattle.\nOn February 13, 2018, the Oak View Group filed an application with the NHL for an expansion team and paid a US$10 million application fee. At the time, the earliest a Seattle NHL expansion team could have begun playing was the 2020–21 season pending the completion of arena renovations.\nOn March 1, 2018, a ticket drive began to gauge interests in season ticket deposits. Oak View reported that their initial goal of 10,000 deposits was surpassed in 12 minutes, and that they received 25,000 deposits in 75 minutes. On April 11, 2018, Tod Leiweke was named CEO of Seattle's NHL expansion team. On June 18, 2018, Dave Tippett was named as a senior advisor. Another step towards an expansion team was taken on October 2, 2018, when the NHL Executive Committee unanimously agreed to recommend the expansion bid to a vote of the Board of Governors in December.\nThe NHL Board of Governors voted unanimously to approve Seattle's expansion team on December 4, 2018. The Seattle Kraken played their first season in 2021–22 as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference, consequently shifting the Arizona Coyotes from the Pacific Division to the Central Division to balance out the four divisions at eight teams each. In May 2019, the team launched an interactive \"fan portal\" where fans could propose a name and uniform colors for the team, answer poll questions, get information about ticket pricing and seating, and view a timeline of past and future key events involving the club.\nOn July 23, 2020, the franchise announced their team name, the Seattle Kraken, as well as their team colors, branding, and home jersey. The event was held under the banner of \"Release the Kraken\", a phrase popularized by the 1981 film \"Clash of the Titans\" and the 2010 remake. \"Kraken\" was a name that was already popular with fans prior to its official adoption. The franchise's promotional materials state that it was adopted to honor the maritime culture of Seattle, as well as in reference to the giant Pacific octopus, the largest species of octopus in the world, which can be found in the waters of the Pacific Northwest.\nOn April 30, 2021, the franchise paid the final installment of the $650 million expansion fee, officially making the Seattle Kraken the 32nd team of the NHL.\nAn expansion draft for the Kraken was held on July 21, 2021, in a similar manner to a previous expansion draft held in 2017 for the Vegas Golden Knights, who were exempt from it.\nThe NHL awarded Seattle and T-Mobile Park the January 1, 2024 Winter Classic with the Kraken hosting the Vegas Golden Knights in a holiday matinee game on TNT.\nJunior hockey (1977–present).\nIn the Puget Sound region, two teams participate in the Canadian major junior leagues: the Seattle Thunderbirds, based south of Seattle in Kent, and Everett Silvertips, north of Seattle in Everett. Both play in the U.S. Division of the Western Conference of the Western Hockey League (WHL). From 1991 to 1995, the WHL also included a team from Tacoma, the Tacoma Rockets.\nThe Seattle Jr. Totems compete in the United States Premier Hockey League and play their home games at Olympic View Arena in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, north of Seattle.\nProfessional minor-league teams in Tacoma (1930–2002).\nThe city of Tacoma has hosted three now-defunct professional minor-league hockey franchises.\nTacoma Tigers (1930–1931).\nThe Tacoma Tigers were Tacoma's first entry into professional hockey, and played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League for part of the 1930–31 season. The Tigers were founded in 1928 in Victoria, British Columbia as the Victoria Cubs, whose arena burnt down on November 10, 1929, following the 1928–29 season. The Cubs spent the 1929–30 season as a traveling team before being purchased by H.A. Briggs with the intention of relocation to Tacoma.\nThe team's stint representing Tacoma was a short one, as the team only played ten away games of their expected 35 game schedule before folding. The Tigers scored 12 goals and conceded 24 over the course of their two wins, seven loss, and one tie, two games of which were a double-header of shortened two-period games in Vancouver. The team was coached by Mickey MacKay.\nDespite a deadline extension from the league, the Tigers were unable to procure funding for the planned construction of their new hockey arena in Tacoma, and thus were disbanded on January 1, 1931.\nTacoma Rockets (1946–1953).\nThe longest-lasting professional team to play in the city were the original Tacoma Rockets."

        "text": "Archie Marshall (born April 17, 1965) is an American former basketball player, known for his college career with the Kansas Jayhawks, where he was a member of their 1988 national championship team.\nA small forward from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Marshall was a standout at Edison Preparatory School, earning state player of the year honors from the Oklahoma Coaches Association as a senior. He signed with Seminole State College in Seminole, Oklahoma, joining fellow Tulsan Anthony Bowie on coach Jim Kerwin's last team. Marshall averaged 16.7 points per game for the Trojans in the 1983–84 season. Following his sole junior college season, Marshall left the school and enrolled at the University of Kansas, ultimately committing to play basketball for the Jayhawks.\nMarshall made his Jayhawk debut in the 1985–86 season, becoming a key rotation player for the team and averaging 7 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. The team went 35–4 on the season, winning both the Big Eight Conference regular season and tournament titles. The team ultimately advanced to the Final Four of the 1986 NCAA tournament. In the Jayhawks' semifinal game against Duke, Marshall tore his left Anterior cruciate ligament on a breakaway layup. The injury was severe and caused Marshall to sit out the 1986–87 season as he healed from the surgery to repair the knee.\nAfter his season off to rehab, Marshall rejoined the Jayhawks for the 1987–88 season. He entered the starting lineup and led the Jayhawks to an 8–2 start before injuring his right knee in a December game against St. John's, effectively ending his season. The team struggled with the loss of one of their best players, ultimately losing 5 out of 6 games in an early 1988 stretch. Marshall's season was over until coach Larry Brown surprised the crowd by inserting Marshall at the end of the team's last regular season game to get a last college appearance. Marshall took and missed a 40-foot jump shot while still encumbered by a leg brace and with very limited mobility. The new look Jayhawks adapted to Marshall's absence and ultimately went on a run behind All-American Danny Manning to win the 1988 national championship. Marshall served as motivation and inspiration for the team, with Manning writing Marshall's number 23 on his wristbands and the team dedicating its run to their injured teammate.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Marshall was drafted by Brown, now head coach of the San Antonio Spurs, with the last pick (third round, 75th pick overall) of the 1988 NBA draft. However, he did not play in the National Basketball Association. He played a season in Australia in 1990 for Wangaratta of the Big V."

        "text": "The 1929–30 Penn Quakers men's ice hockey season was the 14th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPenn began the season under the leadership of NHL alumnus Herb Gardiner but he turned control of the team over to William Farson after the first game. The initial match against the Penn Athletic Club, a collection of former college players, happened early in the season and did so while the team was missing a pair of starters. The loss of Strain in goal was catastrophic; the team was hammered 10–4 with little coming from the game other than knowing that they needed improved play in net.\nWhile coach Farson tried to address the problem in goal with the addition of Klein to the team, he added Quaker football player Greene to the defense, hoping that he would shore up the early deficiencies. The second game was played against St. John's just before the winter break with Woods shifted to forward in place of LaGhost and, though the team did show a great deal of improvement, they were able to eek out a 6–5 victory in overtime.\nAfter returning from the break, the team went through a series of intensive practices to get them ready for the match against Amherst, which had been added to the schedule just prior to the St. John's game. The defense turned in a much better effort, limiting their opponents to just 3 goals but the team fell to purple team 2–3. Rough play characterized the next game a week later and several penalties led to Penn surrendering their early advantage.\nThe team had a quick turnaround for their next match and welcomed one of the strongest teams in the country on the 21st. Clarkson proved too much for the Quakers to handle and dispatched Penn 0–12. Penn's losing streak continued through a match with Colgate and the team entered the semester break with little to show for their efforts.\nThe first game after the break resulted in another loss for the Quakers. Penn began slow, with only Klein's play keeping them in the match. The team surged in the final 20 minutes, however, and tried to overcome Williams lead, ultimately failing to surpass the Ephs. The team then played their lone road game of the season the following week, losing to Brown to extend their streak to six games.\nPenn finally won another game when they met Villanova near the end of February. The two teams entered the third period tied at 1-all but the Quakers' offense exploded for 6 goals in the final frame, doing so in front of approximately 1,000 spectators. The team headed into their final pair of games for the season without their captain as O'Reilly was out with an illness. In spite of his absence, the Quakers defeated the visiting Dutchmen and did so in convincing fashion. The team continued the inspired play with a second consecutive shutout, downing RPI 2–0 and ending on a high note.\nThe moderate success of the team and the support from the student body led most to believe the program would return the following year, however, the realities of the Great Depression eventually took their toll. The expensive program was suspended before the next season began. The team returned in an unofficial capacity at the beginning of the next decade but World War II prevented anything from formally occurring until the mid-60's.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

In 1904, he joined a syndicate headed by \"Washington Star\" owner Thomas C. Noyes that bought the Senators from Fred Postal. When Noyes died late in the season, the board named Minor as his successor.\nMinor immediately came into conflict with manager Clark Griffith; he was not as inclined to give Griffith as free a hand in baseball matters as Noyes had been. Minor and the other owners were not willing to let Griffith spend money to improve the team on the field. The Senators had risen to second in Griffith's first year as manager, but hadn't been able to sustain that pace. By 1919, however, Minor felt he could no longer devote attention to the Senators, and sold his stake to Griffith and Philadelphia grain magnate William Richardson in late 1919. Richardson allowed Griffith to vote his shares as well, effectively giving Griffith controlling interest.\nMinor served as receiver for \"The Washington Post\" in 1933.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a pitcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) before the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). The pitcher is the player who pitches the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, playing the most difficult and specialized position, and as such is regarded as being at the right end of the defensive spectrum. Pitchers play far less than players at other positions, generally appearing in only two or three games per week; only one pitcher in major league history has appeared in 100 games in a single season. There are many different types of pitchers, generally divided between starting pitchers and relief pitchers, which include the middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1.\nPitchers are most commonly credited with an assist when they field a ground ball batted back toward the mound and throw the ball either to the first baseman to retire the batter/runner, or to another infielder to force out a runner, perhaps beginning a double play; of special importance are throws to the catcher if a runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run. Pitchers also earn assists on pickoff throws, by throwing to a base after catching a line drive in order to retire a runner before they can tag up, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a ground ball before another defensive player successfully fields the ball. Pitchers generally record fewer assists than infielders or catchers due to the quick reaction time needed to field the ball after it is hit, as the pitcher is the closest player in front of the batter.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, assist totals for pitchers have likewise declined, and only one of the top 20 career leaders has been active since 1934; only five of the top 66 have been active since 1965. None of the top 87 single-season totals were recorded after 1918, and none of the top 477 have been recorded since 1944. Cy Young is the all-time leader in career assists as a pitcher with 2,014, over 500 more than any other pitcher. Zack Greinke, who had 485 assists through the 2023 season to place him 239th all-time, is the leader among active players."

In his sophomore season, Anderson shared the starting role with Mike Richter, a future NHLer, and was relegated to backup duties as a junior. Richter left after 1987 to pursue a professional career, leaving Anderson a chance to reclaim the primary job. Anderson was tremendous in his final season, setting a program record with 30 wins and being named an All-American. Anderson led the team to the WCHA Championship and was named Tournament MVP, the first time the award was ever given. Wisconsin won their first round match in the NCAA Tournament but fell in the quarterfinal round.\nBecause of his spectacular renaissance, Anderson was selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1988 Supplemental Draft and joined the team's farm system the following year. Anderson didn't have much success in 1989, allowing more than 6 goals per game in what few appearances he was allowed. He showed a marked improvement the following year, but it was in 1991 when it appeared he had caught on to the professional game. Anderson led the Knoxville Cherokees to a regular season ECHL title, boasting the best save percentage in the league. He was named a First-Team All-Star and even got a brief recall to the Newmarket Saints. Unfortunately, Anderson had a terrible season in 1992, seeing his goals against average balloon to more than five and a half goal per game. He retired after the season."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Pakistan in 2021–22",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured Pakistan in March and April 2022 to play three Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Twenty20 International (T20I) match. The Test series formed part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship, and the ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. It was Australia's first tour to Pakistan since 1998. The Test series was the first time that the teams played for the Benaud–Qadir Trophy, named after former international cricketers Richie Benaud and Abdul Qadir.\nThe first Test ended in a draw, with the teams shaking hands before the scheduled close of play on day five. Across the match, Pakistan's aggregate score was 728 for 4, with Australia's Steve Smith saying that the wicket was \"dead\" and benign\". The pitch was later rated as \"below average\" by match referee Ranjan Madugalle. The second Test also finished in a draw on the fifth day, after Australia had declared on 556/9 in their first innings, with Pakistan's Babar Azam scoring 196 runs in the fourth innings. Australia won the third Test by 115 runs in the final session of play on day five to win the series 1–0. It was Australia's first Test series win in Asia since 2011, and their first Test win in Asia since 2017.\nAustralia won the opening ODI match by 88 runs, after Travis Head scored a century. In the second match, Australia scored 348/8 from their 50 overs, with Ben McDermott scoring his first ODI century. In reply, Pakistan made 349/4 in 49 overs, with centuries from Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam, to record Pakistan's highest successful run chase in an ODI match. Pakistan won the third ODI by nine wickets to take the series 2–1, with Babar Azam scoring another century. It was Pakistan's first ODI series win against Australia since June 2002. Australia finished the tour by winning the one-off T20I match by three wickets.\nThe tour was deemed a success with former players from both teams praising the teams and requesting for more international cricket in Pakistan. Pakistan's Shahid Afridi said that \"I hope other teams will follow their footsteps &amp; visit Pakistan\", with Shoaib Akhtar also saying that he was \"glad the whole series with Australia went smooth\". Australia's Shane Watson also said that the tour was \"great thing for world cricket\".\nBackground.\nIn September 2021, Cricket Australia said they were monitoring the situation in Pakistan and will \"talk with the relevant authorities once more information becomes known\", after New Zealand cancelled their tour of Pakistan due to a security threat. In November 2021, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed the fixtures for the tour. On 4 February 2022, the PCB made some minor changes to the tour schedule. The limited overs matches were moved from Lahore to Rawalpindi, and the venues of the first two Test matches were swapped around, with Cricket Australia endorsing the tour.\nAfter initial fears that some Australian players may opt out of the tour, Australia named a full-strength Test squad on 8 February 2022. Originally, the Test matches would have overlapped with Australia's T20I tour of New Zealand. However, on 9 February 2022, that tour was abandoned after there were no managed isolation quarantine (MIQ) spots available for the Australian team. On 27 February 2022, the Australian team arrived in Pakistan, landing at Islamabad International Airport.\nOn 18 March 2022, the limited overs matches were moved from Rawalpindi to Lahore, due to political tension in Islamabad.\nSquads.\nPakistan also named Kamran Ghulam, Mohammad Abbas, Naseem Shah, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Yasir Shah as reserve players for the Test series. Prior to the start of the Test series, Mohammad Nawaz was ruled out of Pakistan's squad with a foot injury. Mohammad Haris was also added to Pakistan's reserve list for the Test matches. Hasan Ali and Faheem Ashraf were both ruled out of Pakistan's squad for the first Test due to injuries, with Iftikhar Ahmed and Mohammad Wasim added to their squad. On 1 March 2022, Haris Rauf tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, travelling reserve Naseem Shah was added to Pakistan's squad for the first Test. Faheem Ashraf, who was ruled out of the first Test due to an injury, was also initially ruled out of the second Test after testing positive for COVID-19. However, less than 24 hours later, Faheem was given the go-ahead to join Pakistan's Test squad after clearing a rapid antigen test. On 20 March 2022, Zahid Mahmood replaced Mohammad Nawaz in Pakistan's ODI and T20I squads after not recovering from his foot injury. Zahid was also named as cover for Shadab Khan.\nAhead of the tour, Michael Neser was ruled out of the series and was replaced by Mark Steketee in the Australian Test team. Australia also named Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett as standby players for the tour. Kane Richardson was ruled out of Australia's ODI and T20I squads due to a hamstring injury. Ben Dwarshuis was named as his replacement. Steve Smith was also ruled out of Australia's limited overs matches, due to an elbow problem, and was replaced by Mitchell Swepson. Mitchell Marsh was ruled out of Australia's squad for the first ODI due to a hip injury, before being ruled out of all of the white-ball matches. Ashton Agar was ruled out of Australia's squad for the ODI matches after testing positive for COVID-19 with Matt Renshaw named as his replacement.\nIn popular culture.\nThe second season of the Australian docu-series - The Test was produced, following the Australian national cricket team in the aftermath of the resignation of Tim Paine as Test captain. The third episode of Season 2 featured Australia playing the three tests against England."

        "text": "Cycling infrastructure in the Canadian city of Halifax, Nova Scotia includes most regular streets and roads, bike lanes, protected cycle tracks, local street bikeways, and multi-use pathways.\nIn recent years, the municipal government has been developing an \"all ages and abilities bikeway network\" (commonly called the \"AAA network\") in the urban core with the aim of increasing the proportion of trips that are made by bicycle.\nDevelopment.\nHistory.\nEarly bike lanes in Halifax include those on Bell Road, Brunswick Street, and South Park Street. The 1999 addition of a third lane to the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge also included the construction of a dedicated bikeway crossing Halifax Harbour.\nThe city's first bicycle plan, \"Blueprint for a Bicycle Friendly HRM\", was approved by council in 2002. It was superseded in 2006 by the \"Active Transportation Plan\", which was updated in 2014 (see below).\n\"AAA\" bikeway network.\nIn 2014, the Halifax council approved the \"Making Connections: 2014-19 Halifax Active Transportation Priorities Plan\". The plan was developed with extensive public participation. Among respondents, the most popular concept mentioned was the construction of a bicycle network in the regional centre (defined as the Halifax peninsula and the area of Dartmouth within the Circumferential Highway). The plan identified several goals including developing a connected bicycle network, doubling the modal share of bicycles by 2026, and improving bicycle infrastructure by introducing new types of facilities such as protected bike lanes.\nA 2016 survey found significant interest among Halifax residents in cycling more often, but respondents wished for greater separation from motor traffic. The city aims to capture this \"latent demand\" by improving cycling infrastructure and increasing the share of trips made by bicycle.\nOverall transportation improvements in Halifax are guided by the Integrated Mobility Plan (IMP), which was approved by council in December 2017. As part of the IMP, the city is currently building an \"all ages and abilities bikeway network\" in the regional centre, commonly called the \"AAA network\". \n\"All ages and ability\" bicycle infrastructure is defined as facilities that are \"comfortable for a wide range of cycling abilities and experience levels\". Guidance on the design of this type of infrastructure is provided by organisations such as the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) and the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC).\nThe AAA network comprises around of routes intended to form a comprehensive cycling network in the regional centre. About of the routes already met \"AAA\" standard, such as the Macdonald Bridge bikeway. In addition to new cycling infrastructure, the project will include the upgrading of some existing routes. For example, conventional bike lanes on Hollis, Lower Water, and South Park streets are being upgraded to protected bikeways.\nIn July 2019, the project received $25 million in funding from all three levels of government. It was expected to be completed by 2022. However, as of 2022 it was only around 40 per cent complete.\nTypes of cycling routes in Halifax.\nBike lanes.\nBike lanes are painted lanes designated for use by cyclists. In Halifax, these typically do not offer physical protection to cyclists. They are not considered \"all ages and abilities\" bicycle infrastructure.\nCyclist advocates have criticized the fact that conventional Halifax bike lanes tend to end before reaching intersections.\nProtected bikeways.\nThe first protected bike lane in Halifax opened as a pilot project on Rainnie Drive in 2015, as part of the redesign of the intersection at North Park Street and Cogswell Street. At that time, most of Rainnie Drive was converted to serve one-way car traffic only. The two-way bikeway is separated from the carriageway by a painted buffer and plastic bollards.\nSome existing bike lanes are being upgraded to become protected bikeways. The bike lanes on South Park Street between Inglis Street and Spring Garden Road were upgraded in 2019, with plans made to extend the bikeways to Sackville Street in 2020. In 2020, the bike lanes on Hollis Street and Lower Water Street were similarly being upgraded.\nLocal street bikeways.\nLocal street bikeways were introduced as part of the AAA bikeway network. These are quieter, local streets considered strategic links in the cycling network. In designating a local street bikeway, various design and regulatory changes are made to improve safety and comfort for cyclists. These include:\nThe region's first local street bikeway was constructed on Vernon and Seymour streets, connecting the Quinpool District to Dalhousie University, and linking planned segregated cycling facilities on Windsor Street and University Avenue. Various streetscape changes were made, including the addition of traffic calming measures, curb extensions at intersections, and a bicycle lane at the Quinpool Road intersection. New pedestrian/bicyclist-actuated traffic signals were also installed at the Vernon-Seymour-Coburg intersection. The first phase of this bikeway opened in 2019.\nMulti-use pathways.\nMulti-use pathways are routes shared by cyclists and pedestrians, separated from car traffic.\nOrganisations and culture.\nHalifax has several non-profit organisations that promote cycling in the city, including the Halifax Cycling Coalition, Bike Again (a DIY bike shop), and the Ecology Action Centre.\nCritical Mass events have been held regularly for many years. One such ride, held to highlight the need for safety improvements after a cyclist was struck by a motorist and seriously injured on Purcells Cove Road, attracted several hundred cyclists in July 2022. Kidical Mass rides are also held regularly to promote safe and independent mobility for children.\nThe city also has a \"Bicycle Mayor\", an unofficial advocate for cycling culture. The international bicycle mayor network is coordinated by BYCS, an Amsterdam-based social organisation. Halifax's first bicycle mayor, Jillian Banfield, served from 2019 to 2023. The incumbent bicycle mayor is Stephen MacKay, who took over the position in May 2023."

        "text": "Rev. William Milne (27 July 1883 – 16 December 1982) was a Scotland international rugby union player. After playing rugby, he became a minister in the Church of Scotland.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Glasgow Academicals.\nHe was part of the Academicals side that won the Scottish Unofficial Championship in 1904-05 and 1905-06 seasons.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Glasgow District in the 1904 inter-city match against Edinburgh District.\nHe played for Cities District in the January 1905 match against Provinces District.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped for Scotland 4 times in the period 1904 to 1905.\nEcclesiastical career.\nMilne became a Reverend in the Church of Scotland. He was a Minister of the parish of Crail in the presbytery of St. Andrews in Fife.\nDuring the First World War, Milne became a driver for the Red Cross in France. His parish was temporarily administered by Rev. D. W. Kennedy of Perth. Milne wrote letters back to his congregation, one of which was reported in the \"East Fife Record\" newspaper of 26 October 1916, the letter from Milne dated before that.\nRouen, 15th Oct., 1916. MY DEAR FRIENDS, By the time this reaches you three months will have passed since I left Crail. In the usual reckoning it is not a long time, but looking back there seems quite a gap between my wonted life and the life I am living at the present and the work on which lam engaged. Yet though the days are full of new interest and new duties, no day is so full but thoughts of the old duties and interests and friends can find a place in it. I look forward eagerly for news of Crail and from Crail, and a letter or a newspaper from the East Neuk sends my thoughts across the sundering miles to you and the place where you dwell. There is no need at this time — nor indeed would it be possible — that I should tell you fully of the work here. In a general way I may say that it is driving the wounded in motor ambulances to one or other of the hospitals in or around Rouen. The unloading of the trains of wounded is a sad enough sight, and one that does not lose its pathos even with repetition. It is a sight that all should see who speak lightly of war or emphasise the glamour and glitter of it, for the romantic side of things is conspicuous by its absence. Yet there are fine things even in these processions of bruised and battered humanity wounded men badly in need of help themselves, yet helping some lame comrade; men enduring in grim silence an agony of suffering; cheerful souls speaking hopefully of the future though they have lost a limb or an eye, and \"must enter into life maimed\" after the war. One is impressed with the fact that a short time here brings about a readjustment of moral values, that some things which at home seem of great importance shrink to insignificance, and other virtues which had slipped into the background loom large and vital here. I have seen nothing to justify the talk of those who speak of our soldier saints. There is much that is sinful and revolting, but much, too, that is unselfish and great. A pleasanter bit of work is driving the wounded to the hospital ship or the train conveying them to the port of embarkation for home, or \"Blighty' as they always call it. The men are very happy to go home, and I have never met one who wanted to come back to France. Homesickness is a disease that is very prevalent, and naturally since no man wishes to be away from those he loves best. We miss our quiet Scottish Sabbath and the House of God. War knows nothing of Sabbaths or Churches, and the most we can have to distinguish Sundays from week days is a short service conducted by a neighbouring chaplain. It is on the Sabbath especially that my thoughts turn to the ancient Kirk of Crail and its pleasant surroundings. I am glad to hear that all is going well, and that the faithful services of Mr Kennedy are so much appreciated. I hope that every member and adherent will remember the responsibilities as well as the privileges of church membership, and will endeavour to make his or her contribution to the life and worship of the Church. It is the beginning of the winter's work, and my sincere prayer is that the work may be rich in the spirit of kindness and gentleness and sincerity, that it may be a blessing to all who take part in it, and fruitful of good things. You wiH have disadvantages and hindrances owing to the lighting restrictions and the unavoidable reduction of numbers because of the demands of war, but I trust that enthusiasm will more than counterbalance these. Assuring you of my continued interest in your welfare, I remain, Your minister and friend, Ww. M. MILNE.\nFamily.\nHe was born to George Milne and Barbara Murray.\nHe married Kathleen Florence May Lumsden in 1919.\nWilliam Milne and Kathleen Lumsden had a son, also William Murray Milne (1920-1977)."

In 1901, he had to give evidence to an inquest on the case of a Mrs Mills of Streetley who committed suicide. Evans was the doctor called. The \"Reading Mercury\" of 27 July 1901 reported:\nDr. Herbert Lavington Evans said he had not attended deceased just lately, she had been staying with a relative at Worthing, but he attended her before she went away. She was depressed and suffering from nervous indigestion, but this was not apparently of a serious nature. He was sent for about 11 o'clock on Sunday morning, and when he arrived he found deceased seated in chair, described, with her head inclined to the left, and razor was lying in her right hand. There was a large wound on the left side of the neck in front. She was quite dead. Her hand was marked by the handle of the razor; evidently two cuts had been made with great force, and he had no doubt it was done by her own hand. A verdict that \"Deceased died from her throat being cut with razor whilst in unsound state of mind\", was returned.\nHe was called to another inquest in 1913 when the Countess of Cottenham died of a gunshot wound, thought to been inflicted when she slipped while carrying her gun. The \"Banbury Guardian\" of 8 May 1913 reporting:\nDr. Herbert Lavington Evans, Goring, said be found that the charge from the gun had entered the body under the left breast and had passed out at the left side of the back. The appearance the wound indicated tliat the gun was discharged at close quarters. The wound was in itself ample cause death. He did not think the charge touched the heart. He could not give any idea as how long Lady Tottenham had been dead. There was on his arrival slight stiffening of the body. As far he could judge should think death had taken place over an hour before saw* the body, as it had cooled considerably. The left ribs had been pierced the charge, and it had made its way out the fifth rib just above the loin. Judging the large amount of blood which was lost he should imagine that death was very speedy. He formed the opinion, from the marks which he saw at the spot, that probably Lady Cottenham, after being shot, had rolled down the hill few feet, and that she had sufficient strength left to prop herself against the tree against which the body was resting. There was a discoloration the clothes, and some blackening around the wound. The muzzle of the gun was probably within a few inches of the body at the time the shot was fired. The wound was extremely small at the opening; that clearly proved that the gun must have been very close to the body when it was fired.\nFamily.\nHe was born to David Parker Evans (1816-1880) and Susan Mary Nicholson (1825-1920) in Clifton, Gloucestershire.\nHe married Maud Trimmer in 1885.\nThey had 3 children:- Violet Muriel Evans, Norman Duthie Evans and Aileen Marion Evans."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a left fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). The left fielder (LF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Left field is the area of the outfield to the left of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders have to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The left fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of left field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder closest to third base, the left fielder generally does not have to throw as far as the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often do not have the strongest throwing arm, but their throws need to be accurate. The left fielder normally plays behind the third baseman and shortstop, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, left fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the left fielder is assigned the number 7.\nLeft fielders are most commonly credited with an assist when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Left fielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Left fielders also earn assists on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch. Outfielders record far fewer assists than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more assists in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Assists are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication about an outfielder's throwing arm than assists by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 1890s through 1920s, including the dead-ball era, due to that period's emphasis on more aggressive baserunning. Only four of the top 14 players were active after 1932, only two of them after 1945. Only two of the top 34 single-season totals were recorded after 1924, and only one after 1936; only seven of the top 68 have been recorded since 1944. Because game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate assist totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Jimmy Sheckard is the all-time leader in career assists as a left fielder with 243; this total does not included his assists during the first four years of his career from 1897 through 1900, when he is believed to have played 168 games in left field. Zack Wheat (231) and Duffy Lewis (209) are the only other players credited with more than 200 career assists after 1900. Michael Brantley, who had 55 assists through the 2023 season to place him tied for 108th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "text": "Philip Berger (born December 3, 1966) is an American former professional ice hockey right wing and coach who was an All-American for Northern Michigan and a member of the ECHL Hall of Fame.\nCareer.\nBerger began playing for the Northern Michigan Wildcats in 1985 but found it difficult to get into games. In his first two seasons, Berger played in only about half of NMU's contests but did show some improvement as a sophomore. In his junior season, Berger finally played most of the games and his scoring production skyrocketed. He nearly quadrupled his career scoring totals and finished in the top 10 in the nation. He was named an All-American and scored almost a quarter of Northern Michigan's goals for the season. Unfortunately, the wildcats weren't very good and knocked out in the conference quarterfinals. Berger's late blooming caused the Quebec Nordiques to take a flyer on him with the 3rd selection in the 1988 Supplemental Draft.\nThough Berger's offensive numbers dipped in his senior season, he was again top-10 in the country and led the Wildcats to a renaissance. The Wildcats finished second in the WCHA and won their first WCHA Championship. Northern Michigan returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 8 years but were knocked out of the first round 1–2.\nThe following season, Berger began his professional career in the IHL but soon found himself demoted to the ECHL. He soon grew accustomed to the league and led the Greensboro Monarchs in scoring despite missing 14 games. He led the team on a run through the playoffs with 11 goals, 6 more than the next highest Monarch, and captured the Riley Cup as league champions. Berger got a brief promotion to the AHL the following year but spent the bulk of the year back in Greensboro. His scoring dropped for the regular season but his playoff performance was even more impressive, finishing 3rd overall despite Greensboro losing the championship.\nIn 1992, Berger Put together a spectacular season, averaging a goal per game as he played the entire year in Greensboro and led the league in scoring. He was named the ECHL MVP and led the Monarchs to the East Conference Championship. He was a force in the postseason again, leading his team in goals, assists and points, but Greensboro fell in the conference finals. He finished out the year with the Fort Wayne Komets, adding 6 points in 4 IHL postseason games. The massive amount of scoring he had done in 1992 led Berger receiving a promotion to the IHL in 1993 but, despite producing 7 points in 8 games, he eventually found himself back with the Monarchs. Even though he missed almost a third of the team's games he still finished second in scoring for Greensboro.\nBerger had another monster season in 1994, leading the ECHL in scoring even with a brief callup to the AHL. The next season he split between Greenboro, Detroit and Schalker but a knee injury limited his effectiveness during the season. He returned in force for the postseason, again pacing the Monarchs as they marched to the Finals. In 1996, Berger briefly halted his playing career to take over as the head coach for the West Palm Beach Barracudas. He did so in part to give his knee a chance to recover and because the Barracudas' regular head coach, Bill Nyrop, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He surrendered the reigns midseason and returned to the ECHL, however, because the Monarchs franchise had been promoted to the AHL, Berger joined the Charlotte Checkers. He played well at the end of the regular season but, as was his want, he turned up his scoring in the playoffs. He led all players with 10 goals and 27 points, helping the Checkers run through the postseason without a loss and capture the Riley Trophy. \nThe following year, Berger ended up playing for five different teams in three different leagues, ending up on the El Paso Buzzards. He won the inaugural WPHL championship, again as a major contributor in the playoffs, and retired after the season. Berger returned two years later when the ECHL returned to Greensboro in the form of the Generals. He lasted just 5 scoreless games before retiring for good as the league's all-time leading scorer in the postseason. He was inducted into the ECHL Hall of Fame in 2011."

In spite of this, she qualified for West Babylon High School's varsity lacrosse team as a seventh-grader. As a sophomore, Smith set a new state record with 129 goals and 67 assists during the 2006 season.\nDuring her senior year, Smith recorded 13 goals in one game, ranking second behind Shari Maslin of Clarkstown North for the highest single-game total in state history. She finished her senior year with 93 goals and 23 assists, becoming the only player in state history to reach 500 goals. Throughout her school career, she was a six-time letter-winner and set New York state records for goals and points in lacrosse. Smith was also a member of the 2005 NYS National School Girls Team and United States' Under 19 team which competed at the 2007 World Championships.\nCareer.\nCollegiate.\nUpon graduating high school, Smith enrolled at Northwestern University and competed with the Northwestern Wildcats women's lacrosse team with a Division I scholarship. As a freshman, she started in all 23 games for the Wildcats and ranked fifth on the team with 33 goals. At the conclusion of the year, she was named to the Womenslacrosse.com All-Rookie Team and was invited to the United States Women's Lacrosse Developmental Team.\nThe following year, Smith recorded 69 goals and 102 points on the year, both of which were the seventh-highest single-season totals in program history. As a result, she earned a first-team IWLCA All-American selection and All-America selection by both WomensLax.com and WomensLacrosse.com. In her junior year, Smith scored 78 goals and 41 assists to lead Division I in total points, points per game and total goals. As a result, she became the third Northwestern player in the past six years to win the Tewaaraton Award as women's lacrosse National Player of the Year. At the time of winning the award, she led the nation in points and goals, setting a Northwestern single-season record for the latter.\nIn 2012, Smith helped the Wildcats win their seventh championship title in eight years by defeating Syracuse University 8–6. Following this, she became the school's all-time leading goal scorer and was named the NCAA championship MVP for the second straight season. Smith concluded her collegiate career at Northwestern as their all-time leading goal scorer with 254, three-time IWLCA first-team All-American, three-time All-ALC first-team choice, and a two-time MVP of the NCAA Championship.\nCoaching.\nFollowing Northwestern, Smith considered attending graduate school or pursuing a job on Wall Street but instead accepted the head coaching position with the Hofstra Pride's Women's Lacrosse team. During her first year with the team, Smith was named the head coach for the 2012 Under Armour All-America Lacrosse Classic. Within her first three years in this position, she led the Pride to 26 wins including appearances in the Colonial Athletic Association Championship tournament. In 2015, Smith lead the Pride to an 11-win season and a regular season Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) title.\nAs a result of her lacrosse play, Smith was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame, West Babylon Hall of Fame, and Northwestern Hall of Fame."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a first baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) before the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). First base, or 1B, is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner in order to score a run for that player's team. A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\nFirst basemen are most commonly credited with an assist when they field a ground ball and either throw the ball to the pitcher covering first base to retire the batter/runner or throw the ball to the shortstop covering the second base to force out a runner, perhaps beginning a double play. Other common ways in which first basemen gain an assist are by throwing out a runner attempting to reach third base or score, perhaps on a relay throw from the right fielder, throwing out a runner attempting to score on a squeeze play, rundown plays in which a runner is stranded between bases, throwing out a runner attempting to steal second base on a pickoff throw, and throwing to second base after catching a line drive to retire a runner before they can tag up. First basemen typically accumulate less than half as many assists as other infielders, partially because the ball is less frequently batted to the right side of the field, but also because in situations with a runner on first base, the first baseman will typically be stationed on or close to the bag to receiver a pickoff throw, reducing the area of the infield which they can easily cover. Because a right-handed first baseman needs to turn their body before throwing across the infield, left-handed first basemen are often preferred for defensive purposes; 10 of the top 14 career assist leaders are left-handed.\nEddie Murray is the all-time leader with 1,865 career assists. Only 57 first basemen have recorded 1,000 or more career assists, with Joey Votto being the only active."

For his first two seasons, he produced decent numbers but wasn't able to help the team finish any better than 5th in the 6-team WCHA. As a junior, the team got marginally better, recording a winning season for the first time since he joined the squad but still ended up 5th in the standings (now with 8 teams in the conference). All of that changed in his senior season.\nDenver jumped out to a fast start in 1985 and rode the success to a first-place finish. Smith nearly doubled his career best offensive output and led the defensive corps in scoring, ending up in a tie for 5th in the nation from the blueline. He was named an All-American and helped the Pioneers win the WCHA Tournament for the first time since 1973. They also made their first NCAA Tournament for the first time in 13 years and reached the Frozen Four.\nAfter graduating, Smith was able to use the success he found as a senior to continue his playing career. He produced respectable numbers for the Adirondack Red Wings over a season and a half but retired as a player in 1988."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a right fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) before the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). The right fielder (RF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. The right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders must try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The right fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of right field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder farthest from third base, the right fielder often has to make longer throws than the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often have the strongest or most accurate throwing arm. The right fielder normally plays behind the second baseman and first baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, right fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9, the highest number.\nRight fielders are most commonly credited with an assist when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Right fielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Right fielders also earn assists on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch. Outfielders record far fewer assists than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more assists in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Assists are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication about an outfielder's throwing arm than assists by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 1890s through 1920s, including the dead-ball era, due to that period's emphasis on more aggressive baserunning. Eight of the top nine players were active before 1930; only six of the top 19 players were active after 1950, none of them after 1992. Only 15 of the top 102 single-season totals were recorded after 1936, and only four after 1978; only 16 of the top 268 have been recorded since 1990. Because game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics before 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate assist totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Harry Hooper is the all-time leader in career assists as a right fielder with 333; he is the only right fielder with more than 300 career assists. Jason Heyward, who had 67 assists through the 2022 season to place him 115th all-time, is the leader among active players."

Meanwhile, the other linebackers are blocked on combo blocks from the offensive line. It is one of the most commonly run concepts in football, and is useful in most situations.\nTypes/variants.\nIso plays are almost always run out of I formations due to the fact that they require a fullback, however, coaches have developed many ways to run them.\nQuarterback Iso.\nThe quarterback iso is a recently developed variant of the iso that is run out of shotgun and pistol formations. Often seen at the youth and high school levels of football, it takes advantage of mobile quarterbacks and uses the halfback as the lead blocker rather than a fullback. It is successful against defenses that put a limited number of players in the box.\nRequirements.\nThe play requires a fullback to be successful, and is therefore almost always run out of I-formations.

        "text": "Cycling on CBS is the de facto name for broadcasts of multiple-stage bicycle races produced by CBS Sports, the sports division of the CBS television network. CBS was notably the first American television network to provide coverage of the Tour de France. CBS also provided coverage of Paris–Roubaix during the 1980s.\nOverview.\nTour de France coverage.\nCBS first covered the Tour de France in 1980, airing approximately five minutes of action. During that time, CBS typically taped segments of the beginning of the stage in order to air them the following weekend on \"CBS Sports Sunday\". The final stage would however, be broadcast live.\nOn April 7, 1985, CBS entered into an agreement with Broadcasting Rights International Corporation to retain the American television broadcasting rights to the Tour de France through 1988. The agreement was said to initially be worth approximately $50,000 with an additional $237,000 for the broadcasting rights to the 1987 tour. By 1986, CBS would devote to hours of coverage for five consecutive weekends.\nWhen CBS broadcast their final Tour de France in 1988, their coverage for the first three weekends consisted of highlights and features. Tim Brant and Phil Liggett served as hosts for the telecasts airing under the \"CBS Sports Sunday\" umbrella. CBS would however, air the final stage live on July 24.\nIn 2001, the Outdoor Life Network (or OLN) replaced ABC and ESPN as the principal American television broadcaster for the Tour de France. The network in the process, purchased air time on CBS, where three one-hour tape delayed specials would air on Sunday afternoons. These specials mainly recapped the past few days of action from the final three weeks of the tour. CBS however, devoted hours to the final stage of the tour on \"CBS Sports Spectacular\". In total, the arrangement with OLN and CBS was worth approximately $3.3 million.\nCBS employed the services of commentators Armen Keteyian, Phil Liggett, and Paul Sherwen. In 2006, Bob Neumeier succeeded Armen Keteyian as the host. The following year, Craig Hummer succeeded Neumeier in the hosting role for CBS.\nIn 2008, Greg Amsinger hosted the Tour de France for CBS.\nCBS' involvement with the Tour de France once again ended when NBC took over the American broadcast television network rights in 2011.\nTour of America.\nIn 1983, CBS teamed with World Tour Cycling to devote at least 27 minutes to the Tour of America, which was a 130 km race from Williamsburg, Virginia to Richmond, Virginia.\nParis–Roubaix.\nCBS began covering Paris–Roubaix in 1984 and continued on through 1988, when the coverage like with the Tour de France moved over to ABC. Theo de Rooij, a Dutchman, had been in a promising position to win the 1985 race but had then crashed, losing his chance of winning. Covered in mud, he offered his thoughts on the race to John Tesh after the race:\n\"It's a bollocks, this race!” said de Rooij. \"You're working like an animal, you don't have time to piss, you wet your pants. You're riding in mud like this, you're slipping ... it’s a pile of shit\".\nWhen then asked if he would start the race again, de Rooij replied:\n\"Sure, it's the most beautiful race in the world!”\nTour DuPont.\nIn 1991, CBS succeeded NBC in provided broadcast network coverage of the Tour DuPont. While ESPN would provide daily, 30-minute long recaps each weeknight, CBS would provide their coverage on May 12 and May 19 as part of \"CBS Sports Sunday\". The following year, CBS again provided two weeks worth of coverage, this time on May 10 and May 17 on 3 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. Eastern time respectively. Jim Gray anchored the broadcasts alongside Phil Liggett and James Brown. By 1994, when \"CBS Sports Sunday\" was now branded as \"Eye on Sports\", CBS devoted at least two hours to the finale on May 15. James Brown once again helped anchor the coverage."

        "text": "The Carleton Ravens women's basketball team represent Carleton University in the Ontario University Athletics of U Sports women's basketball. The Ravens have won two national championships, in 2018 and 2023. The Ravens have also won the OUA Critelli Cup conference championship three times, in 2017, 2018, and 2023. Between 2009 and 2018, the Ruth Coe Award, recognizing Carleton University’s Female Athlete of the Year, was won by seven female basketball players. Additionally, the program served as host team for the 2020 U Sports Women's Basketball Championship, contested at Ottawa's TD Place Arena.\nIn 2023, both the women’s and men’s teams won the national titles, something no school had accomplished since 1985, when the Victoria Vikes were double champions. \nHistory.\nFrom 2007 to 2019, the Ravens were coached by Taffe Charles. An assistant coach with the women’s program in 1995, he would join Dave Smart’s coaching staff with the Ravens men’s team in 1998, enjoying five U SPORTS national championships, before returning to the women’s program in 2007.\nUnder Charles’ leadership, the women’s team captured the 2010 OUA East Division title, qualifying for the OUA East postseason finals. It would mark the first of five division titles. The Ravens would top the East Division in 2013, 2014 and 2018, while the 2016-17 season saw a first place finish in the OUA North Division. Clinching its first appearance in the U Sports Final 8 in 2011, the program would return to the biggest stage in Canadian university basketball in 2013, 2017 and 2018.\nThe 2012-13 season saw the Ravens among the top five in the national basketball rankings, defeating the Ottawa Gee-Gees to win the East Division Final. Finishing the 2016-17 season with an 18-1 mark, its highest win total in the 45-year history of the program (since broken), the Ravens would enjoy the milestone of a number-1 ranking in the national polls, reaching the summit on November 15, 2016. Reaching the U Sports Final 8, the Ravens defeated the Victoria Vikes in the quarterfinals, enjoying their first-ever win at the tournament.\nWinning the OUA conference title in 2017 and 2018, the Ravens enjoyed a perfect 29-0 record, for their first-ever undefeated season, capturing the Bronze Baby for the first time in 2018. Defensively, the Ravens stymied their competition during the championship season, averaging merely 45.9 points per game, resulting in the finest defense in U Sports.\nElizabeth Leblanc was a key player during the 2017-18 season, culminating in a perfect 29-0 season, highlighted by the program's first national championship. Statistically, Leblanc averaged 26.7 minutes per game, signifying her third straight season of leading the team. With 10.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 blocks per game, Leblanc also won the U Sports Defensive Player of the Year Award, the first player in Ravens history to do so.\nThe season also saw Heather Lindsay garner some hardware, capturing the Carleton Ravens Athletics Outstanding Graduating Female Athlete award. In what proved to be her last campaign as a Raven, Lindsay reached the plateau of 100 regular season appearances, complemented by 82 starts. With career averages of 11.1 points, 9.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game, she graduated by surpassing the 1000-point career mark.\nDuring the 2018-19 season, Nicole Gilmore reached career-highs in many categories. Starting with 14.3 points-per-game, 7.7 rebounds per game, plus shooting 40.5 per cent from the field, she received the Carleton Ravens Outstanding Graduating Female Athlete Award.\nAwards and honours.\nOUA Awards.\nOUA All-Stars.\nFirst team\nSecond team\nUniversity honors.\n\"Ruth Coe Award\"\n\"Outstanding Graduating Women’s Athlete of the Year\"\nTeam awards.\n\"This is an incomplete list\""

        "title": "Rugby 20",
        "text": "Rugby 20 is a rugby union simulation video game developed by Eko Software and published by Bigben Interactive for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.\nDetails.\nRugby 20 is the only rugby union video game that exclusively features the best competitions and national teams in the Northern Hemisphere whilst the rights for the English national rugby team and other licences such as the Super Rugby competition, the Australian, Fijian, New Zealander and South African national teams are exclusively owned by their current rivals in the rugby video game industry, Rugby Challenge 4. However, neither rugby game officially detains the rights to include the official Rugby World Cup competition as a playable competition in their respective games.\nModes.\nThe game retains some modes the previous rugby game developed and published by EKO Software and Big Ben Interactive respectively and also includes a wide variety of different modes that were not in Rugby 18. These modes include:\nQuick match mode.\nThe game makes it possible for people to play a quick match alone or with another person using the same console, or gamers can decide to play online against strangers or friends using up-to-date teams from any of the licensed competitions such as the Pro14, Top 14, Pro D2, Gallagher Premiership and various national teams.\nLeague mode.\nLeague mode is a mode that allows players to pick their favourite sides in any of the playable leagues and lead them to victory by either playing the league matches or simulating them.\nTraining mode.\nTraining mode is a new addition to the many other modes in Rugby 20 that allows players to practise their skills, whether it is going through set-plays, improving their tackling in game, perfecting passes, learning how and when to involve kicking in their game etc.\nChallenges mode.\nLike in Rugby 18, Rugby 20 constantly provides players a list of challenges which vary in difficulty, thus allowing them to gain SP points in order to possibly buy booster cards from the collection modes and/or to level up one's player profiles.\nMy squad mode.\nThe mode makes a re-appearance in the game, this time however, allowing players to create and edit the badge and kit of their fictional rugby team as well as designing the style and colours of the balls that they play with in their games. These teams can then be used in the solo mode or in offline and online matches as well.\nSolo mode.\nA new and exciting feature in the series, solo mode enables people take their \"My squad\" from the D3 Gaul Division to the Elite Gaul Division or from the Celtic Championship - Development Division to the Celtic Championship - Star Division by hiring staff members, training their players` abilities and playing friendlies for extra SP points to ultimately get promoted each season if possible into a higher division and eventually, winning the highest division(s) that exist in the game.\nCollection mode.\nSimilar to FIFA 20's Ultimate Team Market, the collection mode lets gamers buy players by buying booster cards with SP points in order to recruit players into their \"My squad\" team which can be used to play in the solo mode.\nFeatures.\nThe weather in Rugby 20 now includes rainy day and a rainy night conditions along with clear day and clear night conditions which plays a large part in gameplay as rain causes pitches to deform in appearance while wind can randomly occur, possibly affecting the projection of the ball when kicked or passed, and for the first time in the series, player ratings would be given according to their Rugby Pass Index rating, where statistic specialists from Rugby Pass would use raw data from real-life games to give players ratings accordingly.\nTeams and stadia.\nThe game features the licence for all clubs in the Top 14, Pro D2, Gallagher Premiership and the Pro14. The national teams included in the game are Argentina (Un-licensed), Australia (Un-licensed), Canada, England (Un-licensed), Fiji (Un-licensed), France, Georgia, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Namibia, New Zealand (Un-licensed), Russia, Samoa, Scotland, South Africa (Un-licensed), Uruguay (Un-licensed), USA and Wales. There are also 10 un-licensed stadiums that range from amateur level stadiums to professional level stadiums.\nCommentary.\nCommentary is once again provided in English by BT Sport's lead commentator Nick Mullins and is joined by England rugby legend Ben Kay whereas French commentary is provided by Canal+ Sport's lead commentator Éric Bayle and he is joined by former French rugby centre Thomas Lombard.\nReception.\n\"Rugby 20\" received \"generally mixed\" reviews for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\"Screen Rant\" gave the game a score of two and a half stars out of five and stated, \"Intuitive controls make up a key part of why \"Rugby 20\" can sometimes feel close to the real thing. Defensive gameplay in particular matches up well with the feel of watching a rugby match, and diving into tackles or frantically pressing to overpower the opposition works well. Another strong design choice was to use the bumper buttons to pass right and left, helping to try and recreate the flow of the sport.\" Whilst \"RUCK\" did not give the game a score, their analysis of the games was \"Does \"Rugby 20\" kick the ball through those goal posts? Not quite, but almost. \"Rugby 20\" is as close to the sport as you can get without getting covered in mud, but it would be very difficult for a casual fan to pick up and play due to very complicated controls.\" Also Last Word on Rugby stated that the Rugby 20 is \"a step forward for rugby games.\" and that the gameplay of the game is \"another vast improvement upon previous versions of rugby games. It is easy to be overawed with the sheer volume of controls. However, the gameplay is intuitive and easy to pick up making it an enjoyable experience for all. Rugby is an extremely complex game so some of its more nuanced facets are slightly clunky.\""

He has previously played in MLB for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nRobertson attended Franklin County High School in Rocky Mount, Virginia, and James Madison University, where he played college baseball for the James Madison Dukes. \nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers selected Robertson in the 7th round, with the 221st overall selection, of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. Robertson spent his first professional season with the rookie-level Arizona League Dodgers and Ogden Raptors.

Winning the OWIAA Championship, the Badgers emerged with the bronze medal at the CIAU (now U Sports) Championships. They would become the first Brock women's team inducted into the Badgers Athletics Hall of Fame.\nIn 2018, Mike Rao, a native of Welland, Ontario was appointed as head coach for the Badgers. During Rao's first season, the Badgers won 11 games, compared to 13 losses. Qualifying for the postseason, the Badgers enjoyed their first playoff victory since 2012. Reaching the second round, they were bested by the eventual national champion McMaster Marauders.

Against the Western Mustangs, ranked fifth in the country, in the OUA Semi-Finals, Keltos registered 17 points for the sixth-ranked Badgers, along with seven rebounds, as the Badgers prevailed in a 69–65 final. For her efforts, Keltos was recognized as both, the OUA and U Sports Female Athlete of the Week.\nChallenging the Ryerson Rams on February 29, 2020, in the Critelli Cup Final, Keltos logged 42 points, resulting in an emotional victory, as it marked the Badgers first provincial title since 1983. Shooting 10-for-15 in the opening half, she wound up as the Lululemon Player of the Game honours.\nFrom three-point range, she went eight-of-nine, adding 12 rebounds, Keltos enjoyed her seventh career double-double, part of a statistical performance including three steals and a pair of assists. Winning the Critelli Cup, there was a sense of serendipity for the program. Of note, the Cup, awarded to the OUA Provincial Champion, is named in honour of former Brock basketball Coach and Assistant Athletic Director Chris Critelli.\nThe 2019–20 season marked a storybook ending for Melissa Tatti. Earning a trio of honors, highlighted by the 2019-20 OUA Player of the Year Award, OUA First-Team All-Star recognition, plus the pinnacle of a spot on the U SPORTS First Team All-Canadians, she would also establish herself among the program's statistical leaders. Finishing her Badgers career with 1,458 points in 100 games played, it ranks second in all-time regular-season scoring. She would also graduate as the program's all-time regular season leader in five statistical categories: field goals (507), assists (423), steals (303), free throws (243) and three-pointers (201).\nAt the 2020 U SPORTS Women's National Championships, Keltos was the Badgers scoring leader in each of their three contests. In addition, Samantha Keltos was named the Nike Top Performer (in recognition of each participating team's Player of the Game) in those three contests. Starting with 24 points in a 72–71 triumph versus the Calgary Dinos, she would follow it up with 23 points and 17 rebounds in a convincing 69–55 win versus the UPEI Panthers. In the gold medal game, marking the program's first appearance in the national championship game, she registered 21 points in an 82–64 loss versus the Saskatchewan Huskies women's basketball program.\nIn the 2020 U Sports National Championship Game, Samantha Keltos had 21 points, two rebounds and one assist.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a shortstop leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a second baseman might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the second baseman would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is a baseball or softball fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. The position is mostly filled by defensive specialists, so shortstops are generally relatively poor batters who typically hit lower in the batting order. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.\nShortstops are most commonly credited with an assist when they field a ground ball and throw the ball either to the first baseman to retire the batter/runner, or to the second baseman or third baseman to force out a runner, perhaps beginning a double play. Other common ways in which shortstops gain an assist are by throwing out a runner attempting to score, perhaps on a relay throw from the left fielder, rundown plays in which a runner is stranded between bases, throwing out a runner attempting to steal third base on a pickoff throw, and throwing to second or third base after catching a line drive in order to retire a runner before they can tag up. Second basemen and shortstops typically accumulate far more assists than players at other positions due to the frequency of ground balls to the middle infielders; the top six major league players in career assists were all primarily shortstops, and 7,354 of Rabbit Maranville's record 8,967 career assists were earned as a shortstop.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, assist totals for shortstops have likewise declined, and only two of the top seven career leaders have been active since 1973. Through 2022, none of the top 21 single-season totals have been recorded since 1988, and only five of the top 120 since 1993. Ozzie Smith is the all-time leader in career assists as a shortstop with 8,375, the most by any player in major league history at any single position. Luis Aparicio (8,016) is the only other shortstop to record more than 8,000 career assists."

        "text": "The men's national basketball team of the United States won the gold medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The Olympics were delayed a year until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal for the Americans. Team USA qualified for the Olympics by finishing as one of the top two teams from the Americas at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in 2019.\nThe U.S. saw two Olympic gold medal winners in Kevin Durant (2012, 2016) and Draymond Green (2016) return, while 10 other players made their Olympic debuts. Unlike the 2019 World Cup team that finished in seventh place with a team of traditional centers and limited shooting, the Olympic team featured multi-positional players and adept shooters. After the disappointing World Cup, in which only four of the initial 35 candidates were on the final roster, star players began openly expressing an interest in joining the Olympic team. While other countries had a core roster that has played together for years in multiple international tournaments, the U.S. team changed every year.\nComplicating the decision for National Basketball Association (NBA) players to commit to the Olympics was the pandemic's impact on the league's schedule. The 2020 NBA Finals did not end until October 11, 2020. Although the start of the 2020–21 NBA season was delayed, it still began 71 days after the prior Finals, as opposed to the usual 100 days or more. The season was condensed with many back-to-back games. While the 2021 Finals were scheduled to allow players time to travel to Tokyo, the playoffs were ongoing while other countries were practicing. The delayed season cut into Team USA's time to gel and learn to play as a team. Moreover, three team members played in the Finals, which did not conclude until July 20, and they missed all of training camp and the pre-Olympic exhibitions in Las Vegas. The United States played their first game in the Olympics on July 25.\nRoster.\nThe United States was coached by Gregg Popovich, who had won five NBA championships as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs. He made his head coaching debut for Team USA on the 2019 World Cup team in China. In February 2020, USA Basketball announced an initial list of 44 finalists for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled for July–Aug 2020. After the Games were postponed until 2021, the list of finalists was expanded to 57 to remain flexible. By the end of the 2020–21 NBA season, a number of All-Star level players were either injured or requiring extended recovery time for the upcoming season. Olympic training camp took place while the 2021 NBA playoffs were ongoing. No tryouts were held, with decisions on the final 12-man roster based in part on player health and availability.\nAn initial 12-man roster was named with a combined 37 NBA All-Star selections, led by Kevin Durant with 11. He entered the 2020 Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points, needing just 25 more to match Carmelo Anthony's record of 336. A two-time Olympic gold medalist from the 2012 and 2016 teams, Durant was joined on the squad by one other gold medal winner, his 2016 teammate Draymond Green, who he also played with on the Golden State Warriors. Also committing to the team were four of the NBA's top 10 scorers from the 2020–21 season with Bradley Beal (31.1 points per game), Damian Lillard (28.8), Zach LaVine (27.4) and Jayson Tatum (26.4). Six players on the roster were named All-Stars in 2021, but only two were among the past season's 15 selections to the All-NBA Team—Lillard (first team) and Beal (second team). While stocked with scorers, the original roster was limited in size; Bam Adebayo and 2012 Olympic gold medalist Kevin Love were the lone traditional interior players. The team also lacked a primary facilitating guard; when not leading a pick and roll, Lillard is primarily an isolation scorer. Alternatively, the United States could use Durant as a point forward and utilize big men Green and Adebayo's playmaking skills. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton of the Milwaukee Bucks and Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns were named to the roster, but missed all of training camp and the exhibition games while playing in the 2021 NBA Finals. Middleton and Tatum were the only returnees from the 2019 World Cup team.\nAfter playing in three exhibition games, Beal was ruled out for the Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19. A starter in all three games, he was expected to be one of the team's primary scorers. Love also withdrew from the team, stating that he was not fully recovered from a right calf injury that sidelined him for much of the prior NBA season. They were replaced by JaVale McGee and Keldon Johnson. A journeyman, , shot-blocking center, McGee was a finalist for the Olympic team and has won three NBA championships, including two with Durant and Green on the Warriors. He helped to fill Team USA's need for size after being outrebounded during exhibition games. The second-year forward Johnson had been playing with the Olympic team as a member of the U.S. Select Team and had been with San Antonio for two seasons under Popovich. USA Basketball director Jerry Colangelo stated that injuries and players' contract status, among other factors, impacted the roster decisions. \"Some people say, ‘Well what about that guy?’ Well, there is a reason. You think we're stupid? We know who can play and who can't play\", he said.\nThe following were also candidates to make the team: \nExhibition games.\nWith Booker, Holiday, and Middleton still playing in the NBA Finals, Team USA added seven players to the roster from the U.S. Select Team for the exhibition games: Saddiq Bey, Darius Garland, John Jenkins, Keldon Johnson, Josh Magette, Dakota Mathias and Cam Reynolds. The Americans began their exhibition schedule after four days of training camp. They played four games in eight days, with a fifth game cancelled because of coronavirus issues. Johnson was promoted to the Olympic team before the final exhibition game. The Americans did not play with the signature up-tempo style of the past three Olympic gold-medal teams under former coach Mike Krzyzewski. Their slower pace left the team, unfamiliar with each other after only six practices, dependent on reading and reacting to each other.\nNigeria.\nIn their first game, the United States was upset 90–87 by Nigeria, the first win by an African team over the American men's team. The Nigerians played as a more cohesive unit after about three weeks of training. In their last two meetings, Team USA had beaten them by 83 points at the 2012 London Olympics and 44 points in an exhibition game prior to the 2016 Rio Olympics. The Americans fell to 54–3 in major exhibitions games since 1992, when NBA players were first allowed to play for Team USA, with previous losses to Australia ahead of the 2019 World Cup and to Italy before the 2004 Olympics.\nAustralia.\nTeam USA lost their second straight exhibition game 91–83 to Australia. It was the fourth loss in five games for the Americans dating back to the 2019 World Cup. The Americans held a 10-point lead in the second half, but they were held without a field goal in the last 4:34. The Boomers, who shot 53% from the field, were led by Patty Mills with 22 points and Joe Ingles with 17. The United States got 22 points from Damian Lillard and 17 from Kevin Durant.\nArgentina.\nDurant and Bradley Beal both scored 17, and the Americans led throughout in a 108–80 win over Argentina. The United States jumped to a 15–4 lead almost minutes into the game, scoring 33 points in the first quarter while leading by as much as 17. They led 58–42 at halftime, and shot 51% for the game. Argentina was held to 31% shooting on 3-pointers, making 9 of 29. They were led by Luis Scola, who scored 16 points in 19 minutes.\nAlready missing three players to the NBA Finals, Team USA was down to eight Olympic players after Jayson Tatum was held out of the game due to a sore right knee. The win avoided the first U.S. three-game losing streak since NBA players were allowed on the national team.\nAustralia.\nA day before it was scheduled to be played, USA Basketball announced that their second game against Australia was canceled \"out of an abundance of caution\" after Beal and Jerami Grant had been placed on COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Beal, who tested positive, was also ruled out for the Olympics.\nSpain.\nLillard scored 19 points and newly promoted teammate Johnson had 15 in the United States' 83–76 win over Spain. Behind by as many as nine points in the first half, Team USA was down 46–42 in the third quarter when they scored 11 unanswered points in a 23–6 run that spanned into the fourth quarter. Johnson scored eight points during the spurt, including a dunk which excited the crowd. The Americans led 65–52 with 7:30 remaining, and Spain never got closer than seven points. The Spaniards were led by Ricky Rubio with 23 points.\nDurant, Lillard, and LaVine made a combined nine 3-pointers. Johnson shot 7 of 9 and had a team-high plus–minus (sports) of plus-18. Grant returned to the team after being in health and safety protocols. Johnson had appeared in two previous exhibition games. JaVale McGee, who was added to the team with Johnson, was present but did not play.\nOlympic play.\nAfter the final exhibition game against Spain, LaVine was placed into health and safety protocols, and did not travel with the rest of the team to Tokyo on July 19. He was later cleared and joined the team on July 22. The NBA Finals concluded in six games on July 20, with Milwaukee winning over Phoenix. Holiday and Middleton attended the Bucks' championship parade on July 22. They flew the next day to Seattle, where they took a private plane with Booker and arrived in Tokyo on July 24 before 11:00 pm JST (UTC+9), less than 24 hours before Team USA's opening game against France. The Americans lost to the French, but recovered to finish 2–1 in group play to advance to the knockout round.\nPreliminary round.\nThe Olympics feature 12 nations divided into three groups of four. The United States was placed in Group A. Each team plays three games, one game each against the other teams in their group. The first- and second-place teams advance to the knockout stage, along with the top two third-place teams. The remaining four teams are eliminated.\n\"All times are JST (UTC+9)\"\nFrance.\nTeam USA's 25-game winning streak in the Olympics ended after a 83–76 loss to France. The Americans led by seven points in the final 3:30 of the game, but the French took the lead for good after Evan Fournier made a 3-pointer with a minute remaining. He scored a game-high 28 points on 11-for-22 shooting. On the next possession, the United States attempted five shots but missed them all, the last three being open 3-point attempts by LaVine, Durant, and Holiday. France ended the game on a 16–2 run, and the Americans did not make a basket in the last minutes of the game.\nThe Americans led by 10 early in the third quarter after Durant made the opening shot after halftime. Their offense, however, went stagnant. After France played big men Rudy Gobert and Vincent Poirier together for most of the second half, the United States scored just 29 points in the final 18 minutes. Durant picked up his fourth foul with 16:45 left in the game. Nando de Colo made a 3-pointer with 2:42 left in the third to give France a 55–54 lead, and they outscored the U.S. team 25–11 in the period to enter the fourth quarter up 62–56. Holiday opened the fourth scoring 12 points in the first minutes, and Team USA led by six with 5:23 left.\nGobert scored 14 points for France and de Colo finished with 13. Holiday had a team-high 18 points for the United States and added seven rebounds and four assists in 27 minutes off the bench. Despite having just arrived in Tokyo, he was the team's best player. However, their main scorers were quiet towards the finish. In foul trouble, Durant made just 4 of 12 for 10 points in one of the worst games of his Olympic career. Lillard was 3 of 10 for 11 points. The team made just 31% of its 3-pointers. Adebayo added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Americans. The other NBA Finals players, Booker and Middleton, both played, but not as effectively as Holiday, who also led the team in minutes (27:52). The United States and France last met in the 2019 World Cup, when the French eliminated the Americans from medal contention. France returned seven players on their Olympic team from that squad. Team USA's last loss in the Olympics was in 2004, when they settled for a bronze medal in Athens.\nIran.\nThe United States earned its first win in a 120–66 blowout over an overmatched Iran team. Lillard bounced back from his struggles in the opener to score 21 points on seven 3-pointers, including six of Team USA's 13 makes in the first half. They led 28–12 after the first quarter, expanding the margin to 30 after LaVine made their 10th three-pointer in 17 attempts to open the game, making it 47–17. The U.S. squad was 19 of 39 on 3-pointers, and made 23 of its 37 attempts (62%) inside the three-point line. Iran was ranked No. 23 in the world, ahead of only Japan—which qualified as the host country—in the 12-team Olympic field.\nPopovich moved Holiday and Booker into the starting lineup in place of LaVine and Green. The Americans played faster with the three-guard lineup, scoring 19 fast-break points in the first half. The pace, in turn, led to a succession of open shots. Six U.S. players made multiple 3-pointers. Team USA had 34 assists on 42 baskets, and six players scored in double fugures. Booker had 16 points and had five rebounds, Tatum scored 14 and LaVine added 13. The United States defense forced 23 turnovers, which led to 37 points. Iran's center Hamed Haddadi led the team with 15 points and six rebounds. They shot just 37% for the game.\nCzech Republic.\nThe U.S. team defeated the Czech Republic 119–84 to advance to the quarterfinals. Tatum scored a game-high 27 points, and Durant had 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists. The Czechs made eight of their first 11 shots to establish a 10-point lead, and they led the entire first quarter, outshooting the Americans 65% to 35%. Durant made a 3-pointer in the second quarter to put Team USA up for good. The basket also moved him past Carmelo Anthony to become the U.S. men's basketball team's all-time Olympic scoring leader. Durant scored 14 points in the first half, and the Americans led by as many as seven before going into halftime ahead 47–43. They outscored the Czech Republic 29–13 in the third quarter, which they ended with a 22–6 run to lead by 22 to begin the fourth. Tatum scored 17 in the final quarter while Durant rested.\nAfter making just seven of 20 shots in the first quarter, the United States shot 33 of 44 over the next 26 minutes, including 21 of 25 to open the second half. Lavine scored 13 points, Holiday added 11, and McGee finished with 10. Holiday was again outstanding on defense, providing constant pressure on the ball and recording three steals. Blake Schilb led the Czechs with 17 points.\nKnockout round.\nAs the top second-place team in group play, the United States qualified for the seeded pot of the draw and avoided facing any of the group winners in the quarterfinals. They were drawn to face Spain, who the Americans beat for the gold medal in 2008 and 2012, and who they also defeated in the 2016 semifinals. Durant averaged 27 points per game and shot 53.7% from the field in the three knockout games to lead the team to gold.\nQuarterfinal – Spain.\nDurant scored 29 points and Team USA advanced to the medal round with a 95–81 win over Spain. The Americans trailed by 10 in the second quarter, before outscoring the Spaniards 36–10 over the next nine minutes. Durant had 13 points in the third quarter, include three 3-pointers, to help the team overcome its sluggish start. The United States was 9 of 15 on 3-pointers in the second half after making only 4 of 17 in the first. Ricky Rubio scored a game-high 38 points, which also set an Olympic record for Spain. It was the most points scored against the U.S. team in the Olympics or any other major event, surpassing Dirk Nowitzki's 34 points for Germany against the Americans in the 2002 World Championship.\nSpain was behind 17–10 early, but went on a 29–12 run over 10 minutes and led 39–29 with 3:25 remaining in the first half. However, Team USA went on its own spurt, outscoring the Spaniards 14–4 and tying the score 43–43 at halftime after scoring seven straight in the final 70 seconds. The United States opened the third quarter with a 22–6 run, and they led by as many as 16 before entering the fourth up 69–63. Durant shot 10 for 17 from the field, including 4 of 7 on 3-pointers. He led five Americans who scored in double figures, including Tatum (13), Holiday (12) Lillard (11), and LaVine (10). Sergio Rodríguez scored 16 and Willy Hernangómez added 10 for Spain.\nSemifinal – Australia.\nDurant scored a game-high 23 points, and the United States overcame another slow start for a 97–78 victory against Australia. The Americans trailed the Boomers by 15 midway through the second quarter, before a 48–14 run put them ahead 74–55 after three quarters. After Team USA missed their first 10 three-pointers of the game, Booker hit their first late in the second period with 3:22 left. He scored 11 points in the third and finished with 20 points and three 3-pointers. Patty Mills led the Australians with 15 points, but he shot just 5 of 14.\nAustralia took an early eight-point lead while holding the United States to only one basket in the first four minutes. The Aussies led 24–18 to start the second quarter. They scored eight straight points to lead 41–26 with 5:23 left in the first half. After making 13 of their first 26 shots, the Boomers made just 3 of their next 16, including just one basket the rest of the half. They still led by 11 points with 2:59 remaining, but Team USA scored the last eight points of the half to cut the deficit to 45–42. Holiday made two baskets and Durant hit three in the Americans' 12–0 run to start the second half, part of a combined 20–0 stretch over 6:56 from the second quarter. They outscored Australia 32–10 in the third. Durant made 10 of 19 shots in the contest and had a game-high nine rebounds. Team USA got 11 points each from Middleton and Holiday, who also finished with eight rebounds and eight assists and was the primary defender on Mills. Dante Exum scored 12 points and Jock Landale added 11 points for the Australians.\nFinal – France.\nLed by 29 points by Durant, Team USA won their fourth consecutive gold medal with an 87–82 win over France. The Americans led by 10 to begin the fourth quarter, but the French pulled to within three points twice, including with 10 seconds left in the game. Durant made two free throws to seal the game with eight seconds remaining. Tatum scored 19 points off the bench for the United States. France got 16 points each from Fournier and Gobert, who also had eight rebounds. Durant joined Carmelo Anthony as the only three-time gold medalists in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history.\nFrance took a 10–4 lead in the game's opening minutes. After the U.S. squad missed their first eight 3-pointers of the contest, Durant made one with 2:04 left in the first quarter, beginning a 21–8 stretch for the Americans for a 39–26 lead in the middle of the second. The French, however, used a 13–5 run to trail just 44–39 at halftime. They pulled to within two early in the third quarter. Team USA was momentarily up by 14, but Batum made a 3-pointer before the third-quarter buzzer to cut the U.S. lead to 71–63 entering the last quarter. After a Frank Ntilikina 3-pointer brought France to within 73–70 with 5:42 remaining, the United States went on a 9–2 spurt to lead by 10. Durant's free throws with 8.8 seconds left put the Americans ahead by five. He averaged 20.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the Olympics, and FIBA named him the tournament's MVP.\nFrance tried to leverage the Gobert's size advantage, forcing Durant to switch onto him. Gobert drew nine fouls, three on Durant, but he shot just 6 of 13 on his free throws. In another stout performance on defense, Holiday had three steals and a block and helped limit Fournier to 5-of-15 shooting from the field. Holiday and Middleton became the fifth and sixth players to win an NBA championship and Olympic gold in the same year, joining Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James. France received the silver medal for the third time in the Olympics, all coming in gold-medal-game losses to the United States.\nStatistics.\nSource:"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a third baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). Third base, or 3B, is the third of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner in order to score a run for that player's team. A third baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest third base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5. The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, often being the closest infielder (roughly 90–120 feet) to the batter. The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base. The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play, and must also field fly balls in both fair and foul territory.\nThird basemen are most commonly credited with an assist when they field a ground ball and throw the ball either to the first baseman to retire the batter/runner, or to the second baseman to force out a runner, perhaps beginning a double play. Other common ways in which third basemen gain an assist are by throwing out a runner attempting to score (perhaps on a squeeze play), perhaps on a relay throw from the left fielder, rundown plays in which a runner is stranded between bases, throwing out a runner attempting to steal home on a pickoff throw, and throwing to first or second base after catching a line drive in order to retire a runner before they can tag up. Third basemen typically accumulate fewer assists than second basemen or shortstops due to the frequency of ground balls to the middle infielders, but far more than players at other positions.\nBecause the physical demands of playing third base historically hindered players from having long careers at the position, all but three of the 25 third basemen with the longest careers have reached the major leagues since 1943; even as increasing strikeouts in baseball have reduced the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs, longer seasons and careers in recent decades have more than compensated for the difference. The top 15 leaders in career assists at third base all reached the major leagues after 1950, and all but nine of the top 62 single-season totals have been recorded since 1957. Brooks Robinson is the all-time leader in career assists as a third baseman with 6,205, which was 1,624 more than any other player at the time of his retirement; he remains the only third baseman with more than 6,000 career assists."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as an outfielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). An outfielder (OF) is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter, who are identified as the left fielder (LF), the center fielder (CF), and the right fielder (RF). An outfielder's duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, outfielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the outfielders are assigned the numbers 7 (left field), 8 (center field), and 9 (right field).\nOutfielders are most commonly credited with an assist when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Outfielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Outfielders also earn assists on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch; in extraordinary instances, right fielders have occasionally recorded assists by throwing out batters at first base after fielding uncaught line drives that reached them quickly. Outfielders record far fewer assists than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more assists in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Assists are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication about an outfielder's throwing arm than assists by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 1890s through 1920s, including the dead-ball era, due to that period's emphasis on more aggressive baserunning. None of the top 16 players were active after 1934, and only one of the top 50 was active after 1947; none of the top 80 has been active since 1983. Only five of the top 29 single-season totals were recorded after 1894, and only one of the top 157 was recorded after 1936; only four of the top 445 have been recorded since 1963, none of them since 1983. Because game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in career assists as an outfielder with 449, nearly 200 more than any player whose career began after 1920; he is the only outfielder with more than 400 career assists. Starling Marte, who had 92 assists through the 2023 season to place him tied for 357th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a second baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Unlike putouts, exactly one of which is awarded for every defensive out, an out can result in no assists being credited (as in strikeouts, fly outs and line drives), or in assists being credited to multiple players (as in relay throws and rundown plays). In baseball and softball, the second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are almost always right-handed. Only four left-handed throwing players have appeared as second basemen in the major leagues since 1950; one of the four, Gonzalo Márquez, was listed as the second baseman in the starting lineup for two games in 1973, batting in the first inning, but was replaced before his team took the field on defense, and none of the other three players lasted even a complete inning at the position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.\nSecond basemen are most commonly credited with an assist when they field a ground ball and throw the ball either to the first baseman to retire the batter/runner, or to the shortstop covering second base to force out a runner, perhaps beginning a double play. Other common ways in which second basemen gain an assist are by throwing out a runner attempting to reach third base or score, perhaps on a relay throw from the right fielder, rundown plays in which a runner is stranded between bases, throwing out a runner attempting to steal third base on a pickoff throw, and throwing to first or second base after catching a line drive in order to retire a runner before they can tag up. Second basemen and shortstops typically accumulate far more assists than players at other positions due to the frequency of ground balls to the middle infielders; the highest assist total in major league history was recorded by Frankie Frisch in 1927, with all but two of his 643 assists being gained at second base.\nAs strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined; as a result, assist totals for second basemen have likewise declined, and four of the top five career leaders began their careers prior to 1961. Through 2021, only six of the top 24 single-season totals have been recorded since 1938, only 13 of the top 64 since 1966, and only 14 of the top 192 since 1992. Eddie Collins is the all-time leader with 7,630 career assists; Charlie Gehringer (7,068) is the only other second baseman with over 7,000 career assists."

        "text": "John Fletcher is an American former ice hockey goaltender and coach who was an All-American for Clarkson.\nCareer.\nFletcher was an instant hit for Clarkson, taking over the starting role as a freshman. He recorded 4 shutouts and was named ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year. The team in front of him was average at best and finished in the middle of the conference, losing in the first round of the ECAC Tournament, but that didn't stop Fletcher from being drafted by the Vancouver Canucks after the season. Fletcher was just as good the following year and was named an All-American. He backstopped the Golden Knights to an upset win over top-seeded Harvard in the conference semifinals and was named as the top goalie of the tournament.\nAfter new head coach Mark Morris arrived in 1988, Fletcher saw his numbers worsen and his time in goal was reduced. Despite this, Clarkson finished 4th in the conference, their best result to date with Fletcher. Unfortunately, the team couldn't use home ice to its advantage and lost in the first round. Fletcher rebounded as a senior and won 20 games, getting the Golden Knights into the NCAA Tournament for the first time in six years. Clarkson was easily dispatched by Minnesota and Fletcher's college career came to a close.\nAfter graduating, Fletcher played two seasons of professional hockey but he found little success. He played exclusively at the ECHL level and ended up with 5 different teams in that span. He finally began to produce good numbers in his last stop with the Johnstown Chiefs, but it wasn't enough to keep him in the game and he retired in 1992.\nFletcher tried his hand at coaching next, serving as an assistant at several colleges over an 8-year span. In his final stop with Nebraska–Omaha, Fletcher also worked as an HVAC Comfort Advisor. He retired from coaching in 2002 and became a sales manager, working for several companies over the next 15 years. In 2018, Fletcher became a sales director for EyeGuide, a position he holds as of 2021."

        "text": "Kyle Christopher Harrison (born August 12, 2001) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Giants selected Harrison in the third round of the 2020 Major League Baseball draft, and he made his MLB debut with them in 2023.\nEarly life.\nKyle Christopher Harrison was born in San Jose, California, and grew up in Orange County, California, and then from 2009 on in Danville, California. His father is Chris Harrison, and his mother Kim played college field hockey for San Jose State University. \nHis maternal grandfather is former left-handed major league pitcher Skip Guinn, who pitched in 68 games in parts of three seasons for the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros in 1968–71. He has a younger brother Connor “Bear” Harrison.\nIn 2015, Harrison was a member of the Tri-Valley All-Stars, which won the Babe Ruth 13-year-old World Series. Four years later Harrison had the top earned run average (ERA) in the 2019 WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup pitching for gold-medal winning Team USA, as he did not allow a run in 10 innings, while striking out 12 batters. \nHarrison attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a sophomore in 2018 he was 9–1 with a 1.17 ERA, as in 54 innings he had 71 strikeouts and walked 23 batters. He was named East Bay Athletic League Pitcher of the Year, a 2018 MaxPreps National All-American, and Cal-Hi Sports All-State Underclass. As a junior in 2019 he was 10–0 with a 1.26 ERA for the Spartans, with 103 strikeouts in 61 innings, and also played first base. As a senior in 2020 he was 2–0 with an 0.78 ERA and pitched nine innings with 18 strikeouts before the season was ended due to COVID-19. In his high school career, he was 21–1 with a 1.19 ERA in three years, striking out 192 batters in 124 innings, and held batters to a .137 batting average. He had a deceptive low below-three-quarter-slot delivery. By his senior year in high school his fastball touched 94 mph, and he also threw a high-70s slider, a change-up, and a curveball.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe San Francisco Giants selected Harrison in the third round of the 2020 Major League Baseball draft. Harrison signed with the Giants for a signing bonus of $2.5 million rather than play college baseball at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Giants more than tripled their offer from the $710,000 slot value to sign Harrison.\nHarrison made his professional debut in 2021 with the Low-A San Jose Giants of the California League. Over 23 starts, he led the league with a 3.19 ERA and 15 hit batsmen and went 4–3 with 157 strikeouts (2nd in the league), and 14.3 strikeouts per nine innings (second) over innings. He was named the 2021 Low-A West Pitcher of the Year, the CAL Pitcher of the Year, a CAL Post-Season All Star, and an MiLB.com Organization All Star.\nHe was ranked # 3 in the Giants 2022 MLB Prospect Rankings. In 2022 Harrison was an All-Star Futures Game selection. He began the year with the High-A Eugene Emeralds, and in seven starts had 59 strikeouts in 29 innings (striking out half of the 118 batters he faced) and a 1.55 ERA. With the Class AA Richmond Flying Squirrels while almost five years younger than the average player in the league, as he was the youngest player in the history of the franchise and turned 21 in August, he had a 3.11 ERA in 84 innings (18 starts) with 127 strikeouts (6th in the league; as he struck out 36.4% of the batters he faced), for 13.6 strikeouts per 9 innings, and he generated a 41% whiff-and-miss percentage with his fastball. His 186 aggregate strikeouts in 2022 were the second-most of any pitcher in the minor leagues, and he led the minor leagues in both strikeouts per 9 innings (14.8; the highest rate for a pitcher in the minors–minimum 100 innings–in a season dating back to 1960) and whiff percentage (39.8%). \"Baseball America\" selected him as the Giants' 2022 Minor League Player of the Year, and as the best pitching prospect in the Eastern League, and he was again an MiLB.com Organization All Star.\nIn his minor league career through 2022, Harrison was 8–6 with a 2.93 ERA in 48 starts, as in 211.2 innings he struck out 343 batters (14.6 strikeouts per 9 innings).\nBefore the 2023 season he was ranked the #18 prospect in the minor leagues by MLB.com. He started the 2023 season pitching for the Triple–A Sacramento River Cats, where at 21 years of age he was six and a half years younger than the average ballplayer. In 2023 Harrison was again an All-Star Futures Game selection. Before he was called up to the major leagues, he was the Giants' # 1 prospect, and the # 1 left-handed pitching prospect in the minor leagues per MLB.com, and with the River Cats in 20 starts he was 1–3 with a 4.66 ERA with 105 strikeouts (6th in the Pacific Coast League) and 48 walks in 65.2 innings, with 7.1 hits per 9 innings (10th), 14.4 strikeouts per 9 innings (2nd), a 35.6% strikeout percentage, and a 16.3% walk percentage.\nSan Francisco Giants (2023–present).\nHarrison made his major league debut on August 22, 2023, against the Philadelphia Phillies. At 22 years old, having had his birthday ten days prior, Harrison was the youngest pitcher for the San Francisco Giants since Madison Bumgarner in 2009. In 3.1 innings gave up five hits, two runs, hit a batter, and had five strikeouts, as 43 (14 of which were swings and misses) of his 65 pitches were strikes. His fastball reached 97.6 mph; the only other left-handed Giants starter who threw that fast a pitch in the pitch-tracking era (since 2008) was Carlos Rodón. \nOn August 28 at Oracle Park, in a 4–1 win over the Cincinnati Reds, in his second career start, Harrison pitched shutout innings and struck out 11 batters, becoming the youngest pitcher (22 years, 16 days) to do so since Madison Bumgarner (22 years, 8 days) did so on August 9, 2011, when he struck out 10 Pittsburgh Pirates batters. He also became just the second pitcher in Giants history to have double-digit strikeouts in his second career start, the other having been Jeff Tesreau in 1912.\nPitching style.\nHarrison pitches with a low three-quarter release, and has a mid-90s rising four-seam fastball that reaches 98 mph at times, a low-80s slider with a big lateral break (his best swing-and-miss pitch), and a developing mid-80s one-seam changeup."

        "text": "Roy Evans (8 October 1909 – 18 May 1998) was a Welsh professional table tennis player from Cardiff. He served as the president of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) from 1967 to 1987. During his tenure at the ITTF, he successfully campaigned for the addition of table tennis in the Olympic Games. In 1984, the Olympics added table tennis as an event, and the first competition was held during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the former IOC president, awarded him the Olympic Order for his role as an advocate for the sport. Evans was named the \"Honorary Life President\" of the organization in 1987 and was appointed OBE in the 1972 Queen's Birthday Honors list.\nBiography.\nRoy Evans was the son of the first treasurer of Wale's Association of Table Tennis, Morgan \"Mog\" Evans. He was born on 8 October 1909 in Cardiff, United Kingdom, and died at the age of 88 on 18 May 1998.\nCareer.\nEvans played for Wales between 1931 and 1933 and was the honorary general secretary of the country's sport governing body from 1933 to 1939. Between 1951 and 1967, he was honored as the general secretary of the International Federation before he held the office of the ITTF president for 20 years. He was later named Honorary Life President in 1987.\nPersonal life.\nEvans met his future wife Nancy Jackson before a match against England in 1929, when the Welsh men and women players were brought together for a practice in Cardiff. They married in 1933. In the 1938 women's world table tennis ranking, Nancy ranked seventh. In his book \"ColouredPins on a Map\", Evans said that he had been to at least 50 countries for the purpose of promoting table tennis."

The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nThere was both good and bad news for the team to begin the season. Beebe Lake froze early, enabling coach Bawlf to form the team at the beginning of December, but only two regulars were returning. To make matters worse, Benjamin Tilton, who had collected 70% of Cornell goals, had graduated and the new lineup would have to work hard to replace his production. On a positive note, Bubier, who was ineligible for the teal last season, returned to the squad for his senior year. He ended up scoring the team's first goal of the season in what was otherwise an uninspired performance.\nThe lineup was shuffled ahead of the second game and the team responded with a much better performance. The Big Red earned their second shutout against Syracuse in as many games. After a two-goal performance, Bubier was looking like an apt replacement for Tilton. In the team's game against Princeton he opened the scoring and when the teams ended the first period with a 1–1 tie there was hope that the Big Red might be able to win the match. The Tigers, however, had other ideas and scored eight consecutive goals to end the match with a convincing victory.\nOnce the team reformed after the exam break, there were several changed in the lineup. Burnett was brought in to start at right wing while O'Neill made an appearance on defense. Despite the changes, the team worked well together due in part to strenuous practices and they ended regulation with a 1–1 tie. In the second overtime, Barthen scored the go-ahead goal but Williams roared back with three unanswered before time ran out. Cornell wasn't expected to compete with Dartmouth, however, keeping the high-powered Indians to 5 goals was a decent result. Senior netminder Nash was singled out for his play and the team stayed in the game despite using just one substitute for the entire match.\ncontinued shuffling of the lineup didn't work for the next game and Cornell dropped its first ever meeting with St. Lawrence. While the game was close, the Big Red's offense just could not get on track against the Saints. The team's offense remained dormant in their final game, scoring a single goal in another close loss. Cornell would not play as many as seven games in a season again until 1940.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

In aftermath, both schools agreed to work in unison and have the same school colors, the “purples” mascot, and the “H” to symbolize their schools. Louisville Male would later go on to change their mascot, but Bowling Green High School remained the purples.\nThe school has recently started upgrading with a renovation project that began in May 2018 with a groundbreaking. Phase I was completed in 2020. Phase I included the construction of 80% of the classrooms of the current facility, with built. In 2020 the Bowling Green Independent School District Finance Corp. issued $17 million bonds for the second phase of renovations to ensure a source of funding for them. In June 2020 the second phase was to begin. The new building was to be built around the original swimming pool, which was to be demolished in Phase II and replaced with another pool. The former pool was called the \"Dome of Champions\", and it closed on March 15, 2021. In October 2021 the current swimming pool is to open. In 2021 the district proceeded with the fourth phase, and the remainder of the former facility is to be razed. The students and staff expect to be completely in the new building by the Spring of 2022."

        "text": "Gordon Campbell was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand in 2 tests in 1932 against England. Campbell played in the position of hooker. In the process he became the 223rd player to represent New Zealand.\nPlaying career.\nRichmond Rovers junior and senior debut.\nGordon Campbell played for Richmond Rovers as a junior. In 1924 he was a member of their 3rd grade team. In 1925 he had moved into their 2nd grade side who won the championship.\nHe made his senior debut on April 24 in a match against Grafton Athletic at the Auckland Domain. It was reported in the Auckland Star that “Richmond, in Prentice, Stevenson, and Campbell, three of last year’s junior players, have a trio of good young fellows who will further improve on their play”. He ultimately played 12 matches for Richmond and was a part of the Roope Rooster winning team on October 16 when they defeated Devonport United 16–15 in the final. Remarkably after just 6 games he was named as a reserve for Auckland's match against New Zealand on July 31 but he was not required to take the field. Then he was named in the Auckland squad to train for their match with Canterbury on August 28 after hooker Alf Townsend withdrew from the side. However once again he was not needed with Neville St George playing at hooker. On October 30 he did however make his debut representative appearance which was for the Auckland Colts against the B Division representative team. The young Auckland side won by 24 points to 17 at Carlaw Park.\nIn 1927 he only played for Richmond 9 times after being injured early in the season and then his season finished prematurely after he last appeared in their round 11 match on July 30. He scored two tries during the season in what was to be a rare feat in his career. He scored his first try in the senior grade on May 14 against City Rovers in a 15 all draw. His try came after Jim Parkes did well in the lead up to give them a 3–0 lead. Alf Townsend had withdrawn from the City side which meant they were without a recognised hooker and Campbell repeatedly won possession for Richmond from the scrums. Early in the second half however Campbell sustained an injury to his thigh and was carried off and admitted to Auckland Hospital though his condition was reported as “satisfactory”. It was expected that he would be “unable to play for some weeks”. He ultimately only missed their round 3 match against Marist though the Auckland Star stated that Richmond “grievously missed the services of Campbell, a clever hooker, now on the injured list”.\nTransfer to Marist.\nAt the beginning of the 1928 season Campbell transferred to Marist Old Boys. He played 15 matches for them during the year and scored 1 try. Following a round 10 match against Devonport United it was said that he “surprised everyone by beating St. George for the ball” in the scrums. In a match report it was said that Devonport “have to hand it to “Stump” Campbell for blocking them in the scrums, though the referee was decidedly lenient towards him, for he frequently swung across before the ball was ever put in”. After the match he was chosen for a midweek Auckland trial match and played for the Probables side on July 11. His team was defeated 24–14 with Campbell being injured and missing a match for Marist the following weekend. He was injured again in the Roope Rooster semi final win over Devonport on September 22 and was carried off with an ankle injury. He was out for a month but returned to play in the Labour Day tournament final on October 27. Marist defeated Richmond Rovers 12–5.\nIn 1929 Campbell played 21 games for Marist but could not break into the Auckland side. He was chosen in the squad for the game against Northland on July 27 but was not picked to play however he came on as a replacement. He ultimately scored the last try of the match which handed Auckland a 22–19 victory. He was chosen again for the squad for the match with Canterbury but was only listed as an emergency player for their August 24 match. The Marist side could only finish mid table in the championship but their form improved later in the season and Campbell was part of the side which won the Roope Rooster against Ponsonby United on September 21 by 17 points to 9. Then a week later they lifted the Stormont Shield after defeating the same opponents 28-14 before 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. The South Sydney side was touring in mid October, becoming the first ever club side from Australia to do so and the Auckland Rugby League decided to match them against the Marist senior side on consecutive weekends. South Sydney had won the 1929 NSWRFL championship less than a month earlier. Campbell was at hooker for both matches which saw Marist win on October 12 by 10 points to 9, and lose on October 19 by 21 to 5. In the first match it was said that “the visitors gained the ball from the scrums in the early stages, but later on Campbell secured more than his share”.\n1930 was a similar season for Campbell. He played 14 games for Marist and was only picked in the Auckland squad for a match against the New Zealand side which was returning from their tour of Australia. However he was only named in the emergency players for the match and did not take the field.\nNorth Island selection.\n1931 saw Campbell play 14 games for Marist and he scored 2 tries in a match against Richmond on May 2. In a June 6 match against the same opponents he was carried off on a stretcher said to “be badly hurt” and taken to Auckland Hospital though he was released to return home the same day. On August 8 Marist won the championship with a win over Devonport.\nFollowing their championship win Campbell was selected for the North Island side to play against the South Island in their annual inter-island fixture. It was said that he justified his inclusion through consistent performances throughout the season. The match was played on Carlaw Park on August 15 and saw the North Island side run out 52-23 winners. Campbell was reported to have “hooked the ball grandly” in the scrums.\nCampbell was then selected in the Auckland squad to play against Northland but he did not make the match day side. At the same time the Eastern Suburbs side from Sydney was touring Auckland and it was said that “it is a pity Campbell cannot test himself against the Eastern Suburbs hooker, as the Marist forward is in a class by himself” as Marist was not on the itinerary. He was however chosen to play for the combined Marist-Devonport side to play Eastern Suburbs on October 17. The combined side defeated the tourists 14-13 before a crowd of 15,000 at Carlaw Park with Campbell's hooking described as “praiseworthy” as he won a lot of possession.\nNew Zealand selection.\nIn 1932 Campbell made 12 appearances for Marist including a 28-8 Roope Rooster final win over City Rovers. He was unavailable to play in the Stormont Shield final win the week following.\nHis first representative match of the season was for an Auckland XIII against South Auckland on July 16. Auckland won the match by 29 points to 13. The following weekend he was selected in a Probables side to play a Possibles team. A series of trial matches were being played to aid the selectors in choosing the New Zealand team to play them in the test series. His Probable's side won by 37 points to 16. Then on August 6 he played for Auckland against the touring English side. Auckland played well before losing 19–14 at Carlaw Park before a crowd of 15,000. New Zealand had lost the first test a week earlier and it was said that Campbell had been “far more successful getting the ball from the scrums than (E.) St. George [the Newton Rangers hooker] in the test match. England gained possession on 34 occasions and Auckland 29 times”.\nCampbell's display was good enough to gain him selection in the New Zealand team for the second test at Monica Park in Christchurch on August 13. New Zealand went down by 25 points to 14 before a crowd of 6,000. Of the scrums it was said that England “used every ounce of their weight when called upon, and occasionally robbed New Zealand of their advantage of very fast hooking. The scrums were not monopolised by any side. England had the advantage in the first spell, at one time having fourteen to the Blacks’ five, and three had been indecisive. Then the positions changed and New Zealand won about ten in a row. The final figures were England 24, New Zealand 22 and six indecisive”. He had been up against English hooker Les White. England had used the huge weight advantage to push New Zealand back in almost every first half scrum but in the second “Campbell managed to get a fair share of the ball”. Campbell was busy around the field also and he and Amos “were often noted in fast breaks with the ball at toe”. He was then chosen again for the third test at Carlaw Park. The Auckland Star reported that “a solid and fast pack has been chosen. Campbell, the Marist hooker, who by his success in the second match, has proved himself the best rake in New Zealand, should have a better opportunity to prove his worth”. New Zealand produced their best effort of the season but was defeated to a last minute try by 20 points to 18. It was said to be one of the hardest fought games ever seen on Carlaw Park with 14,000 present. Campbell again did well in the scrums and “obtained possession on 38 occasions and White 30 times”.\nReturn to Marist and regular Auckland appearances.\nThe 1933 season again saw Campbell playing for the Marist senior side. He played in 13 matches though Marist did not lift and silver wear during the season. They did however easily beat the touring St George side by 25 points to 11 before 13,000 at Carlaw Park on September 30.\nIt was the first year that he was regularly picked in the Auckland side after only having made 3 appearances in total in the previous 2 seasons. He played for Auckland against Taranaki on June 10 and was said to be far more prominent than usual. Auckland won the match by 32 points to 20. He was injured in a club match against Ponsonby on June 24 and missed 2 matches for Marist and was then unavailable for Auckland for their match with South Auckland.\nHe returned to play for Marist and then was selected for Auckland's match with North Auckland on August 12. Auckland won by 28 to 13. The Auckland Star writer said that “Campbell hooked the ball for Auckland, but there are many who claim that his peculiar method is illegal”. He was chosen again in the Auckland side for their match with the West Coast however he was unable to play due to a leg injury with Len Schultz taking his place though it was said that he intended to play in their next match against Hawke's Bay. He did indeed play against Hawke's Bay with Auckland running out easy 47-17 winners. His final match for Auckland was against South Auckland on September 9. Auckland won by 17 to 5.\nRetirement and transfer to Mount Albert United.\nCampbell had decided to retire at the start of the 1934 season. However he came out of retirement for Marist's round 3 match against City. In early June Campbell was involved with a dispute along with 7 other senior Marist players with the committee. The 8 players refused to play. The players concerned were Campbell, along with Charles Dunne, Des Herring, Wilf Hassan, the 3 Schultz brothers (including Len and Bill), and Claude List. An official statement from the club committee said “that several committee members and some players were dissatisfied on a point of club finance, whether portion of expenditure should apply to senior players alone or be devoted to general club services, including juniors. It was found legally essential to hold the annual meeting over again in order to correct previous unconstitutional procedure. Apparently this caused the eight players mentioned to attempt to embarrass the club by adopting an attitude of passive resistance. Realising it was possible that the players were being misled, the club made every effort to reason with them, and the committee was fortunate to find it had the co-operation of many young players willing and capable of assisting in an emergency”. He retired once more and thanked the club though he later transferred to the Mount Albert United. Mount Albert were in their first ever first grade appearances. Indeed, Campbell was to play in their first ever first grade match in a round 1 Roope Rooster clash with Ponsonby on August 18 at Carlaw Park. Mount Albert lost 19–11. Campbell began playing for them to start the 1935 season but was only listed in one match day side which was their round 1 match against City Rovers. He did however turnout for them again a few times in 1936 helping the side out due to injuries. At the end of the season he retired for the last time.\nCoaching Ponsonby United.\nIn 1938 it was reported that he was to coach the Ponsonby senior side along with former New Zealand star Bill Davidson. Then in 1939 he was named as selector of the top side at Ponsonby.\nNew Zealand RL Old Boys Association.\nIn 1940 Campbell was the chairman of the New Zealand Rugby League Old Boys Association. The following year in 1941 he played for the New Zealand Old Boys team against a South Auckland veterans team at Carlaw Park."

Teams play six matches against their regional pool rivals home and away. The remaining twelve matches are made up by a single round robin, consisting of an even number of six home and six away matches against all the sides from the other pools. There is only one main league table (the conference system used in previous Pro14 years has been dropped). The top eight sides in the table will qualify for the quarter-finals, followed by semi-finals and a grand final, with teams seeded 1 to 4 with home advantage for the lowest seeded side.\nA total of eight sides qualified for the following season's European Rugby Champions Cup, while the remaining eight sides will play in the EPCR Challenge Cup. All points won in the competition contributed to rankings in the regional pools, with the top side in each regional pool automatically qualifying for the European Rugby Champions Cup. The remaining four places went then go to the highest ranked teams in the main table (who haven't already qualified). A similar format was used to determine playoff contenders in the Super Rugby competition. This will see the South African sides in the competition qualifying for a European competition for the first time (subject to finalisation of contract terms), as previous South African participants – the Cheetahs and Southern Kings – were ineligible for European competitions.\nTables.\nURC – Regional Shields Pools Tables.\nThe Regional Shield pools of the regular season are the primary mechanism by which teams qualify for European competition, with the 'Shield winner' of each regional pool guaranteed qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup, ensuring at least one South African, one Welsh and one Irish side qualify for the premier European competition. As Scotland and Italy are sharing a single regional pool, at least one team from those two countries combined is also guaranteed entry, but neither country individually is so guaranteed.\nThe remaining four places will be awarded to those with the four best overall regular season records, regardless of which pool they take part in. As such, it is possible that a team will qualify for the ERCC without reaching the URC play-offs by topping its pool, but finishing ninth or lower overall; conversely, it is also possible that a team could win the entire URC championship from seventh or eighth seed in the overall championship table, but fail to qualify for the ERCC because teams below them topped their respective pools. Since each pool has only four teams, this means in effect that the top 6 in the overall table are guaranteed entry into the Champions Cup, with the final two places dependent on the placement of the two lowest ranked pool shield winners.\nUnited Rugby Championship table.\nThe overall United Rugby Championship table is the central pillar of the regular season, and the mechanism by which the teams qualifying for the Championship play-off bracket are decided. The top eight teams in the table at the end of the regular season, regardless of regional pool, qualify for the play-off quarter-finals, seeded in the order they finished the regular season.\nThe overall table also provides the secondary path to qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup, with the four highest-ranked teams not already qualified as Shield winners gaining qualification.\nPlay-offs.\nBracket.\nThe play-off draw was seeded by final finishing position in the regular season table\nChampionship final.\nThe first United Rugby Championship Final was an all-South African derby, ensuring the first ever South African winner of the tournament, the Bulls having narrowly missed out on winning the transitional Pro14 Rainbow Cup competition. It also marked the first time in the history of the competition that a Grand final play-off match has not included at least one Irish province, a run of 14 finals.\nEnd of Season Awards.\nURC Dream Team.\nThe 2021–22 United Rugby Championship Dream team is:\nAward winners.\nThe 2021–22 URC award winners were:\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps.

        "title": "Syracuse–Virginia lacrosse rivalry",
        "text": "The Syracuse–Virginia lacrosse rivalry is an intercollegiate lacrosse rivalry between the Syracuse Orange and the Virginia Cavaliers. The teams first met in 1938 and have met 42 times. The teams are tied in the all-time series 21–21, but Virginia leads NCAA Tournament play 7–3. This rivalry is considered especially fierce because of its extremely even-matched nature, and its historic tendency to occur in key NCAA Tournament matches. Its intensity has been further heightened in the 21st century due to Syracuse joining Virginia in the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2013, and is now considered one of the most monumental matchups in the sport year after year. Unique to this rivalry in the ACC is that it has its primary roots in lacrosse itself, and isn't a carryover from other sports.\nThese rivals have met in the Final Four or Championship Game of the NCAA Tournament on six occasions, with Virginia winning four. They decided the last NCAA Championship of the 1900s, with Virginia defeating Syracuse, 12–10, in 1999. In their Final Four matches, Virginia defeated Syracuse in 1986, in 1994, and in 2006; while Syracuse defeated Virginia in 1995 and in 2008.\nThis rivalry game has been an annual fixture of the regular season since 1995, nearly two decades before the teams played in the same conference. The exception was 2020 when the game was cancelled due to COVID-19. Their rivalry game then occurred \"twice\" in the 2021 regular season for the first time. Syracuse swept both regular season matchups in that year, including the most lopsided victory in the history of the rivalry. Ironically, it was Virginia that would then go on to win its seventh (and second consecutive) NCAA Championship in that year.\nWith 17 NCAA Championships between them, Syracuse and Virginia rank first and third all-time for NCAA titles in the sport.\nOrange and blue.\nAn odd facet to this rivalry is that the two schools share the exact same school colors: orange and blue. Virginia declared the orange-and-blue combination to be its unique colors—previously unused by any other university's sports teams— in 1888, some 79 years before Syracuse (having faced Virginia twice to that point in lacrosse but never in football or basketball) adopted the same combination in 1967. Between 1890 and 1966, Syracuse previously used orange as its sole school color, complemented only by white, an apparent reference to the Netherlands' House of Orange-Nassau which had originally colonized New York during the Dutch Republic. Virginia and Syracuse are the only Division I men's lacrosse programs to sport these colors; the founder of Auburn University's athletics programs, a Virginia graduate named George Petrie, adopted the orange-and-blue of his \"alma mater\" for that school as well, but Auburn only has a team that only competes in the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association. After Virginia (and Auburn, by extension) but before Syracuse, several other prominent college and professional (but non-lacrosse) teams began also using orange-and-blue as their team colors, including the Florida Gators (1906) and New York Knicks (1946)."

        "text": "Robert Scott (14 February 1872 - 28 March 1947) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe first played for Hawick St. Cuthberts. When the side became defunct in the 1890s Scott then played for Hawick from 1892. He was elected captain of the side for season 1897 to 1898.\nThe \"Dundee Evening Telegraph\" of 22 January 1898 ran this article on the Hawick player when it was announced that he was to play for Scotland:\nMr Robert Scott is the latest addition to the international Rugby ranks from the famous Hawick \"Greens.\" Mr Scott, who captains the Hawick XVs, is a forward of conspicuous ability, and has been one of mainstays of the Club for several seasons. A prominent figure in the South of Scotland matches, his claims for international honours have been somewhat long in being recognised, but there was genuine approbation expressed in Hawick on Saturday evening when it became known that he was included in the Scottish team play Ireland at the 19th prox. His connection with the Hawick Club commenced some six ago, when his first love, St Cuthbert's, broke up, and all along he has proved himself first-rate player, his dribbling and tackling qualities being conspicuous points. During a short stay in the North of England he assisted Manningham, prior that Club's connection with the Northern Union, and here also he made a name for himself. He is 25 years of age, stands about 5 feet 10 inches in height, and weighs almost 13 stones. The other Hawick players who are included the Scottish team, who, however, are not new international fame, are Tom Scott, the flying half-back ; T. M. Scott, the well-known goal kicker, and hero of several internationals ; and Matthew Elliot, or \"Mattha\" as he is popularly designated, the doughty quarter-back.\nHis short stint at Manningham prior to the club switching from rugby union to rugby league would have been before 1895, as that is the year when the Bradford club switched codes to play rugby league.\nHawick St. Cuthberts restarted as a rugby club in the first decade of 1900. It is not likely that Scott returned to play for the side.\nProvincial career.\nHe was capped by South of Scotland District.\nInternational career.\nHe played for Scotland three times between 1898 and 1900.\nBusiness career.\nAfter his rugby union career finished, Scott became a Tweed warehouseman in Islington, London.\nFamily.\nHis parents were Robert Scott (born 1825) and Christina Bisset (1832-1880). He had a sister Elizabeth Scott (born 1869).&lt;/ref&gt;\nHe married Jane Wight (1884-1945) on 16 August 1913 at Woodlands Village in Hawick. Her father Thomas Wight was a joiner. They had two children:- Robert Scott (1915-2000) and Thomas Wight Scott (1916-2004). Both children were born in Islington, London."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career assists as a catcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the defensive team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. The catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to these primary duties, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the catcher is assigned the number 2.\nCatchers are most frequently credited with an assist when they throw out a runner attempting a stolen base, but other situations leading to an assist include bunts where the catcher fields the batted ball near home plate and throws out the batter at first base (or another runner), an uncaught third strike after which the catcher throws out the batter trying to reach first base, rundown plays in which a runner is stranded between bases, and throwing out runners who fail to tag up after a fly ball out. As the frequency of strikeouts has risen in baseball, the number of other fielding outs has declined; the rise of power hitting has also led to a decline in more daring baserunning. Consequently, the list of career assist leaders is dominated by catchers from the dead-ball era prior to 1920, when runners made more aggressive attempts to advance around the bases in risky situations; none of the top 20 players were active after 1931, and only three players since 1950 have reached even 60% of the record. None of the top 65 single-season totals were recorded after 1920, and none of the top 340 were recorded after 1928; only 13 seasons of 100 assists have been recorded since 1945, peaking at 108, far short of the record of 238. As a result, both the career and single-season records are likely among Major League Baseball's most unbreakable records.\nDeacon McGuire is the all-time leader with 1,860 career assists. Only 48 catchers have recorded 1,000 or more career assists."

        "text": "The Jamaica Classic (branded as the Jersey Mike's Jamaica Classic) is an early-season college basketball tournament that takes place in November of each year at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Each year, Jamaica Classic participants play games at campus sites in the United States, some before and some after the Montego Bay games. At Montego Bay, those which host the campus-site games play in the \"Montego Bay Division\" of the Classic, while those which visit the hosts for campus-site games play separately in the \"Rose Hall Division.\" A separate championship is awarded for each division, and a most valuable player is selected in each division.\nGames played at the Montego Bay Convention Centre are televised on the CBS Sports Network.\nHistory.\nThe tournament debuted in 2017 with a 14-team field taking part in campus-site games. Seven of the 14 teams traveled to Montego Bay, where the Montego Bay Division played in a four-team showcase format, with predetermined match-ups scheduled as two doubleheaders. The Rose Hall Division had only three teams, which each played each other once in a three-day round-robin format. This resulted in a tripleheader on the first day at Montego Bay, a lone Rose Hall Division game on the second day, and another tripleheader on the third day.\nIn 2018, eight teams participated. All traveled to Montego Bay, where each division played in a four-team showcase format, with predetermined match-ups scheduled as two doubleheaders over two days. This resulted in two days of competition with four games on each day (one doubleheader for each division), separated by an off day.\nIn 2019, ten teams took part in campus-site games, eight of them NCAA Division I teams. The eight Division I teams traveled to Montego Bay, where play took place using the same format as in 2018.\nThe 2020 edition of the tournament was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to move the first contest date of college basketball for the 2020–2021 season to November 25, 2020. With the pandemic still raging in 2021, the 2021 tournament also was cancelled, and the competition for that year shifted to a temporary tournament, the Jersey Mike's Classic, in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nThe Jamaica Classic resumed competition in 2022 and introduced bracketed tournament play for the first time, with separate brackets for each division. As in 2018 and 2019, four games — two from each division — were played on each of two days, resulting in four games on each of the two days with an off-day in between. The 2022 Classic also reduced the number of campus-site games to four.\nTournaments.\n2022.\nAfter a three-year hiatus, the Jamaica Classic resumed play in 2022, featuring a new format. In addition to campus games, the 2022 event included a tournament featuring two brackets, the first time the Jamaica Classic included bracketed tournament play.\nEight teams took part in the Jamaica Classic. Each participant played a game at a campus site in the United States, either before or after the tournament at Montego Bay. Play at Montego Bay was divided into the Montego Bay Division, a bracketed competition including the four teams which had hosted a campus-site game, and the Rose Hall Division, a separate bracketed competition made up of the four teams which played as the visitor in a campus-site game. The tournament took place over the course of two days, with two Montego Bay Division and two Rose Hall Division games each day and an off day in between. Championship and consolation games in each bracket determined the results in each division.\n2021.\nThe 2021 Jamaica Classic was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, a temporary tournament, the Jersey Mike's Classic, was held and played in the McArthur Center at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Jamaica Classic competition was shifted to the Jersey Mike's Classic for the season, with Ball State, FIU, Green Bay, UMass, UNC Greensboro, and Weber State participating.\n2020.\nThe 2020 Jamaica Classic was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams which committed to participate included UMass, Missouri State, UNC Greensboro, and Wake Forest.\n2019.\nThe 2019 Jamaica Classic had ten participants, eight of them NCAA Division I teams. All campus-site games took place before the Montego Bay tournament, with some teams playing in two campus-site games and others in only one. The eight Division I teams then traveled to Montego Bay, where play followed the format established in 2018 of a four-team showcase-style event in the Montego Bay Division made up of teams which strictly had hosted campus-site games, and a similar four-team showcase-style event in the Rose Hall Division, which consisted of the teams which played against the \"host\" teams as visitors at campus sites.\nRose Hall Division.\nSource\n2018.\nThe 2018 Jamaica Classic had eight participants. Each team played in two campus-site games, some played before and some after the Montego Bay event. Four teams played strictly as hosts in the campus-site games and the other four strictly as visitors.\nAll eight teams traveled to Montego Bay, where the four teams which hosted campus-site games made up the Montego Bay Division and the four which had played as visitors at campus sites made up the Rose Hall Division. Each division played in a two-day showcase-like format with predetermined match-ups on both days of competition. Two Montego Bay Division and two Rose Hall Division games took place on each day, with an off-day in between.\nRose Hall Division.\nSource\n2017.\nFourteen teams — 10 NCAA Division I and four non-Division I teams — participated in the 2017 Jamaica Classic, all of them playing in campus-site games, some of which were held prior to and some after the Montego Bay events.\nSeven of the Division I teams traveled to Montego Bay. Four of them which had hosted campus-site games formed the Montego Bay Division and played in a pair of doubleheaders at Montego Bay, while the other three, each of which had played as the visitor in a campus-site game against one of the \"hosts,\" formed the Rose Hall Division and took part in a round-robin competition at Montego Bay in which each played the other two \"visitors\" once.\nAfter Florida State withdrew from the 2017 Puerto Rico Tip-Off to play in the Jamaica Classic, the Classic's organizers chose the showcase doubleheader format rather than a bracketed tournament between the four \"hosts\" to prevent Florida State and Tulane — already scheduled to meet in the Heritage Insurance Classic on December 10 — from meeting in the Jamaica Classic as well in violation of NCAA scheduling rules.\nRose Hall Division.\nSource"

The Tour began in Brest, France on 26 June, and Stage 12 from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Nîmes occurred on 8 July. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 18 July.\nStage 12.\nThe twelfth stage featured a long course from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Nîmes. The undulating course featured only one categorized climb on the route, the third-category Côte du Belvédère de Tharaux, after , and one intermediate sprint in Uzès with around left. With to go, there was a long uncategorized climb at an average gradient of 3 percent before a downhill run to the finish. Much like on stage 10, there was a threat of crosswinds along the way.\nBefore the stage, Peter Sagan () abandoned the race due to his recurring knee injury. Immediately from the start, the peloton set a furious pace that began to form echelons, with the peloton being split into three groups and all the GC contenders making it into the first group. After around of racing, a 13-man break went away while the groups who were caught out rejoined the main peloton. Most notable of them was the world champion, Julian Alaphilippe (), who made the break for the second consecutive day. The break immediately extended their advantage, and without any teams chasing behind, it became almost certain that the break would go all the way and contest for the stage win. \nWith to go, Nils Politt () attacked with Connor Swift (), but the move was chased down. A few kilometres later, Politt attacked again, this time with Stefan Küng (), Harry Sweeny (), and Imanol Erviti (). The quartet gradually built up their advantage over the rest of their breakaway companions. from the finish, Sweeny launched an acceleration that dropped Küng. With left, Politt was once again on the attack, this time with no response from Erviti and Sweeny. On the downhill run-in to the finish, Politt extended his lead to win his first Tour stage, 31 seconds ahead of Erviti and Sweeny. Küng finished seconds ahead of a group containing most of the other breakaway riders, with Luka Mezgec () winning the sprint for fifth. Stefan Bissegger () was the last of the breakaway members to finish, crossing the line by himself over five minutes behind Politt. About ten minutes after Bissegger, Mark Cavendish () led the peloton home, sprinting for the few remaining points on offer to slightly extend his lead in the points classification. All the GC contenders finished safely in the peloton and the top ten remained unchanged.\nStage 13.\nThe thirteenth stage saw the Tour continue west across southwestern France towards the Pyrenees. With a distance of , it marked the second longest stage of this year's Tour. The undulating route ran roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast, with crosswinds once again being a possibility. The first half of the stage featured both the day's only categorized climb and the intermediate sprint. The fourth-category Côte du Pic Saint-Loup, which is long at an average gradient of 3.7 percent, summitted at into the stage, while the intermediate sprint in Fontès was at . Three uncategorized climbs preceded a flat run-in to the final kilometre, with a slight uphill drag to the finish line.\nThe first few kilometres were marked by several attacks before a trio of riders broke away with around to go. The break included Sean Bennett (), Pierre Latour (), and Omer Goldstein (). After a while, Georg Zimmermann () attempted to bridge from the peloton to the break, albeit unsuccessfully. The trio built a lead of two and a half minutes before the gap came down due to several riders attempting to bridge over to the break. Eventually, took control at the front of the peloton, allowing the break to increase their advantage once again. The trio led by a maximum of four and a half minutes before the peloton started to chase in earnest. At the intermediate sprint, the break took maximum points before Sonny Colbrelli () outsprinted Michael Matthews () for the remaining points on offer as Mark Cavendish () rode closely behind. With to go, the break started attacking each other as Bennett accelerated off the front. Latour and Goldstein managed to bridge up to Bennett before eventually dropping him as well. At around the same time, Philippe Gilbert () and Alex Aranburu () attempted to attack from the peloton but managed to mark the attacks.\nWith to go, a crash on a descent took out several riders at the back of the peloton, with other riders also falling down a small ravine. All of them managed to get back up, but the crash led to the abandonment of Roger Kluge () and the duo of Simon Yates and Lucas Hamilton. Among the survivors, Tim Declercq () and Søren Kragh Andersen () seemed to fare the worst, with both riders finishing over 15 minutes down. from the finish, Latour and Goldstein were brought back by the peloton, prompting an attack from Quentin Pacher () a few moments later. Pacher was allowed an advantage of a minute and a half while Jan Bakelants () also attacked from the peloton. Bakelants was eventually reeled in with to go while Pacher was brought back with left to the finish. Shortly afterwards, several teams attempted to split the peloton into echelons, but the winds were not strong enough to cause such splits. The sprinters' teams soon began to go to the front to prepare for a bunch sprint. In a chaotic sprint to the line, one of Cavendish's lead-out men, Davide Ballerini, managed to get a small gap after Michael Mørkøv briefly lost his wheel. Iván García Cortina () soon bridged over to Ballerini with Mørkøv, Cavendish, and Jasper Philipsen () on his wheel. Mørkøv successfully led out Cavendish for the win, his fourth of the race. Mørkøv managed to hold on to second place on the stage with Philipsen finishing in third. With his win, Cavendish equalled Eddy Merckx's record for the most number of Tour stage wins with 34. He also increased his lead in the points classification to 101 over Matthews. All the GC contenders finished safely in the main peloton, leaving the top ten unchanged.\nStage 14.\nThe fourteenth stage took the riders from Carcassonne to Quillan, making its debut as a Tour stage finish, with a terrain that was expected to suit a breakaway. The first few kilometres were on a false flat section before the riders tackled the third-category , a climb with an average gradient of 5.3 percent.

On the climb's steepest section, Richard Carapaz () attacked but he was marked by the other contenders. Carapaz, Jonas Vingegaard (), Rigoberto Urán (), and Ben O'Connor () launched more attacks but Tadej Pogačar () and the other contenders were able to follow each time. O'Connor and Alexey Lutsenko () were distanced near the top of the Beixalis but O'Connor made it back on the descent. The GC group finished almost five minutes down on Kuss while Lutsenko ended up finishing 29 seconds further in arrears. Martin eventually lost almost four minutes while Cattaneo lost more than five minutes.\nIn the GC, Pogačar retained the \"maillot jaune\" with a lead of 5' 18\" over Urán, who moved back up to second place.

Pogačar made another attack a few seconds later and only Carapaz, Vingegaard, and Urán could follow him. A few moments later, Urán was dropped and would continue to lose time until the finish. Towards the top, Pogačar and Vingegaard worked together to increase their gap while Carapaz continued to sit on their wheels. From the first chase group, which included Urán, O'Connor, and Wilco Kelderman (), David Gaudu () attempted to bridge to the front group but he would not get close to the trio. With to go, Carapaz surged, dropping Vingegaard while Pogačar immediately followed the move. Vingegaard slowly paced himself back, setting up a three-man sprint for the stage win.

The final few kilometres of the course featured a false flat towards the finish line in Saint-Émilion.\nAs is customary for an individual time trial, the riders set off in reverse order of their GC places. As a result, Tim Declercq () was the first rider off the start ramp. The first riders to set fast times were Mikkel Bjerg () and Stefan Bissegger (). Bjerg set a time of 36' 45\", putting him in the hot seat, but Bissegger set faster times at both intermediate time checks by slim margins. Bissegger eventually beat Bjerg's time by eight seconds. He would stay in the hot seat before Kasper Asgreen () began to threaten Bissegger's time. Asgreen was six seconds up at the first time check before extending his lead to 23 seconds at the second time check. He maintained his advantage to the finish, setting a time of 36' 14\" and becoming the first rider to average on the day.

Küng started out fast, beating Asgreen's time by 10 seconds at the first time check. He started to slow by the second time check as his advantage was down to 0.25 seconds. Küng eventually had to settle for a time of 36' 31\", 17 seconds slower than Asgreen. Asgreen's time stood for a long time until Wout van Aert () started his ride. He set the fastest times at both intermediate time checks before setting a time of 35' 53\", the only time on the day under 36 minutes. His time stood for the rest of the day as he won his second stage of this year's Tour.\nThe focus soon shifted to the top ten riders as there were several spots still up for grabs. Pello Bilbao (), sitting in ninth on GC, was only 1' 02\" behind Guillaume Martin () and was expected to overhaul the Frenchman.

The peloton kept the break under control, not letting them get a lead of more than 30 seconds. Heading into the penultimate lap, two riders from , Cyril Gautier and Franck Bonnamour, attempted to bridge up to the trio but the peloton shut down the move. The front trio was eventually caught with around remaining, just inside the final lap, as the sprinters' teams set their riders up for the final sprint. Towards the finish line, Mike Teunissen () managed to lead out his teammate, Wout van Aert, who started his sprint with around to go. Jasper Philipsen () tried to come around him while Cavendish was boxed in just behind van Aert. Van Aert held both riders off to win the sprint, his second consecutive win and third win in this year's race, while Philipsen and Cavendish finished second and third, respectively. Van Aert added a sprint win to his mountain stage win on stage 11 and his time trial win the previous day. Tadej Pogačar () finished safely in the bunch to confirm his second consecutive Tour title.

Contested over 90 laps on the road course, it was the 23rd race of the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series season.\nReport.\nBackground.\nWatkins Glen International (nicknamed \"The Glen\") is an automobile race track located in Watkins Glen, New York at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series.\nInitially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the \"Inner Loop\" was installed in 1992 after J.D. McDuffie's fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event.\nThe circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers. The facility is currently owned by International Speedway Corporation.\nQualifying.\nBrad Keselowski was awarded the pole for the race as determined by competition-based formula.\nRace.\nBrad Keselowski was awarded the pole. Keselowski spun early while leading as teammate Joey Logano won the first stage. Martin Truex Jr. would win the second stage and led the most laps. Keselowski returned to the lead, but spun again and collected Logano, causing small damage to both cars. Kyle Larson made contact with Christopher Bell, sending him spinning. Larson then took the lead from Truex and held off teammate Chase Elliott for his fifth win and second road win of the season.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 20\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 20\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 50\nLarson's victory put him in a tie with Hamlin for the regular-season points lead.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nNBC Sports covered the race on the television side as part of a Radio style Broadcast for the race. Rick Allen and Steve Letarte called the race from the broadcast booth. MRN broadcaster Mike Bagley called the race from the Esses, Dale Earnhardt Jr. had the call from Turn 5, and Jeff Burton had the call from a platform located off Turn 10 that covers Turns 6–7. Parker Kligerman and Dillon Welch handled the pit road duties from pit lane.\nRadio.\nMotor Racing Network had the radio call for the race, which was simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Alex Hayden and Jeff Striegle covered the action when the field raced down the front straightaway. Dave Moody called the race when the field raced thru the esses.

The team alternated short winning and losing streaks and were only one more than 3 away from an even record. Despite this consistent mediocrity, ASU had put themselves, partly due to the difficulty of their schedule, into a potential NCAA tournament appearance by mid-January.\nThe Sun Devils' offense led the way with three players averaging more than a point per game. Freshman Josh Doan, son of famed Arizona Coyotes captain Shane Doan, teamed with sophomore Matthew Kopperud and graduate transfer Colin Theisen to form one of the top offensive lines in the country. Unfortunately, the team's defense wasn't nearly as strong; Arizona State was one of the worst teams in the nation in terms of goals allowed and it was all the offense could do on some nights to keep them in games.\nWhen the Sun Devils met Minnesota State in late-January, Arizona State had a narrow path to a tournament bid if they could earn a split with the #1 team. ASU scored 5 goals in the two games, which was more than most could claim, but they couldn't stop the Mavericks' offense and lost both contests. Their very slim chances were ended the following week when Alaska came to town and swept the weekend slate.

        "text": "The 2021–22 Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey season was the 66th season of play for the program. The team represented Bemidji State University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the first season in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). The Beavers were coached by Tom Serratore, in his 21st season, and played their home games at Sanford Center.\nSeason.\nBemidji State joined with six other members of the WCHA to restart the CCHA for the 2021–22 season. The Beavers began the year with a difficult string of games, going 1–3 against non-conference teams that would both make the tournament. While the losses put them near the bottom of the standings, BSU was able to stay in the polls and keep their NCAA hopes alive with a sweep of Northern Michigan. The Beaves spent November hovering around 20th in the polls but a couple of losses knocked them out for good come December.\nThe chief problem for Bemidji State during the first half of their season was inconsistent goaltending. Tom Serratore had used all three of his netminders at times but none performed at a high level. Eventually the team went with freshman Mattias Sholl as the primary starter but the young goalie still was getting used to the college game.\nAfter losing four consecutive game to ranked teams in December, Bemidji State had dropped down to .500 but, because of the poor record against good teams (2-8 against eventual tournament teams), the Beavers had very little to buoy themselves in the standings. Both the offense and defense played well for a three game stretch, however, that ended rather abruptly; BSU went 1-8 over a month-long stretch, only once score more than 2 goals (the solitary win) and surrendering 5 goals in five separate games. The losing streak made it impossible for the Beavers to make the tournament without a conference championship and put them in jeopardy of having to play on the road in the quarterfinals. The only thing that arrested their free-fall was a date with the worst team that season, St. Thomas, who was playing its first season at the Division I level.\nThe uninspired play to end their year did not bode well for Bemidji State in the conference tournament. Despite their play of late, the team recovered in the postseason and the defense led them to a pair of victories over Bowling Green. The conference semifinal could hardly have gone better for the Beavers as the offense finally reappeared during the third period, potting 3 goals in 5 minutes to lead them to a stunning upset of Michigan Tech.\nBemidji State was now just one win shy of making the tournament but standing in their way was the best team in the country, Minnesota State. Despite the pressure from the Mavericks, Sholl played probably his best game of the season and held MSU off of the scoresheet for the first half of the game. The Beavers took a lead half way through the second but lost it on a power play goal just before the end of the period. After neither team was able to score in the third, Bemidji State found themselves in the improbable position of needing just one goal to continue their year. Unfortunately, just three minutes into overtime, Minnesota State scored and ended the Beaver's run. 50 minutes later, after the Mavericks had been awarded the trophy and both teams had returned to their locker rooms, the game-winning goal was called off after additional replay angles revealed that the puck had not crossed the goal-line between the pipes but instead gone under the goal cage. Bemidji State's season was given new life and, after a warm-up period for both teams, the game was resumed. Unfortunately, like a boxer on their last legs, the Beaver's comeback only lasted until the next shot. Two minutes after resuming play, the Mavericks scored their second overtime goal, this time with no controversy, and the Beavers were knocked out.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nThe weather wasn't kind at the start of the season, but it was more accommodating than it had been the year before. Cornell was able to get some practice in before Christmas but the team had some unwelcome news at the beginning of their season. Two starters from '24 who were expected to be on the team were ineligible. Burnett and Kidd, key players in Cornell's offense, wouldn't be able to play this season and coach Bawlf would have to scramble to find their replacements. The lake froze well and the first game with Boston University was played on the 10th. The new lineup didn't have enough practice time together and visitors displayed much better cohesion in their 7–2 win.\nAn increase in practice time followed and the team responded with a win over MAC the following week. The team's defense was far sturdier and held the Aggies without much of a chance to score for the first two periods. As had happened during the first game, Tilton remained at center for the entire contest while several players were rotated through both wing positions. The team played their next match a week later but were stymied by a stingy MIT squad, managing just 1 goal in a biting wind.\nThe team wen dormant for several weeks during the exam period and their restart was delayed even further when the match against Clarkson was cancelled due to poor ice conditions. The next team was against a familiar opponent in Princeton and there was hope that the Big red could take advantage of a weakened Tiger squad. However, Cornell was hampered by a lack of practice and the team was soundly defeated. Moving Tilton back to defense provided a boon to the blue line but the team was unable to stop the Princeton offense from seemingly scoring at will. The final game of the year came against Hamilton and the team was held scoreless by their opponents.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The men's national basketball team of Slovenia competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The team was captained by Edo Murić, while the Dallas Mavericks star Luka Dončić became the third best scorer and the best assist provider of the tournament; he was also included in the FIBA All-Star team of the tournament. This was the first appearance of Slovenia's basketball team at the Olympics.\nSlovenia went undefeated in the group stage with three victories out of three games. In the quarter-finals, they eliminated Germany, before being stopped by France in the semi-finals in a close match, decided in the last seconds. In the bronze medal match, Slovenia lost to Australia, finishing the tournament in fourth place.\nQualification.\nSlovenia qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics after competing in the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments, winning the tournament in Kaunas. They won all games in the Group B, defeating Poland and Angola. Klemen Prepelič and Luka Dončić led Slovenia to a 112–77 victory over Poland, scoring 18 and 17 points, respectively. In the Final round, they defeated Venezuela 98–70 in the semi-final, and were set to play against Lithuania in the final. Dončić went close to triple-double against Venezuela, scoring 23 points, 13 assists, and 9 rebounds. Slovenia defeated Lithuania 96–85 in Kaunas, led by Dončić (31 points, 11 rebounds, 13 assists), who with his triple-double sent Slovenia to their first Olympic appearance. On the other hand, Lithuania missed their first Olympics since the independence in 1990. Dončić was presented with the MVP award by Arvydas Sabonis after the win. \nOlympic play.\nPreliminary round.\nSlovenia competed in Group C in the opening round. Teams played in a round-robin format with the top three teams advancing to the quarter-finals. Slovenia ended group play with 3–0, and finished as the group's top seed.\nArgentina.\nIn the opening game, Slovenia beat Argentina 118–100, with strong performances by Luka Dončić (48 points, 11 rebounds, 5 assists), Klemen Prepelič (22 points), and Mike Tobey (11 points and 14 rebounds). With his 48 points in this game, Dončić tied with Eddie Palubinskas for the second highest points scored in a match in the history of the Olympics.\nJapan.\nIn the next game, Slovenia defeated host Japan 116–81. Dončić had another good performance, scoring 25 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists in 26 minutes, while Zoran Dragić scored 24 points. After the game, Japan coach Julio Lamas remarked: \"They played better than us, all the game. They are a very good team, very complete team with one amazing player.\"\nSpain.\nAfter winning their first two games in the competition, Slovenia faced Spain, the reigning world champions, and defeated them 95–87. In the game, Dončić suffered a box-and-one defense employed by Spain to curtail him. Prepelič entered the match late in the first quarter and, like Dončić, received box-and-one defense from Sergio Llull while Dončić was on the bench. Dončić was one point too short of getting triple double, scoring 14 points, 14 rebounds, and 9 assists. Tobey, who was Slovenia's top performer of the game and was named player of the day by FIBA, recorded a double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds, while Prepelič (15 points) was the hero of the game, scoring the crucial three-pointer that put Slovenia ahead 86–85 two and a half minutes before the end. A minute and a half before the end he intercepted a ball and sent Tobey an alley-hoop which he dunked to close the game. Vlatko Čančar also scored 22 points.\nThe win gave Slovenia the group's top seed.\nKnockout round.\nQuarterfinal – Germany.\nSlovenia won their quarter-final, defeating Germany 94–70. Dončić again dominated the court, but Tobey, Prepelič, Čančar and Dragić were also praised for their performances. Slovenia was somewhat imprecise in the first half. They won the first quarter but lost the second, and Germany even surpassed them 32–31, with both Dončić and Prepelič erring. \nPrepelič and Dončić gave the final blow to Germany, putting an advantage of 19 points in the middle of the fourth quarter. Prepelič scored one three-pointer, then attempted two more times from behind the line and scored both times.\nDragić led all scorers with 27 points. He closed the first half with a three-pointer and opened the second with another one, while Tobey recorded another double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds. Dončić again went near a triple double, scoring 20 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists.\nSemifinal – France.\nSlovenia lost the dramatic semi-final against France by one point, 90–89. The match seemed over for Slovenia when Jaka Blažič missed a three point jumper and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot made it 90–85 for the French, with less than a minute left to play. However, Prepelič, who in a few seconds managed to score four points, brought Slovenia to just one point of France. Next, Nando de Colo missed a layup and Slovenia had the match point. Dončić renounced to shoot, and turned the clutch shoot over to Prepelič, who attempted a layup but was stopped by a block by six-inch taller Nicolas Batum. After the game, Rudy Gobert stated that Batum's game-saving play was \"one of the best blocks he had ever seen.\" Dončić scored 16 points (and also went triple double), while Tobey and Prepelič scored 23 and 17 points, respectively.\nBronze medal game – Australia.\nSlovenia played the bronze medal game against Australia, which they lost 107–93 to the Boomers. Australia got off early, taking a 9–2 lead after three minutes and a half. Slovenia initially passed Australia 15–13 with a three-pointer by Prepelič. However, from a score of 17–13, Australia passed them again with a three-pointer by Chris Goulding and a jumper by Patty Mills, who scored 26 points in the first half. In the third quarter, Prepelič brought Slovenia within 60–66 with less than four minutes left in the period, converting a four-point play. He and Dončić scored again, but Mills and Joe Ingles responded, with the score now at 64–75.\nSlovenia didn't give up, and a free throw and a layup by Blažič and five points from Prepelič brought them five points of the Boomers. Dončić, who finished with 22 points, 8 rebounds, and 7 assists, endeavored to bring Slovenia back into the game. Prepelič brought the score to 75–81 with a layup just before Australia's time-out. He then scored another three-pointer, and Dončić a layup, for a score of 80–83. However, Australia managed to take ten points of advantage again. Subsequently, Čančar made an offensive foul on Dante Exum, who then scored a three point jumper. Dončić scored a three-pointer, but Mills went on to reach his 40th point and Ingles scored a three-pointer. Slovenia then failed some attempts to keep the game alive, and Australia went over 100 points, eventually winning the game. Prepelič scored 18 points and 2 assists and approached a double-double with 7 rebounds. He was Slovenia's top performer of the game.\nStatistics.\nSource:"

The Badgers were still a powerful team in Thomas' first season, winning the WCHA Tournament and returning to the national championship game, only to conference rival North Dakota. Thomas had played well that season and was invited to participate at the 1982 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Team USA finished in 6th, a typical result for the team. The next season began shaping up even better for Thomas. Wisconsin looked ready to compete for a championship again while he spent time as both a forward and defenseman. Thomas played in his second WJC and, though he wasn't able to help them finish in the medals, Thomas led the US National team in scoring. His stellar play earned him an invite to the National Team for the upcoming World Championships and he remained with the national team for the remainder of the year. Thomas helped the US win pool-B with an undefeated record and a promotion to the top bracket for the subsequent world championship.\nWith Wisconsin having won a National Championship in his absence, Thomas remained with Team USA for the next season as they prepared for the 1984 Winter Olympics. He played through the entire season with the program and was even included on the Olympic roster, but he didn't play in any of the games. After a disappointing 7th-place finish, Thomas left the national team and returned to Wisconsin. The team had fallen off the pace after making three consecutive championship games and was now playing just well enough to not make tournament appearances. Upon his return, Thomas produced a monster offensive season, leading the team with 50 assists and finishing second at 63 points. He led all defensemen in the nation in scoring and was named an All-American. After Wisconsin was eliminated from the playoffs, he rejoined the US national team one final time at the World Championships, helping the team to a 4th-place finish.\nIn his senior season, Thomas's numbers slipped a bit but he was still able to help Wisconsin to a 27-win season. The team, however, was swept in the conference semifinals and missed out on another NCAA tournament. Immediately after the season was over, Thomas began his professional career and played the rest of the season with the Indianapolis Checkers. Despite posting good numbers, he ended up playing the next season in Finland. He joined reigning league champion Tappara and helped the club repeat with their 6th championship.\nHe was back in North America the following season but ended up playing just 10 games for the Baltimore Skipjacks. He headed back to Europe in 1988 and played a year with Diables Noirs de Tours. After sitting out for a few seasons, Thomas ended his playing career with the Nijmegen Tigers in 1992."

        "text": "The 1923–24 Penn Quakers men's ice hockey season was the 12th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPenn's season began normally, with a slew of new players trying out for the squad. Despite much more practice time entering this season than the year before, coach Powers wasn't too optimistic about the team's first game and results bore that out. a 1–4 loss to began didn't harm the team too much as it was against an amateur team and wouldn't impair their collegiate ranking. After some lineup changes, the Quakers travelled up to West Point and won their first game despite very poor ice conditions. After a match with Lafayette was canceled, the spot was filled by a team composed of Princeton alumni who resided in and around Philadelphia. The game proved to be an even match and ended in a tie., which led the Quakers into their normal intercollegiate season with a .500 record.\nThe first big test for the team came against Yale and the Quakers were completely outmatched. Yale had several advantages in the game, including playing their 14th game of the season, but the biggest was how the Bulldogs used the closeness of the boards to the net and shot pucks off of the back wall and had them rebound out in front of the goal. Exams caused the team's next game to be played in early February and the time off didn't appear to help the squad. The next game, a few days later, also ended in a loss but the team nearly managed to overcome an early deficit and lead to some hope for the near future. The rematch with Hamilton happened at the end of the month and, despite Warner returning from a shoulder injury, the Quakers could only earn a tie with the Continentals. On a positive note, the game did attract 2,000 spectators so even in the midst of a poor season the team could still command a good-sized crowd.\nThe Quakers' season ended after a 1–5 loss to Dartmouth but worse news was soon to come. Due to financial constraints, the team was discontinued after the 1924 season and wouldn't play again for four years.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Founded in 1999, JTCC trains junior, collegiate and professional tennis players. \nThe center hosts United States Tennis Association (USTA) and International Tennis Federation (ITF) Junior World Tour events, and serves as the training center for the University of Maryland's women's tennis team. \nThe center has 17 outdoor courts and 15 indoor courts, including hardcourts, Har-Tru courts, and red clay courts. \nHistory.\nJTCC was founded in 1999 by investment banker Ken Brody. The school was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization meant to serve Washington, D.C., and its Maryland suburbs of Montgomery County and Prince George’s County. Rather than recruiting players from around the country and world, like some tennis academies, the center aims to discover and harvest the best tennis talent from the Washington metropolitan area, JTCC officials said in 2014. \nJTCC began operating with 40 recruited junior tennis players from the Mid-Atlantic region.\nFrom 1999 to 2010, future World No. 10 Frances Tiafoe often stayed at the center five nights a week, sleeping in a back room with his brother and his father, the center's head of maintenance. Tiafoe attended school and was coached by the staff at the center.\nBy 2004, JTCC had demonstrated enough success in junior tennis to earn a designation as a USTA Regional Training Center.\nJTCC reached a multi-year agreement with Fila in 2013. As a result of this agreement, Fila has a shop at JTCC and top JTCC players are provided with Fila apparel for junior tournaments.\nIn 2013 and 2018, JTCC received the USTA's USA Developmental Program of the Year Award for training youth tennis players.\nTournaments held.\nThe center has hosted various USTA regional tournaments. It hosts the Wayne K. Curry Prince George’s County International Junior Tennis Championships, an ITF Junior World Tour Grade 1 event. The tournament has drawn numerous future professional tennis players including Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Denis Shapovalov, Reilly Opelka, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Frances Tiafoe, Casper Ruud, Tommy Paul, Sebastian Korda, Coco Gauff, Sofia Kenin and Claire Liu.\nJTCC also hosts the ITA Bedford Cup Mid-Atlantic Championships, which is an NCAA Division I women's tennis tournament that draws teams from around the country. Participating schools have included the University of Maryland, University of Delaware, Georgetown University, James Madison University and George Washington University.\nPrograms.\nCommunity outreach.\nSince 2009, JTCC has run the GEICO Game On! program, which brings JTCC coaches to inner-city schools and recreation centers to teach at-risk children how to play tennis.\nHigh Performance program.\nThe High Performance program has four components: Full Time, Champs I, Champs II, and Junior Champs. Each group has players between ages 6 and 18, and trains for collegiate recruitment.\nSchool.\nJTCC uses the Laurel Springs School as its distance schooling program. Players in the Full Time High Performance program usually are enrolled in the program to help maximize training time. The school claims that \"every student who has graduated from JTCC’s Champions program has earned a scholarship to a Division I program or a facilitated acceptance at a Division III or Ivy League college or university and/or have pursued careers in professional tennis.\" There are two teachers that teach in-person and full-time at JTCC.\nThe program's graduates have gone on to attend all the Ivy League colleges, Stanford, Chicago, Virginia, UCLA, Illinois, North Carolina, Maryland, Penn State, Michigan, Texas, Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, Emory, Rice, Duke, Georgetown, George Washington, Notre Dame, Wake Forest and many other colleges and universities.\nNotable alumni.\nJTCC has trained numerous NCAA college tennis players, including NCAA Division I, II, and III champions and All-American players. \nThe center has also trained professional tennis players during professional events, including the US Open Series' Washington Open, the ATP 500, and WTA International tournament at the nearby William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center. "

        "text": "The 1941–42 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 35th season of play for the program. The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 20th season.\nSeason.\nCornell's season began with the 4th annual Lake Placid Invitational Tournament. The team was fairly young, having six sophomores on the squad, but were still able to compete in the 8-team championship. Cornell dominated Middlebury in the first match but 2-time defending champion Colgate continued their undefeated tournament run with a 4–1 victory in the semifinal. Cornell's offense recovered in the third place match, firing 8 more goals into the net to defeat new entry New Hampshire to give themselves their best finish in three years. Stan Roberts led the team with 6 goals in the series.\nAfter returning to campus, the team once again found themselves at the mercy of the weather. The conditions on Beebe Lake were poor but the Big Red soldiered on, trying to get as much practice in before their rematch with Colgate. Fortunately, the temperature dropped and the ice solidified enough for the first game to be played at Ithaca in two years. The home ice advantage allowed Cornell to build a 5–2 lead by the later half of the second period. However, after the Big Red found themselves playing 4 on 6, the Raiders scored twice to end the middle frame down by just one goal and then put up three more unanswered in the third to win the match.\nCornell would have to wait until after semester exams for their next game. By the time they were ready to go, the weather forced the cancellation of a match against Penn State on February 6. Cornell played a match in the middle of the following week against a weak Union squad and then headed to West Point for their final game of the season. The game turned into a barn-burner after Army led 2–1 after 20 minutes. Cornell evened the score early in the second and the game see-sawed between the two so that both teams had 4 on the board at the start of the third. From there on, Cornell was able to outpace the Cadets and win their 4th game of the season, giving the Big Red a winning record for the first time in eleven years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\"| \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Michael Smith (born January 17, 1971) is a Canadian retired ice hockey defenseman who was an All-American for Lake Superior State.\nCareer.\nSmith was recruited to Lake Superior State in 1989 and played his freshman season under Frank Anzalone. Smith was an unheralded but effective player his first season, helping the Lakers tie the program record with 33 wins. The following season, with Anzalone leaving to coach in the professional ranks, Smith saw his ice time and production blossom under former assistant Jeff Jackson. Smith more than doubled his career totals and got LSSU to set a new program record with 36 wins to go with the Lakers' first conference championship. Lake State received the top western seed, however, Clarkson arrived ready to play in the 1991 national quarterfinals and took two of three games to knock out the tournament favorites. Despite the bad end, Smith was selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the 12th round of the NHL Draft.\nFor his junior season, Smith's numbers declined slightly but that didn't stop the Lakers from having another dominant campaign. LSSU finished second in the CCHA but used their stellar defense to capture a second conference title and head back to the NCAA tournament. This time the team was a 3-seed and missed out on a bye, but the Lakers persevered and ran roughshod over their opponents in the first two rounds. They slowed down a bit in the national semifinal, but were still able to drop Michigan State 4–2. The championship game against Wisconsin turned into a bit of a debacle due to questionable penalty calls but the Lakers were the ones who were ahead when the dust settled. Smith scored lake Superior's third goal of the game to give his team its first lead and helped shut down the Badger's offense in the later half of the game to give LSSU its second national championship.\nSmith was named an alternate captain for his senior season and the Lakers were again one of the best teams in the country. Lake State won its third consecutive conference title while Smith was named an All-American. LSSU received the top western seed once more but this time the team used it to their advantage. Lake State marched all the way to the championship game and were faced with one of the most dominant teams in NCAA history, 1993 Maine. The Black Bears got off to a quick start with two goals before the first period was half over but Lake Superior's defense tightened up afterwards and allowed their offense to begin whittling down Maine's advantage. The Lakers scored 4 consecutive goals in just over 20 minutes to take a 2-goal lead into the third. Unfortunately for Smith, his team was facing down the nation's top offense, led by future Hall of Famer Paul Kariya, and Maine was able to get three goals in quick succession to snatch victory away from Lake Superior. With his college career now over, Smith finished out the year with a pair of games for the Rochester Americans.\nBuffalo decided not to sign Smith to a rookie contract so he ended up joining his former coach, Frank Anzalone, with the Roanoke Express. Smith played the bulk of the next 5 seasons for Roanoke, leaving several times to play AAA hockey with several teams but he could never stick at the top level of the minor leagues. When Anzalone became the first head coach for the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1998, Smith decided to call it a career and retired as a player."

The tournament was played in Vantaa, Finland, between 26 September and 3 October 2021. China were the defending champions. They successfully defended their title, lifting the trophy for a record-extending 12th time.\nHost city selection.\nOriginally the Badminton World Federation awarded Suzhou, China to host the tournament back in November 2018, but due to the strict restrictions from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it was too hard to conduct tournaments in China in 2021. Thus, on 29 June 2021 BWF announced that Vantaa, Finland would be the new host to stage this tournament. \nCompetition format.\nUnlike previous format of Sudirman Cup, only 16 teams will compete in the competition. Teams will be drawn into four groups of four teams. The competition still starts with a group stage followed by a knockout stage.\nQualifying.\nOriginally, the qualifying process to qualify was through each continental (Asia, Europe, Pan America, Africa, and Oceania) mixed team championships which were planned to take place around February 2021. However, only the European Mixed Team Championships was able to take place due to travel and border restrictions arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting the other planned continental team championships. Therefore, teams from Asia, Pan America, Oceania, and Africa qualified based on the World Rankings.\nWith the move of host city from Suzhou to Vantaa, it was decided to retain the same qualifying teams as originally qualified in February for the Suzhou hosted tournament which means the quota place for the hosts is temporarily waived. However, if a team withdrew from the competition, the host (Finland) will be invited to participate first.\nFrance and Australia, later on, withdrew from the competition, thus Finland was awarded a quota place as the host. New Zealand was originally to take the place but also declined, in the end, Tahiti was awarded the quota place for Oceania due to their performance at the 2019 Pacific Games. \nTiebreakers.\nThe rankings of teams in each group were determined per BWF Statutes Section 5.1, Article 16.3: \nGroup stage.\nAll times are Eastern European Summer Time ()"

        "text": "The 1927–28 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 23rd season of play for the program. The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nA common but unwelcome occurrence, Cornell's season began late due to a lack of ice. The team didn't get on their skates until January and, as a result, the first home game wasn't scheduled until the 14th. Warm weather continued to plague the team through the first half of the month and eventually the first game against Syracuse had to be cancelled. The situation got so bad for the Big Red that they were forced to hold practices inside, without ice. All of the team's early misfortune resulted in a terrible game for Cornell to start the season. The Big Red lost a road game to Princeton 1–14, setting a program worst for the most goals allowed and the largest margin of defeat. The result could hardly be surprising as Princeton was playing on their home rink, and was competing in their eighth game of the season.\nAfter the drubbing, Cornell returned home to find the weather still wasn't up to the take to freeze Beebe Lake. There were fears that their next game would have to be cancelled as well but the team was finally able to play at home on the 28th. The Big Red played much better than they had in the first match but their conditioning was still lacking and the team faded in the later half of the game. The following game took place two weeks later but the warm weather was still a problem. Initially the game was delayed and then cancelled but, owing to a small patch of ice on the northwest section of the lake, a temporary rink was built and the game took place on the 10th. The result was more indicative of Cornell's lack of practice than any superiority by Williams, but the Big Red lost their third game out of three matches. Team captain Taylor was forced to sit out the game due to taking a puck in the eye in one of the few practice sessions before the match.\nAnother game with Syracuse, which was to be held on February 18, ended up being nixed due to weather conditions. Union, owing to having the same rink arrangement as Cornell, was in much the same shape as the Ithacans. The result was a win for the Big Red in front of a very small crowd. The match was supposed to have been the team's final game of the season, however, the weather suddenly turned cold and the ice was good enough for one more game to be tacked onto the end of the season. The game was reported as being a 'post season' match, which it was in a literal sense as it took place after the team's schedule had concluded. Once again, Cornell faced a squad as equally impacted by weather conditions as they were and the Big Red came out on top. MacPherson scored the only goal of the game and Cornell was able to finish the season with a respectable record in spite of all their troubles.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

This marks the only time the tournament has been held in Edmonton in the 59 years it’s been contested, and the fifth time in Alberta (the other four were in Calgary).

The Great Danes represent University at Albany, SUNY in the NCAA's America East Conference.\nAlbany began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1910. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Albany's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 2021 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2020–21 season and the culmination of the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs. The series was between the Montreal Canadiens and the defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning. The Lightning won the best-of-seven series, four games to one, for their second consecutive and the third overall championship in franchise history. Tampa Bay had home-ice advantage in the series with the better regular season record.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic that both shortened and delayed the start of the regular season, the series began on June 28, 2021, and concluded on July 7, 2021, marking the first time that games in the Stanley Cup Finals were held in July. The cross-border travel restrictions under the pandemic also forced the league to temporarily realign this season into four divisions with no conferences, putting all seven Canadian teams into one of those divisions. Consequently, a divisional-based postseason format was held, featuring intra-divisional matchups in the first two rounds. The four divisional playoff champions were then re-seeded by regular season points in the Stanley Cup Semifinals, with the winners of the Semifinals advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. Under a normal playoff format, this finals matchup would be impossible, as both the Lightning and Canadiens compete in the NHL's Eastern Conference. However, under the temporarily realigned divisions, some had mixed conferences, which enabled this scenario.\nThis was the first Finals since to be played entirely in the Eastern Time Zone, the first since to feature a Canadian-based team, the first since to end in a team winning the Stanley Cup at home, and the first since to require less than six games.\nThis Finals matchup broke the Stanley Cup Finals record for highest combined seed between teams, with twenty-six (Tampa Bay eighth, and Montreal eighteenth). This record was previously held by the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, which had a combined seed of twenty-three.\nPaths to the Finals.\nImpact of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted the league for the second straight year with the Government of Canada maintaining its cross-border travel restrictions. Consequently, the league temporarily realigned for this season into four regional divisions with no conferences, putting all seven Canadian teams into one of those divisions. Each team played 56 regular season games, all intra-divisional matchups. The league returned to the traditional 16-team playoff format, with the first two rounds of the playoffs also featuring intra-divisional matchups. This format delayed any possibility of cross-border travel until the third round. The league explored the possibility of having the Canadian team that advanced to the third round hold their home games in a neutral NHL city in the U.S. but were granted a cross-border travel exemption approved by the Public Health Agency of Canada.\nDue to local COVID-19 health protocols during the regular season, all 24 American teams hosted a limited amount of in-person spectators while all seven Canadian teams played behind closed doors. During the first three rounds of the playoffs, a number of U.S. teams further increased their capacity, and three of the Canadian playoff teams admitted spectators for the first time. The Canadiens were the first team from Canada to offer tickets to the general public. By the time the Finals started, Florida health officials had allowed the Lightning to admit 16,300 fans (85 percent of full capacity) at Amalie Arena for game 1, then allowed up to 100% capacity for game 2 and beyond. The Canadiens were permitted to issue 3,500 tickets for the Bell Centre after Quebec health officials denied the team's request to increase it to 10,500 fans (50 percent of capacity) before game 3.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nThis was the thirty-fifth Stanley Cup Finals appearance for this team. They have won the Stanley Cup a record twenty-four times (the second most championships in major North American sports behind the New York Yankees' twenty-seven World Series victories). They are the most recent Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup, doing so in 1993 (their most recent Finals appearance) against the Los Angeles Kings, winning in five games. They were also the first Canadian team since the 2011 Vancouver Canucks to reach the Finals.\nDuring the offseason, the Canadiens traded left wing Max Domi and a third-round pick for right wing Josh Anderson. They also picked up forwards Tyler Toffoli, Michael Frolik, and Corey Perry in free agency. The team also re-signed goaltender Jake Allen and forward Brendan Gallagher. During the season, Hobey Baker Award winner and rookie Cole Caufield made his debut with the Canadiens. The team traded for forward Eric Staal as well as defencemen Jon Merrill and Erik Gustafsson.\nOn February 24, 2021, head coach Claude Julien was fired after coaching the team through parts of five seasons during his second stint as head coach of the Canadiens, which had registered a 9–5–4 record to start the season. Assistant coach Dominique Ducharme was named interim head coach.\nThe team finished with a record of 24–21–11 to finish fourth in the North Division. In the playoffs, the Canadiens came back from a 3–1 deficit in their series with their rival Toronto Maple Leafs to win in seven games, swept the Winnipeg Jets in the second round, and knocked off the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup Semifinals in six games. \nAs they have done in the past, the Canadiens chose to use the French version of the Stanley Cup Finals logo patch on their jerseys.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was Tampa Bay's second consecutive Finals appearance and fourth overall, having won the previous year's Finals against the Dallas Stars in six games.\nTampa Bay made very few transactions to gain players in the offseason. They traded away Braydon Coburn and Cedric Paquette and let Zach Bogosian, Kevin Shattenkirk and Carter Verhaeghe walk via free agency. They re-signed Anthony Cirelli, Patrick Maroon, Luke Schenn, and Mikhail Sergachev. During the season, Tampa Bay traded for defenceman David Savard and traded away forward Alexander Volkov. Forward Nikita Kucherov, who had hip surgery prior to the regular season, returned for the playoffs.\nTampa Bay finished with a 36–17–3 record to finish third in the Central Division. In the playoffs, the Lightning defeated their intrastate rival, the Florida Panthers, in six games in the first round. The Lightning then triumphed over the Carolina Hurricanes in five games and in the Stanley Cup Semifinals, in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference Final, they defeated the New York Islanders in seven games.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe Lightning took the lead early in the first period. With Tampa Bay defenseman Erik Cernak joining the rush with Ondrej Palat, Palat passed to an open Cernak who fired a wrist shot past Carey Price resulting in a 1–0 lead for Tampa Bay. In the second period, the Lightning grabbed a 2–0 lead when Blake Coleman's shot through traffic deflected off of Yanni Gourde and into the net. The Canadiens then halved the Lightning's lead as their offensive-zone coverage swept Tampa Bay's end setting up Ben Chiarot for a one-timer and Montreal's first goal of the game. The Lightning regained their two-goal lead in the third period when Nikita Kucherov's shot across the net got swatted by Chiarot and into his own net. After Brayden Point won a faceoff, the puck was picked up by Kucherov who fired a wrist shot past Price to gain a 4–1 lead. Towards the end of the third period and with frustrations boiling over for Montreal, Joel Edmundson took a roughing penalty with 2:40 left in the period. On the ensuing power-play, Kucherov passed to captain Steven Stamkos whose shot got past Price for a 5–1 lead, sealing the victory for the Lightning. The goal ended Montreal's penalty-killing streak at 32.\nGame two.\nIn game two, the Canadiens poured off more shots than in the first game. The first period saw Montreal make thirteen shots compared to Tampa Bay's six. However, neither team was able to score in the opening frame. In the second period, Montreal had more than double the shots of Tampa Bay, yet the Lightning ended up with two goals in contrast to the Canadiens' one. The first Lightning goal came from Anthony Cirelli, whose point shot pinballed in off of Carey Price's blocker and into the net. After Lightning defenceman Mikhail Sergachev committed an interference penalty on Artturi Lehkonen, Montreal tied the score on a power-play when Nick Suzuki floated a backhand shot through traffic and under Andrei Vasilevskiy's pads. With 1.1 seconds left in the second period, Tampa Bay forward Barclay Goodrow got past Ben Chiarot forcing a two-on-one with Blake Coleman. Goodrow passed it to Coleman who shot it past Price for the buzzer-beater. In the third period, Montreal continued to pressure the Lightning and Vasilevskiy, however, after a dump-in by Tampa Bay ended up in the Canadiens' zone, an errant pass off the boards by Joel Edmundson gave the puck away to Ondrej Palat, scoring the goal that made it 3–1. At the end of the game, both Corey Perry and Cirelli each received misconducts after an altercation.\nGame three.\nIn the first four minutes of the first period, the Lightning grabbed a 2–0 lead. The first goal came from a point shot through traffic by Jan Rutta. After Eric Staal shot the puck over the glass causing a power-play for Tampa Bay, Victor Hedman scored the second goal when his point shot bounced off of Carey Price and into the net. The Canadiens were able to score a goal within their seventeen shots as a two-on-one with captain Shea Weber and Phillip Danault allowed the latter's wrist shot to rip off both posts and past Andrei Vasilevskiy. In the second period, the Lightning followed the same momentum from the first period with another two goals in the first four minutes. When an errant change by Montreal created an opening for Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov, Kucherov fired the puck past Price. At 3:33, the Lightning began another two-on-one rush during which Mathieu Joseph's shot rebounded to Tyler Johnson who scored to give Tampa Bay a 4–1 lead. However, just like the first period, Montreal scored which brought their deficit to two. Nick Suzuki, who drove down the right side of Tampa Bay's defensive zone, shot the puck under Vasilevskiy's pads. In the third period, the Lightning mainly held a defensive strategy. In the final five minutes, the Lightning gained a three-goal lead again when defenceman Erik Gustafsson gave the puck away to Johnson and he scored his second goal of the game. The Canadiens quickly rebounded after pulling their goalie and Corey Perry scored top-shelf over Vasilevskiy. However, with the empty net, the Lightning took advantage as Blake Coleman backhanded the puck into the net and the game ended 6–3.\nGame four.\nIn the first period, the Canadiens scored first, taking their first lead in the series, as Nick Suzuki made a pretty passing play to Josh Anderson who fired it past Andrei Vasilevskiy. The Lightning were able to continue pressuring the Canadiens into the second period. This pressure led to a backhand pass by Ryan McDonagh to Barclay Goodrow as he fired the puck into an open net. In the third period, Alexander Romanov fired a wrist shot from the blue line, scoring to make it 2–1 for Montreal. The Lightning tied it five minutes later when Mathieu Joseph sprung a two-on-one with Patrick Maroon and the latter scored, ending his goal-scoring drought. With the game tied 2–2 after the third period, both teams headed to overtime. In overtime, the Canadiens killed a double-minor penalty caused by Shea Weber and less than a minute later, Anderson put the puck past Vasilevskiy, preventing the first four-game sweep in the Finals since , and winning the game 3–2.\nGame five.\nTampa Bay dominated during the first period of game five, recording thirteen shots on target to the Canadiens' four, but neither team scored. The second period had the opposite trend, with the Canadiens getting ten shots compared to the Lightning's six shots. Nevertheless, it was Tampa Bay who scored the opening goal, when Ryan McDonagh set up a David Savard shot that was tipped in by Ross Colton. It would prove to be the only goal of the contest. Tampa Bay held onto their one-goal lead throughout the third period, with Andrei Vasilevskiy recording a shutout. The 1–0 victory won the series for Tampa Bay and their second consecutive Stanley Cup.\nVasilevskiy was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player during the playoffs. With their victory, the Lightning became the first team since the 1983 New York Islanders to win the Stanley Cup without winning an overtime game during the playoffs. Patrick Maroon won the Stanley Cup in three consecutive seasons, a feat which hadn't occurred since multiple members of the 1983 New York Islanders accomplished it. Maroon was the first player since Ed Litzenberger in 1963 to win the Stanley Cup in three consecutive years with two different teams.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe Stanley Cup was presented to Lightning captain Steven Stamkos by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman following the Lightning's 1–0 win in Game 5.\nThe following Lightning players and staff qualified to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup:\n2020–21 Tampa Bay Lightning\nPlayer notes.\nThese players were on the extended roster during the playoffs, with most having played regular-season games for Tampa Bay. None appeared in the playoffs. They received championship rings, but were left off the Stanley Cup.\nMedia rights.\nWith the series running through the first week of July, no games were held on either Canada Day (July 1) or American Independence Day (July 4) to avoid scheduling conflicts.\nIn Canada, this was the seventh consecutive Stanley Cup Finals broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC Television in English, and TVA Sports in French. The series was also streamed on Sportsnet Now and Rogers NHL Live.\nIn the United States, this was the sixteenth consecutive and final Stanley Cup Finals produced by NBC Sports under their ten-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. NBCSN aired the first two games, while NBC televised the rest of the series. When the series started, only the first two games were available on Peacock, NBC's streaming service. However, on July 2, the day of game three, NBCUniversal announced that the remainder of the series would also be available on Peacock. Under the new seven-year contracts that began the next season, coverage of the Stanley Cup Finals will be rotated annually between ABC (which broadcast its first Stanley Cup Finals since 2004) in even years, and TNT (which will broadcast the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time ever in 2023; the first time the series will be aired entirely on cable television) in odd years.\nIn Canada, Chris Cuthbert filled-in for Jim Hughson as Sportsnet lead play-by-play announcer after Hughson decided to not travel this season, and opted to only call national Vancouver Canucks home games due to COVID-19 pandemic. Hughson would later announce his retirement in September 2021.\nIn the U.S., Kenny Albert replaced the retired Mike \"Doc\" Emrick as NBC lead play-by-play announcer, having previously filled in for Emrick in game one of the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals due to a death in the latter's family. NBC lead color commentator Eddie Olczyk missed game two due to a personal matter, so \"Inside-the-Glass\" reporter Brian Boucher moved to the booth with Albert, and Pierre McGuire took over for Boucher between the benches. McGuire also called Game 3 of this series since Boucher missed that game for the same reason. After the Finals, Albert and Olczyk moved on to become TNT’s lead broadcast team (erstwhile NBC studio analyst Keith Jones was later added to join the pair), while Boucher joined ESPN/ABC. McGuire meanwhile, was hired by the Ottawa Senators as the team's senior vice-president of player development on July 12, having gone nearly three full decades without a managerial job in the NHL.\nThe series averaged 3.6 million people on Sportsnet and CBC, making it the most watched Finals in Canada since the last time a Canadian team advanced this far in . Meanwhile, the series averaged 2.52 million U.S. viewers, an increase from the 2.15 million average during the previous season's COVID-19-delayed Finals."

        "title": "Sam Long (baseball)",
        "text": "Samuel Trenton Long (born July 8, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Kansas City Royals organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. He played college baseball at California State University, Sacramento. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Rays in the 18th round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft. In 2018, at 23 years of age, he stopped playing baseball for a year and explored becoming a firefighter, but would later debut in MLB in 2021.\nHigh school and college.\nLong was born and raised in Fair Oaks, California.\nLong first attended Rosemont High School, for which he played baseball for two seasons. He then attended Del Campo High School in Carmichael, California as a junior and senior. He was all-league in baseball in 2012. In 2013, he was 4–0 with an 0.88 earned run average (ERA) and 49 strikeouts with only one walk in innings pitched. He was named Capital Valley Conference MVP that year.\nLong played college baseball at California State University, Sacramento for the Hornets. In 2014, he was 8–2 with a 3.03 ERA and was second in the Western Athletic Conference with two shutouts. He was named the WAC's Freshman of the Year, and a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American.\nIn 2015 he was 6–4 for the Hornets with a 2.81 ERA, and was 2nd in the conference in WHIP (0.892), third in hits per nine innings pitched (6.4), eighth in strikeouts/walk (3.94) and with 63 strikeouts (in innings), and ninth in walks/9 IP (1.6).\nIn 2016, he was 5–8 with a 3.99 ERA, and was eighth in the conference with 68 strikeouts (in innings). He suffered two herniated disks, but pitched through the injury. As of December 2020, his .224 career average against ranked third all-time for the college, and his wins (19) ranked sixth.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nLong was drafted by the Tampa Bay Rays in the 18th round, 540th overall, of the 2016 MLB draft, and signed for a signing bonus of $75,000. He made his professional debut with the GCL Rays, and also played for the rookie ball Princeton Rays, recording a 1–1 record and 3.33 ERA in 11 appearances between the two teams.\nHe split the 2017 season between the Low-A Hudson Valley Renegades and the Single-A Bowling Green Hot Rods, posting a 2.27 ERA with 29 strikeouts in 31.2 innings pitched across 20 appearances.\nOn March 22, 2018, on the last day of spring training, Long was released by the Rays organization.\nAt that point, in lieu of playing baseball which he felt was not going to work out, and uncertain as to what he would do with his future, the 23-year-old Long took EMT classes during the summer, thinking perhaps he would become a firefighter. In the fall he resumed studying for his communications degree at Sacramento State.\nHowever, Long had second thoughts about walking away from baseball, and started getting back into shape by eating better and working out hard, went back to his natural over-the-top arm slot, and found that his velocity increased and his curveball was sharper. His agent uploaded a highlight reel to Twitter that went viral of him throwing with his fastball around 93 mph. A Chicago White Sox area scout saw the video and called.\nChicago White Sox.\nAfter not playing for a team in 2018, Long signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox organization on March 5, 2019. He spent the 2019 season in Single-A with the Kannapolis Intimidators, pitching to an 8–5 record and 3.06 ERA with 112 strikeouts and a WHIP of 1.041 in 97.0 innings of work. He held batters to a .205 batting average, with 10.4 strikeouts and 2.6 walks per nine innings, and his fastball hit 95 mph.\nLong did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He elected free agency on November 2, 2020.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn November 17, 2020, Long signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants organization that included an invitation to spring training. He was assigned to the Double-A Richmond Flying Squirrels to start the 2021 season, later receiving a promotion to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, where he logged 7.2 scoreless innings.\nLong was ranked the 11th-best Giants prospect before the 2021 season. In spring training in 2021, his fastball was up to 97 mph. On June 7, 2021, it was announced that Long would be promoted to the major leagues for the first time during the following series, to be the starting pitcher against the Texas Rangers. At the time, for the season he had a 1.99 ERA with 37 strikeouts and 5 walks in 22.2 innings, between Double-A and Triple-A.\nOn June 9, he was formally selected to the active roster. In Long's debut game, Zack Littell got the start instead, and was replaced by Long in the second inning. Long notched his first MLB strikeout in the game, punching out Rangers infielder Nick Solak, and struck out seven of the first ten batters he faced. He finished his debut with four innings of one-run ball, with 7 strikeouts. He earned his first career victory on June 20, beating the Philadelphia Phillies with six innings of 2-run ball.\nIn the 2021 regular season for the Giants, Long was 2–1 with a 5.53 ERA. He pitched 40.2 innings over 12 games (5 starts). Pitching for three minor league teams: Triple-A Sacramento, Double-A Richmond, and the Single-A San Jose Giants, he was 1–1 with a 2.34 ERA in 42.1 innings over 16 games (7 starts).\nIn 2022 with the Giants, Long was 1–3 with one save and a 3.61 ERA in 28 games (6 starts), in which he threw 42.1 innings. On July 6, Long recorded his first save against the Arizona Diamondbacks, striking out Jordan Luplow on three pitched as his only batter faced. In 2022 with Sacramento, Long was 1–0 with a 4.32 ERA in 8 games (3 starts) in which he threw 16.2 innings. His season ended prematurely on August 26, when he was placed on the injured list with a right oblique strain.\nLong was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento to begin the 2023 season. He struggled to a 9.90 ERA in 4 appearances for Sacramento before he was designated for assignment on April 19, 2023.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn April 23, 2023, Long was traded to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for cash considerations. In 40 appearances for Oakland, he registered a 5.60 ERA with 32 strikeouts and 2 saves in 45.0 innings of work. On October 12, Long was removed from the 40–man roster and sent outright to the Triple-A Las Vegas Aviators. He elected free agency on November 6.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 7, 2023, Long signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals."

        "title": "Cheating in baseball",
        "text": "Baseball personnel have cheated by deliberately violating or circumventing the game's rules to gain an unfair advantage against an opponent. Examples of cheating include doctoring the ball, doctoring bats, electronic sign stealing, and the use of performance-enhancing substances. Other actions, such as fielders attempting to mislead baserunners about the location of the ball, are considered gamesmanship and are not in violation of the rules.\nTypes of cheating.\nDoctoring the baseball.\nPitchers have long doctored baseballs to gain an unfair advantage. The spitball is an illegal baseball pitch where the ball has been altered by the application of a foreign substance, such as saliva or petroleum jelly. The emery ball, also an illegal pitch, consists of throwing a ball that has been scuffed by a rough surface, such as an emery board or sandpaper. Major League Baseball (MLB) banned the emery ball in 1914 and banned the spitball in 1920. At the time the spitball was banned, 17 active pitchers were allowed to continue to throw the pitch through a grandfather clause; the last of these was Burleigh Grimes, who played until 1934.\nExamples of illegal doctoring include Joe Niekro, who was caught with an emery board and a small piece of sandpaper during a game on August 3, 1987—he was ejected and suspended for 10 days. Preacher Roe, who pitched in MLB for 12 seasons during 1938–1954, was featured in a 1955 \"Sports Illustrated\" article entitled \"The Outlawed Spitball Was My Money Pitch\". Gaylord Perry, a hall of famer and major league pitcher from 1962 to 1983, entitled his 1974 autobiography \"Me and the Spitter\", although he was only ejected once for doctoring the baseball.\nGrip enhancers.\nPitchers may unfairly improve their grip on the baseball. Applying a sticky substance such as pine tar to their pitching hand can greatly improve the spin rate of a thrown baseball, which results in more movement on breaking balls. While the use of such \"foreign substances\" is a violation of MLB rules, historically it was rarely enforced. The only substance that pitchers may legally use to improve their grip is rosin, via a rosin bag kept on the mound.\nGrip enhancing substances are usually hidden somewhere, such as inside a pitcher's glove or cap, so it can be accessed while pitching. Michael Pineda of the New York Yankees was ejected from a game on April 23, 2014, after being caught with a smear of pine tar on the right side of his neck. Although Pineda claimed that he had applied it \"trying to be careful not to hit somebody on the other team\", he was suspended for 10 games.\nLarge increases in measured spin rates during the 2020 and 2021 MLB seasons led to scrutiny of this area. A highly effective grip enhancer used by pitchers to increase spin rates has been Spider Tack, a product developed for strongman competitors to have a better grip on concrete Atlas stones.\nIn May 2021, four pitchers in Minor League Baseball received 10-game suspensions after being caught using grip enhancers.\nOn June 15, 2021, MLB announced new guidance regarding \"a uniform standard for the consistent application of the rules, including regular checks of all pitchers regardless of whether an opposing club's manager makes a request.\" Included in MLB's announcement were mandatory checks of all pitchers by umpires, with any player found to have a foreign substance immediately ejected and suspended for 10 games. Enforcement across MLB began on June 21, with Seattle Mariners pitcher Hector Santiago becoming the first player to be ejected under the heightened enforcement, on June 27.\nCorked bats.\nHitters have doctored their baseball bats with lighter materials to allow them to swing the bat faster compared to a solid wood bat of equal size. A corked bat is one with some of its interior removed and replaced with a lighter material, such as cork or Super Balls. Players who have been suspended for using a corked bat include Sammy Sosa, Albert Belle, Wilton Guerrero, Chris Sabo, Billy Hatcher, José Guillén, and Miguel Olivo. Though Graig Nettles was caught using a bat with Super Balls in 1974, he was not suspended. Amos Otis and Norm Cash admitted to using corked bats during Major League Baseball games.\nSign stealing.\nBaseball players can gain an advantage by stealing the signs used by other teams. However, they are prohibited from using technology to aid them in stealing signs and communicating the information to their teammates. Two notable incidents of sign stealing include the 1951 New York Giants, who used a telescope and buzzer system, and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal of 2017–2018. The Boston Red Sox were fined for having used an Apple Watch to relay stolen signs during the 2017 season, and had their video replay operator suspended for the 2020 season after he used video replay to decode sign sequences during some games in 2018.\nPerformance-enhancing substances.\nBaseball players have used amphetamines and steroids to enhance their physical performance. The United States Army gave amphetamines, such as Dexedrine and Benzedrine, to soldiers during World War II, and baseball players who fought in the war introduced them to baseball clubhouses after they returned. During the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985, Dave Parker and Dale Berra testified in court that Willie Stargell provided them with amphetamines, while John Milner testified about Willie Mays' use of amphetamines. Anabolic steroids were banned by baseball in 1991, though no program was established for drug testing.\nFollowing the 1998 home run record chase, more attention was paid to steroids and other performance-enhancing substances. In 2002, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement that included mandatory testing for performance-enhancing substances. The federal government began to investigate the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) in 2003; the ensuing BALCO scandal resulted in a federal grand jury investigation that compelled testimony from athletes including Marion Jones, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds, and determined that 27 athletes received steroids from BALCO. A panel of players and executives testified on steroid use in baseball before the House Government Reform Committee in 2005. Former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell led a 20-month investigation on steroids in baseball that resulted in the release of the Mitchell Report in 2007.\nMandatory testing expanded to include amphetamines and other stimulants in 2005. In 2011, testing was expanded to include human growth hormone (HGH). The Biogenesis scandal broke in 2013, alleging that Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun acquired HGH from an anti-aging clinic. A total of 13 players received suspensions.\nAltering the grounds.\nGroundskeepers have been involved in attempts to cheat. On April 25, 1981, Seattle Mariners manager Maury Wills had the Seattle grounds crew draw the batter's box longer than allowed by the rule book (towards the pitching mound) as the Oakland Athletics had previously complained that Seattle batter Tom Paciorek was stepping outside the box while batting. Oakland manager Billy Martin spotted the modified batters box prior to the game; the box was correctly redrawn, and Wills was subsequently suspended for two games. Teams would also often water down basepaths to slow down opposing baserunners, something which was considered gamesmanship. Opposing teams suspected that airflow in the Metrodome, home of the Minnesota Twins from 1982 to 2009, was manipulated to help the Twins' balls up and out and push the away team's inwards; a former superintendent claimed in 2003 that he had done so, and characterized it as \"home-field advantage\".\nPitching in the 19th century.\nIn its early genesis, how baseball was played on the field evolved rapidly. The original role of pitchers was to put the ball into play for batters to hit, rather than try to prevent batters from striking the ball, as described in the inaugural Knickerbocker Base Ball Club rule set from 1845: \"The ball must be pitched, not thrown, for the bat.\"\nPitchers began intentionally throwing pitches hard to hit, however, waiting for batters to eventually swing at them, until the introduction in 1863 of \"called balls\" by the umpire \"[s]hould the pitcher repeatedly fail to deliver to the striker fair balls\".\nThe term \"pitch\" in the rule referred to throwing with a straight, stiff arm and wrist, in an underhanded style influenced by cricket bowlers.\nIt was common though for pitchers to flick their wrists to impart spin, thereby affecting the baseball's trajectory.\nBy the late 1860s, the restrictions against bending at the elbow or snapping the wrist were rarely enforced, and thus in 1872 the rules were changed to permit them. Although pitchers were still required to throw underhanded, their motion crept up over time to a three-quarter style, which led to the rules being altered in 1883 to allow it. A full overhand delivery was only permitted by the National League in 1884, and by the American Association in 1885.\nAge fabrication.\nPlayers have lied about their own ages to increase the level of interest they receive from scouts. Players who claimed to be younger than they were include Rube Marquard, Phil Rizzuto, Pee Wee Reese, and Hal McRae.\nMany baseball players from the Dominican Republic engage in age fabrication to improve their chances of getting a contract offer. Some have also changed their names, including Roberto Hernández and Juan Carlos Oviedo. Danny Almonte competed in the 2001 Little League World Series, despite being 14 years old and the cutoff age for the tournament being set at 12.\nOther actions to circumvent rules.\nVarious other efforts to skirt the rules have been employed. A prominent example of intentionally trying to lose a game, which can enable gamblers who are involved with such a scheme to win significant amounts of money, is the Black Sox Scandal of 1919 that resulted in eight players being permanently banned from professional baseball.\nOn August 19, 1951, the St. Louis Browns sent Eddie Gaedel to bat—Gaedel had been signed to a contract by team owner Bill Veeck because of his height of , which made his strike zone exceptionally small. Gaedel walked (as expected) and was replaced by a pinch runner. American League president Will Harridge voided Gaedel's contract the following day, and unsuccessfully attempted to strike Gaedel's appearance from the record books.\nIn 1987, a minor-league catcher for the Double-A Williamsport Bills hid a potato in his glove, which he threw past a runner at third base so the runner would attempt to score, and then tagged out the runner with the real baseball. The umpires ruled that the run counted. The catcher was removed from the game by his manager and later released by the team.\nAfter being ejected from a game on June 9, 1999, New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine changed his appearance by putting on a hat, sunglasses, and a fake mustache, then returned to the dugout—he was spotted, and later suspended for two games.\nThe 2014 Little League World Series saw the disqualification of the second-place team after it was found that many of the players lived outside of the acceptable geographic range.\nPenalties for cheating.\nWhen detected by an umpire during a game, illegal actions such as doctoring the baseball or using a doctored bat result in an immediate ejection. Such ejections are rare in Major League Baseball, with less than 50 instances of \"doctored\" or \"doctoring\" appearing in a log of nearly 18,000 ejections since 1889—by comparison, \"fighting\" appears over 700 times. Any professional player who is ejected from a game typically receives a mandatory fine, and additional penalty may also be imposed in follow-up by league officials, such as a suspension for a number of games or calendar days.\nActs of cheating that are not detected during a game may still result in punishment. The above noted incidents of illegal sign stealing during 2017 and 2018 by the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox were discovered after-the-fact, and resulted in punishment meted out by the Commissioner of Baseball. As punishment for the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, general manager Jeff Luhnow, field manager A. J. Hinch, and bench coach Alex Cora (who had subsequently become manager of the Boston Red Sox) were each suspended for the 2020 MLB season by commissioner Rob Manfred, which further resulted in Luhnow and Hinch being fired by the Astros.\nRule 21 of \"The Official Professional Baseball Rules Book\" enumerates misconduct for which personnel can be declared permanently ineligible: misconduct in playing baseball (throwing games), gifts to umpires, and gambling on a baseball game \"in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform\". The rule is required to be posted, in both English and Spanish, in all major league clubhouses. For determining penalties for other violations, broad discretion is granted to the commissioner via Rule 50, \"Enforcement of Major League Rules\", which specifies \"action consistent with the commissioner's powers under the Major League Constitution\".\nSteroid use, admitted or suspected, has affected balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame for multiple players, including: Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Gary Sheffield, and Sammy Sosa. Shoeless Joe Jackson is generally considered to have had a Hall of Fame-worthy career, including a .356 batting average in 13 major-league seasons, but is ineligible for election due to his permanent ban resulting from the Black Sox Scandal. Pete Rose, the all-time MLB leader in several categories including hits, singles, and games played, accepted a permanent ban in 1989 shortly after publication of an investigation into his involvement with betting on baseball. In 1991, the Hall of Fame declared all permanently banned individuals to be ineligible for induction, even after their death."

The Big Red began with a game against Colgate, the defending champion, and ended up losing their chance at the title straight away. Cornell surrendered the first three goals of the game and the heroics in the later half couldn't overcome the early deficit. The Big Red recovered for two consolation wins to finish the championship.\nAfter returning from the winter break, Cornell was able to get in one practice before the rematch with Colgate. The team was contending with a great deal of turnover due to graduation and injuries and the Raiders took full advantage. Team captain Harry Bill knocked the puck into the Cornell goal but the mistake didn't affect the game as the score was already 0–3 and the Raiders shut down the Big Red offense. Entering the next game, Cornell was able to get a weeks-worth of practice under their belt and hoped to get back on the winning side of the ledger. Army, however, was not accommodating and the strong Cadets squad scored six consecutive goals in the second to take the game 8–4.\nDue to warm weather, all of Cornell home dates were eventually scrapped and the team didn't hit the ice until late February when they travelled to face Hamilton.

In particular, the Board manages the selection of venues for events organized by the IWSA in cooperation with the management of the venues where the IWSA events will be organized, for the related financial requirements and for the coordination of the dates of winter swimming events. The basic goal of the activities of the Board and the IWSA is to ensure the safety and health of winter swimmers during winter swimming events.\nRules.\nAt the IWSA event site water is classified into three temperature categories: category A indicates water with temperature below or equal 2 °C, category B indicates water with a temperature above 2 °C to 5 °C (including) and category C denotes water above 5 °C. This indicates which races can take place: for competitions up to 200 m, category A is also permissible, for endurance swim 450 m both category B and C are allowed and 1000 m races are held in water of category C. Scoring for ranking in competitions also depends on the water category. Winter Swimming World Championships have detailed rules published on the IWSA website. [4] For the purposes of classification in competitions and registration, competitors have individual IWSA-accounts to manage personal information and are assigned an appropriate IWSA identification number (IWSA-ID) that is used to register swimmers and score them at races. The results of the races, which have taken place since 2015, are published on the IWSA website.\nFor the realized IWSA-competitions, the best achieved times in each age category are recorded and absolute records on individual men's and women's tracks are also registered. \nIWSA-motto is: \"No water is too cold.\"\nMedical requirements for swimmers.\nFor competitions for 450 m and 1000 m, swimmers must meet the requirement to complete the qualifying race on the 200 m track (for competitive swimming for 450 m) resp. 450 m (for competitive swimming at 1000 m) in water up to 5 °C, as evidenced by the AFFIDAVIT declaration form. In addition, the day before these races, there is usually a mandatory health check consisting of measuring the competitor's blood pressure and ECG examination (often with the requirement to have the result of an earlier ECG examination from their place of residence).\nFor the 10th anniversary of IWSA, official video \"IWSA - 10 years\" was issued. And following references concerning WSWC 2020 in Bled are examples of organization, rules and result of IWSA-event."

        "text": "Sean McCann (born September 18, 1971) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former defenceman who was an All-American for Harvard.\nCareer.\nMcCann was a member of Ronn Tomassoni's first recruiting class at Harvard. He played a solid defensive game for the Crimson, helping the team to a decent record as a freshman. The team finished atop their conference standings in his sophomore and junior seasons while being one of the best defensive teams in the country. In 1993 Harvard returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since winning the championship in 1989 but were undone by a double overtime loss in the opening round.\nFor his senior season, McCann was named team captain and went on to produce a rather astounding career year. He more than quadrupled his previous years point total and more than quintupled his goal production. He led the team to its third consecutive first-place finish in ECAC Hockey and the programs' first conference championship in seven years. Harvard received the second eastern seed and a bye into the NCAA quarterfinals. The Crimson easily handled New Hampshire to make the Frozen Four but couldn't overcome eventual champion Lake Superior State, losing 2–3 in overtime. McCann was named an All-American for the year and was drafted first overall in the 1994 NHL Supplemental Draft, the final such draft held.\nMcCann continued his new-found production as a professional, playing well during the 94–95 season and then doubling his point production in year two at the top level of the minor leagues. Unfortunately, McCann never received an appearance at the NHL level despite producing on both good and bad teams in AAA hockey. After 6 seasons as a professional, McCann retired in 2001.\nAfter a season away from the game, McCann returned as an assistant coach at his alma mater. He helped Harvard win two more conference titles and make four consecutive NCAA appearances (losing every game) during his 7-year stint behind the bench. In 2009 McCann left Harvard to become the head coach at Saint Sebastian's School, a highly regarded prep school. While there he instructed several future star players including Noah Hanifin and Danny O'Regan. He continued to serve as the leader for the program as of 2021.\nHe was inducted into the Harvard Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of George Meade (Philadelphia)",
        "text": "Major General George Gordon Meade is an equestrian statue that stands in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. The statue, which was unveiled in 1887, was designed by sculptor Alexander Milne Calder and honors George Meade, who had served as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was later a commissioner for the park. The statue is one of two statues of Meade at Fairmount, with the other one being a part of the Smith Memorial Arch.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nGeorge Meade was an 1835 graduate of the United States Military Academy who served as an officer in the United States Army during Mexican–American War and, later, the American Civil War. In the latter, Meade participated in the Eastern Theater and saw action at the Battle of Antietam in 1862. Meade was later made commander of the Union Army of the Potomac and delivered a devastating defeat to the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Gettysburg. Meade would continue to command the army until the war's end in 1865. The following year, Meade became a commissioner of Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In this position, he was responsible for designing the layout of many of the paths through the park. He died several years later in November 1872.\nFollowing his death, the Fairmount Park Art Association (later renamed the Association for Public Art) created a committee to oversee the creation of a memorial for Meade. Fundraising soon commenced for what would be the association's first major commission. However, fundraising initially went poorly, due in part to the Panic of 1873 and competition from the Centennial Exposition. A group of 119 women constituting the Meade Memorial Women's Auxiliary Committee raised most of the $30,000 for the memorial. On October 19,1881, after a competition, sculptor Alexander Milne Calder was chosen as the sculptor for the monument. However, the project was subsequently shelved for several months while he continued to study at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Thomas Eakins. In December 1883, the association contracted Calder for a plaster sketch model to be ready May 1, 1884. A full-sized working model was later prepared by June 10, 1886, and by December of that year, casting had begun. This was done at the Henry Bonnard foundry in New York City, and a July 1887 article in \"The New York Times\" reported that the casting process had by then been completed. Metal from Confederate cannons that had been captured during the war was used to make the statue. The work was Calder's first large-scale bronze project, and he based his depiction of Meade off of photographs and recollections from both himself and Meade's family members. He was paid $25,000 for his work.\nThe statue was initially planned to be located in front of Philadelphia City Hall, where today there are equestrian statues honoring fellow Union Army officers George B. McClellan and John F. Reynolds. However, Meade's family wanted the statue to be placed in Fairmount Park due to Meade's affinity for and personal connection to the park.\nDedication and later history.\nThe statue was dedicated at Fairmount Park in a large ceremony held on October 18, 1887. Approximately 20,000 or 30,000 spectators were present for the unveiling. Several former Union officers were among those in attendance, including Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Fitz John Porter, and William B. Franklin, who had been Meade's superior during the Battle of Fredericksburg. Philadelphia Mayor Edwin Henry Fitler presided over the event, with music provided by both a chorus and the First Regiment Band. The ceremony began with an invocation by The Right Reverend Cortlandt Whitehead, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh. Following this, \"America\" was performed and Fitler made opening remarks. Benjamin H. Brewster then presented the statue, which was unveiled by two grandsons of Meade. George Henry Boker received the statue on behalf of the Fairmount Park Art Association, which was followed by an oration given by major general John Gibbon. The ceremony concluded with the doxology \"Old Hundred\". After the dedication, a reception was held at the Union League House that was attended by over 600 guests. Included among these were numerous military officers and veterans who had served with Meade, as well as several classmates who had attended the U.S. Military Academy with him. In addition, Pennsylvania Governor James A. Beaver was present.\nWhile the location for the monument was initially a well-traveled area, a decline in the nearby neighborhood caused the statue to receive significantly fewer sightseers. By 1913, the Grand Army of the Republic attempted to have the statue relocated due to its somewhat neglected area, without success. The monument has been the subject of vandalism, and a 2013 history book on Meade noted that the statue is \"neglected and obscure\". In recent years, efforts have been made to relocate the statue to in front of Philadelphia City Hall.\nIn 1993, the monument was surveyed as part of the Save Outdoor Sculpture! initiative.\nDesign.\nThe monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue of Meade atop a granite pedestal. The statue has a height of , a width of , and a depth of , while the pedestal has a height of , a width of , and a depth of . Meade, depicted with a moustache and beard, is dressed in his military uniform and has a sword hanging by his left leg. His left hand is holding the reins, while his right hand holds his hat by the saddle. The horse is modeled after Old Baldy. The statue is located in West Fairmount Park, on Lansdowne Drive north of Memorial Hall, and is facing towards Laurel Hill Cemetery, where Meade is buried. On the right side of the pedestal is inscribed \"CALDER SCULOR\" \"[sic]\", while the left side has the inscription \"HENRY BONNARD BRONZE CO. N.Y.\". On the front of the pedestal is \"MEADE\". Additionally, foundry marks are located on the statue.An article covering the unveiling in \"The New York Times\" states that \"[t]he design is a spirited one, and the execution all that could be desired\"."

The team's season was ended when they lost a heart-breaking triple overtime match to New Hampshire in the quarterfinals.\nIn his sophomore season, Kane began to come into his own, more than doubling his goal production as the team finished 1st in the CCHA again. Unfortunately, despite a runner-up finish in their conference tournament, the Falcons were passed over for the 1983 NCAA Tournament despite having gone 28–8–4 during the season. The following year Bowling Green left little doubt that they were one of the best teams in the country, finishing the regular season atop their conference for the third consecutive season and posted a 17-game winning streak. Kane was the team's leading scorer and named an All-American for his efforts. The Falcons nearly suffered a tragic end when they lost three consecutive games in the CCHA Tournament, but their record was too impressive to overlook and they received an at-large bid to the National Tournament.\nAfter overcoming a 3-goal deficit in the quarterfinal round, Bowling Green shut down perennial power Michigan State in the national semifinal to make their first Championship game appearance. In one of the most memorable games in college hockey history, Kane assisted on the quadruple-overtime game winner, ending the longest championship game in history (as of 2021). \nBoth Kane and teammate Gino Cavallini capitalized on their instant fame and signed professional contracts with the Calgary Flames, forgoing their final seasons of eligibility. They went through training camp in the fall of 1984 under the legendary Bob Johnson but were assigned to the minor league Moncton Golden Flames to start. Kane played a normal rotation in his first dozen games but, when his scoring didn't materialize, he saw his ice time reduced to just a few shifts per game. Kane was eventually sent to the Milwaukee Admirals and, while he did see his production jump significantly, he retired after the season.\nKane eventually went to work for Proforma, a printing and packing company. He was working as an executive in their Business and Sales department in 2021."

        "text": "The 2021 Copa América was an international football tournament held in Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021. The ten national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of up to 28 players, including at least three goalkeepers, an increase over the usual number of 23 players allowed. Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\nOn 22 March 2021, during a virtual meeting of its Council, CONMEBOL confirmed adjustments in the tournament regulations, several of these related to the player rosters, taking into account the conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInitially the ten national teams were required to register a provisional list with up to fifty players and then a final list of 23 players. However, on 28 May 2021, CONMEBOL decided to increase the provisional list up to sixty players and the final list up to 28 players at the request of some national associations. Each national team had to submit its provisional list of up to fifty players to CONMEBOL by 27 April 2021, 18:00 PYT () (Regulations Article 25) and could also register up to ten additional players until 1 June. Taking into consideration the fact that matchdays 7 and 8 of CONMEBOL's FIFA World Cup qualifiers were played only a few days before the start of the tournament, the final list of up to 28 players per national team could be submitted to CONMEBOL by 10 June 2021, 12:00 PYT (), three days prior to the opening match of the tournament. All players in the final selection must not have been excluded from the provisional list (Regulations Article 27).\nDespite the increase of players in the final lists, teams could still only name a maximum of 23 players on the match list for each tournament fixture (of which twelve were substitutes).\nOnce the final lists were registered, teams were only permitted to make replacements in cases of serious injuries up to 24 hours before their first match. Teams were also permitted to replace an injured goalkeeper with another at any time during the tournament (Regulations Article 28). In addition, any player with positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 could be replaced before and during the tournament (Regulations Article 30). All substitutes had to have the approval of the CONMEBOL Medical Commission and the replacement players did not need to be in the provisional list.\nBefore starting the final stage of the tournament, teams were able to replace a total of three players from their final list, with the replacement players coming from the provisional list (Regulations Article 29).\nThe final lists were published by CONMEBOL on 10 June 2021.\nThe age listed for each player is as of 13 June 2021, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament. A flag is included for coaches who are of a different nationality than their own national team.\nGroup A.\nArgentina.\nHead coach: Lionel Scaloni\nArgentina announced their final squad of 28 players on 11 June 2021.

He became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1981. Rackley's children enjoyed considerable sporting success: his daughters Margaret and Tish were both New Zealand volleyball representatives; and his sons Jeff, Les, Perry and Dean all represented New Zealand in boxing at Olympic or Commonwealth Games.\nBoxing trainer.\nActive as a boxing trainer from the 1960s to the 1980s, Rackley was known for his strict training regimes and no-nonsense approach.

The links course on the Morfa Conwy peninsula was designed by Jack Morris (nephew of Old Tom Morris). The championship course is long with a par of 72.\nHistory.\nIn 1869 a nine-hole course was set out by three Scottish gentlemen, which lays its claim to being the first golf course in Wales.\nA new nine hole course was laid out in 1875, when members of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club commissioned its design by their club professional, Jack Morris. Caernarfonshire Golf Club was formally established at Conwy Guildhall on 30 June 1890. In 1895 the course was extended to 18 holes and the club was a founding member of the Welsh Golfing Union. In 1899 the Welsh Amateur Golf Championships were held at the course, followed by the Welsh Professional Championship in 1905. The present clubhouse was built and opened on 1 June 1996, replacing the one built in 1934, which had become dilapidated. The original clubhouse from 1890 was a donated military mess hut from a nearby army camp. That was replaced in the early 1920s but that was destroyed by a fire during the summer of 1933.\nThe course was commandeered for military use during World War I, which decimated the original links course. In World War II the ninth green was lost as a result of the building of a military harbour on the Conwy Estuary. During the 1970s, Frank Pennink remodelled the front nine holes. In 1983 Brian Hugget and Neil Coles redesigned five of the holes on the back nine to accommodate the building of the A55 (North Wales Expressway).\nTournaments.\nThe Martini International tournament was held at Conwy Golf Club in 1970, when the title was shared by Doug Sewell and Peter Thomson.\nThe 41st Curtis Cup tournament was played at Conwy Golf Club on 26–28 August 2021. The club was originally hosting the event on 12–14 June 2020 but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

Keene, Commando easily won the race by a half length over the 1901 Preakness Stakes winner The Parader. Third place went to All Green who was never in the race from the start and wisely was not pushed by jockey Willie Shaw, finishing a further fifty lengths back.\nFor future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer James G. Rowe Sr., it marked the third of his record eight wins in the Belmont Stakes.\nCommando's Canadian-born jockey Henry Spencer earned his second of two career wins in the American Classics having won the 1900 Preakness Stakes aboard Hindus.\nThe 1901 Kentucky Derby was run on April 29 and the 1899 Preakness Stakes on May 28, five days after the Belmont.\nThe 1919 Belmont Stakes would mark the first time the race would be recognized as the third leg of a U.S. Triple Crown series."

        "text": "The 2021 Major League Rugby final was the third Major League Rugby championship match, held at the conclusion of the 4th season of the rugby union club competition in North America. It was played on August 1, 2021, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, between the LA Giltinis and Rugby ATL.\nBackground.\nWith the 2020 Major League Rugby season being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no Championship match, or series, held in 2020. Instead, the Championship series returned for the 2021 season, which featured the arrival of the LA Giltinis, and the departure of the Colorado Raptors, leaving 12 teams to take part over two conferences; the East and West.\nThe format for the regular season ensured that the top two teams of each conference would compete in a Conference Final, with the victors of each taking part in the Championship Final. The regular season ended with the LA Giltinis and the Utah Warriors as the top two teams in the Western Conference, and Rugby ATL and Rugby United New York as the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. This marked the first time in MLR history that the Seattle Seawolves would not contest the Championship Final.\nOn July 24, Rugby ATL ground out a narrow win over RUNY, 10–9, to become the Eastern Conference Champions. They also became the first Eastern-based team to make it to the Championship Final (previous finals only had teams that would later be from the Western Conference.)\nOn July 25, LA Giltinis were able to secure the victory in the final few minutes, with a try by Ryan James in the closing 5 minutes. Their 17–13 score means that they would become Western Conference Champions, the first time a debuting franchise would claim the title. This also ensured that the Championship Final would be contested against solely expansion franchises for the first time.\nVenue.\nThe venue was decided by which of the Conference Champions was ranked highest across both conferences. LA, with 63 points, ranked above Atlanta on 57, and held the home advantage for the Championship Final.\nBroadcasting.\nThe match was broadcast nationally on CBS. It averaged 478,000 viewers."

Central Zone are the most successful team in the history of the competition, winning the first three editions. The holders are North Zone, who won the most recent competition in 2017–18.\nHistory.\nThe competition began in February 2015, as the Senior Women's Cricket Inter Zonal Two Day Game, with the five zonal teams playing each other once in two-day matches, all held in Kolkata. No matches were won outright, but points were awarded for leading on the first innings of the match. Central Zone were the inaugural winners of the competition, winning three of their four matches on first innings.\nThe following season, 2015–16, the format was changed to three-day matches, and the tournament was held in Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh. Central Zone were again the champions, winning one match outright and another two on first innings. Central Zone won their third title in 2016–17, when the tournament was held in Chhattisgarh, winning two of their four matches.\nIn 2017–18 the competition was held in Kerala and was won for the first time by North Zone. \nCompetition format.\nTill the 2017–18 season, matches in the tournament were played using a three-day format (apart from the first season, in which matches were two-days). The five teams playws each other once in a round-robin format, therefore playing four matches in a season. All five teams competed in one league, with the team finishing top at the end of the season being crowned the champions.\nTeams were awarded 6 points for a win, 3 points for a tie and 0 points for a loss. If a match was drawn, the team that with the highest score at the end of the first innings received 3 points, whilst the team with the lower score receives one point. Both teams received 1 point if both first innings were not completed, the two scores were tied, or if the match was abandoned. If two teams were joint on points in the table, the tiebreakers were most wins and then net run rate.\nHowever, the tournament format was changed into a single-elimination tournament featuring quarter-finals, semi-finals and final for the 2023–24 season."

Each playoff match was originally planned take place at Esports Stadium Arlington in Arlington, Texas, aside from the final at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. However, due to increasing threat of COVID-19 and the delta variant, the matches were shifted to be played online.\nThe defending OWL champions were the San Francisco Shock, who won the title against the Seoul Dynasty in the 2020 OWL Grand Finals. The Shanghai Dragons swept the Atlanta Reign in the Grand Finals to win their first OWL championship.\nFormat.\nEight teams qualified for the season playoffs. In the league's West region, five teams qualified: the top three teams based on the Western regular season standings and the top two teams from the Western play-in tournament. In the league's East region, three teams qualified: the top two teams based on the Eastern regular season standings and the top team from the Eastern play-in tournament. The team with the most league points between the top seed in the West and top seed in the East was the first overall seed, while the other was the second seed. The team with the most league points between the second seed in the West and second seed in the East was the third overall seed, while the other was the fourth seed. The third seeded team in the West was the fifth overall seed. The three teams that qualified for the playoffs via the play-in tournaments were seeded sixth through eight based on league points. Any ties in league points were broken by the league's tiebreaking rules.\nThe playoffs were a double-elimination tournament. The top three seeds selected their opponent from seeds five through eight for the first round of the tournament, with the top seed selecting first and the third seed selecting last. In each match, the higher-seeded team had the choice of which map to play first from a pool of maps. Each following map was chosen by the losing team from the previous map.

To minimize latency between the East and West teams, the West region playoff teams travelled to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and played at the Innovation Lab and Information Technology Center buildings, while the East region teams played in their home country. The broadcasts were hosted from an outdoor stage at the Moana Hotel in Honolulu.\nWinnings.\nTeams in the season playoffs competed for a total prize pool of million, with the payout division detailed below."

For the first time since 2006, no players from outside the United Kingdom reached the quarter-final stage.\nThree nine-dart finishes were made in the tournament, the most in a single PDC World Championship. William Borland became the first ever player in a televised tournament to hit a nine-dart finish in a deciding leg, against Bradley Brooks in the first round. Darius Labanauskas then hit the second of the tournament the following day, in his first-round match against Mike De Decker. Price hit his first televised nine-dart finish, and the third of the tournament, against Michael Smith in the quarter-finals.\nThree players were forced to withdraw in the third round due to testing positive for COVID-19; on 27 December, Vincent van der Voort was forced to withdraw from the tournament ahead of his match against James Wade, three-time World Champion Michael van Gerwen withdrew the following day from his match against Chris Dobey, and Dave Chisnall withdrew on 29 December before his match against Luke Humphries.\nPeter Wright won the World Championship for the second time in his career, defeating Michael Smith 7–5 in the final.\nThe event would be the final event of William Hill's sponsorship deal with the PDC, as the organisation had announced on 18 July 2021 that it had reached a multi-year, multi-tournament sponsorship deal with British car sales company Cazoo for all of its events from 2022 and onwards, including the World Championship.\nFormat.\nAll matches were played as single in, double out; requiring the players to score 501 points to win a leg, finishing on either a double or the bullseye. Matches were played to set format, with each set being the best of five legs (first to three). After a one-year break, the tie-break rule came back into force. For all rounds except the first, the final set had to be won by two clear legs, unless the set score went to 5–5, in which case a sudden-death leg was played. This year, there was no throw for the bull in any sudden-death legs.\nThe matches got longer as the tournament progressed:\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the tournament was £2,500,000 in total – the same as the previous year. The winner's share was £500,000.\nQualification.\nQualifiers.\nThe top 32 from the PDC Order of Merit began the competition in the second round. The 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit (not already qualified) and 32 qualifiers from around the world began in the first round.\nThis was the first time since the 2014 PDC World Darts Championship that Michael van Gerwen would not be seeded for the tournament as the World number 1, with reigning champion Gerwyn Price taking his spot.\nOrder of Merit \"Second round (seeded)\"\n Gerwyn Price \"(quarter-finals)\"\n Peter Wright (champion)\n Michael van Gerwen \"(third round, COVID-19)\"\n James Wade \"(semi-finals)\"\n Dimitri Van den Bergh \"(second round)\"\n Gary Anderson \"(semi-finals)\"\n José de Sousa \"(third round)\"\n Jonny Clayton \"(fourth round)\"\n Michael Smith \"(runner-up)\"\n Nathan Aspinall \"(third round)\"\n Rob Cross \"(fourth round)\"\n Krzysztof Ratajski \"(second round)\"\n Joe Cullen \"(third round)\"\n Dave Chisnall \"(third round, COVID-19)\"\n Ryan Searle \"(fourth round)\"\n Stephen Bunting \"(second round)\"\n Dirk van Duijvenbode \"(fourth round)\"\n Danny Noppert \"(third round)\"\n Luke Humphries \"(quarter-finals)\"\n Simon Whitlock \"(second round)\"\n Mervyn King \"(quarter-finals)\"\n Daryl Gurney \"(third round)\"\n Brendan Dolan \"(second round)\"\n Glen Durrant \"(second round)\"\n Gabriel Clemens \"(third round)\"\n Mensur Suljović \"(second round)\"\n Ian White \"(third round)\"\n Devon Petersen \"(second round)\"\n Chris Dobey \"(fourth round)\"\n Damon Heta \"(third round)\"\n Kim Huybrechts \"(third round)\"\nPro Tour Order of Merit\"First round\"\nInternational Qualifiers\"First round\"\nSeeds.\n2021 winner Gerwyn Price, who since winning has also won the 2021 Grand Slam of Darts, was top of the two-year PDC Order of Merit and number one seed going into the tournament. 2020 winner Peter Wright, the winner of the 2021 World Matchplay and part of the victorious Scotland team at the 2021 PDC World Cup of Darts, was second seed and Michael van Gerwen, the three-time World Champion from 2014, 2017 and 2019, was third seed. As well as Price, Wright and Van Gerwen, two other previous PDC world champions qualified as seeds; 2015 and 2016 World Champion and 2021 runner-up Gary Anderson was 6th seeded, and 2018 World Champion and 2021 European Champion Rob Cross was the 11th seed. Two former champions of the BDO World Darts Championship qualified as seeds; three-time BDO champion Glen Durrant was the 24th seed with 2014 BDO champion Stephen Bunting in 16th.\nThe top seeds behind Price, Wright and Van Gerwen were 2021 UK Open champion James Wade, 2020 World Matchplay winner Dimitri Van den Bergh, Anderson, 2020 Grand Slam of Darts winner José de Sousa, and 2021 Masters, Premier League, World Series Finals and World Grand Prix champion Jonny Clayton.\nPro Tour qualification.\nCallan Rydz, a two-time event winner on the 2021 PDC Pro Tour, was the highest-ranked non-seed on the 2021 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit. 2007 World Champion Raymond van Barneveld returned as a Pro Tour qualifier, having announced his retirement following a first-round exit in 2020, and then reversed his decision after a year out. Van Barneveld was one of two former PDC World Champions to qualify via the Pro Tour, with 2011 and 2012 winner Adrian Lewis also qualifying. The highest-ranked debutant via the Pro Tour was Scott Mitchell, the 2015 BDO World Champion. As well as Mitchell and four-time BDO World Champion Van Barneveld, 1996 BDO champion Steve Beaton also qualified via the Pro Tour, making a record 31st consecutive World Championship appearance.\nAs well as Mitchell, other players qualifying for their PDC World Championship debuts were Alan Soutar, Jason Heaver, William Borland, Rusty-Jake Rodriguez, Lewy Williams, Florian Hempel and Chas Barstow. Martijn Kleermaker also appeared for the first time, having withdrawn from the 2021 tournament following a positive COVID-19 test. Other players qualifying via the Pro Tour included the 2021 World Youth Champion Ted Evetts and 2021 PDC World Cup of Darts finalist Rowby-John Rodriguez, who along with his brother Rusty-Jake became the fourth pair of siblings to compete in the same World Championship.\nUnranked qualifiers.\nThe final group of 32 qualifiers were determined by a series of international qualifiers and secondary tours. The PDC Development and Challenge Tours were split into UK and EU sections this year, meaning that an extra qualification spot was available via the Challenge Tour. The PDC Asian Tour was not held for a second consecutive year, with one-off qualification tournaments being held to replace it. The two Australian qualification spots were taken by Raymond Smith and Ky Smith, the first father-and-son to play in the same PDC World Darts Championship. Paul Lim qualified via the Singapore qualifier, becoming at age 67 and 326 days the oldest player to compete in the World Championship; while Fabian Schmutzler, who qualified via the Development Tour, was the second-youngest player ever to compete in the World Championship.\nFour-time BDO Women's World Champion Lisa Ashton qualified via the PDC Women's Tour, alongside Fallon Sherrock, the 2021 Grand Slam of Darts quarter-finalist and only woman to have previously won a match at the PDC World Darts Championship. The final three places were awarded to the winners of a qualification tournament for PDPA members, with the winners being Nick Kenny, Boris Krčmar and James Wilson.\nThree of the international qualifiers withdrew following the draw; Charles Losper and Lihao Wen, due to visa issues, and potential debutant Juan Rodriguez, following a positive test for COVID-19. They were replaced by runners-up from the PDPA qualifier in Order of Merit order, Mike De Decker, Gordon Mathers and Peter Hudson.\nDebutants via the international and invitation qualifiers were Roman Benecký, Chris Landman, John Norman Jnr, Fabian Schmutzler, Toyokazu Shibata, Ky Smith and Jim Williams.\nSummary.\nOpening rounds.\nThe first round of the tournament, running from 15 to 21 December, saw the 32 qualifiers from the PDC Pro Tour take on 32 players from international qualifiers. Two players hit nine-dart finishes in consecutive days, William Borland hitting one against Bradley Brooks in the final leg of his debut on 17 December, becoming the first player to hit a nine-darter in a sudden death leg to win a televised match; before Darius Labanauskas hit a second nine-darter in his defeat to Mike De Decker. Another high-profile match saw Fallon Sherrock take on Steve Beaton, with Beaton defeating the \"Queen of the Palace\" 3–2.\nThe second round, starting the same day as the first and running through to 23 December, saw the 32 seeds enter the tournament to take on first round winners. Two matches turned out to be between two former World Champions, with Rob Cross defeating Raymond van Barneveld and Gary Anderson eliminating Adrian Lewis in an early-round repeat of the 2011 and 2016 finals. Eight seeds were eliminated in the second round, the highest ranked of these being Dimitri Van den Bergh, the fifth seed, defeated by debutant Florian Hempel.\nPrior to the third round, three players had to withdraw after testing positive for COVID-19, those being Vincent van der Voort, Michael van Gerwen and Dave Chisnall, with their scheduled third round opponents receiving byes. After the withdrawal of former champion Van Gerwen, reigning champion Gerwyn Price said that the tournament was devalued, and called for the tournament to be postponed. Van Gerwen himself criticised the PDC for a lack of COVID checks on supporters, calling the tournament a \"big corona bomb\". Former PDC chairman Barry Hearn responded to these comments made, declaring calls for a postponement \"ignorant\", and said all fans had been confirmed to be double-vaccinated.\nIn the third round, running from 27 to 29 December, Price came through a last-leg tie-break against Kim Huybrechts, while Dirk van Duijvenbode fought back from 3–0 down to knock out Ross Smith 4–3. Former champion Gary Anderson did the same against Ian White, but Joe Cullen's attempt at a similar feat against Martijn Kleermaker faltered as he lost the final set. The last remaining international qualifier Raymond Smith ended Florian Hempel's run with a 4–1 win, while former champions Peter Wright and Rob Cross both safely qualified.\nThe fourth round, from 29 to 30 December, saw Price knock out van Duijvenbode in a match which saw chants of \"sheep shagging bastard\" directed at Price, which Welsh rugby former international Andy Powell and social media users branded as racist. Michael Smith eliminated Jonny Clayton in a 4–3 thriller. Raymond Smith's run was ended by Mervyn King, with King winning nine of the last ten legs to reverse a 3–1 deficit into a 4–3 victory. There was also 4–3 victories for Luke Humphries over Chris Dobey, both of whom had come through the third round via byes, and for Anderson over Cross in a clash of former World Champions. James Wade, another beneficiary of a bye, defeated Martijn Kleermaker 4–0, while Callan Rydz and Peter Wright defeated Alan Soutar and Ryan Searle respectively, both by a score of 4–1.\nFinal stages.\nThe quarter-finals were held on New Year's Day. Wade comfortably beat Mervyn King 5–0 to reach his fourth World Championship semi-final. The match between Anderson and Humphries saw the first four sets being shared between the two players, before Anderson took control and won the last three sets to triumph 5–2, reaching his seventh semi-final (second consecutively), and condemning Humphries to a third quarter-final exit in four years. Rydz held leads of 2–0, 3–1 and 4–3 over Wright, before Wright levelled and took the final set in extra legs to eliminate his unseeded opponent and reach his fourth semi-final. Finally, the match between Smith and Price saw the first eight sets go with throw; with Price both hitting the tournament's third nine-dart finish and missing two darts to break the eighth set and win the match; before Smith broke throw in the final set to reach his second semi-final.\nThe semi-finals were held on 2 January. In the first game Smith led from the start, winning the first set and then breaking Wade's throw to take the second set. Wade broke back in the third set before Smith restored the two-set advantage by breaking again in the fourth. Smith took sets five and six to go one away, and despite Wade taking the next two sets, he was not able to prevent Smith from triumphing, condemning Wade to a fourth semi-final defeat from four attempts and enabling Smith to reach his second World Championship final. In the second semi-final, Wright took the first three sets – two of them against throw – before Anderson broke back in the fourth set and then held in the fifth to close the gap to one. Wright stopped the comeback by holding throw in the sixth set, and from then on a high-quality match went with throw, with Wright breaking Anderson's record - set in the 2017 final - for most 180s in a World Championship match, with 24, and taking the win 6–4 to reach his third World Championship final.\nIn the final, held on 3 January, Peter Wright began the game in control of throw and took the first set 3–1, before breaking with a 148 checkout in the second set on his way to another 3–1 win. Smith closed the deficit with a 3–1 win in the third set, including a 167 checkout to break; and took the fourth set 3–2 after Wright missed two darts to break. Wright held the fifth set 3–2, and Smith took the sixth 3–1. The seventh set saw Smith take the lead in sets for the first time, and the first 3–0 win of a set, with Smith breaking the Wright throw twice. Wright however broke back in the eighth set 3–1. Smith took advantage of missed darts from Wright to win the ninth set 3–2 and regain the lead; but after going 2 legs up in the tenth set, he allowed Wright to come back and take the set to level again. Wright took the lead after winning the eleventh set 3–0 to move one away from the title; and took the next two legs in the twelfth set, and after Smith pulled one back, Wright sealed the title with a thirteen-dart hold, hitting double 16 to win his second World Championship.\nSchedule.\n \nTop averages.\nThis table shows the highest averages achieved by players throughout the tournament.\nRepresentation.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the tournament.

        "text": "The 1939–40 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 33rd season of play for the program. The teams were coached by Nick Bawlf in his 18th season.\nSeason.\nThe Big Red received good news at the start of the season. Not only would the team begin the year with several games at two tournaments but, unlike the previous season, the team received financial support from the organizing committee to balance out the cost of participating. The only bad news at the time was the (typical) warm winter that prevented the team from getting any on-ice practice. The lack of ice time led directly to two rather embarrassing losses at Playland. While the first to Colgate wasn't pretty, the game against Boston College was a debacle; BC blew out Cornell 24–1. It was by far the worst loss in the history of the program and did not portend well for the rest of their season.\nThe team headed to Lake Placid less than a week later and showed a dramatic improvement in such a short time. Their quarterfinal match against Hamilton provided the team with its first win on the season. While they lost the semifinal to MIT, Cornell recovered in the consolation game for a 3rd-place finish. The result of the tournament showed, if nothing else, that Cornell wasn't nearly as bad as the BC game may have indicated, they just hadn't gotten their skating legs. As if to further illustrate that point, Cornell had a rematch with Colgate a week after the Lake Placid Invitational. While they still lost to the Red Raiders, the score was a much more respectable 1–3. Cornell continued to improve as the season went on, ending the week with their third win against St. Lawrence. Warm weather forced the game to be shortened to 50 minutes but the Big Red were able to produce five goals in that span.\nThe next game for Cornell was originally scheduled for the 27th of January, however, the game had to be postponed because it would have taken place during the exam period for Syracuse University. The Orange game was eventually played, occurring after both schools had finished with their semester exams, and ended up giving Cornell their 4th win of the season. With several games remaining on their schedule, the Big Red were one away from posting the second most wins in program history and the most since winning the intercollegiate championship in 1911. The team wanted to get ready for their next match against Army, however, weather again became a problem and melted the ice on Beebe Lake to the point where the team couldn't get in any training time. They fought hard against the Cadets, forcing the game into overtime, but ultimately fell 3–4.\nCornell's next match was supposed to be a third meeting with Colgate. Unfortunately, the ice on Beebe Lake was still too soft and the game was called off. The lack of practice time caught up to Cornell in their penultimate match when Hamilton knocked the team down and prevented Cornell from a chance at a winning season. Cornell was able to end its season on a high note, shutting out Syracuse in the rematch at the end of February. Despite finishing with a losing record, the Big Red would not win as many games in a season for over 20 years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\"| \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Paul Bitok (born 1974) is a Kenyan volleyball player and coach who leads the women's national team in Rwanda. He is the head coach of the Kenya women's national volleyball team which qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics, although before their first match, Brazilian coach was announced as Kenya's head volleyball coach.\nLife.\nBitok was born in Simat in Uasin Gishu County to a sporting family. He grew to be two metres tall and he was encouraged at Kapsabet High School to play basketball with the possibility of playing for an American team. Bitok preferred volleyball as there were fewer rules and it could be played with basic equipment. His hometown of Simat did not have basketball facilities but volleyball had a local following. Many of the national players came from Simat. When he was nineteen he was playing in the national league and he went to work as a bank clerk for the Kenya Commercial Bank as he played for their volleyball team.\nHe was the first Kenyan volleyball player to be employed by a foreign team. He was playing in Tunisia in 2003 and he later moved to play in Croatia. He returned to Kenya where he stopped playing but he was still involved in sports administration. In 2005 he returned to the Kenya Commercial Bank as their chief volleyball coach. The team was fourth in the national league, but the following year they were the best team in Africa and he was asked to be an assistant coach to Sadatoshi Sugawara for Kenya's national team. This was a step up and in 2008 he was headhunted by Rwanda to be their national coach, but he turned down the offer to go to Budapest to learn more about sports coaching. With his new expertise, he returned to Rwanda where he introduced training from an early age. Camps were established in the provinces where young players could be developed. When he returned in 2020 Rwanda had teams competing internationally in every age category and the national team were the champions of Africa.\nIn January 2020 he was named \"Coach of the Year\" at the Mombasa Sports Club during the SOYA awards.\nUnder Bitok's leadership, Kenya's women's volleyball team the Malkia Strikers won the gold medal at the African Games and they qualified for the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics which was the first time in sixteen years. The chosen players' names were revealed on 26 June 2021. Bitok chose the veteran Mercy Moim as captain and veteran Jane Wacu also made the team, but former players Violet Makuto and Elizabeth Wanyama were not included. The team received additional coaching from six Brazilian coaches who visited Kenya and the team was then sent to Nairobi where they received additional coaching from the Brazilian coach . The other teams in their group are the home teams of Japan, Serbia, Brazil, Korea, and the Dominican Republic.\nThe team was waved away from Nairobi by President Uhuru Kenyatta for the Olympics in Tokyo. They travelled in three batches to try and minimise the chances of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. They would train for two weeks in Kurumu city but Bitok lost three days of training due to the phased arrival. The team's opening match was on July 25 in Tokyo against Japan. Surprisingly Bitok was not at the match's touchline, as Luizomar de Moura was announced as Kenya's head volleyball coach. De Moura spoke to the press via the team manager. The team lost their first match against Japan in straight sets.\nPrivate life.\nBitok is married to Jennifer Jelagat Bitok and they have two daughters and a son."

The team was led by 12th-year head coach Fran McCaffery and played its home games at Carver–Hawkeye Arena as members of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 26–10, 12–8 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for fourth place. The 26 wins were the most wins in a season for Iowa since the Elite Eight team in 1986–87 earned 30 wins. As the No. 5 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they defeated Northwestern, Rutgers, Indiana, and Purdue to win the tournament championship. As a result, the Hawkeyes received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament and drew the No. 5 seed in the Midwest region. Despite winning 9 of its previous 10 games and boasting the second-best efficiency margin in Division 1 between February 1 and the start of the tournament, the Hawkeyes were upset by No. 12-seeded Richmond in the first round.\nSophomore forward Keegan Murray earned consensus First-team All-American honors, and established a new school record for points in a season. It was the third consecutive season that an Iowa player was selected a consensus First-team All-American and set a new school record for points in a season (Luka Garza, 2019–20 and 2020–21).\nPrevious season.\nIn a season limited due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Hawkeyes finished the 2020–21 season 22–9, 14–6 in Big Ten play to finish in third place. They defeated Wisconsin in the quarterfinal round of the Big Ten tournament before losing to Illinois in the semifinals. The Hawkeyes received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 2 seed in the West region. They defeated Grand Canyon in the first round before losing to Oregon in the second round, ending their chances at their first Sweet Sixteen since 1999. Iowa spent all but two weeks of the season ranked in the top 10 of the AP poll and ended with a No. 8 ranking.\nSenior center Luka Garza was named Big Ten Player of the Year and a consensus All-American for the second consecutive season. He was also named the consensus National Player of the Year and ended his career with a school-record 2,306 points (seventh in Big Ten history). After his last home game in a Hawkeye uniform, it was announced that his No. 55 jersey would be retired. Senior guard Jordan Bohannon ended the season with school-records of 639 assists and 364 three-point field goals (second in Big Ten history).\nOffseason.\nReturning players.\nSenior guard Jordan Bohannon announced on April 26 that he would return to Iowa taking advantage of the extra year of eligibility from the NCAA due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRoster.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nSource\nRankings.\n^Coaches did not release a Week 1 poll."

It will be played at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany, on 31 May 2025. This will be the first UEFA Champions League final played under the new format of the Swiss-system.\nThe winners will earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup.\nVenue.\nThis will be the second UEFA Champions League final hosted at the Allianz Arena; the first was held in 2012. Overall, it will be the fifth European Cup final to be held in Munich, with the 1979, 1993, and 1997 finals taking place at the Olympiastadion. The final will also be the ninth to take place in Germany, having also taken place in Stuttgart in 1959 and 1988, Gelsenkirchen in 2004, and Berlin in 2015, equalling the record of nine European Cup finals held in Italy and Spain. The Allianz Arena previously hosted matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was chosen as a host venue for UEFA Euro 2020 and UEFA Euro 2024.\nHost selection.\nOn 16 July 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul would host the 2023 UEFA Champions League final instead of Munich. This was due to the fact that Istanbul twice had the Champions League final intended for their city relocated owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally planned as hosts for the 2020 final, the match was moved to Lisbon and the final hosts shifted back a year, with Istanbul instead awarded the 2021 final. However, weeks prior to the final, the 2021 fixture was moved to Porto due to travel restrictions.\nMunich, originally selected to host the 2022 final by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 24 September 2019, was later planned to host the 2023 final after the shifting of the final hosts. However, the city was awarded the 2025 final instead after being bumped from 2023 by Istanbul.\nMatch.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) will be determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "Minor League Cricket",
        "text": "Minor League Cricket (branded as the Sunoco Minor League Cricket championship for sponsorship reasons, and sometimes shortened to MiLC) is an American Twenty20 cricket developmental league for Major League Cricket which completed its first season in 2021, after it was delayed from a mid-to-late 2020 start due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It consists of 26 teams from four regions. The league began its regional draft process in late-August 2020, and a series of exhibition games in September 2020. The draft for the league began on June 4, 2021. The Strikers won the inaugural finals against the New Jersey Stallions by six wickets, with the Thunderbolts winning the 2022 finals against the Atlanta Fire by ten runs.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nTalks of an American Twenty20 league started in November 2018, just before USA Cricket became the new governing body of cricket in the United States. In May 2021, USA Cricket announced they had accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a $1 billion investment covering the league and other investments benefitting the U.S. national teams.\nIn an Annual General Meeting on February 21, 2020, it was announced that ACE was planning to launch its professional T20 league Major League Cricket in 2021, and a developmental league, Minor League Cricket that summer. USA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins stated that ACE had \"demonstrated an understanding of the importance of addressing various fundamental issues within the domestic game in the United States\", and listed a number of metropolitan areas that the developmental league planned to target for franchises.\nBoth leagues would be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with Minor League Cricket being delayed to 2021, and Major League Cricket provisionally postponed to 2022 (in May 2021, Major League Cricket would be further-delayed to 2023 due to both the pandemic, and the need to develop more facilities). Minor League Cricket would still soft launch in 2020 with an exhibition league; the draft for the exhibition league began on August 22, 2020, with the teams releasing their squads on August 24.\n2021.\nAfter the conclusion of the exhibition league, USA Cricket announced that they were planning to launch the inaugural season of Minor League Cricket in the spring of 2021. The season launched on July 31, 2021, and ran until October 3, 2021, where the Silicon Valley Strikers won the finals against the New Jersey Stallions by six wickets to win the inaugural season title. The sanctioning body announced plans to establish women's leagues in the future.\nIn February 2021, MLC announced plans for a youth version of Minor and Major League Cricket, as part of a pathway to give young cricketers the opportunity to play for official domestic teams and the national team. In June 2022, MLC announced the inaugural season of the Minor League Cricket Youth Tournament (shortened to MiLC Youth), with UST tapped as title sponsor for the tournament. The inaugural season of MiLC Youth was announced to be contested between 11 teams at the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston starting July 25, 2022. The finals for the inaugural season took place on July 29 at between the Dallas Mustangs and the New Jersey Stallions, in which the Stallions beat the Mustangs by two wickets.\n2022.\nIn January 2022, USA Cricket announced that the 2022 Minor League Cricket season would start on June 25, and conclude with the final on August 28. The 2022 finals were won by the Seattle Thunderbolts, who beat the Atlanta Fire by ten runs to win their maiden MiLC title. It was also announced in June 2022 that the budget for the 2022 season was more than $5 million.\n2023.\nAmid a dispute with USA Cricket, tournament directors pushed for a June 10 start to the 2023 season of Minor League Cricket. However, this was pushed back to August 4, a week ahead of the conclusion of the 2023 Major League Cricket season. The season saw the discontinuation of two franchises, as well as the renaming of two other teams amid managerial shakeups. The season concluded on October 1, with the Dallas Mustangs defeating the NJ Somerset Cavaliers by 44 runs. All matches played during the season were played on either real grass or hybrid wickets.\nIn June, MiLC signed a deal with Cricket Canada and Boundaries North to help grow the game in the country through the potential formation of around 4-6 teams based in the area. MiLC announced that they were looking into the British Columbia and Greater Toronto Areas for expansion as soon as the 2024 season.\n2024.\nThe 2024 season is expected to be played following the conclusion of the 2024 Major League Cricket season, sometime in August.\nCurrent teams.\nUnlike Major League Cricket, Minor League Cricket uses privately owned franchises. American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) announced 24 teams and their owners on August 15, 2020. On June 3, 2021, ACE added three more teams. Additionally, the teams are part of two \"conferences\", which are each split into two \"divisions\". This consists of the Pacific Conference, split into the Western and Central divisions, and the Atlantic Conference, which is split into the Eastern and Southern divisions.\nLeague structure.\nTeams in each division will play anywhere from 14 to 16 games in the league stage. Once the league stage is completed, the top two teams in each division will advance to the quarterfinals, wherein the top team in each division will face the second-placed team in the other division of their conference for a best-of-three series. The remaining games will be regular knockout matches, with the semifinals sending one team from each conference to the final. The official schedule and the venues of the playoffs was released on September 20, 2021, by Major League Cricket.\nThe inaugural season of Minor League Cricket had a total prize pool of $250,000, the highest ever in American cricket. This was increased to $350,000 for the 2022 season, $150,000 of which went to the tournament champions, the Seattle Thunderbolts.\nMedia.\nMatches are streamed by Major League Cricket on its YouTube channel and the streaming platform FanCode."

The team has no geographical base, instead being made up of some of the best players from across India. The side has won the 50 over Challenger Trophy three times.\nHistory.\nIndia Red were first formed in 2008, as India Senior, to compete in the inaugural edition of the 50 over Senior Women's Challenger Trophy, a triangular tournament with teams made from the best players in India. Jhulan Goswami was announced as the captain for the opening season. They started their season disappointingly by losing against India A by 31 runs, in the inaugural match of the tournament. Although they won their next match against India B, they did not qualify for the final and finished bottom of the league.\nIn the following season, the team were renamed to India Red and competed in the 2009–10 Senior Women's T20 Challenger Trophy, where they again finished bottom of their group. 2010–11 saw a return to the 50 over format, with Reema Malhotra as the team captain. The side once again finished bottom of the league, with no wins. India Red saw improvement in the next season, as they clinched the tournament title for the first time by defeating India Blue by 41 runs.\nThey also qualified for the final in the next three seasons playing against the same opponent, but lost each time. They lost by 60 runs in the 2012–13 season, while in the following season, they lost thrillingly by 8 runs. Smriti Mandhana captained the India Red in the 2015 season, as the team won every match of the group stage before losing in the final.\nThe 2016–17 season saw India Red regain their title, beating India Blue in the final by 7 wickets helped by 62* from Mandhana. After again finishing bottom of the group in 2017–18, the side reached the final of both the 50 over and returning 20 over tournaments, winning the 50 over title but losing the 20 over title. In 2019–20, the 50 over Challenger Trophy was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the T20 Challenger Trophy was competed with different teams."

        "text": "The equestrian statue of William III in Cathedral Square, Glasgow, is a 1735 work by an unknown sculptor.\nDescription.\nThe bronze sculpture depicts William III of England in Roman attire mounted on a horse. It is said that the tail of the Glasgow statue is designed to move to prevent it being broken by means of a ball and socket joint. In front of the plinth is a plaque that reads \"In commemoration of the Tercentenary of the Glorious Revolution of 1688-89\". The statue is a A listed building.\nHistory.\nThe statue was financed by James Macrae in 1735 and erected in front of Tontine Hotel in Trongate. Although the sculptor is unknown a similar statue of William III by Peter Scheemakers was erected one year earlier in Hull. In 1897, due to the statue obstructing traffic it was moved to a traffic island in front of the new Glasgow Cross railway station. In 1923, the statue was put in storage. In 1926, it was moved to Cathedral Square where it remains to this day.\nIn June 2020, following the actions against memorials in Great Britain during the George Floyd protests, the statue was graffitied, William III having been connected to the Royal African Company and Edward Colston.\nIn May 2021, the statue was damaged after the horse's tail was broken off. The Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland said the vandalism was due the \"continued demonisation and stigmatisation of all things Protestant and Unionist\" and that it only encourages \"vile vandalism and attacks on Glasgow’s historical and architecturally renowned statues.\""

The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 17th season.\nSeason.\nCornell's season began with an early-season tournament at the Jack Shea Arena in Lake Placid. The team was forced to pay their own way to get to the cite and, due to several players living too far away during the Christmas break, the Big Red were handicapped before the games were even played. The meet took place between seven colleges but and was advertised as a 'practice tournament'. At the time the term was typically used to refer to games that would not be considered for rankings; in modern terminology, the games would have been non-conference rather than exhibition matches.\nDespite being on ice for only half a dozen sessions, Cornell opened the tournament with a bang, throttling St. Lawrence 11–1. After defeating the ordinarily powerful Hamilton Continentals in the second game, Cornell finished their otherwise successful appearance with a narrow loss to Williams. Cornell was set to face Colgate immediately after returning from the break, however, rain and warm weather forced the match to be cancelled.\nThe lack of practice time degraded the team's effectiveness. When they travelled to play Clarkson, the Big Red were overpowered 1–9. While the defense would put forth a better effort in the team's final two games, the offense remained dormant and Cornell ended the year on a 4-game losing streak. Cornell had scheduled a match against Columbia in late January, their last chance for a home game, but the Lions ended up cancelling their entire season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\"| \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2022 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2022 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2021–22 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeated the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics in six games, winning their fourth championship in eight years. Golden State's Stephen Curry was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the first time in his career.\nThe 3-seeded Warriors (53–29) had home-court advantage in the series based on having the better regular-season record than the 2-seeded Celtics (51–31). This is the 11th time that a lower-seeded team had home-court advantage, the last time being 2019. It is also the second straight finals without a no. 1 seed from either conference, as well as the 15th time overall. The Celtics won the opening game on the road and returned to Boston with the series tied 1–1. They won their first home game to take a 2–1 lead, but the Warriors won the next three games to take the series 4–2. Golden State won their first title since 2018 and their seventh championship overall, while Boston remained tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most titles in league history with 17.\nThe NBA Finals returned to its normal June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began. The series started on June 2 and concluded on June 16. Sponsored by the streaming service YouTube TV, the series was officially known as the 2022 NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV. This edition of the Finals was a rematch of the 1964 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then-San Francisco Warriors in five games.\nBackground.\nBoston Celtics.\nDuring the 2021 offseason, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens president of basketball operations, replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement. Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, a 2021 first-round pick, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for Al Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick. Needing a replacement for Stevens, Brooklyn Nets assistant coach Ime Udoka was hired as the new head coach. After starting the season 16–19 and in 10th place in the Eastern Conference standings, the Celtics finished the regular season with a record of 51–31, winning 35 of their final 47 games to finish with the second-best record in the conference.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics won in a four-game sweep over the seventh-seeded Brooklyn Nets, with numerous experts expecting a more competitive series as the Nets, with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and initially James Harden before he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, were seen as the preseason favorites. The Celtics then faced the 2021 Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and defending champion Milwaukee Bucks, going down 3–2 in the series before eventually winning the series in seven games. After going down 2–1 in the conference finals against the first-seeded Miami Heat led by Jimmy Butler, the Celtics won in seven games, reaching the Finals for the first time since 2010 and for the 22nd time in their history.\nThis marked the first time a team from the Greater Boston area reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 2019, when the Boston Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals.\nGolden State Warriors.\nAfter reaching the Finals for five consecutive seasons (2015–2019), the Warriors were struck with injuries for the next two seasons, with Klay Thompson sitting out for the entire 2019–20 and 2020–21 campaigns, and Stephen Curry playing a combined 68 games during that time span. In 2021–22, Golden State began the season winning 18 of their first 20 games. Curry became the NBA career leader in 3-pointers, and Thompson returned on January 9, 2022, his first NBA game in 941 days. Andrew Wiggins, acquired by the Warriors in 2020 after six seasons with Minnesota, was named a starter for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game. The Warriors finished as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference with a record of 53–29,\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors got past the sixth-seeded Denver Nuggets and 2022 league MVP Nikola Jokić in five games, with Curry coming off the bench in four of the five games after he returned from a foot injury. The Warriors then eliminated the second-seeded Memphis Grizzlies and the 2022 NBA Most Improved Player, Ja Morant, beating them in six games. After defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the conference finals, the Warriors advanced to the Finals for the first time in three seasons, the sixth time in eight seasons, and the twelfth time in franchise history.\nThis marked the first time a team from the Bay Area reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 2020, when the San Francisco 49ers reached Super Bowl LIV.\nRoad to the Finals.\nNotes\nRegular season series.\nThe Warriors and Celtics tied the regular season series 1–1, with the away team winning each game.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nAfter playing 141 playoff games without an NBA Finals appearance, Al Horford helped lead the way for Boston with 26 points, including going on an 8–0 run by himself to give his team the lead in the fourth quarter as the Celtics outscored the Warriors 40–16. Jaylen Brown also helped spark a 17–0 run in the fourth, scoring 10 of his 24 points in the final quarter. Jayson Tatum had a poor shooting performance, going 3-for-17 from the field and scoring 12 points, but he finished with a career-high 13 assists, the most ever for a player in his Finals debut. Boston's other four starters shot 30-for-50 (60%) in the game, along with shooting 12-for-23 (52%) from beyond the arc, as the Celtics hit their first seven three-point attempts in the fourth. Marcus Smart added 18 points, and Derrick White came off the bench to score 21 points.\nFor the Warriors, Stephen Curry got off to a hot start, scoring 21 points and shooting 6-for-8 from beyond the arc in the first quarter, the most three-pointers made in a single quarter in Finals history. In addition, the 21 points were the most in a single quarter since Michael Jordan's 22 in the fourth quarter of Game 4 in 1993. However, Curry struggled for the rest of the game, shooting 5-of-16 in the final three quarters as the Warriors blew a 92–80 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Despite collecting 11 rebounds, Draymond Green shot just 2-for-12 from the field and 0-for-3 on free throws, fouling out with a minute to go in the fourth.\nThe Celtics' comeback was the biggest in the Finals after three quarters since the Chicago Bulls overcame a 15-point deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 6 in 1992. The win also brought the Celtics record to 8–2 on the road this postseason, while the Warriors dropped to 9–1 at home. Both teams also made a combined 40 three-pointers, the most ever in an NBA Finals game, surpassing the previous record of 35 set in 2017.\nGame 2.\nCurry scored 29 points and Golden State outscored Boston 35–14 in the third quarter to tie the series with a 107–88 win. The Warriors outscored the Celtics 43–14 from late in the second quarter to early in the fourth, transforming a tie game into a blowout. Jordan Poole added 17 points for Golden State, including a 3-point shot from , just past midcourt, with only seconds left in the third quarter, giving them a 23-point lead. Boston committed 19 turnovers, which the Warriors converted into 33 points.\nGreen had nine points, five rebounds, and seven assists for Golden State, but impacted the game with his aggressiveness on defense and physical play. He forced a jump ball on Horford 13 seconds into the game, and he was the primary defender on Brown, holding him to 5-of-17 shooting. Tatum recovered from his poor shooting in Game 1, scoring 21 points in the first half of Game 2 on 7-of-16 shooting. Brown added 15 points in the first half, but Boston still trailed by two at halftime. In the third quarter, Tatum shot just twice in the third period, even though he played all 12 minutes. Horford scored just two points on four shots in the game after scoring 26 in the opener. The Celtics made just 37.5% of their shots in the game, scoring their fewest points since December 29, when they were 16–19.\nThe Warriors' Andre Iguodala missed the game due to inflammation in his right knee. Teammate Gary Payton II, who played for the first time since fracturing his elbow one month ago in their series against Memphis, scored seven points in 25 minutes.\nGame 3.\nBrown scored 27 points and Tatum had 26 in a 116–100 Boston win for a 2–1 series lead. The Celtics led by as many as 18 points in the first half, but Golden State again surged in the third quarter, outscoring Boston 33–25 behind 15 points from Curry. The Warriors briefly took the lead at 83–82, but the Celtics were back up at 93–89 at the end of the period. Boston outscored Golden State 23–11 in the fourth quarter. The Celtics were the more physical team, outscoring the Warriors 52–26 in the paint and outrebounding them 47–31. Boston's Robert Williams III had 10 rebounds and four of the team's seven blocks.\nCurry finished with 31 points and six 3-pointers, and Thompson added 25 points and five 3s made. Green was held to two points, four rebounds, and three assists before fouling out for the second time in the series. He became the first player in Finals history to foul out after playing at least 34 minutes with less than five points, five rebounds and five assists. Curry was injured late in the fourth when Horford fell on his leg while chasing a loose ball. Green received his sixth foul, which ejected him from the game when he pushed a Celtic from the pile; Green said Curry was howling in pain at the bottom of the pileup. The following day, Curry was confident that he would play in Game 4, saying that it was \"just a pain tolerance thing that you've got to deal with.\" He said it was not as bad as the injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season when Boston's Smart rolled over his foot when they went for a loose ball.\nGame 4.\nCurry scored 43 points and had 10 rebounds in a 107–97 win to even the series 2–2. He made two baskets during a 10–0 run for the Warriors in the fourth quarter, turning a four-point Boston advantage into a 100–94 lead for Golden State. He played 41 minutes and made 14 of 26 shots in the game, including 7 of 14 on 3-pointers. Andrew Wiggins added 17 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for the Warriors, who outrebounded Boston in the game, 47–31, including 15–6 on the offensive end.\nGolden State changed their starting lineup, replacing Kevon Looney with Otto Porter Jr. Curry and the Celtics' Tatum each scored 12 points in the first quarter, which ended with a 28–27 lead for Boston. Brown scored 10 points in the second quarter, giving the Celtics a 54–49 lead at halftime. There had been six lead changes in the game at that point, along with five ties. Curry scored 14 in the third for 33 going into the fourth. The teams were tied at 86 with eight minutes remaining. Boston led 94–90 with about five minutes left, but scored just once more, with 1:18 left. Golden State outscored them 17–3 to end the game, with Curry alone outscoring them 10–3.\nCurry became the third Warriors player with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds in a Finals game, joining Rick Barry (1967), and Kevin Durant (2018). He also joined Jordan and LeBron James as the only players age 34 or older to score 40 or more points in an NBA Finals contest. Green scored two points on 1-of-7 shooting, but added nine rebounds, eight assists and four steals. Golden State head coach Steve Kerr benched him for parts of the fourth quarter, while Looney remained on the floor for his rebounding—11 in 28 minutes, along with a plus–minus of +21. The Warriors were down four points with around seven minutes remaining when Green was pulled, and they went on an 11–3 run over the next four minutes before he returned. With his offensive struggles, he alternated offensive and defensive possessions with Poole. Tatum finished with 23 points and 11 rebounds, but he made only one basket while playing the entire fourth quarter. Brown scored 21 points, and Williams had 12 rebounds for the Celtics.\nGame 5.\nWiggins had 26 points and 13 rebounds to lead Golden State to a 104–94 victory, placing them within a game of a championship. Thompson added 21 points to help the Warriors overcome an off night for Curry, who had 16 points and eight assists but went 0 for 9 from 3-point range. Boston was more aggressive in double-teaming Curry beyond the 3-point line. Prior to Game 5, he had NBA-record streaks of 38 consecutive games with multiple 3-pointers, 132 straight playoff games with a least one 3-point basket, and 233 consecutive games with a 3-pointer in the regular season and postseason combined. Tatum had a game-high 27 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who lost consecutive games for the first time in these playoffs.\nThe Warriors led by as many as 16 points in the first quarter. Boston whittled away at the lead with Curry on the bench, but he made a layup to give Golden State a 51–39 advantage at halftime. Wiggins had 16 points and seven rebounds at the break, and Green was forceful with 8 points after totaling just 17 in the first four games. The Warriors were moving the ball well but shot just 3 for 17 on 3-pointers in the first half. Tatum had 13 points and eight rebounds to keep Boston in the game. After the break, the Celtics scored the first 10 points of the second half and took the lead after a 19–4 run. They made eight consecutive 3s after missing their first 12 of the game, while Golden State missed their first eight in the second half. Poole banked in a three-pointer to beat the third-quarter buzzer, giving the Warriors a 75–74 lead to enter the fourth.\nThompson shot 7 for 14 and made five 3-pointers. The Warriors were 9 of 40 on their 3s, including 0 of 6 from Wiggins. Green, who fouled out with 3:01 left, exited with eight points, eight rebounds, and seven assists. Golden State got 15 points off the bench from Payton and 14 from Poole. Boston shot 11 of 32 from behind the arc, with Brown going 0 for 5 and shooting 5 of 18 overall; he finished with 18 points. Williams had 10 points and eight rebounds.\nGame 6.\nComing into the game, Golden State was 0–3 in closeout games on the road, and the Celtics were 3–0 when facing elimination. Boston took a 14–2 lead to start the game, but they made just one basket in the final 3:30 of the first quarter, and Golden State led 27–22 at the end of the period. The Warriors forced 12 turnovers in the first half and used a 21–0 run to take a 54–39 halftime lead. The 21–0 run was the longest such run in modern Finals history. They expanded their lead to 22, before the Celtics rallied to trail 76–66 after three quarters. Golden State maintained their lead through the fourth quarter to win the game 103–90 for their fourth NBA title in eight seasons. This was the second time that a road team won an NBA championship in Boston, the other being the Los Angeles Lakers in 1985.\nCurry scored 34 points in the game, shooting 12-of-21 overall and 6-of-11 on 3-pointers, and added seven rebounds, seven assists, and two steals. He was voted the Finals MVP for the first time in his career, unanimously selected after averaging 31.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 5.0 assists in the series. He scored 30 or more points in three consecutive games in Boston, the first player to do so in the playoffs since LeBron James in 2017. Green scored 12 points on 5-of-10 shooting, grabbing 12 rebounds, recording eight assists with two steals and two blocks. He also hit two 3-pointers after missing his first 12 attempts of the series. For head coach Steve Kerr, he won his ninth championship overall, after winning five as a player. He became the sixth coach to capture four titles, joining Phil Jackson, Red Auerbach, John Kundla, Gregg Popovich and Pat Riley. The Warriors also became the first team to go from the NBA's worst record (2019–20) to a championship within a three-season span. With the win, the Warriors earned their seventh double-digit comeback win this postseason, which tied the 2011 and 2012 Miami Heat for the most double-digit comeback wins by any team in the past 25 postseasons.\nBrown led the Celtics with 34 points but Tatum finished with just 13, shooting just 6-of-18 from the field. The Celtics' bench also performed poorly, receiving just five points on 2-for-10 shooting from the field from their primary reserves—White, Grant Williams, and Payton Pritchard. Boston also committed 22 turnovers, dropping to 1–8 this postseason when committing 16 or more. Tatum set the NBA record for most turnovers in a single postseason with 100. The Celtics' Finals series record dropped to 17–5, remaining tied with the Lakers for the most championships in league history.\nPlayer statistics.\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; background:#FDE910\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\nRedesigned logo and trophy.\nOn April 13, the NBA released a reimagined version of the classic NBA Finals wordmark that was used between 1986 and 1995 and from 2004 to 2017. The new logo also features a depiction of the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in the background.\nThe NBA then announced on May 12 that the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Trophy have also been redesigned. Among the new changes to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, its base now consists of two disks that list the names of all the previous winning teams. The Bill Russell Trophy has been changed from a gold ball and silver net to primarily gold with silver accents.\nWith NBA commissioner Adam Silver missing games 5 and 6 due to the league's health and safety protocols, the Larry O'Brien Trophy was presented to the Warriors by deputy commissioner Mark Tatum instead.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Finals was televised in the United States by ABC (which included local affiliates WCVB-TV in Boston and KGO-TV in San Francisco) for the 20th consecutive year.\nLead play-by-play announcer Mike Breen and lead analyst Jeff Van Gundy both missed Game 1 due to COVID-19 protocols. ESPN's No. 2 play-by-play announcer, Mark Jones, filled in for Breen during games 1 and 2. Jones, Mark Jackson and Lisa Salters made history in Game 1 as the first all-African American broadcast team to cover an NBA Finals game. Van Gundy returned to the broadcast booth for Game 2, followed by Breen in Game 3.\nESPN put together a Megacast option for Game 1 called \"NBA Finals: Celebrating 75\", hosted by Michael Eaves alongside New Orleans Pelicans guard CJ McCollum and Tim Legler. It was broadcast on ESPN2 due to ESPN's commitments to have the Women's College World Series on the main network."

        "text": "The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the alpine skiing events at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nQualification rules.\nQuotas.\nA maximum of 306 athletes are allowed to compete at the Olympic Games. A maximum of 22 athletes per nation will be allowed to compete with a maximum of 11 males or 11 females from a nation being permitted. A nation may not enter more than four athletes in any single event. Each nation may also enter a maximum of one team in the Mixed Team Parallel event.\nTo qualify a nation must have at least one athlete meet basic eligibility requirements of age, medical fitness, and be under the prescribed maximum points on the FIS points list that takes into account results from July 1, 2019, to January 16, 2022. The Points List is calculated by taking the average of five best event results for technical events (giant slalom and slalom) and two best results for speed events (downhill, super G, and super combined). To compete in giant slalom or slalom an athlete must have a point average of less than 160 in those disciplines. To compete in downhill or super G an athlete must have a point total less than 80 disciplines. To compete in super combined an athlete must have a point average less than 160, but a point average of less than 80 in downhill.\nOn January 24, 2022, the IOC granted four extra male quotas while the FIS began investigating the legitimacy of some low level qualifying events.\nAllocation of quotas.\nEvery NOC will be assigned one male and one female quota spot meeting the minimum basic standards.\nThe host nation (China) is awarded an additional quota per gender, granted all athletes meet the standard above.\nEvery NOC with at least one male and/or female in the top 30 of any event will be allocated one additional male and/or female quota in addition to the basic quota. If an athlete is ranked in the top 30 in more than one event a second additional quota for that sex will be given or if two different athletes are in the top 30.\nThe remaining quotas will be assigned using the Olympic Quota allocation list on 16 January 2022. The spots will be assigned until a maximum of 306 quotas are reached including the above. When a nation reaches its maximum, remaining athletes from that country will be skipped over. The list is a table of athletes in the top 500 in their two best events (including both male and female athletes). These additional quotas are gender specific, and will be used to create a maximum of 153 male and 153 female competitors.\nAn athlete can be counted only once for the above criteria. For example, if a country has only one athlete meeting all three criteria then only one quota will be given (not 3).\nThe top 16 nations in the overall FIS World Cup Nations Standings as of 17 January 2022 will permitted to enter a team of two male and two female athletes in the mixed team event. If China is not among the top 16, then the top 15 along with China will qualify. In the event one of these nations have only 3 quota spots earned above then they will be awarded a fourth quota to allow them to participate in the team event in addition to the prescribed total of 306.\nQualification summary.\n\"As of 30 January 2022.\"\nNext eligible NOC per event.\nA country can be eligible for more than one quota spot per event in the reallocation process. A strike through indicates the NOC refused, bolded NOCs accepted a reallocation. NOCs that had already refused a quota are omitted. Only the reallocation process and the next five eligible NOCs are shown."

The rankings at the start of 2021/2022 season are determined by prize money earned in the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2021/2022 season, all of the points from the 2020/2021 season, and the points from the 2019/2020 season that have not yet been dropped.

        "text": "The 1935–36 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 29th season of play for the program. The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 14th season.\nSeason.\nOnce again, the ice hockey team was forced to wait until some time in January before they could practice on Beebe Lake. The team got as much training in as they could and met Union for the first game of the season. The Big Red had to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the 3rd to tie the game and no overtime was played to determine the winner.\nCornell had to wait until after the semester break for the second match and they welcomed a familiar face to Ithaca in Colgate. The two played a closely-contested affair but, while Guthrie was sitting in the penalty box, the Red Raiders nabbed the winning goal. Howard \"Curly\" Dugan played the entire game on defense while brother Sam netted both Big Red goals. A week later the team hit the road and met stiff opposition in the form of Hamilton. The team played well but the offensive attack from the Continentals was just too much for them to handle.\nThe final game of the season was played against Syracuse after St. Lawrence cancelled its appearance. Several changes to the lineup resulted in Cornell earning its only win on the year. Simpson led the way with a hat-trick while the defense was manned aptly by the Dugan brothers.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2022 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2021–22 season. The playoffs began on May 2, 2022, one day after the regular season ended, and concluded on June 26, 2022, with the Colorado Avalanche winning their third Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to two in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nWith the Government of Canada allowing cross-border travel for fully vaccinated players and team personnel between Canada and the United States, the league was able to return to its usual two conference, four division alignment. As a result, the standard 16-team playoff format that was used before the COVID-19 pandemic from 2014–2019 was reinstated.\nThe Florida Panthers made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. This was the final season of the Pittsburgh Penguins' 16-season playoff streak, the longest active streak in the four major North American professional sports leagues at the time. Three of the semifinalists from the previous season (the Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders and Vegas Golden Knights) failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Los Angeles Kings ended a two-year run in which no teams from California qualified for the playoffs. All eight playoff teams from the Eastern Conference finished the season with at least 100 points, marking the first playoffs in NHL history in which all eight teams in a single conference qualified with at least 100 points.\nFlorida's opening round series victory over the Washington Capitals was their first series win since the 1996 Eastern Conference finals. This postseason marked the third time that the league played 50 or more games in the opening round of the playoffs since this round was changed to a best-of-seven format in 1987. The first round featured five game sevens, the most in a single playoff round since 1992, when there were six game sevens in the division semifinals. On May 15, for the first time since 1997, and the second time in League history, both game sevens went into overtime. With their conference final series victory, the Tampa Bay Lightning became the third team in league history to win at least eleven consecutive playoff series; joining the Montreal Canadiens (1976–1980) and New York Islanders (1980–1984) in accomplishing this feat.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the seventh year and first since 2019, in which the top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams compete in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage plays at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team is at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference. \nIn the first round, the lower seeded wild card in each conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed. In the conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better regular season record.\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (WC2) Washington Capitals.\nThe Florida Panthers earned the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team with 122 points. Washington finished as the Eastern Conference's second wild card, earning 100 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Florida won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Panthers defeated the Capitals in six games and won their first playoff series since 1996. In game one, the Capitals overcame a one-goal deficit in the third period and gained the lead at 10:37 on T. J. Oshie's goal to win 4–2. Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe both scored a goal and provided an assist in the Panthers' 5–1 victory in game two. Ilya Samsonov made 29 saves for the Capitals in game three, outscoring the Panthers 6–1 and taking a 2–1 series lead. Verhaeghe scored twice in game four, including the overtime-winning goal for the Panthers, tying the series up 2–2 in a 3–2 triumph. In game five, Verhaeghe scored twice and assisted on the other three Panthers’ goals in Florida's three-goal comeback, taking the game 5–3 to lead the series 3–2. In game six, Claude Giroux scored a goal and provided two assists and Verhaeghe scored the overtime goal in a 4–3 victory sending the Panthers to the second round for the first time in 26 years.\n(A2) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs finished second in the Atlantic Division, earning 115 points. The Tampa Bay Lightning earned 110 points to finish third in the Atlantic Division. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Maple Leafs in seven games. In game one, Maple Leaf's forward Auston Matthews provided two goals and an assist in Jack Campbell's 24-save 5–0 shutout. Victor Hedman had a goal and three assists for the Lightning in game two, giving Tampa Bay a 5–3 victory. In game three, Pierre Engvall provided three assists for the Maple Leafs, staving off a potential comeback from Tampa Bay and winning 5–2. In game four, the Lightning got off to a quick start, scoring three goals within the first eight minutes of the game en route to a 7–3 victory. The Maple Leafs came back from a 2–0 deficit in Game 5 with William Nylander providing a goal and two assists in a 4–3 victory. In game 6, although the Maple Leafs came back from a two-goal deficit, the Lightning's Brayden Point scored in overtime to extend the series to a seventh game in a 4–3 affair. In game 7, Nick Paul scored twice while the Lightning defended their 2–1 lead onto the victory and a second round advancement. With their game seven loss, the Maple Leafs lost eight consecutive playoff series and ten potential series-clinching games. After Florida won a playoff series for the first time since 1996, Toronto held the NHL's longest active playoff series win drought, as they last won a playoff series in 2004.\n(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (WC1) Boston Bruins.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes finished first in the Metropolitan Division earning 116 points. Boston finished as the Eastern Conference's first wild card earning 107 points. This was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with Boston winning five of the six previous series. They last met in the 2020 Eastern Conference first round, which Boston won in five games. Carolina won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Hurricanes defeated the Bruins in seven games, with the home team victorious in every game. Antti Raanta made 35 saves in game one, backstopping the Hurricanes in a 5–1 victory. Upon Hurricanes forward Nino Niederreiter's two goals and Pyotr Kochetkov's 30 saves in relief of Raanta in game two, Carolina gained 2–0 series lead by defeating Boston 5–2. In game three, Brad Marchand scored a goal and provided two assists in the Bruins' 4–2 victory. In game four, Marchand scored or provided an assist on every Bruins goal in Boston's 5–2 victory, tying the series 2–2. In game five, Seth Jarvis scored twice and Teuvo Teravainen assisted thrice in the Hurricanes 5–1 victory, taking a 3–2 series lead in the process. In game six, Charlie Coyle and Marchand each scored a goal and provided an assist in the Bruins' 5–2 victory tying the series 3–3. Max Domi scored twice and added an assist in game seven, granting Carolina a 3–2 victory and an advancement to the second round.\n(M2) New York Rangers vs. (M3) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThe New York Rangers finished second in the Metropolitan Division with 110 points. The Pittsburgh Penguins earned 103 points to finish third in the Metropolitan Division. This was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams with Pittsburgh winning five of the seven previous series. They last met in the 2016 Eastern Conference first round, which Pittsburgh won in five games. New York won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Rangers came back from a 3–1 series deficit to defeat the Penguins in seven games. In game one, although Igor Shesterkin made 79 saves for the Rangers, Penguins forward Evgeni Malkin scored for Pittsburgh at 5:58 of triple overtime to win 4–3. In game two, Artemi Panarin and Frank Vatrano both scored a goal and provided two assists in the Rangers' 5–2 victory. In game three, although the Rangers tied the game after being down 4–1, Penguins forward Danton Heinen's goal proved to be the game-winning goal at 11:02 of the third period giving Pittsburgh a 7–4 victory. The Penguins scored five times in the second period of game four, chasing goalie Shesterkin in a 7–2 rout. In game five, the Rangers successfully came back from a two-goal deficit to win 5–3, forcing a sixth game. Chris Kreider gave the Rangers a lead late in the third period of game six, giving his team a 5–3 victory and tying the series 3–3. In game seven and the subsequent overtime, Panarin scored for New York sending the Rangers to the second round with a 4–3 victory. This marked the first time the Penguins lost a game seven on the road in franchise history after winning the previous six instances. The Rangers equalled both the Montreal Canadiens and Vancouver Canucks for most comebacks from a 3–1 series deficit with three. The Rangers also became the first team in Stanley Cup playoff history to record three consecutive comeback wins in elimination games within the same series.\nWestern Conference first round.\n(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (WC2) Nashville Predators.\nThe Colorado Avalanche finished first in the Central Division and Western Conference earning 119 points. The Nashville Predators earned 97 points to finish as the Western Conference's second wild card. This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 2018 Western Conference first round, which Nashville won in six games. Nashville won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Avalanche defeated the Predators in a four-game sweep. Colorado scored five times in the first period of game one, forcing Nashville to switch goalies in a 7–2 affair. In game two, the Avalanche shot 51 times at Predators' goalie Connor Ingram and at 8:31 of overtime, Cale Makar scored to give Colorado a 2–1 victory. Gabriel Landeskog scored and assisted twice in game three, helping the Avalanche obtain both a 7–3 victory and 3–0 series lead. In game four, Andre Burakovsky's goal and two assists helped lift the Avalanche to a 5–3 victory, advancing to the second round.\n(C2) Minnesota Wild vs. (C3) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Minnesota Wild finished second in the Central Division earning 113 points. The St. Louis Blues earned 109 points to finish third in the Central Division. This was the third playoff meeting between these teams with the teams splitting the two previous series. They last met in the 2017 Western Conference first round, which St. Louis won in five games. St. Louis won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blues defeated the Wild in six games. In game one, Ville Husso made 37 saves for the Blues and David Perron scored a hat trick in St. Louis' 4–0 victory. The Wild returned with a hat trick of their own in game two when Kirill Kaprizov scored Minnesota's first playoff hat trick in a 6–2 victory. Marc-Andre Fleury made 29 saves for the Wild in game three, backstopping Minnesota into a 5–1 victory. Blues captain Ryan O'Reilly scored a goal and two assists in game four, leading St. Louis to a 5–2 victory.

In the extra period, Calgary forward Johnny Gaudreau scored to give the Flames a 3–2 victory and a second round advancement. In the loss, Oettinger became the second goalie since 1955 to post 60 or more saves in a seventh game.\n(P2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (P3) Los Angeles Kings.\nThe Edmonton Oilers finished second in the Pacific Division with 104 points. The Los Angeles Kings earned 99 points to finish third in the Pacific Division. This was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams with Edmonton winning five of the seven previous series.

Edmonton won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Oilers defeated the Kings in seven games. In game one, Phillip Danault's goal with 5:14 left in the third period proved to be the game-winning goal for the Kings who edged the Oilers 4–3. Mike Smith stopped all 30 shots in game two, ending his ten-game playoff losing streak with a 6–0 shutout victory. The Oilers dominated game three, forcing Los Angeles to switch goalies and giving Evander Kane a hat trick in the process of an 8–2 rout. Jonathan Quick claimed a 31-save shutout in game four, backstopping the Kings to a 4–0 victory. In the process, he became the leading United States-born goalie in playoff shutouts with 10. In game five, the Oilers came back from a two-goal deficit to tie the match; however, Kings forward Adrian Kempe's overtime goal, his second score of the affair, gave Los Angeles the 5–4 victory and a 3–2 series lead. In game six, Connor McDavid scored a goal and provided two assists in the Oilers' 4–2 victory, forcing a seventh game in Edmonton. In game seven, McDavid scored and assisted in a 2–0 victory as they advanced to the second round.\nSecond round.\nEastern Conference second round.\n(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the second consecutive and the second overall playoff meeting between these two rivals. Tampa Bay won the previous year's Stanley Cup first round series in six games. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Panthers in a four-game sweep. In game one, Corey Perry and Nikita Kucherov both scored a goal and assisted in Tampa Bay's 4–1 victory. Ross Colton's goal with 3.8 seconds left in game two provided Tampa Bay with a 2–1 victory and a 2–0 series lead. Kucherov scored a goal and assisted three times in the Lightning's 5–1 victory of game three, who took a 3–0 series lead in the process. In game four, Andrei Vasilevskiy made 49 saves in a 2–0 shutout, advancing the Lightning to the Conference finals for the third consecutive season. With their victory, they became the first team since the 1980–1984 New York Islanders dynasty to win ten consecutive playoff series and they equalled the 1956–1960 Montreal Canadiens in consecutive series victories.\n(M1) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (M2) New York Rangers.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 2020 Eastern Conference qualifying round, which Carolina won in a three-game sweep. Carolina won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Rangers defeated the Hurricanes in seven games. After Sebastian Aho tied the game late for Carolina in game one, Ian Cole scored in overtime to give the Hurricanes a 2–1 victory. In game two, Aho scored a goal and provided an assist in Antti Raanta's 21 save shutout for the Hurricanes' 2–0 victory. The Rangers rebounded in game three; aided by Igor Shesterkin's 43 saves, New York defeated Carolina 3–1. In game four, Andrew Copp notched a goal and two assists in the Rangers 4–1 victory, evening the series 2–2. The Hurricanes shot 34 times at Shesterkin in game five, banking in three goals for a 3–1 victory and a 3–2 series lead. In game six, Shesterkin made 37 saves and Filip Chytil scored twice for the Rangers who defeated Carolina 5–2 to force a seventh game. New York shut the door on Carolina in game seven, outscoring the Hurricanes 6–2 to advance to the conference final for the first time since 2015.\nWestern Conference second round.\n(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (C3) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the second consecutive playoff meeting and the third overall between these two teams with Colorado winning both previous series. Colorado won the previous year's Stanley Cup first round series in a four-game sweep. Colorado won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Avalanche defeated the Blues in six games. In game one, the Avalanche poured 51 shots at Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington, however, the final shot in overtime by defenceman Josh Manson gave Colorado a 3–2 victory. David Perron scored twice in game two and with Binnington stopping 30 shots, St. Louis won 4–1. Binnington was injured and knocked out of the remainder of the series in the first period of game three, and Artturi Lehkonen scored twice for the Avalanche, as Colorado downed the Blues 5–2 for a 2–1 series lead. In game four, Nazem Kadri scored a hat trick and provided an assist in the Avalanche's 6–3 victory. Game 5 featured a wild scoring affair as the Avalanche had gained a three-goal lead and lost it, but banking off Nathan MacKinnon's hat trick goal with 2:46 remaining in the third period, Colorado retrieved a one-goal lead. St. Louis managed to tie the game again, and in the subsequent overtime period, Tyler Bozak scored to give the Blues a 5–4 victory. In game six, Darren Helm's goal with 5.6 seconds remaining proved to be the series-winning goal for Colorado, who advanced to the Conference final for the first time since 2002.\n(P1) Calgary Flames vs. (P2) Edmonton Oilers.\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two rivals with Edmonton winning four of the five previous series. They last met in the 1991 Smythe Division semifinals, which Edmonton won in seven games. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Oilers defeated the Flames in five games. Game one was an offensive outburst on both sides with a total of fifteen goals, the most in a playoff game within the Battle of Alberta. The Flames who reached a 6–2 lead had that advantage disappear as the Oilers tied the game; however, two of Matthew Tkachuk's hat trick goals sealed the victory for Calgary in a 9–6 affair. The Oilers successively overcame a two-goal deficit in game two with Leon Draisaitl providing a goal and two assists in a 5–3 victory. The Oilers line of Evander Kane, Connor McDavid, and Draisaitl dominated the second period of game three with Kane scoring a natural hat-trick, Draisaitl assisting four times, an NHL playoff record, and McDavid assisting three times, leading to an eventual 4–1 victory. In game four, the Flames tied the game after being down by three goals; however, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins's second goal broke the tie for Edmonton, scoring with 3:37 left in the game to lead the Oilers to a 5–3 victory and a 3–1 series lead. Game five was mainly a back-and-forth affair, with exception to the two-goal comeback by the Oilers. During the second period, Calgary and Edmonton combined to score four goals in 1:11, setting an NHL record for the fastest four goals in a playoff game. During the third period, Calgary had a late goal by Blake Coleman disallowed after video review determined that the puck was kicked into the net. With the game tied at the end of the third period, both teams headed to overtime where McDavid scored to send Edmonton to the Conference final for the first time since 2006.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(M2) New York Rangers vs. (A3) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams. The Rangers made their seventh semifinals/conference final appearance since the league began using a 16-team or greater playoff format in 1980. They lost their most recent appearance in the 2015 Eastern Conference final, also the most recent playoff meeting between these two teams, in seven games to Tampa Bay. This was Tampa Bay's third consecutive and eighth overall semifinals/conference final since entering the league; they're the first team to accomplish this feat since the 2015 Chicago Blackhawks. They won the previous year's semifinals against the New York Islanders in seven games. New York won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Rangers in six games. Filip Chytil scored twice for the Rangers in game one, who defeated Tampa Bay 6–2. In game two, Igor Shesterkin made 29 saves for the Rangers in a 3–2 affair which ended the Lightning's 18-game win streak after losing the prior game. The Lightning recovered in game three, coming back from a 2–0 deficit, and with Ondrej Palat's goal with 42 seconds left in the game, Tampa Bay defeated New York 3–2. In game four, Palat scored a goal and provided two assists in goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy's 34 save performance to defeat New York 4–1 and tie the series 2–2. Palat continued his late-goal antics into game five, scoring with 1:50 left in the third period to lead the Lightning to a 3–1 victory and a 3–2 series lead. In game six, the captain Steven Stamkos scored twice to give the Lightning a 2–1 victory and a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals for the third consecutive season.\nWestern Conference final.\n(C1) Colorado Avalanche vs. (P2) Edmonton Oilers.\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams with both teams splitting the two previous series. They last met in the 1998 Western Conference quarterfinals, which Edmonton came back from a 3–1 series deficit to win in seven games. This was Colorado's ninth appearance in the Conference Final. They were defeated in seven games by the Detroit Red Wings in their most recent conference finals appearance in 2002. Edmonton made their tenth appearance in the conference finals. Their most recent appearance was in the 2006 Western Conference final, which Edmonton won against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in five games. Colorado won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Avalanche defeated the Oilers in a four-game sweep. In game one, the Avalanche held off a potential four-goal comeback with an empty net goal to win 8–6. During the game, Cale Makar's goal appeared to be offside due to Valeri Nichushkin still needing to exit the offensive zone, however, the goal was deemed onside with Makar pushing the puck across the blue line and not in possession until Nichushkin became onside. Pavel Francouz stopped all 24 shots he faced in game two and with Nazem Kadri's three assists, Colorado won 4–0. In game three, Nichushkin's two goals helped Colorado obtain a 4–2 victory and a 3–0 series lead. In game four, the Avalanche came back from a two-goal deficit to take the lead, but the Oilers tied the game and it went to overtime. In overtime, Artturi Lehkonen scored to send Colorado to the Finals for the first time since 2001.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Colorado made their third Finals appearance. They last appeared in the Finals in 2001, which Colorado won against the New Jersey Devils in seven games. This was Tampa Bay's third consecutive Finals appearance and fifth overall; they were the first team to appear in three consecutive Finals since the 1985 Edmonton Oilers. They won the previous year's finals against the Montreal Canadiens in five games. Colorado won both games in this year's regular season series.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points, following the conclusion of the playoffs.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision and radio.\nIn Canada, for the eighth postseason under Rogers Media's 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast by Sportsnet networks and CBC Television under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service NHL Live. For first and second round U.S. vs. U.S. games not on CBC, Sportsnet generally simulcasted the U.S. feed instead of producing their own telecast.\nIn the U.S., this marked the first Stanley Cup playoffs under the NHL's 7-year broadcast rights deals with ESPN and TNT; during the First Round, games aired across ESPN, ESPN2, TBS, and TNT. For the second round onward, the games aired on either ESPN or TNT (except for one second-round game which aired on ESPN2 due to \"Sunday Night Baseball\" airing on ESPN). Other ESPN and Turner channels (such as ESPNU, ESPNews, and TruTV) continued to be used in the event of overflow situations. As before, each U.S. team's regional broadcaster televised local coverage of games during the First Round, after which all other games were exclusive to the ESPN networks and TNT.\nIn assigning broadcasters for each game, the NHL had to work around the 2022 NBA playoffs (which share ESPN and TNT as rightsholders, and started ahead of the Stanley Cup playoffs), ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\", and other such conflicts. In general during the first round, ESPN or ESPN2 aired games on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (including all Game 5's), and TNT or TBS broadcast games on Thursdays and Fridays (including all Game 6's). Monday and weekend first round games were split between ESPN/ESPN2 and TNT/TBS, ensuring that both broadcasters televised two of the first four games in each series, and at least two of the five Game 7's. With the NBA Conference Finals occurring at the same time with the Stanley Cup second round this year, ESPN ended up being the \"de facto\" exclusive broadcaster for the Carolina–NY Rangers and Calgary–Edmonton series, and TNT doing the same for the Florida–Tampa Bay and Colorado–St. Louis series. Both conference finals also aired exclusively on ESPN and TNT; under the new contracts, ESPN held the first choice of which conference final to air, opting for the Eastern Conference this postseason. As per the new alternating rotation, ABC exclusively aired the Stanley Cup Finals.\nUnlike past seasons, there was no coverage of playoff games on U.S. broadcast television until the Stanley Cup Finals (previous rightsholders such as NBC had traditionally offered weekend games on broadcast television during the early rounds), as ESPN had prioritized the carriage of NBA playoff games on broadcast television via ABC instead. Conversely, the Finals were carried in their entirety on broadcast television for the first time since 1980 (which was aired primarily by the Hughes Television Network, but with CBS acquiring the rights to the series-deciding Game 6 as a one-off \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" broadcast); Since then, the Finals were either partially or exclusively carried on cable. There were no live games on over-the-top streaming services until the third round, as ESPN+ only streamed simulcasts of the Eastern Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Finals, and Turner Sports did not invoke its option to carry or simulcast games on HBO Max.\nAmerican national radio rights to select Stanley Cup playoff games, including the entire conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals, were broadcast on the Sports USA Radio Network via NHL Radio. This was the first of a four-year deal signed between the NHL and Sports USA to syndicate NHL games on U.S. national radio."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India in September 2022 to play three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches as a preparatory series before 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. They later returned in February and March 2023 to play four Test and three One Day International (ODI) matches. The Test matches formed part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship.\nAustralia won the first T20I by 4 wickets, to lead the series 1–0. The second T20I was reduced to 8 overs per side due to a wet outfield, with India winning the match by 6 wickets. India won the third and final T20I by 6 wickets to win the series 2–1.\nIndia won the Test series 2–1, and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Australia's win in the third Test secured their place in the World Test Championship final. Results in other matches confirmed that India also qualified for the Championship final after the drawn fourth Test.\nIndia won the first ODI by 5 wickets, to lead the series 1–0. But Australia won the second ODI by 10 wickets, to level the series 1–1. Australia won the third ODI by 21 runs and won the series 2–1.\nPrime Minister of India Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese at Narendra Modi stadium on the first day of the fourth test at the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event. The event was organized as a tribute to the 75 years of diplomatic and cricket relations between two the countries. The two PMs visited the \"Hall of fame\" museum inside the stadium.\nScheduling.\nIn August 2022, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed the schedule for the T20Is. On 8 December 2022, the BCCI confirmed the schedule for the Tests and the ODIs.\nOn 13 February 2023, BCCI confirmed the venue of third test was shifted from Dharamshala to Indore. The ground was rated \"poor\" by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and received three demerit points. However on 27 March 2023, ICC changed the rating to \"below average\", and the ground received one demerit point, after an appeal by the BCCI.\nSquads.\nBefore the start of T20I series, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc and Marcus Stoinis were ruled out due to injuries, and were replaced by Sean Abbott, Nathan Ellis and Daniel Sams. India's Mohammed Shami was ruled of the T20I series due to COVID-19, with Umesh Yadav named as his replacement.\nOn 10 January 2023, Mitchell Starc was ruled out of the first Test against India due to finger injury. On 1 February 2023, Shreyas Iyer was ruled out of the first Test against Australia due to back injury. On 5 February 2023, Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the first Test against India due to achilles niggle in his left leg. On 7 February 2023, Cameron Green was ruled out of the first Test against India due to fractured finger. Ahead of the second Test, Matthew Kuhnemann replaced Mitchell Swepson in Australia's squad. On 12 February 2023, Jaydev Unadkat was released from India's squad for second Test, to play Ranji Trophy Final. On 20 February 2023, Australia's Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of Test series. Mitchell Swepson re-joined the squad prior to the third Test. On 21 February 2023, Australia's David Warner was ruled out of the last two Tests due to elbow injury. On 22 February 2023, Ashton Agar was released from Australia's squad for last two Tests, to play Sheffield Shield and Marsh One-Day Cup. Pat Cummins was unavailable for the last two Tests due to a family emergency, with Steve Smith named as captain.\nOn 19 February 2023, BCCI confirmed that Rohit Sharma would be unavailable for the first ODI due to family commitments, with Hardik Pandya named as the captain in his place. On 6 March 2023, Australia's Jhye Richardson was ruled out from the ODI series due to a hamstring injury, with Nathan Ellis named as his replacement. On 14 March 2023, Pat Cummins left the ODI squad due to family problems, with Steve Smith named as the captain in his absence. On 14 March 2023, Shreyas Iyer was ruled out of the ODI series due to recurrence of back injury.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nWith the pitch seeming likely to favour spinners, India played three spinners, while Australia played two, giving Murphy his debut. Australia also dropped Head, in a decision which was widely criticised in Australia, replacing him with Handscomb. So the Indian team was Sharma, Rahul, Pujara, Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav (batters), Bharat (wicket-keeper), Ashwin, Jadeja, Patel (spin bowlers), Shami and Siraj (fast bowlers); and the Australian team was Khawaja, Warner, Labuschagne, Smith, Handscomb, Renshaw (batters), Carey (wicket-keeper), Lyon, Murphy (spin bowlers), Cummins and Boland (fast bowlers).\nDespite a modest first-innings total of 177, Australia's position looked reasonable when India were 168 for 5, despite Sharma going on to make 120. But Jadeja (70) and Patel (84) gave India a large lead. The Australia were then bowled out in their second innings for 91, appearing to have no answer to India's spinners, who took 16 wickets between them for the match."

        "text": "The equestrian statue of Robert the Bruce at the Bannockburn Visitor Centre, Bannockburn, Stirling, is a 1964 work by Pilkington Jackson.\nDescription.\nThe bronze sculpture depicts Robert the Bruce wielding an axe and on a war horse. The statue stands on a plinth that bears the inscription \"ROBERT THE BRUCE \nKING OF SCOTS 1306–1329\". It is located near the site of the Battle of Bannockburn. The statue is a A listed building.\nHistory.\nThe statue was commissioned by the Earl of Elgin in 1964 to commemorate the 650th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn. It was sculpted by Pilkington Jackson using the measurements of Bruce's skull, re-discovered at Dunfermline Abbey in 1818, and cast in Cheltenham by H.H. Martyn &amp; Co. The statue was unveiled by the Queen.\nIn 1966, a replica of the statue was placed outside the Alberta University of the Arts in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The statue was funded by Canadian lawyer Eric Harvie.\nFrom 2009 to 2020, the statue featured on the Clydesdale Bank £20 note.\nIn 2013, the statue was restored in preparation for the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn in 2014. The statue which was cast in bronze was slowly turning green. Culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said \"The Robert the Bruce statue is an iconic part of the Bannockburn site, and a poignant reminder of the battle\".\nOn 11 June 2020, following the actions against memorials in Great Britain during the George Floyd protests, the statue was defaced with graffiti. The Scottish king was branded as a racist, despite not being involved in the slave trade. Stirling MP Alyn Smith said “I’ve been vocal in my support of #BlackLivesMatter and hope such counterproductive stupidity is an isolated incident.”"

The bid was first announced by the football federations of Portugal and Spain on 7 October 2020, with Morocco joining on 14 March 2023. On 4 October 2023, Morocco, Portugal and Spain were chosen as the host countries for the 2030 FIFA World Cup over the South American bid, with Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay being selected to host three inaugural matches on the occasion of the centenary of the 1930 World Cup. It will be ratified by the FIFA Congress in Late 2024.\nBackground.\nSpain has previously hosted the FIFA World Cup finals in 1982, while Portugal and Morocco have never hosted the tournament. All three countries have hosted the finals of their continental tournaments once – Spain in 1964, Portugal in 2004 and Morocco in 1988. Spain and Portugal had previously submitted an unsuccessful joint bid to host the FIFA World Cup in either 2018 or 2022. FIFA's rules for rotating the tournament between continents made UEFA members, including the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) ineligible to bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nThe regulations for the 2030 World Cup bidding process were announced in the second quarter of 2022, with applications being accepted from June that year and the host to be officially selected at the 74th FIFA Congress in 2024. With regulations remaining the same as those for the 2026 World Cup, football federations from Asia (AFC) and North America (CONCACAF) will be ineligible to host following the successful Qatar 2022 and United 2026 bids respectively. The tournament will mark the centenary of the first FIFA World Cup which was hosted by Uruguay; several other national football federations across Europe, South America and Africa have expressed interest in bidding to host the tournament.\nAnnouncement.\nThe FPF and RFEF jointly announced their intentions to bid for the tournament during a goalless friendly match between the two countries' national teams on 7 October 2020. Before another goalless friendly between the two teams on 4 June 2021 (which also marked the centenary of Portugal's first international fixture, against Spain) the agreement to jointly support a bid was formalised. The respective presidents of the RFEF and FPF, Luis Rubiales and Fernando Gomes, ratified the agreement on behalf of their respective federations. Also in attendance to support the bid were King of Spain Felipe VI, President of Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Portugal António Costa, as well as multiple government ministers and officials from both countries.\nAddition of Morocco as co-host.\nOn 5 October 2022, the FPF and RFEF held a joint press conference on their 2030 World Cup bid at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. RFEF president Rubiales and FPF president Gomes were joined by Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF) president Andriy Pavelko, announcing that Ukraine would join the bid, despite the Russian invasion of the country. On 29 November, \"The Guardian\" reported that the Ukrainian part of the bid was \"likely dead\" after Pavelko was arrested on suspiscion of embezzelment. \nIndependently of the Spain–Portugal bid, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced in mid-2018 that it would seek to host the tournament. It was Morocco's sixth bid to host the FIFA World Cup, after unsuccessful attempts in 1994, 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2026. On 14 March 2023, King Mohammed VI of Morocco announced that the country would instead join the Spain–Portugal bid as a co-host. Although the Royal Spanish Football Federation did not immediately confirm the addition, the prime ministers of Spain and Portugal both welcomed Morocco's decision to join the bid. On 1 April 2023, the \"Kyiv Post\" reported that Spain and Portugal ultimately decided against going with Ukraine for the bid, \"presumably\" to avoid bringing attention to \"Ukrainian corruption\".\nOn 27 September 2023, Morocco was selected as the host of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations. On 4 October 2023, the FIFA Council unanimously approved Spain, Portugal and Morocco as the sole bids for the tournament.\nMajor sports events hosting experiences.\nSpain, Portugal and Morocco have all hosted various major sporting events, including:\nVenues.\nOn 14 July 2022, the Royal Spanish Football Federation unveiled a shortlist including 15 stadiums in Spain. It was decided 11 Spanish stadiums will be selected with three Portuguese ones for the Spain–Portugal 2030 FIFA World Cup bid but when Morocco joined the bid there is a possibility that Spain will select 6 or 7 stadiums.\nOn 22 June 2023, the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa revealed the list of cities and stadiums that Morocco will present as part of the candidacy file to host the 2030 World Cup in a joint file with Spain and Portugal, as it was decided that 6 stadiums will be selected over 6 cities, of which 5 were previously built and will undergo a number of renovations.\nMarketing.\nThe organising committee for the 2030 FIFA World Cup bid slogan, \"Yalla Vamos 2030\", and visual identity was unveiled on 19 March 2024. This dynamic phrase featured prominently in the official logo of the 2030 World Cup bid, along with a vibrant depiction of the number 30 surrounding the football with the sun and the sea. Symbolizing the year of the tournament, the number was artfully incorporated with colors inspired by the flags of the three host countries. The bid is under the slogan: \"Yalla Vamos 2030\" meaning \"Let's Go\" in Arabic (Yalla), Portuguese and Spanish (Vamos), captures the essence of unity and excitement for the upcoming event. "

        "text": "Michael Golden is an American retired ice hockey forward who was an All-American for the University of Maine.\nCareer.\nGolden was a star player for Reading Memorial High School in Massachusetts, leading his team to a Middlesex League championship while scoring nearly three points per game. The Edmonton Oilers ended up selecting him in the second round of the 1983 NHL Entry Draft and he began attending the University of New Hampshire in the fall. Golden's tenure in Durham lasted just seven games and he left mid-season to play for both a junior-B team and at the World Junior Championships.\nGolden ended up transferring to Maine and was forced to sit out the entire 1984–85 season due to NCAA requirements. He debuted for the Black Bears the following year and slowly worked his way to the top of the roster. Golden helped the team reach their first NCAA Tournament in 1987 and was named team captain for his senior season. 1988 was a new high for the program as they finished first in the Hockey East standings with Golden finishing second on the team and sixth in the nation in scoring. Maine received the top eastern seed in 1988 and won their quarterfinal match to make the program's first Frozen Four.\nWhile he was in college, Golden had been traded by the Oilers to the New York Rangers in a package that included Reijo Ruotsalainen. He began his professional career in the Rangers' farm system and played well for two years. His scoring diminished in 1991 as he moved between three teams and he retired as a player following the year.\nGolden returned home and hung around his old high school team, eventually joining as a volunteer assistant. He left for a few years after the turn of the century but returned as the head coach for the women's team in 2009. He built the team into a power in short order, leading the team to its first state championship in 2015 with a record of 22–2–0. Work commitments unfortunately forced him to resign from his position following the year but Golden had already left an indelible mark on the school."

        "title": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club racism scandal",
        "text": "The Yorkshire County Cricket Club racism scandal developed from complaints made in 2018 by former Yorkshire cricket player, Azeem Rafiq. Rafiq alleged that he was subjected to racist abuse and bullying during his two tenures at the club between 2008–2014, and 2016–2018 and accused the club of being institutionally racist. He complained officially in 2018, but an independent inquiry was not launched until 2020, leading to criticism of Yorkshire County Cricket Club (YCCC) for its handling of the affair. The chairperson resigned in November 2021, being replaced by Kamlesh Patel. Two former England players have been alleged to have used racist language whilst playing for the club.\nBackground.\nYorkshire County Cricket Club started an investigation in September 2020 into claims that Azeem Rafiq made regarding racist comments made towards him during his tenure at YCCC between 2008–2014, and 2016–2018. Rafiq stated that the racism he encountered while at the club, reduced him to tears and left him close to suicide.\" The YCCC commissioned an independent law firm to investigate the accusations. This panel consisted of five members, three of whom were BAME representatives. The report they delivered was reviewed by an independent panel, and recommendations were made. However, it has been acknowledged that as far back as 2017, Rafiq complained to the YCCC about racial slurs directed at him and he formalised these comments into an official complaint in 2018, but an inquiry was not launched until 3 September 2020.\nWhen the allegations became public, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan came out in support of Rafiq stating he also was subjected to racist abuse while at the club, an allegation which the YCCC described as \"very concerning\". Naved stated as \"a foreigner\", he knew he would not be staying in the UK to live, and so did not wish to raise the issue as he felt it might affect his contract with the club.\nReport.\nYCCC received the independent report in August 2021, which is believed to have cost £50,000. One of the players named in the report, Gary Ballance, admitted that he used \"racial language\" toward Rafiq on nights out, and that he \"deeply regrets\" his actions. However, he said that he and Rafiq were \"best friends\" who used inappropriate language with each other. The report classed the ethnic slur used by Ballance against Rafiq as \"friendly banter\", which brought a lot of criticism from politicians and campaign groups.\nOf the 43 complaints submitted by Rafiq, the report upheld seven complaints. These were:\nRafiq alleged that in 2009, during a county match against Nottinghamshire, Vaughan said while referring to a number of players of Asian descent that there \"...are too many of you lot. We need to do something about it.\" A statement also remembered by other players present.\nThe panel that assessed the report found that YCCC \"failed to implement its policies and procedures\" in relation to the complaints raised by Rafiq, and their subsequent handling of those complaints. On the assumption of a new chairperson, Lord Kamlesh Patel on 8 November 2021, he promised to release the full unredacted report to all interested parties.\nCriticism.\nThe Independent Panel's report was released to Yorkshire County Cricket Club on 13 August 2021. YCCC released a statement on 19 August 2021 offering profound apologies to Rafiq, but the report remained unreleased. The sitting MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, demanded that the report be released immediately in its entirety, noting that it had taken three years to get to the report being delivered.\nA summary report was released by YCCC on 10 September 2021 which upheld seven out of 43 claims of racism made by Azeem Rafiq. The full report was not published for legal reasons (\"in relation to privacy law and defamation\"). On 28 October 2021, YCCC released a statement stating that \"\nThe Club has also carried out their own internal investigation following the findings in the Report after which they are able to report that they have come to the conclusion that there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or Executives that warrants disciplinary action.\" \nRafiq replied on social media \"Wow just when you think this club couldn't get more embarrassing you find a way. Still awaiting the FULL report. Thanks for mentioning the people that have provided your PROTECTION &amp; given green light to RACISM[sic].\"\nThe former chairperson of the YCCC, Roger Hutton, complained that he had no support from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Hutton was quoted as saying that he \"...immediately reached out\" to the sport's governing body after becoming aware of Rafiq's allegations, but that the ECB had been \"reluctant to act\" and \"declined to help\". The UK government also questioned whether or not the ECB was \"fit for purpose\" over its handling of the affair.\nIn response, the ECB stated that \"Our role is to operate as a regulator across the entire game. We must act independently of any club investigations, should we ever be required to intervene as regulator - either during or after. The reason why our governance is structured in this manner, is perfectly demonstrated in the way that these issues have played out at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.\"\nHutton himself was criticised in the press for not giving any interviews about the scandal, and was accused of \"..[hiding] behind bland, reactive, mostly ill-judged statements...\". Hutton was installed as chairperson in 2020 and so was not present at the club for the period that Rafiq was. As a consequence, the two have spoken on the phone, but not actually met in person. Hutton was seen as the only non-involved member who could be a focal point for media, the other senior members of the YCCC hierarchy were subject to the report, so would not be allowed to talk to the press. In an opinion-piece written by Simon Heffer in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Hutton was described as one of the few people who; \"..[have] ..emerge[d] from this story with any credit.\" (in relation to his resignation and apology to Rafiq). Like Hutton, Heffer criticised the ECB, describing their reactions and responses to the scandal \"pitiful and pathetic.\"\nFallout.\nOn 4 November 2021, the ECB condemned the response of the YCCC, and suspended them from hosting international matches. This would have financial implications not only for the club, but also for local businesses who would see a loss of trade from those matches. Similarly, several sponsors of the YCCC (Nike, Tetley's, Yorkshire Tea, David Lloyd Clubs, and Harrogate Spring Water), cut their ties with the club. Emerald Publishing withdrew their support too; previously the ground had been called the \"Emerald Headingley Stadium\".\nAs a result of the pressure and criticism of the club, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid MP, the Health Secretary, and other senior members of the Conservative Party at least three people resigned their posts, with a fourth person to follow. Roger Hutton, chairman of YCCC, resigned on 5 November 2021, Although he joined YCCC two years after Rafiq left, his tenure was during the inquiry process. He stated in his resignation letter: \"The club should have recognised at the time the serious allegations of racism. I am sorry that we could not persuade executive members of the board to recognise the gravity of the situation and show care and contrition.\"\nAllegations of racist comments also surfaced involving Michael Vaughan, who was a team-mate of Rafiq's at Yorkshire in 2009. The BBC announced that his run on the BBC Radio 5 Live programme \"Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show\" would be temporarily halted as the show should remain impartial. The following week's show (due to be broadcast on 8 November 2021) would have discussed the fallout from the YCCC scandal. Ballance, who is still an active cricketer, has been banned from being selected to play for the English cricket team.\nAzeem Rafiq noted that he was receiving continued abuse for speaking out.\nIt was announced on 5 November 2021 that Kamlesh Patel would be taking over as the chairperson of YCCC. At his first press conference on 8 November 2021, he announced that he had taken four immediate steps: settling the employment tribunal with Rafiq (including the cessation of any demands for an NDA (non-disclosure agreement)), setting up an independent whistleblowing hotline, setting up a review into procedures and policies at YCCC, and pledging to share the full report with all interested parties including the ECB, Rafiq and MPs.\nBesides Rafiq and Naved, a further two former players came forward to state that they had been subject to racist slurs whilst playing at the club. It also emerged that staff at the YCCC had been sent grim reaper images on social media and had their tyres slashed whilst parked at the club.\nOn 9 November 2021, the club announced that its head coach, Andrew Gale, was suspended following an historic tweet from 2010 which had included what the BBC called an \"anti-Semitic slur\". The tweet had been sent at the time Gale was captain of the club and Rafiq a player, but was not in reference to Rafiq or any of his allegations and had been deleted once Gale had been made aware that it was offensive. On the same day the club announced that Martyn Moxon, their director of cricket, was absent from work due to stress; Rafiq had called for Moxon and Mark Arthur, the club's Chief Executive Officer, to resign. On 3 December 2021, Moxon and Gale were removed from their posts at the club, with a total of sixteen members of staff being removed from their roles. Gale subsequently issued a statement challenging Rafiq's allegations.\nOn 16 November 2021, the Parliamentary DCMS Committee heard evidence from Azeem Rafiq, former YCCC chair Roger Hutton, and English and Wales Cricket Board CEO Tom Harrison along with other board executives. Current YCCC Chair Lord Patel who was watching the hearing from the public gallery was also invited to address MPs. The Chair, Julian Knight MP, commended Azeem's \"bravery in speaking out\", acknowledged \"the terrible impact on him and his family\", and noted that it was \"deeply disappointing that YCCC was unable to provide anyone with executive authority to give evidence to the Committee\". The Chair also noted that the Committee had \"taken the decision not to publish YCCC’s report on its investigation and believe the onus remains with the club to do so.\" The Committee also published Azeem Rafiq's witness statement from his Leeds employment tribunal.\nIn July 2022, Kunwar Bansil, the former Yorkshire physiotherapist who was among those removed from their job, stated that he had not witnessed any racism.\nThe Parliamentary DCMS held a further evidence session on 13 December 2022, at which George Dobell (cricket journalist); Lord Patel of Bradford (Chair, Yorkshire County Cricket Club), Jahid Ahmed (former Essex County Cricket Club cricketer) and Azeem Rafiq appeared. Azeem Rafiq also submitted written corroborating evidence to the Committee as part of his testimony."

        "text": "Jacob Timothy Bird (born December 4, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball for the UCLA Bruins, and led the Pac-12 Conference in earned run average in 2018. He was selected by the Rockies in the fifth round of the 2018 MLB draft and made his MLB debut in 2022.\nEarly life.\nBird was born in Newhall, California, to Joel and Heidi Bird, was raised in Valencia, California, and is Jewish. His paternal grandmother was Jewish and his mother is Catholic. He has one older brother, Josh, and two younger brothers, Travis and Trent.\nWhen Bird was eight years old, at the end of second grade he signed his friends' yearbooks as follows: \"Save this autograph for when I’m playing in the major leagues.\"\nHigh school.\nBird attended West Ranch High School in Stevenson Ranch, California, pitching and playing outfield for the baseball team, and playing for the basketball team. In his senior year of high school he pitched to a 1.55 ERA with 72 strikeouts and 11 walks over 58 innings. He was an All-Foothill League selection in 2014. He committed to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to play college baseball for the UCLA Bruins during his senior year.\nCollege.\nUnselected in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, he enrolled at UCLA, majoring in economics. In 2016, Bird played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League, going 3–2 with a 2.77 ERA as a starter. As a junior he was 5–5 with a 2.75 ERA. His pitching repertoire consisted of a heavy sinker that reached 94 mph, a hard slider in the 86-88 mph range, a changeup, and a curveball.\nAs a senior at UCLA in 2018, Bird compiled a 7–4 record and started 16 games, leading the Pac-12 Conference with a 2.18 ERA, and striking out 61 batters over innings. He said: \"I'm just trying to pitch contact. My stuff is pretty heavy ... which gets a lot of ground balls... (Just) let the defense do their thing.\" He was named All-Pac-12, Pac-12 All-Academic first team, and Academic All-America third team. Following the season, he was selected by the Colorado Rockies in the fifth round of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft.\nProfessional career.\n2018-21.\nBird signed with the Rockies for a signing bonus of $50,000. He made his professional debut in 2018 with the Grand Junction Rockies of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, going 4–1 with a 3.38 ERA and 30 strikeouts over innings pitched in relief. In 2019, he played with the Asheville Tourists of the Class A South Atlantic League, with whom he earned mid-season All-Star honors. He went 7–2 with two saves and a 3.62 ERA and 80 strikeouts in 40 games (second in the league) over 97 innings.\nTo begin the 2021 season, he was assigned to the Hartford Yard Goats of the Double-A Northeast, where Bird induced a 70.9% ground ball rate. He was then promoted to the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Triple-A West in early June. Over 39 appearances between the two clubs, Bird went 6–1 with a 3.38 ERA and 59 strikeouts over innings. He pitched as a reliever in the Arizona Fall League for the Salt River Rafters after the season, and was 0–1 with a save and a 2.84 ERA.\n2022-present.\nBird returned to the Isotopes to begin the 2022 season. There, before he was called up he had a 2.77 ERA with 34 strikeouts in 26 innings over 22 games, and induced a 64.4% ground ball rate.\nOn June 11, 2022, the Rockies selected Bird's contract and promoted him to the major leagues. He made his MLB debut on June 16, throwing one scoreless inning in relief versus the Cleveland Guardians. On July 3, Bird earned his first career win after pitching a scoreless 8th inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks. With the Rockies in 2022, he was 2–4 with a 4.91 ERA in 47 innings over 38 games.\nBird was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque to begin the 2023 season. However, he was brought back up on Opening Day, and stayed up with the team. Bird maintained a spot on the Rockies roster for the entire 2023 season. He went 3-3 with a 4.33 ERA in 89.1 innings (his 84.1 relief innings tied him with the Detroit Tigers’ Tyler Holton for the most innings by any MLB reliever, and tied for the ninth-most by a Rockies reliever all-time) over 70 games (8th in the National League).\n His 89.1 innings overall were the fourth-most for a season in Rockies history among pitchers who had pitched in relief 95% of the time. Bird led the 2023 Colorado Rockies season in pitching appearances with 70, including 3 games started and 8 games finished. His 52.6% ground ball percentage was the highest on the Rockies pitching staff for any pitcher with more than 25 innings pitched. He finished the season with 77 strikeouts and 27 walks against 381 batters faced.\nPitching repertoire.\nBird is a ground ball pitcher with a low-slot, sidearm delivery. His sinker, which he throws 60% of the time, averages 95.3 mph, and has significant tailing action, inducing ground balls. He throws a low-90s cutter, and a breaking ball at 81-83 mph."

        "text": "The 1929–30 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 25th season of play for the program. The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nCornell began the season like it had many before; struggling to get usable ice during a warm winter. Sure enough, the ice wasn't good enough for the team's first scheduled game and the match with Union was postponed. The following week the team headed to Clinton to face Hamilton and, in a surprising result, routed the Continentals 6–0. It was the most goals Cornell had scored in a game in six years and gave hope for a program that was typically bereft of offensive firepower.\nMost of that hope evaporated during the next game when Clarkson throttled Cornell 0–8. The team was able to get several practices in afterwards, during the examination break, and the team returned much better prepared for their next opponent. Cornell made swift work of Colgate, again showing their scoring potential with a 7–1 victory. The game saw the debut of Shields I net for Cornell and coach Bawlf was hoping he had found a new star. Shields took a puck over his eye during practice and sported a sizable gash in the next game against St. Lawrence. Cornell lambasted the Saints, scoring seemingly at will against a team that had given them fits over the previous two years. The win ensured that Cornell would have at least a .500 record for the year and saw every reserve member see some playing time.\nThe team's next game came just three days later and the lack of rest didn't blunt the team's scoring. Cornell won its 4th game of the year with a 7–1 score, giving the Big Red their first winning season in eight years. The squad had another short break before heading down to New Jersey for their final game of the year. Despite all that they had accomplished, Princeton easily handled the Big Red, serving notice that Cornell still had a ways to go before they could compete with the college hockey elite.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

It was the 108th edition of the Rose Bowl Game, and was one of the 2021–22 bowl games concluding the 2021 FBS football season. Sponsored by Capital One Venture X, the game was officially known as the Rose Bowl Game presented by Capital One Venture X.\nThe game saw Ohio State overcoming a 14-point deficit over Utah late in the 2nd quarter to win 48-45, on a 19-yard field goal by Noah Ruggles.\nThe game was organized by the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association and was preceded by the Rose Parade in the morning. Actor LeVar Burton served as Grand Marshal of the Rose Parade. The theme was \"Dream. Believe. Achieve.\" The winner of the game was awarded with the Leishman Trophy.\nTeams.\nConsistent with conference tie-ins, the game was played between Big Ten Conference representative Ohio State and Pac-12 Conference champion Utah. The teams were officially welcomed to Southern California at Disneyland on December 27.\nThis marked the second meeting between the teams; they first met on September 27, 1986, at Ohio Stadium where Ohio State defeated Utah, 64–6.\nOhio State Buckeyes.\nThe Buckeyes, the co-champions of the Big Ten Conference East Division, made their 16th trip to Pasadena to compete in a Rose Bowl Game. Ohio State finished their regular season with an overall 10–2 record, 8–1 in Big Ten games. Their losses came to Oregon in the second week of the season, and to Michigan at the end of the season. The loss to Michigan dropped the Buckeyes out of a spot in the College Football Playoff. Ohio State defeated three ranked teams during the regular season: Penn State, Purdue, and Michigan State. Quarterback C.J. Stroud placed fourth in the annual Heisman Trophy race.\nUtah Utes.\nWinners of the Pac-12 championship, this was the first Rose Bowl Game for the Utes. Utah finished their regular season with a 9–3 overall record, 8–1 in Pac-12 play. Their losses came to BYU, San Diego State, and Oregon State. The Utes then faced Oregon in the Pac-12 Championship Game, a rematch between the teams. Utah had defeated Oregon on November 20 by a 38–7 score, and defeated them again for the Pac-12 title, 38–10. The Utes entered the Rose Bowl with an overall 10–3 record.\nGame highlights.\nThe game featured the biggest plays (i.e., plays over 30 yards) in a Rose Bowl. Wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba set school, all-Bowls, and FBS receiving records with 347 yards on 15 receptions (23.13 yards per catch average). Quarterback C.J. Stroud set a new school and Rose Bowl record with 573 passing yards (no sacks), and a Rose Bowl record six passing touchdowns. The Buckeyes' 683 total yards were a new school record as well as a record for the program in any bowl. Both teams scored 56 points combined by halftime, tying a Rose Bowl record.\nMarvin Harrison Jr. made his first collegiate career start, catching three touchdowns.\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was nationally telecasted by ESPN. Chris Fowler Handled Play-by-play duties while Kirk Herbstreit provided color analysis. Holly Rowe and Tiffany Blackmon served as sideline reporters. On National Radio Tom Hart called the game with Jordan Rodgers as his color analyst and Cole Cubelic as their sideline reporter for ESPN Radio. Locally, WBNS broadcast the game in Ohio with Paul Keels and Jim Lachey on the call. In Utah, KALL put on the broadcast, called by Bill Riley, Scott Mitchell, and Stevenson Sylvester. Internationally, the game was made available by ESPN Brasil, with Matheus Suman and Antony Curti on the call\nHall of Fame.\nThe Rose Bowl Hall of Fame induction ceremony was held on December 30, 2021, in front of the Rose Bowl stadium. The 2021 class consisted of Anthony Davis (USC), Jim Delany (Big Ten Conference), and Ron Simpkins (Michigan)."

        "text": "Allan Smith (10 January 1875 - 31 March 1926) was a Scotland international rugby union player A former headmaster at Loretto School in Musselburgh, which he attended as a pupil, his sermons to the pupils were published in a book in 1929.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nSmith went to Loretto School in Musselburgh between 1884 and 1894. He played many sports including rugby union.\nHe went to Trinity College in Oxford University. He graduated with second class honours.\nSmith played rugby union for Oxford University.\nProvincial career.\nHe was capped by Provinces District in 1894.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 11 times for the Scotland international side.\nHe captained the Scotland side on a world tour.\nTeaching career.\nAfter his rugby career finished, he became a house tutor at Borough Road Training College. He became an inspector of schools in Liverpool from 1903 to 1908.\nHis brother in law Rev. Adam Forman was a chaplain of Loretto School from 1907 to 1912; and Smith secured the headmaster post at his old school in 1908 - succeeding H. B. Tristam, who relinquished the role on health reasons. Smith remained in post until his death.\nAt the School, Smith was noted for his sermons to the pupils; and a book was published on them. The book was reviewed in \"The Scotsman\" newspaper of 9 May 1929:\nLoretto School Sermons. By Allan Ramsay Smith, late Headmaster of Loretto. 6s. net. London: Milford.\nIt is claimed for the public schools that they have: the greatest potentiality in the development of character and personality, that they have power to offer a very complete preparation for life. It is a consideration in which are manifest alike the nobility of tho teacher's calling, and its great responsibilities. The Loretto sermons of the late Mr Allan Ramsay Smith, who was headmaster from 1908 till 1926, show that for him, a scholar and sportsman, public school tradition was but a stage in a progress - to service in the larger life for the boy growing to manhood. This little volume has many passages which make the message clear. \"We must learn here to work hard; to confront sin with courage; to shield ourselves with faith in God's high purpose; to guard ourselves by being true to what we think . . . . Perhaps none of us will be great authors or great soldiers or great statesmen; we can all be great men.\" Thus concludes a 1908 address, in which courage (which every boy is quick to appreciate on cricket or football field) is shown as independent of the applause or ridicule it may bring. A kindred theme is expressed in a later discourse where that, admission of fears is shown to be a step towards their conquest: \"You cannot bo honest with yourselves without courage. If you would win knowledge you must admit your ignorance, you must face your mistakes.\" Mr Smith's style \"has charm and winning persuasiveness, and is often graced by the happy use of picturesque metaphor, as for example in an address on the theme, \"Traditions are not enough,\" where there occurs the illustration: — \"Often I have found a path across a moor which because many have trodden on it, has become wet and slippery; and the wise pedestrian , if he is sure of his direction, will go more safely if he walks a little way from it.\" The war - as might be expected when one recalls the school's fine record of service— gave Mr Smith many themes from which a high moral is drawn, and the titles, \"The Cloud of Witnesses\", \"Patriotism\", \"Liberty\" show how the terrible conflict could yield its peaceable fruit ; there is also a notable sermon on Matthew xxvi, 7, delivered on the completion of the war memorial in Loretto chapel. The discourses ware not written for publication, but it is certain that a wide usefulness opens for thorn in volume form; and thus, too, they will serve as a fragrant remembrancer to many Lorotto boys of the headmaster , whose \" Layman's Sermons \" were both inspiration and benediction to them in their school days.\nSmith was succeeded as headmaster by another Scotland international rugby union player James Greenlees.\nFamily.\nHis parents were James Smith (1841-1909) and Amy McLellan Oliphant (1852-1932). They had 5 sons, including Allan; and 2 daughters.\nHe married Violet Russell (1874-1931) in 1902 in Hampshire, England. They had a son and a daughter.\nDeath.\nHe died at Catherine Lodge, Inveresk; noted as after a short illness.\nHis estate on death was valued at £63,524. He left £100 to each servant that was in his employment for ten years and \"failing issue who shall attain an interest\", left the ultimate residue of his property to Loretto School.\nA memorial of a clock and tablet was first erected to Smith at the school.\nLoretto School later erected another memorial to him and his brother in law Charles Russell. The \"Musselburgh News\" of 9 March 1928:\nA new memorial has been erected by Loretto School in memory of the late headmaster, Mr Allan Ramsay Smith. B.A. (Oxon.). It takes the form of a two leaf door of oak, installed at the west end of the school chapel, and is very much in keeping with this old and picturesque edifice. Two inscribed panels are displayed on the inside of the memorial. They read \"To the glory of God and in memory of Allan Ramsay Smith, headmaster here 1908 till his death in the service of the school, March 1926\" — \"and of his friend and brother Charles Russell, O.L., Indian Education Service, captain. 3rd Gurkha Rifles, who fell in action within sight of Jerusalem. November 1917.\" Captain Russell, who was a son of Lady Russell, was the brother-in-law of Mr Smith. The outside of the door is a mass of beautiful carvings, thistles, roses, lilies. etc. all being portrayed. An exquisitely carved atone tablet placed on the dovecots in the orchard was the first memorial to the late school headmaster."
