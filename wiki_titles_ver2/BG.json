        "title": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club",
        "text": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club is a golf course in the United Kingdom in North West England, located in Southport, Merseyside. It is one of the clubs in the rotation for both the Open Championship and Women's British Open and has hosted the Open Championship ten times from 1954 through 2017. Winners of the Open at the course include Pádraig Harrington, Mark O'Meara, Ian Baker-Finch, Tom Watson, Johnny Miller, Lee Trevino, Arnold Palmer, Peter Thomson (twice) and Jordan Spieth. The course is scheduled to hold Open Championship again in 2026.\nRoyal Birkdale hosted the women's tournament for a sixth time in 2014, and was the site of the Senior Open Championship in 2013. It has also hosted the Ryder Cup (1965, 1969), the Walker Cup (1951), and the Curtis Cup (1948). Other courses in the Open rota near Liverpool are Royal Liverpool Golf Club (Hoylake) and Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club.\nOn 22 July 2017, in the third round of the 2017 Open Championship, Branden Grace became the first man in major championship history to record a score of 62 in a single round.\nHistory.\nFounded as Birkdale Golf Club in 1889, the club was awarded \"Royal\" status in 1951. Birkdale Golf Club moved to a new site in Birkdale Hills in 1894, and built a new distinctive art deco clubhouse in 1935. In early 1939, Birkdale was nominated as the venue for the 1940 Open Championship but the Second World War started in September 1939 and the Championship was cancelled.\nIn 1946, the club finally hosted its first big championship in the Amateur Championship, won by Irishman Jimmy Bruen. During the immediate postwar era, the club also hosted the 1948 Curtis Cup and the 1951 Walker Cup, both won by the United States. With these successful stagings of important events, Royal Birkdale was felt to be ready for its first Open Championship in 1954 and has continued on the Open rota ever since.\nThree generations of the Hawtree family of golf course architects have worked on the course. Frederick G. Hawtree and champion golfer J.H. Taylor are the two people most responsible for the current routing, following the valleys between the very large dunes which dominate the property. The arrangement makes for excellent spectator conditions during major events. Frederick W. Hawtree, the son of Frederick G, performed some modifications in the 1960s and in 1993 Martin Hawtree, son of Frederick W., improved and modernised the layout further, with all 18 of the club's greens being completely rebuilt, to improve turf and drainage following the 1991 Open Championship. Only relatively minor tweaking, such as the addition of a few new bunkers and back tees, has been deemed necessary in advance of the last two Open Championships. The course was ranked as the 18th best in the world outside the United States, in the 2007 rankings by \"Golf Digest\" magazine.\nDuring the 1960s, the club hosted the Ryder Cup twice, in 1965 and in 1969. The United States won in 1965 by the score of 19½–12½, but in 1969 the competition ended in a 16–16 tie when Jack Nicklaus generously conceded a short putt to Tony Jacklin to halve their match, which later became known as \"The Concession.\" As defending champions in a tie, the U.S. retained the trophy; they kept it for another sixteen years, until 1985.\nIn 2013, the club hosted the Senior Open Championship.\nOpen Championship.\nThe Open Championship was first held at Royal Birkdale in 1954 and has hosted ten times. \nThe Open began paying in U.S. dollars in 2017, subsequent figures in pounds are rounded estimates.\nWomen’s British Open.\nWinners of the Women's British Open at Royal Birkdale.

        "title": "Turnberry (golf course)",
        "text": "Trump Turnberry is a golf resort on the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire, southwest Scotland. It comprises three links golf courses, a golf academy, a five-star James Miller-designed hotel from 1906, along with lodge and cottage accommodations.\nTurnberry was a popular golf course and resort from its inception, made accessible because of the Maidens and Dunure Light Railway. It closed in both World Wars for military use, and there was concern it would not open following World War II, but it was redesigned by Mackenzie Ross and re-opened in 1951. The course was the scene of the 1977 Open Championship, where Tom Watson scored a close victory over Jack Nicklaus. The property has been owned by the Trump Organization since 2014, who now brand the course Trump Turnberry.\nLocation.\nThe resort is south of Glasgow, on the A719 just north of the A77, a major road from Glasgow to Stranraer via Ayr. It is sited on headland along the Firth of Clyde, overlooking the Isle of Arran and Ailsa Craig.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea of the course came from Archibald Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa after the announcement of the Maidens and Dunure Light Railway in 1899. The line would follow the Ayrshire coastline from Ayr to Girvan. The Marquess owned of land at Turnberry Green, south of Maidens, which was infertile and unsuitable for agriculture, and therefore an ideal golf course location. He realised the new railway would provide easy access for people wanting to visit a quality course. Following the construction of the line, he asked 1883 Open Championship winner Willie Fernie to design a suitable course. Fernie designed an initial round of 13 holes in 1901, with a second-round following later.\nThe hotel was designed by station architect James Miller, whose other work included and railway stations. It was built adjacent to the railway, and opened concurrently with the station on 17 May 1906. The course was intended to attract visitors from across Britain, and was advertised heavily in the national press.\nThe property was used as an airbase in World War I, and a landing strip built for this purpose still exists, now disused. The Royal Flying Corps trained pilots in the arts of aerial gunnery and combat, and the Turnberry Hotel was used as a hospital for the wounded. After the war, courses 1 and 2 were rebuilt and renamed \"Ailsa\" and \"Arran\". A memorial to honour lost airmen was erected on the hill overlooking the ninth hole of Ailsa, which is still standing.\nThe cycle was repeated for World War II. The hotel was commissioned as a hospital, and the golf courses were seconded for air training for the Royal Air Force (RAF); it is thought that as many as 200 died at the base.\nThe hotel and golf course was served by its own dedicated railway station. Turnberry railway station opened in 1906 and operated until 1942, when the Maidens and Dunure Light Railway line was partially closed.\nFollowing the war, the course was in need of refurbishment and the hotel was in a dilapidated state. Frank Hole, chairman of British Transport Hotels, convinced the Government that golf courses should be rebuilt and restored. The architect Mackenzie Ross rebuilt the course, removing the wartime runways and covering the land with sand and topsoil. Ross is credited with restoring the courses to their high quality, and the Ailsa course was re-opened in 1951, a seaside links with views of Ailsa Craig and the Isle of Arran.\nStarwood acquired the hotel in 1997, and until 2008, was operated under the Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts brand. In 2008, Leisurecorp, Dubai World's sport and leisure subsidiary purchased the resort, with Starwood continuing to manage operations under The Luxury Collection brand.\nTrump ownership.\nDonald Trump purchased the hotel and golf courses from Leisurecorp in 2014 for $60 million, and the resort was renamed Trump Turnberry. Trump resigned his directorship of the companies which own Trump Turnberry in 2017, just before he was inaugurated as President of the United States, and passed control to his sons Donald Jr and Eric. The Trump Organization claims to have spent about $200 million on renovating the course; $18 million were accounted for in 2016. Donald Trump remains the owner of Golf Recreation Scotland, which in turn owns SLC Turnberry.\nFinancing for Trump's golf courses came under scrutiny in the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Glenn Simpson testified before Congress that \"enormous amounts of capital [was] flowing into these projects from unknown sources and – or at least on paper it says it’s from the Trump Organisation, but it’s hundreds of millions of dollars. And these golf courses are just, you know, they’re sinks. They don’t actually make any money.\"\nIn September 2019, it was reported that the House Oversight and Reform Committee of the United States Congress was investigating increased military expenditure at Glasgow Prestwick Airport that might constitute a conflict of interest in regards to the Trump Turnberry golf course. It was reported in September 2019 that the Pentagon had spent nearly $200,000 at Turnberry since Trump took office, although stays by Air Force crews remained consistent compared to previous years with only 6% staying at Turnberry from 2015-2019. A report released by Air Mobility Command in response to the investigation found no wrongdoing by its aircrews in acquiring accommodation around the Prestwick Airport.\nAfter the 2021 United States Capitol attack, the organizer of the championship, The R&amp;A, announced that The Open would not be held again at Turnberry as long as its links to the Trump Organization remain.\nIn February 2023, the company managing the golf course, SLC Turnberry Ltd., reported pre-tax losses of 3.7 million pounds ($4.57 million) in 2021.\nCourses.\nThe Ailsa Course, redesigned by Mackenzie Ross between 1949 and 1951, and again by Martin Ebert between 2015 and 2016, has staged The Open Championship on four occasions (1977, 1986, 1994, and 2009). It has also hosted many other important golf tournaments, including the Women's British Open in 2002, the Walker Cup in 1963, the Amateur Championship in 1961, 1983, 1996, and 2008, and the Senior Open Championship on seven occasions, 1987–90, 2003, 2006, and 2012. The Ailsa Course is featured in the 2004 golf video game Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005.\nThe other two courses at Turnberry are the King Robert the Bruce course and the nine-hole Arran course. The Kintyre Course, opened in 2001 and existed at the resort until it was replaced by the King Robert the Bruce course in 2017. The Kintyre Course was designed by Donald Steel and built on the foundations of the old Arran layout, which had been rebuilt along with the Ailsa Course following World War II. During the war, the resort was used as a hospital and the courses were flattened and paved for use as a major RAF airfield. The new Arran Course opened in 2002.\nOther golf facilities at the resort include the Colin Montgomerie Links Golf Academy and a pitch and putt course.\nIn 2003, the 18th hole on the Ailsa Course, \"Ailsa Hame\", was renamed \"Duel in the Sun\" as homage to the battle between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus in 1977; this is also the name of a sports bar at the resort. In 2009, Watson, 59, held a one-shot lead when he bogeyed this hole in the final round, eventually losing the Open Championship in a playoff.\nAilsa Course scorecard.\nThe official names are:\nThe Open Championship.\nAt its first Open Championship in 1977, the course was the scene of the famous \"Duel in the Sun\", when Tom Watson claimed a classic victory, one stroke ahead of Jack Nicklaus.\nThe two were paired during the final two rounds and finished well ahead of the rest of the field. They posted identical scores for the first three rounds, and were tied through the 16th hole of the final round. Nicklaus missed a short birdie putt on the par-5 17th hole to tie Watson, who had reached in two and birdied. On the par-4 18th hole, Nicklaus recovered from the rough and sank a lengthy birdie putt, which forced Watson to sink his short birdie putt to win, which he did. It was the second of Watson's five Open titles; down two strokes on the 13th tee, he bested Nicklaus by three shots over the final six holes.\nNine years later in 1986, Greg Norman claimed the first of his two Opens (his only major titles), winning by five strokes. Nick Price won his second major (and only Open) in 1994, a single stroke ahead of runner-up Jesper Parnevik.\nAfter a fifteen-year absence, the Ailsa Course hosted the Open in 2009, where 59-year-old Watson nearly won his sixth Open Championship. Up by a stroke at the 72nd hole, his approach shot took an unfortunate bounce on the front of the green, then ran off the back and led to a bogey. Watson then lost a four-hole playoff with Stewart Cink by six strokes; Cink birdied the 72nd hole and then posted two pars and two birdies in the playoff to win his only major title.\nIn 2015, the governing body for Golf, The R&amp;A, announced that the 2020 Open Championship would not be played at Turnberry, even though it had previously been considered likely to host the tournament. The R&amp;A were unimpressed with several remarks by Donald Trump; one member said he would like Turnberry to host the Open again, but \"not Trump Turnberry\". In February 2018 the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Robert Wood \"Woody\" Johnson IV, told colleagues that he had been instructed by then-President Trump to seek British government help in securing the British Open for Turnberry. Although advised not to do so by his deputy, Lewis Lukens, he reportedly did suggest to David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, that the Open be moved to Turnberry. However, a later British government statement said that Johnson \"made no request of Mr. Mundell regarding the British Open or any other sporting event.\"\nFollowing the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, the R&amp;A announced that it had no plans to stage any of its competitions at Turnberry and would not do so \"until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself\".\nThe Open Championship winners at Turnberry, all played on the par-70 Ailsa Course:\nThe Senior Open Championship.\nWinners of The Senior Open Championship at Turnberry.\nWomen's British Open.\nWinner of the Women's British Open at Turnberry.\nThe Ailsa Course was played as a par-72 at in 2002; and played marginally longer at in 2015.\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"

        "title": "Golf Channel",
        "text": "Golf Channel (also verbally referred to as simply \"Golf\" or \"NBC Golf\") is an American sports television network owned by the NBC Sports Group division of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. Founded in Birmingham, Alabama, it is currently based out of NBC Sports' headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe channel focuses on coverage of the sport of golf, including live coverage of tournaments, as well as factual and instructional programming. It is the cable television rightsholder of the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour, and PGA European Tour, and also holds rights to selected USGA tournaments and the NCAA Division I golf championships. Since 2016, it has also participated in NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics, focusing on its golf competitions.\nVia the Golf Channel unit, Comcast also owns other golf-related businesses, including the course reservation service GolfNow, online golf instruction provider Revolution Golf, and the World Long Drive Championship. Some of these associated properties operate from the network's former home of Orlando, Florida.\n, Golf Channel was available to approximately 70.3 million pay television households (76.2% of households with cable) in the United States. , the channel was available in 61.0 million homes.\nHistory.\nThe idea of a 24-hour golf network came from media entrepreneur Joseph E. Gibbs of Birmingham, Alabama, who first thought of such a concept in 1991. Gibbs felt there was enough interest in golf among the public to support such a network, and commissioned a Gallup Poll to see if his instincts were correct. With the support of the polling behind him, Gibbs and legendary golfer Arnold Palmer then secured $80 million in financing from several cable television providers (including Adelphia Communications Corporation, Cablevision Industries, Comcast, Continental Cablevision, Newhouse, and the Times Mirror Company) to launch the network, which was among the first subscription networks developed to cover one singular sport.\nAnnounced in February 1993, the launch date was targeted for May 1994; and it was launched on January 17, 1995, as The Golf Channel with a ceremonial flip of the switch by co-founder Arnold Palmer. The first live tournament the channel televised was the Dubai Desert Classic, held January 19–22. Originally a premium channel with limited subscribers, it retooled in September 1995 to be part of basic-tier pay TV to reach more viewers, and ratings rapidly increased. In 1996, Fox Cable Networks acquired a minority stake in the channel for $50 million.\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Golf Channel held part of the PGA Tour's cable rights for early-round coverage. To boost their availability, Golf Channel reached an agreement with Fox Sports Networks (FSN) to air simulcasts of the coverage. In 2002, Golf Channel lost its rights to the main PGA Tour, but gained rights to the developmental Buy.com Tour.\nAcquisition by Comcast.\nIn 2001, Fox sold its 30.9% stake in Golf Channel, as well as its stake in Outdoor Life Network, to minority owner Comcast as part of a larger transaction by Fox to acquire Comcast's stake in Speedvision. In December 2003, Comcast acquired the remaining 8.6% stake of Golf Channel it did not already own from the Tribune Company, giving it full ownership.\nIn January 2007, Golf Channel became the exclusive cable broadcaster of the PGA Tour as part of a new 15-year contract, replacing ESPN and USA Network. The contract included early-round coverage of all official money events, and 13 events per-season carried exclusively by the network. By then, Golf Channel had carriage in 75 million homes. It also simplified its branding, dropping the article \"The\" from its on-air name.\nConcurrently, Comcast also launched Versus/Golf HD, a 1080i high definition channel featuring programming from Golf Channel and sister network Versus. Golf Channel programming was broadcast during the daytime hours, and Versus programming was broadcast during the evening and primetime hours. This arrangement ended in December 2008, when both networks launched their own 24-hour high-definition simulcasts.\nIn March 2008, Comcast acquired the online golf reservation platform GolfNow. It was re-located to Golf Channel's headquarters in Orlando.\nMerger with NBC Sports.\nIn January 2011, Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake in NBC Universal from General Electric. As a result of the re-alignment of Comcast's existing properties into NBC Universal, Golf Channel and sister sports network Versus were subsumed by a restructured NBC Sports division. On-air synergies between NBC's existing production unit began to take effect in February 2011 at the WGC Match Play Championship, when NBC's golf telecasts took on the Golf Channel branding as \"Golf Channel on NBC\", in a similar manner to ESPN's co-branding of sports output on ABC. NBC Sports personalities could now appear on Golf Channel, and former NBC Sports senior vice president Mike McCarley took over as the network's new head. The network also adopted an amended logo featuring the NBC peacock.\nIn December 2013, Golf Channel unveiled a new logo, implemented in May 2014 to coincide with the 2014 Players Championship. The new logo replaces the \"swinging G\" emblem that had been used since the network's launch with a wordmark alongside the NBC peacock. The new logo was meant to provide a unified brand across Golf Channel's associated properties and services. That month, it also partnered with Sirius XM PGA Tour Radio to feature audio simulcasts of its studio programming.\nIn 2014, Golf Channel acquired rights to the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championship. In 2015, it also began to broadcast the NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championships. In 2017, Golf Channel extended its rights to the tournaments through 2029.\nOn June 8, 2015, it was announced that NBC Sports had acquired rights to The Open Championship beginning in 2017 under a 12-year deal; after former broadcaster ESPN opted out of the final year of rights, NBC began coverage in 2016 instead. Early round coverage is aired by Golf Channel, which marked the first time ever that Golf Channel had ever broadcast one of the four Men's major golf championships. On May 3, 2016, NBC announced that Golf Channel would air the bulk of the men's and women's golf tournaments for the 2016 Summer Olympics, covering up to 300 hours of the tourney, with 130 of those hours live.\nIn 2016, Golf Channel acquired the World Long Drivers Association, organizer of the World Long Drive Championships; coverage of its events were subsequently added to the network. In 2017, Golf Channel acquired Revolution Golf, an online provider of golf instructional materials.\nJanuary 14, 2018, broadcast technicians represented by IATSE went on strike affecting tournament coverage for the Sony Open in Honolulu, Hawaii, Web.com from the Bamahas and Diamond Resorts Invitational in Orlando. Ten days later the striking workers returned to work after a new contract was ratified on January 24, 2018. \nIn February 2019, Golf Channel announced a new subscription service known as GolfPass. The service will feature a variety of content, including a streaming library of archive content, instructional content, as well as special offers (such as credit for free round of golf per-year, and a premium tier offering additional discounts). Rory McIlroy will also be involved in the service, hosting new instructional content for GolfPass, as well as an autobiographical web series.\nIn February 2020, it was reported that Golf Channel would consolidate its television operations with the remainder of NBC Sports at its facilities in Stamford, Connecticut, in a move expected to occur over the next 12 to 18 months. The GolfNow and GolfPass services will continue to primarily operate from Orlando. With the move to Stamford, Golf Channel also ended its long-time morning show \"Morning Drive\", replacing it with the new midday show \"Golf Today\" from Stamford beginning January 4, 2021.\nIn 2021, amid the renewal of NBC Sports' rights to the circuit, and the upcoming shutdown of long-time sister network NBCSN (the former Versus), NBCUniversal began to put a greater emphasis on Golf Channel's rights to the PGA Tour. That November, it was announced that early-round coverage of the Open Championship, U.S. Open (which moved to Golf Channel after NBC re-acquired the rights to USGA tournaments in 2020), and their women's counterparts, would move to USA Network in 2022. At the 2022 Players Championship, Golf Channel adopted a special logo used on-air during PGA Tour telecasts and studio programming, which is co-branded with elements of the PGA Tour logo.\nProgramming.\nEvent coverage.\nGolf Channel is the pay television rightsholder of the PGA Tour, broadcasting live coverage of early rounds, and early window coverage of weekend rounds prior to network television coverage. Some events (particularly, late-season events such as the former Fall Series, and additional events) are broadcast in their entirety by the network. Golf Channel airs primetime encores of each round during PGA Tour events, including network television broadcasts from NBC or CBS where applicable. Golf Channel also broadcasts coverage of PGA Tour Champions and Korn Ferry Tour events. Outside of events organized by the PGA Tour, Golf Channel also carries coverage of the European Tour, LPGA Tour, and Asian Tour.\nGolf Channel was the cable broadcaster of two of the men's majors, including the U.S. Open and other USGA championships (since June 2020) and the Open Championship (since 2016, including their women's and senior men's events). In November 2021, it was announced that early round coverage of the U.S. Open, the Open Championship, the U.S. Women's Open, and the Women's British Open, would move to USA Network beginning in 2022.\nSince 2016, it participates in NBCUniversal's coverage of the Summer Olympics by covering its golf competitions.

        "text": "Henry Franklin House (February 18, 1930 – March 13, 2005), nicknamed \"Pig\", was a catcher in Major League Baseball who played with the Detroit Tigers (1950–51, 1954–57, 1961), Kansas City Athletics (1958–59) and Cincinnati Reds (1960). He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\nIn a 10-season career, House posted a .248 batting average with 47 home runs and 235 RBI in 653 games. As a catcher, in 580 games he compiled a .988 fielding percentage with 2934 putouts, 258 assists, and 34 errors in 2934 total chances.\nA native of Bessemer, Alabama, House signed out of Hueytown High School with the Tigers in 1948 for one of the biggest bonuses of the time – $75,000 and two automobiles, according to news reports. House made his debut in 1950 at 20 years of age. He earned his nickname as a baby, when his family used to say he was \"big as a house\" and he twisted \"big\" into \"pig\". As a player, he stood tall and weighed . His mother-in-law said the nickname came about when he came in very dirty from playing outside and his mother told him \"you're dirty as a little pig, Frank.\"\nHouse was known as a solid defensive catcher with a fast release and a strong arm. He also called a good game and was great at blocking the plate. His most productive season came in 1955 when he hit .259 with 15 home runs and 53 RBI in 102 games. On April 21, 1958, House scored two runs as a pinch-hitter in an eight-run eighth inning, in a 9-4 Athletics victory over the Cleveland Indians. House's feat was only the sixth such occurrence in major league history.\nHouse later served in the Alabama Legislature, where he was instrumental in the creation of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1967. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1975 and was honored in 2004 when the Hall instituted the \"Frank \"Pig\" House Award\" to recognize contributors to state sports. A municipal golf course in his home town of Bessemer, Alabama, bears his name. He was a multi-star athlete at Hueytown High School when he signed his pro contract.\nHouse died in Birmingham, Alabama, at age 75. His interment was in Bessemer's Cedar Hill Cemetery."

        "text": "Tom Brennan (born May 2, 1949) is a radio and television sportscaster and former men's basketball head coach at the University of Vermont from 1986 to 2005.\nCoaching career.\nRaised in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, Brennan graduated as the all-time leading scorer at Phillipsburg Catholic High School. Brennan graduated from the University of Georgia in 1971, where, as a senior, he received the men's basketball team leadership award.\nHe began his coaching after graduating in the fall of 1971 as a graduate assistant at Georgia under Ken Rosemond. Sandwiched around a year as head basketball and baseball coach at Division III Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey, Brennan was an assistant under college basketball coaches Rollie Massimino at Villanova, Bill Raftery at Seton Hall and Bruce Parkhill at William &amp; Mary. In 1982, he was named head coach at Yale where he crafted a four-year record of 46–58, including back-to-back seasons of 14–12 and 13–13. At Yale, he coached players such as Earl \"Butch\" Graves and NBA veteran Chris Dudley.\nIn 19 years at Vermont, Brennan led the Catamounts to four 20+ win seasons, three America East championships and UVM's first three NCAA Tournament appearances, including the school's first NCAA Tournament win over Big East champion Syracuse in 2005. Brennan is one of two coaches in America East history to lead his team to three consecutive conference titles.\nBrennan's last four Vermont teams brought unprecedented positive national publicity to the men's basketball program and to the school. During his last season, Vermont became the first and only America East team to sell out every one of its home games at Patrick Gymnasium. During the second half of the 2004–05 season the Catamounts were the subject of five parts of ESPN's critically acclaimed nationally televised series, 'The Season.' UVM's upset also was nominated for an ESPY award in 2005.\nStandouts that Brennan coached at Vermont include Eddie Benton, the 1996 winner of the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award given to the nation's top senior less than 6-feet tall, Matt Johnson, Kevin Roberson, Trevor Gaines, T.J. Sorrentine and Taylor Coppenrath, a finalist in 2005 for both the John Wooden and James Naismith National Player of the Year Awards, the first and only America East player to be on a final ballot for National Player of the Year.\nBroadcast career.\nDuring his coaching career, Brennan co-hosted a morning radio show in Burlington, Vermont called \"Corm and the Coach,\" with radio personality Steve Cormier, which began on WIZN-FM 106.7 FM in 1992. In 1998, the pair moved to WCVP-FM 101.3 and WCVR-FM 102.1 until July 2008, when Brennan decided to retire from his position as morning radio personality. In November 2009, Brennan and Cormier teamed up again to bring \"Corm and the Coach\" briefly back on the air on 107.1 WNMR before moving to television on WCAXtra TV and on the internet on NSN.net until 2011. Brennan delivers \"Saturday Night Live\"-style sports reports and his thoughts on basketball, politics, entertainment, local news and psychology. The Coach's repertoire also included live, pre-dawn wake-up calls to his players and coaching colleagues. In the 2003 and 2004 off-seasons, he also was a co-host on several ESPN national radio shows.\nAfter his retirement from coaching in 2005, Brennan joined ESPN working as a college basketball studio analyst as well as doing color commentary across the ESPN family of networks. He worked at ESPN until 2009. In December 2010, Brennan joined Sirius XM Radio as a co-host of College Basketball Today that airs during the college hoops season. Brennan also does radio commentary for college basketball on Westwood One, now known as Dial Global Sports, as well as television work for NBC Sports Network, appearing as a college basketball analyst on NBC SportsTalk.\nFamily.\nBrennan and his wife, Lynn reside on Lake Champlain in Colchester, Vermont.

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club",
        "text": "Somerset County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Somerset. Founded in 1875, Somerset was initially regarded as a minor county until official first-class status was acquired in 1895. Somerset has competed in the County Championship since 1891 and has subsequently played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. The club's limited overs team was formerly named the Somerset Sabres, but is now known only as Somerset.\nSomerset's early history is complicated by arguments about its status. It is generally regarded as a minor county from its foundation in 1875 until 1890, apart from the 1882 to 1885 seasons when it is considered by substantial sources to have been an \"unofficial\" first-class team, holding important match status. There are, however, two matches involving W. G. Grace in 1879 and 1881 which are considered first-class by some authorities. In 1891, Somerset joined the County Championship, which had just become an officially recognised competition, and has important match status from 1891 to 1894. The county is classified as an \"official\" first-class team from 1895 by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the County Championship clubs; classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963; and classified as a senior Twenty20 team since 2003.\nSomerset have never won the County Championship, their highest finish being second, which they achieved in 2001, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2018 and 2019. The club won their first silverware in the late 1970s, winning both the Gillette Cup and John Player League in 1979. In the years since, Somerset have experienced some success in one-day cricket, winning the Gillette Cup on two further occasions, the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup twice and the John Player League once more. The team has reached the final of the Twenty20 cup competition on six occasions, winning it in 2005 and 2023. They won the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup, their first since emerging victorious in the 2001 edition.\nThe club has its headquarters at the County Ground, Taunton, where in the present-day almost all of its games are played. Since 2005, Somerset also play at Taunton Vale against MCC Universities teams (including first-class matches in 2012 and 2015); Taunton Vale is also the regular home venue for the Second XI team. The club have played at a number of other grounds in their past, with a significant number of matches at Clarence Park (until 1996), Weston-super-Mare and the Recreation Ground, Bath (until 2011).\nHistory.\nEarliest cricket in Somerset.\nIn the seventeenth century, the related sport of \"Stow-Ball\", or \"Stob-Ball\" was being played in north Somerset, as in neighbouring Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, as well as parts of Dorset. This sport most likely used either the base of a tree or its remaining stump as its wicket, as both 'stow' and 'stob' are dialect words for 'stump'. However, 'stow' could also refer to a frame used to support crawling tunnels in mines such as those lead mines in north Somerset, providing another possibility for the wicket. The ball was made of a leather case, stuffed with boiled quills, and was four inches in diameter, roughly the same size as a modern softball, while the bats, known as 'staves' were shaped similarly to a field hockey stick and typically made of withy or willow.\nThe earliest confirmed reference to cricket in Somerset is a match on 13 July 1751 that was played in memory of the late Frederick, Prince of Wales who was a noted patron of the sport. The first officially organised club to be recognised in Somerset was Lansdown Cricket Club, formed in 1825, although a Bath cricket club seems to have preceded it with a similar collection of enthusiasts from around 1817–1824. With a limited number of other organised clubs to play, fixtures were few and far apart in the founding years, with matches being played against Clifton, Sidmouth and Teignmouth. Lansdown placed Somerset in the cricketing world, and played a number of matches against 'England XI' in various forms.\nIn 1865, the first attempt at a county side was made with the formation of \"Yeovil and County Cricket Club\". They performed poorly in their opening matches against local club sides, and on one occasion, even lost three players to their opposition the day before the match was scheduled to begin. In spite of these problems, they did play a 'county' fixture, against the \"Gentlemen of Devon\"; the match was abandoned due to rain. The first recorded occasion of a \"Gentlemen of Somerset\" side playing comes five years previously however, when a Somerset side travelled down to Culm Vale to take on the \"Gentlemen of Devon\", this match also resulting in a draw.\nOrigin of club.\nThe formation of Somerset County Cricket Club was decided in 1875 after the playing of one such match between the \"Gentlemen of Somerset\" and the \"Gentlemen of Devon\" at Sidmouth in Devon. Having played a two-day match, which the Somerset team won by eight wickets, the Gentlemen of Somerset and their friends held a meeting and resolved the Somerset should have its own county cricket club. Somerset is the only one of the present first-class counties in English cricket whose county cricket club was founded outside the boundaries of the traditional county. After their resolution, the gentlemen continued playing games under the name \"Gentlemen of Somerset\", but their fixtures became more regular; rather than occasional games against the \"Gentlemen of Devon\", they played host to teams from Dorset and Devon in 1876, and in 1877 visited Dorset, Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Wiltshire in addition to their trip to Devon.\nThe following 1878 season, two matches were played by a \"Somerset\" team; a two-day match against Hertfordshire played at St Albans finished in a draw, while Worcestershire were beaten by an innings and 47 runs later in the month at Bath. In 1879, Somerset played nine matches, albeit one of them against a Wells team. During these early seasons, Somerset were never far from insolvency. An initial letter sent out after the formation of the club had only managed to raise £70 17s, while gate receipts in the first season raised the club £1 15s 8d. Despite this, fixtures continued to be arranged, and the amateurs kept on playing; bringing their own kit and paying for their own tickets for travel to away matches.\nThere are alternative versions of when Somerset's first first-class match took place, and matches in 1879 and 1881 are central to the statistics of W. G. Grace – see the article on Variations in first-class cricket statistics. If those games are discounted, then Somerset CCC played its initial first-class match against Lancashire CCC at Old Trafford on 8, 9 and 10 June 1882 and joined the (then unofficial) County Championship. This first-class status lasted for only four seasons: after the 1885 season, Somerset failed to arrange sufficient fixtures with the other first-class teams to be accorded first-class status.\nIn 1890, following a successful recruitment policy at universities by the club's first full-time secretary, Henry Murray-Anderdon, Somerset played 13 games, including 2 against Middlesex, winning 12 of them and tying the other against Middlesex, furthering their ambition to be a first-class county.\nAt the third annual meeting of The County Cricket Council on 9 December 1889 the counties decided to create a sub-committee to consider whether an official classification of the counties should exist and how counties might rise from one class to another. Somerset was one of the 6 counties represented on the committee. The committee met on 11 August 1890 and proposed three classes of counties. The existing 8 first-class counties would remain with Somerset one of 8 second-class counties proposed. A system of promotion and relegation was suggested. These proposals was debated at the fourth annual meeting of The County Cricket Council on 8 December 1890. They were not well received. Eventually a vote was taken on whether The County Cricket Council itself should be suspended sine die. The motion was passed on the casting vote of the Chairman and The County Cricket Council effectively ceased to exist. \"This utterly unexpected result fairly took those present by surprise, and they dispersed hurriedly – a most undignified ending to what we are compelled to describe as a most unbusinesslike meeting.\" Mr. H.T. Hewett and Mr. T. Spencer were present for Somerset. On the following day, 9 December 1890, the county secretaries met to decide the fixtures for 1891, which they did on the usual basis of arranging \"home and home\" matches against whichever counties they wished. \"The most noticeable feature ... is the encouragement given to Somersetshire by the chief county clubs. Middlesex played the western shire last summer, but Kent, Surrey, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire and Lancashire will next summer test the merits of the eleven, which showed such good all round cricket, under Mr. H.T. Hewett's command, last year.\" By arranging these 12 matches against first-class counties Somerset became a de facto first-class county without any proposal or vote to that effect. Hewett, Spencer and Mr. W.N. Roe were present for Somerset.\nPre-First World War.\nIn Somerset's second season, 1892, they finished third, but it was to be 66 years before they finished as high again. Until the Great Depression, the team regularly comprised a number of more or less talented amateurs and just a handful of professionals. They enjoyed over many decades a reputation for cheerful inconsistency, highlighted by three wins over an all-conquering Yorkshire side in 1901 and 1902, when they did not lose to any other county.\nFamous names from the pre-First World War period included the England players Sammy Woods, Lionel Palairet and Len Braund; the fast bowler Tom Richardson also played for the county once after his retirement from Surrey. In 1908, Woods persuaded the England rugby union international John Daniell to become captain with the team struggling financially, and Daniell stayed, mostly playing as captain and often acting as secretary too, for almost 20 years. However, in the immediate period before World War I, with the loss of the key amateurs who promoted the club to first-class status and financial difficulties forcing the club to dis-engage most of its few professionals, Somerset finished last four times in six years and lost fifteen and drew three of eighteen games in 1910.\nBetween the wars.\nIn the first season of the County Championship after the First World War, 1919, Somerset finished fifth in the table, the highest since 1892. But that was the highest position in the inter-war years, and mostly the side finished at or below halfway down the table, though there were no more bottom places in this period.\nThe team continued to be a mix of a few highly talented amateurs and a few good professionals, with the side often made up with amateur players who appeared in only a few games. Among the amateurs, the west Somerset farmer Jack White, who succeeded Daniell as captain in 1927, played for England as a left-arm orthodox spinning all-rounder and also captained the Test side in Australia in 1928–29. The briefest Test match career of them all was \"enjoyed\" by another amateur, Jack MacBryan, whose only game for England was the rain-ruined match against the South Africans in 1924, in which he neither batted nor bowled. Of the professionals, fleeting international careers were enjoyed by the hard-hitting batsman Harold Gimblett, whose entry into first-class cricket was the stuff of legends, and by Arthur Wellard, fast bowler and a mighty smiter of sixes.\nPost-Second World War.\nIn postwar cricket, the happy-go-lucky Somerset attitude was no longer sustainable, and the side finished bottom of the Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952. With the strong possibility of going out of business, drastic change was inevitable. Somerset recruited heavily from other countries, taking Colin McCool and Bill Alley from Australia, and from other counties. In 1958, under the captaincy of the first professional cricketer to captain the team, Maurice Tremlett, the side again finished third, and this was repeated in 1963 and 1966 under different captains, Harold Stephenson and Colin Atkinson, who later became headmaster at Millfield School.\nThere was a further dip in fortunes towards the end of the 1960s, but, though County Championship success continued to elude the county, Somerset finally found in the 1970s the makings of a successful one-day team under the combative, inspirational captaincy of Yorkshireman Brian Close. A trio of world class players, Viv Richards, Joel 'Big Bird' Garner and the England all-rounder Ian Botham made the team for the first time in its long history a formidable trophy winning proposition.\nThe real success came after Close had retired. Under the captaincy of left-handed opener Brian Rose, Somerset won their first ever silverware by taking the Gillette Cup and the Sunday League in 1979. In the same 1979 season, Somerset's newfound ruthless streak provoked controversy in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup limited-overs competition when Rose declared the Somerset innings closed in the match against Worcestershire, in an attempt to safeguard passage through to the quarter-final on run rate: the county was subsequently disqualified from the competition at a special meeting of the Test and County Cricket Board. Rose also captained the side to the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 1981 and 1982, and the renamed NatWest Trophy (formerly the Gillette Cup) in 1983. In September 1983, in the NatWest final at Lord's, Somerset beat Kent to win the trophy for the first time in their history.\nControversy returned to Somerset in the mid-1980s. With the successful side ageing, new captain Peter Roebuck led the move to make changes and the overseas stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner were sacked, replaced by the New Zealander Martin Crowe. Ian Botham resigned from Somerset in protest and moved to Worcestershire.\nRecent years.\nSuccess has been elusive in recent years, although New Zealand born Andy Caddick and opener Marcus Trescothick have proved major pillars of the England Test team and overseas stars such as Jamie Cox have given sterling service for the club, resulting in their appearance in the NatWest Trophy final in 1999 and the C &amp; G Trophy final in 2001 and 2002, winning in 2001 over Leicestershire. In 2001, the team finished second in the first division of the County Championship, its highest-ever placing. But true to its contrary traditions, the county was relegated to the second division at the end of the following season.\nUnder the guidance of the Director of Cricket Brian Rose, the team has adopted a youth policy, which Rose accepts will lead to a succession of good and bad results in the short term. To balance the youth policy, for two seasons the club was led by high-profile overseas stars Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith to enable coaching of the young group of players. In July 2005, as perhaps a portent of better times to come, the county was the surprise winner of the third Twenty20 Cup, beating Lancashire in the final at The Oval.\nThe 2006 season was up and down in results, but in June 2006 Rose announced the signing for six weeks of the Australian cricket team opening batsman Justin Langer, while countryman Dan Cullen was on duty with Australia A. Langer responded by hitting the highest score in the county's first-class history, but without him, the team struggled in both short and long versions of the game, failed to repeat their Twenty20 success and languished at or near the bottom of both County Championship and Pro40 second division tables.\nIn 2007 Langer, having returned to the team, was named captain. Cameron White was the other overseas player. Somerset's season began brightly, including a county-record 850/7 declared against Middlesex in their first Championship match, but a few weeks later Somerset were on the wrong end of a huge total when they conceded 801/8 declared to Derbyshire. However, they recovered well from this setback and achieved promotion, returning to Division One of the Championship for the first time since 2002, after beating Essex at Chelmsford with five sessions to spare. They were also promoted to Division One of the Pro40 league.\nWhile 2008 was an improved season, 2009 brought marginally less success. Langer announced his retirement from all forms of cricket at the end of the 2009 season, making the 2009 Champions League Twenty20 in India his last competitive competition for the club.\n2010–15.\nOn the departure of Justin Langer, Marcus Trescothick was named as club captain for the 2010 season. It was a memorable season for Somerset, although somewhat bitter-sweet. In one of the most successful seasons in the club's history, Somerset finished as runners-up in all major domestic competitions. In August the club went down to Hampshire in the Friends Provident t20 final, after failing to effect a run-out from the last ball that would have secured them the title. In the County Championship, they finished second to Nottinghamshire. While level on points at the close of play on the last day of the Championship season, Nottinghamshire lifted the title by virtue of more wins during the year. They were then beaten by Warwickshire in the Clydesdale Bank 40 final.\nIn the 2011 season, Somerset again performed well in all three domestic competitions finishing 4th in the County Championship, and runners up again in the Twenty20 competition to Leicestershire and also in the CB40 final to Surrey. Taunton-born keeper-batsman Jos Buttler secured a call up for England for 20/20 cricket. By virtue of finishing runners up in the domestic Twenty20 competition, Somerset qualified for the T20 Champions League competition in India featuring many of the world's best 20/20 teams. Roelof van der Merwe returned as their overseas player for this competition. Somerset performed exceptionally well, progressing from the preliminary round to the semi-final where they lost to the Mumbai Indians, in the process picking up considerable prize money.\nDuring the 2012 season, Somerset were ravaged by injuries to the extent that on two occasions the county were reduced to their last 11 available players, with members of the coaching and support staff having to fill in as 12th men. Despite this it was another successful season with Somerset again finishing runners-up in the Championship, though they finished 24 points behind the winners, only losing one match all year. Nick Compton carried a batting lineup that at times missed key players such as Trescothick and Craig Kieswetter due to injury, averaging an incredible 99.25. In one-day competitions, Somerset couldn't quite make up for a poor start in the CB40, losing their first 4 games, before winning their next 6 completed matches and narrowly missing out on the semi-finals. In the reformatted t20, Somerset topped their group and won the home quarter-final against Essex to send them on another trip to finals day, only to fall short to Hampshire in the semi-final.\nIn 2013, Somerset took a backward step in the Championship, as the batting lineup largely struggled. A late win over Surrey in September, the side's first and only Championship win at Taunton all year, basically assured them of safety and Somerset ended up in 6th place. Somerset found much better success in the one-day formats, topping their group in the YB40, winning 8 out of their 12 games only to be bowled out for just 119 in the semi-final and lose by 8 wickets. Peter Trego was the tournament's leading run-scorer with 745 including 2 hundreds and 5 fifties in 12 innings. The now familiar pattern of success in the group stages and disappointment in the latter stages was repeated in the t20 as Somerset were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Surrey. Before the season Brian Rose's tenure as Director of Cricket ended and he was replaced by David Nosworthy.\nSomerset had an indifferent 2014, as they failed to make much headway in the Championship and, for the first time since 2007, weren't able make the knockout stages of either one-day competition. Somerset again placed 6th in the Championship, although they were in no danger of relegation unlike the previous season. The beginning of the season had seen the departure of crowd favourite Buttler to Lancashire, and towards the end was marred by what turned out to be a career-ending eye injury to Kieswetter.\n2015.\nBefore the start of the 2015 season, plenty of changes took place at the club. Matthew Maynard stepped into the role of Director of Cricket after the club parted ways with Nosworthy. With the loss of Kieswetter, Somerset also lost another senior batsman in Compton as he moved back to London. Alfonso Thomas became captain in one-day competitions with Trescothick remaining as club and First-class captain. Somerset also made some new signings, including Chris Gayle for the start of the t20 Blast. For the most part, the season followed much the same path as the last, with Somerset failing to reach the latter stages of either limited overs competition and battling for the lower places in the Championship. Despite Gayle providing 328 runs in his three innings with the club, Somerset languished second from bottom in the t20 Blast. With Thomas sent out on loan, new signing Jim Allenby took over the captaincy for the One-Day Cup and despite winning their last three matches, Somerset missed out on a quarter-final spot. In the Championship Somerset looked to be in relegation trouble for much of the season, but led by a late run of form from Trescothick and thanks to a maximum points victory in their final game, Somerset avoided the drop by a margin of 22 points and finished 6th in Division One for the third consecutive year. James Hildreth was the leading Championship run-scorer in Division One.\n2016.\nThe 2016 season saw dramatic improvements in two of the three competitions. Chris Rogers was brought in to captain the Championship side on a one-year basis, and having been mid-table for most of the season, Somerset went on a late surge which put them right in contention for the title going into the last round of matches. Somerset defeated Nottinghamshire in their match, with Rogers scoring tons in both innings of the last game of his career, but needed Middlesex and Yorkshire to draw their match on the final day. With the game drifting, Yorkshire employed declaration bowling in order to allow Middlesex to set a target. However, as the close neared, it became clear that Yorkshire were not going to reach the target and Middlesex appeared not to have quite enough time to bowl Yorkshire out. In heartbreaking fashion, Yorkshire's lower order collapsed to hand Middlesex the title and leave Somerset finishing runners-up. Somerset had four batsmen reach 1000 runs in the Championship, those being Trescothick, Hildreth, Rogers and for the first time in his career, Peter Trego. Spinner Jack Leach claimed 65 wickets, finishing second in the Division One wicket takers list. Somerset enjoyed a good run of success in the One-Day Cup too, reaching the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions Warwickshire. Captain Jim Allenby was the leading run-scorer, passing 50 in five of his ten innings in the competition. Lewis Gregory and Tim Groenewald both performed well enough to qualify for the South team for the inaugural North v South one-day series at the start of the next season. In stark contrast, Somerset's t20 Blast campaign was disastrous, the club finished bottom of the South Group and lost their last seven games in a row.\n2017.\nBefore the 2017 season, Somerset announced that at the age of 22, Tom Abell would be appointed as club and Championship captain. Somerset made a disastrous start to the Championship, losing four of their first six games of the season. Despite a victory in the seventh game against Yorkshire at Scarborough, Somerset's prospects of survival looked very poor indeed at the halfway mark of the season. A strong draw against Surrey was followed by victories against Warwickshire and Lancashire, and although Somerset lost their penultimate game against Surrey, their fate was still in their own hands. Somerset needed to beat Middlesex in the final match of the year at Taunton with one more bonus point than their opponents to assure safety. Thanks to a 9-wicket match haul from Jack Leach on a turning pitch, and a century from James Hildreth in the second innings, Somerset comfortably beat Middlesex by 231 runs to condemn last year's champions to relegation, and ensure their 10-year run in Division One would continue for another season. Leach finished with 51 wickets, while Craig Overton's 46 wickets were enough to see him called up for that winter's Ashes tour. As a mark of how the batting unit struggled, overseas player Dean Elgar was the only batsman to average over 36 with the bat, and Elgar was absent from the second half of the season. New signing Steven Davies was the leading run scorer with 775. Somerset again enjoyed good success in the One-Day Cup, winning five of seven completed matches and qualifying second in the South Group for a home quarter-final against Nottinghamshire. Somerset lost an incredible game in which 834 runs were scored, falling short of Nottinghamshire's 429/9 by 24 runs. Elgar also enjoyed great success in this competition, scoring 519 runs in the 6 games he played. Somerset were again involved in a thriller in the final round of games of the t20 Blast, where a 98-run victory against Hampshire saw them through to the quarter-finals by 0.07 on Net run rate for the first time since 2013. Somerset faced a difficult trip to Trent Bridge, and lost to Nottinghamshire by 5 wickets. At the end of the year it was announced that both one-day captain Jim Allenby and Director of Cricket Matthew Maynard would not be returning for 2018.\n2018.\nUnder new director of cricket Andy Hurry, who returned to the club, and new head coach Jason Kerr, Somerset enjoyed an excellent start to their 2018 Championship campaign, winning three of their first five matches whilst drawing the other two. However, a heavy innings defeat to Surrey in the next round proved to be pivotal, as Surrey would go on to run away with the Championship title winning 10 of their 14 matches. Nonetheless, Somerset themselves won 7 games and only lost twice, but were consigned to yet another runners-up finish. James Hildreth broke the 1000 run barrier, whilst Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton finished with 37 wickets each. Somerset struggled to find consistency in their One-Day Cup campaign, but nevertheless entered the final round of matches with a chance to qualify for a playoff. Despite winning their final game against eventual champions Hampshire, Essex secured the win they needed to reach the playoffs in place of Somerset. The 2018 season saw Somerset take a further step forward in their t20 cricket under new t20 captain Gregory, as they reached finals day for the first time in 6 years. Despite losing two of their first three games, Somerset ended up finishing top of the South Group, winning 10 of their 14 matches to earn a home quarter-final and a chance to exact revenge for the previous year on Nottinghamshire. They were able do so, winning by 19 runs on a reserve day due to the weather, sending them to finals day. There Somerset lost out to Sussex in the semi-final by 35 runs as Sussex were able to put a sizeable score of 202 on the board. The improved performance in the competition was in no small part due to the impact of overseas signings Corey Anderson, who was the team's leading run-scorer with 514 runs at a strike-rate of 169.1, and Jerome Taylor who claimed 22 wickets in his 11 matches. Jamie Overton was Somerset's leading wicket-taker with 24 in his 16 games.\n2019.\n2019 was to prove to be the year Somerset finally broke their 14-year trophy drought, as they claimed victory in the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup, to end a run of 10 runners-up finishes across all formats over a 10-year span. The campaign began in brilliant style as Somerset secured their largest-ever List A margin of victory by beating Kent by 264 runs in their opening match. Victories in their next three games including a win against Essex in the first-ever game played under the new permanent floodlights at the County Ground, meant at the halfway stage in the competition, qualification to the knockout stages seemed assured. However, defeats in their next three including a resounding loss to Hampshire, who chased a target of 216 in the 32nd over, left Somerset needing a win in their final game just to make it into an away play-off game. They were able to defeat Surrey by 5 wickets, setting up a play-off game against Worcestershire at New Road. A century from Tom Banton, and a five-wicket haul from overseas player Azhar Ali saw Somerset to a comfortable win by 147 runs. In the semi-final, Somerset once again faced Nottinghamshire in a knockout game, at Trent Bridge. Somerset posted exactly the same score of 337 as they had in the play-off match, and the total once again proved to be more than enough, as Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 222, meaning Somerset reached the Lord's final where they would face defending champions Hampshire. Hampshire won the toss and chose to bat but Somerset, thanks mainly to the opening spell of Josh Davey and eventual man-of-the-match Jamie Overton in the middle overs, were able to take wickets at regular intervals, and despite a ninth-wicket stand of 64, Hampshire's total of 244/8 looked to be short of what would be required. This proved to be even more the case when Banton and Azhar Ali put on an opening partnership of 112, and despite losing both in quick succession, Somerset always looked in control. Fittingly the winning runs were scored by James Hildreth, who had also hit the winning runs as a 20-year-old in Somerset's last trophy win in 2005.\nClub officials.\nAdministration and coaching history.\nPresidents.\nThose who have held the office of Somerset President are:"

        "title": "Essex County Cricket Club",
        "text": "Essex County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Essex. \nFounded in 1876, the club had minor county status until 1894 when it was promoted to first-class status pending its entry into the County Championship in 1895. Since then, the team has played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. \nEssex currently play all their home games at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. The club has formerly used other venues throughout the county including Lower Castle Park in Colchester, Valentines Park in Ilford, Leyton Cricket Ground, the Gidea Park Sports Ground in Romford, and Garon Park and Southchurch Park, both in Southend. \nThe limited overs team has previously been known as the Essex Eagles but now play simply as Essex.\nEarliest cricket in Essex.\nIt is almost certain that cricket reached Essex by the 16th century and that it developed during the 17th century with inter-parish matches being played. The first definite mention of cricket in connection with the county is a highly controversial match in 1724 between Chingford and Mr Edwin Stead's XI, which is recorded in \"The Dawn of Cricket\" by H. T. Waghorn. The venue is unknown but, if it was at Chingford, it is also the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex as well as by an Essex team. The game echoed an earlier one in 1718 as the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Mr Stead's team had the advantage. A court case followed and, as in 1718, it was ordered to be played out presumably so that all wagers could be fulfilled. We know that Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and that he ordered them to play it out on Dartford Brent, though it is not known if this was the original venue. The game was completed in 1726.\nThe earliest reference to a team called Essex is in July 1732 when a combined Essex &amp; Herts team played against the London Cricket Club. In July 1737, there was London v Essex at the Artillery Ground, London winning by 45 runs. In a return game at Ilford on 1 August 1737, Essex won by 7 runs. References are then occasional until 1785 when the Hornchurch Cricket Club became prominent. This club had a strong team that was representative of Essex as a county. However, the sources differed among themselves re whether the team should be called Essex or Hornchurch. But there is no doubt that Essex was a First-Class county from 1785 until 1794, after which the county strangely and abruptly disappeared from the records for a long time. An Essex CCC was formed and held fixtures in 1860 and held an Annual General Meeting in 1861, but no further reference is seen until 1876.\nClub history.\nEssex CCC were formed on 14 January 1876 at a meeting in the Shire Hall, Chelmsford. The new club did not become First-Class until 1894, playing its inaugural first-class match on 14, 15 &amp; 16 May 1894 against Leicestershire CCC at Leyton. It was the initial First-Class match played by either club, and Essex failed to win a match against any other county. In 1895, both of these clubs and Warwickshire CCC joined the County Championship. In the club's first championship match, of their first championship season, James Burns scored 114 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston and this was the first century for Essex in First-Class cricket. George Frederick Higgins scored the second championship century for Essex in the same match putting on 205 with Burns for the fourth wicket. The club made a high score of 692 against Somerset with the veteran Bunny Lucas scoring 145, but the most notable feat was by Walter Mead who took 17–119 against Hampshire CCC at Southampton.\nEssex improved rapidly from 1895, so that by 1897 they were in the running for the Championship, only losing it when Surrey beat them at Leyton. They fell off after this despite beating a fine Australian team on a dubious pitch in 1899, never finishing higher than sixth between 1899 and 1932. Their batting on Leyton's excellent pitches was generally good with the \"Essex Twins\" of Perrin and McGahey and the sound and skilful Jack Russell, but the bowling depended too much on Mead, Buckenham and later Douglas and when available Louden.\nWith the decline of these players, Essex fell to some of their lowest levels ever during the late 1920s. Their bowlers conceded over 40 runs a wicket in 1928 – about the highest ever with uncovered pitches. The emergence of Jack O'Connor, Stan Nichols and when available, the amateur fast bowlers Ken Farnes and Hopper Read, though, made Essex during the 1930s a dangerous if inconsistent side. They finished as high as fourth in 1933, and owing to their pace bowling maintained almost as high a standard up to the outbreak of war. The batting, however, tended to depend too much upon O'Connor and a number of amateurs who were rarely available, and Essex lost too many games to break the North's stronghold on the Championship.\nAfter World War II Essex fell off, taking their first wooden spoon in 1950. During this period it was left to Trevor Bailey to do all the pace bowling, and he was often unavailable due to Test calls, whilst spinner Peter Smith was frequently overbowled until he retired in 1951 – thus a strong batting line-up led by Bailey and Doug Insole could seldom win games. Not until 1957 did Essex come back into the top half of the table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.\nIn the 1970s, with overseas players now permitted, Essex were able to gradually strengthen their team to achieve much more than they ever had before. This decade saw the advent of Graham Gooch, one of England's finest opening batsmen, even though he began his Test career with a pair against Australia in 1975. He didn't return to the England team until 1978, but after a slow start began to assert his dominance over Test bowlers as he had on the county scene. Dedicated to training, he forced his burly physique through a tough regime to prolong his career long after some of his contemporaries had retired.\nAlong with Gooch, county captain and England batsman Keith Fletcher built a powerful eleven in the late 1970s that dominated domestic cricket from 1979 to 1992, when Essex won six of thirteen County Championship titles. The bowling in the first half of this period was borne by tireless left arm seamer John Lever and spinner and prankster Ray East. The South African Ken McEwan and Fletcher were the best batsmen after Gooch. As Lever declined, England all rounder Derek Pringle and fast bowler Neil Foster took over, whilst John Childs crossed from Gloucestershire to take over as the chief spinner.\nIn the 1990s, Essex had more internationals, including Nasser Hussain, who captained England in several series. Bowlers Mark Ilott and Peter Such earned caps, as well as wicket keeper James Foster. Ashley Cowan toured the West Indies in 1997/98 without playing an international match. Essex were also able to sign England fast bowlers Darren Gough and Alex Tudor, after they left Yorkshire and Surrey respectively.\nLed by all-rounder Ronnie Irani Essex won the National League Division 1 title in 2005, their first major title in eight years.\nIn 2006, Essex successfully defended their National League title in the newly rebranded Pro40 format by the narrowest of margins, having tied for the title on points. The club missed out on promotion in the County Championship only on the last day of the season, losing to Leicestershire while their rivals Worcestershire beat Northamptonshire. In that season's Twenty20 Cup Essex beat Yorkshire to reach the semi-finals at Trent Bridge, where they were beaten by eventual tournament winners Leicestershire. Essex also had Twenty20 success in the first floodlit Twenty20 Tournament, held between the four teams with permanent floodlights, in a series of 2 legged matches. Essex beat Derbyshire 1–0, after the first leg was washed out, and they won the second leg convincingly.\nEssex was promoted back to Division one for the 2010 season. Essex won the County Championship in 2017 and 2019, and won the Bob Willis Trophy in 2020. Essex won the 2019 T20 Blast, beating Worcestershire Rapids in the final. Captain and player of the match Simon Harmer hit the winning runs and took 3-16.\nHome grounds.\nThe club currently plays all its home games at Chelmsford – Colchester's cricket festival has been suspended since the 2017 season.\nPlayers.\nEssex players with international caps.\nEssex county cricketers who have during their career also represented their national team in Test cricket, One Day International cricket or Twenty20 International cricket.\nEngland\nIndia\nBangladesh\nAustralia\nPakistan\nNetherlands\nZimbabwe\nSouth Africa\nWest Indies\nNew Zealand\nRecords.\nMost first-class runs for Essex \nQualification – 20,000 runs\nMost first-class wickets for Essex \nQualification – 1,000 wickets"

        "text": "Oxford University Cricket Club (OUCC), which represents the University of Oxford, had held first-class status since 1827 when it made its debut in the inaugural University Match between OUCC and Cambridge University Cricket Club (CUCC). Following the 2021 University Match, OUCC lost its first-class status. It was classified as a List A team in 1973 only. Home fixtures are played at the University Parks slightly northeast of Oxford city centre.\nHistory.\nThe earliest reference to cricket at Oxford is in 1673. OUCC made its known debut in the inaugural University Match between Oxford and Cambridge played in 1827. In terms of extant clubs being involved, this is the oldest major fixture in the world: i.e., although some inter-county fixtures are much older, none of the current county clubs were founded before 1839 (the oldest known current fixture is Kent \"versus\" Surrey).\nThe Magdalen Ground was used for the University Cricket Club's first match in 1829, and remain in regular use until 1880. Bullingdon Green was used for two matches in 1843. The University Parks became the home ground of OUCC in 1881, when the Master of Pembroke, Evan Evans obtaining a lease on 10 acres of land there. The pavilion was designed by Thomas G. Jackson, architect of many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Oxford buildings, including the university's Examination Schools. The building has three gables, the central one containing the clock, and is topped by a cupola and weather-vane. The pavilion contains a Long Room. The two ends of the pitch are the Pavilion End and the Norham Gardens End.\nThe University Match is now the club's sole first-class fixture each season. Apart from this annual game, played in late June or early July, OUCC operates as part of the Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (UCCE), which includes Oxford Brookes University. The UCCE was rebranded as Oxford MCC University (MCCU) prior to the 2010 season. The University Match is the only one in which a true OUCC team takes part: i.e., composed entirely of current Oxford students.\nThe Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (OUCCE) team played 26 first-class matches (not including one abandoned) from 2001 to 2009. As Oxford Marylebone Cricket Club University, the team has played sixteen first-class matches from 2010 to 2016.\nGrounds.\nThe five grounds that Oxford University have used for home first-class and List A matches since 1829 are listed below, with statistics complete through to the end of the 2014 season. Only the first-class and List A matches played at the ground by Oxford University are recorded in the table."

        "title": "Cambridge University Cricket Club",
        "text": "Cambridge University Cricket Club, established in 1820, is the representative cricket club for students of the University of Cambridge. Depending on the circumstances of each individual match, the club has always been recognised as holding first-class status. The university played List A cricket in 1972 and 1974 only. It has not played top-level Twenty20 cricket.\nWith some 1,200 members, home matches are played at Fenner's. The club has three men's teams (Blues, Crusaders and the Colleges XI) and one women's team (from the incorporation of Cambridge University Women's Cricket Club (CUWCC) in 2000) which altogether play nearly 100 days of cricket each season. The inaugural University Match between Cambridge and Oxford University Cricket Club was played in 1827 and the match was the club's sole remaining first class fixture each season until 2020.\nThe club has also operated as part of the Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Cambridge UCCE) which included players from Cambridge University and was Anglia Polytechnic University, now Anglia Ruskin University. This was re-branded as the Cambridge MCC University (Cambridge MCCU) prior to the 2010 season, when its governance was transferred from the England and Wales Cricket Board to MCC. Both male and female teams played in the British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport competitions and the men also took part in the MCC Universities Championship and Twenty20 competitions. In 2020, the MCCU competitions were cancelled due to Coronavirus restrictions and funding from MCC ceased. The MCCU teams played in 2021 as UCCEs once more. Cambridge University Cricket Club, without support from ARU, continues to compete in the National League against other UCCEs, with players selected only from Cambridge University.\nThe club also oversees and manages the annual inter-college 'Cuppers' cricket competition.\nThe earliest reference to cricket at the University of Cambridge is in 1710. A Cambridge University team played against an Eton College team in 1754 and 1755, although those were minor matches. It is not known if the Eton teams were of present or past pupils. Cambridge University began an annual series against Cambridge Town Club, which evolved into the original Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club, on 30 May 1817. It is with this game that both teams first acquired first-class status.\nAll Cambridge teams play annual matches against Oxford as well as other matches throughout the Lent and Summer terms. The first team four-day University Match retained its first-class status until 2020 and alternates between being held at Fenner's and The Parks. The one-day matches for men and women are currently played at Arundel. The Crusaders play a three-day game against the Authentics as well as one-day and Twenty20 games.\nCricket at Cambridge University.\nPlayers who represent Cambridge in the University Match against Oxford are awarded a \"Blue\", which recognises sporting achievement at the highest level whilst a student at the university. , Cambridge meets Oxford at Lord's in first-class and limited-overs matches, and a \"Blue\" is awarded to anyone who plays for Cambridge in either fixture.\nThose representing the (in recent years considered the Second XI) are eligible for a \"Crusaders' Colour\" if they represent the Crusaders against Oxford's Authentics. Despite a large winter training-squad, and many players representing the university over the summer months (up to 50 players from the training squad and college level), rarely are more than a total of 12 Blues and 12 Colours awarded. Women cricketers are awarded a Half-Blue for playing in the one-day match against Oxford and a discretionary full Blue if any of them meet the relevant criteria laid down by the Blues Committee.\nCricket is also played between the constituent colleges of Cambridge University. This currently takes the form of a cup competition 'Cuppers'. However, the colleges also play a range of their own friendly fixtures. Over the years, a number of independent student clubs have been formed such as Magpies, Chaffinches, Crusaders, Inexpressibles, Quidnuncs, Perambulators and Etceteras, to name a few and they have played fixtures against the colleges and other wandering sides.\nRecent history.\nIn recent Oxford versus Cambridge University matches, the honours have been fairly even between the two Universities. In 2010 Cambridge University played Oxford in three matches for the first time: Twenty20, 4-Day First-Class and the 1-Day Match at Lord's (note that colours are not awarded for the Twenty20 game).\nThe Cambridge Centre of Cricketing Excellence (UCCE) team has played 27 first-class matches between 2001 and 2009. Subsequently, as the Cambridge Marylebone Cricket Club University, three First Class fixture were played each season until 2014 when this was reduced to two. In 2019, the ECB announced that the Cambridge games (among other university games) was set to lose first-class status by 2021.\nGrounds.\nThe three grounds that Cambridge University Cricket Club has used for home first-class and List A matches since 1821 are listed below, with statistics complete through to the end of the 2014 season.

Young turned down a scholarship offer from Louisiana State University to sign with the Pirates.\nYoung advanced steadily through the system, but before the 2004 season, the Pirates released him. He was claimed on waivers by the Orioles and assigned to their Class AA affiliate, the Bowie Baysox. Young recovered from a slow start in Bowie to hit 33 home runs and appeared in the Eastern League All-Star Game. In 2005, he participated in the Orioles' spring training and started the regular season with the Orioles' Class AAA affiliate, the Ottawa Lynx.\nYoung was called up to the Orioles on September 1, 2005, after batting .288 with 13 home runs and 81 RBIs at Ottawa. Since 2005 was the last year that he could be optioned to the minors without having to pass through waivers, the Orioles said upon promoting him that they would use him in September to see if he fit into their plans for 2005. Young played 10 games for the Orioles in 2005, finishing with a .303 (10 for 33) batting average, 1 home run, and 3 RBIs. In the offseason, Young played for the Tiburones de La Guaira club of the Venezuelan Winter League.\nIn January 2006, Young was designated for assignment by the Orioles, after the O's had signed first basemen Russell Branyan and Rafael Palmeiro. Young was then claimed off waivers by the San Diego Padres, but faced much competition for the first base job: although their regular first baseman, Mike Piazza, started the season on the disabled list, Young did not win a spot on the major league roster out of spring training; Adrián González became their starting first baseman instead. Young was sent to the Padres' Class AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers, where he shared the first-base job. He started the season in a slump; and on April 25, 2006, the Padres released him.\nOn May 8, the Houston Astros signed Young and assigned him to their Class AA affiliate, the Corpus Christi Hooks, where he spent the rest of the season hitting .277/.309/.410 with 10 home runs and 60 RBI and alongside Hunter Pence lead the team to a Texas League championship.\nOn March 29, 2007, the independent Winnipeg Goldeyes signed Young. Young spent the full 2007 season with the Goldeyes, batting .313 with 21 home runs and 78 RBIs The Goldeyes exercised Young's 2008 option following the season, but instead he signed with the Sussex Skyhawks. Later in 2008, Young moved to the Sioux City Explorers and helped lead the team to the American Association playoffs, where he hit .367 with 5 home runs and 29 RBIs in 26 games.\nIn January 2009, Young re-signed with Sioux City and played for the Explorers until the end of June. In July, he signed to play for the Edmonton Capitals of the Golden Baseball League. After about a month there, he was released on August 17 to make room in the dugout. He began playing semi-pro baseball with his hometown Hattiesburg Black Sox in 2010.\nPost-baseball career.\nYoung, who had planned to pursue a degree in criminal justice with LSU before signing with the Pirates, joined the Forrest County Sheriff's Department and began working as a shift sergeant at the county jail. As of 2010, he was pursuing a degree from the online University of Phoenix.\nYoung died on September 19, 2015, of a heart attack. He weighed at the time of his death."

        "title": "Senior major golf championships",
        "text": "Men's professional senior golf is for players aged 50 and above. Golf differs from all other sports in having lucrative competitions for this age group. The leading senior tour is the U.S.-based PGA Tour Champions, which was established in 1980 (as the Senior PGA Tour). It has established a roster of five major championships. These events are all played over four rounds, whereas other senior tournaments are generally played over three rounds—only one other current Champions Tour event, the limited-field and season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship, is played over four rounds. A golfer's performances can be quite variable from one round to the next, so playing an extra round increases the likelihood that the senior majors will be won by leading players.\nIn the current order of play, the senior majors are:\nThe Senior PGA Championship, U.S. Senior Open, and Senior Open Championship, have fields of 144 to 156 players and a 36-hole cut. The Tradition and Senior Players Championship have 81 player fields and no 36-hole cut.\nThe order of play has changed many times during the history of senior golf, especially since 2006:\nUnlike the mainstream majors, two of the senior majors have title sponsors, and the Senior PGA Championship and Senior Open have presenting sponsors whose names appear after the tournament title. Also unlike the mainstream majors, none of which falls under the direct jurisdiction of any professional tour, the Champions Tour directly operates two of its majors—The Tradition and the Senior Players Championship. The other three senior majors are operated by the same bodies that organize their mainstream counterparts—the PGA of America for the Senior PGA, The R&amp;A for the Senior Open, and the USGA for the U.S. Senior Open.\nThe Senior PGA is by far the oldest of the senior majors, having commenced in the 1930s. The other four tournaments all date from 1980 or later, having been founded in the era when senior golf became a commercial success. This occurred when the first big golf stars of the television era, men such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, began to reach the relevant age.\nUnlike mainstream men's golf, the senior game does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The three majors recognized by the European Senior Tour are the Senior PGA Championship and the U.S. and British Senior Opens. However, the Champions Tour is much more dominant in global senior golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men's golf.\nSenior major winners.\nThe table below shows the results of all the events designated as majors by the Champions Tour. As the order in which the majors were played frequently changes, they are listed in the current order of play. Winners of Senior PGA Championships played before December 1979 (from the 1980 to 1985 seasons, it was the winner of the Senior PGA Championship if the previous calendar year) and Senior Opens played before 2003 are not listed here as they were not Champions Tour majors at the time nor retroactively recognized as majors. Those winners are shown in the tournaments' articles. The other three tournaments have been Champions Tour majors throughout their existence. From 1979 to 1983, and again in 1984, the Senior PGA Championship for that season was held in December of the previous year (the 1979 season tournament was held in February; the 1980 season tournament was held in December 1979, and this was the case until the 1983 season; it was repeated in the 1985 season), similar to a wraparound season in other sports.\nBernhard Langer holds the record for the most senior majors won with twelve. Gary Player has also won nine championships that are now considered senior golf majors, but three of his titles came at the Senior Open Championship before this tournament officially gained senior major status. Jack Nicklaus has won eight senior majors and holds the record for the most regular majors won (18).\nBernhard Langer is the only player to have won each of the five senior major championships and is therefore held to have won the 'Career Grand Slam.' In his time, Nicklaus also held a 'Career Grand Slam' as the Senior Open did not become the fifth senior major until 2003, by which time Nicklaus had effectively retired from senior golf (his only appearance in the Senior Open was in 2003).\n\"NOTE: The Senior PGA Championship was held in December from 1979 to 1984, with one exception. For consistency reasons of golf seasons, which at times have been wraparound seasons before the tournament moved to late May, December tournament of the Senior PGA Championship are regarded as the following year's season.\"\nBy country.\nSource:"

        "title": "The Wedge (surfing)",
        "text": "The Wedge is a spot located at the extreme southeast end of the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, California known for its large waves that makes it a popular spot for surfing and bodysurfing. The Wedge is located at the intersection of the beach and the man-made jetty that forms the breakwater on the western side of Newport harbor entrance. When a south or south/southwest swell is running in the right size and direction, the Wedge can produce waves up to high.\nThe waves.\nThe waves are a by-product of alterations to the rock jetty on the west side of the Newport Harbor entrance undertaken during the 1930s. When conditions are right, and a wave approaches the shore at the proper angle (most generally a south swell), an approaching wave will reflect off the jetty creating a second wave. The reflected wave meets up with the following wave of the set and forms a peak, and this pattern can repeat for several following waves as well. If the reflected and incoming waves align the resulting wave is bigger than either alone due to constructive interference. This occurs very rapidly and forms waves in a very unpredictable and \"unstable\" pattern, so that no two waves are alike and the exact breaking point is difficult to predict even for an experienced surfer.\nAlthough this condition primarily occurs with large, south swells, it can also occur, with considerably lesser frequency, during \"normal\" conditions. During a south or south/southwest swell of the right size and aligned in the swell window, the Wedge can produce huge waves up to high.\nIn addition, the beach at the Wedge is very steeply shaped sand, resulting in what is known as shore break and a very strong backwash which often drags people back into the surf. The backwash itself frequently creates another, outgoing wave, which can hit an incoming wave or surfer with enormous force. With the combined effect of the unpredictability of where the incoming waves will break, and the strength of the backwash, the resulting wave action can be highly unpredictable and therefore both exciting as well as very dangerous. The combination of danger, along with the chance to get pitted (enclosed in the tube, barrel, or \"pit\" of a wave), draws many to surf the Wedge.\nThe Wedge breaks largest when intense Southern Hemisphere storms or large tropical cyclones send their long period energy from the south-southwest direction, primarily during the summer and fall months.\nHistory.\nThe formation of the surfing spot known as the Wedge was a by-product of alterations to the Newport Harbor, which were completed and re-dedicated on May 23, 1936. Before those renovations and extensions of the West Jetty wall, the Newport Harbor was the premier surfing spot on the entire west coast of North America. However, while the Newport Harbor was popular with surfers, it was also at that time a tragic place to be for boaters and swimmers alike, especially during big swells.\nIn 1926, George Rogers Jr., a 15-year-old with polio, drowned in the Newport Harbor as his boat capsized amidst the heavy waves. As a result of polio, George Rogers Jr. was reliant on leg braces, and due to the weight of his heavy iron leg braces, his body sank to the bottom of the harbor and was never found. To prevent such a tragedy from happening again to boaters or swimmers, the boy's father, George Rogers Sr., a successful southern California road builder, was motivated to sell his business and focus his remaining years of life on seeking local and federal funding to alter the Newport Harbor. From 1926 to 1936 George Rogers Sr. campaigned to raise funds. Despite the scarcity of money during the Depression, Rogers Sr., helped raise approximately $2 million in federal aid and local bond funds.\nA month following the re-dedication of the improved Newport Harbor entrance, George Rogers Sr. had a heart attack while on his boat as he entered the harbor entrance. He died at approximately the same location his son died, ten years earlier. In 2014 the documentary, \"The Wedge: Dynasty, Tragedy, Legacy\", aired on PBS SoCaL, recounting these events.\nPopular culture.\nIn the early to mid-1950s The Wedge was known locally as \"102 Beach,\" where teens held frequent evening beach parties at which Brew 102, a popular (and inexpensive) Southern California beer from the Maier Brewing Co. was liberally consumed. The Wedge makes an appearance in Bruce Brown's \"The Endless Summer\". Balboa is mentioned in the opening song to seminal 1963 surfing movie \"Beach Party\".\nLegendary surf music guitarist Dick Dale memorialized the Wedge in an eponymous song on the 1963 album, Checkered Flag. Pop punk band All Time Low also mentions the Wedge in their song \"Let It Roll\" from their 2007 album, \"So Wrong, It's Right\".\nJohn Wayne attended USC in the 1920s, where he played on the Trojans football team. \"While still playing football, Wayne went to the Wedge for a bodysurfing session and wound up — as so many others do — getting injured at the famously fast and heavy spot. Because he could no longer play football, he lost his athletic scholarship. And without funds, he had to drop out of USC. After leaving school, Wayne went to work at the studios, beginning with a summer gig in a prop department.\""

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball players from Australia",
        "text": "The first recorded baseball event in Australia took place in Melbourne, Victoria in 1857, between teams from Collingwood and Richmond. Accounts vary as to the details, including whether it was a single game or a series of three games, though details in common include a score of 350–230 in favour of Collingwood, and that the rules used were some form of hybrid between cricket and baseball, with teams batting until all players were out, and runs being scored for every base crossed, rather than just for reaching home plate. Though there are no records to confirm it, the commonly held belief is that baseball in Australia originated on the Ballarat gold-fields among American miners. The Claxton Shield, the first annually recurring national tournament, commenced in 1934. Though the tournament itself has been supplanted at various points in its history, the physical Shield is still awarded to the national champions in the Australian Baseball League.\n, 36 Australians have played in at least one MLB game. Of those players, 33 were born in Australia, the remainder having been born elsewhere but raised in Australia and have played for the Australia national baseball team at International Baseball Federation or sanctioned tournaments such as the Olympic Games and World Baseball Classic. 24 of the players have been pitchers and the other 12 have been position players.\nAustralia became the sixth country (not counting the United States) to have a player represented in the major leagues, when Joe Quinn made his debut on 26 April 1884 for the St. Louis Maroons. Quinn also became the first Australian-born manager, as a player-manager for the St. Louis Browns in 1895. After Quinn played his last MLB game, it was almost 85 years before another Australian would appear in an MLB game: Craig Shipley on 22 June 1986 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The most recent Australian-born player to make his debut in the major leagues is Alexander Wells, who played for the Baltimore Orioles on 27 June 2021.\n, Grant Balfour, David Nilsson and Liam Hendriks are the only Australians to have played in an MLB All-Star Game. In 2013, Balfour was added to the squad by AL manager Jim Leyland as a 'Sunday replacement' pitcher. In 1999, Nilsson was one of two players from the Milwaukee Brewers to be selected. At this time the starting lineup was selected by the fans through voting at stadiums and online. The remaining players were selected by the managers of the respective teams, themselves having been the managers of the league champions from the previous season: in Nilsson's case, he was selected by Bruce Bochy, who had managed the San Diego Padres to the 1998 World Series against the New York Yankees. Liam Hendriks became the third Australian to make the MLB All-Star Game in 2019, as a replacement for Charlie Morton.\nTrent Durrington became the only Australian position player to pitch in an MLB game when he appeared for the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 April 2004 against the Houston Astros. Durrington had already entered the game initially as a pinch hitter and remained in the game playing at third base. With two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning, Durrington faced one hitter and induced a fly ball out.\nPostseason appearances.\nJoe Quinn became the first Australian to make an appearance in a postseason game for a Major League team, when the Boston Beaneaters met the Cleveland Spiders in a best-of-nine-game series between the season's first half and second half leaders. In 1892, the National League (NL) was the only active Major League, and Boston were already considered to be the NL pennant winners as they had the best record at the end of the season, and the series—won by the Beaneaters 5–0 (with one tie)—was considered an exhibition series.\nIn the modern era (considered to be from 1901 to today by MLB, as it was the first season with both of the current Major Leagues in operation), six Australians have played in postseason games, all but one of them pitchers. Graeme Lloyd became the first, playing with the New York Yankees in 1996. He made appearances against the Texas Rangers in the League Division Series, the Baltimore Orioles in the League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Lloyd was credited with the win in game 4 of the 1996 World Series, becoming the first Australian player to do so, as well as becoming the first Australian to be a World Series champion when the Yankees won in 1996 and again in 1998.\nGrant Balfour holds the record for most appearances in postseason games for an Australian, having played in a total of seventeen games, thirteen with the Tampa Bay Rays, two with the Minnesota Twins and two with the Oakland Athletics. Damian Moss and Peter Moylan also made postseason appearances, both having played for the Atlanta Braves against the San Francisco Giants: Moss in the 2002 National League Division Series, and Moylan in the 2010 National League Division Series. Liam Hendriks is the most recent Australian to play in the postseason, and the only such player to start a postseason game, pitching in the 2018 American League Wild Card Game for the Oakland Athletics."

        "title": "Ollie (skateboarding)",
        "text": "The ollie is a skateboarding trick where the rider and board leap into the air without the use of the rider's hands. It is the combination of stomping, also known as popping, the tail of the skateboard off the ground to get the board mostly vertical, jumping, and sliding the front foot forward to level out the skateboard at the peak of the jump.\nThe ollie is a fundamental skill in skateboarding. Ollies are necessary to leap onto, over, or off of obstacles. As most flip tricks depend on it, the ollie is often the first skill to be learned by a new skateboarder and typically takes considerable practice to learn.\nOrigin of the technique.\nIn 1978, Alan Gelfand, who was given his nickname \"Ollie\" by Scott Goodman, learned to perform frontside no-handed aerials in bowls and pools using a gentle raising of the nose and scooping motion to keep the board with the feet. There are numerous references to Alan Gelfand's ollie, most notably pictures in the 1970s skateboarding magazine \"Skateboarder\". Jeff Tatum is credited as the first person to perform a backside ollie in a bowl, which he initially named a \"JT air\". Both ollies were invented around the same time and it is unclear if the backside or frontside was done first, but Gelfand's frontside got the most initial media attention.\nAn April 1981 issue of Thrasher notes that the vert ollie was quickly adapted to flatground use, observing that \"skaters now hop effortlessly from street to sidewalk with just a tap of the tail.\" In 1982, while competing in the Rusty Harris contest in Whittier, California, Rodney Mullen debuted an ollie on flat ground, which he had adapted from Gelfand's vertical version by combining the motions of some of his existing tricks. Mullen used a \"see-saw\" motion, striking the tail of the board on the ground to lift the nose, and using the front foot to level the board in mid-air. While Mullen was not initially impressed with his flat ground ollie, and did not formally name it, the trick is now considered to have transformed the practice of skateboarding. Mullen himself realized it opened up a second, elevated plane on which to perform tricks, stating that \"Skating might easily have petered out due to lack of progress if nobody had invented this trick.\"\nRodney won the Rusty Harris contest, was afterwards asked by many riders to demonstrate the trick, and later in the year it would appear with the name \"Ollie-pop\" as a \"trick tip\" in the skateboarding magazine \"Thrasher\".\nThe flat ground ollie technique is strongly associated with street skateboarding; mini ramp and vert riders can also use this technique to gain air and horizontal distance from the coping, but half-pipe riders typically rely more on the board's upward momentum to keep it with the rider, more similar to Gelfand's original technique.\nExecution of the flatground ollie.\nThe rider begins the ollie by crouching and jumping directly upward. As the rider begins to leap, instead of lifting the feet from the board, they \"pop\" the tail by striking it against the ground while the rider jumps into the air, which raises the board nose-first. Maintaining contact with the board, the rider lifts the front leg and bends the front ankle so that the outer or top side of the shoe slides towards the nose of the board. The friction between the shoe and the board's grip tape helps to guide and pull the board upward, while the rear foot only maintains slight contact with board to help guide it. When nearing the peak of the jump, the rider lifts the rear leg and pushes the front foot forward, which levels the board and keeps it in contact with the back foot.\nThe skater can gain greater clearance from the ground by jumping higher, popping faster, sliding the front foot farther forwards (starting the jump with the front foot farther back), and pulling the legs higher into the chest to raise the feet higher. Skaters attempting record-setting ollies even contort the legs so that board and feet are not directly below them, allowing the board to rise at or just below the level of the pelvis.\nVery low ollies can be achieved using the same technique, but without the tail making contact with the ground. Even basic flip tricks can be achieved without the \"pop\" of the tail.\nThe principal components of an ollie are force and friction. The more energetically one pushes on the rear end of the skateboard, and the more friction generated by the foot sliding along the board, the higher the athlete will travel. Increasing the friction of the board's surface through the use of higher-grit deck tape would thus greatly increase performance, as would the development of the skill to more quickly and energetically slide one's foot along the board.\nRecords.\nThe highest unofficial ollie was 46.1 inches (117.0 cm) performed by Jack Asani at Hyde park, Sydney, Australia on the 4th of June 2023 in a small event held by Integrity Skateboard company.\nThe highest official flat ground ollies are generally performed in ollie contests.\nThe Guinness World Record for the greatest number of consecutive ollies is held by David Tavernor of Norwich, United Kingdom, who successfully performed 323 ollies on 23 August 2021. David beat the record despite being diagnosed with arthritis in 2015, winning a £5 bet with a professional comedian in doing so."

        "title": "Duckpin bowling",
        "text": "Duckpin bowling is a variation of the sport of bowling.\nDuckpin balls are in (12 cm) to 5 in (12.7 cm) in diameter, weigh 3 lb 6 oz (1.5 kg) to 3 lb 12 oz (1.7 kg) each, and lack finger holes. They are thus significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling but are slightly larger and heavier than those used in candlepin bowling.\nDuckpins, although arranged in a triangle identical to that used in ten-pin bowling, are shorter, slightly thinner, and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents, which makes it more difficult for the smaller ball to achieve a strike. For this reason, similar to candlepin bowling, the bowler is allowed three rolls per frame.\nRules.\nDuckpin bowling has rules similar to ten-pin bowling. In a 10-frame game, bowlers try to knock down pins in the fewest rolls per frame. Bowlers have three balls per frame, instead of two as in ten-pin bowling, to knock over a set of 10 pins. If a bowler knocks down all 10 pins with their first roll in a frame, it is scored as a \"strike\". If all the pins are knocked down in two rolls, the bowler has made a \"spare\". If all the pins are knocked down in three rolls, it is scored as a \"ten\", as in candlepins, with no bonus. If pins are still standing after the third ball, the bowler gets one point for each pin knocked down.\nIn the case of a strike, the bowler gets 10 points plus the total number of pins knocked down with the next two balls rolled, for a maximum of 30 points. In the case of a spare, the bowler gets 10 points plus the number of pins knocked down with the next ball, for a maximum of 20 points. If it takes three balls to knock down all 10 pins, the bowler gets 10 points, with no bonus. A bowler's final score is the sum of the points earned over 10 frames (a spare or strike in the tenth frame earns one or two rolls respectively). The maximum possible score of 300 points, which is accomplished by rolling 12 strikes in a row, has never been achieved under official conditions.\nDuckpin bowling lanes are the same size as ten-pin bowling lanes, but with smaller gutters.\nHistory.\nThe origin of duckpin bowling has been disputed. A commonly recited assertion is that the sport began in Baltimore around 1900, at a bowling, billiards and pool hall owned by future baseball Hall of Famers John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson, both of the old (1882–1899) Baltimore Orioles. One such claim is reported in the \"Pittsburgh Press\" of March 3, 1929. However, research has since found references to duckpin dating to the early 1890s in New Haven, Boston and Lowell, Mass. Author Howard W. Rosenberg wrote in 2005 that his research showed the sport was around \"at least as of 1894, and probably well before that\", with former \"Duckpin News\" editor Stacy Karten stating in a 2016 publication that Rosenberg found an 1892 reference to duckpin in \"The Boston Globe.\"\nDuckpins was not an organized sport until the National Duckpin Bowling Congress (NDBC) was founded in 1927.\nIn 1953, submarine designer Ken Sherman developed the first automatic duckpin pinsetter, its design having over 1,000 moving parts. Sherman's refusal to sell his patent to ten-pin competitor Brunswick caused him to lack corporate investment needed to manufacture large numbers of duckpin pinsetters. Further, no parts for the Sherman pinsetter have been manufactured since 1973, so that anyone wanting to open a new bowling center must cannibalize parts. The absence of new pinsetter machines is thought to curtail growth of the sport, and spare parts must be scavenged or obtained from alleys that have closed. Only one company makes duckpins, and it only leases them.\nThe executive director of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress said in 2016 that there were 41 congress-certified duckpin bowling alleys, down from nearly 450 in 1963. In comparison, there were about 4,000 ten-pin centers in 2018. \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported in 2017 that the number of professional duckpin bowlers is down by more than 90 percent.\nIn 1982, the Women's National Duckpin Association (WNDA) was formed, conducting tournaments for women to compete professionally, with Ladies Professional Duckpin Tournament (LPDT) events extending back at least as early as 1974.\nAccomplishments and record scores.\nIn 1999, \"Sports Illustrated\" named Elizabeth \"Toots\" Barger among the fifty top Maryland athletes of all time, Barger having claimed thirteen NDBC No. 1 rankings for having the highest female duckpinner average. Barger won nine world championships, and, in 1961, became the second woman to be inducted into the Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame.\nVariants.\nRubber band duckpins.\nIn 1905 a variant called rubber band duckpins was introduced in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area by William Wuerthele, in which the pins are circled with hard rubber bands to increase rebound action in collisions, and therefore scoring. Wuerthele observed bowlers wasting their third ball as well as flying pins injuring pin boys, so, according to a defunct publication called \"The Ducks\", Wuerthele added the rubber band to increase scoring.\nThe American Duckpin Congress was formed in the 1920s to govern the game of rubber band duckpins. The organization later became the American Rubber Band Duckpin Bowling Congress in 1945 and became an affiliate of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress. The rubber band game is now almost extinct, with most of the lanes located in private clubs, though there is one alley in the U.S. still open to the public in Glassport, Pennsylvania.\nAs of 2018, rubber band duckpins was mostly limited to Québec, where it is called \"petites quilles.\"\nThere have been perfect games bowled in rubber band duckpin, including the largest duckpin prize ever won on television, C$50,000 in 1994. Since it is easier to knock down pins in rubber band duckpin, its rules are identical to those of ten-pin bowling.\nMini duckpins.\nIn mini duckpins, the lane is shorter than a standard duckpin lane, and the width of the lane is not standard. While there has never been a sanctioned perfect game in regulation duckpin bowling, 300 games are said to be relatively common in mini duckpin play.\nComparison with ten-pin bowling.\nThe USBC reported that there were 55,266 certified 300 games in ten-pin bowling in the 2013–2014 season alone, but there has never been a certified 300 game in duckpin bowling. A Connecticut man named Pete Signore Jr. came closest with a 279 game in 1992."

In professional tennis, aces are generally seen on a player's first serve, where the server can strike the ball with maximum force and take more chances with ball placement, such as the far corners of the service box. According to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, this term was coined by the sports journalist Allison Danzig.\nProfessional singles records.\nAces have been officially recorded by the top-level professional tennis circuits since 1991, so these records start at that time.\nOnly main draw singles matches are included here.\nATP Tour.\nJohn Isner has the most aces in a tournament with 214 during the 2018 Wimbledon, and he has the most in a single match with 113 during his 11-hour encounter with Nicolas Mahut in 2010. John Isner has served the most aces with 14,470.\nIvo Karlović has the most in a best-of-three-set match with 45 at Halle in 2015. Two weeks later, during Wimbledon, he became the only player to hit at least 40 aces in three consecutive matches.\nGoran Ivanišević has the most in a single season with 1,477 in 1996. He also has the second most in a tournament with 213 when he won the 2001 Wimbledon title.\nRoger Federer hit 50 aces in the 2009 Wimbledon final, the record for a Grand Slam final. He is also third on the career list.\nWTA Tour.\nSerena Williams holds the record for most aces in a tournament with 102 en route to winning the 2012 Wimbledon title.\nKarolína Plíšková has the most aces in a single season with 530 in 2016, which broke her own record of 517 in 2015. She has also served the most aces in a match on clay, with 21 in her second round victory over Jeļena Ostapenko at Stuttgart in 2021.\nMost aces in a match.\nThere have been 32 matches played in which a player has served 20 or more aces, since 2008.\nHalf-ace.\nIn 1999, the Swedish artist and writer Kjell Höglund proposed a term for when an opponent manages to hit the ball without it actually entering into play. He suggested it should be called a \"half-ace\"."

It began on March 15, 2005, and ended with the championship game on April 4 at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis.\nThe Final Four consisted of top seed Illinois, in their first Final Four appearance since 1989, Louisville, making their first appearance since winning the national championship in 1986, North Carolina, reaching their first Final Four since their 2000 Cinderella run, and Michigan State, back in the Final Four for the first time since 2001.\nNorth Carolina emerged as the national champion for a fourth time, defeating Illinois in the final 75–70. North Carolina's Sean May was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. It was coach Roy Williams's first national championship.\nFor the first time since 1999, when Weber State defeated North Carolina, a #14 seed defeated a #3 seed when Bucknell upset Kansas. A #13 seed, Vermont, advanced by defeating Syracuse in the first round and a #12 seed, Wisconsin-Milwaukee, advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the Chicago region.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 65 teams entered the tournament, thirty having earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments. The automatic bid of the Ivy League, which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted \"at-large\" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\nTwo teams play an opening-round game, popularly called the \"play-in game,\" the winner of which advances to the main draw of the tournament and plays a top seed in one of the regionals. Since its inception in 2001, this game has been played at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio.\nAll 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regionals; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed.

It was a tight contest for much of the first half before an 8–0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35–25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40–27 lead into halftime. North Carolina increased its lead to 15 at one point in the second half. But Illinois began a furious charge: at one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10–0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70–70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Head, forcing Deron Williams to foul. However, Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws, giving Illinois one last chance. But Luther Head's three pointer bounced high and out. Eventually it went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75–70 victory. For North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying it at 37.

        "text": "The U.S. Mid-Amateur, often called the Mid-Am for short, is the leading annual golf tournament in the United States for post-college amateur golfers, organized by the USGA.\nIt was first played in at Bellerive Country Club in Creve Coeur, Missouri, near St. Louis. The Mid-Am was the first new USGA championship in 19 years, since the U.S. Senior Women's Amateur was added in 1962.\nQualifications for the Mid-Am are similar to those for the U.S. Amateur, except for the following:\nThe U.S. Mid-Amateur does not have a gender restriction, but there has never been a female champion. The USGA's analogous event for women only is the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur, first played in 1987.\nThe USGA specifically intended the Mid-Am as a championship for post-college golfers who were not pursuing golf as a career, as virtually all golfers who pursue a professional career decide to do so no later than their early twenties. This was most likely a response to the fact that less than half of all U.S. Amateur qualifiers are 25 or older, and most older golfers found themselves disadvantaged in competing against college golfers who typically play much more often. \nLike the U.S. Amateur, the Mid-Am consists of two days of stroke play, with the leading 64 competitors then playing a knockout competition held at match play to decide the champion. The profile of Mid-Am champions, with respect to age, is somewhat similar to that of U.S. Amateur champions before World War II. In that era, more top-level golfers chose to remain amateur, and the average age of U.S. Amateur Champions was higher.\nWhile the list of winners is considerably less illustrious than that of the U.S. Amateur, one notable winner was Jay Sigel, a three-time winner of this event and a two-time U.S. Amateur champion who went on to play the Champions Tour. The winner receives an automatic invitation to play in the Masters Tournament and the U.S. Open (starting in 2018)."

        "title": "Bowling ball",
        "text": "A bowling ball is a hard spherical ball used to knock down bowling pins in the sport of bowling.\nBalls used in ten-pin bowling and American nine-pin bowling traditionally have holes for two fingers and the thumb. Balls used in five-pin bowling, candlepin bowling, duckpin bowling, and European nine-pin bowling have no holes, and are small enough to be held in the palm of the hand.\nTen-pin balls.\nSpecifications.\nThe USBC and World Bowling promulgate bowling ball specifications. USBC specifications include physical requirements for weight (≤), diameter (—), surface hardness, surface roughness, hole drilling limitations (example: a single balance hole \"including\" the thumb hole for \"two-handed\" bowlers), balance, plug limitations, and exterior markings (structural and commercial), as well as requirements for dynamic performance characteristics such as radius of gyration (RG; 2.46—2.80), RG differential (≤0.06), and coefficient of friction (≤0.32). The USBC banned weight holes (balance holes) in competition, effective August 1, 2020, to prevent their changing ball dynamics. The USBC permits three ounces (85 grams) of static side weight and three ounces (85 grams) of top weight. These figures are up from one ounce (28 grams) following the August 1, 2020 rule change.\nCoverstock technology.\nBowling balls were made of lignum vitae (hardwood) until the 1905 introduction of rubber balls. Polyester (\"plastic\") balls were introduced in 1959 and, despite developing less hook-generating lane friction than rubber balls, by the 1970s plastic dominated over rubber balls. Briefly, \"soaker\" ball technology—involving softening coverstocks to achieve greater hook—were used, until rules for minimum hardness were implemented. The early-1980s development of polyurethane (\"urethane\") balls developed more friction with the newly developed polyurethane lane finishes of the day, sparking the evolution of coverstock technology to pursue ever-stronger hooks with correspondingly higher entry angles. \nThe early 1990s brought development of reactive resin (\"reactive\") balls by introducing additives in urethane surface materials to create microscopic oil-absorbing pores that increase the \"tackiness\" that enhances traction. In the \"particle-enhanced\" balls developed in the late 1990s, microscopic particles embedded in reactive coverstocks reach through oil lane coatings to provide even greater traction. Ball manufacturers developed closely guarded proprietary blends including ground-up material such as glass, ceramic or rubber, to enhance friction.\nWithin the reactive category are \"solid\" reactive coverstocks (having the greatest amount of microscopic pores), \"pearl\" reactive coverstocks (including mica additives that enhance reaction on dry lane surfaces), \"hybrid\" reactive coverstocks (combining the mid-lane reaction of solid coverstocks and the back-end reaction of pearl coverstocks), and \"particle\" coverstocks (including microscopic silica particles, favored for use on heavy oil volumes).\nHook potential has increased so much that dry lane conditions or certain spare shots sometimes cause bowlers to use plastic or urethane balls, to purposely avoid the larger hook provided by reactive technology.\nLayout and grip.\nA ball's \"drilling layout\" refers to how and where holes are drilled, in relation to the ball's locator pin and mass bias (MB) marker. Layout is determined with reference to each bowler's \"positive axis point\" (PAP; the pocket end of the ball's initial axis of rotation). \"Pin down\" layouts place the pin between the finger holes and the thumb hole, while \"pin up\" layouts place the pin further from thumb hole than the finger holes (see photos). Bowling ball motion is influenced by how far the pin and the mass bias (MB) are from the PAP, the distances determining \"track flare.\" Track flare—the sequence of oil rings showing migration of the ball's axis on successive revolutions through the oil pattern—is popularly thought to influence entry angle, but Freeman &amp; Hatfield (2018) discount its contribution to ball motion.\nHoles may be drilled for a \"conventional\" grip (fingers inserted to the second knuckle as with \"house balls\"), a \"fingertip\" grip (fingers inserted only to the first knuckle, enabling greater rev-generating torque), or less standard grips such as the \"Sarge Easter\" grip (ring finger inserted to the second knuckle but middle finger inserted only to the first knuckle). Many bowlers using the so-called \"two-handed delivery\" (which is still a \"one\"-handed \"release\") do not insert their thumbs, thus allowing their fingers to impart even more torque than the fingertip grip.\nFinger inserts and thumb slugs are custom-fit urethane tubes inserted into the drilled holes, generally for balls with a fingertip grip. Finger inserts enhance the torque provided by the fingers after the thumb exits the ball.\nBall motion.\nA complex interaction of a variety of factors influences ball motion and its effect on scoring results. The factors may be categorized as the bowler's delivery, the bowling ball's design, and the condition of the lane.\nStages of ball motion.\nBowling ball motion is commonly broken down into sequential skid, hook, and roll phases. As the ball travels down the lane in the skid and hook phases, frictional contact with the lane causes the ball's forward (\"translational\") speed to continually decrease, but to continually increase its rev rate (\"rotational\" speed). Especially as the ball encounters greater friction in the last ≈20 feet (approximate) of the lane, the ball's axis rotation (side rotation) causes the ball to hook away from its original direction. Concurrently, lane friction continually decreases the angle of axis rotation until it exactly matches the direction of the ball's forward motion, and rev rate (rotational speed) increases until it exactly matches the ball's forward speed: full traction is achieved and the ball enters the roll phase in which forward speed continues to decrease.\nEffect of delivery characteristics on ball motion.\n\"Release ratio\" denotes the ratio of the ball's forward (translational) speed to its rev rate (rotational speed) at time of release. This ratio continually decreases throughout the ball's travel until it reaches exactly 1.0 when full traction is achieved upon entering the roll phase. A too-\"high\" release ratio (a \"speed-dominant\" release) causes the ball to reach the pins while still in the hook phase (resulting in a shallow angle of entry that permits ball deflection and resultant leaves of the 10-pin), and a too-\"low\" release ratio (a \"rev-dominant\" release) causes the ball to enter the roll phase before reaching the pins (sacrificing power to friction that would ideally be delivered to the pins to enhance pin scatter). Ball speed and rev rate are said to be \"matched\" if the ball enters the roll phase immediately before impacting the pins, maximizing power imparted to the pins yet helping to provide an entry angle that minimizes ball deflection.\nVarious characteristics of ball delivery affect a ball's motion throughout its skid, hook and roll phases. The particular way in which energy is imparted to a ball—with varying proportions of that energy divided among ball speed, axis control and rev rate—determines the ball's motion. The following discussion considers delivery characteristics separately, with the understanding that ball motion is determined by a complex interaction of a variety of factors.\nGreater ball speeds give the ball \"less time\" to hook, thus reducing observed hook though imparting more kinetic energy to the pins; conversely, slower speeds allow more time for greater hook though reducing kinetic energy.\nGreater rev rates cause the ball to experience more frictional lane contact per revolution and thus (assuming non-zero axis rotation) greater and earlier hook (less \"length\"— which is the distance from the foul line to the breakpoint at which hooking is maximum); conversely, smaller rev rates cause less frictional engagement and allow the ball to hook less and later (more \"length\").\nAnalysis of the influence of \"axis rotation\" (sometimes called \"side rotation\") is more complex: There is a degree of axis rotation—generally 25° to 35° and varying with ball speed and rev rate—that may be considered optimal in that hook is maximized; however, this optimum axis rotation also causes minimal length. Specifically, Freeman &amp; Hatfield (2018) report optimal axis rotation to be arcsin(ωr/v) where \"ω\" is rev rate (radians/sec), \"r\" is ball radius (m), and \"v\" is ball speed (m/s). Below and above optimal axis rotation, more length and less hook are encountered, with greater-than-optimal axis rotation causing a sharper hook.\nGreater degrees of initial (at-the-foul-line) axis tilt cause the ball to rotate on smaller-circumference \"tracks\" (rings on the ball at which it contacts the lane on each revolution), thus reducing the amount of frictional contact to provide greater length and less hook; conversely, smaller degrees of axis tilt involve larger-circumference tracks with more frictional contact per revolution, thus providing less length and more hook.\nLoft—the distance past the foul line at which the ball first contacts the lane—determines the \"effective\" length of the lane as experienced by the ball: greater loft distances effectively shorten the lane and provide greater length, while smaller loft distances engage the lane earlier and cause an earlier hook.\nEffect of coverstock, core and layout on ball motion.\nVarious characteristics of ball core structure and coverstock composition affect a ball's motion throughout its skid, hook and roll phases. Such motion is largely (about 75%) governed by the lane's frictional interaction with the ball, which exhibits both \"chemical\" friction characteristics and \"physical\" friction characteristics. Also, the ball's internal structure—especially the density, shape (symmetric vs. asymmetric), and orientation of its core (also called \"weight block\") relative to the ball's axis of rotation—substantially affect ball motion.\nA \"dull\" (rough) ball surface, having spikes and pores, provides greater friction in the oil-covered front end of the lane but reduced frictional contact in the dry back end of the lane, and thus enables an earlier hook. In contrast, a \"gloss\" (smooth) ball surface tends to glide atop oil on the front end but establishes \"greater\" frictional contact in the dry back end, thus promoting a sharper hook downlane. Accordingly, because different lane conditions and bowler styles favor different hook profiles, there is no single \"best\" surface.\nA 2005-2008 USBC Ball Motion Study found that the ball design factors that most contributed to ball motion were the microscopic \"spikes\" and pores on the ball's surface (considered part of chemical frictional characteristics), the respective coefficients of friction between ball and lane in the oiled and dry parts of the lane, and the ball's oil absorption rate, followed in dominance by certain characteristics of the ball's core (mainly radius of gyration, and total differential). Freeman and Hatfield (2018) explain that in most circumstances it is chemical friction—controlled by the manufacturer's proprietary coverstock formulation governing its \"stickiness\"—that primarily determines ball motion. Further, surface finish—modifiable by sandpaper, polish and the like—is also a material factor.\nThough manufacturer literature often specifies \"track flare\"—exhibited by successive tracks of oil in a \"bowtie\" pattern and caused by RG differential—the USBC ball motion study showed flare's influence to be small, assuming that a minimal threshold of flare exists to present a \"dry\" surface for successive ball revolutions. Similarly, though manufacturer literature often describes specific core shapes, differently-shaped cores can make exactly the same contribution to ball motion if they have the same overall RG characteristics.\n\"Weak\" layouts (\"pin down\": pin between finger and thumb holes) hook sooner but have milder backend reaction, while \"strong\" layouts (\"pin up\": pin further from thumb hole than finger holes) enable greater skid lengths and more angular backend reaction.\nManufacturers commonly cite specifications relating to a bowling ball's core, include \"radius of gyration\" (RG), \"differential of RG\" (commonly abbreviated \"differential\"), and \"intermediate differential\" (also called \"mass bias\").\nAnalytically, the United States Bowling Congress defines RG as \"the distance from the axis of rotation at which the total mass of a body\nmight be concentrated without changing its moment of inertia\". In practice, a higher RG indicates that a ball's mass is distributed more toward its cover—making it \"cover heavy\"—which tends to make the ball enter the roll phase later (further down the lane). Conversely, a lower RG indicates the ball's mass is distributed more towards its center—making it \"center heavy\"—which tends to make it enter the roll phase sooner.\nDifferential of RG is the difference between maximum and minimum RGs measured with respect to different axes. Differential indicates the ball's track \"flare potential,\" and contributes to how sharply a ball can hook. A higher differential indicates greater track flare potential—more angular motion from the break point to the pocket—and a lower differential indicates lower flare potential and a smoother arc to the hook.\nThe lesser-used \"intermediate differential\" rating (sometimes termed \"mass bias\" rating) quantifies the degree to which a bowling ball core is \"symmetrical\" or \"asymmetrical.\" Analytically, ID is defined by the USBC as the \"difference in radius of gyration between the Y (high RG) and Z (intermediate RG) axes\". In practice, a higher ID indicates greater asymmetry, which causes more area to be created at the break point to cause the ball to respond more quickly to friction than symmetrical balls.\nInformally, a low-differential ball has been likened to one whose core is a spherical object (whose height and width are the same); a high-differential ball has been likened to a tall drinking glass (whose height and width are different); and a high-mass-bias ball has been likened to a tall drinking mug with a handle on the side (which has different widths in different directions).\nHigher-friction surfaces (lower grit numbers) cause balls to hook earlier, and lower-friction surfaces (higher grit numbers) cause balls to skid longer before reacting (hooking).\nReactive cover stocks finishes include \"matte\" (aggressive reaction), \"shiny\" (longer skid distance than matte finish), \"pearl\" (greatest skid distance among reactive cover stocks), and \"hybrid\" (combination of skid distance and back end reaction).\nEffect of lane characteristics on ball motion.\nThe phenomenon of \"lane transition\" occurs when balls remove oil from the lane as they pass, and deposit some of that oil on originally dry parts of the lane. The process of oil removal, commonly called \"breakdown,\" forms dry paths that subsequently cause balls to experience increased friction and to hook sooner. Conversely, the process of oil deposition, commonly called \"carry down,\" occurs when balls form oil tracks in formerly dry areas, tracks that subsequently cause balls to experience less friction and delayed hook. Balls tend to \"roll out\" (hook sooner but hook less) in response to breakdown, and, conversely, tend to skid longer (and hook later) in response to carry down—both resulting in light hits. Breakdown is influenced by the oil absorption characteristics and rev rates of the balls that were previously rolled, and carry down is mitigated by modern balls having substantial track flare.\nLane materials with softer surfaces such as wood engage the ball with more friction and thus provide more hook potential, while harder surfaces like synthetic compositions provide less friction and thus provide less hook potential.\nHigher-viscosity lane oils (those with thicker consistency) engage balls with more friction and thus cause slower speeds and shorter length but provide more hook potential and reduced lane transition; conversely, lane oils of lower viscosity (thinner consistency) are more slippery and thus support greater speeds and length but offer less hook potential and allow faster lane transition. Various factors influence an oil's native viscosity, including temperature (with higher temperatures causing the oil to be thinner) and humidity (variations of which can cause crowning and cupping of the lane surface). Also, high humidity increases friction that reduces skid distance so the ball tends to hook sooner.\nThe lanes' physical topography—hills and valleys that diverge from an ideal planar surface—can substantially and unpredictably affect ball motion, even if the lane is within permissible tolerances.\nManufacturers.\nThe USBC maintains a list, said to be updated weekly, of about 100 bowling ball manufacturers and their approved bowling balls.\nDuckpin balls.\nDuckpin bowling balls are regulated to be from in diameter and to weigh between and . They lack finger holes. Though duckpin balls are slightly larger than candlepin balls, they have less than 60% the diameter of ten-pin balls, to match the smaller size of duckpins. Duckpin balls are sometimes used for scaled-down ten-pin bowling lanes installed in arcades and other amusement facilities.\nFive-pin balls.\nThe basic specifications of five-pin balls are the same a duckpin balls: diameters from , weights from to ; the balls have no finger holes.\nCandlepin balls.\nCandlepin bowling balls have a weight of between and , and a diameter of —much smaller than the balls in ten-pin bowling, and even smaller than the balls in duckpin bowling . Candlepin balls deflect significantly upon impact, being even lighter than the candlepins themselves.\nNine-pin balls.\nAmerican nine-pin bowling uses the same ball (and pins) as in ten-pin bowling. European nine-pin bowling balls (such as those used in German kegel) are smaller, sized between ten-pin and duckpin balls, and have no holes. The ball is in diameter and weighs approximately . There are also special balls for novice players, which is in diameter and weigh , often with two finger holes."

        "title": "Australian Open (golf)",
        "text": "The Australian Open, owned and run by Golf Australia, is the oldest and most prestigious golf tournament on the PGA Tour of Australasia. The Open was first played in 1904 and takes place toward the end of each year.\nThe winner of the tournament receives the \"Stonehaven Cup\", presented by Lord Stonehaven, the Governor-General of Australia from 1925 to 1930. It was first presented in 1930.\nStatus.\nThe Australian Open was the flagship tournament of the PGA Tour of Australasia from 1992 to 2019. It had a special status in the Official World Golf Ranking's points system, awarding a minimum 32 points to the winner regardless of the strength of the field.\nThe tournament was part of the OneAsia Tour from 2009 to 2016. The 2022 edition was co-sanctioned by the European Tour.\nSince the Open Qualifying Series was introduced for the 2014 Open Championship, the Australian Open has been the first of a number of qualifying tournaments, giving up to three non-exempt players entry into the Open Championship.\nThe Australian Open was once referred to as the \"fifth major\" by Jack Nicklaus and Rory McIlroy.\nHistory.\nThe Australian Golf Union was formed in 1898 and from 1899 organised a championship meeting. From 1899 to 1902 this included the Australian Amateur championship contested over 72 holes of stroke play. In 1903 the format was revised, there being a 36-hole stroke-play stage after which the leading 8 played match-play with a 36-hole final. The 1904 championship meeting was held at The Australian Golf Club. In 1903, the club had hosted the New South Wales Amateur and had run the 36-hole stroke-play qualifying stage as an open event, with professionals as well as amateurs competing. The idea was used at the 1904 championship meeting. There was a 72-hole stroke-play event open to professionals, played over two days, after which the leading 16 amateurs competed for the amateur championship. The stroke-play event became the first Australian Open and was won by an English amateur, Michael Scott, with a score of 315. Two more amateurs Leslie Penfold Hyland and Dan Soutar finished second and third, while Carnegie Clark was the leading professional, tied for fourth place.\nThe 1905 championship meeting was played at Royal Melbourne and the open and amateur championship were decided by the same 72-hole tournament. Dan Soutar, now a professional, won the open with Michael Scott second, 10 strokes behind. As the leading amateur, Scott won the amateur championship. The 1906 open was won by Carnegie Clark, 5 ahead of Soutar. Soutar was to be runner-up in five successive opens, from 1906 to 1910. In 1907 Scott repeated his success of 1904, and further amateur wins came in the following two years, Clyde Pearce winning in 1908 and Claude Felstead in 1909. The 1910 open was held in South Australia for the first time and resulted in a second win for Clark, with a record score of 306, 11 strokes ahead of Soutar. Clark won for the third time the following year, although only by a single shot from Fred Popplewell. The 1912 open was won by an 18-year-old amateur, Ivo Whitton, 5 ahead of Popplewell and Soutar. Whitton won again the following year with a new record score of 302. Another amateur Audley Lemprière came second with Soutar third, a distant 15 strokes behind Whitton.\nThe open restarted in 1920 and was won by Joe Kirkwood Sr. with a score of 290, 12 strokes better than the previous record score. Dan Soutar was second, 5 shots behind, the seventh time he had been runner-up. Five of the nine opens between 1924 and 1932 were won by amateurs. In 1924 Alex Russell led from the start after an opening round of 68 and, with further rounds of 79, 78 and 78, won by two strokes from Carnegie Clark. Ivo Whitton won in 1926, 13 years after his last win, and won again in 1929 and 1931. Mick Ryan won in 1932, the third successive amateur winner at Royal Adelaide. Of the professionals, Fred Popplewell won twice, in 1925 and 1928, while Rufus Stewart won in 1927 and was runner-up in the other four opens between 1926 and 1930. 1928 was the first Open played over 3 days, with 36 holes on the final day. There was a cut after 36 holes with the leading 60 and ties playing on the final day. With the leading 16 amateurs in the Open qualifying for the match play stage of the amateur championship, there was also a proviso that at least 24 amateurs should make the cut. The 1930 open was the first to be held at the Metropolitan Golf Club and the winner, Frank Eyre, was the first to be presented with the Stonehaven Cup.\n1931 saw the emergence of 16-year-old Jim Ferrier. Needing 5 at the last hole to tie Ivo Whitton, he took 6 and finished runner-up. He was also a runner-up in 1933 and 1935. He had another good change to win in 1935 but took 7 at the 71st hole and again finished a stroke behind the winner. He didn't win the open until 1938, when he won by a record 14 strokes from Norman Von Nida. He repeated his success in 1939. 1934 saw the first serious American challenger when Gene Sarazen played in the event. He was on a world tour with Joe Kirkwood Jr. However Billy Bolger won the open with a new record score of 283, with Sarazen second and Kirkwood fourth. Sarazen returned in 1936 and won with a score of 282, a new record.\nThe championship resumed in 1946 at Royal Sydney and was won by Ossie Pickworth, who finished two ahead of the amateur Alan Waterson. The Australian Amateur was also played at Royal Sydney, starting the following week. However, the Open no longer acted as a qualifying event for the amateur championship, which became match-play only. 1947 was the first year that the open and amateur were played at different venues, Royal Queensland hosting the open for the first time. It was also the first time it had been played as early as June. Billy McWilliam scored 65 in the first round and took an 8 stroke lead. He still led by 4 at the start of the final round but took 78, while Pickworth scored 69 to retain his title by 5 shots. From 1947 it was generally the case that the Open and the Amateur were played at separate venues. This naturally tended to reduce the number of amateurs playing in the open, since they no longer had to play it to qualify for the amateur championship. 1948 saw the first appearance of Jim Ferrier since 1939, creating much public interest in the event. Pickworth and Ferrier tied on 289, resulting in the first open playoff. Pickworth won the 18 hole playoff with a score of 71 to Ferrier's 74, to win his third successive title. Pickworth seemed likely to win his fourth title in 1949 as he led by 6 strokes after 3 rounds. However, Eric Cremin had a last round of 68 to Pickworth's 80 to win the title. Pickworth was later disqualified for recording an incorrect score at his final hole, so that Norman Von Nida, playing in his first open since 1939, became the runner-up.\nNorman Von Nida was the leading player of the early-1950s, winning the open in 1950, 1952 and 1953 and being a runner-up in the other four opens between 1949 and 1955. Peter Thomson won in 1951 while Ossie Pickworth took his fourth title in 1954. 1952 was the first open held in Western Australia, being played at Lake Karrinyup. Von Nida won with a record score of 278. Von Nida equalled that record in 1953 and also equalled the record for the lowest round, with his final 65. Bobby Locke won in 1955, the first overseas winner since 1936. This was played at Gailes, near Brisbane, in late May, the earliest of any open. Kel Nagle seems a likely winner in 1956 but finished badly, for a final round 76, while Bruce Crampton finished with two birdies for a 68 and won by two strokes.\nGary Player made his first appearance in 1957, and would eventually win the title 7 times. He seemed a likely winner on his debut, but in the final round took 7 at the 13th and 6 at the 16th and lost by a stroke from Frank Phillips. Player returned in 1958, winning by 5 strokes. Kel Nagle had been close to winning a number of times and won his only open in 1959. The 1960 open was held at Lake Karrinyup for the second time, a week after the amateur championship. Bruce Devlin, still an amateur, won his only open. Amateurs took 8 of the first 9 places. Player returned in 1961 but only finished tied for third, Phillips winning by two strokes from Nagle. Player won in 1962, by two strokes from Nagle. Jack Nicklaus made his debut in 1962, finishing 5th. Player won again in 1963, his third win, by 5 shots from Bruce Devlin. Devlin came close to winning in 1964. Needing a par-5 at the 72nd hole he took 6, and then lost to Jack Nicklaus by 3 strokes in an 18-hole playoff. The playoff was played on a Sunday, the first Sunday play in the open's history. Player won his fourth title in 1965, setting a new record score of 264, despite taking a bogey-5 at the final hole. Player started with a record round of 62 and had another 62 in the third round. Nicklaus and Phillips tied for second place, 6 behind Player.\nThe 1966 open was the first to be held over four days and the first to finish on a Sunday. Arnold Palmer made his debut in the event and won by 5 strokes from Kel Nagle. Peter Thomson won his second open in 1967, the first Australian winner since 1961. He won by 7 strokes from Col Johnston. Jack Nicklaus won for the second time in 1968, beating Gary Player by a stroke after making a birdie-3 at the final hole. The 1968 open was sponsored by a local TV company, the first open to be sponsored. From 1969 the event was sponsored by Qantas. In difficult conditions, Player had a final round 77, but still won his 5th title in 1969, equalling Ivo Whitton's record. In 1970 Player led by 8 strokes after three rounds and, despite a last round 74, won by 3, for his 6th win in the event. In 1971 the open was held in Tasmania for the only time, at Royal Hobart. Nicklaus had a 9-stroke lead after three rounds and won by 8 shots. In 1972 there was an 18-hole playoff after a tie between Peter Thomson and David Graham. Graham drove out-of-bounds at the first hole and Thomson took a three-stroke lead after making a birdie. Thomson eventually won by 6 strokes for his third title. J. C. Snead won in 1973, by two strokes from Jerry Breaux, a little-known American. In 1974 Player won his 7th title. Leading by 5 strokes at the start of the final round, he scored 73 and won by 3.\nFrom 1975 to 1978 the open was held at The Australian Golf Club. Kerry Packer had funded a redesign of the course by Jack Nicklaus. The event was broadcast through Packer's Channel Nine network. He also financed a large increase in the prize money. Nicklaus won three of the four events, in 1973, 1974 and 1976 while David Graham won in 1975. The 1979 and 1980 events were sponsored by Dunhill but with less prize money than in 1978. Jack Newton won in 1979 with Greg Norman winning in 1980. The 1981 event was multi-sponsored, without a title sponsor, and was won by Bill Rogers, beating Norman by a stroke.\nHaving not been played in 2020 or 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event returned in 2022. It was announced that the 2022 tournament would feature the men's and women's Opens played on the same course at the same time. They would also share a prize fund of US$3,400,000. In addition to this announcement, it was also confirmed that the European Tour would sanction the men's event for the first time.\nWinners.\nSources:"

        "text": "Jeffrey Dwayne Daniels (born June 24, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and current assistant coach to the Carolina Hurricanes. He was the former head coach and general manager of the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League. In 2010–11, Daniels led the Charlotte Checkers to 44 wins and 94 points during the regular-season, the best totals for a Carolina affiliate since 2004–05. Daniels then guided the Checkers to the Eastern Conference Final, the deepest Calder Cup playoff run for Carolina’s AHL team since the 1996–97 Springfield Falcons.\nPrior to being appointed to his current post, Daniels spent four seasons with the Hurricanes as an assistant coach. He helped guide the Hurricanes to the 2006 Stanley Cup championship, marking the second time he captured the Stanley Cup in his hockey career, as he also has his name inscribed on the Cup as a player with the 1992 Pittsburgh Penguins.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, he played in the 1981 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Oshawa. He later played junior ice hockey with his hometown Oshawa Generals.\nDaniels was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the sixth round, 109th overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He has two Stanley Cup rings with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991, and 1992. Daniels' name was engraved on the Cup in 1992, even though he only played two games, and did not qualify to be on the Stanley Cup. In his 15-year professional playing career as a forward, Daniels spent time with the Pittsburgh, Florida, Nashville and Carolina organizations. He played in 425 NHL regular-season games, scoring 17 goals and 26 assists (43 points), and 41 Stanley Cup Playoff games, where he totalled three goals and five assists (8 points). He played in the Hurricanes organization for six seasons, tallying eight goals and 12 assists (20 points) in 272 regular season games, and three assists in 29 playoff games, while making a trip to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2002.\nCoaching career.\nDaniels retired as a player on November 17, 2003. On June 9, 2008, Daniels was named the head coach and general manager for the Albany River Rats.

        "title": "1989–90 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1989 season began on December 31, 1989. The postseason tournament concluded with the San Francisco 49ers defeating the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV, 55–10, on January 28, 1990, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nThis was the last season in which the NFL used a 10-team playoff format. The league would expand the playoffs to 12 teams next season. This is also the last time in which two teams from the same division could not face each other in the Divisional Round.\nThis season featured only three teams that failed to make the previous season's postseason. The New York Giants, who were eliminated on the final day of the 1988 season, rebounded to win a division title, while the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers recovered from disappointing seasons.\nSchedule.\nThe starting times for the Conference Championship Games were changed from the then-customary 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST. This was to accommodate the fact that the Denver Broncos and San Francisco 49ers hosted the AFC and NFC Championship Games in the Mountain Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone, respectively—thus avoiding a locally played game at 9:30 a.m. PST or 10:30 a.m. MST.\nThis was the last season that the Super Bowl started at a time prior to 6:00 p.m. EST, with the local time zone going into consideration.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, while CBS televised the NFC games and Super Bowl XXIV.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSunday, December 31, 1989.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 21, Philadelphia Eagles 7.\nThe Rams outgained the Eagles in total yards 409 to 306 and jumped to a 14-0 first half lead of the way to their first playoff win in four years.\nLA scored on the opening drive, moving the ball 83 yards in five plays. Jim Everett finished the drive with a long pass to receiver Henry Ellard, who outjumped Izel Jenkins for the ball and raced 39 yards to the end zone. The next time the Rams had the ball, Everett's 30-yard completion to Ellard set up his 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Damone Johnson, giving the team a 14–0 lead less than eight minutes into the game. By the end of the first quarter, Everett had completed 7/11 passes for 173 yards, and at the end of the first half, the Eagles had a mere 77 total yards and three first downs. However, the Rams would blow several scoring chances that enabled the Eagles to stay in the game: Greg Bell lost a fumble on the Philadelphia 4-yard line, Everett threw an interception to Jenkins from the Eagles 25, and kicker Mike Lansford missed a 47-yard field goal.\nPhiladelphia's offense made a major improvement in the second half (229 yards and 11 first downs), but they would not score until 10:38 remained in the fourth quarter when fullback Anthony Toney capped an 80-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 14–7. Eagles linebacker Seth Joyner then picked off a pass from Everett on the Philadelphia 30-yard line, giving the team a great chance to drive for the tying score. But they ended up punting at the end of an ugly series in which Heath Sherman fumbled after an 11-yard run (recovered by receiver Cris Carter), Randall Cunningham fumbled a snap (he recovered it), and then threw two incompletions. Los Angeles subsequently put the game away with an 84-yard, 7-play scoring drive. Everett kept it going on third and 5 with a 15-yard completion to running back Buford McGee, and then Bell took off for a 54-yard burst two plays later, moving the ball to the Eagles 10-yard line. Eventually, he finished the drive with a 7-yard touchdown run, making the final score 21–7.\n\"This year we wanted nothing short of the Super Bowl\", said Eagles defensive tackle Mike Golic. \"To lose the first game, a lot of people are going to be seriously bummed out for a long time. I'm disgusted.\"\nEverett completed 18 of 33 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions. Ellard caught four passes for 87 yards and a score. Bell rushed for 124 yards and a touchdown, while also catching a 23-yard pass. Linebacker Kevin Greene had five tackles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery. Cunningham completed 24 of 40 passes for 238 yards with an interception, and rushed for 39 yards. Fullback Keith Byars was the Eagles top receiver with nine receptions for 68 yards.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Rams and Eagles. Philadelphia won the only previous meeting.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 26, Houston Oilers 23 (OT).\nPittsburgh cornerback Rod Woodson recovered a fumble to set up Gary Anderson's winning 50-yard field goal in overtime to give Pittsburgh the win.\nHouston took the opening kickoff and drove to the Steelers 40-yard line, but were stopped there and Tony Zendejas missed a 55-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Steelers rookie Jerry Olsavsky blocked a punt from Greg Montgomery and Pittsburgh recovered on the Oilers 23. Eventually facing fourth and 1 on the Houston 9-yard line, Steelers coach Chuck Noll decided to go for the first down. This paid off as running back Tim Worley took a pitch and ran all the way to the end zone, evading linebacker Robert Lyles and plowing right through safety Bubba McDowell on the way to a 7–0 Steelers lead with 2:36 left in the first quarter.\nHouston responded on their next drive, moving the ball 96 yards to the Steelers 3-yard line, but could go no further and settled for a 26-yard Zendejas field goal. Then McDowell recovered a fumble from Worley on the Pittsburgh 41. From there the Oilers advanced to the 17-yard line, but when faced with fourth and 1 they decided to settle for another Zendejas field goal, cutting the score to 7–6. Pittsburgh struck back with a drive to the Oilers 9, featured a 49-yard run by Merril Hoge. However, they also ended up facing fourth and 1, and would settle for an Anderson field goal to put them up 10–6 going into halftime.\nThe field goal battle continued in the third quarter, with Zendejas kicking one more and Anderson adding another two, making the score 16–9 at the start of the fourth quarter. But quarterback Warren Moon finally got his team to the end zone with a 10-play, 80-yard drive to score on his 18-yard touchdown pass to Ernest Givins that tied the game. Following a Pittsburgh three-and-out, Harry Newsome's punt went just 25 yards to the Steelers 38-yard line. From there it took just five plays for Houston to take their first lead of the game, scoring on Moon's 9-yard pass touchdown pass to Givins that put them up 23–16 with 5:16 left in regulation. Starting from their own 18 after the kickoff, Pittsburgh drove 82 yards, featuring a 22-yard run by receiver Dwight Stone (the only time he touched the ball all game) on a reverse play, to score on Hoge's 2-yard touchdown run with 46 seconds left, tying the game and sending it into overtime.\nPittsburgh won the coin toss and received the ball first, but were quickly forced to punt, and another short kick from Newsome gave Houston the ball with great field position on the Steelers 45-yard line. On the Oilers first play, Moon handed the ball off to Lorenzo White, who was quickly leveled by Woodson and defensive end Tim Johnson, causing a fumble that Woodson recovered and returned four yards to the Oilers 46. From there, Pittsburgh could gain just 13 yards with a few Hoge carries before facing a fourth down. But it was enough for Anderson to kick a 50-yard field goal, his longest attempt of the season, which he sent perfectly through the uprights to give the Steelers the win.\nHoge finished the game with 100 rushing yards on just 17 carries, along with three receptions for 26 yards. Moon threw for 315 yards and two touchdowns. Givins caught 11 passes for 136 yards. Pittsburgh won despite being outgained in total yards 380–289. Oilers coach Jerry Glanville was fired a few days after this game. This was a particularly satisfying win for the Steelers, who had started the season with a 51–0 loss to Cleveland and a 41–10 loss to Cincinnati. They had been shutout three times, outgained by their opponents in ten consecutive games, and had to recover from a 4–6 record to get into the playoffs by winning five of their last six games.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Steelers and Oilers. Pittsburgh won both previous meetings.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 6, 1990.\nAFC: Cleveland Browns 34, Buffalo Bills 30.\nIn a shootout, 33-year-old Browns linebacker Clay Matthews intercepted Bills quarterback Jim Kelly at the Cleveland 1-yard line with three seconds left to preserve a 34–30 victory. Kelly threw for 405 yards and four touchdowns while Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar threw for 251 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. Browns receiver Webster Slaughter had the best postseason performance of his career with three receptions for 114 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe game was played on a cold icy field that would have a big impact on the game. The Browns took their first drive into Bills territory, but came up empty when Matt Bahr slipped while planting his foot on a 45-yard field goal attempt. On Buffalo's second play after the missed kick, Kelly threw a short pass to Andre Reed. Felix Wright slipped while going into coverage, leaving Reed wide open and he ended up taking the ball 72 yards to the end zone. But Cleveland struck back with an 18-yard completion from Kosar to Slaughter on the first play after the kickoff, which led to a 45-yard field goal by Bahr. Then after a punt, the Browns drove 79 yards and scored on a 52-yard touchdown pass from Kosar to Slaughter in the second quarter. Buffalo receiver Don Beebe returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the 34-yard line. On the next play, Kelly completed a 21-yard pass to James Lofton. The Bills were on the move and did not stop until Kelly finished the drive with a 33-yard touchdown pass to Lofton that put the Bills back in the lead, 14–10. With less than 5 minutes left in the second quarter, the Browns took advantage of a short 34-yard punt by John Kidd that gave them the ball on their own 49-yard line. Fullback Kevin Mack carried the ball 4 times for 31 yards as the team drove to retake the lead with Ron Middleton's 3-yard touchdown catch shortly before the end of the first half. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Browns 40-yard line. But on a 4th and 1 conversion attempt, Cleveland defensive end Carl Hairston sacked Kelly to force a turnover on downs.\nOn the second drive of the second half, the first turnover of the game occurred when Mark Harper intercepted a pass from Kelly on the Cleveland 46. Kosar then hooked up with Slaughter for another touchdown pass, this one 44-yards, to increase their lead to 24–14. The Bills gave the ball up again on their next drive when Larry Kinnebrew lost a fumble that was recovered on the Browns 25-yard line by defensive back Felix Wright. But on the next play, they took it back as Fred Smerlas forced a fumble from Mack that was recovered by Bills safety Mark Kelso on the 26. A few plays later on 3rd and 8, Kelly completed a 15-yard pass to running back Thurman Thomas on the Browns 4-yard line, setting up his 6-yard touchdown pass to Thomas to make the score 24–21. But Browns running back Eric Metcalf returned the ensuing kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown to give his team a 31–21 lead by the end of the third quarter.\nBuffalo responded by driving 67 yards, including a 27-yard completion from Kelly to Thomas, to score on Scott Norwood's 30-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 31–24. Cleveland struck back with a 51-yard drive to score a field goal of their own, a 46-yard kick by Bahr, retaking their two-score lead at 34–24 with 6:57 left in the game. Buffalo then drove 77 yards entirely on receptions by Thomas and fellow running back Ronnie Harmon, who hauled in a 22-yard catch on the Browns 3-yard line. On the next play, Kelly's 3-yard touchdown pass to Thomas cut their deficit to 34–30 with 3:56 left in regulation. But Scott Norwood slipped on an icy patch of the field while attempting the extra point, forcing the Bills to attempt to score a touchdown instead of a field goal on their final drive. After Buffalo's defense forced the Browns to go three-and-out, Kelly led the Bills to Cleveland's 11-yard line, converting two fourth downs on the way there. But Harmon dropped a potential game winning catch in the end zone and Kelly was intercepted by Matthews on the next play.\nMetcalf finished with 169 all purpose yards. Thomas set a playoff record with 13 receptions for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also rushing for 27 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Bills and Browns.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 41, Minnesota Vikings 13.\n49ers quarterback Joe Montana threw for 241 yards and four touchdowns as San Francisco dominated the Vikings, gaining 403 total yards against a Minnesota defense that was ranked #1 in the league during all 16 weeks of the season and forcing five turnovers. Minnesota had led the NFL in sacks during the regular season with 72, but in this game Montana was not sacked at all.\nMinnesota scored first on a 7.5 minute, 70-yard drive that ended with a 38-yard field goal by Rich Karlis, but then Montana completed four unanswered scores: a 72-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice, an 8-yarder to tight end Brent Jones, an 8-yarder to wide receiver John Taylor, and a 13-yarder to Rice. In the fourth quarter, Ronnie Lott returned an interception 58 yards for a touchdown, and Tim McKyer's 41-yard interception return set up their final score on Roger Craig's 4-yard run. The 49ers could have had an even bigger lead, but Mike Cofer missed two fields goals from distances of 31 and 32 yards, along with an extra point, while Craig lost an early fumble on the Minnesota 9-yard line.\nThe Vikings defense had not allowed a 100-yard rusher all season, but Craig reached triple digits on his first carry of the second half, and finished the game with 125 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Rice caught six passes for 114 yards and two touchdowns. One of the few bright spots of the game for Minnesota was tight end Steve Jordan, who caught nine passes for 149 yards.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Vikings and 49ers. San Francisco won two of the previous three meetings.\nSunday, January 7, 1990.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 19, New York Giants 13 (OT).\nThe Rams upset the Giants with quarterback Jim Everett's 30-yard touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson with 1:06 gone in overtime.\nThe Giants opened the game by moving into Rams' territory after one play. Their drive stalled inside the 20 and New York settled for a 35-yard field goal by Raúl Allegre. On the Rams' first drive of the game, Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor forced a fumble while sacking Everett that Gary Reasons recovered for New York on the Giants 11-yard line. Allegre later kicked a second first quarter field goal to make the score 6–0, but in the second quarter, Giants quarterback Phil Simms threw a pass that was deflected by Jerry Gray and intercepted by safety Michael Stewart, who returned it 29 yards to the New York 20-yard line. On the next play, Everett threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Anderson with just 17 seconds left in the half, giving the Rams a 7–6 halftime lead.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Everett was intercepted in the end zone by Mark Collins. Later on, New York put together an 82-yard, 14-play drive to take the lead. Simms completed passes to Dave Meggett for 11 yards and Zeke Mowatt for 23, while running back Ottis Anderson rushed six times for 28 yards, including a 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 13–7 with two minutes remaining in the quarter. But LA stormed right back, with Everett completing two passes to Henry Ellard for gains of 23 and 16 yards, along with a 16-yard run by Greg Bell, on the way to a 31-yard field goal by Mike Lansford. Later in the quarter, Everett completed six of seven passes for 44 yards and rushed for 12 yards on a 75-yard drive that ended with Lansford's 21-yard field goal with 3:01 left, tying the score and sending the game into overtime.\nAfter winning the coin toss, Los Angeles needed just one drive and 1:06 to win the game. Starting from their own 23-yard line, Everett's completions to tight end Pete Holohan and Ellard for gains of 12 and 13 yards moved the ball to the 48. On the next play, Sheldon White was called for a 27-yard pass interference penalty while trying to cover Anderson. Following a 5-yard false start penalty against the Rams, Everett connected with Anderson for a 30-yard touchdown completion.\nEllard had the best postseason performance of his career with eight receptions for 125 yards. Taylor had two sacks, while Anderson finished with 120 rushing yards. It proved to be the final playoff win for the Rams franchise before relocating to St. Louis in 1995, their last as a franchise until 1999, and their last playoff win as the LA Rams until the 2018 season.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Rams and Giants. New York won the only prior meeting.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 24, Pittsburgh Steelers 23.\nThe Broncos recovered from two early 10-point deficits to eventually win on a 71-yard drive that was capped by Mel Bratton's 1-yard touchdown run with 2:27 left in the game. For the second game in a row, Steelers running back Merril Hoge had a superb performance, rushing for 120 yards on 16 carries and catching eight passes for 60 yards. But this time it wasn't enough to lift his team to victory. Broncos receiver Mark Jackson caught five passes for 111 yards.\nThe Steelers jumped to an early 3–0 lead with a 32-yard field goal by Gary Anderson. On the first play of the second quarter, Hoge ripped off a 45-yard run, the longest of his career. He ended up rushing for 60 yards on the Steelers drive, including a 7-yard touchdown carry to increase the Steelers lead to 10–0. Denver responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive to score on Bratton's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the lead to 10–7. But the Steelers stormed right back, with Bubby Brister completing a 25-yard pass to tight end Mike Mularkey and rookie running back Tim Worley contributing a 19-yard carry on the way to a 9-yard scoring reception by Louis Lipps. Shortly before the end of the half, Broncos kicker David Treadwell made a 43-yard field goal, putting the score at 17-10 going into halftime.\nIn the third quarter, Broncos defenders Karl Mecklenburg and Greg Kragen forced a fumble from Worley that Tyrone Braxton recovered on the Steelers 37-yard line, setting up quarterback John Elway's 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vance Johnson to tie the game at 17. Brister struck back, completing a 19-yard screen to Hoge and a 30-yard pass to rookie receiver Mark Stock on the way to a 35-yard Anderson field goal. Then in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh defensive back Thomas Everett intercepted an Elway pass and returned it 26 yards to midfield, setting up Anderson's 32-yard field goal to make the score 23–17. The Steelers appeared to have a big chance to put the game away following a Denver punt. But after a productive start to their drive, Braxton tackled Hodge 1-yard short of a first down at the Denver 41 to bring up fourth down and force a punt.\nNow with seven minutes left in the game, Elway led the Broncos 71 yards in nine plays, including a 36-yard completion to Jackson and a 15-yarder to Ricky Nattiel. Bratton finished the drive with his second 1-yard touchdown of the game, this one with 2:27 left. This time, the Steelers had no ability to respond. On first down of their ensuring possession, Brister fired a pass to a wide open Stock, but he tried to turn upfield before securing the catch and it fell to the turf incomplete. Then after another incompletion, Brister fumbled a low snap from backup center Chuck Lanza (filling in for injured All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson) in shotgun formation, and Broncos safety Randy Robbins recovered the ball to secure the win.\nBrister completed 19/29 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown. Elway threw for 239 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, and rushed for 44 yards.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Steelers and Broncos. Pittsburgh won two of the previous three meetings.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 14, 1990.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 37, Cleveland Browns 21.\nQuarterback John Elway led the Broncos to a 37–21 victory with 385 passing yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also leading the Broncos in rushing with 39 yards on the ground. Denver outgained Cleveland in total yards 497 to 256 and forced three turnovers.\nDenver scored first with David Treadwell's 29-yard field goal, five plays after Broncos safety Dennis Smith intercepted a pass from Bernie Kosar on the Cleveland 35 with just over two minutes left in the first quarter. Then on their next drive, Frank Minnifield stumbled while trying to bump receiver Mike Young at the line of scrimmage, enabling Young to soar past him, catch a pass from Elway, and take off for a 70-yard touchdown reception that put Denver up 10–0 at the end of the half.\nCleveland struck back on their opening drive of the third quarter with a 79-yard, 8-play touchdown drive. Kosar had a 16-yard scramble on the possession, and eventually wrapped it up with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Brian Brennan, cutting the score to 10–7. However, Denver responded with a touchdown of their own, as Sammy Winder (filling in for injured starter Bobby Humphrey) rushed for 22 yards on the drive, while Elway completed a 53-yard pass to Young and finished it off with a 5-yard scoring pass to tight end Orson Mobley, putting the team back up by 10 points at 17–7. Later in the quarter, Cleveland defensive back Kyle Kramer was called for a 15-yard spearing penalty on Elway's 25-yard run, setting up Winder's 7-yard touchdown run that gave the Broncos a 24–7 lead with 4:19 left in the third quarter.\nNow down by 17 points, Kosar desperately rallied the Browns back, completing passes to Reggie Langhorne, Lawyer Tillman, and Webster Slaughter for gains of 27, 15, and 16 yards. Then he connected with Brennan for a 10-yard touchdown completion that made the score 24–14. A few plays after the ensuing kickoff, defensive end Al Baker forced a fumble from Broncos running back Mel Bratton. Felix Wright recovered the ball and returned it 27 yards to the Denver 1-yard line, setting up Tim Manoa's 2-yard touchdown run and downing their deficit to 24-21 going into the fourth quarter.\nHowever, Denver quickly eliminated Cleveland's comeback hopes with their opening drive of the fourth quarter. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Elway completed a 23-yard pass to Vance Johnson. Then on third and 10 from the Denver 43, he completed a 20-yard pass to Johnson, two plays before hooking up with Winder for a 39-yard touchdown completion. Denver then scored field goals on each of their next two drives to put the game away.\nYoung finished the game with 123 yards and a touchdown on just two receptions. Johnson had seven catches for 93 yards. This was the third time in the last four years Denver defeated Cleveland in the AFC Championship Game. To date, this is Cleveland's most recent appearance in an AFC Championship game.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Browns and Broncos. Denver won both prior meetings.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3.\nThe Rams had split their two games with San Francisco during the season, and only a dramatic comeback by San Francisco on a Monday night game had prevented LA from sweeping the series. But in this game, the 49ers crushed the Rams with 442 total yards and held the ball for 39:48. LA finished the game with just 156 yards, with only 26 on the ground, and quarterback Jim Everett, who threw for 4,310 yards and 29 touchdowns during the season, completed only 16 of 36 passes for 141 yards and was intercepted three times. His dual threat receiving tandem of Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard was nullified as they combined for just three receptions for 32 yards. Everett was reportedly \"shellshocked\" from the numerous times he was sacked and hit, reaching a low point in the game on a play in which he fell down in the pocket in anticipation of a sack before any San Francisco defenders reached him (infamously known as Everett's \"Phantom Sack\"). This would haunt him for the rest of his career, and eventually bring him into an infamous televised confrontation with Jim Rome.\nLos Angeles took advantage of a 31-yard punt by Barry Helton that gave them a first down at midfield, driving to the 6 in 10 plays and scoring on Mike Lansford's 23-yard field goal. However, this would be their only score, and Helton would punt only once more during the game. They soon got another chance to score when 49ers tight end Brent Jones lost a fumble. Guard Guy McIntyre picked up the ball, but then fumbled it as well, and the ball was recovered by linebacker Larry Kelm. While the Rams had momentum at this point, it shifted to San Francisco's favor for good when safety Ronnie Lott batted down a pass intended for a wide open Anderson. Had Anderson made the catch, he would have scored easily, giving the Rams a 10–0 lead. Instead, the Rams ended up punting, and San Francisco stormed down the field on a 13-play, 89-yard scoring drive. Montana completed 5/6 passes for 67 yards on the possession, the last one a 20-yard touchdown completion to Jones 3:33 into the second quarter.\nOn LA's ensuing drive, Everett threw a pass that bounced off Ellard and Don Griffin before being intercepted by Tim McKyer, who returned the ball 27 yards to the Rams 27-yard line. Five plays later, Roger Craig increased the 49ers lead to 14–3 with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then after a Rams punt, Montana completed eight of 10 passes for 90 yards on a 14-play, 87-yard drive (which involved overcoming a 15-yard personal foul call against center Jesse Sapolu) to score on an 18-yard touchdown completion to John Taylor with nine seconds left in the half.\nAn 11-play, 62-yard drive that ended with a 28-yard Mike Cofer field goal increased the 49ers lead to 24-3 early in the third quarter. Cofer later missed a field goal after Lott picked off an Everett pass, but made a 36-yarder on the first play of the fourth quarter, and a 25-yard kick with 5:40 left in the game to make the final score 30–3.\nMontana showed much precision and finished the game completing 26 of 30 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns. Fullback Tom Rathman rushed for 63 yards and caught six passes for 48 yards. Craig was the top rusher of the game with 94 yards and a touchdown, while also catching three passes for 40 yards.\nThe Rams did not qualify for the playoffs again in their original tenure in Los Angeles. After moving to St. Louis in 1995, it would take until 1999 for the Rams to return to the playoffs. After making the playoffs several times in St. Louis, most recently in 2004, the Rams again underwent a long playoff drought that extended into their first season back in Los Angeles in 2015.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Rams and 49ers as well as the first NFL playoff matchup between two California-based teams.\nSuper Bowl XXIV: San Francisco 49ers 55, Denver Broncos 10.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the 49ers and Broncos."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1988 season began on December 24, 1988. The postseason tournament concluded with the San Francisco 49ers defeating the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII, 20–16, on January 22, 1989, at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Florida.\nSchedule.\nDue to Christmas falling on a Sunday, the two wild card playoff games were held in a span of three days.\nIn the United States, CBS televised the NFC playoff games, while NBC broadcast the AFC games and Super Bowl XXIII.\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 24, 1988.\nAFC: Houston Oilers 24, Cleveland Browns 23.\nIn a brutal game in which both teams combined for 22 penalties (13 for Houston, nine for Cleveland), including four personal fouls, Oilers cornerback Richard Johnson's interception set up kicker Tony Zendejas' game-clinching 49-yard field goal to give the Oilers a two-score lead with 1:54 left in the game. Houston won despite throwing three interceptions and losing their leading rusher Mike Rozier to injury after his first play of the game.\nOn the second play of the game, Felix Wright intercepted a pass from Warren Moon and returned it 13 yards to the Oilers 33-yard line to set up a 33-yard field goal by Matt Bahr. Houston responded with a 91-yard drive that consumed 9:44 and ended on Moon's 14-yard touchdown pass to running back Allen Pinkett. Then on the first play of Cleveland's next drive, Browns quarterback Don Strock, who was filling in for the injured Bernie Kosar and starting in a playoff game for the first time in his 16-season career, fumbled a snap and Oilers nose tackle Richard Byrd recovered the ball. Strock sprained his wrist while going after the ball on the play, and was replaced by third-string quarterback Mike Pagel. Meanwhile, Houston scored on their first play after the turnover with Pinkett's 16-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–3. They had a chance to score again near the end of the half, but Wright picked off Moon's pass in the end zone.\nPagel, now leading the Browns offense in what turned out to be the only playoff game he would play in his 11-season career, led the Browns back 71 yards on a drive that had four consecutive plays end with penalties (including a brawl between the teams) to score on Bahr's second field goal of the day. Bahr added one more field goal before the end of the half to cut the score to 14–9 at halftime.\nIn the third quarter, a controversial blown call occurred when Houston QB Warren Moon attempted a backward pass at his own 7 yard line. The pass ricocheted off the intended receiver and fell incomplete. Cleveland linebacker Clay Matthews recovered the assumed lateral at the Oilers' 5 yard line and went into the end zone for an apparent touchdown. Instant replay clearly showed that Moon's pass had traveled backwards and the Browns should have been either awarded a touchdown with Matthews' recovery and advance into the end zone, or given possession of the ball at the Oilers' 5 yard line. However, Houston was inexplicably granted possession of the ball at the 5 yard line, due to an inadvertent whistle stopping play, the very spot where referees agreed that Matthews had recovered the lateral for Cleveland. Later, Moon threw his third interception of the day, this one to Mark Harper, who returned it 17 yards with a facemask penalty against Alonzo Highsmith adding another 11. Cleveland took over on the Houston 11, and eventually scored on Pagel's 14-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter that gave the Browns the lead, 16–14. However, the Oilers marched on a 76-yard drive in which Moon completed passes to Jamie Williams and Drew Hill for gains of 14 and 18 yards, while Pinkett had a 27-yard carry. Rookie running back Lorenzo White capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run. After that, the Oilers stopped Cleveland on their next two drives, including Johnson's interception that set up Zendejas' 49-yard field goal, giving them a 24–16 lead with less than two minutes left in the game.\nWith no two-point conversion option (that would not be adopted by the league until 1994), Cleveland needed two scores to come back. Pagel led the Browns 71 yards to score on his 2-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, cutting the score to 24–23 with 31 seconds left. Cleveland attempted an onside kick, which they failed to recover, but got another chance due to an Oilers penalty. Then the Browns recovered, but had to do it over again due to a penalty against them. Finally on the third try, Cleveland was penalized for touching the ball before it went 10 yards, resulting in a penalty that gave Houston the ball and the win.\nPagel completed 17 of 25 passes for 179 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Wright had two interceptions.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Oilers and Browns.\nMonday, December 26, 1988.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 28, Los Angeles Rams 17.\nVikings safety Joey Browner recorded two interceptions in the first quarter to set up a two-touchdown lead that the Rams could never recover from. Browner also finished the game with seven tackles, had the Vikings' only sack of the day, and recovered a Rams onside kick attempt to seal the win.\nBrowner's first interception, on third and 17 from the Vikings 32, led to a 73-yard drive by Minnesota that featured Wade Wilson's 34-yard completion to reserve receiver Jim Gustafson and was capped by running back Alfred Anderson's 7-yard touchdown run. Then on the first play of the Rams next drive, Browner intercepted another pass from Jim Everett and returned it 14 yards to the Los Angeles 17-yard line, where Allen Rice took it in for a touchdown on the next play.\nIn the second quarter, the Rams had three chances to score, but only managed to get points once. First, Mike Lansford missed a 41-yard field goal attempt (later matched by a 44-yard miss by Minnesota's Chuck Nelson). Then they drove to a third and 1 on the Vikings 30 and were stopped for no gain on consecutive running plays. But just before halftime, Everett led the team 70 yards to cut the lead in half with his 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Damone Johnson.\nMinnesota took the second half kickoff and moved the ball all the way to the end zone with a 1-yard touchdown run by Anderson, increasing their lead to 21–7. The Rams countered with a 33-yard field goal from Lansford, but in the fourth quarter, Wilson completed a 44-yard pass to Anthony Carter on the LA 5-yard line. On the next play, he threw a touchdown pass to tight end Carl Hilton, giving the team a 28–10 lead and essentially putting the game out of reach. The Rams managed one more touchdown with 1:11 left in the game on Everett's 11-yard pass to tight end Pete Holohan, but Browner recovered their onside kick attempt and the Vikings ran out the rest of the clock.\nWilson finished the game with 253 passing yards and a touchdown, while Carter caught four passes for 102 yards. Rams linebacker Kevin Greene had three sacks.\nTo date, this was the final NFL playoff game to take place on a Monday until 2022.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Rams and Vikings. Minnesota won four of the previous five meetings.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 31, 1988.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 20, Philadelphia Eagles 12.\nIn a game known as the Fog Bowl, the Bears defeated the Eagles 20–12, in a contest in which a heavy, dense fog rolled over Chicago's Soldier Field during the second quarter and cut visibility to about 15–20 yards for the rest of the game.\nChicago scored first with quarterback Mike Tomczak's 64-yard touchdown pass to Dennis McKinnon. The Eagles responded by driving to the Chicago 26-yard line, but kicker Luis Zendejas missed a 43-yard field goal attempt. Philadelphia quickly got the ball back after linebacker Seth Joyner intercepted a pass from Tomczak on the next play and returned it 8 yards to the Bears 31-yard line. This time they managed to score with Zendejas' 42-yard field goal, but only after committing two costly mistakes: twice on the drive Philadelphia had touchdowns nullified by penalties, both on running back Anthony Toney. The Bears then drove to the Eagles 33-yard line on their ensuing drive, but it stalled there and kicker Kevin Butler missed a 51-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to Philadelphia with great field position. Quarterback Randall Cunningham then led the Eagles down the field with two completions to fullback Keith Byars for gains of 13 and 24 yards. A few plays later, faced with 3rd and 32, Cunningham completed a 31-yard pass to Ron Johnson, bringing up 4th and 1 on the Bears 4-yard line. Cunningham tried to convert the 4th down with a QB sneak, but after a chain measurement which took several minutes, officials ruled the ball short of a first down. The Eagles soon got another chance to score when Andre Waters forced a fumble from Cap Boso that was recovered by defensive back Wes Hopkins on the Chicago 15. Following another missed chance at a touchdown when rookie tight end Keith Jackson dropped a wide open pass in the end zone, Zendejas' 29-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 7–6.\nPhiladelphia tackled Chicago returner Dennis Gentry on the 22 on the ensuing kickoff, but the kick had to be redone due to an offsides penalty on the Eagles. This proved to be hugely beneficial for Chicago, as on the second kick, Glen Kozlowski returned the ball 23 yards to the Philadelphia 44-yard line. A few plays later, Tomczak's 30-yard completion to Ron Morris gave Chicago a first down on the Eagles 4-yard line, and Neal Anderson ran for a touchdown on the next play to give them a 14–6 lead. Then after forcing a punt, Thomas Sanders' 58-yard run set up a 46-yard field goal by Butler, increasing Chicago's lead to 17–6 with less than 2:03 left before halftime. At this point, a thick fog rolled on to field, obscuring vision so much that a CBS helicopter providing aerial coverage for the game was forced to land. Meanwhile, Philadelphia struck back with a 65-yard completion from Cunningham to Jackson that set up Zendejas' 30-yard field goal, making the score 17–9. Philadelphia got another chance to score when linebacker Todd Bell intercepted a pass from Tomczak, giving the Eagles the ball on the Bears 42-yard line with just over 30 seconds left in the half. But this was taken away as Bears linebacker Mickey Pruitt intercepted Cunningham to bring an end to the following drive.\nPhiladelphia took the second half kickoff and drove to the Bears 12-yard line, only to lose the ball again when Cunningham threw a pass that went off the hands of Toney and was intercepted by Vestee Jackson, who returned the ball 51 yards to the Eagles 41-yard line. Chicago then drove to the 15, but also came up empty when Butler's field goal attempt went off the goal post. Following a punt, Tomczak was knocked out of the game by a massive hit from Eagles defensive end Reggie White, while Terry Hoage intercepted his pass and returned it 12 yards to the Chicago 18-yard line. Three plays later, Zendejas kicked a 35-yard field goal, making the score 17–12 with less than two minutes left in the third quarter.\nChicago, now led by Jim McMahon, responded with their next drive, converting a 23-yard run by Anderson into a 27-yard Butler field goal to go back up by 8 points, 20–12 with 12:34 left in the game. Philadelphia responded with a drive to the Bears 22, but on third down, a long sack by Sean Smith pushed them out of field goal range. The next time they got the ball, Maurice Douglass intercepted a pass from Cunningham, enabling Chicago to run out the rest of the clock.\nCunningham finished the game with 407 passing yards, but was unable to lead his team to a single touchdown and was intercepted three times. Other than a 64-yard touchdown pass, Tomczak was dominated the rest of the game by the Eagles defense, completing only 10 of 20 passes for 174 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions. Sanders rushed 8 times for 94 yards and caught a pass for 8. McKinnon finished the game with four receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown. Byars rushed for 34 yards and caught nine passes for 103 yards. Jackson caught seven passes for 142 yards.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Eagles and Bears. Philadelphia won the only prior meeting.\nAFC: Cincinnati Bengals 21, Seattle Seahawks 13.\nSeattle's defense completely shut down Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason, the NFL's MVP and top rated quarterback during the season, as he completed just seven of 19 passes for 108 yards. But they were unable to contain Cincinnati on the ground. The Bengals recorded 254 rushing yards (126 of them and a touchdown from fullback Ickey Woods, a franchise postseason record, 72 from James Brooks, and 47 from Stanley Wilson), while holding the Seahawks to 18.\nNearly half of Esiason's passing yards on the day came from two completions on their opening possession, a 30-yarder to Cris Collinsworth along the right sideline and a 23-yard leaping catch on the middle of the field by Eddie Brown, as the team consumed 5:49 with an 11-play, 85-yard drive and scored on Wilson's 3-yard touchdown run. Following an exchange of punts, Bengals cornerback Eric Thomas intercepted a long pass from Dave Krieg on the Bengals 25-yard line. Tight end Rodney Holman subsequently caught two passes for 20 yards and Brooks ripped off a 26-yard run as the team drove to a 14–0 lead on Wilson's second 3-yard touchdown run just over four minutes into the second quarter. Seattle was forced to a three-and-out on their possession, and Ira Hillary returned Ruben Rodriguez's 42-yard punt three yards to the Bengals 44-yard line. On the next play, Woods took a handoff and raced down the right sideline for a 30-yard carry to the Seattle 26. Then Brooks ran the ball in the opposite direction, rushing 17 yards to the 9. Wilson got the ball next, slicing through the middle for an 8-yard gain. The Seahawks defense managed to stuff Woods for no gain on the next play, but on third down, he scored a 1-yard touchdown run to give the Bengals a 21–0 lead with 7:40 left in the half.\nAt the end of the next drive, the Seahawks finally got a chance to score when Hillary muffed a punt and Melvin Jenkins recovered for Seattle on the Bengals 24-yard line. Two plays later, Krieg's 14-yard completion to fullback John L. Williams (Seattle's longest gain of the half) brought up first down and goal. But on the next play, nose tackle Tim Krumrie stripped the ball from Williams and defensive end Jim Skow recovered it to keep the score 21–0 at halftime. The Bengals had dominated the first half, massively outgaining Seattle in rushing yards (167–0), total yards (241–49), first downs (16–3), and time of possession (20:35–9:25).\nMidway through the third quarter, Seattle drove deep into Bengals territory, aided by a 23-yard reception by Williams and a 24-yard pass interference penalty against Thomas on third and 21. But once again the Seahawks failed to score when defensive back Ray Horton broke up Krieg's pass on fourth down and goal from the 2-yard line. Cincinnati then drove to the Seattle 3-yard line, featuring a 24-yard catch by Holman, but they also turned the ball over on downs, as Woods was dropped for a 1-yard gain on fourth down and 2 with under a minute left in the third quarter.\nEarly in the final quarter, after Krieg was intercepted by Solomon Wilcots, Jacob Green forced a fumble while sacking Esiason and defensive end Joe Nash recovered it. Now with the ball on the Bengals 31-yard line, Seattle attempted a fourth quarter comeback. Krieg started off the drive with a pair of completions to rookie receiver Brian Blades and tight end John Spagnola for gains of 17 and seven yards before eventually converting a fourth down and 3 with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Williams, cutting the score to 21–7 with 11:40 left in the game. Then after forcing a punt, Seattle drove 69 yards, including a 32-yard reception by Ray Butler, to score on Krieg's 1-yard touchdown run with 6:04 remaining. But Norm Johnson missed the extra point, keeping his team behind by two scores, 21–13. Later in the quarter, Cincinnati punter Lee Johnson essentially put the game away with a 43-yard kick that pinned Seattle back at their own 2-yard line with just over two minutes remaining, and the Seahawks turned the ball over on downs on their final drive.\nWilliams finished the game with 11 receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown, along with 10 rushing yards.\nAfter the game, the Bengals accused Seattle of having their players fake injuries in an attempt to stop the game and counter Cincinnati's frequent use of the no-huddle offense. Nash and Ken Clarke both collapsed a total of six times during the game, all before third down plays. In each case they returned to play in the game.\nThis ended up being the Seahawks’ last playoff game until 1999. This was also the last divisional playoff game contested in December.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Bengals.\nSunday, January 1, 1989.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 17, Houston Oilers 10.\nThis was the first home playoff game for Buffalo since the 1966 AFL Championship Game. Although both teams blew scoring chances throughout the game, the Bills dominated Houston for most of the time, blocking a punt, converting a turnover into the game-clinching field goal, and forcing a turnover on Houston's final drive to defeat a comeback attempt.\nOn their first drive of the game, Buffalo drove to the Oilers 18-yard line. But a bad snap on third down pushed them back to the 32 and Scott Norwood came up short on a 50-yard field goal attempt. Houston then moved the ball to the Bills 32, but Bruce Smith's 13-yard sack of quarterback Warren Moon on third down pushed them out of field goal range. On the ensuing punt, Greg Montgomery's kick was blocked by Buffalo safety Leonard Smith, allowing the Bills to take over on the Oilers 46. Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly subsequently completed two passes to Trumaine Johnson for 28 yards on a 46-yard drive that ended with Robb Riddick's 1-yard touchdown run. Houston responded by driving 71 yards, with Moon completing a 21-yard pass to Drew Hill and Alonzo Highsmith rushing for a 31-yard gain, to score with a 35-yard field goal from Tony Zendejas. Following a punt, Houston threatened to score again with a drive to the Bills 25-yard line, but Smith blocked Zendejas' second field goal attempt and the score remained 7–3 at halftime.\nIn the third quarter, Houston got another scoring opportunity when Tracey Eaton intercepted a pass from Kelly on the Bills 47-yard line. Moon led his team inside the 5-yard line, but after an errant pitchout lost 12 yards, Zendejas missed a 31-yard field goal attempt. Following an exchange of punts, Buffalo drove 59 yards in six plays, with Kelly completing a pass to Chris Burkett for 26 yards and rushing for 10 yards, to score on rookie running back Thurman Thomas' 11-yard touchdown run. Near the end of the quarter, Kelly's 55-yard completion to Andre Reed gave the Bills a first down on the Houston 2-yard line. But the Oilers defense made a big goal line stand, keeping them out of the end zone for four consecutive plays to force a turnover on downs.\nTwo plays after the turnover, Mark Kelso intercepted a pass from Moon and returned it 28 yards to the Oilers 18-yard line, setting up Norwood's 27-yard field goal to increase their lead to 17–3. Buffalo's defense forced another turnover on Houston's ensuing drive when Derrick Burroughs recovered a fumble from receiver Haywood Jeffires on the Oilers 26-yard line. The Bills now had a chance to put the game away, but Norwood hit the uprights on a 36-yard field goal attempt.\nMoon then completed four passes, including a 29-yarder to receiver Leonard Harris, on a 9-play, 80-yard drive. A pass interference penalty on Burroughs in the end zone moved the ball to the Bills 1, and running back Mike Rozier ran it in from there, cutting the score to 17–10 with just over five minutes left in the game. The Oilers subsequently forced a punt at the two-minute warning, but Steve Tasker forced a fumble while tackling wide receiver Curtis Duncan during the punt return, and linebacker Ray Bentley recovered the ball, allowing Buffalo to run out the clock.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Oilers and Bills. It was the first Divisional Round playoff victory for the Bills, clinching their first appearance in an AFC Championship in team history.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 34, Minnesota Vikings 9.\nIn what would turn out to be Bill Walsh's final home game as 49ers head coach, San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana threw for 178 yards and three touchdowns to wide receiver Jerry Rice, while running back Roger Craig rushed for 135 yards and two touchdowns and safety Ronnie Lott added two interceptions. Overall, the 49ers gained 376 yards, including 201 on the ground, while holding the Vikings to 262 yards and sacking quarterback Wade Wilson six times. 49ers defensive end Larry Roberts had 2.5 sacks.\nMinnesota scored first on a 51-yard, 12-play drive that ended with Chuck Nelson's 47-yard field goal. But later in the quarter, John Taylor's 14-yard punt return and a penalty against Minnesota's Sam Anno gave the 49ers the ball on the Vikings 48, setting up Montana's first touchdown pass to Rice on a 2-yard toss. On the next series, Lott's interception gave San Francisco a first down on the Minnesota 30-yard line. Rice started off their drive with a 21-yard run on a double reverse play, and eventually caught a 4-yard touchdown pass that gave the 49ers a 14–3 lead in the second quarter. Rice added a third touchdown reception with 38 seconds left in the half, increasing the team's lead to 21–3.\nThe Vikings scored on their first possession of the second half with Wilson's 5-yard pass to Hassan Jones, but Nelson missed the extra point and the team would get no closer than 21–9. In the fourth quarter, Craig finished off an 80-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run, and scored on an NFL postseason record 80-yard touchdown run on the 49ers' next drive.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Vikings and 49ers. Both teams split the first two meetings.\nConference championships.\nSunday, January 8, 1989.\nAFC: Cincinnati Bengals 21, Buffalo Bills 10.\nBefore the game began, a controversy arose over Cincinnati's no-huddle offense. Bills coach Marv Levy criticized the strategy as against the rules, as it was done with intent to deceive. There was suggestion that the Bills might counter this by simulating injuries in order to stop the clock, as the Seahawks were alleged to have done against the Bengals. However, Levy stated that the Bills would not do so. The NFL stated beforehand that neither action would result in a penalty. Prior to the game, both Levy and Cincinnati coach Sam Wyche told reporters that they did not believe that the other would behave unethically.\nThe Bengals forced three interceptions, and allowed only 45 rushing yards and 136 passing yards, while their offense held the ball for 39:29. Bills starting running back Thurman Thomas was held to just six yards on four carries, while quarterback Jim Kelly completed only 14 of 30 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown, with three interceptions. The Bills had only 10 first downs, one more than the AFC Championship record for the fewest ever, and failed to convert any of their 10 third down conversion attempts. Just like their previous game, the Bengals did not get much of a performance from NFL MVP Boomer Esiason, who completed only 11 of 20 passes for 94 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions. But once again, their running game was able to pick up the slack, gaining 175 yards on the ground, 102 yards and two touchdowns coming from fullback Ickey Woods.\nBuffalo started their first drive on their 46-yard line, but it ended with an interception by Bengals cornerback Lewis Billups. On the next play, Esiason's 29-yard run moved the team into scoring range. However, they also came up empty when Esiason's pass was intercepted by Bills linebacker Ray Bentley. Later on, Cincinnati took a 7–0 lead in the first quarter after Eric Thomas' 26-yard interception return to the Bills 4-yard line set up Woods' 1-yard touchdown run. However, a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty against Bengals running back Stanley Wilson (one of six personal foul penalties in the game, two by the Bengals and four by the Bills) after the touchdown was assessed on the ensuing kickoff, and Buffalo ended up getting the ball with good field position with Ronnie Harmon's 22-yard return to the 43-yard line. Kelly subsequently led the Bills back with four consecutive completions, starting out with a pair of throws to receiver Andre Reed for gains of nine and 19 yards and then hooking up with Trumaine Johnson for a 22-yard gain to the Bengals 9-yard line. On the next play, Kelly found Reed in the right corner of the end zone for a touchdown pass to tie the game.\nFollowing a punt, Buffalo drove to the Bengals 26-yard line, only to have Scott Norwood miss a 43-yard field goal attempt. The Bengals then took over and stormed down the field on an 11-play, 74-yard drive, including a 16-yard run by Woods, to score on Esiason's 10-yard touchdown pass to running back James Brooks. Later on, Mark Kelso intercepted a pass from Esiason and returned it 25 yards to the Bengals 29-yard line, setting up a 39-yard field goal by Norwood to cut the Bills deficit to 14–10 by halftime.\nThe Bengals took over the game in the second half, forcing Buffalo to start all of their drives from inside their own 23-yard line as they held the ball for only 9:04, totaling 53 yards, two first downs, and no points. On their first three drives of the second half, the Bills totaled −12 yards. Midway through the third quarter, Cincinnati punter Lee Johnson pinned the Bills at their own 1-yard line with a 58-yard kick. Buffalo then went three-and-out, and Bengals receiver Ira Hillary returned John Kidd's 50-yard punt 15 yards to the Bills 40. Three plays into their ensuing drive, Cincinnati faced fourth down and 4. Wilson ran six yards for a first down on a fake punt, enabling the Bengals to keep driving for a clutch score. Later in the drive, Derrick Burroughs was ejected from the game for striking receiver Tim McGee in the head, turning what would have been a third and goal from the 8 into a first and goal from the 4-yard line, and Cincinnati ended up scoring with Woods' 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter, increasing their lead to 21–10. The Bills later managed a drive to the Bengals 18-yard line, but safety David Fulcher picked off a desperate fourth-down pass from Kelly in the end zone.\nThe Bills would not lose another game to the Bengals until Week 4 of the 2011 NFL season.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Bills and Bengals. Cincinnati won the only previous meeting.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Chicago Bears 3.\nDespite playing in a game-time temperature of , a wind chill of , and wind gusts up to , the 49ers scored a touchdown in every quarter and gained 406 total yards of offense while limiting Chicago quarterback Jim McMahon to just 121 passing yards with no touchdowns and an interception. Chicago only made it inside the San Francisco 40-yard line twice during the entire NFC Championship game.\nSan Francisco quarterback Joe Montana threw for 288 yards and three touchdowns, including completing nine of 15 passes for 199 yards and two touchdowns in the first half. After the first five possessions of the game ended in punts, the 49ers faced a third and long from their own 39-yard line. Despite the high winds, Montana was able to throw a long pass to Rice, who, despite double coverage from Bears defenders Mike Richardson and Todd Krumm, was able to catch the pass and outrun both defenders to score a 61-yard touchdown.\nMidway through the second quarter, Jeff Fuller intercepted a pass from McMahon on the San Francisco 36, and the team moved the ball 64 yards on a drive that included Rice's 20-yard catch and Tom Rathman's 12-yard run on third and 10. Montana finished the series with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Rice in which he caught a low slant pass in stride and scored untouched. Chicago responded with a 25-yard field goal by Kevin Butler. Then Vestee Jackson recovered a fumble from receiver John Taylor on the Bears 18-yard line with 2:45 left in the half. Chicago subsequently advanced to the 49ers 47, but on third down, cornerback Don Griffin tackled Neal Anderson for a 5-yard loss and forced a punt.\nIn the third quarter, the 49ers marched 78 yards, including a 17-yard reception by Rice, to score on Montana's 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Frank. San Francisco's final score was Rathman's 4-yard touchdown run.\nRice finished the game with five receptions for 133 yards and two touchdowns. Fuller had an interception and 10 tackles, while linebacker Michael Walter had 11. This was San Francisco's first playoff win on the road since the 1970 season. It was also the first time an NFC team won a conference title on the road since 1979.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the 49ers and Bears. San Francisco won the only prior meeting.\nSuper Bowl XXIII: San Francisco 49ers 20, Cincinnati Bengals 16.\nThis was the second Super Bowl meeting between the Bengals and 49ers. San Francisco won the only prior meeting."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1987 season began on January 3, 1988. The postseason tournament concluded with the Washington Redskins defeating the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXII, 42–10, on January 31, at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, CBS televised the NFC games, and ABC covered Super Bowl XXII.\nWild card playoffs.\nSunday, January 3, 1988.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 44, New Orleans Saints 10.\nIn the Saints' first playoff game (and first winning season) in history, the Vikings dominated the game by recording two sacks, forcing six turnovers, and allowing only 149 yards. It was a stunning victory for the underdog Vikings, who had barely made the playoffs with an 8–7 record after losing three of their last four games, including their season ending match at home against the Washington Redskins in which they blew a 10-point fourth quarter lead, costing them a chance to clinch a playoff slot. The Vikings would spend the rest of the day pondering their prospects until a Dallas win over St. Louis enabled them to snag the NFC's lowest postseason seed. The Vikings had also been plagued with quarterback problems all year, starting three different quarterbacks during the season. Wade Wilson had the most starts with 7, but coach Jerry Burns decided to start Tommy Kramer, who had been through so many injuries he had only started in 5 regular season games and had not finished any of them. Meanwhile, the Saints had the NFL's second best record at 12-3 and came into this game on a 9-game winning streak.\nNew Orleans scored first after Vikings quarterback Kramer's fumble on a bad snap led to Saints quarterback Bobby Hebert's 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Martin. Then, Kramer was sacked and the Vikings had to punt, but Saints returner Mel Gray accidentally hit the ball while trying to avoid it and the Vikings recovered on the New Orleans 27, leading to Chuck Nelson's 42-yard field goal. Kramer had to leave the game on the next drive with a pinched nerve in his neck, but the team would go on to win easily without him. Later in the quarter, they went up 10-7 when Anthony Carter returned a Saints punt for an 84-yard touchdown, setting a playoff record for the longest punt return TD.\nIn the second quarter, Vikings running back Darrin Nelson caught a screen pass from Wilson on 3rd and 10, and took off for a 37-yard gain to the Saints 1-yard line, setting up Wilson's 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Jordan. Then on Minnesota's next drive, running back Allen Rice threw a 10-yard touchdown to Carter on a halfback option play. Saints kicker Morten Andersen cut the score to 24–10 with a 40-yard field goal, but John Harris' interception of a Hebert pass on the Saints 35 led to Wilson's 44-yard touchdown completion on a \"Hail Mary\" pass to Hassan Jones on the last play of the first half. Time had expired on the previous play, but the Saints were penalized for having 12 men on the field, giving the Vikings one more play with no time left on the clock.\nThe Vikings went on dominating the second half, scoring two more Nelson field goals and an 8-yard touchdown run by D. J. Dozier.\nCarter, who had only returned three punts during the season, finished the game with six punt returns for a playoff record 143 yards, and also caught six passes for 79 yards and another score. Wilson finished the game completing 11 of 20 passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Vikings and Saints.\nAFC: Houston Oilers 23, Seattle Seahawks 20 (OT).\nOilers kicker Tony Zendejas won the game with a 42-yard field goal 8:05 into overtime. Although Houston outgained Seattle with 427 total offensive yards to 250, and Seattle was playing without star running back Curt Warner due to injury, the game remained close until the very end.\nOn the opening drive of the game, Seattle cornerback Melvin Jenkins intercepted Warren Moon's pass and returned it 28 yards to the Houston 46. Seahawks quarterback Dave Krieg then hit Steve Largent for a 33-yard completion, and eventually found him in the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown pass. This would be the extent of Seattle's first half success, as they gained just three yards with their next four possessions. Meanwhile, the Oilers responded with 13 unanswered points with two field goals by Zendejas (from 47 and 49 yards) and running back Mike Rozier's 1-yard rushing touchdown.\nIn the third quarter, Seattle running back Bobby Joe Edmonds returned a punt 54 yards to set up Norm Johnson's 33-yard field goal. Then a short Houston punt enabled Seattle to tie the game at 13 with Johnson's 41-yard kick at the end of the drive that went just 16 yards. Later in the third quarter, Moon threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Willie Drewrey to give his team a 20–13 lead. Houston later had two chances to put the game away in the fourth quarter, but Zendejas hit the uprights on a 52-yard field goal, and later missed a kick from 29 yards out. With only 1:47 left in regulation, Krieg started an 80-yard drive that included a 10-yard completion to Largent on fourth and 10. Krieg then picked up 26 yards on another completion to Largent, and followed it up with a 32-yard pass to Ray Butler on the Houston 12. On the next play, he finished it with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Largent, tying the game with 26 seconds left.\nSeattle won the coin toss in overtime, but had to punt. On Houston's ensuing drive, Fredd Young appeared to intercept a deflected pass; one official ruled a catch, but he was overruled and the call was not overturned by replay review, allowing Houston to keep the ball and drive to Zendejas' game winning score.\nAfter the game, replay official Tony Veteri explained the call on Young's potential interception: \"We could not tell whether the ball hit or not so we had to go with the call on the field. We did not get a clear-cut view of whether {Young} caught the ball before it hit the ground. Part of his arm covered up the ball. So we had to go with the call on the field.\" However, Young was livid: \"It was as clean as you can catch a ball,\" he said. \"There was no possible way that ball hit the ground. I know I had it.\"\nLargent finished the game with seven receptions for 132 yards and two touchdowns, accounting for more than half his team's offense. Edmonds returned five kickoffs for 109 yards and three punts for 66. Moon completed 21 of 32 passes for 273 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. It was Houston's first playoff win since 1979, added on to their first winning season since 1980.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Oilers.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 9, 1988.\nAFC: Cleveland Browns 38, Indianapolis Colts 21.\nFelix Wright's interception deep inside his own territory sparked his team to score 17 unanswered points.\nCleveland started off the game with a 15-play, 86-yard drive, converting five third downs on the way to Bernie Kosar's 15-yard touchdown pass to Earnest Byner. The Colts stormed right back, as quarterback Jack Trudeau threw completions for gains of 18 and 21 yards before finishing the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Pat Beach. Cleveland responded by driving from their own 35 to the Indianapolis 2-yard line, but on third down and goal, Colts safety Freddie Robinson intercepted Kosar's pass in the end zone. After an exchange of punts, the Browns took a 14–7 lead on Kosar's 39-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Langhorne with 1:51 left in the second quarter. Once again, the Colts responded with a touchdown of their own, moving the ball 59 yards in seven plays and tying the score on Trudeau's 19-yard touchdown pass to Eric Dickerson with 40 seconds left in the half.\nIndianapolis took the second half kickoff and stormed down the field, overcoming some blown plays along the way. During the drive, Trudeau was sacked for an 11-yard loss on second down and 11, but a defensive holding penalty negated the play and gave the Colts a first down. Later on, Dickerson fumbled the ball, but Trudeau picked it up and threw a 15-yard first down completion to Bill Brooks. Eventually, Indianapolis reached the Browns 20-yard line, but linebacker Eddie Johnson hit Trudeau as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go straight up in the air where it was intercepted by Wright at the 14.\nAfter the interception, Kosar completed five of seven passes for 65 yards while Byner rushed six times for 20 and capped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, putting the Browns back in the lead, 21–14. Then after forcing a punt, Matt Bahr's 22-yard field goal gave the Browns a 10-point lead with just over 11 minutes left in the game. Following another punt, Byner fumbled the ball on a 25-yard run, but running back Herman Fontenot recovered the ball at the Colts 6-yard line, turning the play into a 41-yard gain. Three plays later, Kosar's 2-yard touchdown pass to receiver Brian Brennan made the score 31–14 with 3:44 left.\nHowever, the Colts were not quite out of the game. With 1:07 left in regulation, Albert Bentley's 1-yard touchdown run cut the score to 31–21. Then Indianapolis recovered an onside kick on their own 41-yard line. But on the first play after that, Browns defensive end Al Baker sacked Trudeau for a 9-yard loss, knocking him out of the game. One play later, backup quarterback Sean Salisbury's pass was intercepted by Frank Minnifield, who returned the ball 48 yards for a touchdown to put the game away.\nByner finished the game with 122 rushing yards, four receptions for 36 yards, and two touchdowns. Kosar completed 20 of 31 passes for 229 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Colts and Browns. The Colts won two of the prior three meetings when they were based in Baltimore.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 36, San Francisco 49ers 24.\nAided by wide receiver Anthony Carter's 10 receptions for an NFL playoff record 227 receiving yards, the Vikings upset the top seeded 49ers, who had earned the league's best record during the regular season at 13–2.\nMinnesota drove 77 yards on their opening drive, including an 11-yard run by quarterback Wade Wilson out of shotgun formation on third and 7, to score on Chuck Nelson's 21-yard field goal. Then after an exchange of punts, 49ers quarterback Joe Montana's completions to Roger Craig and John Taylor for gains of 18 and 33 yards helped advance the ball 74 yards in 10 plays to tie the game on a 34-yard field goal from Ray Wersching.\nMinnesota broke the tie in the second quarter with 17 unanswered points. First Wilson completed two passes to Carter for 23 total yards and rushed for 12 on a 70-yard drive that he finished with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Carl Hilton. Following a 49ers punt, Wilson's 63-yard completion to Carter set up a second Nelson field goal, increasing the Vikings lead to 13–3. Then safety Reggie Rutland intercepted a pass from Montana and returned it 45 yards for a touchdown. The 49ers had a chance to cut into the lead before halftime, but Wersching missed a 26-yard field goal attempt, and the score would remain 20–3.\n49ers safety Jeff Fuller returned an interception 48 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter, but the Vikings stormed right back, with Carter gaining 30 yards on an end around play as the team drove 68 yards to score on Wilson's short touchdown pass to Hassan Jones, making the score 27–10. Later on, San Francisco coach Bill Walsh had enough of Montana and replaced him with Steve Young. The decision appeared to pay off, as Young hooked up with Craig for a 31-yard completion and later took the ball into the end zone himself on a 5-yard run, cutting their deficit to 27–17. But Minnesota countered with Wilson's 40-yard completion to Carter that set up Nelson's third field goal of the day. Wersching missed a 48-yard field goal on San Francisco's next drive, and the team would go into the final quarter still trailing 30–17.\nIn the fourth quarter, Fuller was nailed with a 15-yard facemask penalty while tackling Vikings running back Allen Rice after he gained 19 yards on a screen pass, setting up Nelson's 46-yard field goal to put the Vikings up 33–17. Then Carl Lee intercepted a pass from Young, allowing Minnesota to run more time off the clock. Following a punt, Young led the 49ers 68 yards in eight plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Frank, but by then there was only 3:42 left in the game. Nelson later kicked a postseason record fifth field goal, this one from 23 yards, to completely dash any hope of a miracle comeback.\nIn addition to his 227 receiving yards, Carter had a 30-yard carry and returned two punts for 21 yards. Vikings outside linebacker Chris Doleman had two sacks. Wilson completed 20/34 passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Nelson finished the day a perfect 5/5 on field goals, a notable contrast to his lowly 13/24 performance during the regular season. Montana was held to just 12/26 completions for 109 yards with one interception. Young had a solid performance with 12/17 completions for 158 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading San Francisco in rushing with 72 yards on six carries. It was a sign of what lay in store for 49ers fans, as they would watch him and Montana compete fiercely for the starting quarterback job until Young inherited the starting position when Joe Montana suffered a serious elbow injury during the 1991 preseason. Until the 2007–08 NFL playoffs with the Cowboys losing to the Giants, this was the last time the No. 1 seed in the NFC did not advance to the NFC Championship Game. After the Cowboys loss, three of the next four No. 1 seeds in the NFC would lose their first playoff game (2008 Giants, 2010 Falcons and 2011 Packers).\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Vikings and 49ers. San Francisco won the only previous meeting.\nSunday, January 10, 1988.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 21, Chicago Bears 17.\nThe Redskins overcame a 14–0 Bears lead by scoring three touchdowns. Early in the first quarter, Chicago's Richard Dent forced a fumble from Washington quarterback Doug Williams that defensive tackle Steve McMichael recovered on the Redskins 30-yard line, leading to running back Calvin Thomas' 2-yard touchdown run. Later on, Washington running back George Rogers was tackled for a 1-yard loss while trying to convert a fourth and 1 from the Chicago 32-yard line. The Bears then drove 67 yards on a drive that consumed 9:04 and ended with Jim McMahon throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to Ron Morris.\nHowever, Washington tied the game before halftime. First, Williams' 32-yard completion to Ricky Sanders on third down and nine and his 14-yard completion to tight end Clint Didier set up a 3-yard touchdown run by Rogers with 4:51 left in the half. Then after Chicago kicker Kevin Butler missed a 48-yard field goal, Washington got the ball back with 1:51 and made a big play when a late hit by cornerback Maurice Douglass turned a 13-yard catch by Sanders into a 28-yard gain. After two receptions by Gary Clark for 23 yards, Williams tied the game with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Didier.\nWith 11:40 left in the third quarter, Redskins cornerback Darrell Green scored on a 52-yard punt return for a touchdown (Green injured his ribs hurdling over a Chicago defender en route to the end zone). Chicago responded with a 44-yard reception by Willie Gault that set up Butler's 25-yard field goal with 4:41 remaining in the quarter, but were shut down for the rest of the game. Green would return for just one play before leaving as a result of his injury, but Washington's defense still held on to their lead without him, intercepting three passes from McMahon in the second half.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Washington drove into the Bears' red zone and sent their special teams unit to attempt a 35-yard field goal. Backup quarterback Jay Schroeder, who was the holder on the play, called an audible for a fake field goal, but due to the roaring crowd at Soldier Field, his receivers didn't hear the call. As a result, he had no one to throw to after the snap, and slipped on the 25-yard line while trying to run for a first down. Chicago then took over and drove to the Washington 14-yard line. But with just over nine minutes left in the game, McMahon's pass was intercepted by Barry Wilburn in the end zone. Later on, McMahon was intercepted again, this time by Dennis Woodberry at the Chicago 43. Three plays later, Washington attempted to put the game away with a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches, but Williams was stopped short with 1:13 left, giving the Bears one last chance to drive for a winning score. However, the Redskins defense again rose to the occasion, forcing Walter Payton out of bounds one yard short of the first-down marker on fourth down and 8.\nThis was the final game in the Hall of Fame career of Payton, who rushed for 85 yards and caught three passes for 20 yards. With this win, Joe Gibbs advanced to his fourth NFC Championship Game in his seven years as the Redskins head coach.\nThis game, along with the earlier win by the Vikings over the 49ers, would mark the first time the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in a conference both lost. The feat has only been done twice more, in the AFC in the 2006–07 NFL playoffs with the Colts and Patriots beating the Ravens and Chargers, and again in the NFC in the 2008–09 NFL playoffs with the Cardinals beating the Panthers and Eagles defeating the Giants.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Redskins and Bears. Both teams split the previous six meetings.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 34, Houston Oilers 10.\nThe Broncos jumped to an early 14–0 lead by converting two turnovers into touchdowns.\nOn the second play of the Oilers 1st drive, Steve Wilson recovered a fumbled lateral pass by running back Mike Rozier (the play was referred to as the \"Stagger Lee\" play after the 1923 folk song) at the Houston 1-yard line, setting up Gene Lang's 1-yard touchdown run. Then on the Oilers next drive, they drove 60 yards to the Denver 20, only to lose the ball when linebacker Karl Mecklenburg intercepted a pass from Warren Moon and returned it 18 yards to the Broncos 28-yard line. Denver quarterback John Elway hooked up with tight end Clarence Kay for a 29-yard completion on the next play. Five plays later, he completed a 27-yard pass to Kay for a touchdown that gave Denver a 14–0 lead. Both teams exchanged field goals in the second quarter before Elway threw a 1-yard touchdown to Kay.\nIn the third quarter, with Denver up 27–3, the Oilers drove to the Broncos 7-yard line, but lost the ball again with a Moon pass that Mark Haynes intercepted and returned 57 yards. In the fourth quarter, Moon completed a 19-yard touchdown to wide receiver Ernest Givins, but it was countered with Elway's 3-yard touchdown run.\nBroncos receiver Vance Johnson caught four passes for 105 yards, but was injured in the game and had to miss the AFC Championship Game and saw limited action in Super Bowl XXII. Mike Harden, starting at strong safety in place of an injured Dennis Smith, was knocked out of the game himself with a broken right forearm.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Oilers and Broncos. Houston won the only previous meeting.\nConference championships.\nSunday, January 17, 1988.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 17, Minnesota Vikings 10.\nIn a defensive battle, the Redskins played a little better by limiting the Vikings to only 76 rushing yards and piling up eight sacks among seven different players (Dave Butz, Kurt Gouveia, Ravin Caldwell, Dexter Manley, Charles Mann, Alvin Walton, and Clarence Vaughn). The Vikings string of playoff upsets came to an end in a game that proved to be just as hard fought and intense as Washington's 27–24 overtime victory over them in Week 16 of the regular season.\nMinnesota started off with a drive to the Redskins 35, but decided to punt rather than risk a long field goal. Bucky Scribner's 33-yard punt pinned the Redskins back at their own 2-yard line, but it didn't stop them from scoring on a 98-yard drive that included a 28-yard run by receiver Ricky Sanders on a reverse play and ended with running back Kelvin Bryant's 42-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Doug Williams. The Vikings went three and out on their next drive, and Scribner's punt traveled just 19 yards to the Redskins 45-yard line. Washington subsequently moved the ball to the Vikings 21, but came up empty when Ali Haji-Sheikh missed a 38-yard field goal.\nMost of the remaining first half was a defensive struggle. With just over five minutes left, Washington running back Timmy Smith broke off a 34-yard run to the Vikings 31-yard line. But they failed to score again because of another missed field goal from Haji-Sheikh, this one from 47 yards. Minnesota took over and tied the game before halftime with quarterback Wade Wilson's 36-yard completion to tight end Steve Jordan setting up a 23-yard touchdown pass to Leo Lewis.\nIn the third quarter, Redskins linebacker Mel Kaufman picked off a pass that had been deflected by Butz (which turned out to be the only turnover of the game) and returned it 10 yards to the Minnesota 17-yard line to set up Haji-Sheikh's 28-yard field goal. In the final quarter, Wilson got the Vikings moving on a 10-play, 52-yard drive, finding receiver Anthony Carter for 23 yards, running back Allen Rice for 15, and Jordan for nine. Minnesota eventually got a first down on the Redskins 3-yard line, but Washington's defense made a stand, stopping them on three consecutive running plays and forcing them to settle for Chuck Nelson's 18-yard field goal to tie the game. The Redskins then marched 70 yards in eight plays, including Williams' 43-yard completion to Gary Clark, to score on Williams' 7-yard touchdown pass to Clark and take the lead, 17–10, with 5:06 left in the game, giving the Vikings one more chance for a game-tying drive. Minnesota subsequently advanced to the Washington 6-yard line, with Wilson completing five passes on the way there, but on fourth down and four with 56 seconds left in the game, running back Darrin Nelson dropped a potential touchdown catch after being tackled by cornerback Darrell Green, turning the ball over on downs and enabling the Redskins to run out the clock.\nWilliams completed only nine of 26 passes for 119 yards, but threw two touchdowns and no interceptions, while his team gained 161 yards on the ground, 72 from Smith. Wilson completed 19 of 39 passes for 243 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Carter caught seven passes for 85 yards, and returned four punts for 57 yards.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Vikings and Redskins. Minnesota won two of the previous three meetings.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 38, Cleveland Browns 33.\nThis game is best remembered for The Fumble when Browns running back Earnest Byner fumbled at the Broncos' 2-yard line with 1:05 left. Also, these two teams were scheduled to meet during the regular season, however, the game happened to be scheduled during the week of games that was canceled (they were to meet on \"Monday Night Football\").\nSeveral early Cleveland miscues helped the Broncos jump to an early 14–0 lead. First, Cleveland kick returner Gerald McNeil was tackled by Tony Boddie on his own 12-yard line. Then after a sack by Denver players Simon Fletcher, Bernie Kosar threw a pass that went through the arms of Webster Slaughter and into the hands of linebacker Freddie Gilbert on the Browns 17, setting up John Elway's 8-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Nattiel. On Cleveland's next drive, fullback Kevin Mack lost a fumble while being tackled by Tony Lilly. One play later, Gene Lang's 42-yard run (surpassing the team's previous longest run of the season of 29 yards) gave Denver a first and goal situation. Elway eventually threw an incomplete pass on third and goal from the Browns 3-yard line, but a defensive holding penalty on Frank Minnifield gave Denver a first down at the 1, and running back Steve Sewell scored a touchdown on the next play.\nAfter the ensuing kickoff, Kosar completed a 25-yard pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome and a 19-yarder to Clarence Weathers on third down and 17 on the way to a 29-yard field goal by Matt Bahr two minutes into the second quarter. But Denver stormed right back on an 80-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Lang, making the score 21–3. A sack by Denver's Rulon Jones helped force the Browns to a three and out. This time all the Broncos could manage was a missed field goal by Rich Karlis. But once again Cleveland could not move the ball and turned it over with a fumble from receiver Brian Brennan that was recovered by cornerback Randy Robbins. This time the Browns defense stepped up, sacking Elway twice and forcing Denver's first punt of the game. After that, Kosar's 24-yard completion to Slaughter set up a 45-yard field goal attempt by Bahr, but he sent it wide right as time expired in the half.\nFour plays into the second half, Felix Wright intercepted a pass from Elway, setting up Kosar's 18-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Langhorne. But less than a minute and a half later, Elway threw a short pass to receiver Mark Jackson, who broke a tackle from Mark Harper and evaded a tackle attempt from Wright on the way to an 80-yard touchdown reception (the longest play in Denver postseason history), giving the Broncos a 28–10 lead. Cleveland responded with two consecutive touchdowns. First Kosar threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Byner. Then Broncos returner Ken Bell muffed the kickoff and was downed inside his own 10-yard line. Following a three and out, McNeil returned their punt to the Broncos 42. Kosar then completed four consecutive passes en route to a 4-yard touchdown run by Byner, making the score 28–24 with less than four minutes left in the third quarter. Denver struck back with a 38-yard field goal from Karlis to give them a seven-point lead going into the final quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Browns drove 87 yards and tied the score with Kosar's 4-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, but it was countered by Elway's 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder with four minutes left in the game.\nAfter the ensuing kickoff, the Browns got the ball on their own 25-yard line. Byner started out the drive with a 16-yard burst and a 2-yard run, and then Kosar completed two passes to Brennan for 33 total yards. Following an encroachment penalty on defensive lineman Andre Townsend and a 6-yard run by Byner, an offsides penalty on Denver linebacker Karl Mecklenburg moved the ball to the Broncos 8-yard line with 1:12 remaining in regulation. The Browns had moved 67 yards in just six plays covering 2:41. On the next play, Byner took a handoff and appeared to be on his way to score the game-tying touchdown. But he was stripped of the ball by Jeremiah Castille, and fumbled at the 2-yard line. The Broncos recovered the fumble (Castille made the recovery), gave the Browns an intentional safety, and went on to win, 38–33.\nByner finished the game with 67 rushing yards, seven receptions for 120 yards, and two touchdowns. Elway finished the game completing 14 of 26 attempts for 281 yards and three touchdowns with an interception, and also rushed for 36 yards. His top target was Jackson, who caught four passes for 134 yards and a touchdown. Nattiel added five receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown.\nThis game was later featured on \"NFL's Greatest Games\".\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Browns and Broncos. Denver won the only prior meeting the previous year.\nSuper Bowl XXII: Washington Redskins 42, Denver Broncos 10.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Redskins and Broncos."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1986 season began on December 28, 1986. The postseason tournament concluded with the New York Giants defeating the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI, 39–20, on January 25, 1987, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, while CBS televised the NFC games and Super Bowl XXI.\nWild card playoffs.\nSunday, December 28, 1986.\nAFC: New York Jets 35, Kansas City Chiefs 15.\nQuarterback Pat Ryan led the Jets to victory with three touchdown passes, while New York's defense held the Chiefs to 241 yards (the lowest total allowed by their defense all season) and forced three turnovers, in Kansas City's first postseason appearance since 1971.\nThe Chiefs scored first as backup quarterback Todd Blackledge, filling in for injured starter Bill Kenney, led the team on a 67-yard drive capped by running back Jeff Smith's 1-yard touchdown run, but Nick Lowery was unsuccessful with the following PAT. On their ensuing possession, the Jets faced fourth down and 6 on the Kansas City 33-yard line. Rather than attempt a long field goal, Ryan faked a pitch to Freeman McNeil and rushed for a 24-yard gain. Two plays later, McNeil scored on a 4-yard rushing touchdown to give the Jets a 7–6 lead.\nNew York now had the momentum and would not give it up for the rest of the game. On Kansas City's ensuing drive, New York defenders Harry Hamilton and Russell Carter shared a tackle on running back Larry Moriarty, forcing a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Kyle Clifton. Ryan then converted the turnover with a 1-yard touchdown pass to McNeil. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their next possession due to a sack by Mark Gastineau, and the Jets increased their lead to 21–6 with another score. The key player on this drive was receiver Al Toon, who made a 30-yard reception from Ryan, and later finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown catch.\nOn the first play of the third quarter, Jets linebacker Kevin McArthur increased his team's lead to 28–6 by returning an interception 21 yards for a touchdown, which would be the only score of the quarter. Most of it would be taken up by the Chiefs' ensuing drive, which ended with a failed fourth and 1 conversion attempt. In the fourth quarter, they finally managed to score when cornerback Albert Lewis recovered a blocked punt in the end zone for a touchdown. However, this was quickly countered on the Jets next possession as Ryan completed a 38-yard pass to Wesley Walker before finishing it with a 6-yard touchdown throw to tight end Billy Griggs (his first NFL reception). The only other score of the game would be a safety when Jets punter Dave Jennings ran out of the end zone in the game's closing minutes.\nMcNeil finished the game with 135 rushing yards, three receptions for 16 yards, and two touchdowns.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Jets. Kansas City won the only prior meeting when both teams were in the AFL.\nThis would be the last playoff win for the Jets until 1998.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 19, Los Angeles Rams 7.\nAlthough they outgained Washington in total yards 324–228, the Rams turned over the ball six times en route to a defeat against the Redskins.\nIn the first quarter, a fumble lost by Los Angeles running back Eric Dickerson led to Washington kicker Jess Atkinson's 25-yard field goal. The Redskins then extended their lead, 10–0, driving 60 yards to quarterback Jay Schroeder's 14-yard touchdown to running back Kelvin Bryant. A key play on the drive was a controversial pass interference penalty against Rams Pro Bowl cornerback LeRoy Irvin, which gave the Redskins 28 yards; 13 from the initial penalty and another 15 against Irvin for arguing with officials about it. LA had a great chance to respond when quarterback Jim Everett completed a 45-yard pass to Kevin House on the Redskins 28, but the drive ended with no points when Dickerson lost another fumble.\nIn the second quarter, Rams tight end David Hill lost a fumble due to a hit by Monte Coleman. Linebacker Neal Olkewicz recovered the ball and returned 19 yards to Rams 30-yard line, setting up Atkinson's 20-yard field goal. Hill's fumble was confirmed by a replay review that lasted nearly five minutes, prompting Redskins safety Curtis Jordan to declare \"I thought they were trying to get in touch with Oliver North.\" This was the first time in NFL postseason history a replay was used to confirm a field call of a fumble.\nAtkinson made two more field goals in the second half. The Rams' lone score of the game was Everett's 12-yard touchdown pass to House during the final quarter at the end of a 96-yard drive that was set up by Dickerson's 65-yard run. It seemed that Dickerson was headed for the end zone but he was caught from behind by Redskins defensive back Darrell Green. Later on, the Rams had a chance to score again, but Dickerson lost his third fumble of the day, this one while trying to convert a fourth and 1 on the Redskins 39.\nRedskins running back George Rogers finished the game with 119 rushing yards, while Dickerson rushed for 158. Atkinson, who had been signed by Washington a few weeks before this game and had not kicked any field goals in over a year, set a postseason franchise record with four field goals.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Rams and Redskins. Los Angeles had won two of the prior three meetings.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 3, 1987.\nAFC: Cleveland Browns 23, New York Jets 20 (2OT).\nThirty-eight-year-old Browns kicker Mark Moseley, a former Washington Redskin whom Cleveland had talked out of retirement in order to replace the injured Matt Bahr less than two months earlier, made the game-winning 27-yard field goal after 2:02 elapsed of the second overtime period, making this the third longest game in NFL history and giving Cleveland their first postseason win since 1969.\nAfter Mosely missed a 46-yard field goal attempt on Cleveland's opening possession, the Jets scored first on their third drive of the game with an 82-yard drive. Quarterback Pat Ryan started it off with a 28-yard completion to Al Toon and finished it with a 42-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wesley Walker on a flea flicker play. Cleveland responded with Kosar completing passes to Ozzie Newsome for gains of 21 and 23 yards as he led the team 98 yards to score on his 37-yard completion to running back Herman Fontenot. Midway through the second quarter, Jeff Gossett's 39-yard punt pinned New York back on their own 4-yard line. The Jets were unable to get a first down with their drive, and to make matters worse, a 3rd down sack on Ryan by a gang of Browns defenders knocked him out of the game. New York's punt gave Cleveland on the ball at midfield, and they were able to take advantage of the field position, as Kosar's 25-yard completion to fullback Kevin Mack set up a 38-yard Mosely field goal that gave the Browns a 10–7 lead. The Jets, now led by Ken O'Brien, responded with less than two minutes left in the half on a last-second field goal drive to tie the game, featuring his season-long 16-yard run on fourth down and four to keep the drive alive.\nCleveland had to punt on the opening drive of the third quarter, and Kurt Sohn gave the Jets great field position with a 9-yard return to the Browns 41-yard line. New York then drove to a 37-yard Pat Leahy field goal to break the tie. Cleveland responded with a drive to the Jets 26-yard line, but it ended with no points on another missed field goal attempt by Moseley. Early in the fourth quarter, the Browns drove all the way to the New York 3-yard line, only to come up empty when Russell Carter intercepted a pass from Kosar in the end zone. Then after a punt, Kosar's next pass attempt was intercepted again, this time by Jerry Holmes, which set up Freeman McNeil's 25-yard touchdown run on the next play to give his team a 20–10 lead with 4:14 left in regulation. This led Jets announcer Charley Steiner to prematurely declare, \"The Jets are gonna win this football game!\"\nBut the Browns then drove 68-yards to score on Mack's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:57 left on the clock, on a drive that was aided by a roughing the passer penalty on Mark Gastineau that nullified an incompletion on second down and 24 from Cleveland's 18-yard line. After a failed onside kick attempt, the Browns stopped New York on two consecutive runs and then sacked O'Brien on a quarterback draw, bringing up 4th down on the Browns 48-yard line. Then they got another lucky break when a punt that would have pinned them inside their own 10-yard line was called back by a Jets holding penalty. On the second punt, Gerald McNeil returned the ball 10 yards to the Browns 32 with 53 seconds on the clock and no timeouts left. Following a 26-yard pass interference penalty on Carl Howard, Kosar completed a 37-yard pass to wide receiver Webster Slaughter on the Jets 5-yard line with 37 seconds to go. However, the Browns hurt themselves with excessive celebration after the catch, costing them several seconds before Kosar could break them up and get his team back to the line of scrimmage. The clock ran down to 15 seconds before the next snap, in which Kosar threw a pass that was broken up and nearly intercepted by Carter. Now with 11 seconds and no timeouts remaining, the Browns decided to play for overtime and had Moseley kick a game-tying 22-yard field goal.\nAfter forcing the Jets to punt on the opening drive of overtime, Cleveland had a great chance to win after Kosar's 35-yard completion to Reggie Langhorne landed them at the Jets 5-yard line. They attempted a field goal on first down, but Moseley missed the 23-yard attempt. Still their defense continued to hold down New York, forcing them to punt on two more possessions. After the first punt, disaster nearly struck Cleveland when Mack fumbled the ball near his own 40-yard line, but Browns guard Paul Farren recovered it. With 2:38 left in the first overtime period, Cleveland got the ball on their own 31 following Dave Jennings' playoff record 14th punt of the game. After moving the ball to the Jets 42, receiver Brian Brennan made a key play when he broke up an errant pass that was nearly intercepted by Lester Lyles. This turned out to be crucial as the Browns running game would go on to take total control of the drive. First, Fontenot rushed for seven yards and then Mack added 26 yards on his next three carries, moving the ball to the 9-yard line to set up Moseley's second game-winning field goal attempt. This time, his kick was good, winning the game for the Browns after 17:02 of overtime play on an 11-play, 59-yard drive.\nKosar set postseason records for completions (33), attempts (64), and passing yards (483), but threw only one touchdown pass and two interceptions. Newsome caught six passes for 114 yards. Mack rushed 20 times for 63 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 5 passes for 51 yards. Toon was the Jets leading receiver with 5 receptions for 93 yards. The Browns tied a playoff record by recording nine sacks in the game, three by defensive tackle Carl Hairston. Cleveland finished the game with 558 yards of total offense. 45 of the Browns' 75 rushing yards in the game were gained on their final drive.\nThe game was featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as the Marathon by the Lake.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Jets and Browns.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 27, Chicago Bears 13.\nThe Redskins converted two turnovers into two touchdowns in the second half to overcome the defending champion Bears' 13–7 halftime lead. Chicago finished the game with just 220 yards and 14 first downs, while losing four turnovers.\nChicago had a chance to score early when Dennis Gentry returned the opening kickoff 60 yards to the Redskins' 35-yard line. But after a three-minute drive, the Bears ended up netting just three yards due to penalties and Kevin Butler missed a 49-yard field goal attempt on the last play. Later in the quarter, Washington took a 7–0 lead by driving 69 yards to score on Jay Schroeder's 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Art Monk. Chicago countered with 10:07 remaining in the second quarter on wide receiver Willie Gault's 50-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Doug Flutie. On the Redskins' next possession, Mike Richardson intercepted a pass from Schroeder and returned it 43 yards to the Washington 4-yard line. Still, the Bears could not get into the end zone and settled for a 10–7 lead with Butler's 23-yard field goal. Shortly before halftime, Butler made a 41-yard field goal to extend Chicago's lead to 13–7. The Redskins, thanks to a Vernon Dean interception of a tipped Doug Flutie pass, moved into position for a field goal late in the half, but Steve Cox's last second 50-yard field goal attempt came up short.\nHowever, the Redskins took over the game in the second half. In the third quarter, defensive back Darrell Green returned an interception from Flutie 17 yards to the Bears 26-yard line that set up Schroeder's 23-yard touchdown pass to Monk. Chicago seemed primed to respond when Gentry returned their kickoff 48 yards to the Redskins 42, but after advancing to the Washington 17-yard line, running back Walter Payton lost a fumble due to a hit by defensive tackle Darryl Grant, and safety Alvin Walton recovered the ball. Washington then drove 83 yards, aided by a 17-yard pass interference penalty against Richardson in the end zone, for a touchdown on a George Rogers one-yard run less than a minute into the fourth quarter. Washington place kicker Jess Atkinson made two field goals in the final quarter to close out the scoring, the second one set up by Lew Barnes' muffed punt return that was recovered by Eric Yarber.\nIn only his second NFL start, Flutie was mauled by the Redskins' defense, completing only 11 of 31 passes, with five completions in the second half. Payton was held to 38 rushing yards on 14 carries. Gentry returned three kickoffs for 127 yards.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Redskins and Bears. Chicago previously won three of the five meetings coming in.\nSunday, January 4, 1987.\nNFC: New York Giants 49, San Francisco 49ers 3.\nNY Giants quarterback Phil Simms completed only nine of 19 passes for 134 yards, but threw four touchdowns and no interceptions and sat out the fourth quarter while the New York defense allowed only 29 rushing yards, 184 total yards, and a field goal. They also forced four turnovers.\nOn the 49ers' first drive of the game, wide receiver Jerry Rice caught a very long pass from quarterback Joe Montana and appeared to be on his way for a 50-yard touchdown; however, the future Hall of Famer inexplicably fumbled the football into the Giants end zone without being touched; (John Madden said during the telecast that the artificial turf at Giants Stadium may have been a factor.) Giants safety Kenny Hill recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. New York then drove 80 yards in 10 plays to score on Simms' 24-yard touchdown to tight end Mark Bavaro. San Francisco responded with a 26-yard field goal by Ray Wersching, but in the second quarter, Giants safety Herb Welch intercepted a pass from Montana and lateralled the ball to Elvis Patterson, who ran for 16 yards before being tackled. New York then converted with the turnover into a touchdown on Joe Morris' 45-yard run.\nOn the Giants next possession, they scored on a 12-play, 57-yard drive in which they burned the 49ers with a fake field goal, starting out in normal kicking formation before switching into a shotgun formation with holder Jeff Rutledge as the quarterback. San Francisco's field goal blocking unit was caught without enough defensive backs on the field and Rutledge ended up throwing the ball to a wide open Bavaro for a 23-yard gain on the 49ers 5-yard line. A penalty pushed them back 10 yards, but New York still scored on third down with Simms' 15-yard pass to receiver Bobby Johnson. The situation only got worse for San Francisco from there, as Montana was knocked out of the game due to a hit by nose tackle Jim Burt, while linebacker Lawrence Taylor intercepted his pass and returned it 34 yards for a touchdown, giving the Giants a 28–3 halftime lead.\nSimms threw two third quarter touchdown passes, a 28-yard completion to Phil McConkey and a 29-yarder to tight end Zeke Mowatt. Near the end of the quarter, New York linebacker Pepper Johnson intercepted backup quarterback Jeff Kemp's pass and returned the ball 27 yards to the 49ers 5-yard line, setting up the final score of the game on Morris' 2-yard run with 16 seconds left in the third quarter.\nAfter the game when 49er head coach Bill Walsh was asked if Rice's fumble made a difference in the outcome of the game, Walsh replied sarcastically, \"Yeah, [that play] did. If it weren't for the fumble, the final score would have been 49 to 10.\"\nMorris finished the game with 24 carries for 159 yards and two touchdowns, along with one receptions for two yards.\nThis was fourth postseason meeting between the 49ers and Giants. San Francisco took two of the previous three meetings.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 22, New England Patriots 17.\nBroncos quarterback John Elway ran for a touchdown and passed for another one as he led Denver to a victory, while running back Sammy Winder rushed for 102 yards and caught a pass for 16. Although New England won the turnover battle (2–0), they were outgained by Denver in total yards 441 to 271, while their quarterback Tony Eason was sacked six times.\nIn the first quarter, Elway's completions to Steve Sewell and Steve Watson for gains of 39 and 21 yards propelled the team on a drive to the Patriots 4-yard line. From there, Elway tried to run the ball for a score, but was tackled just short of the end zone. Believing he had crossed the plain, Elway angrily spiked the ball into the ground, drawing a penalty that pushed the team back five yards and they ended up having to settle for Rich Karlis' field goal to go up 3–0. In the second quarter, the Patriots took the lead when Eason completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Stanley Morgan to cap an 87-yard drive. However, the Broncos countered with an 82-yard drive to score on Elway's 22-yard touchdown run. Later in the second quarter, New England linebacker Johnny Rembert's interception of an Elway pass on the Broncos 29-yard line led to Tony Franklin's 38-yard field goal, tying the game at 10 by the end of the half.\nIn the third quarter, Denver drove 80 yards in 15 plays on a drive that consumed more than nine minutes and ended with Karlis' 22-yard field goal to give them a 13–10 lead. The Patriots responded with a trick play, a flea flicker that involved fullback Mosi Tatupu taking a handoff and then pitching the ball back to Eason, who threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Morgan to retake the lead, 17–13. But Elway then threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vance Johnson for the go-ahead score on the last play of the third quarter, giving the team a 20–17 lead.\nNew England had four possessions in the fourth quarter, but the first three ended in punts, while Broncos defensive end Rulon Jones ended the last one by sacking Eason in the end zone for a safety with 1:32 left in the game.\nElway had a rough day in the winning effort, completing only 13 of 32 passes for 257 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions. Eason completed 13/24 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 23 yards. His top target was Morgan, who caught three passes for 100 yards and two scores. Broncos punter Mike Horan averaged 49 yards per kick on his five punts, and placed three of them in the 20, including the final one that set up Jones' game-clinching safety.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Patriots and Broncos.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 11, 1987.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 23, Cleveland Browns 20 (OT).\nThis game is best remembered for The Drive in Cleveland and Denver sports lore when the Broncos drove 98 yards in 15 plays to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation and Denver kicker Rich Karlis kicked the game-winning 33-yard field goal 5:38 into overtime.\nThe Browns scored first when quarterback Bernie Kosar threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Herman Fontenot at the end of an 86-yard drive. But then Cleveland turned the ball over on three consecutive drives. First Ricky Hunley intercepted Kosar's pass on the last play of the first quarter. Then after a punt, linebacker Jim Ryan picked off a Kosar pass and returned it 21 yards to the Browns 9-yard line. Denver then drove to the 1-yard line, but were halted there and decided to settle for Rich Karlis' 19-yard field goal. After the ensuing kickoff, running back Kevin Mack lost a fumble that was recovered by Ken Woodard on the Cleveland 37. On the next play, Denver quarterback John Elway's 34-yard scramble moved the ball to the 4-yard line. Once again, they ended up facing fourth down on the 1-yard line, but this time they decided to go for the touchdown and Gerald Willhite scored on a sweep right. Cleveland managed to respond with Kosar's 42-yard completion to receiver Clarence Weathers, setting up Mark Moseley's 29-yard field goal to tie the score at 10 with less than a minute left in the half.\nIn the second half, Elway threw his first interception of the game, a pass that was picked off near the sidelines by rookie Mark Harper. But the Broncos defense rose to the occasion and managed to force a punt. Elway then led Denver inside the Browns 20-yard line where Karlis made a 26-yard field goal to break the tie with 2:50 left in the third quarter.\nCleveland responded with a field goal of their own, a 24-yarder from Moseley to tie the game at 13. Then after a punt, Kosar completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Brian Brennan, making the score 20–13 with 5:43 left in regulation. On the ensuing kickoff, returner Ken Bell misplayed the kick and it hit the ground in front of him, bouncing to the 2-yard line before he managed to dive on the ball. Elway then led his team 98 yards to tie the game on wide receiver Mark Jackson's 5-yard touchdown reception with 37 seconds left in regulation. Jackson also made a big play earlier on the drive, catching a 20-yard pass from Elway on third down and 18 from the Browns 48-yard line with 1:47 to go. Overall, the drive covered 98 yards in 15 plays without ever facing a fourth down, and only facing a third down three times.\nAfter forcing Cleveland to punt on the opening drive of overtime, Elway led the Broncos 60 yards to set up Karlis' game winning 33-yard field goal. The key play of the drive was a 28-yard completion to Steve Watson on third down and 12 at midfield. Two carries by Sammy Winder then moved the ball to the 16-yard line where Karlis made his game winning kick, which barely made it inside the left upright.\nThis game was later featured on NFL's Greatest Games.\nUntil the 2018 season, this was the only AFC Championship Game to go to overtime.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Broncos and Browns.\nNFC: New York Giants 17, Washington Redskins 0.\nThe Giants shut out the Redskins, allowing only 150 passing yards and 40 rushing yards. New York won the coin toss. With the winds at Giants Stadium blowing at 32 miles per hour, the Giants chose to defend one end of the field. While this meant that Washington would receive both the opening and second half kickoffs, the Giants were able to avoid kicking into the wind for the first and third quarters.\nAfter the Redskins were forced to punt on their opening possession, punter Steve Cox could only manage to kick the ball in the strong wind 23 yards to the Washington 47-yard line. Six plays and 17 yards later, the Giants scored on Raúl Allegre's 47-yard field goal, his longest of the season after joining the team in week 4. After the ensuing kickoff, the Redskins were forced to punt again and Cox managed to only punt the ball 27 yards to the Washington 38-yard line. From there, New York advanced to the Redskins 26. On third down and 10, quarterback Phil Simms threw an incomplete pass and center Bart Oates was called for holding. Rather than take the incompletion to bring up fourth down, Redskins coach Joe Gibbs accepted the holding penalty, hoping to push and keep the Giants out of field goal range. But on the next play, Simms completed a 25-yard pass to Lionel Manuel for a first down. A few plays later, Simms finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Manuel on third down and goal.\nWashington's best chance to score came in the second quarter, when a 48-yard reception by receiver Art Monk set up a field goal attempt, but it never got off the ground because quarterback Jay Schroeder fumbled the snap. On their next drive, Simms completed a 30-yard pass to tight end Mark Bavaro and later rushed eight yards to the Redskins 1-yard line on a quarterback bootleg. On the next play, running back Joe Morris completed the 51-yard drive by taking it into the end zone from there. Just before halftime, Morris gave the Redskins a scoring opportunity by losing a fumble deep in New York territory. But Washington came up empty when \"The Big Blue Wrecking Crew\" stopped them on a fourth and 1 conversion attempt.\nIn the second half, Washington completely abandoned their running game, passing the ball on all but one of their plays, but to no avail. By the end of the game, Schroeder was sacked four times, intercepted once by linebacker Gary Reasons and finished with just 20 of 50 completions for 195 yards.\nWashington's lone bright spot of the day was Monk, who caught eight passes for 126 yards.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Redskins and Giants. Washington won the only previous meeting.\nSuper Bowl XXI: New York Giants 39, Denver Broncos 20.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Broncos and Giants."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1985 season began on December 28, 1985. The postseason tournament concluded with the Chicago Bears defeating the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX, 46–10, on January 26, 1986, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nSchedule.\nBecause the Jets and Giants both used Giants Stadium as their home field, the two wild card playoff games were held on different days.\nIn the United States, CBS televised the NFC playoff games, while NBC broadcast the AFC games and Super Bowl XX.\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 28, 1985.\nAFC: New England Patriots 26, New York Jets 14.\nIn the NFL's first playoff game at Giants Stadium, the Patriots dominated the game by forcing five sacks and four turnovers from a Jets offense that had ranked #1 during the season for fewest turnovers lost (29). This was New England's first playoff win since 1963.\nNew England jumped to 3–0 lead in the first quarter after Tony Franklin made a 33-yard field goal. Then after New York scored on quarterback Ken O'Brien's 11-yard touchdown pass to running back Johnny Hector, Franklin kicked his second field goal from 41 yards. Late in the second quarter, safety Fred Marion intercepted a pass from O'Brien and returned it 26 yards to the Jets 33-yard line. A few plays later, Jets defensive back Russell Carter failed to make contact with receiver Stanley Morgan while trying to jam him at the line of scrimmage, enabling Morgan to take off past Carter and haul in a 36-yard touchdown completion from Tony Eason, giving New England a 13–7 halftime lead.\nIn the third quarter, Franklin made a 20-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 16–7 lead and on the ensuing kickoff, Hector was stripped of the ball by linebacker Johnny Rembert, who then picked up the fumble and returned it 15 yards for a touchdown, which gave the Patriots a commanding 23–7 lead. However, Hector returned the next kickoff 33 yards to the Pats 43-yard line. From there, Pat Ryan replaced O'Brien, who had been suffering from a concussion since the first half, and completed 5/7 passes on a 57-yard scoring drive, the last a 12-yard touchdown throw to tight end Mickey Shuler, making the score 23–14. But in the fourth quarter, Patriots linebacker Andre Tippett deflected a Ryan pass into the arms of defensive end Garin Veris, who returned the interception 18 yards to set up Franklin's fourth field goal and finish off the scoring.\nVeris finished the game with three sacks and an interception. Eason completed 12 of 17 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown. Hector returned six kickoffs for 115 yards and added 24 more yards rushing and receiving. Jets receiver Al Toon set a franchise playoff record for receptions (9), good for 93 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Patriots and Jets.\nSunday, December 29, 1985.\nNFC: New York Giants 17, San Francisco 49ers 3.\nIn the Giants first home playoff game since 1962, despite the fact that the 49ers recorded 362 yards of total offense, with receiver Dwight Clark catching eight passes for 120 yards, the Giants defense limited San Francisco to only one field goal the entire game. It was a very satisfying win for New York, who had lost their last five games played against the 49ers, including playoff losses in 1981 and 1984. Meanwhile, the 49ers dropped nine passes and finished without a touchdown for the first time in their last 40 games.\nThe Giants scored on their opening possession of the game with kicker Eric Schubert's 47-yard field goal. Then in the second quarter, New York safety Terry Kinard intercepted a pass from 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and returned it 15 yards to set up Phil Simms' 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mark Bavaro. San Francisco managed to drive inside the Giants 10-yard line with a 15-play drive that included two personal fouls and a holding call against New York's defense. However, they could not get into the end zone and had to settle for Ray Wersching's 21-yard field goal, cutting the score to 10-3 going into halftime.\nA 77-yard drive in the third quarter was capped by Simms' 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Don Hasselbeck, increasing New York's lead to 17–3. In the fourth quarter, the Giants made two key defensive stands to keep the game out of range. First, they forced San Francisco to turn the ball over on downs at the New York 26 with 4:46 left. Following a New York punt, the 49ers drove into the Giants red zone. With 2:16 left in the game, Montana threw a touchdown pass to tight end John Frank, but it was eliminated by a holding penalty against guard John Ayers. On the next play, he threw a pass to running back Carl Monroe, only to have him drop it in the end zone. Then on fourth and 15, Montana's final pass was incomplete and New York ran out the rest of the clock.\nNew York running back Joe Morris finished the game with 141 rushing yards. Defensive lineman Jim Burt had two of New York's four sacks. 49ers running back Roger Craig, who became the first player in NFL history to gain over 1,000 rushing and receiving yards during the regular season, was held to just 24 rushing yards and 18 receiving yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the 49ers and Giants. San Francisco won both previous meetings.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 4, 1986.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 24, Cleveland Browns 21.\nBarely making the playoffs with an 8–8 record, Cleveland hardly seemed a match for the 12–4 defending AFC champion Dolphins. However, the Browns jumped to a 21–3 lead midway through the third quarter, but the Dolphins then scored 21 unanswered points—the final touchdown with 1:57 left to play.\nAided by a 17-yard run from Woody Bennett on the first play of the game, Miami scored on their opening drive with a 51-yard field goal by Fuad Reveiz. Cleveland later marched 82 yards in 10 plays, mainly on the strength of their ground game, with Kevin Mack rushing for 12, Curtis Dickey picking up 9, and Earnest Byner's 15-yard carry taking them into the red zone. Bernie Kosar eventually finished the drive with a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ozzie Newsome to give the Browns a 7–3 lead.\nIn the second quarter, Miami got two big chances to score, but came up empty both times. First, they threatened to score with a drive to a first down on the Cleveland 36-yard line. But the Browns defense stepped up, forcing two incompletions and a run for no gain, and the Dolphins decided to punt rather than risk another long field goal. On the Browns next drive, Paul Lankford intercepted Kosar and returned the ball to the Cleveland 25-yard line. Miami then drove to the 6-yard line, only to lose the ball when Marino was picked off in the end zone by Browns safety Don Rogers, who returned it 45 yards to set up a 21-yard rushing touchdown from Byner, increasing the lead to 14–3. Miami responded with a drive to the Browns 29-yard line, but Reveiz missed a 47-yard field goal attempt as time expired in the half.\nByner ran for a 66-yard touchdown with 11:03 left in the third quarter, the longest play in Cleveland's postseason history, to give Cleveland a 21–3 lead. However, Miami then controlled the rest of the game. A 13-play 74-yard drive, aided by a 15-yard late hit penalty against Cleveland and a 15-yard reception by Mark Clayton, was capped by Marino's 6-yard touchdown pass to Nat Moore. Miami's defense quickly forced a punt, and Jeff Gossett's kick went just 26 yards to the Browns 49-yard line. From there it took just five plays to score on a 31-yard burst by Ron Davenport, who trucked right through Rogers and linebacker Clarence Weathers on the way to the end zone. Browns receiver Glen Young gave his team a chance to get their momentum back with a 35-yard kickoff return to the 42-yard line. But after a holding penalty wiped out a first down run, Cleveland could not recover and had to punt.\nIn the fourth quarter, Marino got the team rolling on a 74-yard, 10-play drive for the game winning score, connecting with halfback Tony Nathan for a 39-yard gain (the longest reception of the day from either team) to the Browns 35-yard line, and later finding tight end Bruce Hardy for 18 yards inside the Cleveland red zone. On the first play after the two-minute warning, Davenport went into the end zone on a 1-yard score with 1:57 left to give the Dolphins the lead, 24–21. Cleveland then took the ball and tried to drive for the tying field goal, but on the game's last play, Byner was tackled on the Miami 45-yard line as time expired.\nByner finished the game with 161 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just 16 carries, while also catching four passes for 25 yards. Nathan rushed for 21 yards and caught 10 passes for 101 yards. Marino was 25/45 for 238 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Cleveland racked up a whopping 251 rushing yards against the Dolphins defense, which turned out to be an omen of what lay in store for them in the AFC Championship Game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Browns and Dolphins. Miami won the only previous meeting.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 20, Dallas Cowboys 0.\nRunning back Eric Dickerson led the Rams to a victory by scoring two touchdowns and recording a playoff record 248 rushing yards, while LA's defense held the Cowboys to 243 yards and forced six turnovers.\nRams receiver Henry Ellard's 23-yard punt return to the Dallas 38-yard line and 21-yard reception on the next play set up the first score of the game, a 33-yard field goal by Mike Lansford 5:19 into the first quarter. This ended up being the only score of the first half, while Ellard's 21-yard catch ended up being nearly half of the Rams total passing yards (47) for the entire game.\nLA running back Charles White returned the second half kickoff (a squib kick by punter Mike Saxon, who had replaced injured kicker Rafael Septién) 14 yards to the Rams 45-yard line. Dickerson scored on a 55-yard touchdown run on the next play, giving the Rams a 10–0 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Kenny Duckett fumbled, and the ball was recovered by Vince Newsome on the Dallas 18 to set up Lansford's second field goal. In the fourth quarter, Dallas managed to reach the Rams 20-yard line, but Kevin Greene sacked Cowboys quarterback Danny White on third down. Now on 4th and 14 from the Rams 24 and without their injured kicker, the Cowboys seemed unsure of what to do. First they sent their field goal unit in, with linebacker Brian Salonen, who played kicker in college, lined up to make the kick. This caused the Rams to sense a potential fake try, so they kept their regular defense on the field. Then Dallas called a timeout and sent their regular offense back to try and convert the fourth down, which failed as White's pass was batted away. The Cowboys defense subsequently forced a punt, but Gordon Banks muffed the kick and Rams cornerback Jerry Gray recovered the ball to set up Dickerson's 40-yard rushing touchdown.\nThis was Tom Landry's final postseason game as the Cowboys head coach, and also the final NFL playoff game at Anaheim Stadium. The Rams would not host another NFL postseason game until 1999, the team's fifth season following their 1995 relocation to St. Louis. The Rams would not host another playoff game as the Los Angeles Rams until 2017. It would be their record breaking eighth playoff meeting between the two teams and the last one until the 2018 season. Rams defensive end Gary Jeter finished the game with three sacks, while Gray had a fumble recovery and an interception. The Rams won despite a dismal day for their 34-year old rookie quarterback Dieter Brock, who completed just 6 of 22 passes for 50 yards and was intercepted once.\n\"It seemed like we just gave up,\" said Dallas future hall of fame running back Tony Dorsett, who was held to just 58 rushing yards, though he did catch 8 passes for 80. \"We should have gone back to Dallas and gave them the ball game at halftime.\" \"As far as playoff games go, I don't think we've ever been dominated like we were today,\" added White, who was sacked five times and threw three interceptions.\nThis was the eighth postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Rams. Dallas had won four of the previous seven meetings.\nJanuary 5, 1986.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 21, New York Giants 0.\nThe Bears defense dominated the game by allowing only 32 rushing yards, 181 total yards, and sacking the Giants quarterbacks for 60 yards. Giants quarterback Phil Simms was sacked six times during the game, 3.5 of them coming from Chicago defensive end Richard Dent. New York's offense passed for just 104 yards in the first half, and had 89 total yards in the third quarter.\nChicago's first touchdown resulted on a New York punt attempt from their own 12, forcing Sean Landeta to attempt the kick three yards behind his goal line. As Landeta dropped the ball to kick it, the wind altered the ball's descent and caused it to go off the side of his foot. As a result, the ball went right into the ground and bounced a short distance before reserve safety Shaun Gayle picked it up and returned the -7 yard punt five yards for a touchdown. Gayle's run was the shortest punt return touchdown in NFL history.\nNew York had their best chance to score late in the second quarter when Simms completed passes to George Adams and Bobby Johnson for gains of 31 and 17 yards, giving the team a first down on the Chicago 2-yard line. But Simms' next three passes were incomplete, and with just 11 seconds left in the half, kicker Eric Schubert hit the left upright on his 19-yard field goal attempt.\nIn the third quarter, Bears quarterback Jim McMahon increased the Bears lead to 14–0 with a 23-yard touchdown pass to receiver Dennis McKinnon. Later in the quarter, with Chicago facing second and 12 on their own 34, the Giants made another key error. The Giants defense came out of the huddle planning for a massive blitz, but decided to switch to a zone defense after reading the Bears formation. However, half the defenders were unable to hear the new play call over the roaring crowd at Soldier Field and ended up blitzing, leaving receiver Tim Wrightman completely uncovered. McMahon threw the ball to Wrightman for a 46-yard gain, and then finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to McKinnon on the next play, making the final score of the game 21–0. The Bears could have had a much larger lead, but the normally reliable rookie kicker Kevin Butler had an uncharacteristically bad day, missing three field goal attempts from distances of 26, 49 and 38 yards.\nMcMahon finished the game with 216 passing yards, while running back Walter Payton rushed for 94 yards and caught a 4-yard pass.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Giants and Bears. Chicago won four of the previous six meetings.\nAFC: New England Patriots 27, Los Angeles Raiders 20.\nLA had defeated New England 35–20 during the regular season, but in this game, Patriots running back Craig James rushed for 104 yards, caught three passes for 48 yards, completed one pass for eight yards, and scored a touchdown while the Patriots defense forced six turnovers and shut out the Raiders in the second half.\nIn the first quarter, Patriots safety Jim Bowman recovered a muffed punt by returner Fulton Walker to set up Tony Eason's 13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Lin Dawson. On LA's next drive, Ronnie Lippett intercepted a pass from Marc Wilson, but the Patriots were unable to move the ball. Then Raiders defensive end Greg Townsend blocked Rich Camarillo's punt, getting the ball back for his team at the Pats 16-yard line and leading to a 29-yard field goal by Chris Bahr.\nIn the second quarter, Bahr missed a 44-yard field goal, but their defense once again held the Patriots down and forced a punt, which Walker returned 16 yards to start off a 52-yard scoring drive culminating in Wilson's 16-yard touchdown throw to receiver Jessie Hester. On New England's first play from scrimmage after the turnover, Raiders lineman Howie Long recovered Mosi Tatupu's fumble on the New England 19, and LA scored another touchdown on Marcus Allen's 11-yard run, increasing their lead to 17–7. The Patriots stormed back with an 80-yard touchdown possession. Tatupu helped make up for his fumble with a 22-yard run, while James caught a 24-yard reception and rushed for 27 yards on the drive, including a 2-yard touchdown on third down out of shotgun formation that cut the score to 17–14. Then on LA's ensuing possession, Lippett recorded his second interception of the day, giving the Patriots the ball at LA's 28-yard line and setting up a Tony Franklin field goal to tie the game. There was just 1:40 left in the half at this point, but the Raiders still managed to retake the lead before halftime, with Allen rushing for a 17-yard gain and Wilson completing a 31-yard pass to tight end Todd Christensen on the way to a 32-yard field goal from Bahr.\nMidway through the third quarter, Allen lost a fumble that led to Franklin's field goal, tying the game back up at 20. Then in what turned out to be the key play of the game, Raiders cornerback Sam Seale fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Bowman recovered in the end zone for a touchdown to give his team a 27–20 lead. There was still a full quarter left to play, but the Raiders would get no further in the game than the New England 41-yard line. Los Angeles' three fourth quarter drives would result in a punt, an interception by Fred Marion and a turnover on downs at their own 13.\nAllen finished the game with 121 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with three receptions for eight yards.\nThis was the last victory by a road team in an AFC divisional playoff game until 1992, when the Buffalo Bills defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Patriots and Raiders. The Raiders won the only previous meeting when they were based in Oakland.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 12, 1986.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 24, Los Angeles Rams 0.\nThe Bears defense dominated the game by limiting Rams running back Eric Dickerson to 46 yards, forcing him to fumble twice, and holding quarterback Dieter Brock to just 10 completions on 31 attempts for 66 yards. While Chicago's offensive numbers were hardly stellar (232 yards and 10 punts), Los Angeles only gained 130 yards of total offense and had to punt the ball 11 times.\nAfter forcing the Rams to go three-and-out on the game's first possession, Bears quarterback Jim McMahon threw consecutive 20-yard completions to tight end Emery Moorehead and receiver Willie Gault before finishing the drive with a 16-yard touchdown run on third down and 10. Kevin Butler added a 34-yard field goal to give the Bears a 10-0 first quarter lead. With 1:04 left in the second quarter, LA had a huge opportunity to get back in the game when Dale Hatcher's punt bounced into the leg of Bears defensive back Reggie Phillips and safety Jerry Gray recovered the ball for the Rams on Chicago's 21-yard line. Dickerson rushed twice for nine yards and caught a pass for 7, but on his reception he was tackled on the 5 as time expired in the half. \"We did call time out right before the half\", John Robinson, the Rams' coach, insisted. \"It depends on how long the ref takes to recognize that a player has called a timeout.\"\nThe Rams drove to their own 47-yard line on their first drive of the second half, but then linebacker Otis Wilson forced a fumble from Dickerson that was recovered by Mike Richardson on the Bears 48. Faced with fourth down and 6 on the Rams 35-yard line on the ensuing drive, Chicago picked up a first down with McMahon's 13-yard completion to running back Walter Payton. Then they took a 17–0 lead with McMahon's 22-yard touchdown pass to Gault on the next play. LA responded with a drive into Chicago territory, but Leslie Frazier ended it with an interception.\nWith 2:37 left in the fourth quarter, Dent forced Brock to fumble while sacking him, and linebacker Wilber Marshall picked up the loose ball and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown. It marked the end of a long day for Brock, having been sacked three times and taken numerous additional hits and harassment the entire game by the stifling Bears defense.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Rams and Bears. Los Angeles won the only prior meeting.\nAFC: New England Patriots 31, Miami Dolphins 14.\nIn an upset, the Patriots racked up 255 rushing yards and converted six Dolphins turnovers into 24 points.\nOn Miami's first offensive play, Steve Nelson stripped the ball from running back Tony Nathan, and Patriots defensive end Garin Veris recovered it to set up Tony Franklin's 23-yard field goal. The Dolphins later scored on an 80-yard drive, with quarterback Dan Marino completing passes to Bruce Hardy for 12 yards and Mark Duper for 18 before finding tight end Dan Johnson in the end zone with an 11-yard touchdown pass. But New England responded on a 66-yard possession, featuring a 45-yard run from Robert Weathers, to score on quarterback Tony Eason's 4-yard touchdown to Tony Collins, giving the Pats a 10–7 lead. On Miami's next drive, Marino fumbled the ball and nose tackle Lester Williams recovered for New England on the Dolphins 36-yard line. Patriots running back Craig James then rushed for 23 yards on three carries and Eason completed a 12-yard pass to Stanley Morgan on the 1-yard line before throwing a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Derrick Ramsey, giving the Patriots a 17–7 lead. Just before halftime Miami missed the chance to cut the deficit down to three points when tight end Dan Johnson dropped a pass from Marino in the end zone on a first and 10 from the Patriots' 16. As the next two plays fell short of a first down, Miami settled for a field goal from the Patriots' 14 yard-line, but Fuad Reveiz' kick sailed wide to the right after a badly taken snap.\nMiami's Lorenzo Hampton then lost a fumble on the second half kickoff on a hit from Mosi Tatupu, and Greg Hawthorne recovered for New England on the Dolphins 25. Eason then converted the turnover into points at the end of a 6-play drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Weathers, making the score 24–7. The Dolphins had a chance to take the momentum back when safety Bud Brown recovered Fred Marion's fumbled punt return on the Patriots 45-yard line. But after a 19-yard run by Joe Carter and a 16-yard catch by Ron Davenport, Marion made up for his error by intercepting Marino's pass in the end zone to keep Miami from scoring. New England then put together a 13-play drive that took nearly eight minutes off the clock and moved the ball to the Dolphins 24-yard line. But Franklin missed a 41-yard field goal attempt, keeping the Dolphins' slim comeback hopes alive going into the fourth quarter.\nThree plays into the final quarter, New England fumbled another punt return, this one lost by Roland James, and Miami took over on the Patriots 10-yard line. This time, they took advantage of their scoring opportunity with Marino's 10-yard touchdown pass to Tony Nathan on the next play, cutting their deficit to 24–14. Things looked even more promising for the Dolphins when they forced a punt and drove to the New England 38-yard line. But then Carter fumbled the ball and defensive end Julius Adams picked it up for the Patriots fourth fumble recovery of the day. New England then put the game away with a 9-play drive, featuring a 14-yard run by Tony Collins and a 13-yard carry by James. Tatupu later finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, putting the score out of reach at 31–14. With 7:34 left in the game, Miami mounted one last spirited drive, moving the ball to the NE 8-yard line. But two penalties pushed them back to the 28, and then a desperate pass from Marino was picked off by Raymond Clayborn in the end zone.\nJames was their main contributor on offense, rushing for a career postseason high 105 yards of the Patriots 255 total rushing yards in a game played in a steady rain. Of note, the Patriots ran the ball on 59 out of 71 offensive plays, amassing 255 rushing yards in an upset of the favored Dolphins. Weathers added 87 yards, while Collins rushed for 61 and caught three passes for 15. Eason threw for just 71 yards, but completed 10 of 12 passes with three touchdowns and no interceptions. The win was the first for the Patriots at the Miami Orange Bowl since 1966, the Dolphins inaugural season, ending a string of 18 consecutive losses by the Patriots in Miami and earning the Patriots their first trip to the Super Bowl in franchise history, and becoming the first to do so by winning three playoff games on the road.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Patriots and Dolphins. Miami won the only prior meeting.\nSuper Bowl XX: Chicago Bears 46, New England Patriots 10.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Bears and Patriots."

He played in Major League Baseball as a relief pitcher from to .\nEarly life.\nSantos was born in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic. His biography lists that he graduated from Passaic High School in Passaic, New Jersey in 1995, though Santos was a four-year starter on the baseball team at Saint Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 1994, he was named Most Valuable Player of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference baseball tournament, where he was the winning pitcher twice in the Peacocks' three-game sweep. Santos is the first former Peacock baseball player to reach the majors.\nProfessional career.\nSantos signed with the Detroit Tigers as a non-drafted free agent in 1995. In 2001, Santos was named Tigers Rookie of the Year. Although he allowed some unearned runs, Santos posted a 0.00 ERA over his first 27.1 innings in the majors, the longest such streak to start a career since Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1980–81 (34 innings). For his effort, he was named Detroit rookie of the year by the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association.\nSantos was traded to the Colorado Rockies for José Paniagua in 2002 and acquired by the Texas Rangers before the 2003 season. Then he signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers before being called up for the 2004 season, where he earned his way onto the starting rotation. After two years with Milwaukee, he made an unusual route via the Kansas City Royals and the Rule 5 draft onto the major-league roster of the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 2006 season.\nThe Pirates granted him free agency on October 6, 2006, immediately after the 2006 season ended. On January 8, 2007, he signed a minor league deal with the Reds. On September 7, 2007, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for cash considerations.\nSantos elected free agency on October 12, 2007. On January 11, 2008, Santos signed with the San Francisco Giants to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. He became a free agent at the end of the season. After splitting the 2009 season between the independent Newark Bears and the Vaqueros Laguna, he played with the Vaqueros again in 2010, appearing in 10 games with a 3–4 record.\nPersonal life.\nSantos has been a resident of Woodland Park, New Jersey.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "text": "David Jeffrey Bennett (born June 10, 1980) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, and Tampa Bay Rays.\nEarly life.\nJeff Bennett grew up in Brush Creek, Tennessee, and was an all-state pitcher for Gordonsville High School. He holds the school's career home run record.\nBaseball career.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nBennett was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 19th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. He played his first professional season with the Rookie Gulf Coast League Pirates in 1998. In 13 games, he compiled a 2–4 win–loss record with a 4.63 earned run average (ERA). He advanced through the Pirates' minor league system, playing as high as Triple-A with the Nashville Sounds of the Pacific Coast League in 2003.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nIn December 2003, the Milwaukee Brewers acquired Bennett in the Rule 5 draft from Pittsburgh. He made his major league debut on April 6, 2004, against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Memorial Stadium and he gave up 2 hits in 1 innings. With the Brewers, Bennett went 1–5 with a 4.79 ERA in 60 appearances. He was well known for keeping the brim of his baseball cap almost completely flat and wearing it so low that the bill was slightly above his eyes.\nHe was granted free agency following the season. Bennett missed the entire 2006 season after undergoing a successful Tommy John surgery.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn September 20, 2007, Bennett made his first career start and his first appearance with the Atlanta Braves. Against the Milwaukee Brewers, Bennett went 5 innings while striking out 8, earning the win. On September 25, Bennett earned a win in relief against the Philadelphia Phillies. He finished the season 2–1 with a 3.46 ERA.\nIn a relief appearance against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 24, 2008, Bennett recorded his first major league hit in the fifth inning against pitcher Randy Johnson.\nThe Braves suspended Bennett's pay on June 25, 2009, the day after he fractured his hand with an angry punch to a clubhouse wall. Bennett filed a grievance with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and continued his rehab assignment at Triple-A Gwinnett. The MLBPA directed the Braves to either repay the suspended funds or grant him free agency. He requested the Braves release him from his contract, and was granted his release on July 30.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nBennett signed with the Tampa Bay Rays on August 1, 2009. In eleven games, all relief appearances, Bennett had a 9.95 ERA. He appeared in three games for the Durham Bulls, the Rays' Triple-A affiliate, before being released on May 13, 2010.\nReturn to the Milwaukee Brewers.\nOn May 25, 2010, Bennett signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, and was assigned to Triple-A Nashville. He came on in relief in twelve games, and was released after the season.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn April 30, 2011, in his first outing after returning from a torn labrum, he struck out two batters in a scoreless inning for the Lancaster Barnstormers of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks and assigned to the Triple-A Reno Aces on June 15. Bennett was released on August 30.\nIndependent leagues.\nFrom late 2011 through 2013, Bennett played for a number of teams in the Mexican Pacific League, Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, Atlantic League, and Mexican League.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nBennett signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 16, 2014. He made 21 starts for the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes, compiling an 8–6 record with a 3.82 ERA. He made one start in winter ball after the season, managing only one out. After the out, he lost feeling in his pitching hand and took himself out of the game. He decided to retire from baseball the following March.\nPersonal life.\nIn early 2015, Bennett began giving baseball lessons to local youth athletes in Middle Tennessee near his home in Mt. Juliet. Initially borrowing places to train, his business soon grew large enough to necessitate owning his own facility: Jeff Bennett's Baseball Academy, near Lebanon, Tennessee.\nHe and his wife have four children."

        "title": "David Thompson (basketball)",
        "text": "David O'Neil Thompson (born July 13, 1954) is an American former professional basketball player. He played with the Denver Nuggets of both the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as the Seattle SuperSonics of the NBA. He was previously a star in college for North Carolina State, leading the Wolfpack to its first NCAA championship in 1974. Thompson is one of the ten players to score 70 or more points in an NBA game. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996.\nThompson was known for his exceptional leaping ability that enabled him to become one of the game's premier dunkers in the 1970s and earned him the nickname of \"Skywalker\". Michael Jordan said, \"The whole meaning of vertical leap began with David Thompson.\" Bill Walton described Thompson as \"Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, and LeBron James rolled into one\".\nHigh school career.\nThompson attended Crest Senior High School and he played for the school's Varsity Basketball team for four years. He starred in the North Carolina Coaches Association's East-West All-Star Basketball Game in 1971. Thompson is a first cousin of Alvin Gentry, both growing up in Shelby, North Carolina.\nCollege career.\nThompson led North Carolina State University to an undefeated season (27-0) in 1973, but the Wolfpack was banned from post-season play that year due to NCAA rules violations involving the recruiting of Thompson.\nHe then led the Wolfpack to a 30–1 season and the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship in 1974. In the semifinal game NCSU defeated the reigning national champions, UCLA, in double overtime. In the championship game they won easily over Marquette 76–64. His nickname was \"Skywalker\" because of his incredible vertical leap. The alley-oop pass, now a staple of today's high-flying, above-the-rim game, was \"invented\" by Thompson and his NC State teammate Monte Towe, and first used as an integral part of the offense by NC State coach Norm Sloan to take advantage of Thompson's leaping ability.\nNC State's game against the nationally 4th-ranked University of Maryland Terrapins in the 1974 ACC Tournament finale, in an era in which only conference champions were invited to the NCAA tournament, is considered one of the best college basketball games of all time. Thompson and teammate Tommy Burleson led the #1-ranked Wolfpack to a 103–100 win in overtime, in a game played with no shot clock and no three point field goal. Maryland shot 63% from the field for the game, and lost. Thompson and the Wolfpack would go on to win the national championship that year. Maryland's exclusion from the NCAA Tournament due to the loss, despite their high national ranking, would lead to the expansion of the NCAA Tournament the very next season to include teams other than the league champions.\nThompson is considered one of the greatest players in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference, among such talents as Michael Jordan, Ralph Sampson, Tim Duncan, Christian Laettner and Tyler Hansbrough.\nThompson played basketball while the slam dunk was outlawed from 1967 to 1977 by the \"Lew Alcindor\" rule. In 1975, playing his final home game at NC State against UNC-Charlotte, late in the second half Thompson on a breakaway received a long pass from a teammate, resulting in the first and only dunk of his collegiate career, a goal that was promptly disallowed by a technical foul.\nThompson's number 44 remains the lone number retired by the school in men's basketball.\nIn 2023, Thompson became the first player to have a statue outside Reynolds Coliseum.\nProfessional career.\nDenver Nuggets (1975–1982).\nThompson was the No. 1 draft pick of both the American Basketball Association (Virginia Squires) and the National Basketball Association (Atlanta Hawks) in the 1975 drafts of both leagues. He eventually signed with the ABA's Denver Nuggets. He finished runner-up to Julius Erving in the first-ever Slam-Dunk Competition, held at the 1976 ABA All-Star Game in Denver, but was named MVP of the ABA All-Star Game. As a prize, he received a credenza television set.\nThat season, the Nuggets finished 60–24, and beat the Kentucky Colonels in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the 1976 ABA Finals. In the finals, the Nuggets faced Erving and the New York Nets, and Thompson averaged 28.3 points and 6.3 rebounds per game in a tightly contested 4–2 series loss, including an almost-heroic 42 point effort to lead all scorers in a narrow 112-106 Game 6 loss. After the season ended, Thompson was awarded the 1976 ABA Rookie of the Year award. When Alvan Adams accepted the 1976 NBA Rookie of the Year Award, he thanked David Thompson for choosing to play in the ABA.\nOnly a few months later, the two biggest basketball leagues in the United States combined in the ABA–NBA merger, and Thompson continued with the Nuggets. He went on to make the NBA All-Star Game four times. On April 9, 1978, the last day of that year's regular season, Thompson scored 73 points against the Detroit Pistons in an effort to win the NBA scoring title, which he lost by less than 0.1 points per game to the San Antonio Spurs' George Gervin, who scored 63 points in a game played later that same day.\nAfter the 1977–78 season, Thompson signed a then-record contract extension that paid him $4 million over five years. After a foot injury caused him to miss the final 36 games of the 1979–80 season, he returned to average 25.5 points in 77 games the next year.\nSeattle SuperSonics (1982–1984).\nHowever, after he dipped to 14.9 points in 1981–82, the Nuggets traded him to the Seattle SuperSonics on June 17, 1982, for Bill Hanzlik and a draft pick.\nThompson experienced somewhat of a career revival during his first year in Seattle, making the 1982-83 All-Star game after averaging 15.9 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 3 assists, which were comparatively low totals when contrasted with the stats from his prime in Denver. During that year's playoffs, in his last postseason appearance, Thompson averaged just 12 points in a two-game series loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. The next year, Thompson missed nearly all of the 1983–84 season due to drug rehabilitation. Following his release, the Sonics resigned him for the remaining nineteen games of the 1983–84 season, in which he averaged a career low of 12.6 points before an off-court 1984 knee injury forced him into retirement.\nDrug addiction.\nThompson's substance abuse problems began due to feelings of \"loneliness and isolation\" after his 1979–80 foot injury. They first became public after his erratic debut season in Seattle, after which he checked into a Denver rehabilitation facility in 1983. His career-ending 1984 knee injury resulted from him being shoved down a stairwell during a fight at Studio 54, and later factored into his failed 1985 tryout with the Indiana Pacers, after which he was arrested that night for public intoxication. By 1986, Thompson was reportedly spending $1,000 daily on cocaine, for which he checked into rehab that year in Kirkland, Washington. After he was sentenced to 180 days in jail in 1987 for assaulting his wife, Thompson became a committed Christian and reorganized his life.\nPost-playing career.\nThompson worked with the Charlotte Hornets' community-relations department in 1990, and, at age 37, played in the Legends Classic during the 1992 NBA All-Star Weekend, but he was one of two participants (with Norm Nixon) who were taken off the court on stretchers with serious leg injuries. This resulted in the league retiring the event after the 1993 festivities.\nThompson returned to North Carolina State in 2003 to complete his degree in sociology. The next year, he shot an autobiographical film titled \"Skywalker\". He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on May 6, 1996, and introduced Michael Jordan for the latter's 2009 induction. He currently works as a motivational speaker and participates in events with the Hornets and Denver Nuggets.\nPersonal life.\nThompson and his wife Cathy had two daughters, Erika and Brooke. He shared the stage with his daughter Erika when the two graduated together on December 17, 2003, after he returned to earn his sociology degree. His daughter, Brooke, was a participant on Global GUTS. Cathy died in August 2016.\nCareer statistics.\nThompson's first professional year (1975–1976) was spent in the ABA. The rest of his career he played in the NBA due to the ABA–NBA merger in 1976."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1984 season began on December 22, 1984. The postseason tournament concluded with the San Francisco 49ers defeating the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX, 38–16, on January 20, 1985, at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California.\nSchedule.\nThe two wild card games were held on different days because both venues were in the Pacific Time Zone. Playoff games normally started at either 12:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time/9:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time or 4 p.m. EST/1 p.m. PST. The NFL did not schedule prime time playoff games on the east coast until 2002. A 9:30 a.m. PST game was considered too early to be played on the west coast.\nStarting with its coverage of Super Bowl XIX, ABC became part of the annual Super Bowl broadcasting rotation. The television rights to the first three rounds of the playoffs remained the same, with CBS televising the NFC games and NBC broadcasting the AFC games.\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 22, 1984.\nAFC: Seattle Seahawks 13, Los Angeles Raiders 7.\nThe Seahawks rushed on 51 plays for 205 yards and the defense intercepted 2 passes and recorded 6 sacks to avenge their AFC championship loss to LA in the previous season. The Raiders crossed midfield only three times during the whole game, while Seattle's defense and Jeff West's punting constantly made them start each drive deep in their own territory. Their possessions in the game started from the 20, 4, 20, 18, 16, 22, 30, 20, 16, 16, 22 and 6-yard lines.\nSeattle quarterback Dave Krieg completed only 4 of 10 passes in the game, but one was a 26-yard touchdown throw to Daryl Turner in the second quarter. Late in the third quarter, Seattle linebacker Bruce Scholtz forced a fumble from Frank Hawkins, and cornerback Keith Simpson recovered it on the Raiders 38. Krieg gained 13 yards with a scramble on the next play, and Norm Johnson finished the drive with a 35-yard field goal to put the team up 10-0 with 1:29 left in the third quarter. On LA's ensuing possession, quarterback Jim Plunkett, starting in his first game since week 6 of the regular season due to injuries, threw an interception to John Harris at the Seahawks 31-yard line, and Seattle ended up scoring another field goal on a 44-yard kick by Johnson, giving them a 13-0 lead.\nWith 5:05 left in the game, Plunkett threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to running back Marcus Allen. LA's defense managed to force a punt on the next series, but only after the Seahawks ran the clock down to 45 seconds, and West's kick pinned them back at their own 6-yard line. Seattle safety Kenny Easley then put the game away by intercepting a pass from Plunkett with 4 seconds left on the clock.\nDan Doornink recorded 29 carries for 126 rushing yards and a 14-yard reception. Defensive end Jacob Green had 2.5 sacks. Allen rushed for 61 yards, while also catching five passes for 90 yards and a score. This would be Seattle's last playoff victory until the 2005 NFC Divisional playoffs against the Washington Redskins.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Raiders and Seahawks. Los Angeles won the only previous meeting the previous year.\nIn his book about his years as a physician working for the Raiders \"You're OK, It's Just a Bruise\", Robert Huizenga wrote that Jacob Green's father had died suddenly in Texas right before the game, and Green was told by his mother that they were going to wait until the game was over to have Mr. Green's funeral so Jacob could be there to bury his dad. Green and his teammates dedicated the game to Mr. Green and absolutely destroyed the Raiders' offensive line on their way to victory.\nSunday, December 23, 1984.\nNFC: New York Giants 16, Los Angeles Rams 13.\nIn a defensive struggle, the Giants managed to pull out a win with key defensive stands on the last two LA drives.\nAfter forcing the Rams to punt on the opening drive, New York scored first with kicker Ali Haji-Sheikh's 37-yard field goal. On the Rams ensuing drive, Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor forced a fumble from Eric Dickerson, and defensive back Bill Currier recovered it at Los Angeles 23-yard line. This set up running back Rob Carpenter's 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Giants a 10-0 lead. Mike Lansford's 38-yard field goal in the second quarter cut the score to 10-3 going into halftime.\nHaji-Sheikh kicked a 39-yard field goal in the third quarter, but this was countered by Dickerson's 14-yard touchdown run, making the score 13-10. New York responded with Haji-Sheikh's 36-yard field goal five minutes later to go up by 6 points. LA then took the ball back and drove to a first down on the Giants 7-yard line, with Dickerson rushing four times for 44 yards along the way. Dickerson picked up 3 more yards on the next play, but then Giants defensive end Leonard Marshall dropped fullback Dwayne Crutchfield for a 3-yard loss and Jeff Kemp's 3rd down completion to Henry Ellard picked up just 2 yards. Faced with 4th and goal from the 5, the Rams decided to settle for Lansford's 22-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 16-13 with 7:02 left in the game.\nLos Angeles caught a break on the Giants next possession when Joe Morris' 61-yard run was eliminated by a holding penalty against center Kevin Belcher and the team ended up punting. This gave the Rams one last chance to drive for the tying field goal or winning touchdown at the 2:48 mark. However, they were unable to gain even a single first down. Faced with 4th and 6 after three plays, Kemp was sacked by George Martin and fumbled the ball. Linebacker Andy Headen recovered for New York on the Rams 33, enabling them to run out the rest of the clock.\nThis game marked an impressive turnaround for the Giants, who had finished the previous year with a 3-12-1 record. Both teams combined for just 406 yards (214 for LA, 192 for New York). The only offensive star of the game was Dickerson, who rushed for 107 yards and a touchdown, though he rushed for only 37 yards on 12 carries in the first half, including his costly fumble.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Giants and Rams.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 29, 1984.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 31, Seattle Seahawks 10.\nThe Dolphins ran off 70 plays, gained 405 yards of total offense (including an uncharacteristic 143 yards rushing), and scored 17 unanswered points in the second half as they avenged last season's divisional round upset loss to Seattle. Meanwhile, Miami's defense, which had given up 134 points in the last five games of the season, held the Seahawks to just 267 yards. The Dolphins defense was particularly dominating on the ground, where they held Seattle to a mere 51 yards on 18 rushing attempts, an average of less than 3 yards per carry.\nMiami started off the scoring with a 68-yard drive, featuring Dan Marino's 25-yard completion to Mark Clayton, that ended on Tony Nathan's 14-yard touchdown run. Near the end of the first quarter, Keith Simpson deflected a Marino pass into the arms of teammate John Harris, who returned the interception 32 yards to the Dolphins 39-yard line. Miami managed to keep the Seahawks out of the end zone, but Norm Johnson kicked a 27-yard field goal to put his team on the board at 7-3. On the Dolphins next drive, they were aided by a crucial penalty, an offsides call against the Seahawks that negated Marino's intercepted pass by Kenny Easley. Two plays later, Marino threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Cefalo, increasing the Dolphins lead to 14-3. However, Seattle quarterback Dave Krieg led his team back, firing a pass to receiver Steve Largent who caught the ball between two defenders and took off past cornerback Glen Blackwood for a 56-yard touchdown reception, cutting the score to 14-10 at the end of the half.\nHowever, any thoughts of a Seattle comeback were quickly crushed in the second half. Following a missed field goal attempt by Johnson, Marino led the Dolphins 76 yards down the field to a 3-yard scoring reception by tight end Bruce Hardy, making the score 21-10. Seattle was quickly forced to punt on their next drive, and Jeff West shanked the kick, causing the ball to travel just 7 yards. Two plays later, Miami increased their lead to 28-10 on Marino's 33-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mark Clayton. In the fourth quarter, Dolphins kicker Uwe von Schamann made a 37-yard field goal that put the final score at 31-10.\nMarino finished the game 21/34 for 262 yards and three touchdowns, with two interceptions (both by John Harris). The Dolphins 405 yards would be spread out quite evenly among the team, as their top rusher (Nathan) had only 76 yards, while their top receiver (Clayton) had 75. Krieg completed 20/35 passes for 234 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 2 yards and gaining one yard off a deflected pass that he caught himself. Largent was the top receiver of the game with 6 receptions for 128 yards and a touchdown.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Dolphins. Seattle won the only prior meeting the previous year.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 21, New York Giants 10.\nQuarterback Joe Montana threw for 309 yards and 3 touchdown passes as he led the 49ers to a victory, while receiver Dwight Clark caught 9 passes for 112 yards and a touchdown. The 49ers defense also played exceptionally well, holding the Giants offense to a single field goal even though Montana was intercepted 3 times.\nOn San Francisco's first drive of the game, Montana completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to Clark. Ronnie Lott intercepted a pass and returned it 38 yards to set up Montana's 9-yard pass to Russ Francis that gave the 49ers a 14-0 lead just 6:48 into the game. In the second quarter, Giants linebacker Gary Reasons recorded his first of two interceptions on the day setting up Ali Haji-Sheikh's 46-yard field goal. Then linebacker Harry Carson recorded the first interception in his 9-year career and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown that cut the score to 14–10. But Montana responded with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Solomon, making the score 21-10 by the end of the second quarter.\nBoth defenses then controlled the rest of the game, allowing no points in the second half. In the third quarter, New York drove to the 49ers 18-yard line, only to have Phil Simms throw an interception to linebacker Riki Ellison. In the fourth quarter, New York moved the ball to the San Francisco 11, but Simms was sacked on third down. Now faced with 4th and 16, they decided to play conservative and take the field goal, but Haji-Sheikh's 33-yard kick went wide right. Following a punt, New York got the ball with 3:04 left and drove to the 49ers 22, this time turning the ball over on downs when Joe Morris was stuffed for no gain on 4th and inches. Finally, with 53 seconds left, San Francisco's defense closed out the game when Fred Dean forced a fumble from Simms that was recovered by 49ers lineman Dwaine Board.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Giants and 49ers. San Francisco won the only prior meeting.\nSunday, December 30, 1984.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 23, Washington Redskins 19.\nThe Bears upset the Redskins' bid for a third consecutive NFC championship with clutch plays and a stout defense that forced 3 turnovers and 7 sacks. Chicago's victory was Washington's first and only playoff defeat throughout their tenure at RFK Stadium.\nWith the scored tied 3–3 in the second quarter, the Bears executed a halfback option play at the Redskins' 19-yard line, with running back Walter Payton throwing a 19-yard touchdown to Pat Dunsmore. Then on the second play in the third period, Bears wide receiver Willie Gault caught a short pass from quarterback Steve Fuller, evaded Redskins cornerback Darrell Green who was too aggressive in trying to make an interception, and turned upfield for a 75-yard touchdown. Redskins running back John Riggins capped off a 74-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run then cut the lead, 16–10. But a running into the punter penalty call against Ken Coffey set up Dennis McKinnon's 16-yard reception to cap a Chicago 77-yard scoring drive to push their lead back to 13 at 23–10.\nWashington attempted a comeback late in the third quarter. Rich Milot recovered a Fuller fumble at the Chicago 36-yard line, setting up a one-yard touchdown run by Riggins to cut the Bears lead to six. Then after being backed up deep in their own territory on fourth down with eight minutes left in the game, Chicago punter Dave Finzer stepped out of the end zone and gave the Redskins an intentional safety, making it 23–19. Washington then advanced to the Bears 24-yard line, but quarterback Joe Theismann threw three straight incompletions and Mark Moseley missed a 41-yard field goal attempt. Two other Washington possessions went nowhere and Chicago moved on to the NFC championship game.\nPayton finished the game with a career postseason high 104 rushing yards, and caught one pass for 12.\nThis game would be the only time in Joe Gibbs' original tenure in Washington that his team would lose their opening playoff game. It happened for the only other time in what was Gibbs' final game in his career in the 2007-08 NFL playoffs to the Seattle Seahawks.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Bears and Redskins. Both teams previously split the prior four meetings.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 24, Denver Broncos 17.\nSteelers running back Frank Pollard led the team to victory with 99 rushing yards, 4 receptions for 48 yards, and two touchdowns, the second in the game's closing minutes to the put Pittsburgh ahead for good.\nThe Broncos got their first chance to score after the opening drive, in which Rulon Jones's sack of Steelers quarterback Mark Malone forced a fumble that was recovered by defensive end Andre Townsend on the Steelers 23-yard line. But Denver only gained 1 yard with their next three plays and Rich Karlis missed a 39-yard field goal attempt. On the next play, Denver's Tom Jackson recovered a fumbled snap from Malone on the Steelers 22 set up quarterback John Elway's 9-yard touchdown pass to Jim Wright. Pittsburgh responded by moving the ball 62 yards to the Broncos 11-yard line, where Gary Anderson's 28-yard field goal made the score 7-3. Denver then drove to a 3rd and goal from the Steelers 6-yard line, only to lose the ball when Elway threw a pass that was intercepted by Pittsburgh defensive end Gary Dunn.\nLate in the second quarter, Pollard rushed 4 times for 45 yards on a 78-yard drive that ended with his 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Steelers a 10-7 lead with 1:14 left in the half.\nDenver tied the game in the third period when safety Roger Jackson blocked a punt give them a first and goal on the Pittsburgh 4-yard line, leading to Karlis' 21-yard field goal. The next time Denver got the ball, they drove 54 yards to take a 17-10 lead on Elway's 20-yard touchdown pass to Steve Watson (who finished with 11 receptions for 177 yards). But the Steelers tied the game with quarterback Mark Malone's 10-yard touchdown to Louis Lipps.\nWith 3 and half minutes left in the game, Pittsburgh drove into position for Anderson to attempt a go-ahead field goal, but he missed the kick from 26 yards. A few plays later, Steelers safety Eric Williams intercepted a pass from Elway and returned it 28 yards to the Broncos' 2-yard line to set up Pollard's winning 1-yard touchdown run.\nMalone finished the game with 227 passing yards and a touchdown. Elway threw for 184 yards and two scores, but was sacked four times and intercepted twice. This was Elway's first playoff game as a starter; because of the Broncos' elimination, he was denied the opportunity to play in the only Super Bowl to be held at his college home field, Stanford Stadium. The Steelers outgained Denver who was outgained in ten of their 16 games in the regular season and ranked bottom 10 on total offense and total defense. Running back Sammy Winder, who rushed for 1,153 yards during the season, was held to just 37 yards on 15 carries.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Steelers and Broncos. Both teams split the prior two meetings.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 6, 1985.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 45, Pittsburgh Steelers 28.\nPittsburgh racked up 455 yards of offense and converted 54% of their third downs, but it still wasn't enough to keep pace with Miami, who gained 569 yards in 71 plays en route to their fifth Super Bowl in franchise history. Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino led the Dolphins to a victory by throwing for 421 yards and 4 touchdowns (both AFC championship records) with 1 interception. Marino's record setting day was particularly noteworthy considering he threw his last pass with 11:05 left in the game. Steelers quarterback Mark Malone recorded 312 yards and 3 touchdowns, but was intercepted 3 times.\nMiami scored first on Marino's 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Clayton, but Pittsburgh countered with running back Rich Erenberg's 7-yard rushing touchdown. Then after Dolphins kicker Uwe von Schamann made a 26-yard field goal, the Steelers took the lead, 14–10, with wide receiver John Stallworth's 65-yard touchdown reception. Marino struck back with a 41-yard touchdown to wide receiver Mark Duper. Then Dolphins safety Lyle Blackwood picked off a pass from Malone and returned it 4 yards to the Steelers 35. After an 11-yard run by Tony Nathan, the Dolphins suffered a setback when a touchdown pass was wiped out by a penalty. But Marino easily shook this off, completing a 28-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose at the 1-yard line on the next play. Nathan finished off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run to give Miami a 24-14 halftime lead.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Marino completed a 36-yard touchdown pass to Duper. Then after Stallworth caught a 19-yard touchdown, the Dolphins scored two more touchdowns, including Marino's fourth score, to clinch the victory. Malone threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Wayne Capers in the final period to close out the scoring.\n\"We threw every defense we had at the guy -- zones, man-to-man, double- coverage, you name it, but the ball always seemed to get there before we did,\" Steelers safety Donnie Shell said. \"The guy is incredible. He deserves what he's going to get, and to me that looks like a Super Bowl ring.\"\nDuper finished the game with 5 receptions for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. Clayton caught 4 passes for 95 yards and a score. Nathan rushed for 61 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 8 passes for 114 yards. Stallworth caught 4 passes for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns in the final postseason game of his Hall of Fame career.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Steelers and Dolphins. Both teams split the previous two meetings.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 23, Chicago Bears 0.\nThe 49ers gained 387 yards while limiting the Bears to 186, with just 37 yards through the air. Chicago quarterback Steve Fuller completed just 13 of 22 passes for 87 yards and was sacked 9 times (twice each by Gary Johnson and Michael Carter).\nNeither team played particularly well in the first half. Chicago took the opening kickoff and moved the ball 54 yards, 29 on carries by Walter Payton. But the drive stalled at the 49ers 23 and ended with no points when Bob Thomas missed a 41-yard field goal attempt. San Francisco then drove to the Chicago 2-yard line in 8 plays, but quarterback Joe Montana fumbled the snap on third down and had to dive on the ball. After that, Ray Wersching kicked a 21-yard field goal to make the score 3-0. 49ers safety Dwight Hicks gave the team a great chance to increase their lead more by intercepting a pass from Fuller in Chicago territory. San Francisco made it all the way to the 2-yard line again, but this time they did not even get a field goal as Montana was intercepted in the end zone by safety Gary Fencik.\nA 66-yard drive to the Bears 4-yard set up Wersching's second field goal in the second quarter, giving the 49ers a 6-0 lead. Meanwhile, the Bears offense would go the entire period without gaining a first down. Fencik intercepted another pass from Montana, but Chicago could not do anything with the turnover opportunity.\nMidway through the third quarter, the 49ers got into the end zone on a 5-play drive in which they never passed the ball. Running back Wendell Tyler rushed three times on it for 25 yards, the last carry a 9-yard score. Montana later threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Solomon and Wersching finished off the scoring with a 34-yard field goal.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Bears and 49ers.\nSuper Bowl XIX: San Francisco 49ers 38, Miami Dolphins 16.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Dolphins and 49ers."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1983 season began on December 24, 1983. The postseason tournament concluded with the Los Angeles Raiders defeating the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII, 38–9, on January 22, 1984, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\nThis marked the first season since 1968 that legendary referee Jim Tunney did not receive an on-field playoff assignment. He was the alternate referee for the Super Bowl.\nSchedule.\nDue to Christmas falling on a Sunday, the two wild card playoff games were played in a span of three days, with one on Saturday, December 24, and the other on Monday, December 26.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, while CBS televised the NFC games and Super Bowl XVIII.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 24, 1983.\nAFC: Seattle Seahawks 31, Denver Broncos 7.\nBoth teams came into the game with remarkably similar seasons. Each had a 9–7 record, and both had gone through multiple starting quarterbacks. The Seahawks were starting Dave Krieg, who had replaced Jim Zorn in the ninth game of the season. Steve DeBerg started for the Broncos, returning to the lineup for the first time in seven weeks after suffering a separated shoulder.\nThe Seahawks won their first playoff game in team history with Krieg completing 12 of 13 passes for 200 yards and three touchdowns. They also got a big performance out of rookie running back Curt Warner, who rushed for 99 yards and caught three passes for 22 yards.\nSeattle scored on the opening drive of the game, with Warner carrying the ball on six of eight plays and Krieg hitting wide receiver Steve Largent for a 17-yard touchdown pass. After a few punts, the Broncos tied the game with Jesse Myles' 13-yard touchdown reception from DeBerg. After forcing Seattle to punt, DeBerg drove the Broncos to the Seahawks 29-yard line. However, Kerry Justin intercepted DeBerg's underthrown pass and returned the ball 45 yards to set up Norm Johnson's 37-yard field goal, giving the team a 10–7 lead. The Broncos responded with a drive to the Seattle 5-yard line, but once again they failed to score as running back Gerald Willhite lost the ball while being tackled by linebacker Shelton Robinson and safety Paul Moyer recovered it with less than two minutes left in the half.\nOn Seattle's first drive of the second half, Krieg completed a 28-yard pass to tight end Charle Young and a 34-yarder to Largent on the next play. Following two carries by Warner for six yards, Krieg finished the possession with a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Pete Metzelaars, making the score 17–7. The Seahawks went on to score two more touchdowns, an 18-yard pass from Krieg to Paul Johns on the first play of the fourth quarter, and a 2-yard run by the reserve fullback David Hughes with 9:34 remaining in the game. Meanwhile, Broncos rookie quarterback John Elway made his playoff debut, replacing DeBerg in the fourth quarter. He completed 10 of 15 passes for 123 yards and rushed for 16, but also threw an interception to Seahawks defensive back Gregg Johnson.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Broncos and Seahawks, and would not meet again in the playoffs until Super Bowl XLVIII.\nMonday, December 26, 1983.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 24, Dallas Cowboys 17.\nThe Rams converted three turnovers in the second half into 17 points to upset the heavily favored Cowboys in Dallas. Los Angeles opened the scoring in the first quarter on quarterback Vince Ferragamo's 18-yard touchdown pass to Drew Hill after an 85-yard drive. The Cowboys then tied the game with 23 seconds left in the half after quarterback Danny White capped a 70-yard drive with a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Hill.\nDallas took the lead in the third quarter with Rafael Septién's 41-yard field goal. But then the Rams took advantage of the Cowboys' turnovers. Los Angeles' Mike Wilcher recovered a muffed punt from Gary Allen at the Dallas 16-yard line, setting up wide receiver Preston Dennard's 16-yard touchdown reception. Then linebacker Jim Collins' interception set up Ferragamo's 8-yard pass to wide receiver George Farmer. Finally, LeRoy Irvin's 94-yard interception return to the Dallas 3-yard line set up Mike Lansford's 20-yard field goal. White was intercepted for the third time on Dallas' next drive, this time by linebacker Mel Owens. By the time White threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Doug Cosbie, only 1:03 remained on the game clock.\nRams rookie running back Eric Dickerson rushed for 99 yards and caught two passes for 11 yards. Tony Hill set a franchise playoff record with nine receptions for 115 yards. Ferragamo completed 15 of 30 passes for 162 yards and three touchdowns. White completed 32 of 53 passes for 330 yards and two touchdowns, with three costly interceptions.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Rams and Cowboys. Dallas had won four of the previous six meetings.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 31, 1983.\nAFC: Seattle Seahawks 27, Miami Dolphins 20.\nDespite their dominant win in the wild card round, the 9–7 Seahawks hardly seemed a significant obstacle for the defending AFC champion Dolphins However, the Seahawks converted three turnovers in the second half into thirteen points, while running back Curt Warner rushed for 113 yards, caught five passes for 38 yards, and scored two touchdowns. By the end of the game, Miami turned the football over five times, including consecutive fumbled kickoffs in the closing \nAfter a scoreless first quarter in the Orange Bowl, the Dolphins scored first on rookie quarterback Dan Marino's 19-yard pass to tight end Dan Johnson, but Uwe von Schamann's extra point attempt was blocked. Seattle running back Zachary Dixon returned the ensuing kickoff 59 yards to set up Dave Krieg's 6-yard touchdown pass to fullback Cullen Bryant and the Seahawks led 7–6. Near the end of the first half, Miami retook the lead with Marino's 32-yard touchdown pass to Mark Duper.\nIn the third quarter, Seattle defensive back John Harris recovered a fumble that led to Warner's 1-yard touchdown run and Seattle led 14–13. In the fourth quarter, Seahawks cornerback Kerry Justin's interception of a Marino pass was converted into a 27-yard field goal by Norm Johnson, increasing the lead to four \nWith time running out, Seattle made their only blunder of the day when Krieg threw an interception to Miami defensive back Gerald Small, who returned the ball 18 yards to set up Woody Bennett's 3-yard touchdown run, giving Miami a 20–17 lead with 3:43 remaining. Seattle receiver Steve Largent, who had no receptions up to this point, caught a pair of passes from Krieg for gains of 16 and 40 yards as they drove to retake the lead 24–20 on Warner's 2-yard touchdown run with under two minutes left. On the ensuing kickoff, Miami returner Fulton Walker fumbled and rookie reserve linebacker Sam Merriman recovered, setting up Johnson's 37-yard field goal to extend the lead to seven at 27–20. Amazingly, Walker fumbled on the next kickoff as well; Seattle running back Dan Doornink recovered and the offense ran out \nThis was Seattle's only road victory in the postseason until 2012, when they won in Washington 24–14. Harris finished the game with an interception, a fumble recovery, and four tackles. Other key defensive players for Seattle included Dave Brown, who had 10 tackles, and Keith Butler, who had nine. Duper caught nine passes for 117 yards and a touchdown.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Dolphins.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 24, Detroit Lions 23.\nLions kicker Eddie Murray made three field goals, including a postseason record 54-yard kick, but missed two attempts in the fourth quarter, the second a potential game-winning 43-yard kick with five seconds left.\nBoth teams came into this game missing key starters. The 49ers were without injured starting receiver Dwight Clark, while the Lions had to start quarterback Gary Danielson in place of injured starter Eric Hipple. Detroit scored first on Murray's 37-yard field goal less than five minutes into the game. They were poised to score again on their next drive, but Ronnie Lott intercepted a pass from Danielson on the San Francisco 15-yard line. The 49ers offense then drove 85 yards in 10 plays and took a 7–3 lead on a 1-yard touchdown run from Roger Craig. On the first play of Detroit's next drive, rookie linebacker Riki Ellison intercepted Danielson and returned the ball four yards to the Lions 24-yard line. Four plays later, Wendell Tyler's 2-yard touchdown run increased their lead to 14–3 early in the second quarter.\nThings kept getting worse for Detroit as Danielson threw two more interceptions on each of their next two possessions, first to safety Dwight Hicks and then to linebacker Keena Turner. However, their defense managed to prevent the 49ers from converting either one of them into points. On their next drive, running back Billy Sims took off for a 56-yard carry to the San Francisco 1-yard line before being tackled by Eric Wright. Despite a first and goal on the 1, Detroit could not get into the end zone and settled for Murray's second field goal, cutting the score to 14–6. Following a 49ers punt, Detroit moved the ball to San Francisco's 37-yard line in the closing seconds of the half, where Murray made a playoff record 54-yard field goal that made the score 14–9 going into halftime.\nIn the third quarter, Danielson threw his fifth interception of the day and his second to Ellison, who returned it four yards to the Lions 45. Joe Montana's 27-yard completion to tight end Russ Francis and Tyler's 11-yard run gave the team a first and goal from the 7, but the Lions made a key goal line stand to force Ray Wersching's 19-yard field goal, putting San Francisco up 17–9. Danielson then rallied the Lions back with six completions on a 10-play, 73-yard drive that ended with Sims' 11-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 17–16 with 13:36 left in the fourth quarter.\nTheir defense subsequently gave them a great chance to take the lead when they recovered a fumble from Craig on the 49ers 37-yard line. But penalties stalled the drive and Murray missed a 43-yard field goal attempt. Still, the Lions defense came up with another huge opportunity as Bobby Watkins intercepted a pass from Montana and returned it 24 yards to the San Francisco 27. This time the Lions offense managed to convert the turnover with a 2-yard touchdown run by Sims, giving them their first lead of the game, 23–17 with 4:44 remaining.\nUp to this point, Montana had been rather ineffective, completing just 12 of 25 passes for 151 yards with an interception and no touchdowns. But with the game on the line, Montana rallied his team with a scoring drive to put them back into the lead. Starting from their own 30-yard line, the 49ers advanced to the Lions 27 by the two-minute warning, with Montana completing four passes for 24 yards. Montana hooked up with Francis for a 13-yard gain on the next play, and then threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Solomon, giving the 49ers a 24–23 lead with 1:23 left. Detroit then drove 49 yards to set up a game-winning 43-yard field goal attempt for Murray in the closing seconds, but his kick was wide right by a narrow margin, enabling San Francisco to win the game.\nMontana finished the game completing 18 of 31 passes for 201 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also rushing for 16 yards. Danielson finished his only career playoff game completing 24 of 38 passes for 236 yards, but was intercepted five times. Sims was the top rusher of the game with 20 carries for 116 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught four passes for 26 yards.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Lions and 49ers. Detroit won the previous meeting.\nThe 1983-84 NFL Divisional Round game began a streak of playoff success for San Francisco-based teams over their Detroit counterparts. In 2012, the San Francisco Giants swept the Detroit Tigers in the World Series, then in 2024, the 49ers again defeated the Lions in the NFC Championship.\nSunday, January 1, 1984.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 51, Los Angeles Rams 7.\nThe Redskins crushed the Rams by scoring on their first five possessions on their way to a 51–7 win, breaking the then-record for the largest margin of victory in their team history.\nWashington drove 65 yards in eight plays on their opening possession, including NFL MVP Joe Theismann's 29-yard completion to Charlie Brown on third down and 5, while John Riggins rushed six times for 23 yards and scored with a 3-yard touchdown run. Five minutes later, Theismann threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to receiver Art Monk. An interception by Anthony Washington then set up kicker Mark Moseley's 42-yard field goal with less than a minute left in the first quarter. Nick Giaquinto then returned a punt 48 yards to set up a one-yard touchdown run by Riggins to give the Redskins a 24–0 lead only a minute into the second quarter.\nAt this point, LA finally managed to respond with Vince Ferragamo's 32-yard touchdown pass to Preston Dennard, cutting the score to 24–7. But this was as close as it would get, as the Redskins added two more touchdowns before halftime, a 21-yard catch by Monk and a 1-yard run by Riggins.\nMoseley's two field goals were the only scoring in the third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter, defensive back Darrell Green intercepted a pass from Ferragamo after it bounced off Eric Dickerson and returned it 72 yards for a touchdown.\nRiggins recorded 119 yards and three touchdowns. Theismann completed 18 of 23 passes for 302 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. Brown caught six passes for 171 yards. Meanwhile, Ferragamo completed only 20 of 43 passes for 175 yards and a touchdown, with three interceptions. And Dickerson, who led the league in rushing during the regular season, was limited to only 16 yards on 10 carries, and nine yards on six receptions.\nThe Rams' loss meant that the following week's title game was the first NFC Championship Game ever to not involve either them or the Dallas Cowboys.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Rams and Redskins. Los Angeles won both previous meetings.\nAFC: Los Angeles Raiders 38, Pittsburgh Steelers 10.\nThe Raiders scored three touchdowns in the third quarter en route to a 38–10 win over the Steelers, who were playing without Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw due to injury.\nIn the first quarter, a 15-yard run by Steelers running back Frank Pollard and Cliff Stoudt's 44-yard completion to Wayne Capers sparked a 78-yard drive, but when faced with fourth down and inches near the goal line, they opted for kicker Gary Anderson's 17-yard field goal. The Steelers defense forced a punt on the next drive, but Ray Guy's 34-yard kick pinned them on their own 14-yard line, and on the next play, Raiders defensive back Lester Hayes returned an interception 18 yards for a touchdown, making the score 7–3.\nAfter forcing a punt, Los Angeles running back Marcus Allen started off a drive with two carries for 13 yards. Then Jim Plunkett got his team rolling, completing a 9-yard pass to tight end Todd Christensen, a 17-yard pass to Allen, and two passes to Cliff Branch for 34 yards, moving the ball to the Steelers 5-yard line. Allen eventually finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown run, increasing the Raiders lead to 14–3 in the second quarter. Later on, after Los Angeles received a Steelers punt with 1:02 left in the half, Allen's 21-yard run and Plunkett's 17-yard completion to Branch set up a 45-yard field goal from Chris Bahr, giving the Raiders a 17–3 halftime lead.\nThe Raiders then scored three touchdowns in the third quarter to put the game out of reach. First they took the opening kickoff and stormed 72 yards to a 9-yard touchdown run by Kenny King. Then after a punt, Allen scored on a 49-yard touchdown run, increasing his team's lead to 31–3. Pittsburgh managed to respond with Stoudt's 58-yard touchdown pass to receiver John Stallworth. But Los Angeles stormed right back, scoring on Frank Hawkins' 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 38–10. This turned out to be the last score of the game, as both teams' defenses took over during the fourth quarter.\nAllen finished the game with 121 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just 13 carries, while also catching five passes for 38 yards. Raiders defensive end Lyle Alzado had 2.5 sacks.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Steelers and Raiders. Pittsburgh had won three of the previous five meetings when the Raiders were based in Oakland. This would be the only postseason meeting with the Raiders playing in Los Angeles.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 8, 1984.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 24, San Francisco 49ers 21.\nAfter the 49ers erased a 21–0 fourth quarter deficit, two controversial penalties against San Francisco led to the Redskins' kicker Mark Moseley overcoming an awful day and kicking the winning field goal.\nThe first quarter was scoreless. The closest either team came was Washington's drive inside the 49ers 30-yard line that ended when Joe Washington lost a fumble that was recovered by San Francisco lineman Lawrence Pillers. In the second quarter, Washington managed to fool the 49ers with a trick play when punt returner Nick Giaquinto threw the ball across the field to Darrell Green who took it all the way to the end zone, but Giaquinto inadvertently threw a forward pass rather than a lateral and the score was called back. Washington fans and news media at the time disputed whether this was actually a forward pass, calling it the \"Micrometer Play.\" The suggestion was that one would need a high precision measuring device to determine that the play was indeed a forward pass, and that the referees got the call wrong. The Redskins still managed to drive into 49ers territory, but ended up with no points when Moseley's 45-yard field goal attempt went wide right.\nAfter forcing a punt, Joe Theismann's 46-yard completion to tight end Clint Didier moved the ball to the 49ers 18-yard line, setting up a 4-yard touchdown run by fullback John Riggins with 6:16 left in the half. Later in the quarter, the Redskins drove deep into San Francisco territory, featuring a fourth down run by Jeff Hayes on a fake punt, but once again Moseley sent a field goal attempt wide right, this time from 35 yards, and the score remained 7–0 at the end of the half.\nSan Francisco started the second half with a drive into Washington territory, aided by a controversial ruling in which running back Wendell Tyler dropped the ball just a second after catching it and then dove on it. Officials ruled the play a fumble and recovery for the 49ers rather than an incompletion. But kicker Ray Wersching later slipped on the muddy field while attempting a 50-yard field goal and it fell well short. On Washington's next drive, they ran another trick play, this time a pass from Riggins, who threw a 36-yard completion to Charlie Brown inside the 49ers 10-yard line. But all that led to was Moseley's third missed field goal attempt of the day, this one from 38 yards, that he once again sent wide right.\nMidway through the third quarter, San Francisco receiver Freddie Solomon lost a fumble while being tackled by Green that linebacker Rich Milot recovered on the 49ers 36-yard line. A few plays later, a pass interference penalty on defensive back Ronnie Lott moved the ball to the 6-yard line, and Riggins took it the final six yards to the end zone with three more runs, making the score 14–0. Then on their next drive, Theismann completed a 70-yard touchdown pass to Brown, giving Washington a 21–0 lead with just over a minute left until the final quarter.\nBut with 14:37 left in the game, 49ers quarterback Joe Montana completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wilson. San Francisco subsequently forced a punt, but returner Dana McLemore fumbled the ball and Washington's Mark Murphy recovered it. Still, the Redskins were unable to capitalize, failing to get a first down and once again coming up empty when Moseley missed his fourth field goal attempt of the day, this time short from 41 yards. On the next play, Solomon caught a 76-yard touchdown pass from Montana. Later with 7:08 remaining, Wilson tied the game with a 12-yard touchdown reception.\nThe Redskins then marched on a 13-play, 78-yard drive that took 6:12 off the clock and set up Moseley's 25-yard field goal with 40 seconds left in the game. This possession was aided by two controversial penalties:\nThe 49ers got the ball back one last time, but Montana attempting a Hail Mary pass was intercepted by Vernon Dean on the final play of the game, sealing Washington's victory.\nBrown finished the game with five receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown, while Riggins rushed for 123 yards and two touchdowns. In addition, his 36-yard completion to Brown was the only completion he would ever throw during his 14-season career. This was the only postseason meeting between Hall of Fame coaches Bill Walsh and Joe Gibbs, whose teams would combine for six Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl wins during the 1980s.\nThe game was featured as part of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\", known as The Forgotten Classic.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the 49ers and Redskins. San Francisco won the only previous meeting.\nAFC: Los Angeles Raiders 30, Seattle Seahawks 14.\nSeattle had defeated Los Angeles twice during the regular season, but this game had a very different outcome. The Raiders outgained Seattle in total yards 405–197, intercepted five passes, jumped to a 20–0 halftime lead, and overcame four turnovers of their own en route to a 30–14 victory. The Seahawks were held to 65 rushing yards while Raiders running back Marcus Allen ran for 154 yards, caught seven passes for 62 yards, and scored two touchdowns.\nSeahawks running back David Hughes returned the opening kickoff 34 yards to the 40-yard line, and his team drove to the Raiders 34 from there. But defensive back Lester Hayes picked off a pass from Dave Krieg and returned it 44 yards to the Seattle 26. On the Raiders ensuing drive, a 19-yard run by Allen set up a 20-yard field goal by Chris Bahr. In the second quarter, Allen broke off a 16-yard run, while Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett completed passes to Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell for gains of 11 and 20 yards on a 61-yard drive that ended with Frank Hawkins' 1-yard touchdown run. Then Seattle went three and out and LA got the ball back with good position on their 40-yard line. Plunkett's 49-yard completion to Barnwell then set up Hawkins' second rushing touchdown, making the score 17–0. With 1:02 left in the half, Seattle desperately tried to put some points on the board before halftime, but defensive back Mike Davis intercepted a pass from Krieg at his own 40-yard line. A 20-yard completion from Plunkett to Barnwell then set up Bahr's 45-yard field goal to give the Raiders a 20–0 halftime lead.\nIn the second half, Seattle finally got a scoring opportunity when Hawkins fumbled the ball on the first play from scrimmage and the Seahawks recovered. However, all they got from this was Krieg's third interception, this one to linebacker Matt Millen on the first play after the fumble. At this point, Krieg was benched and replaced by backup Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, LA drove to the Seahawks 9-yard line. Defensive back Gregg Johnson intercepted a pass from Plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game, but even this turned out to be insufficient. Just two plays later, Davis recorded his second interception of the day, this one on the Seattle 46. On the next play, Allen took off for a 43-yard burst, and then caught a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0.\nAfter being completely dominated up to that point, Seattle finally managed to strike back, moving the ball 74 yards in 10 plays and scoring on Zorn's 11-yard touchdown pass to running back Dan Doornink. Then Seattle linebacker Bruce Scholtz intercepted a pass that bounced out of Barnwell's hands on the Seahawks 25-yard line, but once again Los Angeles' defense proved too formidable, as a 2-yard loss on a screen pass to Curt Warner, a holding penalty, and incomplete passes pushed Seattle out of field goal range and forced a punt.\nThe start of the fourth quarter saw the Seahawks blow another scoring chance when Vann McElroy intercepted a pass from Zorn after the team had recovered Plunkett's fumbled pitch to Allen on the Los Angeles 25-yard line. Then the next time they had the ball, they drove to the LA 40-yard line, only to see Greg Townsend sack Zorn for a 23-yard loss on fourth down and 4. After the turnover on downs, Bahr kicked a 35-yard field goal to give the Raiders an insurmountable 30–7 lead with 3:57 left. At this point, all that remained was Zorn's meaningless touchdown pass to tight end Charle Young, making the final score 30–14.\nWarner, the AFC's leading rusher during the regular season, was held to just 26 yards on 11 carries. Barnwell finished the game with a career postseason high five receptions for 116 yards. Townsend had two sacks.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Raiders.\nSuper Bowl XVIII: Los Angeles Raiders 38, Washington Redskins 9.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Redskins and Raiders.\nQuotes.\nBill King of KRLA - calling the first touchdown of Super Bowl XVIII in 1984 for the Raiders. - \nBill King of KRLA - calling a touchdown by Cliff Branch in Super Bowl XVIII in 1984 for the Raiders. - \nBill King of KRLA - calling a touchdown by Jack Squirek in Super Bowl XVIII in 1984 for the Raiders. - \nBill King of KRLA - calling the first touchdown of Marcus Allen in Super Bowl XVIII in 1984 for the Raiders. - \nBill King of KRLA - calling the second touchdown of Marcus Allen in Super Bowl XVIII in 1984 for the Raiders. - "

        "title": "2000 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2000 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1999–2000 season, and the culmination of the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested by the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Devils against the Western Conference champion and defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars. The Devils were led by captain Scott Stevens, head coach Larry Robinson and goaltender Martin Brodeur. The Stars were led by captain Derian Hatcher, head coach Ken Hitchcock and goaltender Ed Belfour. The Devils defeated the Stars 4–2 in a six-game series to win their second Stanley Cup in franchise history. This was the first, and along with 2001 the only Finals where two relocated teams faced each other.\nPaths to the Finals.\nNew Jersey defeated the Florida Panthers 4–0, the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–2 and the Philadelphia Flyers 4–3 to advance to the Finals.\nDallas defeated the Edmonton Oilers 4–1, the San Jose Sharks 4–1 and the Colorado Avalanche 4–3 to advance to the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nDespite New Jersey being a lower seed in conference play (4) than Dallas (2), New Jersey's 103 points were one more than Dallas, giving them home-ice advantage in the series. The Devils won the Cup in game six on a one-timer goal by Jason Arnott in double overtime. It was their second Stanley Cup overall and first since 1995.\nFor the Stars, this was the first time since the New York Islanders lost to the Edmonton Oilers in the 1984 Finals that a defending Stanley Cup champion lost in the Finals. This happened to the Devils themselves the following year when they lost to the Colorado Avalanche. This would be the last appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals for the Stars until 2020.\nThis was the first Finals that featured two relocated teams competing for the Stanley Cup, as well as the first Finals in which both teams had won the Stanley Cup previously after relocation.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2000 Stanley Cup was presented to Devils captain Scott Stevens by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Devils 2–1 double overtime win over the Stars in game six.\nThe following Devils players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1999–2000 New Jersey Devils\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised on CBC. In the United States, this was the first year under the new joint American TV contract with the Disney-owned networks ESPN and ABC, with ESPN airing the first two games of the Cup Finals and ABC broadcasting the rest of the series. Devils team broadcasters Mike Miller and Randy Velischek called the series on local radio on WABC–AM 770 in New York City. In Dallas, Stars broadcasters Ralph Strangis and Daryl Reaugh called the series on WBAP 820 AM."

        "title": "1982–83 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1982 season began on January 8, 1983. The postseason tournament concluded with the Washington Redskins defeating the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XVII, 27–17, on January 30, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nA players' strike reduced the regular season to nine games. Thus, the league used a special 16-team playoff format (dubbed the \"Super Bowl Tournament\"), just for this year. Division standings were ignored (although each division did send at least one team to the playoffs). Eight teams from each conference were seeded 1–8 based on their regular season records.\nBecause of the eight-game first round, this was the first (and currently only) time that NFL playoff games were regionally televised across the United States instead of nationwide. This year was also the only season in which the conference championship games were played on separate days.\nWith the altered format and expanded playoff field, this season saw the first playoff berths given to teams with losing records (win percentage &lt; .500), as both Cleveland and Detroit finished with 4–5 records (.444). Both teams lost in the first round of the playoffs. Since then, the 2010 Seattle Seahawks, 2014 Carolina Panthers, 2020 Washington Football Team, and 2022 Tampa Bay Buccaneers have won their division with losing records, with the 2010 Seahawks becoming the first sub-.500 team to make the playoffs in a full-length season and becoming the first sub-.500 team to win a playoff game.\nThe expanded playoff format made it possible for a team to host three games in the postseason, which Washington and Miami both did. Under the typical playoff format at the time, this was not possible as all wild-card round winners would always play away games in the divisional round. With the expansion to fourteen playoff teams starting in 2020–21, it is once again possible for a team to host three playoff games in the same season. This was first exemplified in the 2021 Kansas City Chiefs.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, CBS televised the NFC playoff games, while NBC broadcast the AFC games and Super Bowl XVII.\nThe players' strike and the reduced regular season caused the playoffs and Super Bowl to be delayed by one week than what they were originally scheduled for (the playoffs in the 1980s usually began at or near the last weekend of December). Because of the eight-game first round, this was the first (and currently only) time that NFL playoff games were regionally televised across the United States instead of nationwide. The league still used the two traditional weekend 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST time slots, and did not hold prime time postseason games until the 2001–02 playoffs. Furthermore, scheduling conflicts forced the conference championship games to be played on separate days.\nFirst Round playoffs.\nSaturday, January 8, 1983.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 31, Detroit Lions 7.\nThe Redskins jumped to a 24–0 lead en route to an easy 31–7 victory over the Lions, who were in their first postseason game since 1970. Washington receiver Alvin Garrett, who caught only one pass during the regular season, recorded six receptions for 110 yards and three touchdowns. Fullback John Riggins led the team on the ground with 119 rushing yards. Quarterback Joe Theismann compiled 210 passing yards and three touchdowns. While the Redskins only outgained the Lions by two yards (366 to 364), they intercepted two passes and recovered three fumbles, while losing no turnovers themselves.\nThe game seemed to start well for Detroit, as they reached the Redskins 21-yard line on their opening drive. But halfback Billy Sims lost a fumble that was recovered by Washington linebacker Rich Milot. The next time the Lions had the ball, Jeris White intercepted a pass intended for Sims and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown, the second longest interception return in NFL playoff history. Then on their third possession, quarterback Eric Hipple was sacked by blitzing cornerback Vernon Dean causing a fumble that defensive tackle Darryl Grant recovered on the Redskins 19-yard line. This set up Mark Moseley's 26-yard field goal to make the score 10–0 with just over two minutes left in the first quarter.\nWashington increased their lead to 17–0 early in the second quarter with Theismann's 21-yard touchdown pass to Garrett. Detroit responded with a drive to the Redskins 5-yard line, but came up empty again when Dave Butz forced a fumble from Sims that was recovered by defensive end Dexter Manley. Washington then drove 96 yards to score on Garrett's second 21-yard touchdown catch, giving the team a 24–0 first half lead.\nIn the third quarter, Washington essentially put the game away with a 5-play, 74-yard drive that ended with Garrett's third touchdown of the day, this one a 27-yard catch, making the lead 31–0. Meanwhile, all Detroit could do was avoid a shutout on Hipple's 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Hill, the Lions' first playoff score since the 1957 NFL Championship Game.\nLions receiver Leonard Thompson was the top performer for his team with seven receptions for 150 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Lions and Redskins.\nThe same teams met in the same stadium nine years later for the NFC championship, with the Redskins routing the Lions 41–10 en route to the Super Bowl XXVI title.\nThe teams would meet a third time in 1999, with Washington winning again 27–13.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 41, St. Louis Cardinals 16.\nIn the first playoff game at Lambeau Field since the Ice Bowl in 1967, Green Bay quarterback Lynn Dickey threw for 260 yards and four touchdowns en route to a 41–16 win. The Packers scored four touchdowns on four consecutive possessions and finished the game with 453 yards. It was their first playoff victory since Super Bowl II in 1968, as well as the Packers only playoff win in the twenty-five seasons from 1968 to 1992.\nCardinals kicker Neil O'Donoghue gave the team a 3–0 lead with an 18-yard field goal on their opening drive, however this would be the extent of his success. By the end of the game, he missed attempts from 44 and 45 yards, while also having a 44-yard attempt and an extra point kick blocked, both by Packers tight end Gary Lewis. Meanwhile, Green Bay responded to his field goal with a 60-yard touchdown pass from Dickey to receiver John Jefferson.\nThere would be no more scoring until 5:45 remained in the half, when the Packers suddenly buried St. Louis with three consecutive touchdowns. First, Cardinals safety Benny Perrin slipped while covering James Lofton in the end zone, and Dickey threw him the ball for a 20-yard score. Then Packers linebacker George Cumby recovered Stump Mitchell's fumble on the Packers 39. Dickey's subsequently completed a 30-yard pass to Jefferson and Eddie Lee Ivery broke off an 18-yard run before finishing the drive with a 2-yard rushing score. Two plays later, safety Mark Murphy intercepted Neil Lomax's pass and returned it 22 yards to the Cardinals 12-yard line, setting up Dickey's 4-yard touchdown toss to Ivery that gave Green Bay a 28–3 lead. St. Louis managed to respond with Lomax's 5-yard touchdown pass to Pat Tilley with nine seconds left in the half, but Lewis blocked the extra point, and their 28–9 halftime deficit ended up being as close as the score would ever get.\nGreen Bay increased their lead to 31–9 with Jan Stenerud's 46-yard field goal on their opening drive of the second half. In the final minute of the third quarter, they went up 38–9 on Dickey's fourth touchdown pass of the day, a 7-yarder to Jefferson at the end of an 89-yard drive that included a 43-yard pass interference penalty against defensive back Carl Allen. In the fourth quarter, Stenerud kicked a 34-yard field goal, while Lomax closed out the scoring on an 18-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mike Shumann with 8:13 left in regulation.\nBy the end of the game, the Packers had set numerous franchise post season records, including most touchdown passes in a game (4), most receiving yards (6 receptions for 148 yards by Jefferson), and longest field goal (46 yards by Stenerud).\nCardinals receiver Roy Green caught nine passes for 113 yards. Lomax completed 32 of 51 passes for 385 yards and two touchdowns, but was intercepted twice and sacked five times, twice by defensive end Mike Butler.\nThis was the Cardinals' last postseason game representing St. Louis. The franchise relocated to Arizona in 1988 and did not return to the playoffs until 1998. The city of St. Louis would not be represented again in the NFL postseason until the Rams, who moved to the city in 1995, won Super Bowl XXXIV following the 1999 season.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cardinals and Packers.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 28, New England Patriots 13.\nThis first round playoff game featured a rematch of the infamous Snowplow Game earlier in the regular season, replete with a pregame reenactment of the kick. The Dolphins controlled most of the game with four long touchdown drives, and intercepted Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan twice. Miami's mobile quarterback David Woodley had one of the best performances of his career, completing 16 of 19 passes for 246 yards and two touchdowns (both to tight end Bruce Hardy) with no interceptions, while also rushing for 16 yards. Woodley's passer rating for this game was 153.8. Miami running back Andra Franklin had 26 carries for 112 yards and a touchdown. Miami significantly outgained New England in total yards (448 to 237) and rushing yards (214 to 77).\nAfter a quiet and scoreless first quarter, New England took a 3–0 lead three minutes into the second quarter with a drive sustained by the rushing of Mark van Eeghen and capped off by John Smith's 23-yard field goal, but it would last just five minutes before Woodley finished a 76-yard drive with a 2-yard play action touchdown pass to tight end Bruce Hardy. The next time Miami had the ball, they drove 79 yards balancing Miami's running game and Woodley's passing and scrambling to culminate with a 1-yard touchdown run by Franklin, giving the home team a 14–3 halftime lead with the Miami pass rush snuffing out the Patriots' offensive efforts.\nThe Patriots, who lost their 15th consecutive game in the Orange Bowl and struggling with the absence of star Defensive End Kenneth Sims, were on the verge of getting blown out as Miami drove down the field with their power running game led by Franklin and Tony Nathan, but a red zone fumble gave New England the ball at the Miami 37, and a Grogan to Lin Dawson pass helped the Patriots reduced the lead to 14–6 on Smith's 42-yard field goal early in the third quarter. That would be as close to a lead as the Patriots would get, as the Dolphins scored again with touchdowns from Woody Bennett and then another 2-yard catch by Hardy late in the third quarter off a play-action pass by Woodley in the middle of the fourth. Grogan rallied the Patriots to throw a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Don Hasselbeck With 5:32 left in the game, but a late Patriots interception sealed the final score at 28–13.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Patriots and Dolphins.\nAFC: Los Angeles Raiders 27, Cleveland Browns 10.\nThe Raiders gained 510 total yards of offense and held the Browns to 284. Faced with a hard-fought 10–10 tie late in the second quarter, the Raiders scored 17 unanswered points and shut Cleveland out in the second half. Quarterback Jim Plunkett threw for 386 yards, while running back Marcus Allen rushed for 72 yards, caught six passes for 74 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Receiver Cliff Branch caught five passes for 121 yards, while tight end Todd Christensen caught six passes for 93. Linebacker Rod Martin and defensive tackle Johnny Robinson each had two of LA's six sacks.\nOn the Raiders first drive, Plunkett's 64-yard completion to Branch set up a 27-yard field goal from Chris Bahr. Their next two drives ended with Plunkett being intercepted, first by Browns defensive back Clarence Scott and later by Hanford Dixon. However, both picks were in Cleveland territory and the Browns could not convert either into points. On Dixon's interception, they managed to reach midfield before linebacker Ted Hendricks sacked Browns quarterback Paul McDonald for a 10-yard loss, bringing up third down and 16. McDonald completed a 15-yard pass to Dwight Walker on the next play, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, linebacker Matt Millen and defensive tackle Lyle Alzado stuffed running back Mike Pruitt for no gain. Los Angeles took over and drove to the Browns 11-yard line, featuring a 34-yard reception by Allen. But linebacker Clay Matthews sacked Plunkett for a 9-yard loss, and following a third down completion, Bahr missed a field goal attempt from 35 yards.\nOn their first drive of the second quarter, Cleveland managed to tie the game with McDonald's 47-yard completion to Ricky Feacher setting up Matt Bahr's franchise playoff record 52-yard field goal. But Los Angeles quickly stormed back with an 88-yard scoring drive. Plunkett completed five passes on the way to the end zone, including a pair of 24-yarders to Christensen and Branch, while Allen finished the drive a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Raiders a 10–3 lead. With 2:01 left in the half, Cleveland tied the game at the end of a 76-yard drive with McDonald's 43-yard touchdown pass to Feacher. But aided by Greg Pruitt's 40-yard kickoff return to the Raiders 40, Plunkett was able to get his team into scoring range, completing three passes for 26 yards and rushing for 11. Chris Bahr kicked a 37-yard field goal on the last play of the quarter, giving LA a 13–10 lead going into halftime.\nCleveland took the opening kickoff and drove to the Raiders 14-yard line. But in what turned out to be the crucial play of the game, running back Charles White lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Jeff Barnes. After the turnover, LA drove 89 yards and increased their lead to 20–10 on Allen's 3-yard touchdown run. Cleveland would never mount a serious scoring threat for the rest of the game. In the fourth quarter, Los Angeles essentially put it out of reach with a 65-yard drive, including Plunkett's completions to Malcolm Barnwell for 26 yards and Branch for 15, that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Frank Hawkins, making the final score 27–10.\nMcDonald completed 18 of 37 passes for 281 yards and a touchdown. His top target was Feacher, who caught four passes for 124 yards and a score. Cleveland fell to 0–2 in playoff games at the Los Angeles Coliseum, joining a setback to the Rams in the 1951 NFL Championship Game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Browns and Raiders. The then-Oakland Raiders won the only previous meeting.\nSunday, January 9, 1983.\nAFC: New York Jets 44, Cincinnati Bengals 17.\nThe underdog Jets, playing their first road playoff game in franchise history, overcame an early 14–3 deficit against the defending AFC champions by racking up 517 yards of offense and scoring 21 points in the fourth quarter. Running back Freeman McNeil led the Jets to a victory with 210 rushing yards (an NFL playoff record, surpassing the old one of 206 by Keith Lincoln in the 1963 AFL playoffs) and a touchdown, while also catching a pass for nine yards and throwing a touchdown pass on a halfback option play. Receiver Wesley Walker caught eight passes for 145 yards and a touchdown. Jets quarterback Richard Todd completed 20 of 28 passes for 269 yards and a touchdown. Playing in the final postseason game of his legendary career, Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson completed 26 of 35 passes for a career playoff high 354 yards and two touchdowns, but was intercepted three times. Receiver Cris Collinsworth caught seven passes for 120 yards. This was New York's first playoff win since Super Bowl III in the 1968 season.\nCincinnati opened up the scoring with an 81-yard drive that ended with Anderson's 32-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Curtis. New York responded with Todd's 49-yard completion to Walker that set up a 32-yard field goal by Pat Leahy and cut the score to 7–3. Cincinnati found themselves facing third down and 30 on their ensuing possession, but it didn't stop them from picking up a first down with Anderson's 53-yard pass to Collinsworth, and he later finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dan Ross, giving the Bengals a 14–3 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nNew York responded by driving 80 yards in 10 plays to cut the score to 14–10 with McNeil's 14-yard touchdown throw to Derrick Gaffney on a halfback option pass. Cincinnati countered with a 75-yard drive to the Jets' 10-yard line, but Johnnie Lynn's interception on the 1 eliminated the scoring chance and resulted in a huge reversal of momentum. After the turnover, New York moved the ball 85 yards in 11 plays, featuring a 24-yard run by McNeil. Todd finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Walker, giving New York a 17–14 lead. Then after a punt, Todd's 44-yard completion to Walker set up a 25-yard Leahy field goal, making the score 20–14 going into halftime.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, McNeil's 35-yard run gave the Jets a first down on the Cincinnati 27-yard line. But on the next play, Todd threw a pass that was deflected by Glenn Cameron and intercepted by Ken Riley. Following a punt, McNeil's 33-yard run put New York on the Bengals' 30, and this time the team managed to cash in with a 47-yard Leahy field goal, giving them a 23–14 lead. Anderson led the Bengals back, completing passes to Ross and Steve Kreider for gains of 25 and 17 yards as the team drove 75 yards to score on Jim Breech's 20-yard field goal. So despite giving up 20 unanswered points, the Bengals were only trailing 23–17. And on the last play of the third quarter, Bengals safety Bobby Kemp forced a fumble from Gaffney that cornerback Mike Fuller recovered and returned 20 yards to the Jets' 35.\nHowever, the Bengals self-destructed in the fourth quarter, suffering one of the worst collapses in franchise history. After catching a 9-yard pass, Bengals running back Pete Johnson failed to pick up the first down with consecutive runs, and Breech missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. New York then drove 72 yards to go up 30–17 on McNeil's 20-yard touchdown run. On the first play of the Bengals' ensuing drive, Anderson threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to Collinsworth, only to see it wiped out by a false start penalty on right tackle Mike Wilson. Cincinnati still managed to drive to the Jets' 6-yard line, but then had another touchdown eliminated, this time a 6-yard run by Anderson cancelled out by an illegal motion penalty on Ross. On the next play, Anderson's pass was intercepted by safety Darrol Ray and returned a playoff record 98 yards for a touchdown, giving New York a 37–17 lead with less than 5 minutes left in the game. After Cincinnati got the ball back, Lynn recorded his second interception of the day, returning this one 26 yards to the Bengals' 26, and New York went on to score on the final points of the game with a 1-yard touchdown run by Dwayne Crutchfield.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Jets and Bengals.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 31, Pittsburgh Steelers 28.\nThe game began disastrously for the Chargers when James Brooks fumbled the opening kickoff, which was recovered for a touchdown by Guy Ruff of the Steelers. But San Diego battled back, winning by overcoming an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Dan Fouts threw for 333 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions to lead his team to victory. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw for 325 yards and two touchdowns and scored a rushing touchdown in his final postseason game, but was intercepted twice. Chargers running back Chuck Muncie rushed for 126 yards and caught a pass for 12, while tight end Kellen Winslow caught seven passes for 102 yards and two touchdowns. Steelers receiver John Stallworth caught eight passes for 116 yards and a touchdown.\nAmazingly, Brooks fumbled the next kickoff after Ruff's touchdown, but he managed to recover it on the 2-yard line. San Diego then drove inside the Steelers red zone where Rolf Benirschke made a 25-yard field goal to cut the score to 7–3. Pittsburgh responded with a 40-yard reception by receiver Jim Smith that set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Bradshaw near the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Brooks' 15-yard touchdown cut the score to 14–10. Later on, Fouts' 33-yard completion to Wes Chandler set up his 10-yard touchdown pass to Eric Sievers to give the Chargers a 17–14 lead. The Steelers had a chance to tie or retake the lead with a drive into San Diego territory just before halftime, but Chargers safety Bruce Laird made a clutch interception to prevent them from scoring.\nBradshaw threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bennie Cunningham in the third quarter, and later a 9-yard touchdown pass to Stallworth that gave the Steelers a 28–17 lead three plays into the fourth quarter. But this would be the end of his success as he completed only three of his next 11 passes in the final quarter. The next time Pittsburgh had the ball, cornerback Jeff Allen intercepted Bradshaw's pass and returned it eight yards to the Steelers 29 yard line. Mel Blount intercepted a pass in the end zone on the second play of the ensuing drive, but it was eliminated by a holding penalty on linebacker Jack Ham. Five plays later, Fouts cut the score to 28–24 with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Winslow. Following six consecutive handoffs by Bradshaw, San Diego got the ball back on their own 36-yard line due to a 20-yard punt by John Goodson with four minutes left in the game. Four runs by Muncie moved the ball 33 yards to a third and 7 situation on the Steelers 12-yard line. On the next play, Fouts connected with Winslow on a screen pass, and the tight end took it all the way to the end zone for the game winning score with less than a minute left on the clock.\nThis marked Bradshaw's final appearance at Three Rivers Stadium. He sat out nearly all of the 1983 season with an elbow injury, appearing in just one half of a late-season game against the Jets in what turned out to be their final game at Shea Stadium. The game was also the final one of the career of Hall of Fame linebacker Jack Ham.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Chargers and Steelers.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 30, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 17.\nThe Cowboys had 445 yards of total offense and 29 first downs, while their defense held Buccaneers quarterback Doug Williams, playing in his final game in a Bucs uniform, to just eight of 28 completions for 113 yards and intercepted him three times. Dallas running back Tony Dorsett rushed for 110 yards, while kicker Rafael Septién made three field goals.\nTwo first quarter field goals from Septién gave Dallas an early 6–0 lead before Tampa Bay converted two turnovers into 10 points. First, quarterback Danny White lost a fumble that was recovered in mid air by Bucs linebacker Hugh Green, who took off for a 60-yard touchdown return. The Cowboys responded with a drive to the Tampa Bay 38, but on third down, safety Mark Cotney intercepted White's pass and returned it 50 yards to set up Bill Capece's 32-yard field goal.\nDallas countered with a touchdown on a 6-yard pass from White to Ron Springs, making the score 13-10 going into halftime. They upped their lead to 16–10 in the third quarter on a 19-yard Septién field goal. Tampa Bay responded with an 80-yard drive to retake the lead, 17–16, on Williams' short pass to Gordon Jones, who took it 49 yards to the end zone. But in the fourth quarter, Bucs guard Charley Hannah was penalized 10 yards for an illegal block and then drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for arguing the call with officials, pushing Tampa Bay back to their own 11-yard line. On the next play, rookie defensive back Monty Hunter intercepted Williams' pass and returned it 19 yards for a touchdown, putting Dallas back in front at 23–17. 10 minutes later, the Cowboys put the game away with White's 10-yard touchdown pass to Timmy Newsome.\nThis was Tampa Bay's last playoff game until 1997, by which time the Buccaneers replaced their orange uniforms. From 1983 to 1996, they suffered 14 consecutive losing seasons, 13 of which saw Tampa Bay lose 10 or more games.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Buccaneers and Cowboys. Dallas won the only previous meeting.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 30, Atlanta Falcons 24.\nThe Vikings outgained the Falcons in total yards 378–235, but still needed a last second touchdown to win the game. Down by one point with six minutes remaining, they drove 72 yards to score on Ted Brown's game-winning touchdown run with 1:44 left in the game, and then sealed the win with John Turner's interception on the Falcons ensuing possession.\nAtlanta scored after the opening series when Vikings punter Greg Coleman fumbled the snap. Coleman recovered the ball and managed to punt it, but linebacker Paul Davis blocked the kick and his teammate Doug Rogers recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Minnesota took advantage of a 25-yard pass interference penalty against Falcons safety Tom Pridemore by scoring with Rick Danmeier's 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 7–3.\nIn the second quarter, the Vikings took a 10–7 lead with a 7-play, 82-yard drive. Quarterback Tommy Kramer completed a 25-yard pass to Sammy White on the possession, and finished it with an 11-yard pass to White in the end zone. The Falcons responded with a drive deep into Vikings territory, but Turner put an end to that by intercepting Steve Bartkowski's pass at the Minnesota 2-yard line. With 30 seconds left in the half, Minnesota increased their lead to 13–7 with a 30-yard Danmeier field goal that was set up by Rufus Bess' 20-yard punt return and Brown's 14-yard run.\nAtlanta finished the half with just three completions, while Brown had been temporarily knocked out of the game with a sore shoulder and Turner had been taken to a hospital for X-rays after twisting his ankle. Despite this, both players ended up returning to the game.\nThe Falcons started off the third quarter with an 8-play, 71-yard drive, including Bartkowski's passes to Floyd Hodge and Alfred Jenkins for gains of 25 and 22 yards. Faced with fourth down on the Vikings 17-yard line, Atlanta managed to fool the Minnesota defense with a fake field goal play. Backup quarterback Mike Moroski, the holder on field goal plays, took the snap and started run right, but then pitched the ball to kicker Mick Luckhurst, who raced 17 yards for a touchdown (the only rush attempt of his career) to give his team a 14–13 lead. The situation got even better for Atlanta just two minutes later when safety Bob Glazebrook intercepted Kramer's pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. However, the Vikings managed to cut their deficit down to one score before the end of the third quarter with a 70-yard drive that included Kramer's 18-yard completion to tight end Joe Senser. Danmeier finished off the series with a 39-yard field goal, making the score 21-16 going into the final quarter.\nThe Vikings retook the lead in the fourth quarter with a 61-yard drive that included Brown's 3-yard run on fourth and inches and ended with Kramer's 11-yard touchdown throw to receiver Sam McCullum, going up 23–21. But Atlanta stormed right back on a 50-yard drive, featuring a 30-yard reception by Jenkins, to score on a 41-yard Luckhurst field goal.\nNow down 24–23 with six minutes left in regulation, Minnesota put together a 72-yard drive for the game winning score. Brown had runs of 11 and 10 yards along the way, while Kramer completed a 19-yard pass to receiver Terry LeCount. On the last play, Brown scored a 5-yard touchdown run to put his team up 30–24 with 1:44 left in the game. Atlanta still had one last chance to drive for a winning touchdown, but after reaching the Vikings 45, Turner intercepted a pass from Bartkowski, enabling the Vikings to run out the clock.\nKramer completed 20 of 34 passes for 253 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 13 yards. Bartkowski completed just 9 of 24 passes for 134 yards and was intercepted twice, both times by Turner, who had a hospital trip between them. Bess returned five punts for 65 yards. The Vikings fumbled the ball four times during the game, but recovered each one. Atlanta would not return to the playoffs until the 1991 season.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Falcons and Vikings.\nSecond Round playoffs.\nSaturday, January 15, 1983.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 21, Minnesota Vikings 7.\n33-year-old running back John Riggins led the Redskins to a victory with 185 rushing yards on 37 carries (both career highs) and a touchdown.\nWashington scored their 21 points in the game's first 20 minutes. On their opening drive, Riggins gained 34 yards on seven carries as the team drove 66 yards to score on Joe Theismann's 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Don Warren. Two possessions later the Redskins drove 71 yards, including Theismann's 46-yard completion to Alvin Garrett on a flea flicker play, and scored on a 2-yard touchdown run by Riggins on fourth down and inches with one minute left in the quarter. At this point, the Vikings had five total yards, no first downs, and held the ball for only two minutes.\nThe Vikings cut a 14–0 Redskins lead in half early in the second quarter, scoring on Ted Brown's 18-yard touchdown run. But Washington stormed right back to score on Theismann's 18-yard touchdown pass to Garrett.\nThere would be no more scoring for the rest of the game, despite many opportunities for both teams. Vikings kicker Rick Danmeier missed a 38-yard field goal, while Washington's Mark Moseley also had two misses, from 47 and 39 yards. Moseley, who had become the first kicker to win the NFL MVP award during the year, finished this game having made a total of one of his last five attempts, though his 39-yard miss only occurred after his 29-yard field goal was wiped out by a penalty on teammate Rich Milot.\nIn the second half, the Vikings had drives to the Washington 39, 28, and 15-yard lines, but failed to score each time. They ended up punting on the drive to the 39, while the other two both ended with failed fourth down conversion attempts, including Redskins' lineman Tony McGee's sack on quarterback Tommy Kramer on fourth and 7 from the 15 that essentially put the game away in the fourth quarter.\nIn the closing moments of the game, fans at RFK Stadium began chanting \"We Want Dallas\" indicating their ideal choice of opponent for the NFC Championship Game. They would get their wish. Theismann completed 17 of 23 passes for 213 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Kramer completed 18 of 39 passes for 252 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Vikings and Redskins. Minnesota won both previous meetings.\nAFC: New York Jets 17, Los Angeles Raiders 14.\nScott Dierking scored the Jets' winning touchdown with 3:45 left to upset the top-seeded Raiders. New York linebacker Lance Mehl subsequently intercepted two passes from Jim Plunkett in the final minutes to seal the victory. Jets running back Freeman McNeil rushed for 105 yards and caught a pass for 11. Wesley Walker caught seven passes for 169 yards and a touchdown. On defense, New York held Raiders running back Marcus Allen, the NFL's 4th leading rusher, to just 36 yards on 15 carries.\nWalker's 20-yard touchdown catch and Pat Leahy's 30-yard field goal gave New York a 10–0 lead before Los Angeles stormed back, taking a 14–10 lead on Allen's 3-yard touchdown run and a 57-yard scoring reception by Malcolm Barnwell. Late in the fourth quarter, New York drove 67 yards in six plays, including Richard Todd's 45-yard completion to Walker on the Raiders 1-yard line, where Dierking took the ball into the end zone to give the Jets a 17–14 lead. Their defense seemed to put the game away when Mehl intercepted a pass from Plunkett with slightly over two minutes left on the Raiders ensuing drive. However, Los Angeles defensive end Lyle Alzado forced a fumble from McNeil that linebacker Ted Hendricks recovered to give his team one last chance to drive for a tying score. The Jets defense proved up to the challenge, and Mehl intercepted another Plunkett pass that enabled New York to run out the rest of the clock.\nHendricks finished the game with a sack and two fumble recoveries.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Jets and Raiders. New York won the only prior meeting when the Raiders were based in Oakland and prior to the AFL–NFL merger.\nSunday, January 16, 1983.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 34, San Diego Chargers 13.\nMiami avenged their divisional playoff loss to San Diego in the previous season known as the Epic in Miami with a dominating 34–13 win, racking up 413 yards while holding the Chargers to a season low 247. The Dolphins defense completely shut down Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts, limiting him to just 15 of 34 completions for 194 yards and a touchdown while intercepting him five times. The Dolphins led 27–13 at halftime. Miami quarterback David Woodley, who was benched in the second quarter of the Epic in Miami due to poor performance, redeemed himself by completing 17 of 22 passes for 195 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also scoring a rushing touchdown. The Dolphins converted three first half turnovers, including consecutive fumbled kickoffs, into 17 points.\nGerald Small intercepted Fouts on the game's opening possession and returned the ball 16 yards to San Diego 26-yard line, setting up Woodley's 3-yard touchdown pass to Nat Moore at the end of a five-play drive. Following a punt, Miami increased their lead to 14–0 with Andra Franklin's 3-yard touchdown run at the end of an 89-yard drive. Then kicker Uwe von Schamann recovered a fumble from Hank Bauer on the ensuing kickoff, giving the Dolphins the ball on the Chargers 23, and they scored another touchdown with Woodley's 6-yard pass to tight end Ronnie Lee. On the next kickoff, returner James Brooks lost a fumble that was recovered by Dolphins running back Rich Diana on the San Diego 37, leading to von Schamann's 24-yard field goal that put the Dolphins up 24–0 with 7:45 left in the first half.\nA few minutes later, the Chargers finally caught a break when a short Miami punt and facemask penalty during the return gave them the ball at the Dolphins 28, where Fouts threw a touchdown pass to Charlie Joiner. But the team's miscues continued as Rolf Benirschke missed the extra point. Then on Miami's ensuing drive, Jimmy Cefalo's 53-yard reception led to von Schamann's 23-yard field goal. Still, the Chargers managed to cut the deficit to 27–13 before halftime with a 76-yard drive, 40 yards coming from Dolphins penalties. Chuck Muncie finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run with 22 seconds left in the second quarter.\nMiami lost turnovers of each of their first two drives of the second half; Bruce Laird's interception of a Woodley pass and a fumble by Tony Nathan that was recovered by Chargers linebacker Woodrow Lowe on the San Diego 7-yard line. However, the Chargers could not convert either of them into points, and after moving the ball 47 yards to the Dolphins 36 following the Nathan fumble, Fouts was intercepted by Dolphins safety Glenn Blackwood. Miami converted this turnover into their final score, a 7-yard run by Woodley. Meanwhile, the next three Chargers drives all ended in interceptions; a second pick by Glenn Blackwood, the next by his older brother Lyle Blackwood, and the last by cornerback Don McNeal.\nThis was the final postseason game in the Hall of Fame careers of Chargers stars Dan Fouts, Charlie Joiner, and Kellen Winslow. Joiner's touchdown was his only reception of the game, while Winslow had one for 18. Receiver Wes Chandler, who led the NFL in receiving yards during the season, finished this game with two receptions for 38 yards. Muncie rushed for 62 yards and a touchdown, while also catching six passes for 53. Franklin was the Dolphins top rusher with 96 yards and a touchdown. Nathan rushed for 83 yards and caught eight passes for 55.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chargers and Dolphins. San Diego won the only previous meeting one season ago.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 37, Green Bay Packers 26.\nThe Cowboys scored touchdowns on two 80-yard drives while cornerback Dennis Thurman had three interceptions, including a 39-yard touchdown and one to clinch the victory. Packers quarterback Lynn Dickey threw for a franchise postseason record 332 yards and a touchdown, but his three interceptions were too costly to overcome. Receiver James Lofton caught five passes for 109 yards and a touchdown, and also had a 71-yard touchdown run on a reverse play, which tied the record for longest running play in a playoff game at the time.\nDallas kicker Rafael Septién gave the team a 3–0 lead with a 50-yard field goal on the opening drive of the game. Then Green Bay returner Del Rodgers fumbled the kickoff, which linebacker Jeff Rohrer recovered for the Cowboys, leading to another Septién field goal, this one from 34 yards. By this point, the Cowboys had a 6–0 lead and had run 19 consecutive plays to start the game. Green Bay would not get a first down until 11:31 remained in the second quarter. Still, they managed to take a 7–6 lead with a 74-yard drive to score on Dickey's 6-yard pass to Lofton. Dallas struck back with an 80-yard drive to score on a 2-yard touchdown run by Robert Newhouse. Then with 1:13 left in the half, Thurman's 39-yard interception return gave the Cowboys a 20–7 lead by halftime.\nIn the second half, the Packers mounted a strong comeback attempt, racking up 363 yards and scoring 19 points. Midway through the fourth quarter, Green Bay defensive back Mark Lee's 22-yard interception return for a touchdown cut the Packers deficit to 30–26. But later on, Thurman's third interception set up a 74-yard scoring drive, including a trick play where receiver Drew Pearson took a lateral from Danny White and then threw a 49-yard completion to Tony Hill on the Green Bay 1-yard line. On the next play, Newhouse' second touchdown run put the game away.\nGreen Bay finished the game with a franchise playoff record 466 total yards. The Packers would not play another postseason game until 1993.\nThis would be the final playoff win in Cowboys' coach Tom Landry's career. It would be the Cowboys last playoff victory until 1991. Hill finished the game with 7 receptions for 142 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Packers and Cowboys. Green Bay won both previous meetings.\nConference Championships.\nSaturday, January 22, 1983.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 31, Dallas Cowboys 17.\nThe significance of this NFC Championship Game is that it was the first, and to date, the only time that any Conference Championship game was played on a Saturday, instead of the usual Sunday. As a result of that unusual scheduling, Dallas played on short rest. In their regular season meeting, Dallas had handed Washington their only loss of the year, 24–10, holding running back John Riggins to just 26 rushing yards while sacking quarterback Joe Theismann seven times and intercepting three of his passes. But this game, would turn out quite different as the Redskins sealed the victory by converting two turnovers in the final quarter into 10 points. Although Dallas outgained Washington in total yards 340–260, it wasn't enough to overcome their three turnovers versus none for the Redskins.\nThe Cowboys scored first after a 75-yard drive led to a 27-yard field goal by kicker Rafael Septién. But Washington then scored on a 9-play, 84-yard possession to take the lead. Riggins rushed for 32 yards on the drive, while Theismann capped it off with a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Charlie Brown. In the second quarter, a pair of completions by Theismann and 24 more yards from Riggins moved the Redskins into scoring range, only to have kicker Mark Moseley miss a 27-yard field goal.\nLater on, the Cowboys committed a special teams blunder of their own when rookie kick returner Rod Hill muffed a Jeff Hayes punt and linebacker Monte Coleman recovered it, giving Washington the ball on the Dallas 10-yard line. Four plays later, Riggins scored a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing his team's lead to 14–3.\nWith 23 seconds left in the first half, Cowboys quarterback Danny White suffered a concussion after being hit by Washington's Dexter Manley and was replaced by unknown backup Gary Hogeboom, a three-year veteran who had only thrown eight passes in his career up to that point, for the rest of the game. A short Redskins punt early in the third quarter then set up Hogeboom's 6-yard touchdown toss to Drew Pearson, capping a six-play, 38-yard drive and cutting the score to 14–10. But on the ensuing kickoff, Mike Nelms returned the ball 76 yards down the right sideline to the Dallas 21-yard line. A 22-yard pass from Theismann to Brown was then followed by Riggins' four-yard touchdown run. Hogeboom then responded by leading Dallas on an 84-yard, 14-play drive capped by his 23-yard scoring pass to Butch Johnson, cutting the margin back to 21–17 with 3:25 left in the third quarter.\nDallas threatened to cut the lead further, driving to the Washington 23-yard line early in the fourth quarter, but Septién missed a 42-yard field goal, ending his NFL playoff record streak of consecutive field goal makes at 15. Following a Washington punt, Dallas had the ball at their own 32-yard line, but linebacker Mel Kaufman made a leaping, over-the-shoulder interception that was intended for Cowboys receiver Tony Hill, setting up Moseley's 29-yard field goal that gave the team a 24–17 lead with 6:55 left in regulation. The Cowboys were given the opportunity to drive for the tying touchdown, but then, from the Dallas 20-yard line, Manley tipped Hogeboom's delayed screen pass intended for running back Tony Dorsett, which Redskins defensive tackle Darryl Grant caught and returned it 10 yards for the game-clinching touchdown.\nWhite completed 9 of 15 passes for 113 yards before being knocked out of the game, while Hogeboom completed 14 of 29 passes for 162 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the only playoff game he would play in during his 10-season career. Theismann completed 12 of 20 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. Nelms returned four kickoffs for 142 yards and two punts for 14.\nRiggins, who ran nine straight times to help Washington run out the clock in the final quarter, finished the game with 140 rushing yards and two touchdowns, setting an NFL record with three consecutive 100-yard postseason games. \"I've waited a long time for this,\" he said after the game. \"I'm really thrilled. To tell you the truth, after the strike, I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue the season. I was ready to pack my bags and head for Kansas. Boy, what a mistake that would have been.\"\nAfter appearing in 10 of the previous 13 NFC Championship games, this would be Dallas' last appearance until 1992.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Redskins. Washington won the only prior meeting.\nSunday, January 23, 1983.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 14, New York Jets 0.\nOn a wet, muddy field (the Jets complained about the Dolphins' decision not to place the tarp over the field before the game), the Dolphins defense held Jets quarterback Richard Todd to only 15 completions in 37 attempts for 103 yards; he threw five interceptions. Linebacker A. J. Duhe led Miami to a victory with three interceptions, scoring a 35-yard touchdown and setting up the other Dolphins score. Miami held the Jets to 139 total yards.\nBoth teams started off with drives that would set the tone for the rest of the game. New York got the ball first and drove to midfield before losing it when Glenn Blackwood intercepted Todd's pass. On the first play after the turnover, Miami gave the ball right back with a pass that was picked off by Jets safety Ken Schroy. In the second quarter, Dolphins quarterback David Woodley broke free for a 17-yard run to his 39-yard line, which turned out to be the longest run of the day for either team. However, running back Tony Nathan lost a fumble on the next play, though the Jets still failed to get any points with a possession starting at the Miami 41.\nLate in the second quarter, it seemed Miami would finally break the scoreless tie when their cornerback Don McNeal blocked a punt from Chuck Ramsey, allowing the Dolphins to get the ball on the New York 20-yard line. But with time running out, Schroy intercepted his second pass of the day and the game remained scoreless at halftime.\nEarly in the third quarter, Blackwood recorded his second interception, only to see it wiped out by a defensive holding penalty. But the next play fared no better for New York, as Todd threw a pass that bounced out of the hands of running back Mike Augustyniak and was intercepted by Duhe. A few plays later, Nathan appeared to lose a fumble, but officials ruled him down by contact before he lost the ball. Another key play on the drive occurred when Woodley completed a 13-yard pass to Duriel Harris on third down and 3. Safety Darrol Ray vehemently protested the call of a completed pass, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that moved the ball to the Jets 7-yard line, and running back Woody Bennett ran the ball into the end zone on the next play.\nLater in the third quarter, Duhe intercepted another pass from Todd, this one on the Jets 41-yard line, but his team couldn't move the ball and had to punt. Two minutes into the fourth quarter, Duhe recorded his third interception of the day, and this time took it 35 yards for a touchdown. The Dolphins 14–0 lead turned out to be more than enough, as New York never mounted a serious scoring threat for the rest of the game.\nBoth teams combined for nine turnovers, 19 punts, and just 437 total yards.\nThis would be the last time the Dolphins would shut out the Jets until week 5 of the 2020 season when the Dolphins shut out the Jets 24–0.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Jets and Dolphins.\nSuper Bowl XVII: Washington Redskins 27, Miami Dolphins 17.\nThis was the second Super Bowl meeting between the Dolphins and Redskins. Miami won the only prior meeting."

        "title": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club",
        "text": "The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC), also known as the All England Club, based at Church Road, Wimbledon, London, England, is a private members' club. It is best known as the venue for the Wimbledon Championships, the only Grand Slam tennis event still held on grass. Initially an amateur event that occupied club members and their friends for a few days each summer, the championships have become far more prominent than the club itself. However, it still operates as a members' tennis club.\nThe club has 375 full members, about 100 temporary playing members, and a number of honorary members. To become a full or temporary member, an applicant must obtain letters of support from four existing full members, two of whom must have known the applicant for at least three years. The name is then added to the candidates' list. Honorary members are elected from time to time by the club's committee. Membership carries with it the right to purchase two tickets for each day of the Wimbledon Championships. In addition to this all champions are invited to become members.\nCatherine, Princess of Wales, has been the patron of the club since 2016 (then the Duchess of Cambridge) when the then monarch Elizabeth II stepped back from a number of royal patronages.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded by six gentlemen at the offices of \"The Field\" on 23 July 1868 at the height of a croquet craze as the \"All England Croquet Club,\" and held its first croquet competition in 1870. Its original ground was situated off Worple Road, Wimbledon. Croquet was very popular there until the then-infant sport of lawn tennis (a game introduced by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so prior, and originally called \"Sphairistikè\") was introduced in 1875, when one lawn was set aside for this purpose. The first tennis gentlemen's championship in singles was held in July 1877, when the club changed its name to \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\". That year at Wimbledon service was underarm. The champion, Spencer Gore, opined that \"Lawn tennis will never rank among our great games.\" In 1878 the height of the net was altered to at the posts and at the centre. In 1882, croquet was dropped from the name, as tennis had become the main activity of the club. But in 1899 it was restored to the club's name for sentimental reasons, and the club's name became \"The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club\".\nIn 1884, the club added Ladies' Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles, and then in 1913 Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles. For the 1908 Summer Olympics, the venue hosted the Grass Courts tennis events. The early club colours were found to be almost identical to those of the Royal Marines, so they were changed in 1909 to the present club colours of dark green and purple. The popularity of Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen was largely responsible for forcing the club to move to larger grounds at its present site in Church Road, Wimbledon, in 1922, where its first championship was \"plagued by rain each day\".\nThe current Centre Court dates from that year. It has been improved and extended on several occasions. Most recently a sliding roof was added in time for the 2009 Championships. In 1924 the old No.1 Court opened on the west side of Centre Court. During World War II The Championships were suspended but the club remained open with a much smaller staff, and was used for fire and ambulance services, British Home Guard, and a decontamination unit, and troops stationed nearby drilled on the main concourse. At 5:20 p.m. on 11 October 1940, five 50-pound German bombs struck the grounds, demolishing 1,200 seats in Centre Court. The old No.1 Court was replaced with the current No.1 Court in 1997, and the Broadcast Centre was built at the same time. Shortly afterwards, the Millennium Building, which houses facilities for players, press, officials and members, was built on the site of the old No.1 Court.\nThe Church Road site initially extended only as far north as Centre Court. In 1967 the All England Club purchased to the north. This was leased to the New Zealand Sports and Social Club and became known as Aorangi Park (Aorangi means \"Cloud Piercer\", and is the Māori part of Aoraki / Mount Cook; \"Aorangi\" is the standard Māori spelling and \"Aoraki\" is used in the Māori dialect in the vicinity of the mountain). It is most commonly known as \"Henman Hill\" because of the popularity of former British tennis player Tim Henman. Initially the only use that the All England Club itself made of this new land was for car parking during The Championships, but in 1981 the New Zealanders' lease was terminated, and the club has developed most of the area for its own purposes.\nThe All England Club, through its subsidiary The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues debentures to tennis fans every five years to raise funds for capital expenditure. The original debentures were issued in 1920. Each debenture provides a pair of tickets for each day of the tournament for five years. Only debenture holders are legally permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties.\nIn 2011, the club established another subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited, trading as AELTC, and transferred all of its assets relating to The Championships to that entity on 1 August of that year. Since that time, the club's activities have been conducted separately from those of The Championships.\nThe club was the venue for the tennis event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nIn June 2020, Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since World War II due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wimbledon was cancelled several times during the wars: in World War I between 1915 and 1918 and World War II between 1940 and 1945.\nFrom June 2022, Wimbledon was played on a Sunday for the first time since 2016, as a replacement for the traditional rest day.\nIn July 2023, Debbie Jevans became the first chairwoman of the board, succeeding Ian Hewitt at the end of the 2023 Wimbledon Championships.\n1913 suffragette terror attack.\nA failed attempt was made to destroy the grounds in 1913, as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign. During the years before the First World War, suffragettes, as part of their campaign for women's votes, carried out politically motivated arson and bombings across the country. On 27 February 1913, a suffragette woman \"between the ages of 30–35\" was arrested within the grounds, after being spotted by a groundsman climbing over a hedge at around midnight. She was found to have on her paraffin and wood shavings, for the purpose of setting fires in the grounds. The woman refused to give her name or any information and was later sentenced to two months' imprisonment.\nFacilities.\nThe club currently has 18 tournament grass courts, eight American clay courts, two acrylic courts, and six indoor courts. There are also 22 Aorangi Park grass courts, which serve as competitors' practice courts before and during The Championships. The grass courts can be used from May until September. The grass has been cut to 8 mm since 1995, and 100% perennial ryegrass has been used for its strength since 2001 (prior to that, it was 70% perennial rye and 30% creeping red fescue). The courts are renovated in September, using nine tons of grass seed annually.\nThe largest court is Centre Court, which hosts the finals of the main singles and doubles events at The Championships. There is an inscription above the entryway to Centre Court which reads \"If you can meet with triumph and disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same\" – lines from Rudyard Kipling's poem \"If—\". This court also served as the main venue for the tennis events at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nInitially, the courts were arranged in such a way that the principal court was situated in the middle with the others arranged around it; hence the title \"Centre Court\".\nThe present Centre Court, built in 1922 upon the move of the club, was not actually in the centre at the time it was built, but as new courts were added in later years it became a more accurate description. It currently seats 15,000 – expanded from 14,000 following redevelopment in 2007–08 (spatially, the expansion is greater than those numbers imply, as seats have been widened), and (as of 2009) is the fourth-largest tennis stadium in the world. The Club installed a retractable roof on Centre Court which was completed in May 2009. It is a \"folding concertina\" made of 5,200 square metres of a translucent waterproof fabric that allows natural light to reach the grass, and opens or closes in under 10 minutes. Redevelopment work commenced in 2006, and Centre Court had no roof at all in place for the duration of the 2007 Championships.\nThe other \"show court\" is No.1 Court, built in 1997, which holds around 11,500 people and occasionally plays host to Davis Cup matches (Centre Court usually being reserved for the Wimbledon Championships). It has been fitted with a retractable roof similar to Centre Court and was unveiled at a special ceremony on 19 May 2019.\nA new No.2 Court with 4,000 seats was first used at the 2009 Championships. The old No.2 Court was renamed No.3 Court in 2009, and was rebuilt after the 2009 Championships. The grounds underwent major renovation as part of the Wimbledon Master Plan.\nIn December 2018 the club agreed a £65 million compensation package with the members of the adjacent Wimbledon Park Golf Club to cut short their lease on the ground in order to expand.\nThe club also houses the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum.\nThe Championships.\nAmong the features that differentiate The Wimbledon Championships from the other Grand Slams are that they are played on grass courts, they require the players to wear white, and until 2021, the middle Sunday was a day off (though sometimes – in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016 – poor weather meant play needed to take place). Balls were also white until 1986. The winner of the Gentlemen's singles at The Championships receives a gold trophy inscribed with the words: \"The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Champion of the World\".\nThe Championships attract attendance of around 450,000 people. Ninety per cent of the financial surplus that the Club generates from running The Championships is used to develop tennis in Great Britain; between 1998 and 2016 the surplus ranged from £25–40 million per year. The Championships are run by a Committee of Management that consists of 12 club members and seven nominees of The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\nIn 2003, a long-standing tradition of Centre Court players bowing or curtseying to the Royal Box was discontinued by order of the Duke of Kent, with the exception of the Queen or the Prince of Wales's attendance. Andy Murray and Jarkko Nieminen elected to bow when the Queen visited The Championships for their 2010 second round match, as did Roger Federer and Fabio Fognini at their second round match, watched by the Prince of Wales, in 2012. In December 2016, it was announced that the then Duchess of Cambridge would succeed the Queen as Patron of The AELTC and The Championships, effective January 2017.\nControversies.\nBlack players were not allowed to play at the club until 1951, and Jews were not admitted until 1952. According to Angela Buxton, the Jewish former British Wimbledon doubles champion, it also has led to her exclusion. Buxton said in 2004, reflecting on the fact that the All England Club, almost 50 years after Buxton's 1956 Wimbledon triumph with Althea Gibson, had still not invited Buxton to join: \"I think the anti-Semitism is still there. The mere fact that I'm not a member is a full sentence that speaks for itself.\" Buxton told \"New York Post\" reporter Marc Berman that she had been on the \"waiting list\" since she applied in the 1950s. \"I wish it still wasn't such an elite sport,\" Buxton told Berman. \"I wish we could bring it down to a common baseline. It's going that way. It's still not there.\"\nIn 2006, Chairman Tim Phillips said that paying men and women equal prize money at The Championships was something they \"fundamentally don't think would be fair on the men\" (due to men playing best-of-five sets, and women only best-of-three). The Championships introduced equal prize money the following year."

        "text": "The IMG Academy Junior World Golf Championships are held in San Diego, California, United States each year, currently in July and conducted by the San Diego Junior Golf Association. They include tournaments for six age groups ranging from under-6 to 15–17 and for both boys and girls. Each age group plays at a separate course, ranging from a par-3 course for the youngest to Torrey Pines for the 15–17s, which is also the venue for the Farmers Insurance Open on the PGA Tour and the site of the 2008 U.S. Open.\nThe event was founded in 1968. The inaugural tournament numbered 475 entrants from 20 U.S. States and six other countries. By 2003 there were 1,040 participants from 43 U.S States and 45 other countries. Qualifying events are held in the U.S. and elsewhere. However, European golf has largely opted out of participation; of around 30 countries that hold qualifying events, The British Junior Golf Tour in UK offer qualifying events in Europe. In 2005 the top tens of the 15–17 boys' and girls' tournaments featured golfers from ten different countries between them. The most notable trend in the results in recent years is a dramatic increase in the number of wins and top-ten finishes by boys and girls from East Asia. This trend has already translated to LPGA Tour level, but not so much onto the PGA Tour.\nBeginning with the 2015 event, IMG Academy became the event's title sponsor. \nPast boys' champions include Notah Begay III, Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Corey Pavin, Nick Price, Craig Stadler, David Toms, Jason Day and Tiger Woods. 1984 was a vintage year, with Toms winning the 15–17 event, Els winning the 13–14s (with Mickelson finishing second), and Woods winning the 9–10s (despite still being age 8). More than any other golfer, Tiger Woods has won 6 of these championships.\nPast girls' champions include Amy Alcott, Brandie Burton, Lorena Ochoa, and Jennifer Rosales."

        "title": "1996–97 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1996 season began on December 28, 1996. The postseason tournament concluded with the Green Bay Packers defeating the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI, 35–21, on January 26, 1997, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nThe Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars, each in just their second year of existence, not only qualified for the playoffs for the first time, but they also both advanced to their respective conference championship games.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, ABC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games, then NBC broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games. Fox televised the rest of the NFC games and Super Bowl XXXI (their first ever Super Bowl broadcast since becoming the NFC network in 1994).\nThe 1996-97 playoffs marked the first time that ABC employed ESPN’s NFL announce team for its Wild Card Weekend coverage; Mike Patrick replaced Brent Musburger on play-by-play with Joe Theismann replacing Dick Vermeil as analyst. Musburger and Vermeil, who at the time comprised ABC’s #2 college football broadcast team, had called one of the two Wild Card matchups every year since the playoffs expanded in 1990.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 28, 1996.\nAFC: Jacksonville Jaguars 30, Buffalo Bills 27.\nThe second-year Jaguars forced four turnovers, racked up three sacks, and outgained Buffalo in total yards 409–308 to earn their first playoff win. After trading points back and forth all day, almost drive for drive, Jaguars safety Chris Hudson would make a decisive hit on Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, knocking him out of the game and forcing a fumble that his team would convert into the game-winning score.\nJacksonville was forced to punt on their opening drive, and Russell Copeland returned the ball 16 yards to the Jags' 43-yard line, setting up Kelly's 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Thurman Thomas. But later in the quarter, Jacksonville defensive end Clyde Simmons intercepted a shovel pass intended for Thomas and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown to tie the game. Buffalo stormed right back with a 10-play, 68-yard drive that ended with Thomas' 2-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–7. However, Jacksonville running back Natrone Means's 62-yard carry on their next drive moved the ball to the Bills' 5-yard line. The drive stalled there, but Mike Hollis kicked a 27-yard field goal to make the score 14–10 at the end of the first quarter.\nThe Bills drove to the Jags' 2-yard line on their first drive of the second quarter, but came up empty when Kelly was stuffed for no gain by Jeff Lageman while trying to convert a fourth and 1 on a quarterback sneak. Jacksonville then stormed to their first lead of the day with quarterback Mark Brunell completing a 47-yard pass to tight end Pete Mitchell before Means took off for a 30-yard touchdown burst, giving them a 17–14 advantage. However, Eric Moulds returned the ensuing kickoff 57 yards to the Jags' 42-yard line, setting up a 33-yard Steve Christie field goal to tie the game at 17. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the Buffalo 36, but on the last play of the half, Brunell was intercepted by Thomas Smith.\nMoulds returned the second-half kickoff 26 yards to the Bills' 38-yard line, where the Bills went on to retake the lead with Christie's 47-yard field goal. But after a few punts, Jacksonville managed to tie it again with an 11-play, 62-yard drive that included a 27-yard catch by receiver Keenan McCardell and ended with a 24-yard field goal by Hollis.\nOn the second play of the fourth quarter, Jeff Burris picked off Brunell's pass and returned it 38 yards for a touchdown to give his team a 27–20 lead. Jacksonville countered right back, moving the ball 65 yards in 10 plays. McCardell caught two passes for 39 yards on the drive, while Means kept it going with a 2-yard run on fourth and 1. Brunell finished the drive with a 2-yard toss to Jimmy Smith that tied the game at 27. On Buffalo's next drive, Hudson made a devastating hit on Kelly, knocking him out of the game and forcing a fumble that was recovered by cornerback Aaron Beasley on the Jags' 42-yard line. Brunell then completed a pair of passes to Smith and McCardell for gains of 14 and 11 yards to set up Hollis's 45-yard field goal, putting them back in front for good at 30–27. The Bills offense, now led by Todd Collins, were unable to move the ball on any of their remaining drives, and during the game's final seconds, Tony Brackens forced a fumble while sacking Collins that linebacker Eddie Robinson recovered to seal the win.\nMeans finished the game with 175 rushing yards. Simmons finished with two sacks and an interception returned for a touchdown. Bills receiver Quinn Early caught nine passes for 122 yards. Moulds returned five kickoffs for 142 yards. This was the final game of Kelly's Hall of Fame career, and the final playoff game for Bills Hall of Fame coach Marv Levy as well.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Jaguars and the Bills.\nA fictionalized version of the game was played during the final season of the ABC series \"Coach\", with the Orlando Breakers as the Jaguars' stand-in that also made the playoffs in their second year of existence; however, the Breakers lost to the Bills, which ended their season.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 40, Minnesota Vikings 15.\nDallas outgained the Vikings in total yards 438–268, plays 78–44, and time of possession 42:03–17:57. They also forced six turnovers and scored on five first half possessions to win the game.\nDallas scored first on a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman completed four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards and finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson and appeared to be on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked the ball out of his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10–0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Cornerback Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24–0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.\nThe Dallas dominance would continue as Sanders returned an interception 22 yards to the Vikings 29 to set up a 31-yard Boniol field goal. Even Orlando Thomas's interception of an Aikman pass ended up going against the Vikings as Thomas lost the ball while being tackled by Walker and tight end Eric Bjornson got it back for the Cowboys. This led to Boniol's 22-yard field goal, giving Dallas a 30–0 lead at the end of the half.\nIn the second half, Minnesota drove 47 yards and scored on a 30-yard pass from Johnson to Cris Carter. But this was answered by Dallas, who subsequently moved the ball 80 yards in 16 plays to go up 37–7 on Smith's 1-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, Dallas linebacker Broderick Thomas forced a turnover by sacking Johnson on fourth down, giving Dallas the ball on the Vikings 39, which led to another Boniol field goal. On the ensuing drive, Johnson's 50-yard completion to Qadry Ismail set up the final score of the game on Johnson's 2-yard touchdown run.\nSmith rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching four passes for 26 yards. Irvin caught eight passes for 103 yards. Teague had five tackles, two forced fumbles, and an interception return for a touchdown. This was the last time the Cowboys won a playoff game until January 9, 2010, when they beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the 34–14, and their last playoff win at Texas Stadium. Meanwhile, the Vikings fell to 0–4 in the playoffs under coach Dennis Green.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Vikings and Cowboys. Dallas won three of the prior four meetings.\nSunday, December 29, 1996.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 42, Indianapolis Colts 14.\nThe Steelers blew a 13-point lead in the first half but scored 29 unanswered points in the second half. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh held the Colts to 146 total yards of offense, while gaining 407 yards for themselves (236 on the ground).\nPittsburgh drove 51 yards in eight plays, including a 30-yard reception by receiver Charles Johnson, to score on Norm Johnson's 29-yard field goal on their first drive. After the Colts' next drive, Steelers receiver Jahine Arnold returned their punt 36 yards to the Colts' 31-yard line. One play later, Mike Tomczak completed a 20-yard pass to Charles Johnson at the 8. Backup quarterback Kordell Stewart, who was routinely used by the team in short-yardage situations, eventually finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Steelers a 10–0 lead with 4:55 left in the first quarter. Following another Colts punt, Pittsburgh increased their lead to 13–0 with Norm Johnson's 50-yard field goal 10 seconds into the second quarter.\nPittsburgh seemed to be taking control of the game, but with 4:35 left in the half, Tomczak threw a short pass intended for Ernie Mills that was too far behind the receiver. Cornerback Eugene Daniel intercepted the ball and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown. On the Steelers next possession, Tomczak threw an interception to safety Ray McElroy on the Colts 40-yard line. On the next play, Jim Harbaugh completed a 48-yard pass to Marvin Harrison at the Steelers 12, and he eventually converted a third and 7 situation with a 9-yard touchdown pass to receiver Aaron Bailey, giving the team a 14–13 lead with 31 seconds left before halftime.\nHowever, the Steelers dominated the rest of the game. They started out the second half with a 16-play, 91-yard possession that ate 9:30 off the clock. Tomczak completed 5/5 passes for 37 yards on the drive, while Jerome Bettis caught one of them and rushed for 42 yards on eight carries, the last a 1-yard touchdown run. Then Stewart completed a 2-point conversion pass to tight end John Farquhar, giving the team a 21–14 lead. Harbaugh was intercepted by Levon Kirkland on the next drive, and after a Steelers punt, running back Marshall Faulk fumbled a pitch from him which safety Carnell Lake recovered on the Indy 18-yard line. Five plays later, Bettis scored another 1-yard touchdown run to give the Steelers a 28–14 lead less than a minute into the fourth quarter.\nStewart ended up as the Steelers' QB for the rest of the game. He finished with just one pass attempt, but his 24-yard run on a quarterback draw set up running back Jon Witman's 31-yard touchdown play. Stewart added a 3-yard touchdown run with 3:10 left in the game, making the final score 42–14. It was the second straight year the Steelers eliminated the Colts from the playoffs.\nBettis rushed for 102 yards and two touchdowns (his 11th 100-yard game of the year), while also catching a pass for four yards. Johnson caught five passes for 109 yards. Neither starting quarterback had a big day. Tomczak completed 13 of 21 passes for 176 yards, with two interceptions and no touchdowns. Harbaugh completed 12 of 32 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown with one pick. He was also sacked four times, three by Chad Brown.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Colts and Steelers. Pittsburgh had won all three prior meetings.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 14, Philadelphia Eagles 0.\nAlthough they gained more yards than the 49ers, the Eagles were shut out in a rain-soaked, muddy game with 62 miles per hour winds. San Francisco won 14–0 in what coach George Seifert called \"the swampy tundra of Candlestick.\" (A reference to John Facenda's famous description of Lambeau Field as \"the frozen tundra\") Despite the poor weather, San Francisco finished the game without losing any turnovers.\nKicker Gary Anderson missed a 40-yard field goal attempt on Philadelphia's first possession. In the second quarter, San Francisco quarterback Steve Young completed 6/7 passes for 60 yards on a 74-yard drive and finished it off with a 9-yard touchdown run. The Eagles then reached the San Francisco 8-yard line, but quarterback Ty Detmer threw an interception to Marquez Pope. The 49ers were forced to punt on their next drive, and Philadelphia advanced to the San Francisco 5-yard line. However, 49ers defensive end Roy Barker intercepted Detmer with 43 seconds left in the half, and the Eagles would never seriously threaten again.\nDetmer was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring injury, and his replacement Mark Rypien completed only five of 12 passes for 77 yards, including an interception to Tim McDonald on the last play of the game. Meanwhile, a one handed 36-yard reception by 49ers receiver Jerry Rice set up the final score of the game with his 3-yard touchdown catch from Young, finishing off a 61-yard drive in the third quarter. This was the lowest scoring wild-card playoff game in NFL history.\nYoung finished the game 14/21 for 161 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 65 yards and another score. 49ers defensive tackle Bryant Young had two sacks.\nThis would be the last time the Eagles lost in the Wild Card game until 2009.\nThe two teams met again in the 2022 NFC Championship game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Eagles and 49ers.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 4, 1997.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 35, San Francisco 49ers 14.\nThe Packers defense forced five turnovers en route to victory, while Desmond Howard's key punt returns enabled the Packers to jump to a 14–0 lead after only three offensive plays. On his first punt return, Howard ran 71 yards for a touchdown. At the end of the next series, he returned punt 46 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line to set up quarterback Brett Favre's 4-yard touchdown to wide receiver Andre Rison.\nEarly in the second quarter, cornerback Craig Newsome's interception set up the Packers third touchdown of the day. Newsome fumbled the ball while being hit during the interception return, but his teammate Sean Jones recovered the ball on the 49ers 15-yard line. Three plays later, Edgar Bennett's touchdown run increased the Packers lead to 21–0.\nTwo Green Bay turnovers enabled San Francisco to mount a comeback attempt. First, a 49ers punt bounced into Packers safety Chris Hayes and was recovered by San Francisco's Curtis Buckley at the Green Bay 26-yard line. Six plays later, backup quarterback Elvis Grbac (who had replaced injured starter Steve Young) threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Terry Kirby with 24 seconds left in the half. Then in a odd error, Howard did not come out of the locker room in time for the second-half kickoff, and no one on the team noticed. With only 10 Green Bay players on the field to receive the second-half kickoff and no one in the returner position, the kickoff bounced into the ground and Iheanyi Uwaezuoke recovered it for San Francisco on the Green Bay 4-yard line. On the next play, Grbac's 4-yard touchdown run cut the score to 21–14.\nHowever, the Packers marched 72 yards for another touchdown, in which a fumble by Bennett was recovered in the end zone by wide receiver Antonio Freeman. Later on, with 5:31 left in the game, Kirby lost a fumble while being tackled by Green Bay defensive back Mike Prior, and Hayes recovered the ball on the 49ers' 32-yard line. Six plays later, Bennett scored his second touchdown of the game on an 11-yard run to close out the scoring.\nBecause the weather dipped in and out of freezing, causing both rain and snow, the field got extremely muddy as the game went on. The \"Green Bay Press-Gazette\" called the game the \"Mud Bowl.\" Neither team had much success moving the ball on offense due to the field conditions. The Packers, who averaged over 345 yards per game during the season, gained just 210 yards, while the 49ers managed only 196. The longest completion of the day was an 18-yard reception by Freeman. Bennett was one of the top players of the day with 80 rushing yards and two touchdowns, along with two receptions for 14 yards.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the 49ers and Packers with the first happening the previous year, which Green Bay won.\nAFC: Jacksonville Jaguars 30, Denver Broncos 27.\nThe wild-card Jaguars, who had barely made the playoffs with a 9–7 record by winning their last five games of the season (including their final one when Atlanta Falcons kicker Morten Andersen missed a last-second potential game-winning 30-yard field goal), overcame a 12-point deficit by racking up 443 yards (including 202 on the ground) and scoring on six consecutive possessions to upset the Broncos, who had finished the season with an NFL best 13–3 record (and had rested most of their starters over the last three games after clinching the #1 AFC seed at 12–1) and were favored to win by over 14 points. The Broncos' loss meant that for the second consecutive year the AFC's top seed was eliminated in the divisional round.\nDenver dominated the first quarter, scoring two touchdowns while preventing the Jaguars from gaining a single first down. At the end of the Broncos' first drive, Tom Rouen's 35-yard punt pinned the Jags back on their own 10-yard line. Three plays later, Rod Smith returned Bryan Barker's 41-yard punt 6 yards to midfield. On Denver's second drive, a 47-yard run by Terrell Davis gave them a first down on the Jacksonville 2-yard line. The Jaguars kept Denver out of the end zone for the next three plays, but Vaughn Hebron scored a 1-yard touchdown run on fourth down, giving Denver a 6–0 lead after defensive end Clyde Simmons blocked the extra point. Then after the Broncos' defense forced a punt, Elway completed 4/4 passes for 57 yards on a 64-yard drive that ended on his 18-yard scoring connection to tight end Shannon Sharpe. But Elway's 2-point conversion pass to Sharpe was incomplete, keeping the score at 12–0.\nIn the second quarter, Jacksonville stormed back. First an 18-yard run by Natrone Means set up a 46-yard field goal by Mike Hollis. The next time the Jags got the ball, they cut their deficit to 12–10 with an 11-play, 80-yard scoring drive. After a controversial pass interference penalty wiped out a Tory James interception for Denver, Means gained 29 yards on a reception at the Broncos' 42, and later took the ball across the goal line on an 8-yard run. Following a Denver punt, Jacksonville got the ball back with 57 seconds left. Mark Brunell then completed a 43-yard pass to receiver Jimmy Smith to set up Hollis's 42-yard field goal, giving the team a 13–12 halftime lead.\nIn the third quarter, Denver was limited to 14 plays for 37 yards. Meanwhile, Brunell connected on a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell. Hollis later kicked a 22-yard field goal at the end of an 88-yard, 12-play drive that included James Stewart's 25-yard reception and a 12-men on the field penalty against the Broncos that gave Jacksonville a first down as they were getting ready to punt. This score, the fifth consecutive scoring possession against the fourth-ranked defense in the NFL, gave the Jags a 23–12 lead with less than 11 minutes left in the game. On Denver's next series, Hebron's 38-yard kickoff return fired up a 57-yard drive that ended on Davis's 2-yard touchdown run, and then his successful two-point conversion run shrunk the lead to 23–20. But Jacksonville responded with another touchdown drive, featuring a 29-yard run by Brunell to the Denver 21-yard line in which he covered both sidelines, broke one tackle and eluded three other defenders. Shortly later, he finished the drive with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Smith with 3:39 remaining, making the score 30–20. The Broncos then drove 80 yards in six plays and scored on Elway's 15-yard touchdown to wide receiver Ed McCaffrey with 1:50 left, but they had no timeouts left and Jason Elam's onside kick attempt was recovered by the Jaguars to secure the win.\nBrunell had the best postseason performance of his career, throwing for 245 yards and two touchdowns without an interception, and also rushing for 44 yards. Means rushed for 140 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 46 yards. Davis rushed for 91 yards and a touchdown, while also catching seven passes for 24 yards. It was the only playoff game of his career in which he didn't rush for 100 yards.\n\"What Brunell did at the end of the game was incredible,\" Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said. \"Our football team just hung in it, and that touchdown to Jimmy Smith in that situation was huge. I told the players at the beginning of the week I believed we could win. I didn't know how it would come down. I didn't give them that script.\"\n\"I'm just going to go home, sit on my couch and probably cry,\" said Sharpe after the game.\nRed Cashion, the game's referee retired after this game, capping off a 25-year career in the NFL that saw him referee two Super Bowls, XX and XXX.\nThe game was featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as Ambush at Mile High. This game was also the original \"Mile High Miracle\", which is now more commonly used to describe the between the Denver Broncos (the #1 seed at 13–3) and the Baltimore Ravens (the #4 seed at 10–6).\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Broncos and Jaguars, and the last time the Broncos ever wore their \"Orange Crush\" uniforms, they would bring them back just one more time as alternate uniforms in 2001.\nSunday, January 5, 1997.\nAFC: New England Patriots 28, Pittsburgh Steelers 3.\nIn their first home playoff game in 18 years, the Patriots blew out the Steelers 28–3 with 346 yards of total offense, while limiting the Steelers to 213.\nOn the first play from scrimmage, the Steelers got a taste of what lay in store as Pats quarterback Drew Bledsoe completed a 53-yard pass to Terry Glenn that set up Curtis Martin's 2-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh was quickly forced to punt, and New England took just four plays to score again, the last a 34-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Bledsoe to fullback Keith Byars, giving the team a 14–0 lead just over seven minutes into the first quarter. Then on the first play of the second quarter, Martin burst through a hole in the right line, dodged a tackle attempt by Carnell Lake, and raced 78 yards for a touchdown. This would end up not only being the longest run of his Hall of Fame career, but this was the second longest scoring run in NFL postseason history. Near the end of the half, Steelers cornerback Willie Williams intercepted a pass from Bledsoe to give his team a chance to get back in the game. But Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs on the Pats' 24-yard line and the score remained 21–0 going into halftime.\nThe Steelers lone score of the game occurred with 3:50 left in the third quarter, when linebacker Chad Brown's interception of a Bledsoe pass led to a 29-yard field goal by Norm Johnson. Pittsburgh then got the ball back on their own 36 following a Patriots punt, but any hope of a comeback was dashed when safety Lawyer Milloy intercepted a pass from Mike Tomczak on the New England 39-yard line. Six plays later, Martin's 23-yard touchdown run increased New England's lead to 28–3. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers managed a drive to the Patriots 15, only to lose the ball again on an interception by linebacker Willie Clay.\nMartin finished the day with 166 rushing yards and three touchdowns, while running back Dave Meggett returned seven punts for 72 yards and rushed for 18. Tomczak was held to 110 passing yards and intercepted twice in the final postseason game of his career. He was periodically replaced by versatile quarterback Kordell Stewart, but he fared no better, finishing the game 0/10 on pass attempts. Steelers running back Jerome Bettis, who rushed for 1,431 yards during the season and 102 yards in the previous playoff game, was held to just 43 yards on the ground and was limited by groin and ankle injuries. This was New England's first playoff win since their 1985 Super Bowl season.\n\"That might be my longest run ever\", Martin (a Pittsburgh native) said after the game about his 78-yard score. \"College, Pop Warner, everything. To me, the Steelers are my second-favorite team. I kind of worry about when I go home, how infamous I'll be.\"\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Steelers and Patriots.\nNFC: Carolina Panthers 26, Dallas Cowboys 17.\nThe second-year Panthers held Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman to 165 passing yards and forced three interceptions en route to their first playoff win in team history. On offense, running back Anthony Johnson was their top performer with 104 rushing yards and a 9-yard reception.\nDallas scored first when an interception by safety Darren Woodson on his own 47 and a 22-yard catch by Michael Irvin sparking a drive to the Panthers' 1-yard line. However, Irvin suffered a separated shoulder on his reception and had to miss the rest of the game. Meanwhile, Dallas could not get into the end zone despite two chances from the 1. Aikman threw an incomplete pass on second down, and on third down, Emmitt Smith was dropped for a three-yard loss, forcing the team to settle for Chris Boniol's 22-yard field goal. On the Panthers' ensuing drive, Dallas cornerback Kevin Smith kept it going with a pass interference penalty on third down, enabling Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins to complete the 68-yard possession with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Wesley Walls. On their next series, Winslow Oliver's 15-yard punt return set up a 42-yard drive that ended with Collins's 10-yard touchdown throw to Willie Green, giving the team a 14–3 lead in the second quarter.\nThe Cowboys countered with a 73-yard drive to score on Aikman's 2-yard touchdown pass to fullback Daryl Johnston, but they failed on the two-point conversion attempt and the Panthers lead was only cut to 14–9. They later got to 14–11 when a bad snap on a Carolina punt attempt went out of the end zone to give the Cowboys a safety. But then Panthers safety Chad Cota intercepted a pass from Aikman and returned it 49 yards to set up kicker John Kasay's 24-yard field goal with three seconds in the half, giving Carolina a 17–11 halftime lead.\nEarly in the second half, Oliver fumbled a punt return that Johnston recovered to set up a Boniol field goal, cutting the deficit to 17–14. But this was as close as the Cowboys would get, as the Panthers kicked three more field goals over the Cowboys' one. On the ensuing drive, Johnson rushed six times for 44 yards to set up Kasay's 40-yard field goal. Then after a punt, he carried the ball six times for 22 yards to set up another score on Kasay's 40-yard kick a few plays into the fourth quarter.\nDallas responded with a 78-yard drive, including a 25-yard run by Smith and a 16-yard run by Deion Sanders, to score on Boniol's 21-yard field goal, cutting the Cowboys' deficit to 23–17. Then the Cowboys forced a punt, getting the ball back with over 11 minutes still remaining on the clock, but Rohn Stark's kick was downed by Johnson on the Dallas 2-yard line. Then upon reaching their 37, Aikman threw a pass that was intercepted by Pat Terrell and returned 49 yards to the Cowboys' 19-yard line, setting up Kasay's fourth field goal to make the score 26–17. The next time Dallas got the ball, Aikman was intercepted again, this time by Sam Mills, enabling Carolina to run out the clock and win the game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Panthers and Cowboys.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 12, 1997.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 30, Carolina Panthers 13.\nThe Packers recorded 201 rushing yards and 476 total yards of offense. Green Bay running back Dorsey Levens recorded 117 yards receiving and 88 yards rushing, including a 29-yard touchdown catch. Quarterback Brett Favre managed to overcome two early turnovers that set up 10 Carolina points, completing 19 out of 29 passes for 292 yards and two touchdowns. Packers running back Edgar Bennett, who recorded 99 rushing yards, scored a touchdown from four yards out, and kicker Chris Jacke added three field goals. Carolina was held to just 251 total yards and had only one drive longer than 42 yards.\nEarly in the first quarter, Panthers linebacker Sam Mills intercepted a pass from Favre and returned it 10 yards to the Packers' 3-yard line, setting up Kerry Collins's 3-yard touchdown pass to fullback Howard Griffith. Green Bay struck back with a 35-yard run by Levens before Favre found him in the end zone for a 29-yard touchdown catch. But after the Packers forced a punt, Favre inexplicably dropped the ball while scrambling around in the backfield. Carolina defensive end Lamar Lathon recovered the fumble on the Packers' 45-yard line. A few plays later, John Kasay's 22-yard field goal put the Panthers back in the lead, 10–7.\nBut after that the Packers dominated the rest of the game. Favre responded by leading Green Bay 71 yards in 15 plays and scoring with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman. Then on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Tyrone Williams intercepted a pass from Collins on the Packers' 38-yard line. Favre's completions to Andre Rison and Freeman for gains of 23 and 25 yards moved the ball into field-goal range, and Jacke's 31-yard field goal finished the drive, giving Green Bay a 17–10 halftime lead.\nOn the first drive of the second half, Green Bay moved the ball 73 yards in 11 plays and scored with another Jacke field goal. The Panthers managed to respond with an 11-play, 73-yard drive of their own and score with Kasay's second field goal, which cut their deficit to seven points. But Green Bay stormed right back with a 74-yard touchdown drive, featuring a 66-yard reception by Levens. On the next play, Bennett's 4-yard touchdown run gave the Packers a 27–13 lead with two minutes left in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Packers defensive tackle Gilbert Brown slapped the ball out of the hands of running back Anthony Johnson and safety LeRoy Butler recovered the fumble, leading to Jacke's third field goal that made the score 30–13 with 10:02 left in the game.\nThis NFC Championship Game was the first one since 1991 that did not feature either the Dallas Cowboys or San Francisco 49ers. It was the first one ever to not feature either the Cowboys, Redskins, 49ers, or Rams.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Panthers and Packers.\nAFC: New England Patriots 20, Jacksonville Jaguars 6.\nAlthough New England gained just 234 yards compared to the Jags' 289, they made up the difference by forcing four turnovers, including three consecutive takeaways on the last three Jacksonville possessions of the game.\nThe Jaguars were forced to punt on their first possession, but a high snap enabled cornerback Larry Whigham to tackle punter Bryan Barker at the Jacksonville 4-yard line. Moments later, New England running back Curtis Martin scored a touchdown on a 1-yard run. After a few punts, New England managed a drive into Jaguars' territory, but cornerback Aaron Beasley intercepted Drew Bledsoe's pass at the 8-yard line to keep the score 7–0 at the end of the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter, Jaguars kicker Mike Hollis made a 32-yard field goal at the end of a 13-play, 62-yard drive. Their defense then forced the Patriots to punt, but returner Chris Hudson lost the ball from a hit by Marty Moore and Mike Bartrum recovered for New England on the Jags' 19-yard line. Adam Vinatieri kicked a 29-yard field goal as a result of the turnover, making the score 10–3. Later on, with 1:29 left in the half, Bledsoe led the Patriots down the field on a 68-yard drive, completing a 19-yard pass to Shawn Jefferson, a 5-yard toss to tight end Ben Coates on fourth and 5, and another completion to Jefferson that moved the ball 38 yards to the Jacksonville 3-yard line. New England could go no further, however, so Vinatieri kicked his second field goal of the day to increase their lead to 13–3 going into halftime.\nJacksonville took the second-half kickoff and drove to the New England 31-yard line, only to lose the ball when quarterback Mark Brunell was stuffed for no gain on fourth and 1. Three plays later, Bledsoe lost a fumble while being tackled by Kevin Hardy, which linebacker Eddie Robinson recovered for Jacksonville on the Pats' 37 to set up a 28-yard Hollis field goal that cut the score to 13–6.\nMidway through the fourth quarter, the Patriots drove to the Jacksonville 23-yard line. They were in prime position to build a big lead, but Bledsoe was sacked for a 6-yard loss on third down and Vinatieri drilled his 46-yard field goal attempt wide left. Jacksonville took the ball back and drove to the New England 5-yard line, but with just under four minutes left in the game, Patriots safety Willie Clay intercepted a Brunell pass in the end zone. Following a punt, Jacksonville got another chance to drive for the tying touchdown with 2:36 left. However, this time they lost the ball on their first play with a fumble by James Stewart. New England cornerback Otis Smith recovered the ball and returned it 47 yards for the game-clinching touchdown, giving his team a 20–6 lead. Jacksonville would get one more possession, which ended with an interception by middle linebacker Tedy Bruschi.\nThe game was also notable for a power outage (due to the power use at and around the stadium due to very cold temperatures) just minutes before halftime, which knocked out much of the lighting of the stadium, as well as most of the power in the surrounding community. (The television broadcast, however, was not affected, and stayed on throughout the outage by using generators.)\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Patriots and Jaguars.\nSuper Bowl XXXI: Green Bay Packers 35, New England Patriots 21.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Patriots and Packers."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1995 season began on December 30, 1995. The postseason tournament concluded with the Dallas Cowboys defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX, 27–17, on January 28, 1996, at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, ABC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games. Fox then televised the rest of the NFC games. NBC broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games and Super Bowl XXX.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 30, 1995.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 37, Miami Dolphins 22.\nAlthough Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino completed 33 out of 64 passes for 422 yards, the Bills jumped to a 27–0 lead going into the fourth quarter, forced four turnovers, and rushed 341 yards, the second highest amount in NFL postseason history and the most since Chicago gained 382 rushing yards in the 1940 NFL championship game.\nBuffalo started the scoring with a 58-yard drive, 45 yards which came from 3 receptions by Steve Tasker (who normally only played on special teams). Thurman Thomas finished off the possession with a 1-yard touchdown run to give the Bills a 7–0 early lead. Miami had to punt on their next drive, and John Kidd's kick went just 29 to the Bills 44-yard line. Three carries by Thomas for 26 yards on the following drive set up Steve Christie's 48-yard field goal. At the end of Miami's next possession, Kidd's 48-yard punt pinned Buffalo back at their own 1-yard line. Buffalo then drove 98 yards, with receiver Bill Brooks picking up 21 yards on an end-around run and Kelly completing a 26-yard pass to Tasker. Darick Holmes' 34-yard run then moved the ball to the Dolphins 1, but that was as far as the drive would go, as Gene Atkins intercepted Kelly's pass in the end zone on the first play of the second quarter.\nStill, Miami was unable to build any momentum. They managed to drive into Buffalo territory, only to turn the ball over on downs at the Bills 32. Then Thomas went back to work, breaking off a 13-yard run on the next play, and later taking off for a 32-yard gain to the Dolphins 21-yard line. On the next play, Buffalo scored on Holmes' 21-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 17–0. Then on the Dolphins' next drive, Dan Marino threw a pass that was deflected by Phil Hansen and picked off by linebacker Marlo Perry, giving Buffalo the ball on their 38-yard line. Following an 18-yard run and 7-yard reception by Thomas, Kelly capitalized on the turnover with a 37-yard touchdown throw to Tasker, increasing the Bills lead to 24–0. The next three drives would end poorly for both teams. First Miami turned the ball over on downs again when linebacker Cornelius Bennett tackled Terry Kirby one yard short of a first down on 4th and 10 from the Bills 40-yard line. Then Buffalo gave the ball right back when Kelly threw a pass that was intercepted by Troy Vincent. Miami went on to drive 61 yards, including Marino's 31-yard completion to wide receiver Gary Clark, to the Bills 35-yard line, but their drive ended there and Pete Stoyanovich missed a 53-yard field goal attempt on the last play of the half.\nThe situation didn't get better for Miami in the third quarter. On their first drive Marino was intercepted by defensive back Fimel Johnson. Then on their next possession, Marino fumbled a snap out of shotgun formation, and Bills defensive end Bryce Paup recovered it, resulting in Christie's second field goal that gave the Bills a 27–0 lead. The Dolphins responded by driving 67 yards, including Marino's 31-yard completion to O. J. McDuffie, to cut the score to 27–7 with McDuffie's 5-yard touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter. But after a Bills punt, the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs at the Bills 39. Following two carries by Thomas for 17 yards, fullback Tim Tindale, a rookie from Canada's Western Ontario University who had never gained more than 6 yards in a single carry before this game, took off for a 44-yard touchdown run, giving the Bills a 34–7 lead.\nThe game was essentially over by now, but there was plenty more scoring. Miami stormed back, driving 68 yards in 7 plays to score on Marino's 45-yard bomb to Randal Hill. Buffalo responded with 3 carries by Tindale for 23 yards to set up Christie's 42-yard field goal. Miami then moved the ball 73 yards in 9 plays. The key player on the drive was running back Terry Kirby, who caught 3 passes for 46 yards and finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run, making the final score of the game 37–22. The Dolphins managed to recover an onside kick, but lost the ball when Marino was intercepted by rookie Ken Irvin.\nBoth teams combined for a playoff record 1,038 total yards (502 for Miami, 536 for Buffalo). Thomas rushed for 158 yards, caught 3 passes for 48 yards, and scored a touchdown. Tasker rushed for 7 yards, while also catching 5 passes for 108 yards and a score, giving him his first career 100-yard receiving game (he would only have one more before his retirement after the 1997 season). Holmes rushed for 87 yards and a touchdown, while Tindale compiled 68 yards (more than his entire career regular season total) and a score of his own. McDuffie was the Dolphins top offensive performer with 11 receptions for 154 yards and a touchdown. This was the final game in the career of Dolphins head coach Don Shula, who retired as the NFL's all-time leader in coaching wins. It also marked a continuation of dominance against Miami by Bills coach Marv Levy. Since taking over as Buffalo's coach in 1986, Levy recorded a 17–5 record against the Dolphins, including 3–0 in the playoffs. This was the Bills' last playoff victory until 2020.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Dolphins and Bills. Buffalo won both prior meetings.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 58, Detroit Lions 37.\nPrior to this game, Detroit tackle Lomas Brown famously guaranteed on television that the Lions would win. The Eagles responded by opening up with a 51–7 lead over the Lions. The Eagles scored 31 points in the second quarter, recorded 6 interceptions, and held running back Barry Sanders to 40 rushing yards en route to a 58–37 victory in the second highest scoring game in NFL postseason history. The Eagles' 58 points were the third highest total in NFL postseason history, behind the Lions' 59 points in 1957 and the Bears' 73 points in the 1940 NFL championship game. Their 31-second quarter points was the second highest single quarter total in a postseason game, behind the Redskins' 35 second quarter points in Super Bowl XXII. Two Redskins players from that game, Barry Wilburn and linebacker Kurt Gouveia were playing on Philadelphia's defense in this one, and both would record an interception in this game.\nPhiladelphia scored first after Mark McMillian intercepted a pass from Detroit QB Scott Mitchell and returned it 16 yards to the Lions 15-yard line, setting up Charlie Garner's 15-yard touchdown run. Detroit responded with Mitchell's 32-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Sloan. Then Philadelphia exploded in the second quarter, starting with a 30-yard Garner run to set up Gary Anderson's 21-yard field goal. After a punt, the Eagles increased their lead to 17–7 with Rodney Peete's 22-yard touchdown to wide receiver Fred Barnett. Wilburn returned an interception 24 yards for a score less than a minute later, and then Gouveia picked off a pass from Mitchell to give his team a first down at the Lions 34. Following two 13-yard catches by Barnett, Ricky Watters' 1-yard touchdown run made the score 31–7. Later on with just five second left in the half, Eagles receiver Rob Carpenter caught a 43-yard touchdown reception on a Hail Mary pass on 3rd and 25, making the score 38–7 going into halftime.\nIn the second half, a 45-yard touchdown reception by Watters and two more field goals by Anderson increased the Eagles' lead, 51–7, still with slightly more than nine minutes remaining in the third quarter. From there, backup quarterback Don Majkowski replaced Mitchell and threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Herman Moore. Then Lions' linebacker Chris Spielman recovered an Eagles' fumble and Majkowski converted it into another touchdown, a 7-yard toss to receiver Johnnie Morton, cutting the score to 51–21. But Philadelphia linebacker William Thomas quickly put any thoughts of a Lions' comeback to rest by returning an interception 30 yards for a touchdown 23 seconds into the fourth quarter. All that lay ahead for the Lions were a pair of meaningless touchdowns, a 2-yard catch by Sloan and a 1-yard run by Ron Rivers to make the final score 58–37.\nPeete completed 17 of 25 passes for 270 yards and 3 touchdowns, while also rushing for 17 yards. Barnett caught 8 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown. Watters rushed for 49 yards, caught 3 passes for 64 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns. Lions receiver Herman Moore caught 7 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Lions and Eagles.\nSunday, December 31, 1995.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 37, Atlanta Falcons 20.\nThe Packers scored 13 unanswered points in the second quarter en route to a 37–20 victory over the Falcons.\nGreen Bay got an early scoring opportunity when George Teague intercepted a pass from Falcons quarterback Jeff George and returned it 30 yards to the Atlanta 22-yard line on the second play of the game. However, a 3rd down sack by Chris Doleman pushed the Packers back to the 28 and Chris Jacke missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. Atlanta scored first on quarterback Jeff George's 65-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Metcalf. But Green Bay countered, starting with Antonio Freeman's 42-yard kickoff return to the Packers 48-yard line. 52 yards and 8 plays later, the Packers scored on Edgar Bennett's 8-yard touchdown run. On Green Bay's next drive, they took advantage of a 35-yard pass interference penalty against Ron Davis, driving 78 yards to score on Brett Favre's 14-yard touchdown pass to Robert Brooks.\nOn the second play of the second quarter, Morten Andersen's 31-yard field goal made the score 14–10 at the end of a drive that featured a 55-yard completion from George to receiver Terance Mathis. However, Packers wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned a punt 76 yards for a touchdown, and Green Bay extended their lead to 20–10 (after the two-point conversion attempt failed). In the closing minutes of the first half, the Packers marched 85-yards in 14 plays to score on Favre's 2-yard touchdown to tight end Mark Chmura to reach a 27–10 halftime lead.\nAfter the first five drives of the third quarter ended in punts, Atlanta started an 80-yard drive that ended on George's 27-yard touchdown pass to J. J. Birden, making the score 27–17 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter. However, Atlanta's comeback hopes were soon dashed as Green Bay went on to drive 70 yards to score on Favre's 18-yard touchdown pass to running back Dorsey Levens. The key play of the drive was Favre's 20-yard completion to Brooks on 3rd and 8 from the Falcons 45-yard line, Favre's longest completion of the game. All that remained from this point would be a field goal from each team over the next two possessions.\nBennett turned in the best postseason performance of his career, finishing the game with 108 rushing yards, 3 receptions for 11 yards, and a touchdown. Favre threw for 199 yards and 3 touchdowns. Freeman had 72 punt return yards, 54 kickoff return yards, and 14 receiving yards. Metcalf had 227 all-purpose yards (8 receptions for 114 yards, 6 kickoff returns for 107 yards 2 punt returns for 6 yards) and a touchdown.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Falcons and Packers.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 35, San Diego Chargers 20.\nRookie fullback Zack Crockett, who had only one rushing attempt during the regular season, found himself thrust into the starting lineup to replace injured starter Marshall Faulk on the first play of the game. He proved up to the task, rushing for a franchise playoff record 147 yards and scoring two touchdowns to help the Colts win their first playoff game in 24 years. San Diego gained 429 yards of total offense, but quarterback Stan Humphries threw four interceptions, two to safety Jason Belser. Chargers running back Ronnie Harmon caught 10 passes for 133 yards, while Andre Coleman added six kickoff returns for 122.\nThe Chargers jumped to a 3–0 lead on their first drive by moving 30 yards and scoring with John Carney's 54-yard field goal. Later in the period, Colts linebacker Steve Grant intercepted a pass from Humphries and returned it 13 yards to the Chargers 33-yard line. But his team was unable to capitalize on the turnover. Five plays later, San Diego linebacker Junior Seau picked off a pass from Jim Harbaugh at the San Diego 1-yard line.\nA 46-yard punt return by Colts cornerback Ray Buchanan to the Chargers 27 set up Harbaugh's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ken Dilger a minute into the second quarter. But San Diego recaptured the lead on their ensuing possession by moving the ball 68 yards in 18 plays, converting five third downs on a drive in which no play gained more than 10 yards. Humphries's 6-yard scoring pass to tight end Alfred Pupunu at the end of it made the score 10–7. However, the Colts came right back with an 80-yard drive in which Harbaugh completed 4 of 5 passes for 43 yards and rushed for 2 before Crockett scored on 33-yard touchdown run to give the Colts a 14–10 lead. The Chargers countered with a drive to Indianapolis's 17-yard line. But with 17 seconds left in the first half, Humphries' pass was intercepted in the end zone by Ray McElroy.\n4 minutes into the third quarter, San Diego put together another long scoring drive, this one covering 90 yards in 12 plays, the longest a 24-yard reception by Harmon. Humphries finished it off with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Shawn Jefferson, giving the Chargers a 17–14 lead. Indianapolis quickly struck back with a 7-play, 81-yard drive in which Harbaugh completed 4/5 passes for 67 yards, the last a 42-yarder to wide receiver Sean Dawkins.\nIn the fourth quarter, runs by Terrell Fletcher and Aaron Hayden for respective gains of 20 and 15 yards set up Carney's 30-yard field goal to cut Indianapolis' lead to 21–20. But on the Colts' next drive, Crockett ran for a 66-yard touchdown and the Colts never looked back. On the Chargers' next possession, Belser intercepted a pass from Humphries and returned it 32 yards to the San Diego 23-yard line. Harbaugh then completed a 21-yard pass to Floyd Turner before taking the ball into the end zone himself on a 3-yard run. The Chargers had three more drives, but they would only result in another Belser interception, a turnover on downs, and time expiring in the game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Colts and Chargers.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 6, 1996.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 40, Buffalo Bills 21.\nRunning back Bam Morris scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter as the Steelers stopped the Bills, minus Hall of Fame defensive end Bruce Smith who fell ill the day before the game, from coming back from a 20–0 deficit. By the end of the game, the Steelers outgained them in total yards 409–250 and forced four turnovers.\nPittsburgh started off the scoring with a 76-yard drive in which receiver Yancy Thigpen caught a 43-yard pass and fullback John L. Williams finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Bills responded with a drive to the Steelers 21-yard line, but then Darick Holmes was tackled for a 13-yard loss by safety Carnell Lake and Steve Christie missed a 52-yard field goal attempt. Morris then rushed for 44 yards on a 58-yard possession that ended on Neil O'Donnell's 13-yard touchdown completion to Ernie Mills.\nEarly in the second quarter, Steelers receiver Andre Hastings returned a punt 12 yards to the Bills 43-yard line, setting up Norm Johnson's 45-yard field goal. Now facing a 17–0 deficit, the Bills offense self-destructed on their next drive. Facing 3rd and 8, Jim Kelly was sacked by linebacker Kevin Greene and fumbled the ball. Center Kent Hull recovered the fumble for Buffalo, but it didn't help much. On the next play, Lee Flowers stormed into the backfield and tackled punter Chris Mohr on the Bills 12-yard line, leading to another Johnson field goal that gave Pittsburgh a 20–0 lead. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Steelers 30-yard line, only to lose the ball when Lake forced a fumble from Thurman Thomas that was recovered by Chris Oldham. However, the Bills soon got the ball back with excellent field position after Rohn Stark punted the ball 33 yards to the Steelers 49. Kelly then got the team to the 1-yard line with three completions, hitting Tony Cline for 17 yards, Andre Reed for 5, and Steve Tasker for 26. Thomas then ran the ball into the end zone, cutting the score to 20–7. Only 45 seconds remained in the half, but O'Donnell proved up to the challenge of earning his team some more points, completing 4 consecutive passes for 53 yards to get the team to the Bills 16-yard line. Johnson finished the drive with his third field goal, giving the Steelers a 23–7 halftime lead.\nIn the third quarter, Lake intercepted a pass from Kelly and returned it 3 yards to the Buffalo 25-yard line, leading to Johnson's fourth field goal that put the team up 26–7. Both teams had to punt on their following drives, and Tasker returned Stark's 30-yard punt 4 yards to the Steelers 42-yard line. A few plays later, he took a handoff on a reverse and ran 40 yards to the 3. Alex Van Pelt (who replaced an injured Jim Kelly) finished the drive with 2-yard touchdown pass to Cline, making the score 26–14.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Buffalo took advantage of yet another poor punt from Stark, this one a 31-yard kick that gave them the ball on the Pittsburgh 36. Van Pelt then guided the team to the 11-yard line, where Kelly returned to the field and eventually hit Thomas for a 9-yard scoring completion, cutting the score to 26–21 with 11:23 left in the game. But Pittsburgh then marched 76 yards, including O'Donnell's 3rd down conversion passes to Thigpen and Andre Hastings for gains of 21 and 17 yards, to score on Morris' 13-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 33–21. The following three drives would result in interceptions, with Kelly throwing a pick to Jerry Olsavsky and Matt Darby nabbing a pass from O'Donnell. On the next play, Linebacker Levon Kirkland intercepted a pass from Kelly and returned it 4 yards to the Bills 23-yard line to set up Morris' 2-yard score with 1:58 remaining to clinch the victory.\nWith the Steelers win, they snapped the Bills' 10 game postseason winning streak against the AFC dating back to 1990. Morris rushed for 106 yards and caught 2 passes for 7. Lake had an interception and a fumble recovery.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Bills and Steelers. Both teams split the first two meetings.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 27, San Francisco 49ers 17.\nFor the first time ever since becoming the head coach of the Packers, Mike Holmgren was coaching against his former team where he was the Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks coach for six seasons.\nThe Packers jumped to a 21–0 lead en route to a 27–17 victory. Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre threw for 222 yards in the first half, and ended up with completing 21 out of 28 passes for 299 yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Robert Brooks caught four passes for 103 yards. Meanwhile, their defense sacked 49ers quarterback Steve Young three times and intercepted him twice. Young ended up setting a playoff record with 65 pass attempts, but completed only 32 of them for 328 yards. He added 77 yards on the ground. For the second playoff game in a row, Green Bay did not lose any turnovers, while the 49ers turned the ball over 4 times.\nThe Packers took the opening kickoff and held onto the ball for 7:11 before kicker Chris Jacke's 44-yard field goal attempt was blocked by 49ers safety Tim McDonald. But on San Francisco's first play, running back Adam Walker fumbled after being hit by linebacker Wayne Simmons. Rookie cornerback Craig Newsome picked up the ball and returned it 31 yards for the touchdown. Then after forcing the 49ers to punt, the Packers advanced 62 yards, with Favre completing a 35-yard pass to tight end Keith Jackson and a 20-yarder to Brooks, to score on Favre's 3-yard touchdown to Jackson, who finished the day with four receptions for 101 yards.\nGreen Bay would later drive 72 yards in 7 plays to score on tight end Mark Chmura's 13-yard touchdown reception before Young's 32-yard completion to Jerry Rice set up Jeff Wilkins 21–3 field goal to cut the lead to 21–3 at the end of the half. In the second half, Jacke kicked two field goals while the 49ers could only manage two touchdowns: a 1-yard run by Young and a 2-yarder by running back Derek Loville.\nThis was the only time during the 1990s that an NFC team won a divisional playoff game on the road. Rice finished the game with 11 receptions for 117 yards, while 49ers tight end Brent Jones had 8 catches for 112.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Packers and 49ers.\nSunday, January 7, 1996.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 30, Philadelphia Eagles 11.\nWith Eagles starting quarterback Rodney Peete injured early on, the Cowboys held Philadelphia to only 227 yards and 11 points.\nThe Cowboys scored on their second drive of the game, moving the ball 37 yards to Chris Boniol's 24-yard field goal. Following an Eagles punt, Mark McMillian intercepted a pass from Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman and returned it 34 yards to the Cowboys 43, setting up Gary Anderson's 26-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. On Philadelphia's field goal drive, Peete suffered a concussion when he was tackled by Darren Woodson one yard short of a first down on the Dallas 9-yard line, knocking him out of the game and Randall Cunningham replaced him.\nIn the second quarter, Dallas running back Emmitt Smith rushed four times for 25 yards and caught a 22-yard reception on a 70-yard drive that Deion Sanders finished with a 21-yard touchdown on an end-around run. The Eagles managed just one first down before punting. Cowboys then marched 79 yards, including a Troy Aikman's completions of 37 and 26 yards to receiver Kevin Williams and fullback Daryl Johnston. Johnston's catch gave the team a first down on the Eagles 1-yard line, and Smith ran the ball into the end zone on the next play, giving the team a 17–3 lead with 3:42 left in the half.\nWilliams returned the second half kickoff 24 yards, and then caught a 34-yard pass as his team drove 59 yards to score on Boniol's 18-yard field goal, making the score 20–3. On Dallas' next drive, they upped their lead to 23–3 with Boniol's franchise record 51-yard field goal.\nIn the fourth quarter, Sanders intercepted a pass from Cunningham and returned it 12 yards to the Eagles 21-yard line, leading to their final score on Aikman's 9-yard pass to Michael Irvin. The Eagles responded as Cunningham completed 4/5 passes for 63 yards before taking the ball into the end zone himself on a 4-yard run. He also completed a pass for a 2-point conversion, but by then only 2:36 remained in the game.\nAikman finished the game 17/24 for 253 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Irvin, who was double teamed most of the game, had only one reception, but Williams caught 6 passes for 124 yards and returned 2 kickoffs for 45. Smith rushed for 99 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 3 passes for 40. Eagles running back Ricky Watters, who rushed for 1,273 yards during the season, finished this game with just 39 yards on 13 attempts, though he also caught 4 passes for 45 yards. As of the end of the 2022 season, this is the most recent Divisional Playoff win for the Cowboys. They have lost seven of those games since (, , , , , and ).\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Eagles and Cowboys. Both teams split the first two meetings.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 10, Kansas City Chiefs 7.\nThe Chiefs, who held the league's best record during the regular season (13–3), were heavily favored to beat the 9–7 Colts, particularly since Indianapolis star running back Marshall Faulk was inactive due to injury, along with defensive tackle Tony Siragusa due to illness. But by the end of the game, Kansas City lost four turnovers and kicker Lin Elliott missed three field goals en route to a 10–7 Colts upset.\nAfter the first four possessions of the game resulted in punts, Kansas City scored on quarterback Steve Bono's 20-yard touchdown to wide receiver Lake Dawson with 29 seconds left in the first quarter on a drive that covered 62 yards in 5 plays. Indianapolis countered with a long methodical 18-play drive in which they converted five third downs and one fourth down on the way to Jim Harbaugh's 5-yard touchdown pass to receiver Floyd Turner to tie the game. Harbaugh had made several key plays on the drive, converting a 3rd and 11 with an 18-yard scramble and three plays later finding receiver Aaron Bailey for a 13-yard completion on 3rd and 10. Running back Lamont Warren also made a big play by converting a 4th and 1 situation with a 4-yard gain. Later on, Colts kicker Cary Blanchard missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 57 seconds left in the half. Kansas City then drove to the Colts 17-yard line, only to have Elliott hit the uprights from 35 yards out.\nIn the third period, Ashley Ambrose intercepted a pass from Bono at midfield, setting up Blanchard's 30-yard field goal to give his team the lead. Early in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs reached the Indianapolis 22-yard line, but all they got was another missed field goal, this one from 39 yards with 10:36 left to play. Indianapolis failed to gain a first down with their next two drives, while Bono threw consecutive interceptions, one to linebacker Quentin Coryatt and another to cornerback Eugene Daniel. After the Coryatt interception, the Colts had a chance to increase their lead, but Blanchard missed a field goal attempt from 49 yards out. With 4:12 left in the game, Rich Gannon replaced Bono and led the Chiefs from their own 18 to the Colts 25-yard line. But with 42 seconds left, Elliott missed his third field goal of the day, a 42-yard attempt, and Indianapolis escaped with a win.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Colts and Chiefs.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 14, 1996.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 20, Indianapolis Colts 16.\nOn the Steelers opening drive, Neil O'Donnell's first pass of the game was tipped by defensive tackle Tony Siragusa and intercepted by Jeff Herrod, who returned it to the Pittsburgh 24-yard line. But the Colts drive was halted when Ray Seals tackled running back Lamont Warren for a loss on third down and one. On the next play, Cary Blanchard hit the right upright on his 34-yard field goal, but it still bounced in and the Colts took a 3–0 lead. After each team punted, Pittsburgh's Norm Johnson kicked a field goal to even the game with under two minutes left in the first quarter. The field goal occurred after Kordell Stewart dropped a pass in the end zone. Replays showed Colts safety Jason Belser made contact with Stewart just before the ball arrived, but no penalty flag was thrown.\nIn the second quarter, a 30-yard reception by Colts receiver Sean Dawkins set up Blanchard's second field goal. But later on, Pittsburgh drove 80 yards in 17 plays, featuring three third down conversion runs by Kordell Stewart, and scored on O'Donnell's 5-yard third and goal touchdown pass to Stewart with 13 seconds left in the half to make it 10–6. Replays showed Stewart had put half a foot out of bounds before making the catch, which would have made him an ineligible receiver, but the penalty was not called.\nOn Indianapolis' first drive of the second half, they drove 61 yards in nine plays, featuring a 29-yard completion from Jim Harbaugh to tight end Ken Dilger. Blanchard finished the drive with his third field goal to cut their deficit to 10–9. Then after forcing a three and out, Indy drove 35 yards in nine plays to set up another field goal try, which would have put the Colts up 12–10. But this time Blanchard's 47-yard attempt sailed wide right. Taking over on their own 37, Pittsburgh mounted a drive in Colts territory where Johnson's 37-yard field goal put them back up by four points, at 13–9.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, a long punt return by Steelers receiver Andre Hastings gave them the ball at midfield. But all they got out of their great field position was a missed field goal. After that, Harbaugh threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Floyd Turner to take the lead, 16–13. After a Steelers punt, their defense got a big chance when Warren fumbled deep in Colts territory, but guard Joe Staysniak recovered the ball in mid-air to keep the drive going. Later on, cornerback Willie Williams tackled Warren behind the line on third down and one to force a punt, giving Pittsburgh the ball back with 3:03 left in the game.\nPittsburgh then marched 67 yards to score the winning touchdown. Running back Byron Bam Morris scored the game-winning 1-yard touchdown run with 1:34 remaining in the game to pull Pittsburgh ahead for good. The drive was aided by O'Donnell's 9-yard completion to Hastings on fourth down and 3 from the 47-yard line, as well as an earlier dropped potential interception that went in and out of the arms of linebacker Quentin Coryatt. On the next play after Hastings' fourth down conversion catch, O'Donnell completed a 37-yard pass to Ernie Mills on the Indianapolis 1-yard line, setting up Morris' 1-yard scoring run. The Colts got the ball back and advanced to the Steelers' 29 with 5 seconds left, narrowly avoiding a turnover when Chris Oldham dropped a wide open interception. On the game's final play, Harbaugh attempted a hail mary pass which he lofted high and came down into a crowd of players in the end zone; the ball momentarily was against the Colts' WR Aaron Bailey's chest but it hit the turf before he could haul it in.\nThe Colts were the first No. 5 seed to advance to a conference championship game since the 1990 playoff expansion. Harbaugh completed 21 of 33 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown.\nThe game was featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as 60 Minutes. It marked the end of a thrilling and hard-fought season for the Colts, in which 15 of their 19 games were decided by one score, including three that went into overtime.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Colts and Steelers. Pittsburgh won both previous meetings when the Colts were previously in Balitmore.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 38, Green Bay Packers 27.\nRunning back Emmitt Smith rushed for 150 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns, while also catching 2 passes for 17 yards as the Cowboys overcame a Packers 27–24 lead in the fourth quarter.\nGreen Bay got off to a slow start as quarterback Brett Favre threw incompletions on his first six pass attempts of the game and the team failed to gain any yards on their first 9 plays. However, Packers linebacker Bernardo Harris blocked a punt from John Jett on the game's opening drive that gave the team the ball at the Dallas 23 and enabled them to score first on Chris Jacke's 46-yard field goal. Dallas stormed right back with an 11-play, 80-yard drive, featuring a 35-yard reception by Deion Sanders. Troy Aikman finished the drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Michael Irvin. Then Dallas defensive tackle Leon Lett intercepted a screen pass from Favre on the Packers 13, and they scored another touchdown on Aikman's 4-yard throw to Irvin, giving the team a 14–3 lead. However, Favre's first completion of the day turned out to be a big one, a 73-yard touchdown bomb to Robert Brooks. Dallas was forced to punt on their next drive, and Antonio Freeman gave his team great field position with a 39-yard return, with an additional 15 yards coming from a facemask penalty on Jett. This gave the Packers the ball on the Dallas 35, and two plays into the second quarter, Favre threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Keith Jackson. So despite only holding the ball for 2:53 in the first quarter, Green Bay now had the lead at 17–14.\nThe Cowboys responded with two long drives for 10 points and a 24–17 halftime lead. Chris Boniol tied the game with his 29th consecutive field goal, putting it through the uprights from 34 yards to conclude a 60-yard drive. Packers punter Craig Hentrich subsequently pinned Dallas back at their own 1-yard line with a 57-yard kick, but Smith bailed his team out with a 25-yard run on the next play, starting off a playoff-record 99-yard drive. Irvin made two big receptions on it, converting the drive's only third down with a 10-yard catch and later hauling in a pass for a 28-yard gain on the Packers 16-yard line. With 24 seconds left in the half, Smith finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.\nPersonal fouls against Lett and Dixon Edwards helped start two Green Bay scoring drives in the third quarter. They opened the half with a 52-yard drive to score on Jacke's 37-yard field goal. The next time they got the ball, Favre's 54-yard completion to tight end Keith Jackson set up his 1-yard touchdown pass to Brooks that gave the Packers a 27–24 lead. But Dallas regained the lead a few plays into the fourth quarter after Smith's 5-yard touchdown run capped off a 90-yard possession. Green Bay responded with a drive past midfield, but Cowboys cornerback Larry Brown put an end to it by intercepting Favre's pass and returning it 28 yards to the Dallas 48. Irvin made a juggling reception near the sidelines for a 36-yard gain on the next play, and then Smith took the ball into the end zone with a 16-yard run to ice the game. Green Bay's final two possessions would each end with a turnover on downs.\nAikman completed 21 of 33 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns. Irvin caught 7 passes for 100 yards and 2 scores. Favre threw for 307 yards and 3 touchdowns, with 2 interceptions. Brooks finished the game with 6 receptions for 105 yards and 2 touchdowns. Freeman had 212 all-purpose yards (10 rec, 148 KR, 54 PR)\nAfter the contest, Reggie White was so visibly upset, he started shouting at television crews who were filming him on the sidelines. This was the third consecutive year that Dallas eliminated Green Bay from the playoffs (All three games were played in Dallas). \"We keep coming down here and getting lessons,” said Packers coach Mike Holmgren, whose team had lost six in a row in Dallas since October 1993. \"I'm tired of getting lessons.\"\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys were jubilant about making their third Super Bowl appearance in the last four seasons. \"We're going home\", Irvin said after the game. \"We let somebody else borrow our house last year, but we're going back where we belong. I'm going to check the lease, make sure they cleaned up after themselves.\"\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Packers and Cowboys. Dallas had won three of the prior five meetings.\nSuper Bowl XXX: Dallas Cowboys 27, Pittsburgh Steelers 17.\nThis was an NFL-leading third Super Bowl meeting between the Cowboys and Steelers. Pittsburgh won both previous meetings."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1993 season began on January 8, 1994. The postseason tournament concluded with the Dallas Cowboys defeating the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII, 30–13, on January 30, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.\nSince the 1993 regular season was conducted over 18 weeks (two byes per team), the traditional bye week between the conference championship games and Super Bowl was removed.\nSchedule.\nThese playoffs marked the final season that CBS was the NFC network. Fox would then take over the rights to the NFC before the start of the following season. ABC continued to broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games, and NBC televised the rest of the AFC games. CBS would not televise an NFL game again until 1998 when it replaced NBC as the AFC network.\nNBC was also the broadcaster of Super Bowl XXVIII.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 8, 1994.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 27, Pittsburgh Steelers 24 (OT).\nChiefs kicker Nick Lowery made the winning 32-yard field goal after 11:03 of overtime, to earn themselves a win over the Steelers in a game in which both teams combined for 770 yards, no fumbles lost, and no interceptions.\nThe Steelers scored first by driving 66 yards, featuring a 32-yard reception by running back Merril Hoge, and scoring on Neil O'Donnell's 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Adrian Cooper. Later in the first quarter, Kansas City drove 75 yards in seven plays and tied the game after backup quarterback Dave Krieg, who temporarily replaced injured starter Joe Montana, threw a 23-yard touchdown to wide receiver J. J. Birden.\nThe Steelers responded with a long 15-play drive to retake the lead on Gary Anderson's 30-yard field goal, making the score 10–7. After a punt, Pittsburgh drove back to the Chiefs 35-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs. Kansas City then took over and drove to the Steelers 42, but on fourth down and 1, defensive end Gerald Williams sacked Montana for a 7-yard loss, giving his team the ball on their own 49 with under a minute left. The Steelers made the most of their opportunity, scoring on O'Donnell's 26-yard touchdown completion to Ernie Mills that increased their lead to 17–7 at the end of the half.\nMost of the third quarter was a defensive struggle until the Chiefs put together a 49-yard drive to score on Lowery's 23-yard field goal. Then in the fourth quarter, Montana connected with Willie Davis for 22 yards and Birden for 19 on the way to Marcus Allen's 2-yard touchdown run that tied the game at 17. O'Donnell led the Steelers right back though, completing a 26-yard pass to Dwight Stone before hooking up with Eric Green for a 22-yard touchdown throw to retake the lead, 24–17.\nIn the final minutes of regulation, tight end Keith Cash blocked a Pittsburgh punt and Fred Jones returned it 31 yards to the Steelers 9-yard line. On fourth down, Montana threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tim Barnett, tying the game at 24 with 1:43 left in the game. Then after forcing Pittsburgh to punt, Kansas City drove 47 yards to set up Lowery's 43-yard field-goal attempt in the closing seconds, but the kick was wide right and thus the game went into overtime.\nKansas City won the coin toss to receive the overtime kickoff, but went three and out. Pittsburgh then drove to midfield before they also had to punt. At this point, Montana completed several passes, including an 18-yarder to Cash to move the Chiefs into position for Lowery's game winning score.\nMontana finished the game 23/42 for 276 passing yards and a touchdown, with no interceptions. O'Donnell completed 23/42 passes for 286 yards and three scores.\nThis was the Chiefs last playoff win at home until the 2018 season.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Steelers and Chiefs.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 28, Detroit Lions 24.\nIn week 17, the Lions defeated Green Bay 30–20, intercepting four passes from quarterback Brett Favre and winning despite playing without their best offensive star, running back Barry Sanders. The win gave them homefield advantage for this game. But even though Sanders recovered from his injury in time for the playoffs, this time the Packers won by overcoming a 17–7 third quarter deficit and pulling ahead on Favre's 40-yard game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe with 55 seconds left.\nDetroit held the ball for over 10 minutes in the first quarter, but could only score three points. Early in the game, a 25-yard run by Sanders with an additional 15 yards added on by a facemask penalty on LeRoy Butler sparked a drive deep into Green Bay territory, but it ended with no points when Terrell Buckley intercepted a pass from Erik Kramer in the end zone. After forcing a punt, the Lions drove 59 yards, mostly on receptions by Brett Perriman, and scored on Jason Hanson's 47-yard field goal on the last play of the first quarter.\nGreen Bay responded to the field goal by driving 80 yards and scoring on Favre's 12-yard touchdown pass to Sharpe. Then Green Bay caught a break when their kickoff hit the ground near the sideline, bounced into returner Mel Gray and then bounced out of bounds at the Lions 5-yard line. But it didn't stop Detroit as they still drove 95 yards, featuring a 44-yard run by Sanders and a 13-yard third down conversion reception by Perriman after the ball bounced off Sanders' hands, and scored on Perriman's one handed 1-yard touchdown reception to take a 10–7 lead at the end of the half.\nMidway through the third quarter, Jim Arnold's punt pinned Green Bay at their own 5-yard line. Two plays later, Melvin Jenkins intercepted a pass from Favre and returned it 15 yards for a touchdown to extend the Lions' lead, 17–7. But the Packers countered with a 72-yard drive to score on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Favre to Sharpe. Detroit responded by driving 74 yards, including a 31-yard catch by Perriman, to a 2nd and goal on the Green Bay 5-yard line. On the next play, Packers safety George Teague intercepted Kramer's pass in the end zone and returned it a playoff record 101 yards to give the Packers a 21–17 lead. But on their ensuing drive Lions would regain the lead by moving the ball 89 yards to score on running back Derrick Moore's 5-yard touchdown with 8:27 left in the fourth quarter.\nCorey Harris' 45-yard kickoff return gave the Packers good field position, but they were unable to take advantage and had to punt after demoralizing third down play in which Favre overthrew wide open receiver Mark Clayton near the end zone. After forcing a punt, Robert Brooks' 21-yard return gave Green Bay the ball on their own 29-yard line with 2:24 left in regulation. Favre started off the drive with an 11-yard completion to Edgar Bennett. His next pass to tight end Ed West moved the ball 9 yards to midfield. Following a 4-yard run by Bennett, Favre's 6-yard completion to Sharpe advanced the team to the Lions 40-yard line. On the next play, he took the snap and ran left. Kevin Scott, who was covering Sharpe one on one along the right sideline, slowed down a bit when he saw Favre running, just enough for Sharpe to pull ahead of him and Favre launched a 40-yard pass to Sharpe in the end zone for the game winning score. Gray was tackled by Green Bay's Marcus Wilson after returning the ensuing kickoff just 8 yards to the 19-yard line, leaving Detroit with 51 seconds and all three timeouts left to drive for the winning touchdown. Over the next four plays, Tony Bennett sacked Kramer for 2-yard loss, Sanders picked up 3 yards on a swing pass, and Kramer threw two incompletions.\nSanders had the best postseason performance of his career, finishing the game with 167 rushing yards. Kramer completed 22/31 passes for 248 yards and a touchdown, with two interception. Perriman caught 10 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. Favre completed 15/26 passes for 204 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception. Sharpe, who had not practiced in the last eight weeks due to turf toe (though he was still able to play in games) and had set the NFL single season record for receptions in their week 17 meeting against Detroit, caught five passes for 101 yards and tied a playoff record with three touchdowns. This was Scott's last game in the NFL.\nThe Lions lost despite significantly outgaining the Packers in total yards (410–293), first downs (25–16), and time of possession (35:34–24:26). \"It's just a shame,\" Lions coach Wayne Fontes said after the game. \"This team played an excellent football game today and lost. They couldn't slow us down.\"\nThis was the final playoff game at the Pontiac Silverdome. This was the last time the Lions hosted a playoff game until 2024. It was the franchise's first, and to date only home playoff loss.\nThis was featured on NFL's Greatest Games as Favre to Sharpe.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Packers and Lions.\nSunday, January 9, 1994.\nNFC: New York Giants 17, Minnesota Vikings 10.\nA howling, gusting wind dominated the game as both teams could only score a combined 27 points. However, the Giants managed to score two touchdowns, both by running back Rodney Hampton in the third quarter, to pull ahead for good.\nNew York had the wind at their back in the first quarter, but could only score on kicker David Treadwell's 26-yard field goal on their opening drive. In the second quarter, they had another chance to score, but receiver Mark Jackson dropped a pass on third and 7 from the Vikings 7 and then Treadwell drilled a 34-yard field goal attempt wide left. Meanwhile, the Vikings went up 7–3 on Jim McMahon's 40-yard pass to wide receiver Cris Carter. Near the end of the half, Giants quarterback Phil Simms threw a third down pass to Dave Meggett that lost nine yards, bringing up fourth and 19 from the New York 23. On the next play, punter Mike Horan shanked a kick that went right into the back of teammate Greg Jackson, a blocker in the backfield, enabling the Vikings to take over on the Giants 36 with 29 seconds left in the half and take a 10–3 halftime lead on Fuad Reveiz's franchise postseason record 52-yard field goal.\nThe Giants had the wind again in the third quarter, and on their first drive of the second half, Hampton scored on a 51-yard rushing touchdown, the longest run in Giants postseason history. Then Harry Newsome's punt went just 21 yards to the Minnesota 26-yard line. Hampton subsequently converted a fourth and 1 situation with a 2-yard run and rushed for five yards on third and 2 as the team drove to another touchdown on his 2-yard score. On the extra point attempt, the snap sailed right through Horan's hands and went right into the arms of Treadwell. However, Treadwell managed to run the ball into the end zone for a successful conversion, giving the team a 17–10 lead.\nAlthough the Vikings held the wind advantage again during the final quarter, the Giants defense managed to shut them down to preserve the victory. The Vikings had a great chance to tie the game when Carter caught a deep pass from backup quarterback Sean Salisbury and appeared to be on his way to a sure touchdown, but safety Myron Guyton caught up with him from behind and knocked the ball out of his hands. Jackson recovered it for the Giants on the Vikings 15-yard line to put the game away.\nHampton finished the game with 33 carries for 161 yards and two touchdowns, along with six receptions for 24 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Vikings and Giants. This was also the final game of Vikings running back Roger Craig's career.\nAFC: Los Angeles Raiders 42, Denver Broncos 24.\nAfter a 21–21 tie at halftime, Raiders running back Napoleon McCallum scored three rushing touchdowns in the second half to lead his team to the victory.\nLos Angeles opened up the scoring on their second drive, with Jeff Hostetler completing a 23-yard pass to Alexander Wright and a 45-yarder to James Jett before finishing the drive with a 9-yard touchdown toss to tight end Ethan Horton. Denver responded by driving 66 yards, including a 17-yard burst by Robert Delpino with a facemask penalty adding another 15, to score on John Elway's 23-yard touchdown pass to tight end Shannon Sharpe. But the tie only lasted a few minutes until Hostetler gave the Raiders a 14–7 lead with a 65-yard touchdown completion to Tim Brown on third and 12.\nIn the second quarter, Elway threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Reggie Johnson at the end of a 12-play drive that included his 25-yard completion to Derek Russell. But Hostetler promptly regained the lead for his team with a 54-yard touchdown bomb to Jett. Still Elway rallied Denver back, completing 8/10 passes for 66 yards on a 13-play, 77-yard drive, the last one a 6-yard score to Russell that tied the game with just 32 seconds left in the half. In the first half alone, Elway completed 18/25 passes for 199 yards, while Hostetler completed 6/9 passes for 202 yards and each had thrown three touchdowns.\nIn the second half, Los Angeles dominated the game. First, Tom Rouen's 30-yard punt enabled LA to take over the ball at the Denver 35-yard line, and to set up McCallum's 26-yard touchdown. Another short punt by the Broncos allowed the Raiders to take over at the Denver 48-yard line, and Hostetler's 33-yard pass to Horton enabled McCallum to rush for a 2-yard touchdown. After Broncos kicker Jason Elam made a 23-yard field goal to cut the lead, 35–24, the Raiders marched 76 yards in the fourth quarter to score on McCallum's 1-yard touchdown to clinch the victory.\nHostetler had one of the best performances of his career, completing 13 of 19 passes for 294 yards and three touchdowns. Elway completed 29 of 47 passes for 302 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 23 yards. Sharpe tied a playoff record with 13 receptions for 156 yards and a touchdown. Jett caught three passes for 111 yards and a score.\nLos Angeles committed 17 penalties, a playoff record. This was the most recent NFL playoff game played in the city of Los Angeles until 2017, and the last playoff game won by an LA-based team until 2018.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Broncos and Raiders. Denver won the only prior meeting.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 15, 1994.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 29, Los Angeles Raiders 23.\nIn one of the coldest games in NFL history, the Bills overcame a 17–13 Raiders lead by scoring three times in a span of 6:18 in the second half.\nThe Raiders got the first scoring opportunity of the game when quarterback Jeff Hostetler's first pass of the game was complete to Tyrone Montgomery for a 19-yard gain to the Bills 29-yard line. But a third down sack by Buffalo defensive end Bruce Smith halted the drive and Jeff Jaeger missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards. Buffalo then took over and drove to the Raiders 30-yard line, but also came up empty when Jim Kelly threw an incomplete pass on a fourth and 1 conversion attempt.\nAfter the turnover, Hostetler threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Ethan Horton and a 12-yard completion to Nick Bell on the way to a 30-yard field goal by Jaeger, giving Los Angeles a 3–0 lead early in the second quarter. But Buffalo quickly stormed back with a huge play from special teams expert Steve Tasker, who snagged Jaeger's short kickoff out of the air while on the run and raced 67 yards to the Raiders 1-yard line before being shoved out of bounds by Willie Gault. Following an offsides penalty against the Raiders, running back Kenneth Davis' took the ball across the goal line on the next play, giving the Bills a 6–3 lead after Steve Christie missed the extra point.\nRaiders receiver Raghib Ismail returned the ensuing kickoff 33 yards to his 43-yard line, sparking an 8-play, 57-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Napoleon McCallum. Then on the first play after the kickoff, safety Eddie Anderson forced a fumble from Pete Metzelaars, and cornerback Terry McDaniel recovered the ball on the Bills 40-yard line, setting up McCallum's second 1-yard touchdown run (this one on a fourth down) to increase their lead to 17–6. But Buffalo, who had gained just 44 total yards at this point, struck right back with a 4-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. After three consecutive Kelly completions, a 37-yard pass interference penalty on Torin Dorn moved the ball to the Raiders 8-yard line, and Thurman Thomas ran it into the end zone from there, cutting the score to 17–13 with 50 seconds left in the half.\nBuffalo started out the second half with a good drive into Raiders territory, but it ended with no points when Christie missed a 43-yard field goal try. Later on, the Bills scored three times in a span of 6:18 of the final two quarters to put the game away. Quarterback Jim Kelly first threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bill Brooks at the end of a 5-play, 60-yard drive, giving Buffalo a 19–17 lead after Christie missed the extra point. Then after Bills safety Henry Jones recovered a fumble by McCallum that was forced by Smith, Christie kicked a 29-yard field goal. On the Raiders' next possession, wide receiver Tim Brown scored on an 86-yard touchdown reception from Hostetler. Jaeger hit the uprights on the extra point attempt, but Los Angeles retook the lead at 23–22 with less than a minute left in the third quarter. However, Buffalo then drove 71 yards to score on Brooks' 22-yard touchdown reception from Kelly with 12:05 left in the game.\nBuffalo's defense kept Los Angeles pinned down for the remained of the quarter to clinch the victory, forcing punts on each of their next two drives. After the second punt, the Bills offense held onto the ball for the final six minutes of the game, featuring three first down runs by Davis, one of them a 17-yard gain.\nBrown had the best postseason performance of his career, catching five passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. Kelly completed 27 of 37 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns. Brooks caught six passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns. Smith had two sacks and a forced fumble. His two sacks gave his a career postseason total of 11, moving him past Richard Dent as the NFL's all-time leader in that category.\nThis was the final playoff game played by the Raiders as a Los Angeles-based team and their last as a franchise until 2000. This was the final playoff game played by a Los Angeles-based team until 2017.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Raiders and Bills. Buffalo won the only prior meeting.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 44, New York Giants 3.\n49ers running back Ricky Watters rushed for 118 yards, caught five passes for 46 yards, and scored an NFL playoff record five touchdowns as San Francisco crushed the Giants, 44–3. The 49ers racked up 413 yards of offense, with an average of 6.4 yards per play, while holding the Giants to just 194 yards, 4 sacks, and forcing three turnovers.\nSan Francisco started off the game with an 80-yard drive in which Steve Young completed his first four passes, including a 31-yard completion to John Taylor on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Watters. Kicker Mike Cofer missed the extra point, but little else would go wrong for San Francisco for the rest of the game. Following a Giants punt, San Francisco went up 9–0 on Cofer's 29-yard field goal. Then linebacker Bill Romanowski deflected a Simms pass into the arms of Tim McDonald, who returned the ball four yards to the Giants 41. Eight plays later, Watters scored another 1-yard touchdown run to give the 49ers a 16–0 lead. After another New York punt, San Francisco drove 92 yards, featuring a 43-yard reception by Taylor, to score on Watters' third touchdown of the day, this one from two yards out. New York eventually cut the score to 23–3 at halftime with a 25-yard field goal from kicker David Treadwell after they stopped the 49ers on fourth and 1 on their own 21-yard line, but this would be their only score.\nWatters added two more touchdowns in the second half. He actually had a chance to score a sixth touchdown, but he was taken out of the game early in the fourth quarter with the ball on the Giants 11-yard line. Instead, he got to sit on the bench as Marc Logan scored the 49ers final points on a 2-yard run.\n\"There was no question who was the best team out there today\", said Giants coach Dan Reeves. \"I'm disappointed that we came in and played this way. It hurts; it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The 49ers took us out of our element very quickly. They struck quickly and repeatedly, and took the running game away from us.\"\nAlthough he didn't throw any touchdown passes, Young was near-perfect in the game, completing 17 of 22 passes for 226 yards, and rushing for 17 yards on the ground.\nThis was also the final game for Giants legends Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms. The Giants would retire both of their numbers by 1995.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Giants and 49ers. New York won three of the previous five meetings.\nSunday, January 16, 1994.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 27, Green Bay Packers 17.\nThe Cowboys broke the game open by scoring 10 points in the final 23 seconds of the first half, and held on for the win by intercepting two passes in the fourth quarter.\nGreen Bay got an early chance to score when LeRoy Butler recovered a fumble from Dallas running back Emmitt Smith on the Cowboys 43-yard line. But on the next play, Packers quarterback Brett Favre lost a fumble while being sacked by Tony Tolbert that was recovered by Dallas defensive tackle Leon Lett. Later, the Packers got the ball on the Cowboys 28-yard line by stopping them on a fake punt attempt, leading to Chris Jacke's 30-yard field goal that gave them a 3–0 lead.\nIn the second quarter, Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman completed four consecutive passes on a 65-yard drive, the last a 25-yard touchdown to wide receiver Alvin Harper. Green Bay returner Corey Harris fumbled the ensuing kickoff out of bounds at his own 4-yard line. Green Bay still managed to drive to the Cowboys 31-yard line, with Favre completing a 48-yard pass to Sterling Sharpe on the way, but the drive ended there and Jacke hit the uprights on a field goal attempt from 49 yards. Dallas took over and stormed back on a 10-play, 45-yard drive, with Aikman's 22-yard completion to Smith and two more to Michael Irvin for 24 total yards. With 23 seconds left in the first half, Cowboys kicker Eddie Murray made a 41-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Dallas' Joe Fishback recovered Harris' second fumble of the day, this one forced by Kenneth Gant, and Aikman threw a 6-yard touchdown toss to tight end Jay Novacek, making the score 17–3 at halftime.\nIn the third quarter, Green Bay got a chance to come back when Terrell Buckley intercepted a pass from Aikman on the Packers 40-yard line. Green Bay then drove to the Cowboys 37, but on fourth down and 8, Favre's pass to tight end Ed West netted just six yards. Dallas took the ball back and stormed 65 yards in six plays, including an 18-yard catch by Irvin with a 15-yard face-mask penalty turning it into a 33-yard gain. On the last play, Irvin caught a 19-yard touchdown reception. Now down by 21 points, Green Bay countered with a 9-play, 82-yard drive, with Favre completing four consecutive passes, including a 30-yard gain to running back Darrell Thompson, and scoring on a 13-yard pass to Robert Brooks, cutting their deficit to 24–10 going into the fourth quarter.\nIn the final quarter, Green Bay lost multiple chances to get back into the game. First, Brooks' 43-yard punt return was nullified when Jim Jeffcoat deflected Favre's pass into the arms of defensive end Charles Haley on the next play. Dallas then drove 47 yards, including a 27-yard reception by Irvin, to score on Murray's 38-yard field goal and increase their lead to 27–10. The Packers responded with a drive from their 15 to the Dallas 15, but any hope of a miracle comeback was dashed on the 13th play when safety Darren Woodson ended the drive with an interception. In the last two minutes of the game, Green Bay scored on Favre's 29-yard touchdown throw to Sharpe, but by then the game was well out of reach.\nFavre finished the game with 331 passing yards, just one yard short of a Packers playoff record, and two touchdowns, but was picked off twice. His top target was Sharpe, who caught six passes for 128 yards. Aikman completed 28 of 37 passes for 302 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions, while Irvin recorded nine receptions for 126 yards. Butler had a sack, an interception, and a fumble recovery.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Packers and Cowboys. Green Bay won two of the previous three meetings.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 28, Houston Oilers 20.\nChiefs quarterback Joe Montana threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give his team a 28–20 win and put an end to Houston's 11-game winning streak, while Kansas City's defense terrorized Houston quarterback Warren Moon, forcing three turnovers and sacking him a playoff record nine times. Four different Chiefs defensive players (Albert Lewis, Joe Phillips, Bennie Thompson, and Derrick Thomas) finished the game with multiple sacks, three of whom (all except Thomas) didn't have two sacks during the entire season.\nOn the opening drive of the game, a heavy pass rush by Oilers defensive tackle Glenn Montgomery caused Montana to throw a rushed pass that was intercepted by Steve Jackson, who returned it 14 yards to the Chiefs 23-yard line. Houston went three-and-out, including Lewis' 9-yard sack of Moon on third down, but Al Del Greco kicked a 49-yard field goal to put them on the board. Then after forcing a punt, Moon led the Oilers 80 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed just 6:37, starting if off with a 16-yard completion to Gary Wellman and later completing a 30-yard pass to Wellman deep in Chiefs territory. Once inside the red zone, Moon threw an incompletion on third down, but Thomas was penalized for being offsides, and Moon threw a first down completion to Haywood Jeffires at the 2-yard line on the next play. Running back Gary Brown took the ball into the end zone from there, increasing Houston's lead to 10–0.\nIn the second quarter, Chiefs receiver Danan Hughes gave his team a big opportunity by returning a punt 35 yards to the Oilers 42-yard line. But Kansas City ended up empty handed at the end of a drive in which they squandered multiple chances to get into scoring range. First, Montana threw a pass to the end zone that was barely deflected away from receiver Willie Davis by the outstretched arm of cornerback Cris Dishman. On the next play, he completed a pass to J. J. Birden that moved the ball to the 5-yard line, only to see it wiped out by a false start penalty on John Alt. Then after a screen pass that gained nothing, Montana threw another pass to the end zone on third down, this one bouncing off the fingertips of a wide open Davis and forcing Kansas City to punt. Houston then drove to the Chiefs 10-yard line on a drive that included Moon's 16-yard scramble with an unnecessary roughness penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain. But after a penalty pushed them back to the 25, they too failed to score when Lewis knocked the ball out of Moon's hand as he pulled it back to throw and rookie linebacker Jaime Fields recovered the fumble. Montana completed a 22-yard pass to Davis on the first play after the turnover, and eventually the Chiefs reached the Houston 36-yard line. But Montana threw an incomplete pass on fourth and 1, and the score remained 10–0 at the end of the half.\nAfter forcing the Oilers to punt on the opening drive of the second half, Montana completed a 37-yard pass to Davis and a 14-yarder to Tim Barnett before finishing the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Keith Cash. Later in the quarter, Houston drove to the 48-yard line. But shortly before the end of the quarter, Charles Mincy made a clutch interception and returned the ball 12 yards to the Kansas City 14.\nIn the fourth quarter, Terry Hoage intercepted a pass from Montana at the Chiefs 25-yard line, setting up Del Greco's 43-yard field goal to make the score 13–7. But Kansas City quickly stormed back to take their first lead of the game, scoring in just three plays: a 22-yard completion from Montana to Cash, a 38-yard pass interference penalty against Houston, and Montana's 11-yard touchdown pass to Birden. Then on the first play of Houston's ensuing drive, Thomas forced a fumble from Moon that Dan Saleaumua recovered on the Oilers 13-yard line, setting up Montana's 18-yard touchdown pass to Davis. Moon then led the Oilers 80 yards with eight consecutive completions, including a 23-yard catch by Jeffires, to score on wide receiver Ernest Givins' 7-yard touchdown reception, making the score 21–20 with 3:35 left. But the Chiefs responded with a critical 41-yard completion from Montana to Cash on third and 1, setting up Marcus Allen's game clinching 21-yard touchdown run.\nHouston would not host another playoff game until 2011 and the franchise would not appear in the playoffs until 1999, their first season as the Tennessee Titans. This would be the Chiefs' last postseason victory until . This was Montana's 10th consecutive postseason game with a touchdown pass, tying the NFL record set by Ken Stabler. Montana threw for 299 yards and three touchdowns, with two interceptions. Moon completed 32 of 43 passes for 302 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Davis was the top receiver of the day with five receptions for 96 yards, while Jeffires caught nine passes for 88.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Oilers. The Chiefs won the only prior meeting as the Dallas Texans.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 23, 1994.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 30, Kansas City Chiefs 13.\nRunning back Thurman Thomas led the Bills to the 30–13 victory by recording 186 rushing yards, three receptions for 22 yards, and three touchdowns. Buffalo racked up a total of 229 rushing yards against a Chiefs defense that allowed only 39 rushing yards from Houston in the divisional round.\nBuffalo scored first on a drive that started on the Kansas City 47-yard line courtesy of Russell Copeland's 13-yard punt return. A few plays later, Andre Reed's 29-yard reception on third and 5 moved the ball to the 13-yard line, setting up Thurman Thomas' 12-yard touchdown run to give them a 7–0 lead. Building on the momentum of a 31-yard kickoff return by John Stephens and a 24-yard run by Marcus Allen, Kansas City responded with a 31-yard field goal by Nick Lowery. Then Kansas City caught a break when Copeland fumbled the ensuing kickoff while being hit by Bennie Thompson, and Fred Jones recovered for the Chiefs on the Bills 24-yard line. This led to Lowery's second field goal to make the score 7–6.\nThe Bills stormed back with 13 unanswered points. First they drove 80 yards in nine plays, including a 33-yard burst by Thomas and a 15-yard run by Kenneth Davis, to score on Thomas' 3-yard touchdown run. Then a third down sack by Jeff Wright forced a Kansas City punt from deep in their own territory, which Copeland returned 17 yards to the Chiefs 46-yard line. Buffalo subsequently drove to the 5-yard line where Steve Christie made a 23-yard field goal. After a Kansas City punt, a pair of double digit runs by Thomas set up a second Christie field goal to make the score 20–6 with just over two minutes left in the half. The Chiefs responded with a drive to the Buffalo 5-yard line, featuring a 31-yard completion from Joe Montana to running back Todd McNair, but with 21 seconds left before halftime, Montana's pass went through the hands of Kimble Anders and was intercepted by safety Henry Jones.\nMontana later suffered a concussion during the third play of the third quarter and left the game, replaced by Dave Krieg. Krieg's first two passes were incomplete, resulting in a punt that Copeland returned 26 yards into KC territory, but the Chiefs defense rose to the occasion and forced a punt. Krieg then led his team on a 90-yard drive, starting out with a 26-yard completion to J. J. Birden and later completing a 19-yarder to tight end Keith Cash on fourth down and 2, to score on a 1-yard touchdown run by Allen. However, Buffalo scored 10 unanswered points in the final quarter to preserve the victory. First they responded to the Chiefs touchdown with an 18-yard field goal by Christie. Then a sack by Phil Hansen forced Kansas City to punt, and Copeland again gave his team good field position with a return to the Bills 48-yard line, where the team started a 52-yard drive to put the game away on Thomas' 3-yard touchdown run.\nFor the Bills, this was the third straight year they defeated a future Hall of Fame quarterback to advance to the Super Bowl. They beat John Elway and his Denver Broncos in the 1991 AFC Championship Game and Dan Marino and his Miami Dolphins in 1992. For Montana, this was his seventh start in a conference championship game, the most of any quarterback, breaking his tie with Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach. (In 2013, Tom Brady surpassed Montana by starting in his eighth AFC Championship Game.) He also joined the select group to start in the conference championship for two different franchises, joining Craig Morton (Cowboys and Broncos), Doug Williams (Buccaneers and Redskins) and Jay Schroeder (Redskins and Raiders). This was also Kelly's fifth conference championship game which is tied for fifth most with Ken Stabler, Elway, Brett Favre and Donovan McNabb. Copeland finished with 138 all-purpose yards, including five punt returns for 70.\nIt was the first AFC Championship Game that was a rematch of a previous AFL Championship Game, the former taking place in 1966.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Bills. The teams split the prior two meetings.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 38, San Francisco 49ers 21.\nBefore the game, Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson famously guaranteed that his team would win, and his team did not disappoint. The Cowboys jumped to a 28–7 halftime lead, racking up 273 yards and 19 first downs, and scoring four touchdowns in their first five possessions. San Francisco finished the half with just 110 total yards and six first downs.\nDallas took the opening kickoff and marched 75 yards in 11 plays to score on running back Emmitt Smith's 5-yard touchdown. Five seconds into the second quarter, the 49ers finished a 9-play, 80-yard drive and tied the game on quarterback Steve Young's 7-yard touchdown pass to fullback Tom Rathman. But then the Cowboys scored three unanswered touchdowns to go up 28–7 before halftime. First they drove 80 yards in 11 plays to score on a 4-yard run by fullback Daryl Johnston. Then Thomas Everett intercepted the ball from Young and returned it 14 yards to the 49ers 24, setting up Smith's 11-yard touchdown reception from Troy Aikman. Five minutes later, Aikman finished a 72-yard drive with a 19-yard score to tight end Jay Novacek.\nOn Dallas' first series of the third quarter, Aikman suffered a game-ending concussion, knocking him so senseless that when a team doctor asked him where the Super Bowl was going to be played, he answered \"Henryetta\", Aikman's hometown in Oklahoma. Then with just over five minutes left in the third quarter, San Francisco running back Ricky Watters ran for a 4-yard touchdown to cut the lead to 28–14. However, 30-year-old Dallas backup quarterback Bernie Kosar responded by leading the Cowboys 82 yards to a momentum-shattering touchdown, including a critical 12-yard completion to Michael Irvin on third and 9 from the Dallas 19. On the last play, he connected with wide receiver Alvin Harper for a 42-yard touchdown. Cowboys kicker Eddie Murray later added a 50-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory.\nMostly due to Johnson's famous guarantee, ESPN named the game one of the 10 most memorable in the history of Texas Stadium in 2008. \"I don't think anybody in a million years thought it would be this type of game\", said 49ers coach George Seifert. \"I expected us to be more stout. In the early stages of the game, Dallas was extremely explosive and pretty much had their way with us.\"\nSadly, this would be CBS's final NFL telecast (due to their losing the NFC package to Fox in December 1993) before resuming coverage in 1998. CBS used a goodbye montage featuring the instrumental background \"After the Sunrise\" composed by Yanni.\nDallas had 377 yards of offense without any turnovers. Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns, while Kosar completed five of nine passes for 83 yards and a score. Smith was the Cowboys leading rusher and receiver with 88 rushing yards and seven receptions for 85 yards. Young threw for 287 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, while also rushing for 38 yards and a score. Watters, who rushed for over 100 yards and scored five touchdowns in the divisional round, had just 12 carries for 37 yards. This was the first NFC Championship Game featuring a rematch between both teams from the previous year since the 1971 season. Incidentally, that game also involved Cowboys defeating the 49ers for the second year in a row.\nAikman later said he had no memory of playing in this game. According to his agent, Leigh Steinberg, who spoke to Aikman at the hospital after the game, Aikman had to ask him where he was, why he was at the hospital, who he had been playing against, and if his team had won. Despite this, Aikman still returned to lead the Cowboys to victory in the Super Bowl just one week later.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the 49ers and Cowboys. Dallas won four of the previous five meetings.\nSuper Bowl XXVIII: Dallas Cowboys 30, Buffalo Bills 13.\nThis was the second consecutive Super Bowl meeting between the Cowboys and Bills. There has yet to be another Super Bowl matchup to occur in consecutive years as of 2021."

The postseason tournament concluded with the Dallas Cowboys defeating the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII, 52–17, on January 31, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, ABC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games. CBS then televised the rest of the NFC games. NBC broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games and Super Bowl XXVII.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 2, 1993.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 24, Minnesota Vikings 7.\nAlthough Minnesota scored on their opening drive of the game, they were quickly crushed by the Redskins, who massively outgained them in total yards 358–148, rushing yards 162–75, and time of possession 42:43 to 17:17. Vikings quarterback Sean Salisbury was held to just six of 20 completions, intercepted twice, and sacked four times (three by defensive end Fred Stokes).\nThe Vikings scored first on a 74-yard opening drive, featuring a 42-yard completion from Salisbury to Cris Carter, that ended with Terry Allen's 1-yard touchdown run. However, Washington controlled the game from that point on. Redskins Martin Mayhew's 44-yard interception return set up their first score on Chip Lohmiller's 44-yard field goal with 53 seconds left in the first quarter. Then less than five minutes into the second quarter, Redskins safety Brad Edwards picked off a pass from Salisbury and returned it six yards to the Vikings 33, and Washington cashed in on this turnover with Earnest Byner's 3-yard rushing touchdown, giving them a 10–7 lead.\nLate in the second quarter, the Redskins faced fourth down and 4 at the Minnesota 44-yard line. Running back Brian Mitchell rushed for 38 yards on a fake punt to give the team a first down, and later finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. Quarterback Mark Rypien's 24-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gary Clark in the third quarter closed out the scoring.\nMitchell, who had only 24 career rushing attempts coming into this game, led the Redskins with 109 rushing yards and 100 total yards on receptions and punt/kickoff returns.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Redskins and Vikings. Both teams have split the previous four meetings.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 17, Kansas City Chiefs 0.\nSan Diego entered this game as the first NFL team ever to make the playoffs after starting the season 0–4, and went on to shut out the Chiefs, outgaining them in total yards 342–251 and rushing yards 192–61. Kansas City never moved the ball farther than the Chargers 34-yard line. This was San Diego's first playoff win since the 1982 season.\nThe game remained scoreless until 5:53 remained in the third quarter when the Chargers faced second and 2. On the next play, running back Marion Butts took a pitch, ran through a large hole in the right side of the line, evaded a tackle attempt from safety Charles Mincy, and outraced the rest of the defense for a 54-yard rushing touchdown.\nLeslie O'Neal intercepted a pass from Dave Krieg at the Chiefs 26-yard line on Kansas City's next drive to set up kicker John Carney's 34-yard field goal. In the final quarter the Chargers put the game away with a 90-yard drive, featuring a 44-yard completion from Stan Humphries to Anthony Miller (Miller fumbled at the end, but it was recovered by running back Ronnie Harmon, who gained an additional 11 yards). Linebacker Steve Hendrickson, who lined up as a running back, finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run.\nIn addition to his interception, O'Neal also had two sacks. Chargers defensive ends Shawn Lee and Burt Grossman also had 4.5 sacks between them (two for Lee, 2.5 for Grossman). Butts finished the game with 119 rushing yards and a touchdown on just 15 carries, along with two receptions for 17 yards. Humphries threw for 199 yards without any interceptions.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Chargers.\nSunday, January 3, 1993.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 41, Houston Oilers 38 (OT).\nKnown as The Comeback, the Bills mounted what was then the greatest comeback in NFL history, overcoming a 35–3 (32-point) deficit against the Oilers. The Bills were without future Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly (who was injured in the last game of the season, a loss to the Oilers) and All-Pro linebacker Cornelius Bennett, and they lost Hall of Fame running back Thurman Thomas to a hip injury in the second half.\nHouston dominated the game early, as quarterback Warren Moon completed 19 of 22 passes for 220 yards and four touchdowns in the first half, while the Oilers held the ball for 21:12, keeping the Bills' high-powered offense off the field for most of the first two quarters. On the opening drive of the first quarter, Moon completed six of seven passes on an 80-yard scoring drive that took over nine minutes off the clock and ended it with his first touchdown throw to wide receiver Haywood Jeffires for three yards to give the Oilers a 7–0 lead. Buffalo responded on their ensuing drive, as Kenneth Davis returned the kickoff 33 yards to the 44-yard line. Frank Reich subsequently led the Bills to the Oilers 18-yard line where Steve Christie made a 36-yard field goal, to cut the score to 7–3. But Moon struck right back, leading the Oilers on a second quarter scoring drive that was nearly identical to their first one, completing six of seven passes on another 80-yard drive and finishing it with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter. Then after forcing the Bills to a three-and-out, Moon threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Curtis Duncan. Later on, with 1:15 left in the half, the Oilers drove for another touchdown, aided by an encroachment call against the Bills on fourth down and 1. Moon completed the drive with his second touchdown pass to Jeffires, this one a 27-yarder, and the Oilers went into their locker room with a 28–3 halftime lead.\n1:41 into the third quarter, Reich threw a pass that bounced off the hands of tight end Keith McKeller and Bubba McDowell returned the interception 58 yards for a touchdown, increasing the Houston lead to 35–3. However, on the kickoff, the wind shifted the ball just before it was kicked by Al Del Greco. As a result, it became an unintentional squib kick that the Bills recovered with great field position at midfield. Buffalo then drove 50 yards in 10 plays, including a 24-yard pass to tight end Pete Metzelaars that went right through the hands of linebacker Eddie Robinson, and scored with a 1-yard touchdown run by Davis, cutting the deficit to 35–10. On the drive, Reich completed a 16-yard pass to Andre Reed, while Davis kept the drive going with a 5-yard run on fourth down and 2 before finishing it off with a touchdown run with 8:52 left in the third quarter.\nChristie then recovered his own onside kick and the Bills scored on the fourth play of their ensuing drive with Reich's 38-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Don Beebe. One of Beebe's feet went partially out of bounds during the run before he made the catch, and it should have been ruled by the officials as an illegal touching of the football; this was pointed out on ESPN's \"NFL Primetime\" postgame recap as well as by Todd Christensen on the NBC broadcast. This made the score 35–17 with 7:46 left in the third quarter.\nHouston was then forced to punt for the first time in the game on their next drive, and Greg Montgomery's 25-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at their own 41-yard line. Reich started out the ensuing drive with an 18-yard completion to James Lofton. Davis gained 20 yards on a screen pass and then Reich threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Reed, trimming the lead to 35–24. Then on the first play of the Oilers' ensuing possession, Moon's pass was tipped off the hands of Slaughter; Bills' safety Henry Jones intercepted the pass from Moon and returned it 15 yards to the Houston 23-yard line. Three plays later, Buffalo faced fourth down and five on the 18-yard line. Rather than attempt a field goal, Reich connected with Reed for the touchdown. With the score (including the extra point), the Bills had cut their deficit from 32 points to four in a span of just 6:52. On the Oilers' next drive, linebacker Darryl Talley forced a fumble from Moon while sacking him. Houston recovered the fumble, but they were forced to punt, and Montgomery's 24-yard kick gave Buffalo the ball at its 48-yard line.\nThis time, the Bills could not take advantage of their excellent starting field position and had to punt. Moon's run and shoot offense began to move the ball effectively again. Despite two sacks by Jeff Wright on the drive, Houston reached the Buffalo 14-yard line. Del Greco attempted a field goal to increase the Oilers' lead, but Montgomery fumbled the snap and Talley recovered the ball on the 26-yard line. After two plays, the Bills faced third down and four. With Houston's defense dropping back and expecting a pass, Reich handed the ball off to Davis, who stormed through the line and took off for a 35-yard gain. Then Reich went back to passing the ball, completing a short pass to Reed at the Oilers' 17-yard line on third down and two for the first down. With just 3:08 left in the fourth quarter, Reich threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Reed, giving Buffalo its first lead of the game 38–35 (after the extra point); for the first time all season, the Houston defense (ninth in fewest points allowed that season) had allowed over 29 points. But Moon led Houston downfield on a 63-yard drive to score the tying 26-yard field goal from Del Greco to send the game into overtime. A key play on the drive was an 18-yard completion to Slaughter on fourth down and four from the Bills' 34-yard line.\nHouston won the coin toss and got the ball at its 20-yard line. Three plays later, Moon was intercepted by Nate Odomes, enabling Christie to kick a field goal and win the game.\nReich finished the game completing 21 of 34 passes for 289 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception. Reed had eight catches for 136 yards and three touchdowns. Davis rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 25 yards and returning a kickoff for 33 yards. Moon completed 36 of 50 attempts for 371 yards and four touchdowns, with two interceptions. His 36 completions set a playoff record that would stand until broken by Drew Brees's 39 completions in 2010 (Brees's New Orleans Saints also lost that game). Givens caught nine passes for 117 yards. Jeffires recorded eight catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Oilers and Bills. Buffalo won the only prior meeting.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 36, New Orleans Saints 20.\nThe Eagles overcame a 20–10 Saints lead late in the third quarter by scoring 26 points in the final quarter, just one point short of the NFL postseason record set by the New York Giants in 1934.\nNew Orleans scored after a 25-yard reception from Craig Heyward and an Eagles pass interference penalty that moved the ball 1-yard line set up Heyward's 1-yard touchdown run, but it was countered with Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham's 57-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Fred Barnett. The Saints then drove 71 yards in 13 plays to take a 10–7 lead on Morten Andersen's 35-yard field goal. Later on, they drove 53 yards in four plays to go up 17–7 on wide receiver Quinn Early's 7-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Bobby Hebert.\nOn the Saints' first drive of the third quarter, running back Vaughn Dunbar caught a short pass from Herbert and ran it 35 yards to the Eagles 34. But when faced with 3rd and 1 from the 25, Dunbar was tackled at the line and ruled short of a first down, causing New Orleans to settle for Andersen's 42-yard field goal that put them up 20–7. New Orleans quickly force a punt, but after they got the ball back, Hebert overthrew Early on a deep post pass, sending the ball right into the arms of Eagles cornerback Eric Allen for an interception on the Philadelphia 38-yard line. From there, the Eagles drove to a 40-yard Roger Ruzek field goal that cut their deficit to 20–10 going into the fourth quarter.\nThe Saints final six drives of the second half resulted in an interception, a punt, another interception, a safety, another interception, and time expiring in the game. Their possession after Ruzek's field goal ended when Hebert underthrew the ball on a pass attempt to a wide open Eric Martin on 3rd and 1. Then Cunningham closed the gap to 20–17 with a 35-yard touchdown completion to Barnett with less than 11 minutes left in regulation. Then on the first play of the Saints' next possession, Eagles linebacker Seth Joyner intercepted a pass from Hebert and returned it 14 yards to the Saints 26 to set up running back Heath Sherman's 6-yard touchdown run, giving Philadelphia the lead, 24–20. After New Orleans got the ball back, Eagles defensive end Reggie White sacked Hebert in the end zone for a safety. After the free kick, Ruzek added a 39-yard field goal. 19 seconds later, Allen intercepted Hebert and returned the ball 18 yards for a touchdown.\n\"I thought I had the first down and got a bad spot,\" said Dunbar of the play where he was ruled short on 3rd and 1. \"It seemed kind of meaningless at the time, because we got the field goal. Now, in hindsight, it could have been that final nail in the Eagles' coffin.\"\nCunningham completed 19 of 35 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 19 yards. Sherman rushed for a 105 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 17 yards. Barnett had four receptions for 102 yards and two scores. Allen had two interceptions. Dunbar had 115 all-purpose yards. This was Philadelphia's first playoff win since the 1980 season, ending a five-game losing streak which began in the Louisiana Superdome with Super Bowl XV.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Eagles and Saints.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 9, 1993.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 24, Pittsburgh Steelers 3.\nThe Bills forced four fumbles, three turnovers, and seven sacks as they held the Steelers to just a field goal. Buffalo quarterback Frank Reich threw for 160 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions; while running back Kenneth Davis rushed for 104 yards. Steelers running back Barry Foster rushed for 104 yards and caught a pass for seven yards. Pittsburgh had led the NFL with 43 takeaways during the season, but they were not able to force any in this game.\nOn the opening drive of the game, the Bills drove to the Pittsburgh 46-yard line. But on fourth and 1, fullback Carwell Gardner was stuffed by linebackers David Little and Hardy Nickerson for no gain. The turnover on downs led to Gary Anderson's 38-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh a 3–0 lead. However, Steelers quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who had missed the last three games of the season with a leg injury, ended up turning the ball over three times on the team's next four drives. First he threw a pass that was deflected by Phil Hansen into the arms of Nate Odomes for an interception. Following a punt from each team, Bruce Smith forced a fumble from O'Donnell, which Hansen recovered on the Bills 41-yard line. Buffalo then advanced 59 yards, including a 19-yard catch by receiver Don Beebe on the Steelers 1-yard line. On the next play, the team scored on Reich's 1-yard touchdown pass to Mitch Frerotte, an eligible offensive lineman playing out of the fullback position. Although there would be no more scoring in the first half, Pittsburgh's struggles would continue. On their next drive, O'Donnell was intercepted by James Williams.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Bills moved the ball 80 yards and scored with Reich's 17-yard touchdown pass to James Lofton, increasing their lead to 14–3. On the play before the touchdown, Reich had thrown the ball right into the hands of defensive back Richard Shelton while trying to connect with Beebe, but Shelton dropped the pass, costing his team what would have been an easy touchdown return. \"I was just running before I caught the ball, and that really hurt\", Shelton said after the game. \"I could have had six.\"\nIn the final quarter, a botched Steelers field goal attempt set up a 44-yard drive that ended with Bills kicker Steve Christie's 43-yard field goal. The next time Buffalo got the ball, they drove 86 yards and scored on a 1-yard run from Gardner.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Bills and Steelers. Pittsburgh won the only previous meeting.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 20, Washington Redskins 13.\nDespite committing four turnovers, 49ers quarterback Steve Young passed for 227 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for 73 yards, to beat the Redskins.\nOn their first drive, San Francisco advanced 83 yards, including a 35-yard reception by Jerry Rice and a 22-yard catch by tight end Brent Jones, to score on Young's 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Taylor that went off the hands of Redskins safety A. J. Johnson. The 49ers seemed to be in prime position to score again when Kelly Goodburn's 29-yard punt gave them a first down on the Washington 49, but Fred Stokes eventually stripped the ball from Young and safety Brad Edwards recovered the fumble. Washington then drove 61 yards to cut the score to 7–3 on a 19-yard field goal by Chip Lohmiller.\nSan Francisco responded with a 23-yard field goal from Mike Cofer to go up 10–3 in the second quarter. Then after forcing a punt, they moved the ball from their own 1-yard line to the Redskins 29, but lost another turnover when Johnson intercepted Young's pass at the 5. However, Washington promptly gave the ball back when running back Brian Mitchell lost a fumble that was recovered by David Whitmore with 1:09 left in the half. Four plays later, Young threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Jones, who fumbled the ball when hit by Edwards at the 1, but managed to recover it in the end zone to give San Francisco a 17–3 halftime lead.\nIn the second half, Washington converted two Young fumbles into 10 points. The 49ers got a great scoring opportunity after Whitmore intercepted a pass from Mark Rypien in the third quarter. But while scrambling for a first down, Young lost a fumble without being touched and linebacker Monte Coleman recovered it. This led to a 71-yard drive finished off by Lohmiller's 32-yard field goal, cutting Washington's deficit to 17–6. On the next series, the ball again slipped out of Young's hands, this time on a pass attempt, and Redskins defensive lineman Charles Mann recovered it on the San Francisco 15-yard line. Three plays later, Rypien scored on a 1-yard sneak, cutting the deficit to 17–13 early in the fourth quarter.\nFollowing a 49ers punt, Washington moved the ball 52 yards to the 49ers 23-yard line. But with 9:52 left, Mitchell fumbled a botched handoff attempt by Rypien and linebacker Michael Walter recovered the fumble. San Francisco then marched 59 yards in 14 plays, featuring a 16-yard completion from Young to Rice on third and 10, on a drive that consumed more than seven minutes off the clock and scored on Cofer's game-clinching 33-yard field goal, making the score 20–13. Washington got the ball back with 2:15 remaining and had one last chance to drive for a tying score, but they could only advance a few yards before turning the ball over on downs, as Rypien's final two passes were dropped by wide open targets, receiver Ricky Sanders and tight end Ron Middleton.\n49ers running back Ricky Watters was the game's top rusher with 83 yards, while also catching two passes for 19. Defensive end Pierce Holt had three of San Francisco's five sacks. Redskins receiver Gary Clark caught seven passes for 100 yards. This was the last game of Joe Gibbs' first tenure as Redskins head coach. Washington would not return to the playoffs again until 1999.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Redskins and 49ers. San Francisco won two of the previous three meetings.\nSunday, January 10, 1993.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 34, Philadelphia Eagles 10.\nThe Cowboys defense had five sacks (two each by linemen Russell Maryland and Tony Tolbert), and held the Eagles offense to 178 yards and 10 points.\nPhiladelphia scored on the opening drive of the game, holding the ball for seven minutes on the way to a 32-yard field goal by kicker Roger Ruzek, but then Dallas scored 34 consecutive points. Kelvin Martin returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards to the Eagles 46, sparking a 10-play drive that ended on Troy Aikman's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Derek Tennell, who had been signed by the team as a free agent only a week before this game. After the next three drives from each team ended in punts, Aikman completed a 41-yard pass to Alvin Harper on the Philadelphia 14-yard line with 1:04 left in the half. Following an 8-yard scramble by Aikman, he finished the 67-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jay Novacek. Then Darren Woodson forced a fumble from Vai Sikahema on the following kickoff, which Thomas Everett recovered for Dallas on the Eagles 29. This enabled Lin Elliott to kick a 20-yard field goal before halftime that put them up 17–3.\nIn the third quarter, Dallas held the ball for more than 12 minutes and gained 176 yards, while holding the Eagles to -16. Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith, who finished the game with 114 rushing yards, scored a 23-yard touchdown run on the opening drive of the second half. Elliott later kicked a 43-yard field goal to put the team up 27–3.\nLate in the fourth quarter, Smith was taken out of the game and got to watch Derrick Gainer carry the ball nine times for 29 yards on an 11-play, 80-yard drive that ended on Gainer's 1-yard touchdown run. Meanwhile, all the Eagles could do was score a meaningless touchdown on Randall Cunningham's 18-yard pass to Calvin Williams with 50 seconds left in the game.\nAikman completed 15/25 passes for 200 yards and two touchdowns. Cunningham finished the game 17/30 for 160 yards and one touchdown, along with 25 rushing yards.\n\"There was a lot of talking before this game\", said Cowboys linebacker Ken Norton Jr. \"We did our talking on the field. I don't think they have too much they can say right now.\"\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Eagles and Cowboys. Philadelphia won the only prior meeting.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 31, San Diego Chargers 0.\nThe Dolphins defense shut out the Chargers, holding San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries to just 18 of 44 completions for 140 yards and intercepting him four times as they snuffed out San Diego's eight-game winning streak. Overall, San Diego gained just 202 yards and 10 first downs, while losing five turnovers. The Chargers had seven sacks in their wild card win against Kansas City, but none in this game.\nDolphins quarterback Dan Marino threw three touchdown passes in the second quarter, all of them set up by interceptions. With 11:30 remaining in the second quarter, rookie Troy Vincent intercepted a pass from Humphries and returned it two yards to the San Diego 48. Nine plays later, Miami cashed in with Marino's 1-yard touchdown pass to Tony Paige. With less than two minutes left in the half, Humphries threw a pass that slipped out of the hands of receiver Nate Lewis and was picked off by Vincent on the Chargers 37. Marino threw a 28-yard completion to Mark Duper on the next play, and finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown toss to tight end Keith Jackson. Then on the fourth play after the ensuing kickoff, linebacker Bryan Cox intercepted a pass intended for Shawn Jefferson and returned it seven yards to the San Diego 42. Four plays later, Marino's 30-yard touchdown pass to Jackson gave Miami a 21–0 halftime lead.\nIn the second half, Miami relied primarily on their running game to protect their lead. Running back Aaron Craver led the team with eight carries for 72 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown burst in the fourth quarter. Before that, the Dolphins also scored on a 22-yard field goal from kicker Pete Stoyanovich. The final score of 31–0 marked a record setting day for the Dolphins offense, who had scored just six touchdowns in the last six games. Their 21 points was the highest single quarter amount they had ever scored in a playoff game, and their 31-point margin of victory was also a franchise postseason record.\nMarino finished the game with 167 passing yards and three touchdowns. Running back Bobby Humphrey rushed for 71 yards and caught three passes for 30. Miami also got a big performance out of punter Reggie Roby, who planted four of his eight punts inside the Chargers 20-yard line, including three that were inside the 7. Lewis gained 130 all-purpose yards, including four kickoff returns for 111. San Diego linebacker Junior Seau had 18 tackles.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Chargers and Dolphins. Both teams split the previous two meetings.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 17, 1993.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 29, Miami Dolphins 10.\nThe Bills intercepted Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino twice, recovered three fumbles, forced four sacks, and held Miami to just 33 rushing yards. Jim Kelly returned to quarterback the Bills after an injury kept him out of the first two postseason games, and Buffalo had a rusty time getting offensive scores. However, kicker Steve Christie made an NFL playoff record-tying five field goals while key players stepped up on both sides as the Bills rushed their way into history. Thurman Thomas, who had been knocked out of the game in both of the Bills prior two playoff contests, rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 70, while Kenneth Davis added 61 rushing yards and four receptions for 52.\nMidway through the first quarter, Bills defensive end Bruce Smith forced a fumble from Marino while sacking him, and linebacker Darryl Talley recovered it, setting up a 21-yard field goal by Christie. Miami struck back on their next drive with a 51-yard field goal from Pete Stoyanovich. After the ensuing kickoff, Kelly led the Bills 64 yards in seven plays and finished the drive with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Thomas early in the second quarter. Later on, Buffalo defensive end Phil Hansen intercepted a pass from Marino on the Dolphins 24-yard line, setting up Christie's second field goal and giving the Bills a 13–3 lead by the end of the first half.\nOn the opening kickoff of the second half, Miami returner Mike Williams fumbled the ball while being tackled by Mark Pike, and Buffalo's Carwell Gardner recovered it at the Dolphins 25-yard line. Five plays later, Davis scored on a 2-yard touchdown run, giving the Bills a 20–3 lead. Buffalo's defense took over the rest of the third quarter, holding the Dolphins offense to two offensive yards while Christie added two more field goals to increase their lead to 26–3. Marino completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Duper in the final quarter. However, Christie kicked his fifth field goal of the game to clinch the victory.\nThis was the second straight year the Bills defeated a future Hall of Fame quarterback to advance to the Super Bowl as they beat John Elway and his Denver Broncos 10–7 a season earlier. The Bills became the first team in 19 years to reach the Super Bowl in three straight seasons (the last being the 1971-1973 Miami Dolphins); no other team would win three straight Conference Championships until the 2016-2018 New England Patriots.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Bills and Dolphins. Buffalo won the only previous meeting.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 30, San Francisco 49ers 20.\nEven though the Cowboys had only one more yard of total offense than the 49ers (416–415), Dallas forced four critical turnovers that helped them earn the win. On San Francisco's first drive of the game, a controversial holding penalty on guard Guy McIntyre nullified a 63-yard touchdown completion from quarterback Steve Young to wide receiver Jerry Rice, and the 49ers had to punt. Despite a 19-yard reception from Michael Irvin on the Cowboys first play, they also had to punt, but returner Alan Grant fumbled after a hit from Dixon Edwards and Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston recovered on the 49ers 22. The Cowboys restarted their drive with a completion to Irvin, this one a 21-yard gain to the 1-yard line. But the San Francisco defense managed to hold them up on three consecutive plays, forcing Dallas to settle for Lin Elliott's 20-yard field goal.\nSan Francisco running back Marc Logan returned the ensuing kickoff 50 yards to the Cowboys 48-yard line. Aided by a 16-yard run from Ricky Watters, San Francisco drove 48 yards and scored with Young's 1-yard touchdown run to take a 7–3 lead. Dallas was forced to punt on their next drive after Troy Aikman was sacked twice (one by Bill Romanowski and the other by Martin Harrison) for 19 total yards, and Grant returned the football to the Cowboys 47-yard line. San Francisco then drove to the Dallas 29-yard line, but the drive stalled there and Mike Cofer missed a 47-yard field goal try. After a punt, Watters lost a fumble that was recovered by defensive back Kevin Smith. Aided by a defensive holding call against Pierce Holt for holding up running back Emmitt Smith at the line on third down (the 49ers objected, stating that Holt was fooled by a fake handoff into thinking Smith actually had the ball), Dallas took a 10–7 lead with Smith's 4-yard touchdown run. A 21-yard reception by Rice sparked a 49ers drive to the Cowboys 10-yard line where Cofer made a 28-yard field goal to tie the game with less than two minutes left in the second quarter. Cofer's kickoff went out of bounds, giving Dallas a chance to score before the end of the half. Aikman managed to lead them to the 49ers 25-yard line, but Elliott's 43-yard field goal attempt went wide right and it was tied at 10 going into halftime.\nAfter receiving the second half kickoff, the Cowboys marched 78 yards, featuring a 38-yard leaping catch by Alvin Harper over Eric Davis, to score on Johnston's 3-yard touchdown run to take a 17–10 lead.\nThe 49ers struck back with a 35-yard completion from Young to Rice that set up a 43-yard field goal by Cofer, cutting the score to 17–13. However, Dallas put together a 79-yard drive which consumed nine minutes with a key 31-yard reception by tight end Jay Novacek. This second long drive was capped by Aikman's 16-yard touchdown pass to Smith, giving the Cowboys a 24–13 advantage.\nOn the ensuing drive for San Francisco midway into the fourth, Cowboys linebacker Ken Norton Jr. intercepted a pass from Young and returned it to the 49ers 45-yard line, and Dallas subsequently marched to the 7. Rather than attempt a field goal on fourth down and 1, Smith attempted to run for the first down, but was tackled by linebacker Michael Walter for no gain. The 49ers then drove 93 yards to score on Rice's 5-yard touchdown reception, cutting the lead to 24–20 with 4:22 left in the game. But on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Aikman threw a 14-yard pass to Harper, who ended up running for a 70-yard gain to the San Francisco 9-yard line. Three plays later, wide receiver Kelvin Martin scored on a 6-yard touchdown reception, making it 30–20 (the extra point was blocked) with 3:43 to play. The 49ers attempted one last drive to come back, but Young was intercepted, this time by free safety James Washington at the 2:00 warning, thus ending any hope of a 49er comeback.\nAikman threw for 322 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. Smith rushed for 24 carries and 114 yards, caught seven passes for 59 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Harper caught three passes for 117 yards. Defensive tackle Tony Casillas recorded three sacks. Meanwhile, Young recorded 313 passing yards and one touchdown, but threw two interceptions in the fourth quarter. Rice caught eight passes for 123 yards and a score. Watters rushed for 69 yards and caught six passes for 69. In the Cowboys post-game locker room speech cameras caught coach Jimmy Johnson saying \"How Bout Them Cowboys\" which has become a popular expression. This game stood as the last road playoff win for the Cowboys until 30 years later in the 2022-23 playoffs.\nThis was later featured on NFL's Greatest Games as Changing of the Guard.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Cowboys and 49ers. Dallas won three of the four meetings.\nSuper Bowl XXVII: Dallas Cowboys 52, Buffalo Bills 17.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Bills and Cowboys."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1991 season began on December 28, 1991. The postseason tournament concluded with the Washington Redskins defeating the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVI, 37–24, on January 26, 1992, at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, ABC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games, then NBC broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games. CBS televised the rest of the NFC games.\nSuper Bowl XXVI was the last Super Bowl to air on CBS until Super Bowl XXXV at the end of the 2000–01 playoffs. CBS lost the NFC package to Fox following the 1993 season, leaving the network without the NFL until it acquired the AFC package from NBC for the 1998 season.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 28, 1991.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 10, Los Angeles Raiders 6.\nChiefs quarterback Steve DeBerg completed a play-action 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Fred Jones in the second quarter, which was the difference in Kansas City's narrow 10–6 win over long-time rival Los Angeles. Kansas City running back Barry Word was arguably the Chiefs' most effective offensive weapon, rushing for 133 yards. This was Kansas City's first postseason win since Super Bowl IV in the 1969 season. The Raiders started rookie quarterback Todd Marinovich over veteran Jay Schroeder. Marinovich, who performed well in a loss to Kansas City the week before, instead threw four interceptions in the wild card rematch, including the one to Deron Cherry that set up DeBerg's touchdown. Kansas City's defense managed to hold Los Angeles to six points despite losing star linebacker Derrick Thomas, who was diagnosed with a rapid heartbeat and rushed to the hospital near the end of the first half.\nThe Chiefs controlled most of the first quarter, with Word rushing for 36 yards on 13 carries, but missed a chance to score when their normally reliable kicker Nick Lowery missed a 33-yard field goal. Marinovich promptly gave the Chiefs another scoring chance with an interception to Cherry, who returned the ball 17 yards. However, their ensuing drive ended with another missed field goal from Lowery, a 47-yard attempt early in the second quarter. On the Raiders' next drive, Cherry intercepted Marinovich again, this time returning the ball 29 yards to the LA 11-yard line. DeBerg then put Kansas City up 7–0 with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jones. However, Marinovich finally managed to compose himself, putting together a 10-play, 65-yard drive that culminated with Jeff Jaeger's 33-yard field goal, cutting the deficit to 7–3 with 26 seconds left in the half.\nMarinovich, who was rattled in the first half, found a rhythm in the second half, leading the team 62 yards in 11 plays with their first drive. Running back Nick Bell, who finished the game with 107 rushing yards, gained 46 yards on eight carries, while Jaeger finished the possession with a 26-yard field goal that made the score 7–6. Later in the quarter, LA appeared to be headed for a go-ahead score. But linebacker Lonnie Marts managed to force a fumble from Marcus Allen and defensive tackle Dan Saleaumua recovered the ball. Kansas City then drove 61 yards to the Raiders' 1-yard line where Lowery's 18-yard field goal in the fourth quarter put the Chiefs up 10–6.\nLos Angeles responded with a drive to the Kansas City 25, but after linebacker Chris Martin sacked Marinovich for an 8-yard loss, Eric Everett intercepted the ball and returned it 23 yards. Still, the Raiders defense held firm, forcing a punt that gave their offense one last chance to drive for a game winning score. Marinovich's 28-yard completion to tight end Ethan Horton and an 8-yard completion to running back Steve Smith moved the ball to the Chiefs' 24-yard line. However, the team suddenly self-destructed in a barrage of penalties. Right tackle Steve Wright was flagged for a face mask and a false start on consecutive snaps, and then an offensive pass interference penalty on Tim Brown left the team facing first and 30 from their own 41. On the next play, Marinovich's pass bounced off the hands of Horton and was intercepted by Marts with 2:15 left in regulation, enabling Kansas City to run out the rest of the clock.\nThe game was also significant in that it featured what was at the time the oldest starting player in the NFL (DeBerg; age 38) and the second-youngest player to start at quarterback in a playoff game: Marniovich at age 22 (Cleveland's Bernie Kosar being the youngest).\n\"This is the first playoff game I have ever won\", said DeBerg after the game. \"I'm going to enjoy it and hopefully this won't be the last one I get to enjoy. Todd was in a tough situation. He made some plays. But in the playoffs, for a rookie to get the job done...it is very, very difficult.\"\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Raiders and Chiefs. Both teams split the previous two meetings as members of the AFL.\nNFC: Atlanta Falcons 27, New Orleans Saints 20.\nFalcons quarterback Chris Miller completed the game-winning 61-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Haynes with 2:41 left in the contest. Miller completed 18 out of 30 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.\nThe Saints scored first on a 78-yard drive in which they started with a punt after three plays, but kept the ball due to a roughing the punter penalty against Tracy Johnson. Quarterback Bobby Hebert completed five passes on the drive, the last a 26-yard touchdown to wide receiver Floyd Turner. On the Saints' next drive, they moved the ball all the way to the Falcons' 3-yard line. But tight end John Tice dropped a catchable pass and then Deion Sanders intercepted Hebert's pass in the end zone to avoid a facing a fourteen-point deficit. In the second quarter, Morten Andersen's 45-yard field goal gave the Saints a 10–0 lead.\nThe Falcons later got a huge break when an apparent fumble by Mike Rozier was ruled down on contact on the field and instant replay couldn't reverse it. On the next play, Miller threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to Andre Rison. With 37 seconds left in the half, Atlanta tied the game on Norm Johnson's 44-yard field goal. However, Saints running back Fred McAfee returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards, with a facemask penalty against Sanders adding five more and giving New Orleans the ball on the Falcons' 41. On the next play, Hebert completed a 26-yard pass to running back Dalton Hilliard, enabling New Orleans to retake the lead before halftime, 13–10, on Andersen's 35-yard field goal.\nAtlanta started off the second half with a 9-play, 80-yard drive to take their first lead of the game on Miller's 20-yard scoring pass to Haynes. The rest of the quarter would belong to the Saints, who consumed a franchise playoff record 10:49 by driving 80 yards in 19 plays and going back up 20–17 with a 1-yard touchdown run by Hilliard. New Orleans was aided by another key penalty against the Falcons defense, an offsides penalty against linebacker Jessie Tuggle on an Andersen field goal attempt that gave the Saints a first down. With 7:43 left in the game, Johnson kicked a field goal to tie the score at 20 at the end of a 45-yard drive. The next time they got the ball, Haynes took off past cornerback Milton Mack, caught a short slant from Miller, and raced 61 yards to the end zone, giving Atlanta a 27–20 lead. After Haynes scored the winning touchdown for the Falcons, the Saints reached the Atlanta 35-yard line before Hebert threw an interception to Falcons corner Tim McKyer to clinch the victory.\nHaynes caught six passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns. McAfee rushed for 49 yards and returned four kickoffs for 98. Saints defensive tackle Frank Warren had two of New Orleans's five sacks.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Falcons and Saints.\nSunday, December 29, 1991.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 17, Chicago Bears 13.\nThe Cowboys jumped to a 10–0 first quarter lead and held on to win their first playoff game in nine years. Although Chicago outgained the Cowboys in total yards 372–288 and first downs 26–15, Dallas forced three turnovers and three sacks, while giving up none of either on their side of the ball. They also forced two turnovers on downs inside their own 10-yard line.\nBill Bates set up the first score of the game by forcing a fumble from Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh on the opening drive, which defensive end Tony Hill recovered at midfield, leading to Ken Willis's 27-yard field goal. Then Cowboys linebacker Darrick Brownlow blocked a punt that was recovered by linebacker Ken Norton Jr. at the Chicago 10-yard line, setting up a 1-yard touchdown by running back Emmitt Smith.\nIn the second quarter, Chicago moved the ball 68 yards to the Cowboys' 2-yard line. On third and 1, Harbaugh was stuffed for no gain by linebacker Jack Del Rio, and Neal Anderson was dropped by Tony Tolbert on the next play. This experience would be repeated later when Chicago drove 77 yards to the 2-yard line again, with rookie Darren Lewis rushing four times for 37 yards and catching a pass for 11. On second and goal, Norton tackled Anderson at the 1, and then he and Tolbert dropped Anderson for no gain on the next play. Rather than try another fourth-down conversion, Chicago settled for Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal to make the score 10–3 with 15 seconds left in the half.\nButler narrowed the gap to 10–6 with a 43-yard field goal, but Dallas responded with a 75-yard, 14-play drive to go up 17–6 on Steve Beuerlein's 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jay Novacek. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove to the Dallas 7-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs with Harbaugh's fourth-down incompletion. Following a Cowboys punt, Chicago managed to score their first touchdown on Harbaugh's 6-yard touchdown pass to Tom Waddle, cutting the deficit to 17–13. Their defense then forced a three-and-out, giving Chicago a chance to drive for the winning touchdown. However, this was made difficult by Mike Saxon's 52-yard punt, which pinned the Bears back on their own 4-yard line with 1:50 left in regulation. Three plays later, Bates intercepted a pass from Harbaugh on the Bears' 16, enabling Dallas to run out the clock.\n\"We're on a mission to kind of make a name for ourselves\", Dallas nose tackle Russell Maryland said. \"People said a couple of years ago that our defense was like a three-ring circus out there. Now we're out to prove that we're the greatest show on earth.\" \"We just don't get any credit\", added safety Ray Horton, describing a defense that did not have any Pro Bowl selections. \"We come up and do what we have to do. Hey, we've won 12 games! Other higher-ranked defenses are at home right now. So it's not like we're riding the coattails of our offense.\"\nSmith finished the game with 105 rushing yards and a touchdown, the most rushing yards ever allowed by Chicago in a playoff game. Waddle caught nine passes for 104 yards and a score.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Bears. Dallas won the only prior meeting.\nAFC: Houston Oilers 17, New York Jets 10.\nAfter leading 14–10 at halftime, the Oilers stopped the Jets twice inside the 5-yard line in the second half to preserve the victory.\nHouston got the ball first and on their opening play, they lost three yards on a screen pass. Once that was done, quarterback Warren Moon got them rolling all the way to the end zone. Despite two fumbled snaps on the drive, he completed 8/10 passes for 64 yards, including a 24-yarder to Haywood Jeffires, on a 16-play, 80-yard drive that took 9:14 off the clock and ended with his 5-yard touchdown pass to receiver Ernest Givins. New York had to punt on their first possession, but got the ball back with great field position when Erik McMillan intercepted Moon's pass on the Oilers' 39-yard line. The Jets then cashed in on their opportunity with a 9-play drive to score on Ken O'Brien's 10-yard touchdown pass to Al Toon, who made an athletic catch in the back of the end zone while barely managing to keep his feet in bounds. Later on, Bo Orlando intercepted a long pass from O'Brien on the Oilers' 25, and Moon led the team to a touchdown from there, completing passes to Drew Hill and Givins for 20 and 35 yards before Givins's 20-yard touchdown reception made the score 14–7 with 3:56 left in the half. New York ended up punting, but at the 1:10 mark, Houston's Al Del Greco missed a 46-yard field goal wide right. O'Brien then completed a pair of passes to Toon for 36 total yards on a drive to the Oilers' 16-yard line where Raúl Allegre kicked a 33-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 14–10 going into halftime.\nThe Jets then took the opening kickoff of the second half and marched to the Houston 8-yard line, but O'Brien threw an interception to Bubba McDowell. Houston took the ball back at their own 3-yard line and moved into scoring range. Despite two sacks by the Jets on the drive, Moon completed 7/8 passes, including a 17-yarder to running back Lorenzo White, moving the team close enough for Del Greco to make a franchise postseason record 53-yard field goal to increase their lead to 17–10.\nNew York responded with a drive to the Oilers' 3-yard line. Facing fourth down and inches, running back Freeman McNeil tried to advance the ball but was tackled for no gain. Late in the game, New York had another chance to score when safety Lonnie Young forced a fumble while sacking Moon and Tony Stargell recovered for the Jets on the Oilers' 26-yard line, but they turned it over on downs again. With just over a minute left, New York managed to get the ball back for one last drive, but McDowell intercepted a pass from O'Brien on the game's final play.\nMoon completed 28/40 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Toon caught eight passes for 91 yards and a score. New York linebacker Mo Lewis had two sacks.\nThis would be the final post-season victory for the Houston Oilers; as by the time of the franchise's next postseason victory; the team had relocated from Houston to Nashville and had been renamed the Tennessee Titans.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Jets and Oilers.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 4, 1992.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 24, Atlanta Falcons 7.\nDuring their regular season meeting, Washington defeated Atlanta 56–17, with quarterback Mark Rypien throwing for 446 yards and six touchdowns. Atlanta starting quarterback Chris Miller and cornerback Deion Sanders missed that initial meeting however. In this game the score was closer, but the result was still the same.\nUnder rainy and muddy conditions, the Falcons' pass-happy run-and-shoot offense turned the ball over six times, with Miller, who had problems all game with his footing, throwing four interceptions and getting sacked four times. The Redskins held the ball for over 36 minutes, scoring two touchdowns in a span of 3:11 in the second quarter. Washington scored first by driving 81 yards to score on running back Ricky Ervins's 17-yard rushing touchdown. Then, Redskins defensive end Charles Mann forced a fumble from Pat Chaffey that was recovered by Jumpy Geathers, giving the Redskins a first down on the Falcons 39-yard line. Following two runs by Earnest Byner for 11 yards, Rypien completed a 26-yard pass to Ricky Sanders on the 2, and Gerald Riggs ran the ball into the end zone on the next play.\nNow up 14–0 with 9:25 left in the second quarter, Washington squandered multiple chances to build a 3-score lead. A blitz from Washington cornerback A. J. Johnson caused Miller to throw a wobbly pass that was intercepted by Martin Mayhew on the Falcons' 29-yard line. But after driving to the 10, Rypien returned the favor with an interception to Atlanta safety Brian Jordan. The Redskins quickly got another chance to score due to an interception by linebacker Kurt Gouveia, but this drive also ended with no points, due to a missed 37-yard field goal attempt from Chip Lohmiller. Atlanta then drove 80 yards to score on Tracy Johnson's 1-yard touchdown run with 57 seconds left in the half, while Lohmiller missed a 44-yard field goal attempt as time in the second quarter ran out, his third miss of the day. So despite three first-half turnovers, Atlanta went into their locker room trailing only 14–7.\nIn the second half, the Redskins nearly faced disaster when long snapper John Brandes bounced his snap to punter Kelly Goodburn along the ground, but Goodburn managed to pick the ball up and kick a 37-yard punt just in time. \"Your reflexes take over\", Goodburn said after the game. \"It happened so fast that you just react. Fortunately, I got them off. I was a shortstop in high school. That might have helped.\" The play turned out to be crucial, as Washington's defense forced the Falcons to go three-and-out on their next possession. Then Brian Mitchell returned Scott Fulhage's 34-yard punt 26 yards to the Atlanta 18-yard line. The Redskins only managed to move the ball 11 yards, but this time Lohmiller cashed in with a 24-yard field goal, giving Washington a 17–7 lead.\nThe third quarter ended just over six minutes later, shortly after a missed 45-yard field goal attempt by Falcons kicker Norm Johnson, which turned out to be Atlanta's last chance to get back in the game. Less than two minutes into the fourth quarter, Falcons receiver Michael Haynes lost a fumble while being tackled by Gouveia, which linebacker Wilber Marshall recovered on the Redskins' 48-yard line. Washington then managed to grind out a 52-yard drive to put the game away, with Ervins rushing for 28 yards and Rypien converting two third downs with completions to receiver Gary Clark. He threw an incomplete pass intended for Ervins on third down from the 8, but Sanders was penalized for holding, giving Washington first and goal from the four. Riggs then took the ball into the end zone with two carries, the second a 1-yard rushing touchdown, giving Washington a 24–7 lead with 6:32 left in the game, prompting the fans in attendance to shower the field with the yellow seat cushions that were given out before the game and chant \"We want Dallas\".\n\"Well, it's great\", Washington coach Joe Gibbs said after the game, \"but to tell you the truth, I don't want either Dallas or Detroit. They'll both be tough. But we'll wait and see what happens and take our chances.\"\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Falcons and Redskins.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 26, Houston Oilers 24.\nTrailing 24–23 with 2:07 left in the game, quarterback John Elway led the Broncos 87 yards from their own 2-yard line to the winning 28-yard field goal by David Treadwell with 16 seconds left. On the drive, he converted on two fourth downs. On fourth down and 6 from the Denver 28, he rushed for seven yards. Then on fourth down and 10, he completed a 44-yard pass to wide receiver Vance Johnson.\nThe Oilers jumped to a 14–0 lead with quarterback Warren Moon's two touchdown passes to wide receivers Haywood Jeffires and Drew Hill for 15 and nine yards, respectively. Elway then completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Johnson, but Treadwell missed the extra point. Moon responded by throwing a 6-yard touchdown to wide receiver Curtis Duncan to give Houston a 21–6 lead, but Denver safety Steve Atwater's interception set up Greg Lewis' 1-yard run touchdown before halftime on an 88-yard drive, making the score 21–13.\nIn the second half, each team scored a field goal, which gave Houston a 24–16 lead in the fourth quarter. The Broncos then marched 80 yards to score on Lewis's 1-yard touchdown run on a drive that included a fumbled snap on 3rd and 8 that Elway recovered to complete a 12-yard first-down pass to Johnson, and a 26-yard completion to Mike Young on fourth down and four. Denver's defense subsequently forced a punt for the first time in the game, and Greg Montgomery's 44-yard kick was downed on the 2-yard line. From there, Elway started off the drive with a 22-yard pass to Young. The Broncos were forced into fourth downs twice in a row after that, but Elway converted each one with a 7-yard run and 44-yard completion to Johnson at the Oilers' 21-yard line. One play later, Treadwell kicked a 28-yard field goal for the win.\nMoon finished the game with 27 of 36 completions for 325 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception. Six of his passes were caught by Ernest Givins for 111 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Oilers and Broncos. Both teams split the previous two meetings.\nSunday, January 5, 1992.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 37, Kansas City Chiefs 14.\nBuffalo avenged their 33–6 Monday night loss to Kansas City during the regular season by eliminating them from the playoffs with a dominating 37–14 win, outgaining them in total yards 448–213. The Bills were aided by the return of defensive end Bruce Smith and Jeff Wright, who had missed almost the entire regular season with injuries, including their prior meeting with the Chiefs. Their offense was bolstered by the return of prior injured receiver Don Beebe, who caught six passes for 78 yards in this game, and James Lofton, who had missed the last two regular season games with an ankle injury.\nThe Bills crushed the Chiefs by jumping to a 24–0 lead in the third quarter. Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly threw for 278 yards and three touchdowns. Bills kicker Scott Norwood, who had missed five of his last six field goal attempts at the end of the regular season, made all three field goal attempts, while Andre Reed finished with four receptions for 100 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Thurman Thomas recorded 100 rushing yards, while Kenneth Davis rushed for 75 yards and a score. The Chiefs had gained 239 rushing yards in the regular season game against Buffalo, with running back Harvey Williams and fullback Christian Okoye rushing for over 100 yards each, but could only gain 77 yards on the ground (with 3.2 yards per carry average) in this playoff rematch, with their leading rusher (Barry Word) gaining just 50.\nAfter each team punted twice, Buffalo took a 7–0 lead by driving 80 yards in 8 plays to score on Kelly's 25-yard touchdown pass to Reed with 52 seconds left in the first quarter. Then after forcing a punt, the Bills drove to the Chiefs' 40-yard line, but lost the ball when a deflected pass went into the arms of Eric Everett. Still, the Bills forced another punt, which Clifford Hicks returned 16 yards to the Bills' 31-yard line. From there, Buffalo drove 69 yards in just four plays, going up 14–0 with Kelly's 53-yard touchdown completion to Reed. Meanwhile, the situation continued to deteriorate for Kansas City, as on their next drive, quarterback Steve DeBerg was knocked out of the game with a thumb injury and replaced by Mark Vlasic. Following another punt, Deron Cherry intercepted a pass from Kelly near the Chiefs' 15-yard line. But a sack from safety Leonard Smith forced Kansas City to punt from inside their own goal line, and gave the Bills good field position on their 45. The Chiefs had a golden opportunity to score a few plays later when Kelly threw an interception to Kevin Ross near the sidelines. Ross had a clear path in front of him to the end zone, but he dropped the pass as he started to run and the ball fell incomplete. Buffalo went on to drive to a 33-yard field goal by Norwood that gave them a 17–0 lead going into halftime.\nOn the second play of the third quarter, Kirby Jackson of the Bills intercepted a pass from Vlasic and returned it 6 yards to the Chiefs' 36-yard line. Buffalo went on to go up 24–0 with a 6-play drive that ended on Kelly's 10-yard touchdown pass to Lofton. A few possessions later, Jackson picked up his second interception. But on the Bills' ensuing drive, Chiefs linebacker Lonnie Marts intercepted a pass from Kelly and returned it 12 yards to the Bills' 44-yard line. Vlasic's following completions to Tim Barnett and Jonathan Hayes for gains of 20 and 21 yards moved the ball to the 3, and Word eventually ran the ball into the end zone to make the score 24–7.\nBut Buffalo took over the game from that point on, driving right back by moving the ball 68 yards in 14 plays, including a 19-yard run by Thomas. Norwood finished the drive with a 20-yard field goal to put his team up 27–7 with 10:54 left in the game. Then Leonard Smith's interception gave Buffalo a first down on the Chiefs' 31-yard line, setting up Norwood's 47-yard field goal to increase the lead to 30–7. Vlasic's next pass was intercepted again, this time by Hicks on the Chiefs' 34-yard line, enabling Buffalo to go up 37–7 on Davis's 5-yard rushing touchdown. Kansas City responded with an 80-yard drive to score on Vlasic's 20-yard touchdown pass to Fred Jones, but by then only 2:07 was left on the clock.\nThis was Thomas's fourth straight postseason game with at least 100 rushing yards, the second longest streak in NFL history (behind John Riggins's 6).\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Bills. Kansas City won the only previous meeting when both teams were part of the AFL.\nNFC: Detroit Lions 38, Dallas Cowboys 6.\nDetroit had defeated Dallas 34–10 in the regular season, and this meeting would be no different. Quarterback Erik Kramer led the Lions to their first postseason victory since 1957 by completing 29 out of 38 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns. Dallas quarterback Steve Beuerlein completed just seven of 13 passes for 91 yards and an interception, before being replaced by Troy Aikman, who was unable to lead the team to any points after stepping on the field. Overall, Detroit outgained the Cowboys in total yards 421–276 and forced four turnovers, without losing any of their own.\nAfter forcing Dallas to punt on their opening drive, Kramer completed passes to Herman Moore, Mike Farr and Willie Green for gains of 11, 13, and 13 yards before he finished the 68-yard drive with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Green. Dallas responded with a pair of receptions by Michael Irvin for 35 yards and an 18-yard run from Emmitt Smith setting up a 28-yard field goal by Ken Willis. But the next time Dallas had the ball, Melvin Jenkins intercepted a pass from Beuerlein and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. After the Cowboys responded with another 28-yard Willis field goal, Eddie Murray's 36-yard field goal made the score 17–6 at halftime. Near the end of the half, Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson benched Beuerlein in favor of Aikman, but this did not improve the Cowboys' fortunes. On the final two plays of the second quarter, Aikman was sacked and then threw an interception to linebacker Chris Spielman.\nEarly in the second half, Kramer finished an 80-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Green. Then linebacker Victor Jones recovered a fumble from Aikman on the Cowboys' 27, leading to Kramer's 7-yard touchdown pass to Moore. In the fourth quarter, Lions running back Barry Sanders, who had been held to just 22 rushing yards up to this point, put the finishing touch on Detroit's victory with an electrifying 47-yard touchdown run.\nGreen finished the day with eight receptions for 115 yards and two touchdowns. Sanders's touchdown would be the only postseason score of his Hall of Fame career.\nThis was the Lions' sole playoff victory between the 1957 NFL Championship Game and a wild-card round victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the 2023-24 NFL playoffs.\nIt was the only one ever to occur at the Pontiac Silverdome, where the Lions played from 1975 to 2001. The Silverdome's demolition in 2018 started a period where only Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, which still stands in a form much reduced from its time as the 49ers' home field, had played host to a Lions postseason victory; this period ended with the Lions' aforementioned 2023-24 wild card win over the Rams.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Lions. Dallas won the only previous meeting.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 12, 1992.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 10, Denver Broncos 7.\nBuffalo relied on missed field goals by Denver and some key plays from their defense to edge the Broncos 10–7, in what was a knock-down, drag-out defensive drama that featured devastating pass rushes that limited both offenses to meager, hard-fought-for yardage throughout the game.\nThe score was 0–0 at the half, even though Denver advanced into Buffalo territory on all five of their first-half possessions. After the first three drives of the game ended in punts, Vance Johnson gave Denver good field position with a 13-yard return to their 49-yard line. The Broncos then drove to the Bills' 34-yard line, but three consecutive plays for negative yardage, including a big sack on third down by Jeff Wright, pushed them all the way back to their own side of the field. After their punt, Denver quickly got another scoring chance when Ron Holmes deflected Bills quarterback Jim Kelly's pass at the line of scrimmage and nose tackle Greg Kragen made a diving interception on the Buffalo 29-yard line. But again Denver ended up with negative yardage and failed to score when David Treadwell was wide right on a 47-yard field goal attempt. Buffalo then drove to Denver territory for the first time in the game, but were stopped there and had to punt.\nThe Broncos then went on a rough back-and-forth drive featuring numerous penalties (including an encroachment call against the Bills on fourth down and 4), negative plays, an Elway fumble that he recovered himself, and an interception overturned by replay review. Despite all this, Denver managed to reach the Bills' 16-yard line, but then Elway's fumble and recovery lost the team five yards and a third-down sack by Bruce Smith pushed them back another 8. On the next play, Treadwell missed a 42-yard field goal attempt, this time hitting the right upright. Johnson returned Buffalo's next punt 10 yards to midfield. Then on Denver's first play, Steve Sewell gained 26 yards on a screen pass. But after two tackles near the line of scrimmage by Cornelius Bennett, Elway was stopped on a quarterback draw and Treadwell missed again, this time hitting the right upright from 37 yards out. Meanwhile, Buffalo finished the half with just three first downs, one week after racking up 29 in their win over Kansas City.\nEarly in the third quarter, Denver quarterback John Elway (who was sacked three times) suffered a deep thigh bruise that limited his mobility. Meanwhile, Buffalo finally managed to mount a sustained drive. Aided by a 16-yard run from Andre Reed on a reverse play, they drove all the way to the Broncos' 27-yard line. But continuing the trend of the day, they failed to capitalize when defensive back Tyrone Braxton intercepted Kelly's third down pass.\nOn the Broncos' ensuing possession, they faced second down and 10 at their own 19-yard line. Elway attempted a middle screen pass to Sewell (which had been Denver's most effective play), but it was tipped by Wright into the arms of linebacker Carlton Bailey. Bailey broke an Elway tackle and returned the ball 11 yards for what would be Buffalo's only touchdown of the game.\nElway's injury worsened to the point of his being replaced by backup Gary Kubiak in the fourth quarter. Kubiak managed to lead the Broncos into Bills territory, but they turned the ball over on downs when Cliff Hicks tackled Mike Young on the Buffalo 23-yard line one yard short of a first down on fourth and 11. After being completely dominated up to this point, Buffalo's offense got on track with a pivotal 25-yard third-down completion by Kelly to tight end Keith McKeller. A few runs by hobbled Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas and a 10-yard catch by Reed carried the Bills to within field goal range, and with 4:18 left in the game, Buffalo kicker Scott Norwood made a 44-yard field goal to increase the lead to 10–0.\nKubiak, who was playing in his last NFL game before retiring, started out the Broncos next drive with an 11-yard scramble and then a completion to Johnson at midfield. Another completion to Johnson moved the ball to the 43, and then Mark Jackson caught a pass for a first down at the Bills' 39. Following an encroachment penalty and an incompletion, Johnson made a spinning mid-air catch on the Bills' 10-yard line. Then after Johnson hauled in his fourth reception of the drive, Kubiak finished the 8-play. 85-yard drive with a 3-yard touchdown run on a quarterback draw, cutting the deficit to 10–7 with less than two minutes left. Steve Atwater then recovered the ensuing onside kick on the Broncos' 49-yard line, but on the next play Kirby Jackson forced and recovered a fumble from Sewell with 1:28 left. Denver forced Buffalo to punt, but there were only 17 seconds left when they started their drive from their own 20-yard line. Kubiak completed two passes to move his team near midfield. However, the second play ended in bounds and the clock ran out.\nDenver finished the game leading in almost every statistical category, except for rushing. Johnson, who had only 208 receiving yards during the season, finished with seven receptions for 100 yards and three punt returns for 36 yards. Kubiak completed 11 of 12 passes for 136 yards and rushed for 22 yards, outscoring and out-passing Kelly and Elway. The Broncos defense held the high-powered Bills offense to 13 catches (most of them completed to tight ends and running backs) and three offensive points.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Broncos and Bills.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 41, Detroit Lions 10.\nIn their season opening game, Washington beat the Lions 45–0. The Lions now had future Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders, who had missed their first meeting in Week 1 with an injury, but it didn't help.\nThe Redskins crushed the Lions, 41–10, as quarterback Mark Rypien completed 12 out of 17 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns. Detroit quarterback Erik Kramer was sacked five times, three of them by Washington linebacker Wilber Marshall. Sanders, who rushed for 1,548 yards during the season, was held to just 44 yards on 11 carries.\nThe Redskins forced two turnovers on the Lions' first two possessions, and jumped to a 10–0 lead just 4:02 into the game. On Detroit's first play of the game, Washington defensive end Charles Mann forced Kramer to fumble and Fred Stokes recovered the ball on the Lions' 10, setting up running back Gerald Riggs' 2-yard touchdown. Then Redskins kicker Chip Lohmiller made a 20-yard field goal after linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a pass and returned it 38 yards to the Detroit 10-yard line. In the second quarter, Kramer led the Lions 75 yards in 11 plays to score on his 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Willie Green, but it was countered by Washington's 73-yard drive leading to a 3-yard touchdown run by Riggs. Detroit then drove 76 yards to score on Eddie Murray's 30-yard field goal and the Redskins only led 17–10 at halftime.\nHowever, Washington scored 24 unanswered points in the second half, starting with Lohmiller's 28-yard field goal that was set up by Rypien's 45-yard completion to tight end Terry Orr, making the score 20–10. On Detroit's second drive of the third quarter, they moved the ball 45 yards to the Redskins' 21-yard line, but on third and 5, linebacker Andre Collins sacked Kramer for a 5-yard loss. Then Murray's 44-yard field goal attempt was blocked by Jumpy Geathers. Rypien completed a 31-yard pass to Art Monk on the Redskins' ensuing drive, and followed it up with a 45-yard touchdown pass to Gary Clark that gave the Redskins a 27–10 lead. He added a 21-yard touchdown pass to Monk in the fourth quarter, while Darrell Green finished off the scoring by returning an interception 32 yards for a score.\nAfter the game, the Redskins dedicated their win to WUSA sports anchor Glenn Brenner, who died from a brain tumor two days after the game.\nTo date, this is the last time Washington advanced as far the Conference Championship game.\nThis would be the Lions most recent NFC Championship game appearance until the 2023 season.\nThis was the final postseason game at RFK Stadium. The Redskins went 11–1 at the facility in the playoffs, losing only a to the Bears.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Lions and Redskins. Washington won the only previous meeting.\nThis loss began a nine-game postseason skid for the Lions which ended in the 2023 season. The last eight were in the wild card round, including a 27-13 setback to the Redskins at FedEx Field in . In 2023, they ended the streak in a win against the Los Angeles Rams in the wildcard round.\nSuper Bowl XXVI: Washington Redskins 37, Buffalo Bills 24.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Redskins and Bills."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1990 season began on January 5, 1991. The postseason tournament concluded with the New York Giants defeating the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV, 20–19, on January 27, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\nThe league expanded its playoff system from a 10-team to a 12-team tournament, which remained in use through the 2019–20 NFL playoffs. With these changes, three wild-card teams (those non-division champions with the conference's best won-lost-tied percentages) qualified from each conference, up from two the year before.\nThe format consisted of the following:\nThe 3 seed hosted the 6 seed in one game while the 4 hosted the 5 seed in another game, both making up what was dubbed the \"wild-card round\". The 1 and 2 seeds from each conference receive a first-round bye, earning an automatic berth in the following week's \"divisional playoff\" games, where they faced the wild card survivors. The reseeding system was implemented in which the 1-seeded team played against the lowest-ranked wild card winner while the 2-seeded played against the other wild card winner. Whoever had the higher seed got the home-field advantage in a given game. In addition, a rule stating that teams from the same division cannot play against each other in the divisional round was abolished.\nIn each conference, the matchup between the 3 and 6 seeds in the wild-card round dictated where the wild-card round winners traveled to for the divisional round:\nThese changes meant that the lowest-seeded division winner in each conference no longer received automatic bye weeks, which had been done since the expansion of the playoffs to ten teams for the 1978 season. However, this did guarantee that the worst division winner would host a home playoff game for the first time. Before this change, the only way the #3 seed got the right to host a playoff game only if they were the highest remaining seed after the Divisional Playoffs, earning them the right to host their conference’s respective championship game.\nThis system was later modified before the 2002–03 NFL playoffs after the league realigned the teams into eight divisions (four per conference). The number of teams in the playoffs remained the same, but now there were four division champions and two wild-card teams from each conference. This system was kept until 2020.\nAs of the 2022–23 playoffs, this is the last postseason in which all division winners won a playoff game.\nSchedule.\nWith the expansion from a 10-team to a 12-team playoff system, \"wild card Sunday\" became \"wild card Weekend\", with two games played on Saturday and two on Sunday, similar to the Divisional playoffs. From Super Bowl XXV onward, all Super Bowls have since been scheduled for 6 p.m. EST or later, regardless of the local time zone, so the game runs into the primetime hours.\nABC was awarded the rights to broadcast the two Saturday wild-card playoff games. CBS then televised the rest of the NFC games and NBC broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games. ABC also televised Super Bowl XXV.\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 5, 1991.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 20, Philadelphia Eagles 6.\nThe Redskins overcame losing two turnovers and a 6–0 deficit to score 20 unanswered points. This game was sweet revenge for the Redskins, who had lost to the Eagles 28–14 in a Monday night game during the season in which the Eagles defense had scored two touchdowns and knocked nine Washington players out of the game, including all of their quarterbacks. The game has become known as the \"Body Bag Game\" because the Eagles defense had taunted the Redskins by asking if they had enough body bags for their team.\nPhiladelphia started the game strong as quarterback Randall Cunningham completed a 66-yard pass to tight end Keith Jackson on their third play from scrimmage, giving the team a first down at the Redskins 11-yard line. However, the next three plays resulted in a 1-yard run, an incomplete pass, and a 10-yard sack by Washington linebacker Monte Coleman, forcing the Eagles to settle for a 37-yard field goal by Roger Ruzek. After a pair of punts by each team, the Redskins got the ball on their 21 yard line with 14:23 remaining in the second quarter. Running back Gerald Riggs lost the ball due to a tackle by Seth Joyner, and safety Wes Hopkins recovered it on the Redskins 25. A few plays later, a defensive holding penalty against the Redskins gave Philadelphia a first down on the 2-yard line, but they still could not get into the end zone. First, Washington defender Markus Koch tackled Heath Sherman for a 1-yard loss. Cunningham tried to pass the ball on the next two plays, but his first attempt was incomplete, and on his second try, he was sacked for an 8-yard loss by defensive tackle Charles Mann. Ruzek then kicked a 28-yard field goal to give Philadelphia a 6–0 lead just under five minutes into the second quarter.\nEagles cornerback Eric Allen ended Washington's possession by intercepting a pass from Mark Rypien on their 46. But in what turned out to be a critical defensive stand, the Eagles could not move the ball and had to punt. From this point on, Washington took over the game. Faced with third and 9 on his own 33-yard line, Rypien completed a 28-yard pass to receiver Art Monk, and followed it up with a 23-yard completion to running back Earnest Byner. On the next play, his 16-yard touchdown pass to Monk gave the Redskins a 7–6 lead with 5:54 left in the half. Alvin Walton recovered a fumble from Sherman to end the Eagles next drive. Philadelphia's defense forced a punt, but their next drive fared no better as Cunningham was intercepted by Darrell Green at midfield. A few plays later, Byner lost a fumble that turned into a 94-yard touchdown return by cornerback Ben Smith. It seemed to be a repeat of Byner's infamous play known as \"The Fumble\" in the , but this time it was overturned by instant replay (George Sladky), as replays showed Byner was down by contact before the ball came out. Washington kept possession and ended up increasing their lead to 10–6 on a 20-yard Chip Lohmiller field goal.\nWashington increased their lead to 13–6 late in the third quarter with a 19-yard field goal by Lohmiller. At this point, Cunningham was benched and replaced by Jim McMahon, who promptly threw three straight incompletions before Brian Mitchell returned their punt to the Redskins 45-yard line. Rypien subsequently completed a 47-yard pass to Gary Clark on third and 5, and then hit him with a 3-yard touchdown pass two plays later, increasing Washington's lead to 20–6. Cunningham would return to the starting lineup on the next series, but could not lead the Eagles to any more points.\nRypien finished his first playoff game completing 15 of 31 passes for 206 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Cunningham completed 15 of 29 passes for 205 yards with one interception. He was also the game's leading rusher with 80 yards, but was sacked five times. Jackson was the top receiver of the game with five receptions for 116 yards.\nThis was the last game for Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan as he was fired shortly after this game. He failed to reach the playoffs in his next head-coaching job with the Arizona Cardinals and was fired after two seasons, thus failing to win a playoff game as a head coach.\nThis was the first (and, as of 2023, only) postseason meeting between the Redskins and Eagles.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 17, Kansas City Chiefs 16.\nWith 3:28 left in the game, the Dolphins capped an 85-yard drive with quarterback Dan Marino's winning 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Clayton.\nOn the Dolphins opening drive they reached midfield, but Marino was sacked on third down and Reggie Roby's punt was blocked by Charles Washington, giving the Chiefs the ball at the Miami 37-yard line. After nine plays and a 28-yard gain, the Chiefs scored on a 27-yard field goal from Nick Lowery. Miami responded with a 40-yard drive, with Marino completing a 12-yard pass to Mark Duper on third down and four yards needed to keep it moving. The drive ended on the Chiefs 40-yard line, where Pete Stoyanovich made an NFL playoff record 58-yard field goal to tie the game.\nThe Chiefs responded with a drive to the Dolphins 30-yard line, featuring a 33-yard reception by receiver Stephone Paige, but it ended with no points when safety Jarvis Williams intercepted a pass from Steve DeBerg. After an exchange of punts, Miami drove to the Chiefs 39-yard line. Stoyanovich attempted another long field goal, this one 57 yards, but this time he missed and the Chiefs got rolling with a 16-yard run from Christian Okoye. Then DeBerg got his team into the end zone with two completions to Paige, the first for 16 yards and the second a 26-yard touchdown to make the score 10–3. Miami later threatened to score with a drive in the Chiefs territory, but Neil Smith forced a fumble from Marino and J. C. Pearson recovered it, keeping the score 10–3 at halftime.\nThe Chiefs had to punt on their first drive, and Bryan Barker's 44-yard kick pinned the Dolphins back at their own 6-yard line. Miami was forced to a three and out, but Roby's 64-yard punt sent the Chiefs all the way back to their own 30. DeBerg started off the possession with a 26-yard completion to Emile Harry. Following a sack and an incompletion, the Chiefs faced third and 15. On the next play, running back Todd McNair picked up 13 yards on a screen pass, and on fourth down and 2 from the Dolphins 36, Okoye rushed five yards for a first down. Two more DeBerg completions advanced the ball to the 1-yard line, but an intentional grounding penalty moved the ball back 10 yards and the Chiefs ended up settling for a 25-yard field goal from Lowery. Then on the first play of the Dolphins next drive, Duper lost a fumble while being tackled by Deron Cherry, and Dino Hackett recovered for the Chiefs on the Miami 29-yard line. Three runs by Okoye gained eight yards, and then Lowery kicked his third field goal to give his team a 16–3 lead.\nMiami fought back with a 66-yard, 10-play touchdown drive. On the last play of the third quarter, Sammie Smith converted a fourth down with a 2-yard run. Then Marino connected with Mark Clayton for a 23-yard gain, setting up his 1-yard touchdown pass to Tony Paige that cut the deficit to six points with 12 minutes left. DeBerg responded with a 33-yard completion to Harry on the first play of the Chiefs ensuing drive, but it stalled on the Dolphins 41-yard line and Barker had to punt it away, giving the Dolphins the ball at their own 15 where Marino led his team 85 yards for the game winning score, starting with a 37-yard completion to tight end Ferrell Edmunds. After 10 plays and three third down conversions, Marino finished the drive with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Clayton, giving Miami a 17–16 lead with 3:28 left in the game.\nThe Chiefs took the ball back and fought hard for a winning field goal, driving into Dolphins territory where Okoye's 26-yard burst moved the ball to the 26-yard line. But on the next play, a holding call wiped out his 12-yard run and pushed the team back 10 yards. As the final seconds of the game approached, the Chiefs could only make it back to the 34. Lowery, who had made his last 22 field goals, attempted a game winner from 52 yards out, but it fell just short.\nMarino finished the game with 19 of 30 completions for 221 yards and two touchdowns. Stephone Paige caught eight passes for 142 yards and a score.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Dolphins. Miami won the only previous meeting.\nSunday, January 6, 1991.\nAFC: Cincinnati Bengals 41, Houston Oilers 14.\nRiverfront Stadium continued to be a house of horrors for the Oilers, who had lost in 9 of their last 10 trips to the Queen City and had given up 44, 61 (a Bengals team record) and 40 points in their last 3 visits. Not only had they lost their previous meeting with the Bengals, a 40–20 defeat in week 16, but they also lost starting quarterback Warren Moon, who suffered a dislocated thumb in the game.\nDespite losing starting running back James Brooks to injury in the first quarter (ironically the same injury that sidelined Moon, a dislocated thumb), the Bengals crushed the Oilers by jumping to a 34–0 lead in the third quarter and holding the ball for 39:45. On the opening drive, they advanced 70 yards in 11 plays, including a 46-yard completion from Boomer Esiason to tight end Rodney Holman, to score on a 1-yard run by fullback Ickey Woods. Then after forcing a punt, Esiason completed passes to Tim McGee and Harold Green for gains of 19 and 13 yards, while Brooks rushed for a 14-yard gain as the team drove to a 10–0 lead on Jim Breech's 27-yard field goal with just over 1 minute left in the first quarter.\nEarly in the second quarter, Bengals safety David Fulcher intercepted a pass from Cody Carlson and returned it 43 yards to the Oilers' 16-yard line, setting up Esiason's 2-yard touchdown toss to Green. The next time Cincinnati got the ball, they drove 75 yards to another Breech field goal to give the team a 20–0 lead going into halftime. Houston finished the first half with one first down and 36 yards, while Cincinnati gained 15 first downs, 222 yards, and 20 points.\nHouston had to punt on the first drive of the second half, and Mitchell Price returned Greg Montgomery's 47-yard kick 34 yards to the Oilers' 34-yard line. The Bengals then drove to another score, with Esiason rushing for 27 yards on a scramble before running back Eric Ball finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run. Less than a minute later, Carlson fumbled a snap, which linebacker James Francis recovered for Cincinnati on the Oilers 10-yard line. Esiason ran the ball into the end zone on the next play, giving the Bengals a 34–0 lead after just 3:51 had elapsed in the third quarter. This time, Houston was able to respond, driving 80 yards to score on Carlson's 16-yard touchdown pass to Ernest Givins, making the score 34–7. With 14 minutes left in the final quarter, Cincinnati scored another touchdown on Esiason's 9-yard pass to tight end Eric Kattus, while Givins caught another touchdown pass from Carlson to make the final score 41–14.\nEsiason finished the game with 14 of 20 completions for 150 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 57 yards and a score. Cincinnati's most lopsided playoff win in franchise history was the result of a team effort. The Bengals racked up 187 yards on the ground even though no player rushed for more than 57 yards, and added another 162 yards through the air, though no one caught more than two passes. Overall, the Bengals gained 349 yards while holding Houston to 227, with just 69 rushing yards. Ironically, Houston had helped get Cincinnati into the playoffs by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in their final game of the season, causing the Bengals to win the AFC Central based on tiebreaker rules.\nThis win was the last one in Sam Wyche's career and the last playoff win for the Bengals until the 2021 season. The next season, the Bengals fell to 3–13 and began a streak of fourteen consecutive non-winning seasons.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Oilers and Bengals.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 16, New Orleans Saints 6.\nThe Bears defense held the Saints to 193 total yards, 65 rushing yards, six first downs, and two field goals. Chicago also recorded 365 yards of total offense. Bears running back Neal Anderson compiled 102 rushing yards, 42 receiving yards, and threw a 22-yard halfback option pass.\nThe score was 10–3 at the end of the first half, due to a Kevin Butler field goal and Mike Tomczak's 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end James Thornton. The Saints' only score of the half was a 47-yard field goal by Morten Andersen, who would later miss from 41 yards and have another attempt blocked. Also, with three minutes left before halftime, New Orleans starting quarterback Steve Walsh, who had completed just six of 16 passes, was knocked out of the game and replaced by John Fourcade. Fourcade fared no better, completing just five of 18 passes for 79 yards, including two interceptions.\nStill the Saints were just trailing 10–3 near the end of the third quarter, and had a great chance to tie the game when defensive tackle Renaldo Turnbull blocked Butler's 45-yard field goal attempt. New Orleans defensive end Vince Buck recovered the ball and returned it 62 yards for a potential touchdown, only to see the play wiped out by an offsides penalty on teammate Robert Massey, who had lined up with his hand over the neutral zone. The penalty not only eliminated the score, but it also gave Chicago a first down, and seven plays later, Butler kicked a 25-yard field goal to put them up 13–3.\nWith 5:52 left in the fourth quarter, Andersen's 38-yard field goal brought the scoring difference back to just a touchdown at 13–6. However, when faced with third and 11 on the Bears ensuing drive, Tomczak completed a 38-yard pass to Dennis Gentry, enabling Chicago to maintain possession and drive to Butler's game-clinching 21-yard field goal with 3:47 remaining on the clock.\n\"You just try to line up as close as you can; I didn't realize I was offside\", said Massey about his critical penalty after the game. \"But when I saw the flag, I said, 'Oh, God!' I knew it was me.\"\nIt was Mike Ditka's last playoff win as Bears head coach.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Saints and Bears.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 12, 1991.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 44, Miami Dolphins 34.\nIn a shootout, the Bills jumped to a 20–3 lead in the first half, and kept pace with the Dolphins as the two teams matched each other score for score for the rest of the game. By the end, both teams finished even in first downs (24) and nearly even in total yards (493 for Buffalo, 430 for Miami). Ultimately, Miami's three turnovers to the Bills' two would make the key difference.\nThe Bills took the opening kickoff and scored with a typical fast-paced drive, moving the ball 76 yards in five plays. Running back Thurman Thomas rushed for 14 yards and caught a pass for 20, while Jim Kelly finished it off with a 40-yard touchdown pass to receiver Andre Reed. Aided by three Bills penalties, the Dolphins responded with a 40-yard drive that ended on Pete Stoyanovich's 49-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 7–3. The Bills struck back with Kelly's 44-yard completion to James Lofton setting up a 24-yard Scott Norwood field goal, retaking their 7-point lead at 10–3. On the next series, Miami quarterback Dan Marino threw a pass that was tipped by Darryl Talley and intercepted by Nate Odomes, who returned the ball nine yards to the Dolphins 38. Faced with third and 8 on their ensuing possession, Kelly took off for a 16-yard gain. He fumbled at the end, but center Kent Hull recovered the ball for a first down on the 18-yard line. Norwood completed the drive with his second field goal, this one from 22 yards, upping the lead to 13–3.\nThe Dolphins had to punt early in the second quarter at the end of their next drive, once again forcing their defense to deal with the terror of Kelly, Thomas, and Reed. This time the three players would combine for 67 yards as Thomas rushed twice for eight and caught an 11-yard pass before Kelly's 43-yard completion to Reed brought up first and goal on the Miami 5-yard line. Thomas ran it across the goal line from there, giving the Bills a 20–3 lead. But on this occasion the Dolphins were ready to respond as Marino completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Duper on third and 5, and then hooked up with him again for a 64-yard touchdown completion that cut the score to 20–10. Not to be outdone, Kelly led the Bills back on a 68-yard scoring drive, starting with a 19-yard pass to Lofton on the first play and a 9-yard run on the next. Later in the drive, he kept it going with a 13-yard pass to Reed on fourth and 3 from the Dolphins 32, and eventually finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown toss to Lofton. With Norwood's extra point, the Bills were up by 17 at 27–10 with five minutes left in the half.\nThe game seemed to be slipping away from Miami, particularly as they were forced to punt on their next possession and receiver Al Edwards returned the ball 17 yards. However, Edwards lost a fumble on the runback, which punter Reggie Roby recovered on the Bills 47. The Dolphins then made another big play when Marino completed a 38-yard pass to Duper on fourth down and 5 from the 42, and with just 27 seconds left on the clock, Marino scored on a 2-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 27–17 at halftime.\nMiami continued to whittle away the Bills lead in the third quarter with an 8-play, 62-yard scoring drive, featuring a 17-yard run by Sammie Smith on third and 2. Stoyanovich finished the drive with a 22-yard field goal that cut their deficit down to one score, 27–20. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Dolphins 27, but this time their defense was up to the task and Kelly was intercepted by safety Jarvis Williams on the 2. However, Miami could not pick up a first down pinned deep in their own territory. Marino tried to go deep on third down, but Bills safety Mark Kelso picked him off at the Dolphins 48, leading to a 28-yard Norwood field goal that gave the Bills a 30–20 lead.\nDolphins running back Marc Logan returned the ensuing kickoff 30 yards to the Dolphins 43, and Marino completed a 23-yard pass to Mark Clayton on the next play. Then Smith ran twice for 18, bringing up first down on the Bills 13-yard line. Miami was on a roll and didn't stop until Marino completed the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to guard Roy Foster, who had checked in as an eligible receiver. His touchdown brought Miami back within three points less than two minutes into the fourth quarter. However, their comeback hopes were swiftly snuffed out by the Bills offense, who stormed back 63 yards in 10 plays, including Kelly's 5-yard completion to tight end Keith McKeller on fourth and 2, and retook a 10-point lead with Thomas' 5-yard touchdown run. Then linebacker Hal Garner forced a fumble from Logan on the ensuing kickoff, which Norwood recovered for Buffalo on the Dolphins 29. Two plays later, Kelly essentially put the game away with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Reed, giving the Bills a 44–27 lead with 9:42 left in regulation. Miami still tried to fight back, driving to the Bills 35, but lost the ball as Marino threw four straight incompletions. Following a Bills punt, Miami drove 91 yards in 15 plays to score on Marino's 8-yard pass to receiver Tony Martin, but by then only 1:15 was left on the clock. The Bills recovered Miami's onside kick attempt and went on to win, 44–34.\nKelly, who returned to start for the Bills after missing the last two games of the season with a knee injury, passed for 339 yards and three touchdowns, while also rushing for 37 yards. Reed was also a big factor, recording 123 receiving yards and a pair of touchdown catches. Lofton caught seven passes for 149 yards and a touchdown. Thomas led the Bills ground attack with 32 carries for 117 rushing yards and two touchdowns, while also catching three passes for 38 yards. Marino threw for 323 yards and three touchdowns, but was intercepted twice. Duper caught three passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. Running back Sammie Smith rushed for 99 yards and caught a 9-yard reception.\n\"It was lick-your-chops time\", exclaimed Reed after the game. \"I'll tell you, a lot of times he (Louis Oliver, who had five interceptions during the season) played off the line. And if the field would have been dry, I would have had 300 yards in catches.\"\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Dolphins and Bills.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Washington Redskins 10.\nAlthough Washington outgained the 49ers in total yards 441 to 338, they were unable to overcome quarterback Mark Rypien's three interceptions, several controversial ref calls that went against them, as well as the performance of Joe Montana, who passed for 200 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.\nThe Redskins opened up the scoring with an 8-play, 78-yard drive that culminated in Rypien's 31-yard touchdown completion to receiver Art Monk. San Francisco struck back by driving 74 yards in eight plays to tie the game on a 1-yard touchdown run by fullback Tom Rathman. A key play of the drive was an unnecessary roughness call against Redskins cornerback Darrell Green for throwing Jerry Rice to the ground during a tackle, turning Rice's reception into a 25-yard gain. Green was stunned by the penalty, stating he didn't realize the call was against him until he made his way to the sidelines. Near the end of the quarter, Redskins kicker Chip Lohmiller made a 44-yard field goal that put Washington back in front at 10–7.\nMontana quickly rallied the 49ers back in the second quarter, leading them on an 80-yard scoring drive that saw San Francisco fool Washington with a halfback option play in which running back Harry Sydney completed a 28-yard pass to tight end Brent Jones. On the last play of the drive, Montana fired a 10-yard pass to Rice in the end zone, who caught the ball between two defenders to retake the lead for San Francisco at 14–10. The team was aided by another controversial call on the drive; Jones caught his 47-yard reception in the air and landed with a foot out of bounds, but officials ruled he had been forced out in the air by safety Alvin Walton. At the time, a reception made by a player forced out of bounds still counted as a catch. This rule was changed in 2008. Then after a punt, Montana again went to work, completing a 32-yard pass to halfback Roger Craig and a 47-yarder to Jones before finishing off the 89-yard possession with an 8-yard scoring toss to Mike Sherrard.\nSherrard's touchdown made the score 21–10 going into halftime, and it turned out to be the final score of the day for the offenses of both teams. Washington advanced inside the 49ers' 15-yard line three times in the second half, but failed to score on all of them. On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers' 7-yard line before Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance to get back in the game, intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Eric Davis seemed to make contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295-pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who rumbled 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28–10.\n\"I just couldn't believe there was no flag,\" Clark said after the game, in reference to Davis' contact with him. \"I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had.\" \"I'm not going to walk out of here crying,\" Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. \"We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand.\" Rypien added \"I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28–10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to.\"\nRypien finished the game 27/48 for 361 yards and a touchdown, but was intercepted three times. Monk had 10 receptions for 163 yards and a score. Montana finished the day 22/31 for 274 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His top receiver was Jones, who caught four passes for 103 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Redskins and 49ers. The teams split the previous two meetings.\nSunday, January 13, 1991.\nNFC: New York Giants 31, Chicago Bears 3.\nThe Giants defense dominated the game by allowing only 27 rushing yards and three points. This was the fewest rushing yards Chicago had gained in a game since 1967. Their previous low for the season was 100. Bears running back Neal Anderson, who had rushed for over 1,000 yards in the season and 102 yards in the previous playoff game, was held to 19 yards on 12 carries. Giants quarterback Jeff Hostetler, playing because starter Phil Simms suffered a season-ending injury, completed 10 out of 17 passes for 122 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 43 yards and another score.\nOn Chicago's second possession of the game, Mark Collins of the Giants intercepted Mike Tomczak's pass after it bounced out of the hands of Dennis Gentry and returned it 11 yards to set up a 46-yard field goal by Matt Bahr. The Bears took the ensuing kickoff and drove to the Giants 27, but on fourth and 12, coach Mike Ditka decided against attempting a field goal in the 13 mph winds. On Chicago's conversion attempt, Anderson caught a pass from Tomczak, but was stuffed after a short gain. The Giants then drove 75 yards, including a 6-yard fourth down conversion catch by reserve tight end Bob Mrosko, to go up 10–0 on Hostetler's 21-yard completion to Stephen Baker.\nIn the second quarter, Hostetler lost a fumble while being sacked by Steve McMichael, and Bears defensive tackle Dan Hampton recovered the ball. Chicago then drove to the Giants 1-yard line. But on a fourth down conversion attempt, Giants defensive end John Washington plowed through Jim Covert's block attempt and tackled fullback Brad Muster for a loss. Still, the Bears managed to force a three-and-out, and convert good starting field position into a 33-yard field goal by Kevin Butler. But before the end of the half, the Giants went up 17–3 with an 80-yard, 11-play scoring drive. On the first play, Hostetler scrambled away from a Bears blitz and rushed for 11 yards. Later on, he converted a fourth and 1 at the Bears 32 with a 10-yard burst, and eventually he finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Howard Cross.\nIn the third quarter, Hostetler converted his third fourth down of the day with a 9-yard scramble on fourth and 6, and eventually finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, putting his team up 24–3. Chicago responded with a drive to the Giants 5-yard line. On fourth and goal, Muster caught a pass at the 1, but was dropped by linebackers Pepper Johnson and Gary Reasons before he could get across the goal line. In the fourth quarter, Everson Walls returned an interception 37 yards to the Giants 49. The Giants then went on a grueling 51-yard drive consisting of 16 running plays, the last a 1-yard touchdown plunge by fullback Maurice Carthon, that ate up a staggering 10:30 of play time.\nThis game offered a preview of what lay in store for Super Bowl XXV, as the Giants scored on drives of 75, 80, 49 and 51 yards, which lasted nine, 11, 11 and 16 plays. Overall, the Giants held the ball for 38:22, compared to Chicago's 21:38. The only negative thing for New York was the loss of running back Rodney Hampton, who suffered a broken leg in the first half.\nThis was the eighth postseason meeting between the Bears and Giants. Chicago had won five of the previous seven meetings.\nAFC: Los Angeles Raiders 20, Cincinnati Bengals 10.\nThe Raiders, who had defeated Cincinnati 24–7 during the regular season, recorded 235 rushing yards (with 140 of them coming from running back Marcus Allen), while holding the Bengals to just 182 total yards and sacking Boomer Esiason four times (three by lineman Greg Townsend), but still had to score 10 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory.\nThe Bengals came into this game crippled by injuries. Starting running back James Brooks, still recovering from a dislocated thumb he received in the previous week, was held to just 26 rushing yards on 11 carries, while starting offensive tackle Anthony Muñoz and guard Bruce Reimers both had to miss the game. The injury to Munoz, a future Hall of Famer, was particularly devastating, as the team was forced to assign Kirk Scrafford, a rookie in his first NFL start, to block Townsend, who had led the Raiders with 12.5 sacks during the season.\nAfter forcing the Bengals to punt on the opening drive, Tim Brown gave his team good field position with a 17-yard return to the Raiders 45. Los Angeles then drove to the Bengals 24-yard line, only to turn the ball over when Solomon Wilcots batted down Jay Schroeder's pass on fourth down and 1. Los Angeles later advanced to midfield where Jeff Gossett's punt pinned the Bengals back at their own 5-yard line. But Cincinnati still managed to drive 87 yards in nine plays. Quarterback Boomer Esiason completed a 22-yard pass to Brooks and a 40-yard throw to tight end Rodney Holman, while Ickey Woods' 11-yard run gave the Bengals a first down on the Raiders 19-yard line. However, the Raiders defense managed to keep Cincinnati out of the end zone, forcing them to settle for Jim Breech's 27-yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead with 12:07 left in the second quarter. Los Angeles quickly countered with Bo Jackson rushing three times for 36 yards and Marcus Allen rushing once for 19 on the way to a 13-yard touchdown pass from Schroeder to Mervyn Fernandez.\nOn the third play of the second half, Jackson broke off a 34-yard run, but was knocked out of the game on the play, and the team failed to score when Bengals safety David Fulcher intercepted a pass that bounced out of Allen's hands and returned it 11 yards to the Cincinnati 19-yard line. After forcing a punt, the Raiders drove 45 yards in eight plays and scored on a 49-yard Jeff Jaeger field goal to increase their lead to 10–3. Cincinnati responded with a 13-play (11 runs), 71-yard drive to score on Esiason's 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Stanford Jennings, tying the game with just under 12 minutes left in the game. But the Raiders took over the game from that point with consecutive scoring drives. The Bengals defense seemed ready to force a punt when linebacker Carl Zander sacked Schroeder for a 10-yard loss, bringing up third down and 20 from the Raiders 22-yard line. But on the next play, Schroeder completed a 26-yard pass to Brown for a first down. Following two running plays, Schroeder threw a 41-yard touchdown bomb to tight end Ethan Horton that put the Raiders up 17–10 at the end of a 7-play, 80-yard drive. On the third play of the Bengals ensuing drive, Townsend sacked Esiason for a 15-yard loss that forced the Bengals to punt. Taking over on their own 30-yard line, Los Angeles put the game away with a 62-yard drive, featuring runs by Allen for gains of 20 and 18 yards, that ate up 5:13 and ended on Jaeger's 25-yard field goal with 19 seconds left in the game.\nThis was Bo Jackson's final NFL game, having injured his left hip during the third quarter while being tackled from behind by Bengals linebacker Kevin Walker. The injury was later revealed to have caused a degenerative bone condition in Jackson's hip called avascular necrosis. Before being knocked out of the game, he rushed six times for 77 yards. Some Bengals fans theorize that this injury to one of the greatest athletes ever placed a curse on the Bengals franchise (sometimes called \"the curse of Bo Jackson\"), and that this curse is partially responsible for the Bengals' notorious failure to field a competitive football team for most of the next decade and a half.\nThis game is also notable for being Allen's last 100-plus yard rushing performance with the Raiders, as well as the last postseason game the Bengals would play in until 2005. The Bengals did not win another playoff game until 2022, when they ended the curse by beating the Raiders. Their winless playoff streak was the longest among all 32 NFL teams. Both quarterbacks combined for just 19 completions (8 by Esiason, 11 by Schroeder).\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Bengals and Raiders. The Raiders won the only previous meeting while in Oakland.\nConference championships.\nSunday, January 20, 1991.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 51, Los Angeles Raiders 3.\nRaiders head coach Art Shell became the first African-American coach to take his team to a conference championship game, but the results were not in his favor. Two years after a devastating loss in Cincinnati, the Bills returned to the AFC title game and, this time, shredded the Raiders, 51–3.\nOn Buffalo's opening drive, Kelly completed six consecutive passes for 65 yards, the last a 13-yard touchdown toss to Lofton after he recovered a fumbled snap in shotgun formation. The Raiders responded with Schroeder's two 26-yard completions to Willie Gault and Mervyn Fernandez, setting up a 41-yard field goal from Jeff Jaeger, but Buffalo stormed back to score just four plays after the ensuing kickoff on a 66-yard drive. Following a 41-yard completion from Kelly to Lofton, and an 11-yard scramble by Kelly, Thomas's 12-yard touchdown run gave the Bills a 14–3 lead. After a punt, Garry Lewis intercepted a pass from Kelly that went through Thomas's hands. But three plays later, Talley intercepted a pass from Schroeder and returned it for a touchdown. The Raiders were forced to punt on their next possession, and Nate Odomes returned it 18 yards to the Bills 42-yard line. Buffalo then drove 58 yards in 12 plays, scoring with a 1-yard touchdown run by Davis on fourth and goal, which gave the team a 27–3 lead after LA's Scott Davis blocked the extra point.\nThe Bills had a chance to score again when Jamie Mueller recovered a fumble from Jamie Holland on the ensuing kickoff. But this time LA's defense stopped Buffalo on three straight plays and Scott Norwood missed a 45-yard field goal attempt. Still, Buffalo's dominance would resume after this. Following a Raiders punt, Kelly's completions to Thomas and Steve Tasker for gains of 15 and 44 yards set up Davis's second touchdown run. Then Odomes intercepted a pass from Schroeder and returned it 9 yards to the Bills 38-yard line. Buffalo drove for 62 yards and took a 41–3 lead just before the end of the half. The key player of the drive was Lofton, who caught a 36-yard pass from Kelly, and then caught an 8-yard scoring pass from him on the next play.\nThe misery would continue for Los Angeles in the second half, as their first three drives ended with interceptions. Meanwhile, Buffalo increased their lead to 48–3 with Davis's third touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later on, Talley intercepted a pass from Schroeder and returned it 31 yards to the Raiders 27-yard line, setting up Norwood's 39-yard field goal to make the final score 51–3.\nOn offense, the Bills amassed 502 total yards, including 202 yards on the ground. Running back Thurman Thomas rushed for 138 yards and a touchdown while also catching five passes for 61 yards. Running back Kenneth Davis tied an AFC playoff record with three rushing touchdowns, despite gaining only 21 yards on 10 carries. Buffalo also set an NFL playoff record by scoring 41 points in the first half. Bills quarterback Jim Kelly threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns to wide receiver James Lofton, who finished the game with five receptions for 113 yards. Thomas recorded a 12-yard touchdown run, while Davis scored from one yard, three yards, and one yard out. Linebacker Darryl Talley returned one of his two interceptions 27 yards for a touchdown.\nBuffalo recorded a total of six interceptions, the third highest total ever in a single NFL game. Mark Kelso recorded his fourth career postseason interception in the game, a Bills' record.\nFor Los Angeles, quarterback Jay Schroeder completed only 13 of his 31 passes for 150 yards. Of those 150 yards, 52 came on two 26-yard completions to Mervyn Fernandez and Willie Gault on Los Angeles's first offensive series. His five interceptions tied him with Dan Pastorini of the Oilers and Richard Todd of the Jets with what was at the time the most interceptions thrown in a playoff game since the AFL–NFL merger (eleven years later, Brett Favre would throw six in a game). That record still stands for either conference championship games or Super Bowls; twelve years after Schroeder threw five interceptions in Buffalo, Rich Gannon did so for the Raiders against Tampa Bay in Super Bowl XXXVII. Vince Evans replaced Schroeder in the fourth quarter and completed two of his eight passes for 26 yards but threw L.A.'s sixth interception of the day.\nRunning back Marcus Allen, seeking to return to Tampa seven years after winning Super Bowl MVP honors in Tampa Stadium, gained just 26 yards on 10 carries. Former Ram Greg Bell, himself a year removed from a in San Francisco, led the Raiders in rushing with 36 yards, despite only carrying the ball 5 times. Coincidentally, as was the case for the Rams a year earlier, the Raiders only scored three points the entire game during the first half of play.\nArguably, what hurt the Raiders the most (besides inclement weather conditions) was the loss of Bo Jackson. On television, both the day before and the day of the game, O. J. Simpson opined that Jackson's injury would cause him to miss both the AFC title game (and, additionally, the Super Bowl) and the start of baseball that spring. Simpson, though roundly criticized for the remark, was proven correct. So onerous was Jackson's absence that January day that, according to Mike Downey of the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Buffalo fans batted [...] a Bo Jackson inflatable doll [...] around in the stands.\nThat January day in Buffalo would be the last AFC title game appearance for the Raiders for ten years. Coincidentally, the Raiders only managed three points in \"that\" game; coincidentally, their Super Bowl opponent would have been the New York Giants; and, coincidentally, that Super Bowl was also played in Tampa, albeit this time at Raymond James Stadium.\nReferee Jim Tunney retired following this game, concluding a stellar 31-year career in which he was the referee for three Super Bowls (VI, XI and XII).\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Raiders and Bills.\nNFC: New York Giants 15, San Francisco 49ers 13.\nThe Giants were seeking their first trip to the Super Bowl since they won Super Bowl XXI, while the 49ers were looking to join the Miami Dolphins as the only other team to advance to three consecutive Super Bowls. Exactly six years after winning his second ring in four years, 49ers quarterback Joe Montana was aiming to play for (and, the 49ers hoped, to win) his fifth ring in ten years.\nFollowing their win over Chicago, Giants coach Bill Parcells mentioned travel arrangements in a team meeting during the week. Since the customary week off before the Super Bowl for this season was not on the schedule, Parcells told the team prior to leaving for Newark Airport that they had two packing options: either pack just for the trip to San Francisco, or pack for that trip and a second trip to Tampa. He then showed the team he was packing for both trips as a motivational tactic.\nIn a mostly defensive battle, 49ers running back Roger Craig's (playing in what would be his final game in a 49er uniform) fumble with 2:36 left in the game led to Giants kicker Matt Bahr's 42-yard game-winning field goal as time ran out. Bahr was New York's only scorer, as he made five out of six field goals. Although the Giants outrushed the 49ers, 152 yards to 49, the game was tied 6–6 at halftime.\nSan Francisco opened the game with a 10-play, 44-yard drive, the longest play a 14-yard reception by John Taylor. Replays showed the ball coming out of his hands as he went to the ground, but the play was ruled a catch and NFL rules at the time did not allow a replay challenge. A few plays later, Mike Cofer kicked a 47-yard field goal to make the score 3–0. New York struck back by driving 69 yards in 15 plays, including a 21-yard completion from Jeff Hostetler to Mark Ingram Sr. on 3rd and 14 (Hostetler's longest completion of the game). Near the end of the drive, Dave Meggett took the ball on a halfback option, rolled out and delivered a strike to fullback Maurice Carthon. Carthon dropped the ball in the back of the end zone. It was the closest the Giants would get to scoring a touchdown. Bahr finished the drive with a 35-yard field goal that tied the game with 2:41 left in the first quarter.\nThe second quarter was mostly uneventful, but following a few punts, New York drove 56 yards in 14 plays to take a 6–3 lead on Bahr's 42-yard field goal with one minute left in the half. However, the 49ers offense which had been dominated the entire quarter suddenly sprung to life. First, Dexter Carter returned the kickoff 27 yards to the 49ers 34-yard line. Then Joe Montana went to work, completing a 19-yard pass to Jerry Rice and rushing for a 7-yard gain, and then completing a 5-yard pass to Craig over the next three plays. A personal foul penalty on Giants lineman Eric Dorsey added 15 yards to Craig's catch and gave the 49ers a first down on the New York 21. On the next play, Montana was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Leonard Marshall, but he followed this up with two completions to Craig that advanced the ball to the 17, where Cofer kicked a 35-yard field goal that tied the score at 6 going into halftime.\nNew York had to punt on the first possession of the second half, and Taylor returned the ball 31 yards to the 49ers 39-yard line. On the next play, Taylor took in a pass from Montana while in single coverage by Everson Walls. Walls stepped in front of Taylor, but completely missed the ball, enabling Taylor to catch the pass with no one between him and the end zone, where he proceeded to take off for a 61-yard touchdown catch that gave San Francisco a 13–6 lead. New York responded by driving 50 yards and scoring with a 46-yard field goal by Bahr that made the score 13–9 with 6:06 left in the third quarter. The Giants soon had a chance to score again when Dave Meggett returned a 49ers punt 18 yards to the New York 45-yard line. Two carries by Ottis Anderson gained 36 yards and moved the ball into the red zone, but they could go no further and Bahr missed a 37-yard field goal attempt.\nIn the fourth quarter, Giants quarterback Jeff Hostetler was hit at the knees by 49ers defensive tackle Jim Burt. Hostetler was injured on the play, but walked off the field without assistance. Giants linebacker Carl Banks later recalled that the defense was infuriated by the play and looked to strike back. \"It was unspoken...that if you hurt one of our guys, we knew who to go after,\" Banks said.\nOn the 49ers' next drive, Montana called a pass play on third down. With the New York defense covering all of his receivers, Montana was forced to move outside the pocket towards his right to make a play. Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor was the first Giant to try to bring Montana down, with defensive end Leonard Marshall trailing the play, getting up from a crawl after going to the ground from a Tom Rathman block earlier in the sequence. Montana stepped back out of the path of Taylor's rush, only to move into Marshall's oncoming charge from the blind side. Marshall drilled Montana hard in the back, driving him into the turf and forcing a fumble. The 49ers managed to recover the fumble as the ball skipped past Giants cornerback Mark Collins and lineman Steve Wallace corralled the football, enabling the 49ers to punt. Marshall hit Montana so hard that he suffered a bruised sternum, bruised stomach, cracked ribs, and a broken hand. Montana would not play in another regular-season game until December 1992.\nHostetler returned for the next drive but the Giants went three-and-out. On the next play, the Giants executed the most important special-teams play of the contest. New York called a fake punt with the ball snapped directly to linebacker Gary Reasons, the upback in the punt formation, and he ran 30 yards for a first down through an undermanned 49ers defense that had only sent 10 men on to the field. Only a tackle by Taylor, the 49ers punt returner, prevented him from taking it all the way. Hostetler then drove the Giants to the opposing 21-yard line, but could get no further and nearly threw an interception on a third-down pass toward the end zone. Bahr kicked his fourth field goal of the game with 5:47 left to bring the score to 13–12.\nSteve Young came in to replace Montana on the next drive, and the 49ers tried to run as much time as they could off the clock. On the second play of the drive Brent Jones got behind the Giants defense; on his only pass attempt of the afternoon, Young hit Jones for a 25-yard gain. Two plays later, Craig recorded a six-yard gain for the 49ers' first rushing first down of the day. It would also be their last offensive first down of the game. \nThe 49ers called another run on their next play, with Craig called on to run up the middle through a hole created by guard Guy McIntyre and center Jesse Sapolu with a double team block on defensive tackle Erik Howard. However, McIntyre was forced to move off of the block to defend against linebacker Pepper Johnson, and the hole closed. Sapolu was able to push Howard down to the ground, but did so just as Craig was reaching him. While all this was going on, Taylor was converging on the play from the other side having gotten past tight end Brent Jones. Howard made contact with the football on his way down, knocking it free from Craig's hands, and Taylor was able to grab it out of the air before it hit the turf. \nWith 2:36 left and with all three timeouts, Hostetler and the Giants began driving again. He hit Mark Bavaro for 19 yards on the first play and later hit Stephen Baker for 13 more on a second down to set up a short run by Ottis Anderson for two yards and a first down. The Giants called two running plays to get the ball to the middle of the field, and with four seconds left Bahr was called on to try to win the game. His kick went through the uprights as time ran out and the Giants won 15–13.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Giants outrushed the 49ers 152 yards to 49. Anderson led all rushers with 67 yards on 20 carries. Hostetler completed 15 of 27 passes for 176 yards, threw no touchdowns, was not intercepted, and had a quarterback rating of 75 for the game. Montana, meanwhile, completed 18 of 26 passes for 190 yards and 1 touchdown for a quarterback rating of 103. Sixty-one of those yards, though, came on said touchdown pass to Taylor. Montana's quarterback rating, minus the touchdown, was 80.3 (17 of 25 for 129 yards). Craig, despite losing a costly fumble, still led the 49ers in rushing: 8 carries for 26 yards. Montana (2 carries for 9 yards) and Tom Rathman (1 carry for 4 yards) rounded out the 49ers' rushing statistics.\nAfter the game, it was speculated that, even if the 49ers had won, Young would have started the Super Bowl because of the severity and scope of the injuries Montana incurred from the hit by Leonard Marshall (see above).\nThe game was featured in the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as the End of a Dynasty.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Giants and 49ers. Both teams split the previous four meetings.\nSuper Bowl XXV: New York Giants 20, Buffalo Bills 19.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Bills and Giants."

        "title": "Steve Howe (baseball)",
        "text": "Steven Roy Howe (March 10, 1958 – April 28, 2006) was an American professional baseball relief pitcher. He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Minnesota Twins, Texas Rangers and New York Yankees, spanning 1980 to 1996. His baseball career ended in 1997 after a stint with the Sioux Falls Canaries of the independent Northern League.\nA hard-throwing left-hander, Howe was the Rookie of the Year in 1980, saved the clinching game of the 1981 World Series, and was an All-Star in 1982. However, his career was derailed by problems with alcohol and cocaine abuse. He was suspended seven times by MLB for drug-policy violations, and in 1992 he received a lifetime ban from baseball that he was able to overturn with an appeal. After each disciplinary action, he returned to show flashes of his former brilliance. He died in a single-vehicle accident in 2006, after which an autopsy identified the presence of methamphetamine in his system.\nBaseball career.\nBorn in Pontiac, Michigan, Howe played college baseball at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and was a two-time All-Big Ten selection. He made his major league debut at the age of 22 in and was the National League Rookie of the Year that year, the second in a string of four Dodger rookies of the year (Rick Sutcliffe, Fernando Valenzuela, and Steve Sax). He saved 17 games during his ROY season, establishing a new rookie record. In the following strike-shortened season, Howe helped the Dodgers win the World Series over the New York Yankees.\nHowe's career was plagued by alcohol and cocaine abuse; he first checked himself into a substance abuse clinic in , but a relapse resulted in his suspension for the entire season. Over the course of his 17-year career, Howe was suspended seven times.\nAfter briefly pitching for the Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers and being out of the major leagues for four years, Howe signed with the Yankees, where he once again pitched effectively. However, in , Howe became the second player to be banned from baseball for life because of substance abuse (the first was Ferguson Jenkins, who was also reinstated). He successfully appealed the ban and re-signed with the Yankees, where he had one final great season in , recording 15 saves and a 1.80 earned run average as the Yankees' closer. He failed to repeat the performance the following year and was relegated to a setup role, and was released in June after posting an 0–1 record with a 6.35 ERA. Howe finished his career in 1997 playing with the Sioux Falls Canaries of the independent Northern League.\nFor his career, Howe posted a record of 47 wins, 41 losses, 91 saves, and a 3.03 ERA in 497 games.\nAutobiography.\nHowe published an autobiography in 1989, the middle of his baseball career. The book, \"Between the Lines: One Athlete's Struggle to Escape the Nightmare of Addiction\" (), described his chemical dependency and hope for recovery based upon his newfound commitment to evangelical Christianity. The book was co-written with Jim Greenfield, a lawyer from the Philadelphia area.\nAfter baseball.\nFollowing his retirement from baseball, Howe worked in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, as a self-employed framing contractor. His company's name was All Star Framing.\nOn April 28, 2006, Howe's pickup truck rolled over in Coachella, California, and he was killed. He was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. The toxicology reports following his autopsy indicated he had methamphetamine in his system."

The postseason tournament concluded with the San Francisco 49ers defeating the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX, 49–26, on January 29, 1995, at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Florida.\nSchedule.\nUnder the new U.S. television broadcast contracts that took effect starting this season, Fox replaced CBS as the broadcaster of most of the NFC playoff games. ABC continued to broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games. NBC televised the rest of the AFC games. ABC was then the broadcaster for Super Bowl XXIX.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, December 31, 1994.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 16, Detroit Lions 12.\nThe Packers defense held Lions running back Barry Sanders to −1 rushing yards, while holding Detroit to 12 points and a postseason record low of −4 yards on the ground. The previous record was Chicago only giving up seven yards to New England in Super Bowl XX. Sanders lost yardage on six of his 13 carries. After running the ball on the Lions' first three plays, he didn't carry more than twice in any other series. \"It's inconceivable to hold him to negative yards,\" Green Bay defensive end Reggie White said. \"He does things that no other back does.\"\nPlaying without star receiver Sterling Sharpe, who had suffered a career-ending neck injury at the end of the season, Green Bay scored first with a 14-play, 76-yard drive. Packers quarterback Brett Favre completed 7/8 passes for 57 yards, while Dorsey Levens finished it off with a 3-yard touchdown run on fourth and inches. In the second quarter, Packers kicker Chris Jacke missed a 37-yard field goal attempt, but with 2:56 left in the half, he increased the score to 10–0 on a 51-yard field goal (a franchise postseason record) at the end of a 37-yard drive jump-started by Favre's 20-yard completion to tight end Mark Chmura. Detroit responded with Dave Krieg's 46-yard completion to Brett Perriman, earning them a first down on the Packers 11-yard line. But after two incompletions and a 1-yard loss by Sanders, Jason Hanson's 30-yard field goal attempt was no good.\nOn Green Bay's first drive of the second half, they reached the Lions 38-yard line, only to lose the ball when Edgar Bennett was tackled for no gain by Willie Clay on fourth and 1. On the next play, Krieg's 36-yard completion to Herman Moore moved the ball to the Green Bay 25, and Hanson eventually finished the drive by squeezing a 38-yard field goal inside the left upright, cutting Detroit's deficit to 10–3 with 5:58 left in the third quarter. Green Bay struck back with a 28-yard field goal by Jacke, set up by Favre's 26-yard completion to Robert Brooks, regaining a two-score advantage at 13–3. With time running out in the third quarter, Green Bay appeared to be in control of the game, but Detroit finally caught a break as Mel Gray returned the ensuing kickoff a franchise playoff record 68 yards to the Packers 18-yard line. Krieg eventually cashed in the big return with a 3-yard pass to Perriman, cutting the deficit to 13–10 with 13:35 left in the game.\nFollowing a punt from each team, Brooks' 7-yard punt return gave the Packers the ball on their 49-yard line, where they proceeded to drive to a Jacke 28-yard field goal at the 5:35 mark to make it 16–10. Once again the Lions got a big boost from their special teams unit, this time a 27-yard return by Eric Lynch that gave them a first down on the Packers 49. Detroit subsequently drove to the Green Bay 11, including a 3-yard sneak by Krieg on fourth down and 1. But over the next three plays, Sanders gained two yards, Krieg threw an incomplete pass, and then he was sacked by linebacker Bryce Paup for a 6-yard loss. On fourth down and 14 from the 17-yard line, Detroit wide receiver Herman Moore caught Krieg's pass at the back of the end zone, but came out of bounds past the end line, causing a turnover on downs. Afterwards, Green Bay ran out the rest of the clock, giving up an intentional safety when punter Craig Hentrich ran out of the end zone on the last play of the contest.\nGrey returned four kickoffs for 159 yards and a punt for 17. Paup had two sacks. Favre completed 23 of 38 passes for 263 yards, while Krieg finished 17/35 for 199 yards and a touchdown. Both teams committed no turnovers, but Green Bay massively outgained Detroit in total yards, 336 to 171.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Lions and Packers. Green Bay won the only meeting last season.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 27, Kansas City Chiefs 17.\nThis game marked the second time in December 1994 that the \"Monday Night Football\" crew came to Miami to cover a game between these two teams – on December 12, the Dolphins beat the Chiefs 45–28. Both teams produced a lot of yardage in this game (381 for Miami, 414 for KC), but the Chiefs two turnovers turned out to be a key difference, as Miami never turned the ball over at all.\nThe first half was a turbo charged shootout as both teams scored on all three of their possessions. Kansas City started it off with an 11-play, 80-yard drive in which quarterback Joe Montana, playing in what would be his last NFL game before retirement, completed all six of his passes, the last a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Derrick Walker. Miami responded with a 10-play, 72-yard drive including an 18-yard reception by Irving Fryar, who lateraled the ball to James Saxon for an additional 9-yard gain to the Kansas City 1. Bernie Parmalee ran the ball across the goal line from there, tying the game with 2:20 left in the first quarter. However, it took just four plays for Kansas City to retake the lead at 14–7 with Montana's 57-yard touchdown pass to running back Kimble Anders.\nMiami scored a 40-yard Pete Stoyanovich field goal on the next series, cutting the score to 14–10 with 12:15 left in the half. Kansas City pushed their lead back up to seven points with a 66-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard field goal by Lin Elliott. With time running out in the second quarter, Miami struck back with a 13-play, 80-yard drive in which quarterback Dan Marino converted two third downs and one fourth down, completing a 17-yard strike to O. J. McDuffie on fourth and 3 from the Chiefs 36. Marino finished the series with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ronnie Williams, tying the score at 17 going into halftime. In the first half alone, Montana completed 12/15 passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns, while Marino finished it 14/16 for 172 yards and one score.\nThe Dolphins then took the opening kickoff of the second half and marched 64 yards in six plays to score on Fryar's 7-yard touchdown reception. Stoyanovich then kicked a 40-yard field goal to give Miami a 27–17 lead. Early in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs drove from their own 44 to the Miami 5-yard line. But J. B. Brown intercepted a pass from Montana at the goal line and ran the ball back 24 yards. Then with 7:31 left in the game, Michael Stewart wrestled the ball away from Chiefs running back Marcus Allen at the Miami 34-yard line to stop a second Kansas City scoring threat.\nMontana finished his final postseason game with 314 passing yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His top target was Anders, who caught six passes for 103 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 17 yards. Marino completed 22/29 passes for 257 yards and two touchdowns.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Dolphins. Miami won both prior meetings.\nSunday, January 1, 1995.\nAFC: Cleveland Browns 20, New England Patriots 13.\nThe Browns intercepted three passes from New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe and halted an attempted comeback in the final minutes of the game to clinch the victory.\nAided by quarterback Vinny Testaverde's completions to receivers Michael Jackson and Derrick Alexander for gains of 27 and 23 yards, Cleveland moved the ball 74 yards in eight plays on their opening drive and scored on Matt Stover's 30-yard field goal. They got another chance to score when Louis Riddick returned an interception 16 yards to the Patriots 33, but they could only gain one yard on their next three plays and decided to punt.\nIn the second quarter New England took a 7–3 lead on a 60-yard drive that ended with Bledsoe's 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Leroy Thompson. However, Cleveland tight end Brian Kinchen returned the kickoff 24 yards to the Browns 49-yard line and the team quickly drove 51 yards to retake the lead at 10–7, with Testaverde rushing twice for 14 yards and completing two passes for 29 total yards to Jackson on the way to throwing a 5-yard scoring pass to Mark Carrier. New England responded by driving 71 yards in 17 plays to score on a 23-yard field goal by Matt Bahr, tying the game at 10 going into halftime. The key play of the drive was a fake punt on fourth and 10 on the Browns 43, in which punter Pat O'Neill completed a 21-yard pass to Corwin Brown.\nCleveland started the third quarter with a drive to the Pats 17-yard line, but lost the ball on an Eric Metcalf fumble that was recovered by Patriots defensive end Mike Pitts, the Browns' only turnover of the game. After forcing a punt, Cleveland drove 79 yards in nine plays. Testeverde completed a 25-yard pass to fullback Leroy Hoard and a 14-yarder to Jackson, while Hoard eventually finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown run to put the Browns back in front at 17–10.\nNew England had some success moving the ball on their next two drives, but both ended with Bledsoe interceptions. On the second one, Eric Turner picked off a pass from Bledsoe and returned the ball 28 yards to the New England 36 with seven minutes left in the game. From there, Cleveland managed to run the clock down to 3:36 before Stover's 21-yard field goal gave them a two-score lead at 20–10. However, New England put together a 63-yard drive to score on Bahr's 33-yard field goal with 1:33 remaining. New England then recovered the ensuing onside kick, but after gaining a first down, Bledsoe threw four straight incompletions and the ball was turned back to Cleveland on downs.\nTestaverde finished the game 20/30 for 268 yards and a touchdown. His top target was Jackson, who caught seven passes for 122 yards. This was the last postseason win for the Cleveland Browns until the 2020 season.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Patriots and Browns.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 35, Minnesota Vikings 18.\nBears quarterback Steve Walsh passed for 221 yards and two touchdowns as he led Chicago to a win.\nHowever, the Bears committed two turnovers on their first two possessions. On their first play from scrimmage, Lewis Tillman lost a fumble that was recovered by Henry Thomas on the Chicago 6-yard line. The Vikings then scored on Fuad Reveiz' 29-yard field goal to give them a 3–0 lead, but only after a holding penalty on center Jeff Christy eliminated Terry Allen's touchdown run. After the kickoff, the Bears lost another turnover, this time an interception by cornerback Anthony Parker, who returned it 10 yards to the Chicago 39-yard line. However, the Vikings suffered another key holding penalty, this one forcing them to punt.\nEarly in the second quarter, Chicago went up 7–3 with a 16-play, 80-yard drive (with Walsh completing 6/6 passes) that ended on Tillman's 1-yard touchdown run. Then Barry Minter intercepted a pass from Minnesota quarterback Warren Moon and returned it seven yards to the Bears 29. Walsh subsequently led the Bears 71 yards, including his 52-yard completion to Jeff Graham and finished the drive with a 9-yard scoring pass to tight end Keith Jennings. Shortly before halftime, Moon's 38-yard completion to Amp Lee set up his 4-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter that cut the score to 14–9, following a failed 2-point conversion attempt.\nIn the second half, Walsh completed a 23-yard pass to Graham and an 18-yarder to Curtis Conway before Raymont Harris' 29-yard touchdown run increased Chicago's lead to 21–9. Near the end of the quarter, Moon's 37-yard pass to Lee got the Vikings in range for Reveiz to kick a 48-yard field goal, making the score 21–12. But Walsh soon struck again with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Graham, giving the Bears a 28–12 lead. Now needing 16 points with 12:42 left in the game, Minnesota managed to drive 76 yards in 15 plays for a touchdown on Moon's 11-yard pass to Lee, but only after taking 7:06 off the clock in the process. Then Moon threw an incomplete pass on the 2-point conversion attempt, keeping the score at 28–18. The Vikings defense managed to force a punt, but after they got the ball back, Maurice Douglass forced a fumble that teammate Kevin Miniefield returned 48 yards for a touchdown.\nGraham finished the game with four receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown, along with a 3-yard run. Lee caught 11 passes for 159 yards and a score. This would be the Bears' last playoff win until the 2006 season, and their last wild-card round playoff game until the 2018 season. This was the third consecutive year the Vikings were eliminated in the Wild Card playoffs.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Bears and Vikings.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 7, 1995.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 29, Cleveland Browns 9.\nPittsburgh had defeated Cleveland twice during the season, and proved to be more than capable of doing so again. Aided by running back Barry Foster's 133 rushing yards, the Steelers controlled the game by scoring on their first three possessions and holding the ball for 42:27. The Steelers finished the game with 424 yards of offense, including 238 yards on the ground, while holding the Browns to a mere 186 total yards.\nOn Pittsburgh's opening drive, they moved the ball 65 yards in 13 plays to score on Gary Anderson's 39-yard field goal. Cleveland had to punt on their next drive, and Tom Tupa's kick went just 26 yards to the Steelers 47-yard line. Pittsburgh then went 53 yards in eight plays, including a 21-yard completion from Neil O'Donnell to Ernie Mills, to go up 10–0 on O'Donnell's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Eric Green. On the Steelers next possession, Foster rushed three times for 40 yards as the team drove 74 yards to score on John L. Williams' 26-yard touchdown burst with 9:03 left in the second quarter.\nAfter being completely dominated up to this point, Cleveland finally caught a break when Mark Carrier returned Mark Royals' 43-yard punt 20 yards to the Steelers 30-yard line, leading to Matt Stover's 22-yard field goal to cut the lead to 17–3, but in the closing seconds of the quarter, Steelers cornerback Tim McKyer intercepted a pass from Cleveland quarterback Vinny Testaverde and returned it 21 yards to the Browns 6-yard line. O'Donnell then completed a 9-yard touchdown to wide receiver Yancey Thigpen with 16 seconds left in the first half.\nIn the third quarter, the Steelers drove 72 yards to go up 27–3 on a 40-yard Anderson field goal. In the final quarter, the Browns took advantage of a 35-yard pass interference penalty on Steelers cornerback Deon Figures, converting it into a score with Testaverde's 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell. But on their next drive, the Cleveland quarterback was sacked in the end zone by Pittsburgh safety Carnell Lake for a safety with 2:45 left in the game.\nO'Donnell finished the game 18/23 for 186 yards and two touchdowns. His top receiver was Mills, who caught five passes for 117 yards. This was the first playoff win for Steelers coach Bill Cowher, who had watched his team get eliminated from the playoffs in the first round in each of the past two seasons.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Browns and Steelers.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 44, Chicago Bears 15.\nThe 49ers scored on six consecutive possessions to crush the Bears 44–15.\nChicago scored first after Joe Cain forced a fumble from 49ers tight end Brent Jones that Alonzo Spellman recovered for the Bears on the San Francisco 36-yard line. The Bears then drove 14 yards to score on Kevin Butler's 39-yard field goal with 11:02 remaining in the first quarter. However, the 49ers then scored 37 unanswered points, including 23 in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Chicago would not score again until 14:11 remained in the game.\nSan Francisco responded to Butler's field goal with a 13-play, 68-yard drive to score on fullback William Floyd's 2-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing possession late in the first quarter, Eric Davis intercepted a pass from Steve Walsh on the 49ers 46-yard line. Receiver John Taylor rushed for 15 yards and caught a pass for 15 on the first two plays as the team drove 54 yards to score on Steve Young's 8-yard touchdown pass to Jones, giving them a 13–3 lead after Doug Brien missed the extra point. Chicago had to punt on their next drive, and the 49ers scored again with a 61-yard drive that ended on a 4-yard touchdown run by Floyd to make it 20–3. On the next series, 49ers safety Merton Hanks returned an interception from Walsh 31 yards to the Bears 36-yard line, setting up Brien's 36-yard field goal. Now down 23–3, the Bears showed their desperation with 2:15 left in the half when they attempted a fake punt in their own territory. Running back Tony Carter took a direct snap, but fumbled the ball as he started to run with it, and was downed by 49ers cornerback Dedrick Dodge on the Chicago 32. San Francisco then scored another touchdown on a 6-yard run by Young, giving them a 30–3 halftime lead and setting off an end-zone brawl between both teams when safety Shaun Gayle made a late hit on Young and the quarterback responded by angrily spiking the ball at Gayle's feet.\nIn the second half, each team scored two touchdowns. On San Francisco's first drive, they moved the ball 70 yards in nine plays, including a 23-yard run by Dexter Carter, to score with Floyd's third touchdown on a 1-yard run. After this Young left the game and was replaced by Elvis Grbac. Meanwhile, Chicago had already benched Walsh at the start of the half, replacing him with Erik Kramer. This didn't help on the Bears' first two second-half possessions, but with 5:06 left in the third quarter, Kramer completed 8/8 passes for 75 yards on drive that ended with his 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Flanigan, an eligible lineman, on the second play of the final quarter.\nStill faced with a 37–9 deficit, Chicago attempted an onside kick, but 49ers tight end Ted Popson recovered it. Grbac then completed a 44-yard pass to Carter that set up San Francisco's final score on Adam Walker's 1-yard touchdown run. Chicago responded by driving 70 yards in 17 plays to score on a 1-yard run by Lewis Tillman, but by then less than six minutes remained in the game.\nSan Francisco's win was the result of a team effort. They racked up 145 rushing yards even though their leading rusher (Ricky Watters) had just 55 yards on 11 carries. Their leading receiver, Taylor had just 51 yards. Young was 16 for 22 for 143 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 32 yards and another score. The only notable performance for Chicago was that of receiver Nate Lewis, who returned five kickoffs for 125 yards.\nThis would be Chicago's last postseason game on the road until 2020.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Bears and 49ers. San Francisco won both prior meetings.\nSunday, January 8, 1995.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 35, Green Bay Packers 9.\nDallas crushed the Packers with 450 yards of offense and five touchdowns. In the first half alone, Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman completed 16 of 21 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns.\nDallas receiver Kevin Williams returned the opening kickoff 36 yards to the Green Bay 49, sparking a 51-yard drive that ended with Emmitt Smith's 5-yard touchdown run. Smith ended up leaving the game in the first quarter with a hamstring injury, but before that he racked up 44 yards and his team never lost the edge without him. Green Bay responded to the touchdown by driving 47 yards, including a 20-yard run by Robert Brooks, and scoring with a 50-yard field goal by Chris Jacke, but from this point on they would be buried under a mountain of Dallas touchdowns.\nTaking a snap from his own 6-yard line, Aikman dropped back into his own end zone and heaved a deep pass to Alvin Harper at midfield. Harper took off past Packer defenders George Teague and Terrell Buckley, made the catch, and raced all the way to the end zone, breaking a tackle attempt by Teague at the 14 on the way to a 94-yard touchdown reception. Harper's score gave the Cowboys a 14–3 lead and set an NFL playoff record for the longest play from scrimmage, breaking the old record (93 yards) set by Daryle Lamonica to Elbert Dubenion in the 1963 AFL postseason.\nDallas increased their lead to 21–3 on their next drive, with Aikman completing a 53-yard pass to Michael Irvin and a 22-yarder to tight end Jay Novacek at the Packers 1 before Smith's replacement, Blair Thomas ran the ball into the end zone from there. Green Bay struck back with a 74-yard drive, featuring Brett Favre's 59-yard completion to Brooks, to score on Edgar Bennett's 1-yard rushing touchdown. But their two-point conversion attempt failed and this ended up being their final scoring play of the game. Meanwhile, a 39-yard kickoff return by Williams set off a 52-yard drive that ended with Aikman's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Scott Galbraith with five seconds left in the half, giving Dallas a 28–9 halftime lead.\nGreen Bay had an early chance to score in the second half when linebacker Bryce Paup returned an interception from Aikman 34 yards to the Cowboys 28-yard line. But their ensuing drive was halted at the 20 and ended with no points when Jacke missed a 37-yard field goal attempt. That would be the closest they would get to scoring over the final two quarters, which included Green Bay turning the ball over on downs twice. Meanwhile, Dallas largely abandoned their passing game in the second half, but even without Smith, their rushing attack proved capable of protecting their lead. Thomas finished the game with 70 rushing yards, and added a second touchdown on a 2-yard run in the fourth quarter, making the final score 35–9.\nAikman completed 23 of 30 passes for 337 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Irvin caught six passes for 111 yards, Novacek caught 11 passes for 104 yards, and Harper caught two passes for 108 yards and a touchdown. This was the first playoff game to have three players on one team with over 100 receiving yards since the 1982 season. Brooks caught eight passes for 138 yards.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Packers and Cowboys. Both teams split the previous four meetings.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 22, Miami Dolphins 21.\nThe Chargers overcame a 21–6 halftime deficit by limiting the Dolphins offense to only 16 plays in the second half.\nMiami quarterback Dan Marino completed 14 of 18 passes in the first half for 151 yards as he led the team to three consecutive touchdowns. On their first touchdown drive, he completed 4/7 passes for 65 yards, the last an 8-yard scoring pass to tight end Keith Jackson. San Diego responded by driving 72 yards in 15 plays to score on a John Carney field goal. Receiver O. J. McDuffie returned the following kickoff 42 yards to the Miami 48-yard line, and the Dolphins ended up scoring another touchdown on Marino's 9-yard pass to Jackson, giving them a 14–3 lead with 7:21 left in the second quarter. The Chargers then drove 60 yards, including three carries by Natrone Means for 38, to score on Carney's second field goal. But this was countered again, with the Dolphins moving the ball 70 yards on a drive that featured a 24-yard reception by Irving Fryar. Marino finished it off with a 16-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mike Williams with 27 seconds left on the clock, giving the Dolphins a 21–6 halftime lead.\nIn the third quarter, San Diego drove all the way to the Dolphins 1-yard line on a 15-play drive that consumed over eight minutes, only to lose the ball on downs when Means was shoved out of bounds by defensive end Marco Coleman on a fourth down conversion attempt. However, Chargers defensive tackle Reuben Davis tackled Dolphins running back Bernie Parmalee in the end zone for a safety on the next play, sending Miami's tired defense back onto the field. San Diego then took the ensuing free kick and marched 54 yards to score on running back Means' 24-yard touchdown, cutting the score to 21–15.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, San Diego drove to the Dolphins 37-yard line, only to lose the ball when Stan Humphries threw an interception to Michael Stewart. But after forcing a punt with 3:39 left in the fourth quarter, the Chargers started a 61-yard drive that ended with Humphries' 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Seay, giving them a 22–21 lead with 35 seconds left in the game.\nThe Dolphins still had one last chance to win, as Carney's botched squib kick gave them the ball at their own 38. On the next play, a 32-yard pass interference penalty against Chargers safety Eric Castle gave the Dolphins a first down on the San Diego 30. But after two incomplete passes, Miami kicker Pete Stoyanovich was wide right on a 48-yard field goal attempt. This would be the last time the Chargers won a postseason game at home until the 2007 season\nThis game featured several questionable calls by officials. On one play, Jackson batted the ball forward along the ground after making a reception, and San Diego recovered it, but officials ruled Jackson's action to be an illegal forward pass rather than a botched lateral, allowing Miami to keep the ball. Later on, Chargers receiver Shawn Jefferson caught a 37-yard touchdown pass, but the referees ruled him out of bounds even though replays showed he was in. And on Means' 24-yard touchdown run, replays showed he had stepped out of bounds at the 2.\nMiami gained just 282 yards, with only 26 yards on the ground, both season lows, while San Diego racked up 466 yards of offense. Means rushed for 139 yards and a touchdown, while Jackson caught eight passes for 109 yards and two scores. Marino completed 24 of 38 passes for 262 yards and three touchdowns.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Dolphins and Chargers. Miami won two of the previous three meetings.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 15, 1995.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 17, Pittsburgh Steelers 13.\nThe Chargers scored 14 unanswered points in the second half to upset the heavily favored Steelers. In one of the greatest games in his career, Junior Seau recorded 16 tackles while playing with a pinched nerve in his neck. Although Pittsburgh held advantages in total plays (80–47), total offensive yards (415–226), and time of possession (37:13–22:47), it was San Diego who made the big plays.\nThe Steelers took the opening kickoff and drove 67 yards to a score on Neil O'Donnell's 16-yard touchdown pass to fullback John L. Williams. O'Donnell also made two big completions to Andre Hastings on the drive, the first for 18 yards, and the second for 11 yards on fourth down and 2. Later in the quarter, the Chargers got a big opportunity when safety Darren Carrington recovered a fumble from Steelers running back Barry Foster on the San Diego 41, but Pittsburgh's defense stepped up and forced a punt. Pittsburgh then advanced the ball to the Chargers 27-yard line, but a holding penalty pushed them out of field goal range and they ended up punting it back.\nIn the second quarter, San Diego's offense finally managed to get a drive going, with running back Natrone Means rushing for 17 yards and catching a pass for 15. On the next play, a long pass interference penalty gave them a first down on the Steelers 3-yard line, but they could not get into the end zone and settled for John Carney's field goal, cutting the score to 7–3. Pittsburgh struck back with a 12-play, 51-yard drive, including three first down completions from O'Donnell to receiver Ernie Mills, and scored on Gary Anderson's 39-yard field goal with 13 seconds left in the half. Although their halftime lead was only 10–3, Pittsburgh seemed in control of the game. They had outgained San Diego in total yards 229–46, and first downs 13–4.\nThe situation kept getting better for Pittsburgh in the second half. Humphries was intercepted by cornerback Rod Woodson on the third play of the quarter, and O'Donnell's 33-yard aerial strike to tight end Eric Green set up Anderson's 23-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 13–3. But on the fifth play of the Chargers ensuing drive, quarterback Stan Humphries faked a handoff, fooling the Steelers defensive backs long enough to find tight end Alfred Pupunu wide open to complete a 43-yard touchdown. The score was cut to 13–10 and would remain so going into the fourth quarter.\nEarly in the final quarter, Humphries completed consecutive passes to Pupunu for 31 yards, moving the ball across midfield. Then with 5:13 left in the game, Humphries threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Martin, who out-jumped Tim McKyer to make the catch and give the Chargers a 17–13 lead. O'Donnell then completed seven consecutive passes, the longest a 21-yard gain to Green that gave them a first and goal at the Chargers 9-yard line and put them in position for a potential winning touchdown. However, Foster was dropped for a one-yard loss on the next play, followed by an incompletion and a 7-yard catch by Williams. On fourth down, Chargers linebacker Dennis Gibson sealed the victory by tipping away O'Donnell's pass intended for Foster. The Steelers lost for the first time during the season in which they held a lead at halftime. (In 1994, they were 9–0 when leading at halftime prior to this game.)\nO'Donnell completed 32 of 54 passes for 349 yards and a touchdown. His top receiver was Mills, who caught eight passes for 106 yards. Humphries completed 11 of 22 passes for 165 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. This would be the Chargers' last playoff win until 2007.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chargers and Steelers. San Diego won the only prior meeting.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28.\nThis was the third straight season that the Cowboys and 49ers met in the NFC Championship Game, with Dallas winning the first two conference title games. San Francisco quarterback Steve Young still faced the pressure of \"never being able to win the big ones\", while Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman entered the game with a 7–0 win–loss record as a starter in the playoffs.\nAlthough the Cowboys eventually held a 451–294 advantage in total offensive yards, the 49ers converted three turnovers into three touchdowns in the first quarter en route to the 38–28 victory. On the third play of the game, San Francisco cornerback Eric Davis intercepted Aikman's pass, plowing right through the intended target (receiver Kevin Williams) as he snagged the ball out of the air and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. On the next Dallas possession, Davis stripped the ball away from receiver Michael Irvin and fellow defensive back Tim McDonald recovered it on the Dallas 39, setting up a 29-yard touchdown pass from Young to running back Ricky Watters, who eluded several Cowboys defenders high-stepping his way down the sideline en route to the goal line in spectacular showboating fashion. Williams then fumbled the ensuing kickoff when hit by 49ers running back Adam Walker. San Francisco kicker Doug Brien recovered the ball at the Cowboys 35-yard line, and then Young went back to work, converting a third and 1 with a 2-yard sneak and then throwing a 14-yard pass to receiver John Taylor. On the next play, Young ran the ball nine yards to the 1-yard line, and running back William Floyd took the ball into the end zone from there to give his team a 21–0 lead with 7:33 left in the first quarter.\nThis time Dallas was able to respond, driving 62 yards in eight plays and converting a third and 23 situation with a 44-yard touchdown pass from Aikman to Irvin, making the score 21–7 going into the second quarter. Then after forcing a punt, Dallas drove to a third and 10 situation on the 49ers 12-yard line. The Cowboys tried to fool San Francisco with a draw play by Emmitt Smith, but he was tackled after gaining two yards and Chris Boniol missed a 27-yard field goal on the next play. Aided by a 33-yard pass interference penalty on Larry Brown, the 49ers drove 64 yards in 11 plays, including a 10-yard catch by tight end Brent Jones on fourth and 3, to a 34-yard field goal by Brien, but Dallas countered with a 62-yard drive in which Aikman completed passes to Jay Novacek for gains of 15 and 19 yards on the way to a 4-yard rushing touchdown by Smith, closing the gap to 24–14. In the closing minutes of the first half, Aikman threw three straight incompletions, and a 23-yard punt by the Cowboys' John Jett gave San Francisco the ball on the Dallas 39 with 30 seconds left. Two carries by Floyd gained 11 yards, and then Young threw a 28-yard touchdown completion to All-Pro wide receiver Jerry Rice, who made a diving catch in the back-left corner of the end zone with eight seconds left in the first half to make the score 31–14.\nIn the third quarter, Walker muffed the opening kickoff and Dallas cornerback Dave Thomas recovered it on the 49ers 25. Aided by a personal foul penalty against linebacker Rickey Jackson, Dallas drove 25 yards in seven plays to score on Smith's 1-yard touchdown run. However, the 49ers stormed right back with a 10-play, 70-yard drive that ended with Young's 3-yard rushing touchdown. Then Deion Sanders ended the Cowboys next drive with an interception. San Francisco ended up punting, but Klaus Wilmsmeyer's kick pinned Dallas back at their 11. In the final quarter, Dallas finished an 89-yard, 14-play drive with Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin, cutting the score to 38–28, but they could not score again. Smith, who compiled 74 yards and two touchdowns, departed during that drive with an injured hamstring, which he had already injured before this game. The Cowboys had two more drives, both of which resulted in turnovers on downs. At one point, Dallas coach Barry Switzer, furious that Sanders was not called for pass interference, stormed onto the field and bumped an official while arguing, which resulted in a 15-yard penalty against the Cowboys, and Aikman was sacked by defensive end Tim Harris on fourth down on the next play. Although Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, ultimately the first-quarter turnovers were too much to overcome.\nYoung completed only 13 of 29 passes for 155 yards, but threw two touchdowns while also rushing for 47 yards and another score. Watters rushed for 72 yards and caught a 29-yard scoring reception. Williams returned six kickoffs for 130 yards, rushed for 12 yards, and caught six passes for 78 yards. Harris and defensive tackle Rhett Hall each had two sacks. Davis had two interceptions and a forced fumble.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Cowboys and 49ers. Dallas won five of the first six meetings. This is the most frequent matchup in the conference championship round since the merger.\nSuper Bowl XXIX: San Francisco 49ers 49, San Diego Chargers 26.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Chargers and 49ers."

        "title": "Tour de France Femmes",
        "text": "The Tour de France Femmes () is an annual women's cycle stage race around France. It is organised by Amaury Sport Organization (ASO), which also runs the Tour de France. It is part of the UCI Women's World Tour.\nSome teams and media have referred to the race as a 'Grand Tour', as it is one of the biggest events on the women's calendar. However, the race does not meet the UCI definition of such an event.\nAfter a one off event in 1955, an equivalent race to the Tour de France for women was held under different names between 1984 and 2009. Over the years, these races struggled with financial difficulties, limited media coverage, sexism and trademark issues with the organisers of the Tour de France. Following criticism by campaigners and the professional women's peloton, a one/two day race (La Course by Le Tour de France) was held between 2014 and 2021, and Tour de France Femmes staged its first edition in 2022.\nThe race takes place in July in the week after the men's tour, with the 2022 and 2023 editions of the race featuring eight stages. \nAll stages are timed to the finish; the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with the lowest cumulative finishing times is the leader of the race and wears the yellow jersey (\"maillot jaune)\". While the general classification garners the most attention, there are other contests held within the Tour: the points classification for the sprinters, the mountains classification for the climbers, young rider classification for riders under the age of 23, and the team classification, based on the first three finishers from each team on each stage. Achieving a stage win also provides prestige, often accomplished by a team's sprint specialist or a rider taking part in a breakaway.\nHistoric French races.\nVarious professional women's cycle stage races across France have been held as an equivalent to the Tour de France for women, with the first of these races staged as a one off in 1955. From 1984, a women's Tour de France was staged consistently, although the name of the event changed several times - such as Tour de France Féminin, Tour of the EEC Women, Tour Cycliste Féminin and Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale. French rider Jeannie Longo won the 1987, 1988 and 1989 editions of the race, gaining fame in the process.\nOver the years, these races struggled with financial difficulties, limited media coverage, sexism and trademark issues with the organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (the organisers of the Tour de France). The last of these races took place in 2009, with Emma Pooley joking that the race was \"more of a Petite Boucle than Grande.\"\nLa Course by Le Tour de France.\nIn 2013, professional cyclists Kathryn Bertine, Marianne Vos and Emma Pooley and professional triathlete Chrissie Wellington formed an activist group called Le Tour Entier (“the whole tour”), to petition ASO to launch a women's Tour de France.\nFollowing substantial media coverage, and a petition signed by over 100,000 people, ASO launched La Course by Tour de France in 2014. This race would be held in conjunction with the Tour de France, with the first edition taking place as a one-day race on the Champs-Élysées in advance of the final stage of the men's race. In subsequent years, the race took place in a variety of locations such as Pau, Col de la Colombière and Col d'Izoard in conjunction with the men's race, as the ASO argued that this was the \"best way to shine a light on female cycling\".\nThe race was initially praised for the exposure gained by 'sharing the stage' with the Tour de France, however La Course was criticised for not being a \"full Tour de France\", being overshadowed by the men's race and not having a challenging enough parcours. ASO were also criticised for not doing enough to promote the race, as well as not providing facilities for the women's peloton at the 2017 edition.\nPushing back on criticism, ASO stated that logistical issues mean that a men's and women's Tour de France would not be able to be staged simultaneously, and that any race must be financially sustainable.\nTour de France Femmes.\nIn June 2021, ASO announced that they would launch a new women's stage race, Tour de France Femmes. The first edition would take place over 8 days, following the 2022 Tour de France in July 2022. ASO also announced that Zwift would sponsor the race, with live television coverage provided by France Télévisions in conjunction with the European Broadcasting Union. The men's tour director, Christian Prudhomme stated that lessons must be learned from the failure of previous events like the Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale, and the goal of ASO is to have a financially sustainable event, one \"that will still exist in 100 years\".\nThe reaction to the launch of the event from the professional women's peloton was overwhelmingly positive, with Anna van der Breggen stating that it has \"long been a dream for many of us to compete in a women's Tour de France\" and Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig stating that \"this is a day that we’ve waited for, for a long time\".\nThe race has identical classifications to the Tour de France, with the yellow jersey for the general classification, the green jersey for the points classification, the polka dot jersey for the mountains classification, and the white jersey for the young rider (under 23) classification. The jerseys are made by Santini. Main sponsor Zwift have stated that the success of the women's 'virtual Tour de France' during the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged them to commit to sponsoring the race, with other major Tour de France sponsors like LCL, E.Leclerc and Škoda also supporting the event. The race has a prize fund of €250,000, making it the richest race in women's cycling.\n2022 edition.\nThe route of the 2022 edition was announced in October 2021 by race director Marion Rousse. The race started in Paris, with a stage finishing the Champs-Élysées on the morning of the final day of the men's race. The 8 day race culminated in a summit finish at La Planche des Belles Filles.\nThe first edition of the race took place in July 2022, with Annemiek van Vleuten winning the week long race by nearly 4 minutes, despite suffering from a stomach bug in the early stages of the race. Marianne Vos took the green jersey of the points classification and Demi Vollering took the polka dot jersey of the mountain classification, as well as finishing second overall. The race was highly praised by the public, media, teams and riders - with large crowds and high TV viewership. As the first official women's Tour de France since 1989, the race enjoyed substantial media coverage around the world. Race director Marion Rousse did note that there was room for improvement in future editions, and in women's cycling more generally.\n2023 edition.\nThe route of the 2023 edition was announced in October 2022 to praise from riders. The race started in Clermont-Ferrand on the day that the 2023 Tour de France finished, before heading south across the Massif Central towards the Pyrenees. The final stage was an individual time trial in Pau. As with the 2022 edition, the race took place over 8 stages.\nThe race was won by Demi Vollering, beating her rival Annemiek van Vleuten with a dominant stage win on the Col du Tourmalet. Lotte Kopecky won the points classification, as well as finishing second overall. Katarzyna Niewiadoma took the polka-dot jersey as winner of the mountains classification, as well as finishing third overall. For the second year in succession, the race was praised by the public, media, teams and riders. Race director Marion Rousse stated that the 2023 edition \"was the year of confirmation: we had to prove that the first edition was not just curiosity\". \n2024 edition.\nThe route of the 2024 edition was announced in October 2023. Due to the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics taking place immediately after the 2024 Tour de France, the 2024 edition will not take place immediately after the men's tour. Instead, it will take place in the short gap between the Olympic Games and the 2024 Summer Paralympics. The race will have its first \"Grand Départ\" outside France, starting in Rotterdam, with three stages in the Netherlands. The route will then head south towards the Alps, with the final stage having a summit finish at the iconic Alpe d'Huez. \nYellow jersey statistics.\nThe \"Jerseys\" column lists the number of days that the cyclist \"wore\" the yellow jersey; the \"Tour wins\" column gives the number of times the cyclist \"won\" the general classification. The next four columns indicate the number of times the rider won the points classification, the Queen of the Mountains classification, and the young rider competition, and the years in which the yellow jersey was worn, with bold years indicating an overall Tour win. \nThis table is updated until after the 2023 Tour de France Femmes.\nStage winners.\nThe following is a list of riders who have won a stage of the Tour de France Femmes \nThis table is updated until after the 2023 Tour de France Femmes.\nStarts abroad.\nThe following editions of the Tour started, or are planned to start, outside France:"

        "title": "Dave Schultz (ice hockey)",
        "text": "David William Schultz (born October 14, 1949) is a Canadian businessman and former professional ice hockey coach and player. As a player, he was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Philadelphia Flyers.\nNicknamed \"the Hammer\", Schultz is renowned as one of hockey's best enforcers and holds the NHL record for most penalty minutes in a single season, at 472. Schultz was born in Waldheim, Saskatchewan, but grew up in Rosetown, Saskatchewan.\nPlaying career.\nSchultz was known as a point producer in junior hockey, but became an \"enforcer\" in his first year of pro hockey with the Richmond Robins of the AHL, prior to joining the Philadelphia Flyers, where he would become famous.\nSchultz earned the nickname \"the Hammer\" for his aggressive style of hockey. He was one of the most notable enforcers on the Philadelphia Flyers' famous \"Broad Street Bullies\". After winning two Stanley Cups with the Flyers (1973–74 and 1974–75), \"the Hammer\" drifted through several teams (Pittsburgh Penguins, Los Angeles Kings and Buffalo Sabres) in search of a permanent position. When GMs tried to find some \"muscle\" for their fledgling clubs, they thought of him. Schultz was also able to capitalize on his popularity as a player when he recorded a local Philadelphia hit song called \"The Penalty Box\" in the mid 1970s.\nSchultz could be more than an enforcer; he scored 20 goals for Philadelphia in 1973–74. He also scored the series-winning goal in overtime in the first round of the 1974 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Atlanta Flames. Despite his successes, Schultz later expressed regret about his role as an enforcer and the prominence of fighting in hockey.\nAfter injuring his wrist in a fight, Schultz once put boxing wraps on his hands for protection. As things usually went, Schultz had several fights in ensuing games, while wearing the wraps. However, soon after, enforcers in both the National Hockey League and World Hockey Association started wearing similar hand protection. This was not to protect an already injured hand/wrist, but to protect themselves from injury in a fight. Soon after this trick became popular, both the WHA and NHL passed what became known as the \"Schultz Rule\" — thus banning the boxing wraps' temporary involvement in professional ice hockey.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter retiring as a player Schultz coached several minor league teams over the next two decades including the Madison Monsters, Baton Rouge Kingfish, and most recently the Elmira Jackals.\nSchultz co-authored a book entitled \"The Hammer\" with Stan Fischler that provides insights into the world of a professional ice hockey enforcer.\nIn 1994, he served as referee at WCW Slamboree for the match between The Nasty Boys against Cactus Jack &amp; Kevin Sullivan.\nIn 2022, he voiced himself in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Top Goon\".\nSchultz announced he was writing a book on himself to be released in the fall of 2025.\nCareer statistics.\nPlaying career.\nFigures in boldface italics are NHL records.\nCoaching record.\nSource:"

        "title": "Tennis ball",
        "text": "A tennis ball is a ball designed for the sport of tennis. Tennis balls are fluorescent yellow in organised competitions, but in recreational play other colors are also used. Tennis balls are covered in a fibrous felt, which modifies their aerodynamic properties, and each has a white curvilinear oval covering it.\nSpecifications.\nModern tennis balls must conform to certain size, weight, deformation, and bounce criteria to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as . Balls must have masses in the range . A tennis ball generally has more of a nitrogen and oxygen mixture than the sea level ambient air pressure. Yellow and white are the only colors approved by the ITF. Most balls produced are a fluorescent color known as \"optic yellow\", first introduced in 1972 following research demonstrating they were more visible on television. What color to call the ball is mildly controversial; one poll showed that a little less than half of people consider this color yellow, while a slight majority consider it green.\nTennis balls are filled with air and are surfaced by a uniform felt-covered rubber compound. Tennis ball felts comprise wool, nylon, and cotton in a mixture surrounding the rubber edge. The felt delays flow separation in the boundary layer which reduces aerodynamic drag and gives the ball better flight properties. Often, the balls will have a number in addition to the brand name. This helps distinguish one set of balls from another of the same brand on an adjacent court.\nTennis balls begin to lose their bounce as soon as the tennis ball can is opened. Tennis balls lose bounciness because the air inside the ball is pushing harder when a can is opened compared to when a ball is packaged. When packaged, the pressure in the can equally pushes the ball from the outside as the air inside the balls, preserving the pressure inside. When a tennis ball is unpackaged, its frequent use allows for air to escape from the ball. They can be tested to determine their bounce. Modern regulation tennis balls are kept under pressure (approximately two atmospheres) until initially used; balls intended for use at high altitudes have a lower initial pressure, and inexpensive practice balls are made without internal pressurization. A ball is tested for bounce by dropping it from a height of onto concrete; a bounce between is acceptable if taking place at sea-level and with relative humidity of 60%; high-altitude balls have different characteristics when tested at sea level.\nSlower balls.\nThe ITF's \"Play and Stay\" campaign aims to increase tennis participation worldwide by improving how starter players are introduced to the game. The ITF recommends a progression that focuses on a range of slower balls and smaller court sizes to introduce the game to adults and children effectively. The slowest balls, marked with red, or using half-red felt, are oversized and unpressurized or made from foam rubber. The next, in orange, are unpressurized normal-sized balls. The last, with green, are half pressured normal sized.\nHistory.\nLawn tennis, as the modern game was originally known, was developed in the early 1870s as a new version of the courtly game of real tennis. England banned the importation of real tennis balls, playing cards, dice, and other goods in the Importation (No. 2) Act 1463 (3 Edw. 4. c. 4). In 1480, Louis XI of France forbade the filling of tennis balls with chalk, sand, sawdust, or earth, and stated that they were to be made of good leather, well-stuffed with wool. Other early tennis balls were made by Scottish craftsmen from a wool-wrapped stomach of a sheep or goat and tied with rope. Those recovered from the hammer-beam roof of Westminster Hall during a period of restoration in the 1920s were found to have been manufactured from a combination of putty and human hair and were dated to the reign of Henry VIII. Other versions, using materials such as animal fur, rope made from animal intestines and muscles, and pine wood, were found in Scottish castles dating back to the 16th century. In the 18th century, strips of wool were wound tightly around a nucleus made by rolling several strips into a little ball. String was then tied in many directions around the ball, and a white cloth covering was sewn around the ball.\nIn the early 1870s, lawn tennis arose in Britain through the pioneering efforts of Walter Clopton Wingfield and Harry Gem, often using Victorian lawns laid out for croquet. Wingfield marketed lawn tennis sets which included rubber balls imported from Germany. After Charles Goodyear invented vulcanised rubber, the Germans had been most successful in developing air-filled vulcanised rubber balls. These were light and coloured grey or red with no covering. John Moyer Heathcote suggested and tried the experiment of covering the rubber ball with flannel, and by 1882 Wingfield was advertising his balls as clad in stout cloth made in Melton Mowbray. Tennis balls were initially entirely made of rubber, but they were later refined by using flannel and stitching it around the core, which used to be filled with rubber. The tennis ball quickly switched to having a hollow core, using gas to pressurize the inside. Originally, tennis ball manufacturing was done by cutting vulcanized rubber sheets into a shape similar to that of a three-leaf clover. Before the formation of the rubber into a sphere (which was executed via machinery), chemicals that reacted to produce a gas were added to produce pressure into the hollow inside once the sphere was assembled. The switch to the modem method of joining two hemispheres was done to improve uniformity of wall thickness.\nPackaging.\nBefore 1925, tennis balls were packaged in wrapped paper and paperboard boxes. In 1925, Wilson-Western Sporting Goods Company introduced cardboard tubes. In 1926, the Pennsylvania Rubber Company released a hermetically sealed pressurized metal tube that held three balls with a churchkey to open the top. Beginning in the 1980s, plastic (from recycled PET) cans with a full-top pull-tab seal and plastic lid fit three or four balls per can. Pressureless balls often come in net bags or buckets since they need not be pressure-sealed.\nDisposal.\nEach year approximately 325 million balls are produced, which contributes roughly of waste in the form of rubber that is not easily biodegradable. Historically, tennis ball recycling has not existed. Balls from The Championships, Wimbledon are now recycled to provide field homes for the nationally threatened Eurasian harvest mouse.\nIn literature.\nThe gift of tennis balls offered to Henry in Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" is portrayed as the final insult which re-ignites the Hundred Years' War between England and France.\nJohn Webster also refers to tennis balls in \"The Duchess of Malfi\"."

        "text": "The South African Open is one of the oldest national open golf championships in the world, having first been played in 1903, and is one of the principal tournaments on the Southern-Africa-based Sunshine Tour. Since 1997 it has also been co-sanctioned by the European Tour.\nHistory.\nThe first formal event was organised in 1903, following a series of exhibition matches that had been held over the preceding ten years. The championship was initially contested over just 36 holes until 1908, when it was extended to become a 72-hole tournament. Although non-whites had played in the South African Open before, most notably when Papwa Sewgolum finished second in 1963, it was not until 1972 that black golfers were allowed to compete.\nFrom 2011 until February 2020 it was held in the Johannesburg area; twice at Serengeti Golf Club, followed by five times at Glendower Golf Club, and then twice at Randpark Golf Club. In December 2020 it will move away from Johannesburg and be held at Gary Player Country Club in Sun City.\nGary Player has been the most successful player in the tournament's history, with 13 victories over four decades between 1956 and 1981. Bobby Locke won nine titles, Sid Brews won eight titles, and George Fotheringham won the event five times as did Ernie Els.\nIn December 2018, the event became part of the Open Qualifying Series, giving up to three non-exempt players entry into The Open Championship.\nThe 2021 event was scheduled to be a co-sanctioned event between the European Tour and the Sunshine Tour. However due to COVID-19 travel restrictions in place in the UK from South Africa, the event was revised as a sole-sanctioned Sunshine Tour event.\nFlagship event.\nFrom 1999 to 2016, the tournament was the Sunshine Tour's flagship event for the purposes of the Official World Golf Ranking, earning a minimum of 32 OWGR points for the winner. It was replaced as the flagship event for 2017 by the Alfred Dunhill Championship before regaining its status the following year. In 2020, the Alfred Dunhill Championship once again replaced the South African Open as the tour's flagship event. In 2021, the Alfred Dunhill Championship was scheduled to be the flagship event for the second consecutive year. However due to the cancellation of the tournament, the South African Open regained its flagship event status for the first time since the January 2020 event.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "title": "Links (golf)",
        "text": "A links is the oldest style of golf course, first developed in Scotland. Links courses are generally built on sandy coastland that offers a firmer playing surface than parkland and heathland courses.\nThe word \"links\" comes via the Scots language from the Old English word \"hlinc\": \"rising ground, ridge\" and refers to an area of coastal sand dunes and sometimes to open parkland; it is cognate with \"lynchet\". \"Links\" can be treated as singular even though it has an \"s\" at the end and occurs in place names that precede the development of golf, for example Lundin Links in Fife. It also retains this more general meaning in standard Scottish English. Links land is typically characterised by dunes, an undulating surface, and a sandy soil unsuitable for arable farming but which readily supports various indigenous browntop bent and red fescue grasses. Together, the soil and grasses result in the firm turf associated with links courses and the 'running' game. The hard surface typical of the links-style course allows balls to \"run\" out much farther than on softer turf course after a fairway landing. Often players will land the ball well before the green and allow it to run up onto the green rather than landing it on the green in the more targeted-landing style used on softer surfaces.\nGeographic location and course management.\nLinks courses tend to be on, or at least very near to, a coast, and the term is typically associated with coastal courses, often amid dunes, with few water hazards and few, if any, trees. This reflects both the nature of the scenery where the sport originated and the limited resources available to golf course architects at that time. Soil movement, for example, had to be done by hand, and thus was kept to a minimum, as was irrigation. Even today, some links courses do not employ a greens staff, use only basic machinery such as hole cutters without boards, resulting in a hole that is cut unevenly, and use grazing animals to keep the grass cropped.\nDetermining factors.\nAlthough the term links is often used loosely to describe any golf course, few golf courses have all of the design elements of true links courses, including being built on linksland. The presence of a seaside location does not guarantee a links golf course. Many famous courses regarded as links do not, as presently constituted, have all of the necessary characteristics (e.g., Pebble Beach Golf Links, Old Head Golf Links at Kinsale, The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island). On the other hand, some courses located hundreds of miles from a seacoast, such as Whistling Straits, near Kohler, Wisconsin, on the Great Lakes, can have all of the characteristics of a seaside links except for proximity to saltwater.\nNotable courses.\nLinks courses remain most common in Great Britain, especially in Scotland, as well as in Ireland. The Open Championship is always played on links courses, and this is one of the main features which differentiates it from the three major championships held in the United States. The first exception to this was the 2004 PGA Championship, which was played on a links-style course, Whistling Straits, located near Sheboygan, Wisconsin. The 2015 U.S. Open was played at Chambers Bay, a British links-style course in University Place, Washington. Royal Adelaide Golf Club is a links course in Adelaide, South Australia, and was partly designed by Alister MacKenzie, who said of the location, \"One finds a most delightful combination of sand dunes and fir trees. I have never seen a seaside course possess such magnificent sand craters, as those at Royal Adelaide.\"\nPlaying style.\nThe unique nature of links courses necessitates a distinct style of play. The challenges links traits present fall into two categories: topography, which tends to be characterised by uneven fairways, thick rough, and small, deep \"pot bunkers\"; and climatic, dominated by windy conditions created by their coastal location and lack of trees, and frequent intermittent rain squalls. \nLinks topography favours a controlled style of golf, as hazards abound. Low and even bouncing shots allow balls to be skipped onto greens rather than high flights landed with strong backspin. Windy or blustery weather also calls for low, accurate shots. Damp conditions demand concentration and caution.\nAs many traditional links courses consist of an \"outward\" nine in one direction along the coast, and an opposite \"inward\" nine returning, players often have to cope with contrasting wind patterns in each half of their round."

        "title": "Tournament of Champions (golf)",
        "text": "The Sentry is the calendar-year opening tournament of golf's PGA Tour season, played in Hawaii on the island of Maui. The tournament was founded in 1953; for most of its history the field was restricted to golfers who won a tournament on the tour during the previous calendar year, but players who qualified for the preceding Tour Championship are now invited as well. From 1986 through 2013, it was the opening event of each tour season; the PGA Tour switched to its wrap-around season (starting season in September and ending in August) in the fall of 2013. In 2022, Cameron Smith shot the lowest 72 hole to-par score in the history of the PGA Tour (−34) to win the tournament.\nHistory.\nThe Sentry is held during the first week of January and, since 1999, has been played over the Plantation Course at the Kapalua Resort near Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii. Unlike most PGA Tour events, it is a par 73 course.\nPrevious venues have been the Desert Inn Country Club in Las Vegas, Nevada, from the event's inception until 1966, and the Stardust Country Club, also in Las Vegas, in 1967 and 1968. For the following thirty years, it was played at La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California; it moved from May in 1985 to January in 1986, and relocated to Maui in 1999.\nThe tournament has had several title sponsors, the first being Mutual of New York (MONY) between 1975 and 1990. After three years of sponsorship by Infiniti, German car maker Mercedes-Benz began a sixteen-year association with the event and the Tournament of Champions name was dropped. In 2010 the tournament entered a new ten-year agreement with Korean broadcasting company Seoul Broadcasting System, with the tournament being renamed as the SBS Championship. Hyundai took over title sponsorship in 2011 with SBS remaining a sponsor. In 2017, SBS became title sponsor again after Hyundai took over title sponsorship of the PGA Tour event at Riviera Country Club. Sentry Insurance signed on as the event's title sponsor with a five-year agreement starting in 2018, later extended through 2030. \nFrom 2012 to 2015, the tournament used a Friday–Monday format, joining the Deutsche Bank Championship as the only two PGA Tour events with this format. The format allowed the tournament to have its own day to finish, and not compete against the second day of the NFL Wild Card Playoff round.\nFor the 2021 tournament, the PGA Tour announced that the field would be expanded to include the 30 players qualifying for the 2020 Tour Championship in addition to tournament winners during the 2020 calendar year. The change was made following the cancellation of ten tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 edition reverted to the usual winners-only field, but the addition of Tour Championship qualifiers was made permanent in 2023. The tournament had a name change for 2024 as a result, dropping the traditional Tournament of Champions name again.\nTelevision.\nWhile being played at LaCosta, the weekend rounds were traditionally televised by ABC Sports. However, after moving to Hawaii in 1999, the time difference was not conducive to network television. The event moved to ABC's cable partner ESPN for four-round coverage. In 2007, the event moved to four-round coverage on the Golf Channel. In 2012, NBC Sports began showing weekend play, while also producing the new Monday final round for sister network Golf Channel. Starting in 2018, Thursday-Sunday coverage split between Golf Channel and NBC, with the latter picking up weekend coverage when not in conflict with the network's broadcasts of NFL playoff games.\nWinners.\n\"Note: Green highlight indicates scoring records.\"\nMultiple winners.\nSixteen men have won the tournament more than once through 2023."

        "title": "Nick Johnson (baseball)",
        "text": "Nicholas Robert Johnson (born September 19, 1978) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter. During his career Johnson played for the New York Yankees (2001–2003; 2010), Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals (2004–2009), Florida Marlins (2009), and Baltimore Orioles (2012).\nJohnson was known for his patience and discipline at the plate, which led to him having a career on-base percentage of .399. Lifetime, with the bases loaded he had a .370 batting average, a .444 on-base percentage, 72 runs batted in, and 2 grand slams in 73 at-bats. Johnson was also the last remaining player on the Nationals' roster to relocate with the team from Montreal, before being traded to the Marlins at the 2009 non-waiver trade deadline.\nPersonal.\nHe is the nephew of Larry Bowa. Johnson and his wife, Liz, had their first child, Brianna, on January 31, 2006.\nHe graduated from C. K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento where he was teammates with future Major Leaguer Steve Holm. As a senior he was named to the all-state team and was named to the All-America Third Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings.\nMinor league career.\nJohnson was drafted by the Yankees in the third round (89th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft.\nIn , he batted .317/.466/.538 with 17 home runs in 303 at-bats for the Tampa Yankees. In , he was an All-Star for the Norwich Navigators, and batted .345/.525/.548 with 37 HBP and 123 walks in 420 official at-bats.\nHe participated in the 1999 and 2001 Futures Games during All-Star Weekend, playing for the United States team.\nJohnson has a .446 lifetime minor league on-base percentage.\nMajor League career.\nNew York Yankees.\nIn 2002, Johnson was 7th in the AL in hit by pitch (12), in just 378 at-bats with the Yankees.\nJohnson hit .284/.422/.472 with the Yankees in 2003. From May 15 to July 25, Johnson was on the disabled list due to a stress fracture in his right hand. During this time, he ranked ninth among first baseman in Runs Above Replacement, position-adjusted (RARP)—a Sabermetric statistic. Only four of the hitters ahead of him (Carlos Delgado, Todd Helton, Jason Giambi, and Jim Thome) had a better EqA, and the other four played more than Johnson. Expanding beyond his position, he would have tied with Edgar Martínez for the 17th-best EqA in baseball.\nAfter the 2003 season, the Yankees traded him, along with Juan Rivera and Randy Choate, to the Montreal Expos for Javier Vázquez.\nMontreal Expos/Washington Nationals.\nIn 2004, his first season (and last, because of their relocation to Washington at the end of the season) with the Expos, injuries struck again. He could not play until May 28 because of a back injury, and struggled after initial success. By the time his season was ended by a ball hit to first that took a bad hop and broke his cheekbone, he was down to a .251/.359/.398 line. The back injury was another troubling sign regarding his fragility; in addition, the year was considered a disappointment as far as his hitting was concerned.\nIn , with the new Washington Nationals, Johnson compiled a performance more reminiscent of his 2003 season than of his injury-riddled 2004 campaign. He hit .289/.408 (sixth-best in the league)/.479, and had a .478 on-base percentage with runners in scoring position. Johnson batted fourth in the lineup for most of the season, despite the fact that he had a much higher OBP than José Guillén, the three-hole hitter.\nJust before the 2006 season began, Johnson signed a three-year, $16.5 million contract extension, with a trade clause after the second year. In , Johnson hit .290/.428/.520, in his best year thus far. The .428 OBP was the 4th-highest in the league. He was second in the NL in walk percentage (18.0%), third in walks (110), seventh in doubles (46) and intentional walks (15), and tenth in times hit by pitch (13). He had a .454 OBP with runners in scoring position. Johnson had his worst season to date in the field, however, with 15 errors. On September 23, 2006, playing against the New York Mets at Shea Stadium, Johnson and right fielder Austin Kearns collided while attempting to catch a fly ball. Johnson sustained a broken femur and underwent surgery that night to repair the injury. He missed the entire season, though he still earned $5.5 million.\nReturning from his broken leg, Johnson played in the Nationals' spring training games in . He regained his form and competed with Dmitri Young, his replacement while injured and the 2007 recipient of the NL Comeback Player of the Year Award, for the role of starting first baseman, which he won. On March 30, 2008, Johnson knocked in the first RBI in the new baseball stadium for the Nationals. However, soon after, he sustained a tear in a ligament on the ulnar side of his wrist, and missed the rest of the 2008 season.\nThere were rumors he may be traded before the season; however, he opened the season as the starting first baseman.\nFlorida Marlins.\nOn July 31, 2009, he was traded from the Washington Nationals to the Florida Marlins for minor league pitcher Aaron Thompson. With Johnson's trade, the Nationals franchise no longer had any player on the roster who made the Montreal/Washington crossover in 2005 (although that changed again shortly after when Liván Hernández was reacquired). One of the reasons Johnson was dealt to the Marlins was because of his past history of injury.\nIn 2009, he walked 17.8% of the time, the highest percentage in the major leagues. His .426 on-base percentage was second-best in the league to St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols.\nReturn to New York.\nOn December 23, 2009, Johnson signed a one-year, $5.5 million contract to return to the Yankees. The contract also included a second-year team option. On May 8, Johnson was placed on the disabled list with a wrist injury. He required season-ending surgery after a setback in his rehabilitation in August. The Yankees declined his 2011 option, making him a free agent again.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn March 7, 2011, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. He spent the season in AAA with the Columbus Clippers.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn February 8, 2012, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He attended spring training and competed for a spot on the major league roster, which he earned. He was hitless through his first 28 at-bats for the Orioles, before finally collecting a double in a game against the Yankees on May 1. He suffered a wrist injury on June 27, 2012, and did not play again for the rest of the season.\nDue to long-lasting injuries sustained throughout his career, Johnson decided to retire from Major League Baseball on January 28, 2013."

        "title": "Shawn Camp (baseball)",
        "text": "Shawn Anthony Camp (born November 18, 1975) is an American baseball coach and former pitcher, who is the current head coach of the George Mason Patriots. He played college baseball for George Mason from 1995 to 1997. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2004 to 2014 with his longest tenure as a player with the Toronto Blue Jays. He also played for the Kansas City Royals, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Chicago Cubs, and Philadelphia Phillies.\nEarly career.\nCamp began his baseball career as a catcher at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia. He graduated from high school in 1994 and continued as a backstop in college while attending George Mason University, where he played for coach Bill Brown. Struggling to hit collegiate pitching, Camp converted to a pitcher at George Mason with the help of then Patriots assistant baseball coach Dayton Moore. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nProfessional career.\nSan Diego Padres.\nCamp was drafted in the sixteenth round of the 1997 amateur entry draft by the San Diego Padres; the 500th overall selection of that year's draft. The newly converted reliever steadily climbed the ranks of the Padres' minor league system, collecting 25 saves in his first two years of professional baseball.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn July 10, 2001, Camp was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for outfielder Emil Brown. He continued to advance in the minors, receiving an invitation to the Pirates spring training camp in 2003. Failing to make the major league team, however, Camp was granted free agency by Pittsburgh at the end of the season.\nKansas City Royals.\nIn 2004, Camp joined the Kansas City Royals organization. Signed by his former college coach and current Royals general manager Dayton Moore, Camp finally made his first major league roster. Camp made his major league debut on Opening Day, April 5. Facing the Chicago White Sox, Camp allowed two runs in two innings of work. He remained a semi-regular contributor to the Royals bullpen that season and in 2005, working primarily in middle and long relief, while shuttling between Kansas City and Triple-A Omaha.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nCamp was granted free agency after the 2005 season, and signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on January 17, 2006. From 2006 to 2007 Camp was a mainstay in the Devil Rays' beleaguered bullpen, amassing 75 appearances in 2006, second most in the American League. Control problems hampered Camp's success in Tampa Bay and his final year in Kansas City, however, and the righty struggled to poor ERAs of 6.43, 4.68 and 7.20 respectively from 2005 to 2007. Camp had particular trouble with preventing inherited runners from scoring, allowing over forty percent (22 of 54) of runners on base to reach home in his final season with the Devil Rays.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nCamp signed a minor league deal with the Blue Jays prior to the season. Prepared with a new pitch, a changeup, Camp excelled at Triple-A Syracuse and was recalled by Toronto soon after breaking camp. Limiting right-handed hitters to a paltry .204 batting average, Camp helped the Blue Jays staff to team ERA of 3.49, best in all of Major League Baseball that season. In 2009, Camp led the Blue Jays relievers with a career best 79 innings pitched, while tallying a career high 58 strikeouts.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn February 6, 2012, Camp signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners. However, a month later, the Mariners released Camp prior to the start of the season as they were eyeing youth.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn March 26, 2012, the Chicago Cubs signed Camp to a minor league deal. During the 2012 season, Camp pitched 77 innings in a league-leading 80 appearances for the Cubs. He accrued a record of 3–6, with two saves and a 3.59 ERA.\nOn November 19, 2012, Camp and the Cubs agreed to a one-year, $1.35 million contract that includes $200,000 in possible incentives. Camp pitched in 14 games in April, going 1–1 with eight runs allowed in 11 innings. In five games in May, he gave up six runs in 5 innings. On May 22, Camp was placed on the disabled list after spraining his toe, and he was replaced by Rafael Dolis. After a rehab assignment in Single-A Kane County, he returned to the Cubs on June 15. In six games in June, he gave up four runs in 6 innings. He was designated for assignment on July 3, 2013. He was released on July 9. In 26 games with the Cubs in 2013, Camp went 1–1 with a 7.04 ERA and four holds, striking out 13 in 23 innings.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nCamp signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 17, 2013. He was assigned to Triple-A Reno, where he pitched in 17 games to end the season. With the Aces in 2013, he had a 2.42 ERA, striking out 19 in 22 innings. After the year, he was a minor league free agent.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn November 11, 2013, Camp signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was outrighted to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs on May 8, 2014. Camp elected free agency the next day. He re-signed on a minor league deal on May 15, 2014, and was released by Lehigh Valley on June 27.\nOn March 9, 2015, Camp announced his retirement.\nPitching style.\nCamp was primarily a sinkerballer, throwing his 87–90 mph sinker about half the time. His other pitches included a slider (78–80) and a changeup (81–83). He tended to start with sinkers early in the at-bat and worked in more sliders later.\nCoaching career.\nOn June 26, 2019, Camp was named the pitching coach at his alma mater, George Mason. On July 8, 2022, Bill Brown stepped down as the head coach of the Patriots, and Camp was named the interim head coach."

        "text": "Kyle Ehren Snyder (born September 9, 1977) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher and current pitching coach for the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Kansas City Royals and the Boston Red Sox. During his playing days, Snyder stood tall, weighing .\nBackground.\nSnyder was born in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Riverview High School in Sarasota, Florida in 1996. While in high school, Snyder lettered in baseball, basketball, swimming, and golf. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 1996 amateur draft; however, Snyder chose to attend North Carolina instead, where he played college baseball for the Tar Heels.\nSnyder played three years for North Carolina, and in 1998 played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham Athletics of the Cape Cod Baseball League where he was named the top prospect. In summer 1997, Snyder played in the Valley Baseball League, for the Winchester Royals.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1999, Snyder was a first round MLB draft pick (7th overall) of the Kansas City Royals. He played for the Spokane Indians in 1999 and was named top prospect in the Northwest League by \"Baseball America\".\nSnyder’s career with the Royals was hampered by several injuries. He only pitched two games in 2000 and missed the entire 2001 minor league season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Between 2003 and 2005, Snyder was on the disabled list four times including two stays on the 60-day disabled list, missing the entire 2004 season after having surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Despite his history with injuries, Snyder was named the seventh-best prospect in the organization by \"Baseball America\" in 2003.\nSnyder started the 2006 season with the Royals' Triple-A affiliate, the Omaha Royals, and was promoted to the major leagues on June 8, 2006, to face the Texas Rangers. After giving up \nnine runs (five earned) and ten hits in a two inning start, he was designated for assignment.\nIn June 2006, Snyder was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox. He split the remainder of the season between Boston and the Pawtucket Red Sox.\nSnyder is perhaps best known in Boston for his 4 inning relief effort for the Red Sox in a July 31, 2006 game against the Cleveland Indians. Entering the game with Boston trailing 8-6 in the fifth inning, Snyder held the Indians scoreless before David Ortiz hit a walk-off three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Red Sox a stunning 9-8 victory. Snyder allowed only one hit while walking none and striking out six.\nSnyder's first full season in the big league was in 2007, when he appeared in 46 games, one more than his previous three professional years combined. In January 2008, Snyder signed a one-year contract with the Red Sox avoiding the arbitration process.\nIn April 2008, Snyder was designated for assignment to make room for Josh Beckett, who was returning from the 15-day disabled list. Later in the month, Snyder accepted an assignment to remain in the Red Sox organization with Triple-A Pawtucket. He was granted free agency after the 2008 season and signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in January 2009. After playing sparingly through the 2011 season, for multiple minor league teams, Snyder retired as an active player.\nCoaching.\nIn 2012, the Tampa Bay Rays hired Snyder as pitching coach for the Short-Season A level Hudson Valley Renegades.\nStarting the 2013 season, Snyder was the pitching coach for the Bowling Green Hot Rods (A). The Rays promoted him to the Durham Bulls for the 2015 season. The Rays promoted him to be the MLB pitching coach for the 2018 season, replacing longtime pitching coach Jim Hickey."

        "title": "Prestwick Golf Club",
        "text": "Prestwick Golf Club is a golf course in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. It is approximately southwest of Scotland's largest city, Glasgow. Prestwick is a classic links course, built on the rolling sandy land between the beach and the hinterland. The course is near the Prestwick airport, and some holes run along railway tracks on the eastern side of the course.\nThe Open Championship originated at Prestwick Golf Club, and was played there 24 times between 1860 and 1925.\nHistory.\nGolf had been played over the links at Prestwick for many years before the club was formally organized in 1851. Old Tom Morris was the club's \"Keeper of the Green, Ball and Club Maker\" from 1851 to 1864. He designed and built the original 12-hole course, which measured 3,799 yards, 578 of which were on the first hole. In common with other courses, many of Prestwick's original holes crossed over the same undulating terrain; no more than two dozen golf clubs existed anywhere in the world at that time. Six of the original greens are still used by the present 18-hole course, which also includes three of the original holes: 2nd (Alps), 4th (Cardinal) and 5th (Sea Headrig).\nMorris, originally from St Andrews, returned there to take charge of their links in 1865, but also assisted Prestwick when it extended its course to 18 holes in 1882 after the club acquired significantly more land to the north of its original lay-out. With the course's expansion to 18 holes, which had become the game's standard, cross-routing was eliminated.\nOriginates the Open Championship.\nPrestwick is famous as the initial originator and sponsor of The Open Championship, the oldest of golf's four major championships. Discussion of The Open's future concept began soon after the 1859 death of Allan Robertson, longtime professional at St Andrews, who had been considered supreme for some 20 years until his death; the concept of the Open was to find the new 'champion golfer'.\nThe first Open was held in October 1860, with three trips in one day over the course's 12 holes to make for 36 holes; the field consisted of eight leading professionals. The winner was presented with a red Morocco Belt with silver clasps purchased by the members at a cost of £25. The club annually staged all the Opens up to 1870, as well as the 1872 Open; cash prizes were also awarded to leading finishers. Young Tom Morris, son of Old Tom, learned his golf from boyhood at Prestwick, and captured four consecutive Opens held there from 1868 to 1872 (there was no Open in 1871). By winning the Belt three straight times, Young Tom was entitled under the conditions of the competition to keep it, so there was no prize to play for in 1871, and hence no Open.\nPrestwick remained in the Open's rotation until 1925, hosting the championship 24 times in all, which is second only to the Old Course. In 1925 crowd control became very problematic, as thousands of people overwhelmed the marshals, which were far too few in number to control them, and this situation disrupted the play of the championship, affecting the outcome, since many players' shots hit spectators and were deflected. Bernard Darwin, the era's leading golf writer, reported from the scene that he doubted the Open should be held ever again at Prestwick, and such has proved the case. The course's cramped layout does make hosting of events with large galleries highly problematic, although the course's challenge remains intact to test the modern generation of players. Prestwick has also staged the Amateur Championship on eleven occasions, most recently in 2001.\nNatural features.\nThe River Pow, or the Pow Burn, flows through the golf club's property, and the river is a natural obstacle, there are fish and other species of rare nature in the river, so nature watchers are welcome there.\nThere are several sand dunes in the centre of the course. The tallest of the three is Pow Hill, the next tallest is The Queens Jack, and the third tallest is Cearcevlock Hill. Blind shots from the tee at the short fifth and on the approach to the par-4 17th add considerably to the mystery and charm of the course. The most famous hole is the third, a par 5, dogleg right, of 500 yards, where the fairway simply ends about 300 yards from the tee, as the land descends into a vast, deep bunker, nicknamed the 'Cardinal', about 50 yards across, which is buttressed by railway sleepers. Many championship hopes have died in this bunker. The Pow Burn flanks the hole down its entire right side. The Irish Sea / Firth of Clyde forms the western boundary of the course, flanked by sand dunes. The Royal Troon Golf Club sits immediately to the north of Prestwick's course and nearby Turnberry is down the coast, to the southwest.\nLike many of Scotland's other leading courses, Prestwick is a private members' club, but visitors may book to play the course on most days of the week.\nThe Open Championship.\nThe winners of The Open Championship at Prestwick Golf Club.\n(a) denotes amateur"

        "text": "Royal Portrush Golf Club is a private golf club in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The 36-hole club has two links courses, the Dunluce Links (the championship course) and the Valley Links. The former is one of the courses on the rota of the Open Championship and last hosted the tournament in 2019.\nIn 1951, Royal Portrush first hosted the Open Championship, the oldest of golf's major championships; it was the first Open tournament not held on the island of Great Britain. The Open returned to Portrush in 2019, and it will host again in 2025. It also hosted the Irish Open in 2012, the first in Northern Ireland since 1953.\nThe Dunluce Links course is considered to be one of the best courses in the world. It was ranked fourth by \"Golf World\" in their list of \"The 100 greatest courses in the British Isles\" in November 1996. \"Golf Magazine\" ranked it twelfth in their list of the Top 100 Courses in the World, and \"Golf Digest\" ranked it as the fourth best course outside the United States in 2007.\nLocation.\nSituated on the North Antrim Causeway Coast, Royal Portrush occupies a triangle of giant sand hills with views of the hills of Inishowen in County Donegal in the west, the Isle of Islay and Southern Hebrides in the north, with the Giant's Causeway and the Skerries in the east. The course is overlooked by the ruins of the 13th century Dunluce Castle, which gives its name to Dunluce course.\nHistory.\nThe Royal Portrush Golf Club was founded in 1888 as The County Club. It became The Royal County Club in 1892 under the patronage of the Duke of York and assumed its present name in 1895 under the patronage of the Prince of Wales. In 1947, Rathmore Golf Club member Fred Daly became the first Irishman to win The Open Championship, and four years later the club hosted the championship itself, the first time the event was held in Northern Ireland. The club has also hosted the Senior British Open Championship between 1995 and 1999 and again in 2004. The club was also host to the 2010 Palmer Cup. Daly's feat was repeated by club member Darren Clarke in 2011. Clarke also named Royal Portrush his favourite golf course in the world.\nThe second course at Royal Portrush is the Valley Links, and is used mostly by members of the 'town' club Rathmore and the ladies and juniors of Royal Portrush. It is shorter and considered less demanding than the Dunluce Links. Rathmore clubhouse and the ladies clubhouse are situated adjacent to the first tee. A six-hole pitch and putt course, named Skerries, starts from the same location. There is also a driving range at the club.\nRathmore Golf Club.\nThe Valley Links is the home of Rathmore Golf Club whose clubhouse is situated near the first tee. Famous members include 1947 Open Champion Fred Daly and 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell.\nSignature holes.\nOn the Dunluce course at Portrush there are several signature holes on both the front and back nine. In particular are the fourth, fifth and sixteenth holes. The fourth hole is a long par four which is more than 480 yards from the championship tees, with out of bounds right and thick rough on the left. There are several bunkers in the undulating fairway and the green is placed between two small sand hills. The fifth hole is a relatively short downhill par four with a dogleg to the right. It has no bunkers but a heavily undulating green perched on the edge of a large drop down to the beach and has views across the White Rocks beach, and the Dunluce Castle after which the course was named. The sixteenth hole, named Calamity Corner is a long 236 yard, uphill par three. It is played to a green over a huge ravine short and right, with mounds and hollows to the back and left of the green.\nThe Open Championship.\nThe Open Championship was first staged at Royal Portrush in 1951; Max Faulkner won his sole major championship. The Open next returned to Portrush \nA number of course changes were made in preparation for the 2019 Open. The 17th and 18th holes of the original Dunluce Links, the Championship course, were replaced by two new holes (the 7th and 8th) on land that was part of the Valley Links. Holes 7 to 16 were redesignated as holes 9 to 18 on the redesigned course. The land freed-up by removing the prior 17th and 18th holes was used for the tented village. There were number of other changes, including lengthening the 2nd hole by and realigning the 10th (the new 12th). Despite the newly designed Dunluce Links reducing the course from a par 72 to a par 71, the overall length increased by almost to . The total number of bunkers also increased from 59 to 62. Since the Valley Links lost two holes to the Dunluce Links, a number of changes are also having to be made to that course.\nShane Lowry was victorious in the 2019 Open Championship.\nIrish Open.\nThe club's Dunluce course held the 2012 Irish Open which was won by Jamie Donaldson. This was the first time that a European Tour event had been played in Northern Ireland and the first time since 1953 that the Irish Open had been played in Northern Ireland; it was last played at Royal Portrush in 1947.\nScorecards.\nDunluce Links – Championship tees\nValley Links – Championship tees"

        "title": "Golf Canada",
        "text": "The Royal Canadian Golf Association (RCGA), branded as Golf Canada, is the governing body of golf in Canada.\nBeginnings.\nIt was founded as the Canadian Golf Association on June 6, 1895, at the Royal Ottawa Golf Club. The 'Royal' prefix was granted in June 1896 by Queen Victoria through the Governor General of Canada at that time, Lord Aberdeen, who was a patron of the association.\nThe first real international boom in golf happened during the 1890s. In response to this, the first golfing associations were formed – the Golfing Union of Ireland in 1891 and the Ladies' Golf Union in 1893. The organization of golf in Britain itself was directed to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews as the historic seat of golf. In 1894, two attempts to establish a national championship in the United States were made, neither of which became recognized as the national championship. Later in 1894, representatives from five prominent U.S. clubs gathered to form the United States Golf Association.\nFounding, stages Canadian Amateur.\nThe first meeting to discuss the formation of a Canadian Golf Association was held on June 6, 1895, at the Royal Ottawa Golf Club. The secretary of the club, Alex Simpson, was a strong proponent of organizing a national organization to conduct national championships. In 1895, he invited clubs from across Canada to attend \"the first national golf championship\" and to discuss the organization of an association with the mandate of conducting such events. It was agreed that such an association should be formed and would hold its first Annual General Meeting on September 27, at the time of the Interprovincial Matches between Ontario and Quebec.\nThe constitution drawn up for the purpose stated the objectives of the organization as:\n\"promote interest in the game of golf; the protection of the mutual interests of its members; establish and enforce uniformity in the rules of game by creating a representative authority,; its Executive Committee to be a court of reference as a final authority in matters of controversy; to establish a uniform system of handicapping; to decide on what links the Amateur and Open Championship shall be played.\"\nThe constitution was signed by the following ten clubs from across Canada:\nThe first officers of the organization were:\nThe prefix 'Royal' was granted in June 1896 by Queen Victoria. There were two categories of membership in the RCGA when it was formed – 'Allied', which meant it was a regularly constituted golf club in Canada, and 'Associate', which was also to have a golf course, clubhouse and at least 25 members.\nMembership in the RCGA was:\nCanadian Open.\nThe Canadian Amateur Championship was to continue annually as it had operated in 1895, at match play, with the prize the Aberdeen Cup, donated by the Governor-General. In 1898, the RCGA, in conjunction with the USGA, conducted the first International Golf Matches at the Toronto Golf Club. In 1901, the organization introduced the Canadian Ladies' Amateur Championship, held at Royal Montreal Golf Club. Three years later, the need for an Open championship for both amateur and professional golfers was determined, with sufficient professional golfers in Canada, and the first Canadian Open Golf Championship was held over the Royal Montreal Golf Club in 1904.\nOrganizational details.\nThe RCGA formed its first standing committee for the rules of golf in 1916, although it had printed its first edition of the rules in 1914.\nIn 1919, the first staff person, B.L. Anderson, was hired. He had served as volunteer secretary during World War I, and was hired for part-time work for the association as the Secretary-Treasurer. Anderson stayed with the RCGA as Secretary until retirement in 1945. He became known as the face of the RCGA, along with his own secretary, Marion Doherty.\nFunding continued as a fee per club until 1948, when the RCGA instituted the dollar a year plan. The concept was that each golf club would remit $1.00 for each male member (after having collected from the member in their annual dues). $0.50 was to go to the RCGA and the same amount would be remitted to the appropriated provincial association. This revolutionized the associations which had suffered for decades from chronic lack of funding. \nThe first handicapping system sponsored by Canada was done in 1937, believed to be based upon an American system, using the five lowest scores of the current season. The second system was presented in 1949 on an interim basis, and officially in 1950. It was revised again in 1960, and several times afterwards.\nIn 1924, the Canadian Ladies' Golf Union (formed in 1913) took over the operation of the Canadian Ladies' Amateur Championship from the RCGA.\nSince 2003, Golf Canada has had the Team Canada program as a staple for the Organization. The Goal of this program is to develop young Men and Women Golfers to become top ranked Amateurs. The program has a rigorous selection each November to place golfers on either the National or Junior teams. Team Canada has participants active year round, and provides both physical and mental coaching for golfers. \nWillingdon Cup.\n1927 saw the resurrection of the Interprovincial Team Matches. These matches had been played since 1882, primarily between Quebec and Ontario. Discontinued in 1921, the need to improve the national scope of the association, and in particular its championships, coincided with the concept of team expenses provided being allowed. To ensure the \"cream\" of the amateur players in each province were available to participate in the Amateur (notwithstanding long distance travel), the Interprovincial Matches were reintroduced as the \"Willingdon Cup Matches for the Interprovincial Championship\" encouraging each province to send a team of four to the Amateur. The Governor General, Lord Willingdon, provided the cup which is still played for today. The Willingdon Cup matches have likely done more than any other event to raise the standard of amateur golf in Canada.\nJunior Championship.\nIn the 1930s, the national body was approached about beginning a national junior championship. In 1938, a new element was added to the Amateur Championship – that of Junior Title holder. A junior from each province could accompany the Willingdon Cup team as an alternate, and participate in the Amateur. The low scorer would become the Junior Champion. In 1959, the tournament was separated from the Canadian Amateur Championship, and became a full-fledged match play tournament in its own right. A juvenile component was added in 1970, and interprovincial team matches had been added to the tournament in 1959. Both tournaments are run at stroke play today.\nSenior Championship and others.\nIn 1962, the RCGA introduced its first Senior Championship of Canada. The Canadian Senior Golf Association had been formed in 1918 and conducted its own championship. However, by 1962, it became clear that there was a need for another tournament. The Senior Championship of Canada was established as an RCGA event, open to any member of any RCGA member club. The CSGA was/is a membership based organization and fulfills a largely social element of the game.\nIn 1986, the Canadian Club Champions' Championship was introduced, followed by the Mid-Amateur Championship in 1987.\nCanada in international golf.\nGolf Canada also has a long history of sending teams to international competitions. The first overseas team was formed in 1935 to go to the United Kingdom, to play in the British Amateur Championship, and in a number of relatively informal team matches. In 1954 the first official RCGA team event took place with the introduction of the Americas Cup Matches. Played between 1954 and 1967, these matches were played between Mexico, the USA and Canada. The Canadians brought home the honours in 1965. Other International events Golf Canada has been much involved in are the World Amateur Team Matches for the Eisenhower Trophy, since 1958: winning in 1986, placing second in 1962, 1964, 1978, 2006, and 2014, and hosting these \"Olympics\" of golf in 1992; the Commonwealth Tournament matches, won by Canada in 1971 and 1975, discontinued in 1975; and the Simon Bolivar Biennial Tournament, won in 1981 by Doug Roxburgh and Gary Cowan representing Canada.\nDuring the 2016 Rio Olympics, Team Canada participated in the first golf competition in over 100 year. Selected for the team on the men's side were Graham DeLaet and David Hearn. DeLaet finished 20th overall, while Hearn finished 30th. For the Women Brooke Henderson and Alena Sharp participated. Henderson finished in a tie for 7th, while Sharp finished 30th. \nAgronomy, history.\nThe RCGA also recognized the needs of the game outside of tournament play and first began a Green Section in the 1920s. Although this faded in and out throughout the next several decades, it continued until ending in 2007. In the 1950s, golf architect agronomist Robbie Robinson served the RCGA in a number of positions, including as general manager. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the RCGA operated a consulting program which was operated through part-time consultants. In 1991 the Association hired a permanent staff person for the Green Section, and has been involved in developing environmental guidelines, among other key materials, for golf courses today.\nIn the 1950s, the RCGA first began collecting \"relics\" of the game, to preserve the history of Canadian golf. In 1975, with the move to Glen Abbey Golf Course, the RCGA established a golf museum and a location to showcase the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame, established in 1971. With the donation of $800,000 from the Shore Foundation, a building was erected at Glen Abbey as a home for the museum, the Hall of Fame and a library/archive on the game.\nPermanent site for Canadian Open.\nIn the 1970s, the RCGA made the decision to move the Canadian Open to a permanent site at Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, along with headquarters of the association. The RCGA purchased the golf course in the early 1980s, and held the national open championship over the course from 1977 to 2000, with the exceptions of 1980 and 1997, when it was moved to Royal Montreal Golf Club. In 1999, the RCGA completed the sale of the property to ClubLink Corp. The Canadian Open returned to Glen Abbey in 2004, and was played there again in 2008 and 2009. The tournament once more moves around the country to top courses.\nGlen Abbey is home to Golf Canada and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame, and it has hosted 25 Canadian Open Championships, more than any other course. The owner since 2005, Clublink Corp, filed an application in October 2015 to redevelop the property into a residential community, with offices and retail stores. There was no provision for a golf course in the plan. The Town of Oakville Council responded in August 2017 by declaring the golf course a heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act. This would make it more difficult for ClubLink to develop the area as it had planned, with 3,222 housing units and of retail and commercial space. Golf Canada was also concerned since it could not predict whether it could get the necessary permit to hold the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey in 2018.\nAmalgamation with Ladies' Association.\nThe Royal Canadian Golf Association merged with the Canadian Ladies' Golf Association in January 2005, and now administers the game for both men and women. The tournaments conducted by the association include:\nServices.\nOther programs of Golf Canada include a Canada-wide Agronomy Program, a Player Development division dedicated to providing opportunities for top golfers to reach their potential in competitive golf, the RCGA Foundation which raises funds for Golf Programs at Canadian Universities, and the Golf Programs and Services Division which operates the CN Future Links program, Handicapping and Course Rating, the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame and Museum and maintaining the Rules of Golf."

        "title": "Canadian Open (golf)",
        "text": "The Canadian Open () is a professional golf tournament in Canada. It is co-organized by Golf Canada (formerly known as the Royal Canadian Golf Association) and the PGA Tour. It was first played in 1904, and has been held annually since then, except for during World War I, World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the third oldest continuously running tournament on the tour, after The Open Championship and the U.S. Open.\nTournament.\nAs a national open, and especially as the most accessible non-U.S. national open for American golfers, the event had a special status in the era before the professional tour system became dominant in golf. In the interwar years, it was sometimes considered the third most prestigious tournament in the sport, after The Open Championship and the U.S. Open. This previous status was noted in the media in 2000, when Tiger Woods became the first man to win The Triple Crown (all three Opens in the same season) in 29 years, since Lee Trevino in 1971. In the decades preceding the tournament's move to an undesirable September date in 1988, the Canadian Open was often unofficially referred to as the fifth major.\nThe top three golfers on the PGA Tour Canada Order of Merit prior to the tournament are given entry into the Canadian Open. However, prize money won at the Canadian Open does not count towards the Canadian Tour money list.\nCelebrated winners include Hall of Fame members Leo Diegel, Walter Hagen, Tommy Armour, Harry Cooper, Lawson Little, Sam Snead, Craig Wood, Byron Nelson, Doug Ford, Bobby Locke, Bob Charles, Arnold Palmer, Kel Nagle, Billy Casper, Gene Littler, Lee Trevino, Curtis Strange, Greg Norman, Nick Price, Vijay Singh, Mark O'Meara, and Tiger Woods. The Canadian Open is regarded as the most prestigious tournament never won by Jack Nicklaus, a seven-time runner-up. Diegel has the most titles, with four in the 1920s.\nIn the early 2000s, the tournament was still being held in early September. Seeking to change back to a more desirable summer date in the schedule, the RCGA lobbied for a better date. When the PGA Tour's schedule was revamped to accommodate the FedEx Cup in 2007, the Canadian Open was rescheduled for late July, sandwiched between three events with even higher profiles (The Open Championship the week prior, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational the week after, and the PGA Championship the week after that). The tournament counts towards the FedEx Cup standings, and earns the winner a Masters invitation.\nIn 2019, due to a re-alignment of the PGA Tour and major scheduling, the Canadian Open moved to early-June prior to the U.S. Open. The event was also added to the Open Qualifying Series, allowing up to three of the top-ten finishers to qualify for the Open Championship.\nThe 2020 event, originally scheduled for June 11 to 14 at St. George's Golf and Country Club in Toronto, was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 9, 2021, Golf Canada announced that the 2021 tournament would be cancelled as well.\nCourses.\nGlen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, has hosted the most Canadian Opens, with 30 to date. Glen Abbey was designed in 1976 by Jack Nicklaus for the Royal Canadian Golf Association, to serve as the permanent home for the championship.\nIn the mid-1990s, the RCGA decided to move the championship around the country. The owner of Glen Abbey since 2005, Clublink Corp filed an application in October 2015 to redevelop the property into a residential community, with offices and retail stores. There was no provision for a golf course in the plan. The Town of Oakville Council responded in August 2017 by declaring the golf course a heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act, which would make it more difficult for ClubLink to develop the area as it had planned. Golf Canada was also concerned since it could not predict whether it could get the necessary permit to hold the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey in 2018 as it had planned. The dispute between the Town of Oakville and ClubLink remains before the courts as of November 2018. The 2019 Open will be held at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. The event may again be held at Glen Abbey in some future years if the planned redevelopment by Clublink is not allowed to proceed. The 2023 Open was held at the Oakdale Golf &amp; Country Club.\nRoyal Montreal Golf Club, home of the first Open in 1904, ranks second having hosted the event ten times. Mississaugua Golf &amp; Country Club and Hamilton Golf and Country Club have each hosted six Opens while Toronto Golf Club and St. George's Golf and Country Club have hosted five Opens. Three clubs have each hosted four Opens: Lambton Golf Club, Shaughnessy Golf &amp; Country Club, and Scarboro Golf and Country Club.\nThe championship has for the most part been held in Ontario and Quebec, between them having seen all but nine Opens. New Brunswick had the Open in 1939, Manitoba in 1952 and 1961, Alberta in 1958, and British Columbia in 1948, 1954, 1966, 2005 and 2011.\nThe 2002 event was held on the south course at Angus Glen Golf Club, while the 2007 event was held on the north course.\nHistory.\nThe Royal Montreal Golf Club, founded in 1873, is the oldest continuously running official golf club in North America. The club was the host of the first Canadian Open championship in 1904, and has been host to nine other Canadian Opens, at two locations, with the club moving to its current site on an island west of Montreal in 1959. The 1912 Canadian Open at the Rosedale Golf Club was famed American golfer Walter Hagen's first professional competition. In 1914, Karl Keffer won the event, being the last Canadian-born champion.\nEnglishman J. Douglas Edgar captured the 1919 championship at Hamilton Golf and Country Club by a record 16-stroke margin; 17-year-old amateur prodigy Bobby Jones (who was coached by Edgar) tied for second. The 1930 Canadian Open at Hamilton was another stellar tournament. Tommy Armour blazed his way around the course over the final 18 holes of regulation play, shooting a 64. Four-time champion Diegel and Armour went to a 36-hole playoff to decide the title. Armour shot 138 (69-69) to defeat Diegel by three strokes.\nToronto's St. Andrews Golf Club hosted the Open in 1936 and 1937 – the only course to hold back-to-back Opens until the creation of Glen Abbey – before it felt the impact of the growth of the city, and was ploughed under to allow for the creation of Highway 401. The Riverside Golf and Country Club of Rothesay, New Brunswick was host to the 1939 Canadian Open where Harold \"Jug\" McSpaden was champion. This was the only time the Open has been held in Atlantic Canada.\nScarboro Golf and Country Club in eastern Toronto was host to four Canadian Opens: 1940, 1947, 1953, and 1963. Three of these events were decided by one stroke, and the only time the margin was two shots was when Bobby Locke defeated Ed Oliver in 1947. With his win at Scarboro in 1947, the golfer from South Africa became just the second non-North American winner of the Canadian Open. Locke fired four rounds in the 60s to finish at 16-under-par, two strokes better than the American Oliver. After the prize presentation Locke was given a standing ovation, and was then hoisted to shoulders by fellow countrymen who were then residents of Canada.\nIn 1948, for the first time, the Canadian Open traveled west of Ontario, landing at Shaughnessy Heights Golf Club in Vancouver, British Columbia, where Charles Congdon sealed his victory on the 16th hole with a 150-yard bunker shot that stopped eight feet from the cup. The following birdie gave him the lead, and Congdon went on to win by three shots.\nMississaugua Golf &amp; Country Club has hosted six Canadian Opens: 1931, 1938, 1942, 1951, 1965, and 1974. The 1951 Open tournament was won by Jim Ferrier, who successfully defended the title he had won at Royal Montreal a year earlier. Winnipeg's St. Charles Country Club hosted the 1952 Canadian Open, and saw Johnny Palmer set the 72-hole scoring record of 263, which still stands after more than 60 years. Palmer's rounds of 66-65-66-66 bettered the old 1947 mark set by Bobby Locke by five shots. In 1955, Arnold Palmer captured the Canadian Open championship, his first PGA Tour victory, at the Weston Golf and Country Club.\nMontreal, Quebec's Laval-sur-le-Lac hosted the 1962 Open where Gary Player was disqualified after the first round, when he recorded the wrong score on the 10th hole. He had won the PGA Championship the week before. Californian Charlie Sifford attended the 1962 Canadian Open in part to raise the profile of African-American players on the PGA Tour. He was one of only 16 of the top 100 players on tour to play there in 1962.\nPinegrove Country Club played host to the Canadian Open in 1964 and 1969. Australian Kel Nagle edged Arnold Palmer and Raymond Floyd at the 1964 Open to become, aged almost 44 at the time, the oldest player to win the title. Five years later, Tommy Aaron fired a final-round 64 to force a playoff with 57-year-old Sam Snead. Aaron won the 18-hole playoff, beating Snead by two strokes (70-72).\nThe small town of Ridgeway, Ontario in the Niagara Peninsula was host of the 1972 Open at Cherry Hill Golf Club. A popular choice of venue, it drew rave reviews by the players, specifically the 1972 champion Gay Brewer, who called it the best course he had ever played in Canada, and Arnold Palmer, who suggested the Open be held there again the following year. In 1975, Tom Weiskopf won his second Open in three years in dramatic fashion at the Blue Course of Royal Montreal's new venue, defeating Jack Nicklaus on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff, after almost holing his short-iron approach. Windsor, Ontario's Essex Golf &amp; Country Club was host of the 1976 Canadian Open, where Nicklaus again finished second, this time behind champion Jerry Pate. Essex came to the rescue late in the game, when it was determined that the newly built Glen Abbey was not yet ready to host the Canadian Open. The 1997 Open at Royal Montreal was the first time Tiger Woods ever missed a professional cut, after winning the Masters Tournament a few months before.\nAngus Glen Golf Club was host to two recent Canadian Opens, 2002 and 2007. In 2007 Jim Furyk became one of a few golfers who have won two consecutive Canadian Open titles, joining James Douglas Edgar, Leo Diegel, Sam Snead and Jim Ferrier. Angus Glen owns the unique distinction of having each of its two courses (North and South) host the Canadian Open.\nGlen Abbey Golf Club of Oakville, Ontario has hosted 30 Open Championships (1977–79, 1981–96, 1998–2000, 2004, 2008–09, 2013, 2015–2018), and has crowned 24 different champions. The 11th hole at Glen Abbey is widely considered its signature hole, and begins the world-famous valley sequence of five holes from 11 to 15. The picturesque 11th is a 459-yard straightaway par-4, where players tee off 100 feet above the fairway, which ends at Sixteen Mile Creek, just short of the green. John Daly left his mark, and a plaque is permanently displayed on the back tee deck, recounting Daly's attempt to reach the green with his tee shot. His ball landed in the creek.\nIn 2000, Tiger Woods dueled with Grant Waite over the final 18 holes, before finally subduing the New Zealander on the 72nd hole with an exceptional shot. Holding a one-shot advantage, Woods found his tee shot in a fairway bunker, and after watching Waite put his second shot 30 feet from the hole, decided to go for the green. Woods hit a 6-iron which carried a lake and settled on the fringe just past the flag, which was 218 yards away, and then chipped to tap-in range for the title-clinching birdie. With the victory, Woods became only the second golfer to capture the U.S. Open, Open Championship and Canadian Open in the same year, earning him the Triple Crown trophy; he matched Lee Trevino (1971).\nIn 2009, Mark Calcavecchia scored nine consecutive birdies at the second round, breaking the PGA Tour record.\nCanadian performances.\nUntil 2023, a Canadian citizen had not won the Canadian Open since Pat Fletcher in 1954, and since 1914 for a player born in Canada. One of the most exciting conclusions ever seen at the Open came in 2004, extending that streak. Mike Weir had never done well at the Glen Abbey Golf Course, the site of the tournament that week. In fact, he had only made the cut once at any of the Opens contested at Glen Abbey. But Weir clawed his way to the top of the leaderboard by Friday. And by the third day at the 100th anniversary Open, he had a three-stroke lead, and many Canadians were buzzing about the possibility of the streak's end. Weir started off with a double bogey, but then went 4-under to keep his 3-stroke lead, with only eight holes left. Yet, with the expectations of Canadian observers abnormally high, there was another roadblock in the way of Mike Weir: Vijay Singh. Weir bogeyed three holes on the back nine but still had a chance to win the tournament with a 10-footer on the 72nd hole. When he missed the putt, the two entered a sudden-death playoff. Weir missed two more chances to win the tournament: a 25-foot putt for eagle on No. 18 on the first hole of sudden-death, and a 5-foot putt on No. 17, the second playoff hole. On the third playoff hole, Weir put his third shot into the water after a horrid drive and lay-up, and Singh was safely on the green in two. Singh won the Open and overtook Tiger Woods as the world's number one player.\nCanadian David Hearn took a two-shot lead into the final round in 2015. He still had the lead as late as the 15th hole, but was being closely pursued by three players ranked near the top of the Official World Golf Ranking – Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk, and Jason Day. All four golfers had chances to win right until the end. Hearn was overtaken by champion Day's three consecutive birdies to close the round; Day finished one shot ahead of Watson, who also birdied the final three holes, narrowly missing an eagle attempt on a final hole greenside chip that would have tied. Day's fourth career Tour triumph came after he had just missed a potential tying putt on the final hole at the Open Championship the previous week. Hearn finished third, the best result by a Canadian since Weir's near-miss in 2004. In 2016, Canadian amateur Jared du Toit was only one stroke behind going into the final round, allowing him to play in the final group. He finished tied for ninth, three strokes behind eventual winner Jhonattan Vegas.\nIn 2023, Canadian Nick Taylor finally broke the drought for the home country, dating back 69 years to 1954, winning in dramatic fashion at the Oakdale Golf &amp; Country Club. He birdied the final hole to tie Englishman Tommy Fleetwood (who made par) at 17 under par after 72 holes. On the fourth sudden death hole, Taylor made a eagle to capture the title.\nWinners.\nNote: Green highlight indicates scoring records.\nSource\nMultiple and consecutive champions.\nThis table lists the golfers who have won more than one Canadian Open.\nChampions by nationality.\nThis table lists the total number of titles won by golfers of each nationality.\nTrophies.\nThe first trophy presented to the winner was donated by the Rivermead Golf Club who hosted the event in 1920.

        "title": "1998 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1998 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1997–98 season, and the culmination of the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested by the Western Conference champion and defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings and the Eastern Conference champion Washington Capitals. It was the 105th year of the Stanley Cup being contested. The series was the Capitals' first appearance in a Stanley Cup Finals since the franchise's inception in 1974. The Red Wings won the series for the second year in a row, four games to none, to capture their ninth Stanley Cup in team history. This was the fourth consecutive Stanley Cup Finals that concluded with a sweep, as well as the most recent time it has happened. Detroit coach Scotty Bowman won his eighth Stanley Cup in that capacity (having previously done so with the Montreal Canadiens in , , , , and , the Pittsburgh Penguins in , and the Wings the previous year), tying him with former Canadiens coach Toe Blake for the record of most Cups won by a coach (which he would break when he helped the Red Wings win the 2002 Cup).\nMotivation to win a second straight title.\nJust six days after sweeping the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1997 Finals, Red Wings defenceman Vladimir Konstantinov and masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov sustained serious brain injuries when the limousine in which they were riding crashed. Viacheslav Fetisov was also in the limousine but was not seriously injured. The Red Wings subsequently dedicated their 1997–98 season to the two injured members and wore a patch on their jerseys bearing the players' initials. When the Red Wings were presented with the Stanley Cup, they wheeled Konstantinov onto the ice and placed the Cup in his lap. They also took him for a victory lap around the rink.\nPaths to the Finals.\nDetroit advanced to the Finals by defeating the Phoenix Coyotes, St. Louis Blues, and Dallas Stars in six games each.\nWashington defeated the Boston Bruins 4–2, the Ottawa Senators 4–1, and the Buffalo Sabres 4–2.\nGame summaries.\nIn this series, Capitals head coach Ron Wilson became the first person to head coach in both an Olympics and a Stanley Cup Finals in the same year, having coached team USA at the Nagano Olympics. Peter Laviolette would join him in this feat in while with the Carolina Hurricanes during their championship season, having coached the American ice hockey team during the Torino Olympics.\nGame one.\nAt home, Detroit took an early lead in the first period and scored two goals within two minutes and 14 seconds of each other. The Red Wings were able to hold off a Washington assault and take the first game of the series with a score of 2–1.\nGame two.\nIt looked as if the Capitals were to tie the series with a 4–2 lead in the third period, but after a Detroit goal to make it 4–3, Capitals forward Esa Tikkanen had a\nscoring opportunity midway through the third period that would have likely put Detroit away before the venue changed back to Washington's MCI Center, and also would have changed the entire dynamic of the series, but he missed the open net shot. Detroit then rallied late in the third period to tie the game and send it into overtime. Kris Draper scored with four minutes left in the first overtime to give the Red Wings a 5–4 victory and a 2–0 lead in the series.\nGame three.\nDetroit scored in the first 35 seconds to take an early lead which held up until the third period. The Capitals tied the game midway through the third period, but Sergei Fedorov scored to give the Wings a three games to none lead in the series.\nGame four.\nIn game four, Detroit was dominant throughout to win the game by a score of 4–1 and sweep the series. Steve Yzerman was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. When the Cup was awarded, Vladimir Konstantinov was brought onto the ice in his wheelchair and joined the celebration with his team.\nTeam rosters.\nBolded years under Finals appearance indicates year won Stanley Cup.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1998 Stanley Cup was presented to Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Red Wings 4–1 win over the Capitals in game four\nThe following Red Wings players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1997–98 Detroit Red Wings\nStanley Cup engravings.\nIncluded on the team picture, but left off the Stanley Cup\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised on CBC. In the United States, Fox broadcast game one while ESPN televised games two through four. Had the series extended, games five and seven would have been broadcast on Fox, and ESPN would have aired game six.\nAftermath.\nThe following season, the Red Wings would reach the Western Conference Semifinals, only to be ousted by the Colorado Avalanche in six games. The Red Wings would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until four years later, when they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes in five games. The Washington Capitals, however, missed the playoffs the following year. The Capitals would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until 20 years later, when they would win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history after defeating the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in five games."

        "title": "Royal Liverpool Golf Club",
        "text": "The Royal Liverpool Golf Club is a golf club in Wirral in Merseyside, England. It was founded in 1869 on what was then the racecourse of the Liverpool Hunt Club. It received the \"Royal\" designation in 1871 due to the patronage of Prince Arthur the Duke of Connaught, one of Queen Victoria's younger sons. Robert Chambers and George Morris (younger brother of Old Tom Morris) were commissioned to lay out the original course, which was extended to 18 holes in 1871. Harry Colt, one of the world's leading golf course architects, redesigned the course early in the 20th century, and it has since been tweaked periodically, mainly as a response to advances in equipment.\nThe Open Championship has been played 13 times at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, most recently in 2023.\nLocation.\nRoyal Liverpool Golf Club is located in the small town of Hoylake, at the northwest corner of the Wirral Peninsula. The golf course extends between Hoylake and the neighbouring town of West Kirby, to the southwest. It has a single 18-hole course, which is a seaside links.\nHistory.\nRoyal Liverpool was the inaugural men's amateur championship host in 1885, which became The Amateur Championship. It was host to the first ever international match between Scotland and England in 1902. It hosted the first Home International matches between Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the United States in 1921, an event which became the Walker Cup. In fact, it is Royal Liverpool Golf Club's contribution to the amateur game that has set it apart from all other clubs in England. Although, at the end of the nineteenth century, it was the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews that took on the role of the governing body in golf as the game developed, it was at Royal Liverpool that the rules of amateur status were laid down. The Open at Royal Liverpool was also the scene of the second leg of Bobby Jones' historic Grand Slam in 1930.\nSuperstar champions Ball and Hilton.\nThe history of Royal Liverpool would not be complete without mention of two of the club's most famous sons, Harold Hilton and John Ball. Between them they dominated the amateur game of their era, and the pair were also a major influence on the professional game, each of them winning the Open Championship as amateurs. Ball won the Amateur Championship eight times between 1888 and 1912, and was runner-up twice. The venerable Ball competed in the Amateur Championship as late as 1921 when Royal Liverpool hosted the event. He won the Open Championship in 1890, the first Englishman and the first amateur to do so, and also took the Amateur title the same year.\nHarold Hilton's record was just as impressive. He won the Open twice, in 1892 (the first year the Open was played over 72 holes) and again five years later, making him the only amateur apart from John Ball and Bobby Jones to win the title. His victory at Hoylake in 1897 was marked 100 years later by the creation of a new, annual Harold Hilton Medal tournament open to amateur golfers aged 30 or more and handicap five or less. Hilton also won the Amateur Championship four times, was runner-up on three occasions, and won the U.S. Amateur Championship in 1911, the year in which he also held the British title. This feat made him the first to hold both major amateur titles simultaneously. In the same year he still found time to become the first editor of the new \"Golf Monthly\" magazine.\nCharacter of the course.\nMany comments have been made over the years about the quality and toughness of the links. The wind's absence was conspicuous during the benign Open week in 2006. However, such was winner Tiger Woods' respect for the need for strategic play that he only hit his driver once during the tournament, with the course baked out due to dry conditions, and playing very fast. The course is mostly level, but the holes nearest the coast run through sandhills. The course underwent a variety of changes in advance of the 2023 Open Championship, including a new par-3 that will play as the 17th hole during The Open.\nImportant events.\nImportant tournaments staged at Royal Liverpool include:\nThe course has also hosted a number of professional tournaments on the European Tour and before its foundation in 1972. Royal Liverpool has been the site for many tournaments for ladies, seniors, and boys, and various regional and representative events. It hosted The Open Championship for the first time in 39 years in 2006; Tiger Woods won his third Open Championship, two strokes ahead of runner-up Chris DiMarco. It was an emotional victory for Woods, who had lost his father to prostate cancer just two months earlier.\nRoyal Liverpool hosted the 2010 English Men's Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship for the Brabazon Trophy; the event was won by Darren Wright. The links had earlier staged the Brabazon on four occasions. In 1961, Ronnie Shade was champion, followed in 1972 by Peter Moody, a former University of Cambridge captain. Sandy Lyle lifted the trophy in 1977, while the 1989 event saw a tie between Craig Rivett from South Africa and Neil Roderick from Wales.\nRoyal Liverpool hosted the Women's British Open for the first time in 2012. The championship was won by South Korea's Jiyai Shin, who set a new record for the largest winning margin in the event (9 strokes) and a new women's course record of 64 in her second round.\nThe Open Championship.\nThe thirteen winners of The Open Championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club:\nRecent scorecard.\nSource:"

He formerly served as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, Washington Wizards, and Sacramento Kings in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was also head coach for three seasons at Rutgers University.\nBasketball career.\nCollege career.\nJordan attended Rutgers University from 1973 to 1977. He was enrolled as a physical education student, but failed to graduate. Jordan helped lead the school to the 1976 NCAA Final Four, during which he was named East Regional MVP. At Rutgers, Jordan acquired the nickname \"Fast Eddie.\" In his senior season, Jordan was named honorable mention All-America, while setting Rutgers' all-time career records in assists (585) and steals (220).\nNBA career.\nEarly NBA career.\nJordan was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round of the 1977 NBA draft (33rd overall), and was acquired by the New Jersey Nets halfway through his rookie season. Jordan tied Norm Nixon (Los Angeles Lakers) for the lead in total steals with 201 in 1978–1979, and was second in total steals, 223, in 1979–80 (behind the New York Knicks' Micheal Ray Richardson with 265).\nLater NBA career.\nJordan played for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 1980–81 season, and was a member of the 1982 NBA World Championship team. He played for the Lakers for four years and then played briefly with the Portland Trail Blazers. Jordan retired from the NBA after the 1983–84 season. Over his seven-year NBA career, Jordan averaged 8.1 points, 3.8 assists and 1.82 steals per game.\nCoaching career.\nNCAA.\nAfter retiring from the NBA in 1984, Jordan was a volunteer assistant at Rutgers University under his former college head coach, and his eventual Wizards' assistant, Tom Young. Jordan followed Young to Old Dominion University as a part-time assistant as before and subsequently obtained an assistant coaching position at Boston College under Jim O'Brien in 1986. He also became an assistant coach at Rutgers in 1988.\nNBA.\nKings.\nIn 1992, Jordan became an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings, and remained an assistant for five seasons.

Jordan was fired after the 1997–98 season.\nNets.\nJordan joined the New Jersey Nets coaching staff on March 17, 1999, and served as the lead assistant for four seasons. While in New Jersey, Jordan helped guide the squad to consecutive Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference Championships in 2002 and 2003.\nWizards.\n2003–06.\nLater that year, Jordan signed a four-year contract worth a little more than $3 million per year with the Washington Wizards and was introduced as head coach of the team on June 19, 2003.\nWashington finished with a 25–57 record during Jordan's inaugural season as head coach. The following year, Jordan helped guide the Wizards to a 20-game improvement in 2004–05. Only the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns experienced a greater improvement in total wins from the previous year.\nOn April 11, 2005, Jordan won his 100th career game as a head coach, and improved his career record to 103–158. During the 2004–05 regular season, Jordan's second with the Wizards, he led the team to a 45–37 record, which was the franchise's best season since 1978–79. The record established a new record for wins in a season at Verizon Center, earned the team a five seed in the Eastern Conference, and was the Wizards' first playoff berth since the 1996–97 season. The Wizards played the fourth seeded Chicago Bulls and won the series four games to two. The team rallied from a 0–2 deficit to win the series with four consecutive wins. It was the team's first postseason series win since 1982.\n2006–07.\nIn the 2006–07 season, Jordan guided the Wizards to a third straight playoff berth for the first time since 1988. Jordan won the Coach of the Month award for December, guiding Washington to a 12–4 record during that month. Jordan coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars at the NBA All-Star Game on February 18 in Las Vegas, the first coach from the franchise since Dick Motta in 1978–79.\n2007–08.\nIn the 2007–08 season Jordan led the Wizards to a fourth straight playoff berth despite beginning the year 0–5. The Wizards were eliminated in the first round by the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight year.\nJordan was fired as head coach of the Washington Wizards on November 24, 2008, after a 1–10 start. At the time of his firing Jordan was the longest tenured coach in the Eastern Conference and as their coach he guided the Wizards to four straight playoff appearances, advancing only once. He compiled a regular season record of 197–224. The 197 victories rank third all-time in franchise history.\nSixers.\n2009–2010.\nJordan was officially introduced as the head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers on June 1, 2009.\nOn Thursday, April 15, Jordan was fired by the 76ers after one season. Later that month, it was reported that Jordan had been one of the leading candidates for the head coaching vacancy at his alma mater, Rutgers, but had pulled out of the running to continue to seek a new coaching job in the NBA.\nLakers.\nIn 2012, Jordan was hired as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers. Jordan was brought in primarily to assist head coach Mike Brown in installing the Princeton offense.\nRutgers.\nOn April 18, 2013, it was reported that Rutgers would name Jordan head coach, replacing fired head coach Mike Rice. On April 23, 2013, Rutgers officially announced the hiring of Eddie Jordan as the 18th head coach of the men's basketball program.\nIn three years as coach of the Scarlet Knights, which included their transition from the American Athletic Conference to the Big Ten Conference, Jordan finished each season with twenty or more losses and the 2015–16 season was the worst of the three. Rutgers finished with twenty-five losses, sixteen of which were in conference; a victory against Minnesota in their final regular season game prevented the Scarlet Knights from finishing winless in Big Ten play and broke a thirty-two game conference losing streak. Jordan's final game was on March 9, 2016, as the Scarlet Knights lost to Nebraska in the opening round of the Big Ten tournament; Rutgers announced his firing the next day. His overall record was 29–68, with an 8–46 record on conference play."

        "text": "Swimming to Cambodia, also known as Spalding Gray's Swimming to Cambodia, is a 1987 American concert film written by and starring Spalding Gray, and directed by Jonathan Demme. The performance film is of Gray's play and monologue, which centered on such themes as his trip to Southeast Asia to create the role of the U.S. Ambassador's aide in the film \"The Killing Fields\", the Cold War, Cambodia Year Zero, and his search for his \"perfect moment\". It was nominated for Best Feature, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay at the 1988 Independent Spirit Awards.\nBackground.\nOver a period of two years, Gray originally developed \"Swimming to Cambodia\" as a theatre performance piece. The original running time of the performance was four hours, and it was presented over two nights. Gray received a Special Citation for this work at the 1985 Obie Awards.\nIn 2001, Gray revived \"Swimming to Cambodia,\" performing it on stage in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Albany, New York.\nContent.\nThe opening shots of the film show Gray walking toward The Performing Garage in New York City. He enters, and after passing the audience, takes a seat behind a table. On the table are a glass of water, a microphone, and a notebook, the latter brought by Gray. Behind him are two pull-down maps. One is a map of Southeast Asia and the other is a diagram of the bombing of Cambodia, which Gray tells the viewers/audience was called Operation Breakfast. There is also a back-lit projection screen showing a photograph of a beach.\nGray's monologue describes his experiences filming a small role in the film \"The Killing Fields\", and the then-recent history of Cambodia up through the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide. Three scenes from \"The Killing Fields\" that feature Gray are shown at various points in the film.\nProduction.\nThe soundtrack for the film was composed and performed by Laurie Anderson, who would also score Gray's follow-up film, \"Monster in a Box.\" Gray returned the favor by providing the voice of a TV interviewer for her 1986 short film, \"What You Mean We?.\" No soundtrack album was released; Anderson later reused music from the film for a series of \"Personal Service Announcements\" which she produced in 1989 to promote her album, \"Strange Angels.\"\nWhile Sam Waterston and Ira Wheeler are credited as cast in this film, they appear only in clips used from \"The Killing Fields.\"\nHome media.\nShout! Factory announced plans for a DVD release of \"Swimming to Cambodia\" on May 28, 2013.\n\"Swimming to Cambodia\" was released in the UK on region 2 DVD on March 16, 2015, by Simply Media."

        "text": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Leicestershire. It has also been representative of the county of Rutland. The club's limited overs team is called the Leicestershire Foxes. Founded in 1879, the club had minor county status until 1894, when it was promoted to first-class status pending its entry into the County Championship in 1895. Since then, Leicestershire have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England.\nThe club is based at Grace Road, Leicester, known as Uptonsteel County Ground. and have also played home games at Aylestone Road in Leicester, at Hinckley, Loughborough, Melton Mowbray, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Coalville, Uppingham and Oakham inside the traditional county boundaries.\nIn limited overs cricket, the kit colours are red with black trim in the Royal London One Day Cup and black with red trim in the T20. The shirt sponsors are Oval Insurance Broking with Highcross Leicester (shopping centre) on the top reverse side of the shirt.\nLeicestershire are in the second division of the County Championship and in the north group of the Royal London One Day Cup. They recently finished bottom of the County Championship for the sixth time since the introduction of two divisions. Their best showing in recent years has been in the Twenty20 Cup with the Foxes winning the trophy three times in eight years.\nHonours.\nSecond XI honours.\n+ 1 Bain Hogg Trophy – second XI one-day competition – 1996\nHistory.\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket may not have reached Leicestershire until well into the 18th century. A notice in the \"Leicester Journal\" dated 17 August 1776 is the earliest known mention of cricket in the county. Soon afterwards, a Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket Club was taking part in important matches, mainly against Nottingham Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). This club was prominent from 1781 until the beginning of the 19th century.\n19th century.\nLittle more is heard of Leicestershire cricket until the formation of the present club on 25 March 1879.\nEssex CCC \"versus\" Leicestershire CCC at Leyton on 14, 15 &amp; 16 May 1894 was the first first-class match for both clubs. In 1895, the County Championship was restructured into a 14-team competition with the introduction of Essex, Leicestershire and Warwickshire CCC.\nEarly and mid-20th century.\nLeicestershire's first 70 years were largely spent in lower table mediocrity, with few notable exceptions. In 1953, the motivation of secretary-captain Charles Palmer lifted the side fleetingly to third place, but most of the rest of the 1950s was spent propping up the table, or thereabouts.\nStart of improvement: The late 1950s and the 1960s.\nChange came in the late 1950s with the recruitment of the charismatic Willie Watson at the end of a distinguished career with England and Yorkshire. Watson's run gathering sparked the home-grown Maurice Hallam into becoming one of England's best opening batsmen. In bowling, Leicestershire had an erratically successful group of seamers in Terry Spencer, Brian Boshier, John Cotton and Jack van Geloven, plus the spin of John Savage.\nAnother change was in the captaincy: Tony Lock, the former England and Surrey spinner who had galvanised Western Australia.\nThe 1970s and the first golden era.\nRay Illingworth, again from Yorkshire, instilled self-belief to the extent that the county took its first ever trophy in 1972, the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup with Chris Balderstone man of the match. This was start of the first golden era as the first of five trophies in five years and included Leicestershire's first ever County Championship title in 1975. A couple of runners up spots were also thrown in.\nThe game when Leicestershire won their first ever County Championship, on 15 September 1975, marked something of a personal triumph for Chris Balderstone. Batting on 51 not out against Derbyshire at Chesterfield, after close of play he changed into his football kit to play for Doncaster Rovers in an evening match 30 miles away (a 1–1 draw with Brentford). Thus he is the only player to have played League Football and first class cricket on the same day. He then returned to Chesterfield to complete a century the following morning and take three wickets to wrap up the title. To add to that season's success for Leicestershire was a second Benson &amp; Hedges victory.\nThe 1980s.\nA runners up spot in the 1982 County Championship brought some respectability, but the decade's only silverware was in the 1985 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup with Balderstone still on board making him the most successful trophy winner in the club's history with six.\nSuccess in the late 1990s.\nLeicestershire won the county championship in 1996, and again in 1998. This was an amazing achievement considering the resources of the club compared to other county teams. This Leicestershire side, led by Jack Birkenshaw and James Whitaker, used team spirit and togetherness to get the best out of a group of players who were either discarded from other counties or brought through the Leicestershire ranks.\nThis team did not have many stars, but Aftab Habib, Darren Maddy, Vince Wells, Jimmy Ormond, Alan Mullally and Chris Lewis all had chances for England. West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons was also named as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the year in 1997 while playing for the club.\n2000 and beyond: Twenty20 success and four-day struggles.\nThe advent of Twenty20 cricket saw Leicestershire find a new source of success, winning the domestic T20 competition in 2004, 2006 and 2011. However, in the era of two-division County Championship cricket they have found success more difficult to come by, having not played in the top division since 2003 and been regular \"wooden spoon\" contenders. In 2013 and 2014 they finished without a single Championship win, the first team to achieve this unwanted feat in back to back seasons since Northamptonshire just before World War II.\nInternational players.\nEngland \nAustralia\nBangladesh \nIndia\nNew Zealand\nPakistan\nSouth Africa\nWest Indies\nZimbabwe\nRecords.\nMost first-class runs for Leicestershire \nQualification – 17,000 runs\nMost first-class wickets for Leicestershire \nQualification – 600 wickets\nMost first-team winners medals for Leicestershire\nBatting.\nBest partnership for each wicket (county championship)\nSub Academy.\nThe Leicestershire Sub Academy is designed for young cricketers who have potential to play at the highest level. It is also called the EPP (Emerging Player Programme). Many players who are involved in this set up move on to the LCCC academy, where they will play matches against academies from other counties."

They have won the English County Championship competition in 1948, 1969 and 1997. Glamorgan have also beaten international teams from all of the Test playing nations, including Australia whom they defeated in successive tours in 1964 and 1968. The club's limited overs team is called simply Glamorgan. Kit colours are blue and yellow for limited overs matches.\nThe club is based in Cardiff and plays most of its home games at Sophia Gardens, which is located on the bank of the River Taff. Matches have also occasionally been played at Swansea, Colwyn Bay and Cresselly (despite the latter towns being in Denbighshire and Pembrokeshire respectively).\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket probably reached Wales and Glamorgan by the end of the 17th century. The earliest known reference to cricket in Glamorgan is a match at Swansea in 1780.\nOrigin of club.\nThe formation of Glamorgan CCC took place on 6 July 1888 at a meeting in the Angel Hotel, Cardiff.\nThe club competed in the Minor Counties Championship for many years and then applied for first-class status after the First World War.\nGlamorgan CCC played its initial first-class match \"versus\" Sussex CCC at Cardiff Arms Park on 18–20 May 1921 and thus increased the County Championship to 17 teams. Captained by N.V.H. Riches, Glamorgan won this first match by 23 runs. Only one more victory was achieved that summer; Glamorgan lost 14 games and finished with the wooden spoon.\nClub history.\nGlamorgan won the county championship in 1948 under the captaincy of Wilf Wooller, whose advocacy of high fielding standards was the key to beating stronger batting and bowling teams.\nGlamorgan was the unintentional venue for a piece of cricket history on 31 August 1968 when, during Glamorgan v Notts at Swansea, Gary Sobers hit all six balls in an over from Malcolm Nash for six.\nGlamorgan won the championship again under Tony Lewis in 1969 and Matthew Maynard in 1997. Lewis is the only Glamorgan player to captain England in Tests, when he became the first Glamorgan cricketer to lead an England tour abroad to play series against India and Pakistan in 1972–73. Maynard, who retired at the end of the 2005 season, was one of the most successful batsmen in first class cricket over the previous 20 years. The 2005 captain, off spinner Robert Croft, proved effective on England tours, and was a useful pinch hitter in List A one-day games.\nThe club had plans in April 2006 to extend its grounds in the Grade 2 Listed Heritage Park that is Sophia Gardens, with a 17,500 seat super-stadium.\nSophia Gardens became a Test cricket venue in 2009 when the First Test in the Ashes series against Australia was held there.\nRecords.\nMost first-class runs for Glamorgan\nQualification – 16,000 runs\nMost first-class wickets for Glamorgan\nQualification – 800 wickets\nTeam totals\nBatting\nBest partnership for each wicket\nBowling"

        "title": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club",
        "text": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Gloucestershire. Founded in 1870, Gloucestershire has always been first-class and has played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. The club played its first senior match in 1870 and W. G. Grace was their captain. The club plays home games at the Bristol County Ground in the Bishopston area of north Bristol. A number of games are also played at the Cheltenham Cricket Festival at the College Ground, Cheltenham and matches have also been played at the Gloucester cricket festival at The King's School, Gloucester.\nGloucestershire's most famous players have been W. G. Grace, whose father founded the club, and Wally Hammond, who scored 113 centuries for them. The club has had two notable periods of success: in the 1870s when it was unofficially acclaimed as the Champion County on at least three occasions, and from 1999 to 2006 when it won seven limited overs trophies, notably a 'double double' in 1999 and 2000 (both the Benson and Hedges Cup and the C&amp;G Trophy in both seasons), and the Sunday League in 2000.\nEarliest cricket.\nCricket probably reached Gloucestershire by the end of the 17th century. It is known that the related sport of \"Stow-Ball\" \"aka\" \"Stob-Ball\" was played in the county during the 16th century. In this game, the bat was called a \"stave\". See Alice Gomme: \"The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland\".\nA game in Gloucester on 22 September 1729 is the earliest definite reference to cricket in the county. From then until the founding of the county club, very little has been found outside parish cricket.\nOrigin of club.\nIn the early 1840s, Dr Henry Grace and his brother-in-law Alfred Pocock founded the Mangotsfield Cricket Club which merged in 1846 with the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club, whose name was adopted until 1867, after which it became the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. Grace hoped that Gloucestershire would join the first-class county clubs but the situation was complicated in 1863 by the formation of a rival club called the Cheltenham and Gloucestershire Cricket Club.\nDr Grace's club played Gloucestershire's initial first-class match \"versus\" Surrey at Durdham Down in Bristol on 2, 3 &amp; 4 June 1870. Gloucestershire joined the (unofficial) County Championship at this time but the existence of the Cheltenham club seems to have forestalled the installation of its \"constitutional trappings\". The Cheltenham club was wound up in March 1871 and its chief officials accepted positions in the hierarchy of Gloucestershire. So, although the exact details and dates of the county club's foundation are uncertain, it has always been assumed that the year was 1870 and the club celebrated its centenary in 1970.\nWhat is certain is that Dr Grace was able to form the county club because of its playing strength, especially his three sons W. G., E. M. and Fred.\nClub history.\nThe early history of Gloucestershire is dominated by the Grace family, most notably W. G. Grace, who was the club's original captain and held that post until his departure for London in 1899. His brother E. M. Grace, although still an active player, was the original club secretary. With the Grace brothers and Billy Midwinter in their team, Gloucestershire won three Champion County titles in the 1870s.\nSince then Gloucestershire's fortunes have been mixed and they have never won the official County Championship. They struggled in the pre-war years of the County Championship because their best batsmen, apart from Gilbert Jessop and briefly Charlie Townsend, were very rarely available. The bowling, except when Townsend did sensational things on sticky wickets in late 1895 and late 1898, was very weak until George Dennett emerged – then it had the fault of depending far too much on him. Wally Hammond, who still holds many of the county's batting records formed part of an occasionally strong inter-war team, although the highest championship finish during this period was second in 1930 and 1931, when Charlie Parker and Tom Goddard formed a devastating spin attack.\nOutstanding players since the war include Tom Graveney, \"Jack\" Russell and overseas players Mike Procter, Zaheer Abbas and Courtney Walsh.\nDominance in one-day cricket (1999–2004).\nGloucestershire was very successful in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater than the sum of its parts, boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.\nThe club's run of success started by defeating Yorkshire to win the Benson &amp; Hedges Super Cup in 1999 before then beating neighbours Somerset in the 1999 NatWest Trophy final at Lord's. In 2000 Gloucestershire completed a hat-trick of one-day titles, winning all the domestic limited overs tournaments, the Benson and Hedges Cup, the C&amp;G Trophy and the Sunday League in the same season. The club maintained its success winning the C&amp;G Trophy in 2003 and 2004, beating Worcestershire in the final on both occasions.\nRecent years (2006–present).\nThe club's captain for the 2006 season, Jon Lewis, became the first Gloucestershire player for nearly 10 years to play for England at Test match level, when he was picked to represent his country in the Third Test against Sri Lanka at Trent Bridge in June 2006. His figures in the first innings were 3–68, including a wicket in his very first over in Test cricket, and he was widely praised for his debut performance.\nFollowing the retirement of several key players, such as \"Jack\" Russell and Mark Alleyne, Gloucestershire's fortunes declined. The club subsequently stripped back its playing budget as it looked to finance the redevelopment of the Bristol County Ground in order to maintain Category B status and secure future international games at their home ground. Performances suffered and despite reaching the final of the 2007 Twenty20 Cup, losing narrowly to Kent, the club failed to win any major trophies for a decade.\nIn 2013 Gloucestershire stopped using 'Gloucestershire Gladiators' as its limited-overs name.\nGloucestershire won their first major silverware for 11 years in 2015, overcoming favoured Surrey to win the Royal London One-Day Cup in the final at Lord's. Captain Michael Klinger, who flew back from Australia to play in the semi-final win over Yorkshire, was named the tournament's MVP scoring 531 runs at an average of over 106.\nRivalries.\nGloucestershire contest one of English cricket's fiercest rivalries, the West Country derby against Somerset, which usually draws the biggest crowd of the season for either team. Traditionally, the boundary between the counties is drawn by the River Avon. Although Gloucestershire CCC's home ground is in Bristol, which straddles the Avon (and has been a county in its own right since 1373), many people from south Bristol favour Somerset CCC despite the fact the club plays its home games much further away in Taunton. However, in the past Somerset have played first-class matches at venues in the south of Bristol.\nGrounds.\nThe club's debut home match in first-class cricket was played at Durdham Down in the Clifton district of Bristol. This was the only time the county used this venue for a match. The following year Gloucestershire began to play matches at the Clifton College Close Ground in the grounds of Clifton College in the same part of the city, and this remained a regular venue for the county until the 1930s, hosting nearly 100 first-class matches. In 1872 the county used a venue outside Bristol for the first time when they played at the College Ground in the grounds of Cheltenham College. This venue has continued to be used regularly for the county's annual \"Cheltenham festival\" event, which in the modern era incorporates additional charity events and off-field entertainment. In 1889 Gloucestershire began to play matches at the Bristol County Ground in Bristol, which has subsequently served as the club's main headquarters and hosted the majority of the county's matches. It was here that the club played its first List A match in 1963 against Middlesex, and its first Twenty20 match forty years later against Worcestershire. Somerset have played first-class matches at other venues in the city.\nIn the 1920s Gloucestershire ceased playing at the Spa Ground in Gloucester, which had been in use since 1882, and switched to the Wagon Works Ground in the city. This ground remained in use for nearly 70 years, hosting over 150 first-class matches, before its use was discontinued in 1992. In 2012 the club investigated the possibility of returning to the Wagon Works Ground and making it their permanent headquarters after being refused permission for extensive redevelopment of the County Ground in Bristol, but ultimately this did not occur. In 1993, the club moved its base in Gloucester to Archdeacon Meadow, a ground owned by The King's School. This venue was only used for first-class matches until 2008 but was used for four Twenty20 matches in 2010 and 2011, the most recent county games to take place in the city. All subsequent matches have taken place in either Bristol or Cheltenham.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nSource: Cricinfo\nInternational players.\nAmong the international players who have represented Gloucestershire are:\nRecords.\nMost first-class runs for Gloucestershire &lt;br&gt;\nQualification – 20,000 runs \nMost first-class wickets for Gloucestershire &lt;br&gt;\nQualification – 1,000 wickets \nTeam totals\nBatting\nBest partnership for each wicket\nBowling\nShirt sponsors.\nOne-day / T20 cricket"

        "text": "Jeffrey Douglas Foster (born January 16, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player who spent the entirety of his 13-year career with the Indiana Pacers of the NBA.\nEarly life and college.\nFoster was born in San Antonio, Texas and graduated from James Madison High School in San Antonio in 1995. In senior year, he joined the varsity basketball team in high school. He attended Southwest Texas State University and finished college nine credits short of a degree in finance. With the Southwest Texas State Bobcats, Foster averaged 12.8 points and 10.2 rebounds in his junior season and was part of the All-Southland Conference Second-Team in 1998.\nNBA career.\nHe was selected 21st overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 1999 NBA draft out of Southwest Texas State University, but his draft rights were immediately traded to the Pacers in exchange for Vonteego Cummings and a future first-round draft pick.\nFoster was part of the Pacers' 1999–2000 Eastern Conference championship team, though he played only 19 games that year as he was fourth on the Pacers' depth chart at center behind Rik Smits, Sam Perkins and Zan Tabak. In his second season, he played in 71 games, gaining a spot in the rotation as the Pacers rebuilt for the future. He averaged 3.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game while averaging only 16.2 minutes per contest.\nFoster began the 2001–02 season as the starter, and started 48 games that year before Brad Miller was acquired in a trade with the Chicago Bulls. Nevertheless, Foster played in all 82 games for the first time in his career, averaging 5.7 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.\nMiller remained the Pacers' starting center throughout the 2002–03 season, and as such Foster was relegated back to the bench, and he produced his lowest point total yet of his career (2.1 ppg) and grabbed only 3.6 rebounds per game.\nBefore the 2003–04 season, Brad Miller was traded to the Sacramento Kings, and newly acquired Scot Pollard began as the starting center. But Foster distinguished himself in the Pacers' season opener against the Detroit Pistons and his play, combined with Pollard's poor play, meant a return to the starting line-up for Foster. The energetic, hard-working center became an important rebounding presence for the Pacers, and his offensive rebounds, in particular, combined with well-timed tip-ins, finally endeared himself to Indiana fans.\nFoster sustained a back injury in December 2009 and underwent surgery on February 16, 2010.\nFoster announced his retirement on March 21, 2012. He cited chronic back issues as the reason for his departure from the game. At the time of his retirement, Foster ranked 8th all-time in total rebound rate and 4th all-time in offensive rebound rate."

        "text": "John Edwards (born July 31, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. He played the center position.\nEdwards played collegiately for Kent State University. While at Kent State, Edwards was part of two of the Golden Flashes trips to the NCAA tournament which included their appearance in the 2002 Elite Eight. He was named Mid-American Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a first-team all-conference pick in his final season and holds the Kent State record for season and career blocked shots.\nHe was invited to the Indiana Pacers training camp in 2004. Mainly due to his size, and some unexpected injuries to the Pacers big men early in the season, he was the only free agent training camp invitee to earn a spot on the main roster. Even so, he was expected to be released as soon as the Pacers got healthy, but the rash of suspensions resulting from the November 19, 2004 brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills enabled him to remain on the team. As a result of this and other injuries to the bench, the Pacers were only able to dress six players and Edwards constituted the team's entire bench.\nDuring the summer of 2005, Edwards signed with the Atlanta Hawks, and, during the 2005–06 NBA season, he averaged 8.6 minutes per game.\nOn August 22, 2006, Edwards was traded back to the Pacers, along with Al Harrington, in exchange for a 2007 first-round draft pick. He was waived in preseason, and split time with two NBDL teams in 2006–07. Edwards signed with the Albuquerque Thunderbirds in December 2006 then with the Tulsa 66ers the following month. The following season, also during preseason, Edwards was waived by the Minnesota Timberwolves, signing in November 2007 with Cherkassy.\nEdwards returned to the D-League when he signed with the Iowa Energy in March 2009. The Energy traded Edwards to the Bakersfield Jam in January 2010.\nHe played in the 2010–2011 season with the Greek League team Colossus Rhodes. He then played in Puerto Rico, before moving to Poland to play for Turów Zgorzelec. In 2012, he signed with BC Tsmoki-Minsk in Belarus. He retired from basketball in 2013 and is pursuing a career in Information Technology."

        "text": "The World Cup of Golf is a men's golf tournament contested by teams of two representing their country. Only one team is allowed from each country. The players are selected on the basis of the Official World Golf Ranking, although not all of the first choice players choose to compete. The equivalent event for women was the Women's World Cup of Golf, played from 2005 to 2008.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was founded by Canadian industrialist John Jay Hopkins, who hoped it would promote international goodwill through golf. It began in 1953 as the Canada Cup and changed its name to the World Cup in 1967. With Fred Corcoran as the Tournament Director and the International Golf Association behind it (1955–1977), the World Cup traveled the globe and grew to be one of golf's most prestigious tournaments throughout the 1960s and 1970s, but interest in the event faded to the point that the event was not held in 1981 or 1986.\nThe tournament was incorporated into the World Golf Championships series from 2000 to 2006. In 2007 it ceased to be a World Golf Championships event, but continued to be sanctioned by the International Federation of PGA Tours.\nFrom 2007 through 2009 the tournament was held at the Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, China, receiving the name Mission Hills World Cup. There was no tournament in 2010, it having been announced that the event would change from annual to biennial, held in odd-numbered years, to accommodate the 2016 inclusion of golf at the Olympics. The 2011 tournament was at a new venue — Mission Hills Haikou in the Chinese island province of Hainan.\nThe United States has a clear lead in wins, with 24 as of 2018.\nFormat.\nIn 1953, the format was 36 holes of stroke play with the combined score of the two-man team determining the winner. From 1954 to 1999, the format was 72 holes of stroke play. Beginning in 2000, the format became alternating stroke play rounds of bestball (fourball) and alternate shot (foursomes).\nThe 2013 tournament was primarily an individual event with a team component. The 60-player field was selected based on the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) with up to two players per country allowed to qualify (four per country if they are within the top 15 of the OWGR). The format returned to 72 holes of stroke play, with the individuals competing for US$7 million of the $8 million total purse. OWGR points were awarded for the first time. The top two-ranked players from each country competed for the team portion, using combined stroke play scores. The individual portion was similar to what would be used at the 2016 Summer Olympics, except that England, Scotland, and Wales had teams instead of a single Great Britain team as in the Olympics, while Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland again played as a single team.\nIn 2016, the format reverted to that used from 2000 to 2011.\nFrom 1955 to 1999, there was also a separate award, the International Trophy, for the individual with the best 72-hole score.\nTeam winners.\n1\"This was a combined Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland team. They competed under the Republic of Ireland flag although both golfers were from Northern Ireland.\""

The African Volleyball Commission had been founded in 1967.\nAlthough the national federation of Egypt was involved in the founding of the FIVB in 1947, the sport of volleyball remains essentially amateur in Africa, even in countries which maintain consistent Olympic programmes, such as South Africa or Kenya.

        "text": "Philip Thomas Davies (born 19 October 1963) is a Welsh former rugby union footballer of the 1980s and 1990s. He is now an international coach, currently serving as director of rugby at Leeds Tykes, whilst running his own sports consultancy company.\nPlaying career.\nDavies played his club rugby for Llanelli and enjoyed a distinguished 46 cap career for Wales between 1985 and 1995. It was during this period that Welsh packs became far less dominant than in the glory days of the 1970s and Davies, along with David Pickering and Bob Norster, was one of the few class forwards that his side could muster. Davies played 329 for Llanelli and scored 80 tries and 4 cons during his career.\nThe mustachioed Davies was a useful addition to the side mostly because of his offensive ability and the fact that he could play either as flanker, number eight or lock forward.\nHis career is also memorable for his involvement in the so-called \"Battle of Cardiff\" in 1987, an extremely violent clash between Wales and England that saw Davies punched by opposition lock Wade Dooley. Davies' first international appearance came in a 24–15 victory over England in Cardiff, a game that saw his brother-in-law, Jonathan Davies, also make his debut. England, who had not won in Cardiff since 1963, led the game 15–12, before fullback Chris Martin failed to take a high kick and Davies (Jonathan) scored a crucial try. Davies' next appearance came in a 40–3 victory against Fiji at the Arms Park, and he marked the occasion by scoring two of his side's seven tries.\nThe following year Davies played in seven tests in total, but was denied a possible Triple Crown when his side were beaten 21–18 by England in the first match of the campaign. Wales recovered to beat Scotland and Ireland before losing to France. Davies and his teammates then embarked on a short tour of the Southern Hemisphere as part of the side's preparation for the 1987 Rugby World Cup and included victories over Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. The games against Fiji and Samoa passed with relatively little incident, but the Tonga test was notable for its violence and both Davies and Adrian Hadley found themselves on the receiving end of opposition fists, not for the last time in Davies' case.\nHonours.\nWales\nLlanelli RFC\nCoaching career.\nLeeds (1996–2006).\nDavies was director of rugby at Leeds Tykes from 1996 to 2006 before resigning his post. When he first took charge in 1996 Leeds where in National Division Four, where in his debut season the club finished third, two places above the previous season. In 1998, they were promoted up to the Allied Dunbar Premiership Two finishing in sixth place, before finishing runner-up to Rotherham in 1999–2000. In 2001, Davies lead Leeds to the National Division One title, losing just two games all season. They were therefore promoted to the top elite tournament for the 2001–02 English Premiership season. Despite winning six games during the season, and performed well in the 2001–02 European Challenge Cup, they finished bottom of the table, but avoided relegation due to the inadequacies of Rotherham's ground. In the 2002–03 English Premiership season, Davies led Leeds to fifth with 12 victories, and the second round of the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup. In 2004 Leeds finished 11th, but did however secure seven victories to place them 34 points clear of relegated team Rotherham. In their debut season of the Heineken Cup, Leeds gained a single victory, a 29–20 win over Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Davies left his post at Leeds after they were relegated at the end of the 2005–06 English Premiership season. Davies said at the time: \"I have no immediate plans to go elsewhere, rather I just feel it's time to take a break. I want to make it clear this mutual decision has nothing to do with the current situation at Leeds. It is after much soul searching and discussion with my family and Leeds Tykes that I have decided to resign my post.\"\nDavies added: \"The last 10 years has been an amazing journey with a fantastic group of people, helping to take the club from National League Three to Heineken Cup rugby and winning the Powergen Cup last season. I will have some time out with my family and reflect upon my career and future, after a decade at this wonderful club.\"\nReturn to Wales (2006).\nIn August 2006, he returned to his former playing club, the Scarlets after being appointed Director of Rugby. In his first season in charge at the region, he guided the side to a fourth-placed finish in the 2006–07 Celtic League, while also leading the side to the semi-finals of the 2006–07 Heineken Cup, losing to Leicester Tigers 33–17. In 2007–08, the Scarlets struggled under Davies, losing all six games in the 2007–08 Heineken Cup, and dropping to sixth place in the 2007–08 Celtic League. In April 2008, it was announced that the Scarlets had sacked Davies, and that the 10 May clash with Edinburgh would be his last. After leaving Llanelli, he served as a consultant head coach with Cardiff RFC from November 2008 until May 2009. Where after he became National Academy Manager for the Welsh Rugby Union, where he was responsible for developing an international pathway at the WRU. This role doubled up with his duties as Wales U20's head coach which he was appointed as in September 2008.\nWales U20.\nHis first job as head coach was the 2009 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, where Wales finished fifth, just ahead of Italy, who was the only team that tournament Wales won against; 34–14. During the 2009 IRB Junior World Championship, Wales finished sixth after losing to France 68–13 in the 5th Place Final. In the 2010 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, Wales finished third, with victories over Scotland, 20–12, France, 43–8 and Italy, 25–6. In the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship, Wales finished second in their Pool, behind New Zealand, and after losing to hosts Argentina on penalty shootout, Wales finished seventh with a win over Fiji, 39–15.\n2010–2015.\nIn 2010, Davies joined recently relegated side Worcester Warriors as forwards coach. He helped return Worcester back to the Premiership after they won the 2010–11 RFU Championship with just one loss all season. His work with the forwards saw Worcester stay afloat in the Premiership, finishing tenth in the 2011–12 English Premiership.\nIn May 2012 Davies joined Cardiff Blues as Director of Rugby. His first competitive match in charge was a 13–9 win over Connacht on 1 September 2012. Between 22 September and 25 November, the Blues suffered six consecutive losses, before winning just their fourth game of the season against Zebre 14–7. On 19 January 2013, Davies earned his first Heineken Cup win, after beating Sale Sharks 26–14 in the final pool round of the 2012–13 season. At the end of the 2012–13 Pro12, Davies had led Cardiff Blues to ninth on the table, their lowest ever position since the 2004–05 Celtic League. During the 2013–14 Pro12, the Blues finished seventh in the table with 8 victories, however 4 of those victories came after Davies resigned mid-season, leaving the club on 3 March 2014 after his side's recent run of poor results. However, during the 2013–14 Heineken Cup, Davies did lead the side to a 19–15 win over reigning champions Toulon on 19 October 2013, before winning back-to-back against Glasgow Warriors 29–20 and 9–7. A final pool round loss to Exeter Chiefs, 19–13, meant the Blues narrowly missed the quarter-finals of the 2013–14 European Challenge Cup.\nAfter Namibia's 2014 end-of-year tour, Davies was appointed as interim head coach for North Wales region RGC 1404. Haven lead the side for the remainder of the 2014-15 Welsh Championship season, alongside his Namibian duties as technical adviser, Davies remained with the side for the full 2015-16 Welsh Championship season, missing the first part of the season due to his commitments with the Namibian national side. He helped see RGC promoted up to the Principality Premiership for their first ever time, before standing down as head coach at the end of that season to concentrate on his duties with Namibia.\nNamibia (2014–2019).\nAfter leaving Cardiff in March 2014, it was announced in November that year that Davies was appointed as technical adviser for the Namibian national side ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He began his role during Namibia's 2014 November internationals against Canada, the French Barbarians and Portugal. Despite strong performances, Namibia failed to win any of the games, losing 17–13, 35–14 and 29–20. He remained with the side during the 2015 World Rugby Nations Cup as an adviser, and after losing all three games then head coach Danie Vermeulen stood down on 25 June 2015.\nHead Coach of Namibia.\nOn 26 June 2015, it was announced that Davies would become Namibia's new head coach following the resignation of Vermeulen. Davies moved from the technical advisory role he held from 2014, to the head coach role just 3 months before Namibia participated in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and Davies first match in charge was on 11 July 2015 against Russia. Namibia claimed their first ever victory over Russia, beating them 39–19, before claiming a 45–5 win the following week to claim the series 2–0. Davies then lead Namibia into their final two matches in the 2015 Africa Cup. They knocked over Kenya, 46–13, and Zimbabwe, 80–6, to claim the Africa Cup title. Davies took the Namibian team to Durban, where Davies trained his side with the Springboks in a three-day training camp. Namibia proved to be much more competitive than in previous World Cups, where during the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Namibia picked up their first ever World Cup point, haven achieved a losing bonus points against Georgia after losing 17–16. In a pool that contained Argentina and New Zealand, Namibia only conceded 174 points, ahead of Uruguay who conceded 226. In Namibia's first game, they caused problems for the All Blacks who went on to win the game 58–18. Later, Namibia pushed Tonga to lose 35–21, though scored 3 tries in the match, the most scored by Namibia during a World Cup match. They finished their campaign with a 64–19 loss to Argentina on the final day of Pool matches.\nIn 2016, Davies led his side to second place in the 2016 World Rugby Nations Cup, only losing to Romania 20–8 in the opening round. Later in the year, he led Namibia to the 2016 Africa Cup title, winning all three games; Uganda (40–31), Kenya (56–21) and Zimbabwe (60–22). 2017 saw Namibia face top Tier 3 internationals from Europe in the 2017 World Rugby Nations Cup, facing Spain and Russia whilst also facing Italian B team, Emerging Italy. Namibia came away with a sole victory, beating the Italians 30–21 in the second round. In July 2017, Namibia continued their dominance in the African Cup, winning all five games of the 2017 Rugby Africa Gold Cup; Tunisia (53–7), Senegal (95–0), Zimbabwe (31–26), Uganda (48–24) and Kenya (45–7). Namibia's first ever test series against Uruguay proved difficult for Davies, losing the series 2–0, after losing the first test 52–36 and the second 39–34. 2017 proved an important year for Davies and Namibia, as it was final stage for the 2019 Rugby World Cup – Africa qualification. After winning all of their matches in the 2018 Africa Gold Cup, Namibia qualified for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, 8 points clear of Africa 2 nation, Kenya - who went to the Repechage tournament. During the 2018 November test window, Namibia came away with just one victory in three tests, after losing back-to-back matches against Russia and Spain, before narrowly defeating Portugal 29–23 in their final test of the year.\nThe start of the World Cup year saw Namibia win their first ever test match against Uruguay during the 2019 World Rugby Nations Cup. Despite this, Namibia went on to lose their other 2 games, finishing bottom of the table for the first time since 2015.\nReturn to Leeds Tykes.\nOn 3 January 2020 Yorkshire Carnegie (the former name of Leeds Tykes) announced that Davies had returned to Headingley as Director of Rugby replacing Martyn Wood.The club were bottom of the Championship having lost their first 13 games of the season.\nHonours.\nNamibia\nLeeds Tykes\nWorcester Warriors\nConsultancy company.\nIn December 2016, Davies rejoined Worcester Warriors as a coaching consultant in a bid to see the club stay afloat in the top tier of English Rugby. With Davies' help, Worcester remained in the top flight competition with key victories over leading teams Harlequins 24–17 and Saracens 24–18.\nIn June 2017, Davies returned home to Wales and was announced as head coach for his former club side, Llanelli. He doubled up his duties with Llanelli and Namibia throughout the season, until he left his post at the end of Welsh season. As part of the personal consultancy company he runs, he became a technical adviser for Nuneaton R.F.C. in 2018, and remained with the side until late 2018 before turning his attention to Namibia in 2019."

        "title": "Baseball World Cup",
        "text": "The Baseball World Cup (BWC) was an international baseball tournament for national teams around the world, sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF). First held in 1938 as the Amateur World Series (AWS), it was, for most of its history, the highest level of international baseball competition in the world. Even after it was supplanted in this regard in by the modern World Baseball Classic (WBC), the Baseball World Cup was still considered by the IBAF to be a major world championship, along with the WBC and the Summer Olympic Games.\nAfter the 2011 tournament, the Baseball World Cup was discontinued in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic; the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) – successor to the IBAF – now organizes the WBC and awards its winner the title of \"World Champion.\" Additionally, the WBSC sanctions two new tournaments: the biennial 23U Baseball World Cup (begun as the 21U Baseball World Cup in 2014) and its quadrennial, flagship tournament, the WBSC Premier12 (starting in 2015), which involves the twelve best-ranked national teams in the world. \nHistory.\nThe Baseball World Cup was held 38 times; the final one was in 2011 in Panama. The first tournament, held in 1938, featured only two teams, but the last tournament included 22 participants; the previous two featured 16 and 18 teams (in 2007 and 2005, respectively). The World Cup was originally called the Amateur World Series, until the tournament in 1988. \nThe 1938 Amateur World Series was organized by IBF president Leslie Mann, between the teams of the United States and Great Britain. Mann, along with Cuban sports administrator Jaime Mariné, helped turn the competition into an annual event in 1939.\nFor much of its early existence, the competition was limited to the nations of Central America and the Caribbean; the United States withdrew early from the 1942 series, and would not return until 1969. The next edition, in 1970, saw two European national teams (Italy and the Netherlands) participate for the first time; in 1972, Japan became the first Asian country to participate in the global baseball tournament.\nUntil 1998 the competition was limited to strictly amateur players. After 1998, professional minor league players competed, but Major League Baseball did not allow its players to participate. In the months leading up to the high-profile first World Baseball Classic in 2006, many commentators heralded it as a \"Baseball World Cup\", perhaps not realizing that a tournament of that description already existed and had for almost seventy years. \nHowever, the 2006 World Baseball Classic was the first international baseball tournament to include active players from the top-level major leagues around the world — namely Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball — making it a closer equivalent to the world cups of other sports, which commonly include players from the most prestigious professional leagues, than to the mostly-amateur Baseball World Cup.\nTrophy.\nThe champions of the first several Amateur World Series tournaments were presented the John Moores Trophy, named in honor of John Moores, a sponsor of the British Baseball Federation and future Everton F.C. executive. Like the Stanley Cup, it was a single trophy passed from winner to winner, with the names of the world champions engraved; however, only the winners of the 1938, 1939, and 1940 editions are engraved (England and Cuba); the United States withdrew from the AWS in 1942, and the trophy was apparently not awarded after that.\nWhen Jaime Mariné succeeded Leslie Mann as president of the IBF during the 1940 Amateur World Series, he renamed the trophy the \"Copa Presidente Batista\", after Fulgencio Batista, the president of Cuba. Mariné had participated in the Cuban Revolution of 1933 that brought Batista to power and had organized the dictator's Military Intelligence Service in 1935."

        "title": "Hook (boxing)",
        "text": "A hook is a punch in boxing. It is performed by turning the core muscles and back, thereby swinging the arm, which is bent at an angle near or at 90 degrees, in a horizontal arc into the opponent. A hook is usually aimed at the jaw, but it can also be used for body shots, especially to the liver.\nTechnique and variations.\nHook punches can be thrown by either the lead hand or the rear hand, but the term used without a qualifier usually refers to a lead hook.\nWhen throwing a hook, the puncher shifts his body weight to the lead foot, allowing him to pivot his lead foot and generate kinetic energy through the hip, torso, and shoulder, swinging his lead fist horizontally toward the opponent. Sometimes, depending on style and what feels comfortable to the individual, the lead foot is not pivoted. Pivoting increases the power of the punch, but leaves one lacking in options to follow up with, such as the right uppercut or right hook.\nThe hook is a powerful punch with knockout power.\nVariations of the hook are the \"shovel hook\" or \"upper-hook\"; they are body punches that combine characteristics of both the hook and the uppercut.\nAnother variation on the hook is the check hook, which combines an ordinary hook with footwork that removes a boxer from the path of a lunging opponent.\nSeveral boxers noted for their hooks are Joe Frazier, Bob Foster, Jack Dempsey, Henry Cooper, David Tua, Tommy Morrison, Rubén Olivares, Félix Trinidad, Andy Lee, Sam Hyde and Mike Tyson."

        "title": "John Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby",
        "text": "John Loader Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby, , (1 July 1877 – 20 April 1969) was a British civil servant and diplomat who was a key figure in Anglo-Irish relations during the Second World War.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nMaffey was the younger son of Thomas Maffey, a commercial traveller of Rugby, Warwickshire, and his wife, Mary Penelope, daughter of John Loader. He was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford.\nCareer.\nHe entered the Indian Civil Service in 1899, and notably served as Assistant Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of North-West-Frontier-Province from 1912 to 1916 and then as Private Secretary to the Viceroy of India Lord Chelmsford from 1916 to 1920 and then Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province from 1921 to 1924. He was appointed CSI in the 1920 Birthday Honours. He was attached to Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught during his visit to India. For his services he was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in February 1921. After a disagreement with the British government in 1924, Maffey resigned from the Indian Civil Service. In 1926 he became Governor-General of Sudan, followed in 1933 by his appointment as Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.\nRepresentative to Ireland.\nOn 14 September 1939, two weeks after the outbreak of World War II, Maffey arrived in Dublin to discuss the possibility of the United Kingdom appointing a British representative to Ireland. Later, following a discussion at the British War Cabinet, Maffey was sent back to Dublin again with a letter from Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appealing once again for the appointment of a 'representative'. The United Kingdom would not agree to appoint an ambassador or a minister, because it would imply that Ireland was a foreign country outside the Commonwealth. On the other hand, Ireland would not agree to the appointment of a High Commissioner to Ireland because that would imply that Ireland was in the Commonwealth which the Irish government did not accept. As a compromise, Chamberlain proposed the title \"United Kingdom Representative in Éire\" but de Valera rejected this, insisting that the word 'in' be replaced with 'to'. And so \"United Kingdom Representative to Éire\" was agreed upon and Maffey was appointed on 3 October 1939. For de Valera, the change signified Ireland's independence, sovereignty and equality with the United Kingdom.\nChamberlain remarked that the title would \"seem to be well suited to an appointment such as this which is essentially an emergency arrangement intended to meet a temporary but urgent situation\". After Maffey took up his appointment as \"Representative\", there were reports that the Irish Republican Army might abduct or kill him.\nMaffey held the post throughout the war years and until his retirement in 1949. During the war, he was undoubtedly the most important foreign diplomat resident in Dublin, given the complications of Ireland's neutrality policy. As \"United Kingdom Representative to Eire\", Maffey quickly established a good working relationship with Éamon de Valera. De Valera was personally in favour of the survival of democracy but did not necessarily trust the British to look after Ireland's best interests. Maffey was vital in mediating between the 'Warlord' Churchill and 'the Chief' de Valera.\nWhen de Valera was replaced by a coalition, headed by John A. Costello, in 1948, Maffey again established a good working relationship with its members, but he was scathing about the clumsy manner in which the declaration of a Republic was handled: \"Mr. Costello has handled the business in a slipshod and amateur fashion\".\nHe encouraged John Betjeman, the press attaché, to establish friendly relations with leading and rising figures in the Dublin literary world, such as Patrick Kavanagh; Maffey himself suggested the subject for one of Kavanagh's poems.\nIn his memorandum, \"The Irish Question in 1945\", addressed to the Secretary of State for the Dominions, Maffey expressed his view: \"To-day, after six years' detachment, Eire is more than ever a foreign country. It is so dominated by the National Catholic Church as to be almost a theocratic State. Gaelic is enforced in order to show that Eire is not one of the English-speaking nations; foreign games are frowned upon, the war censorship has been misapplied for anti-British purposes, anti-British feeling is fostered in school and by Church and State by a system of \"hereditary enemy \"indoctrination. There is probably more widespread anti-British sentiment in Eire to-day than ever before.\" Commenting on a recent attack by Churchill on de Valera, Maffey reported \"Nothing helped Mr. de Valera more than Mr. Churchill's personal attack... The Irish are a very distinct race, and their marked characteristics persist strongly... There still persist the dark Milesian strain, the tribal vendetta spirit, hatred and blarney, religious fanaticism, swift alternations between cruelty and laughter. A knowledge of the North-West Frontier tribes of India is a good introduction to an understanding of the Irish. They are both very remarkable and in many ways attractive people, with the same mental kinks. We were wise enough not to attempt to bring the Afridis under our direct rule.\" He continued \"Mr. de Valera is not himself a hater of England, as Mr. Frank Aiken, the Finance Minister, is... There is very little of the Irishman in Mr. de Valera. He is trusted because of his austerity and his cold mathematical approach to Anglo-Irish problems. He understands the narrowness of the Irish mind and does not venture on to broader paths, though he might certainly have led his people out of spiritual bondage in 1941, when America came into the war.\"\nMaffey felt that \"we can now talk to Eire on a cold, factual, horse-trading basis, knowing perfectly well that the cards are in our hands.\" He continued, \"It must be admitted that, by ascribing Dominion status to Eire, we placed in unfriendly hands a power to weaken the conception and responsibilities of Dominion status. Eire has none of the attributes of a Dominion. She is a \"Scotland \" gone wrong, and we cannot afford to let her be completely divorced from the strategic and economic zone of England, Scotland and Wales.\" Turning to Northern Ireland, Maffey remarked, \"Unhappily it is not possible for us to feel satisfied with the state of affairs in Northern Ireland. The Unionist Government are fighting an insidious enemy who is gaining upon them. Their ballot box is not safe over a period against the Catholic birth rate. The loyalty of the local garrison is not proof against the attractions of a lower income-tax rate in Eire. They are vulnerable to world criticism. The British Government cannot afford to ignore the pronouncement made in November 1944 by the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev. Dr. Griffin, that \"there is religious persecution at the present day in Northern Ireland\".\"\nIn February 1947, Maffey was raised to the peerage as Baron Rugby, of Rugby in the County of Warwick.\nHis portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the United Kingdom. Painted by Philip de László in 1923, it was the study for two official portraits, at Government House, Peshawar, and Christ Church, Oxford.\nFamily.\nLord Rugby married Dorothy Gladys Huggins, daughter of Charles Lang Huggins, on 28 August 1907. They became the parents of three children: Alan, Henry, and Penelope.\nTheir only daughter, Penelope, married the war hero and Tory MP Sir William Aitken and became a well-known socialite. She was the mother of the former Conservative politician Jonathan Aitken and the actress Maria Aitken. Her grandchildren are the actor Jack Davenport, the artiste and environmentalist Alexandra Aitken (also known as Uttrang Kaur Khalsa), Victoria Aitken, and William Aitken.\nLord Rugby died in April 1969, aged 91. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son Alan Loader Maffey, 2nd Baron Rugby.\nPopular culture.\nMaffey was played by Peter Copley in the 1983 RTÉ drama series \"Caught in a Free State\".\nHe is a minor character in the 2010 novel \"Long Time Coming\" by Robert Goddard."

        "title": "World Series of Golf (unofficial event)",
        "text": "The World Series of Golf was an annual golf competition. The competition differed from traditional golf tournaments in that the winner is decided not by the lowest stroke-play score or by winning a bracket-style elimination in match play, but by winning wagers bet on each hole in a betting style similar to poker.\nThe first event was held May 13–16, 2007, and was televised by NBC June 23–24, 2007. The second event was played May 12–15, 2008, and was televised by CBS on June 28–29.\nFormat.\nEach hole is conducted in a manner similar to a hand of Texas Hold 'Em. Each player begins the round with a stake, and a playing group consists of three to six players. In the inaugural tournament, the buy-in for each player is $10,000.\nBefore teeing off for each hole, each player bets an ante. The ante starts out at 1% of the opening stake for the round, i.e., $100 on the first hole of the opening round, and doubles every three holes. After the tee shots, players then check, raise or call bets, or fold and do not play the rest of that hole. Betting follows a prescribed order that rotates on each hole, just like \"the button\" in Hold 'Em, and playing of shots follows the same order, unlike traditional golf where the player whose ball is furthest from the hole shoots first on each shot. The pot is won by the player with the lowest score on each hole, or by the remaining player if all others have folded. A tie score on a hole (\"halved\" in match-play parlance) results in a split pot, much like a tie hand in poker.\nIf a player does not have enough money remaining in his or her stake to cover the ante for the next hole, he or she is eliminated and the remaining stake goes into the pot for the next hole.\nThe round ends when one player has won all the money from the others in his group, which may take more than 18 holes.\nAside from rule variations involving betting and the order in which players take their shots, the event is played under standard United States Golf Association rules.\nThe inaugural event was open to amateur golfers only. Players were paired with those of similar ability for the first round, which was played without handicaps. Handicap scoring was used for second and third rounds.\n2007 World Series of Golf.\nThe inaugural event was held at the Primm Valley Golf Club near Primm, Nevada. A field of 60 participants played three rounds.\nResults.\nWinner: Mark Ewing, day trader, Newport Beach, California\nOthers in final group: Phil Ivey, professional poker player, Las Vegas; Rhett Butler, professional poker player, Rockville, Maryland; Paul Schuller, electrician, Seattle, Washington; and Ken Tanner, retired railroad conductor, Penrose, Colorado.\nEwing won the event of the 16th hole of the final round by sinking a three-foot putt.\nOther notable entrants: actress Tanya Roberts; poker players Phil Gordon, Steve Dannenmann, Ken Einiger and Blair Rodman; professional blackjack player/author Max Rubin; former Denver Broncos quarterback Dave Kyle; and former Major League Baseball player Dusty Allen.\n2008 World Series of Golf.\nThe 2008 event was played May 12–15, 2008, at the Las Vegas Paiute Golf Resort. The event drew 80 contestants.\nResults.\nWinner: Andrew \"A.J.\" Johnson, automobile salesman, Davison, Michigan\nOthers in final group: Allen Cunningham, Erick Lindgren and Dee Tiller, all professional poker players, and Bill Spencer, a semi-retired builder. All but Johnson are from Las Vegas.\nJohnson defeated Lindgren on the first playoff hole. Johnson won $250,000, and Lindgren won $60,000.\nOther notable entrants:"

        "title": "NEC World Series of Golf",
        "text": "The World Series of Golf was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, played at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. From its inception in 1962 through 1975, it was an unofficial 36-hole event matching the winners of the four major championships. In 1976 it became an official PGA Tour event; the field expanded to 20 players and the event was lengthened to 72 holes. the victory and $100,000 winner's share went to Nicklaus. The field was increased to over 40 players in 1983, though it never exceeded 50; NEC began sponsoring the event in 1984.\nThe tournament was last played in 1998, but was replaced by the newly created WGC-NEC Invitational in 1999. Firestone Country Club had hosted that tournament (now known as the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational) every year until 2019, except for 2002.\nHistory.\nInvitation era.\nThe World Series of Golf was founded as a four-man invitational event in 1962, comprising the winners of the four major championships in a 36-hole event. In the made-for-television tournament, the competitors played in one group for $75,000 in unofficial prize money, televised by NBC.\nThe inaugural edition in September 1962 included only the \"Big Three\" of Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Palmer had won two majors that year and a fourth competitor was not added. Palmer shot a course record 65 in the first round on Saturday, but fell back with a 74 on Sunday. Nicklaus won with 135, four strokes ahead of Palmer and Player. Nicklaus, age 22, won a then-staggering $50,000, with $15,000 for second and $5,000 each for third and fourth, split between the other two for $12,500 each. Opposite this competition was the regular tour event in Denver, which had a winner's share of $4,300. The highest paying major at the time was the Masters with a winner's share of $20,000; Nicklaus had won $17,500 at the U.S. Open at Oakmont, which included a sizable $2,500 playoff bonus from the extra day's gate receipts, well-attended due to the presence of favorite son Palmer. At the time of his big Akron payday, the U.S. Open was Nicklaus' only tour victory as a rookie, but he won the next two events at Seattle ($4,300) and Portland ($3,500).\nIn 1963, Nicklaus won two majors, so a fourth player was added to the World Series via an 18-hole playoff between the three men who had lost playoffs in that year's majors; Palmer and Jacky Cupit in the U.S. Open and Phil Rodgers in the Open Championship. Palmer prevailed by five strokes in the August playoff. Nicklaus repeated as the World Series winner in September, one stroke ahead of Julius Boros, with Palmer in third and Bob Charles in fourth. The opposite tour event in 1963 was the Utah Open in Salt Lake City, with a winner's share of $6,400.\nThe first year with four players as reigning major champions was 1964, the first without Nicklaus. Tony Lema took the top spot, followed by Ken Venturi, Bobby Nichols, and Palmer. This was also the first year without a concurrent PGA Tour event.\nIn the final year of the four-man format in 1975, Tom Watson won with a two-stroke advantage over runner-up Nicklaus. The money was the same as in 1962, except that third place received $7,500, claimed by Tom Weiskopf. Nicklaus had won his second major of the year, the PGA Championship, at the same course a month earlier. In the fourteen editions of the event, Nicklaus played in ten, won four, and finished as runner-up in six.\nIn subsequent years, if one had won multiple majors, the alternate was the winner of the Western Open or Canadian Open.\nThe format of the four major winners in a 36-hole competition was later adopted by the PGA of America in 1979 for its PGA Grand Slam of Golf, last held in 2014.\nFrom 1961 through 1976, Firestone also hosted the American Golf Classic on the South course. It was not played in the years of the PGA Championship (1960, 1966, 1975), and the final edition in 1976 was played on the par-72 North course, with the World Series on the South course the following week.\nPGA Tour event.\nIn 1976, it became a 72-hole, $300,000 PGA Tour event and its field was initially expanded to twenty; the victory and $100,000 winner's share went to Nicklaus. The largest first prize at a major that year was $45,000 at the PGA Championship.\nThe World Series of Golf quickly became a leading event on the tour. For many years a victory in it gave a 10-year exemption on the PGA Tour, the same as was granted for a victory in a major championship at that time, and twice as long as is given even for winning a major now. The field consisted of the winners of all the high status men's professional golf tournaments around the world in the previous twelve months.\nThe field was expanded in 1984 to include some international players, all tour event winners, and the top fifteen on the current money list, with 47 players eligible. The expansion wasn't well-received by all players, and a notable absence was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who opted out.\nWinners.\nUnofficial event.\n^ Third place was $5,000 in the first three editions (1962–64)"

        "title": "Steve Avery (baseball)",
        "text": "Steven Thomas Avery (born April 14, 1970) is an American left-handed former pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers in his career.\nCareer.\nAtlanta Braves.\nAvery was the third overall selection by Atlanta in the 1988 amateur draft. He made his first career start on June 13, 1990, against the Cincinnati Reds at Riverfront Stadium, giving up eight runs in 2 innings. He finished his rookie year with a record of 3–11 in 21 starts with a 5.64 ERA. The pitching staff of Avery, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Pete Smith were dubbed Atlanta's \"Young Guns\".\n1991.\nThe 1991 season was a good year for both Avery and his team. The team went from worst to first in the NL West while Avery compiled a record of 18–8 with a 3.38 ERA. He gave the Braves their first win of the season, a 7–5 victory over the defending World Champion Cincinnati Reds. In the heat of a September pennant race with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the 21-year-old Avery beat them twice, 9–1 at home on September 15, and 3–0 on the road on September 20, pitching a complete game both times. Avery's last win of the regular season was a stellar performance against the Houston Astros. On October 4, Avery threw a no-hitter for 6 innings until Luis Gonzalez broke it up with a single. His amazing season continued with one of the greatest postseason performances in history. He shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates for 16 innings over two games and accumulated two 1–0 wins. His performance earned him MVP honors for the 1991 NLCS. In the 1991 World Series, Avery earned no decisions in two starts but pitched effectively in both Game Three and Game Six.\nContinued success.\nIn 1992, Avery lowered his ERA to 3.20, but his record fell off to 11–11, mostly due to the Braves inability to score runs when he pitched. However, his playoff success continued when he took the mound against the Pirates in the 1992 NLCS. He extended his mastery over the Pittsburgh offense to 22 shutout innings before giving up five runs in the seventh inning of a Braves rout in Game Two. After lasting only of an inning and giving up four runs in his second start in Game Five, Avery kept the Pirates at bay in the crucial middle innings of Game Seven in relief of John Smoltz. Avery's clutch performance kept the game close enough for Francisco Cabrera to perform his game-winning heroics in the ninth inning, when he cracked a two-run single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream.\nAvery started Game Three of the 1992 World Series and was the losing pitcher in the first World Series game ever played outside the United States. He pitched effectively but lost, 3–2, to the Toronto Blue Jays. In Game Six, he was pulled after giving up a home run to Candy Maldonado in the fourth inning. Avery appeared on his way to another loss, but a Braves rally extended the game into the eleventh inning before the Blue Jays prevailed, winning their first World Series and saddling the hard-luck Braves with their second consecutive World Series defeat.\nUnexpected decline.\nIn 1993, Avery had the best season of his career. He was selected to the All-Star team and had a record of 16–4 entering the September 12, 1993 game against the San Diego Padres. Avery lost and suffered an injury to a muscle under his pitching armpit. Many blame Avery's injury on his heavy workload as a young pitcher; he had started 135 major league games before reaching the age of 24. Avery was never again the same pitcher, although he ended the year 18–6 with a 2.94 ERA.\nAvery was outpitched early in Game One of the 1993 NLCS by Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies. A late rally tied the game and got Avery off the hook, but the Braves still lost. In his second matchup with Schilling, the Braves again got Avery off the hook for the loss, but again ultimately lost the game in extra innings, 4–3.\nAvery's career went rapidly downhill after his injury. His record after September 12, 1993, was 44–50 after compiling a 47–22 record from the beginning of 1991 until the injury. However, Avery showed occasional flashes of his previous brilliance. After struggling throughout 1995, Avery started Game Four of the 1995 NLCS with the Braves up three games to none over the Reds. He pitched an outstanding game and won, 6–0, sending Atlanta into the World Series. In Game Four of the 1995 World Series, he was the surprise starter over ace Greg Maddux, and he was also the winner, 5–2, pitching six innings and giving up one run against the Cleveland Indians. That was his only victory in a World Series and eventually Atlanta won the title that year in six games. His lifetime record in World Series is 1-2 with 5 saves.\nAvery missed two months with injury in 1996 and finished with a 7–10 record. His only appearance in the 1996 World Series was in the top of the 10th inning of Game Four, a game that saw the Braves blow a 6–0 lead to the New York Yankees en route to an 8–6 loss in the game. Pitching innings, Avery earned the loss, giving up a hit, a run, and three walks, the last of which (to Wade Boggs) forced in the go-ahead run. Atlanta manager Bobby Cox earned some criticism at the time owing to his decision to have Avery intentionally walk Bernie Williams to load the bases for Boggs.\nBoston, Cincinnati and Detroit.\nWith his career in a sudden and premature decline, Avery was granted free agency and signed with the Boston Red Sox on January 22, 1997. He pitched two years for the Red Sox, going 16–14 over two seasons as the number two starter behind Pedro Martínez.\nHe signed a one-year contract with the Reds for the 1999 season. He was 6–7 when he was lost for the rest of the year in July to a torn labrum. He signed with the Braves during spring training in 2000 and again during spring training in 2001, but failed to make the club each time.\nIn 2003, Avery made a brief comeback with the Detroit Tigers team that threatened to break the 120-loss record of the 1962 New York Mets. He made 19 relief appearances, including the final appearance of his career on July 20, 2003, at U.S. Cellular Field against the Chicago White Sox. His final pitch was a double play caused when Paul Konerko lined to Avery and he threw Magglio Ordóñez out before he was able to get back to first base.\nAvery was 2-0 and batted 1.000 as a Tiger.\nIn an eleven-season career, Avery posted a 96–83 record with 980 strikeouts and a 4.19 ERA in 1554 innings pitched."

        "title": "Iron-hulled sailing ship",
        "text": "Iron-hulled sailing ships represented the final evolution of sailing ships at the end of the age of sail. They were built to carry bulk cargo for long distances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were the largest of merchant sailing ships, with three to five masts and square sails, as well as other sail plans. They carried lumber, guano, grain or ore between continents. Later examples had steel hulls. They are sometimes referred to as \"windjammers\" or \"tall ships\". Several survive, variously operating as school ships, museum ships, restaurant ships, and cruise ships.\nHistory.\nIron-hulled sailing ships were mainly built from the 1870s to 1900, when steamships began to outpace them economically, due to their ability to keep a schedule regardless of the wind. Steel hulls started to become common from 1885, providing an even greater strength to weight ratio. Even into the twentieth century, sailing ships could hold their own on ultra-long voyages such as Australia to Europe, since they did not require bunkerage for coal nor freshwater for steam, and they were faster than steamers, which usually could barely make . Many sailed under the Finnish flag during at least some part of their careers. Ship-owner Gustaf Erikson of Mariehamn, Åland, Finland, was noted for his fleet during the interwar period. Other sailing ship companies carrying on despite the onset of the machine age were F. Laeisz of Hamburg and A.D. Bordes of Dunkirk.\nThe four-masted, iron-hulled ship, introduced in 1875 with the full-rigged , represented an especially efficient configuration that prolonged the competitiveness of sail against steam in the later part of the 19th century. The largest example of such ships was the five-masted full-rigged ship , which had a load capacity of 7,800 tons. She was also one of the fastest, regularly logging average speed on transatlantic voyages. Unfortunately speed was her undoing, as she collided with a steamer that underestimated the speed of the \"Preussen\" when crossing before her. The second-largest example was \"France II\".\nDesign.\nThe last large commercial sailing vessels, designed well after the Industrial Revolution, used engineered iron and steel in their construction. In general, the ships displaced between 2,000 and 5,000 tons and were cheaper than their wooden-hulled counterparts for three main reasons: (1) iron was stronger and enabled larger ship size, capable of delivering considerable economies of scale, (2) iron hulls took up less space, allowing more room for cargo in a given hull size, and (3) iron required less maintenance than a wooden hull.\nThe large sail plans and raked bows of these vessels invite confusion with clippers, but there are significant differences. Clippers were optimized for speed, these vessels were optimized for cargo capacity and ease of handling. Most clippers were of composite construction (iron structure, wooden planking), full rigged and had a cargo capacity of less than 1,000 tonnes; these vessels were iron and steel hulled, usually barque rigged, and had far greater cargo capacities. Clippers had already begun to disappear when these vessels emerged.\nTypically, such vessels were equipped with steel masts and yards and steel cables, where possible. Often the running rigging was handled by motor-driven winches powered by donkey engines. The combination of a large, efficient sail plan and hydrodynamic hull allowed these sailing ships to sustain high cruising speeds; most four-masted barques were able to cruise at with favorable winds. Some logged regularly and \"Herzogin Cecilie\" is known to have logged .\nCrew.\nA sailing ship from this era could have a crew of as few as 14, with a typical crew being master, mate, boatswain (bosun), 15 seamen and 5 apprentices. \"Herzogin Cecilie\" in 1926 sailed around Cape Horn with \"only 19 men aboard, although not from choice.\" The crew roster of on her last commercial voyage around Cape Horn in 1949 under the Finnish flag listed a total complement of 33:\nOwners ran their sailing ships with close attention to costs. Officers and essential skilled crew, such as sailmakers, were still paid poorly: the captain of \"Moshulu\" in 1938 received about $100/month and the average sailmaker about $20/month. \"The wages of other crew members were minuscule. A skilled able seaman (rated as an A.B.) received not more than, and often much less than, sixteen dollars per month.\" Crews were readily available in spite of abysmal pay because Germany and Scandinavian countries still required sail experience for mariner's licences.\nDiscipline, at the end of the 19th century, \"especially on American sailing ships, could be brutal, often unnecessarily so.\" As the end of the sailing ship era drew near by the 1930s, \"such tactics had pretty much disappeared in the Finnish ships [and] in the ... German ships.\" However, even the Finnish mates occasionally enforced discipline with their fists while sailing with minimal crews of largely inexperienced youths when \"... instant obedience to orders was essential.\"\nEconomics.\nThough a fast-disappearing breed by the 1920s, sailing ships were used commercially until the 1950s. They occupied a niche in the transport of low-value bulk cargoes of little interest to steamship companies, e.g., lumber, coal, guano or grain (60,000 sacks on \"Pamir\"). Cargoes were carried from remote ports, with fuel and water unavailable, such as Australia (carrying wool or grain), remote Pacific islands (guano) and South America (nitrates). These vessels usually followed the clipper route around the world, ideally carrying different cargoes on each leg of their route, but most frequently sailing in ballast. The last leg from Australia to Europe, where the cargo was wheat or barley, became the source of The Great Grain Races as the ships' masters attempted to sail the leg as fast as possible, essentially only for prestige and pride — usually from the grain ports of South Australia's Spencer Gulf to Lizard Point at the Cornwall coast and on to the harbour of destination in Britain or continental Europe.\nIn the 1930s 'good money' could be made in the grain trade from Australia to Europe, \"the carrying rates could vary from perhaps four dollars to eight dollars per ton.\" The owners of the \"Parma\" bought their vessel in 1932 for about ten thousand dollars and then loaded over 5,200 tons or 62,650 sacks of grain, for a gross income of $40,000. \"The ship paid for herself and all her expenses for the year from the income of that one voyage even though she had sailed in ballast halfway around the world.\" In most of those years, the ships in the grain trade could clear about $5,000 each.\nThe Germans in particular maintained profitable commerce through the 1930s to the west coast of South America, shipping general cargo out and nitrates home. They had built powerful vessels, such as the , \"Padua\" and \"Priwall\" especially for the difficult west-bound voyage around Cape Horn, and their captains were expected to make three round trips around the Horn over a two-year period.\nDespite the cost, some of the ships used the Panama Canal, towed by tugs the entire course, avoiding the Horn.\nRemaining ships.\nA few such tall ships can still be seen at international maritime events such as SAIL Amsterdam, the Kiel Week and Hanse Sail.\nThe largest remaining original sailing ship is the four-masted barque , today a restaurant ship moored in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The largest sailing ship still in service is a Russian school ship, the four-masted barque . The last metal-hulled sailing ship in original layout is the , today a museum ship at Mariehamn.\nRemaining iron or steel-hulled ships include:"

        "title": "The International (golf)",
        "text": "The International (styled as The INTERNATIONAL) was a professional golf tournament in Colorado on the PGA Tour. It was played for 21 seasons, from 1986 through 2006, at the Castle Pines Golf Club at Castle Pines Village in Castle Rock, south of Denver.\nIt had the distinction of being one of two PGA Tour events not conducted at traditional stroke play, the only other exception is the match-play event, the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. The International was the only tournament to use the Modified Stableford scoring system, enacted because of the significant elevation of the venue, which averages above sea level.\nBeginning in 2007, the International was scheduled to change dates to be played during the first full weekend of July (July 5–8, and July 4–7, 2008), midway between the U.S. Open and the British Open. Tournament officials hoped this new date would draw even more top-ranked players, such as Tiger Woods, as it would no longer be contested the week before (or after) the year's final major (PGA Championship). Even with the change in dates, both tournament founder Jack A. Vickers and the membership of the club were apparently not happy with the overall direction the PGA Tour was taking.\nOn February 8, 2007, the PGA Tour announced the permanent cancellation of the International. It was replaced by the AT&amp;T National, hosted by the Tiger Woods Foundation, and held in the Washington, D.C. area; near sea level and at standard stroke play.\nThe Modified Stableford scoring system returned to the PGA Tour in 2012 at the Reno–Tahoe Open, also at high elevation.\nFormat.\nThe Modified Stableford system awards points on each hole, based on the score relative to par. It is designed to reward aggressive play, taking chances to go for birdies (or better), as the reward for a low score on a hole is typically greater than the punishment for a poor score. For example, over a two-hole span, a birdie (+2) and a bogey (−1) gain one point, where two pars gain nothing. The scoring operates as follows:\nHoles in one are treated as the score relative to par; an ace on a par-3 hole would be considered an eagle and scored as +5.\nThe International used several different formats throughout its history. Until 1993, final-round scores alone determined the winner; additionally, the event had multiple cuts in every year except 2005."

        "text": "Curling at the 2006 Winter Olympics was held in the town of Pinerolo, Italy from February 13 to February 24. It proved to be the sleeper hit in terms of television ratings in Italy. According to a CBC feature, curling at the 2006 Winter Games drew 5 million viewers, eclipsing ice hockey and figure skating. This, and the success of the Italian men's curling team created a surge of interest in curling within Italy, where there was no previous tradition of the sport and only a few hundred players.\nSummary.\nDays before the 2006 Winter Games began, the IOC confirmed that the curling competition at the 1924 Winter Olympics was an official event, and not a demonstration event as many authoritative sources had previously claimed. However, the IOC itself had never done so. This official confirmation was the culmination of an investigative campaign begun by the Glasgow-based newspaper \"The Herald\" , on behalf of the families of the eight Scots who won the first curling Olympic gold medal in Chamonix, France in 1924. The winning team was selected by the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, Perth, the mother club of curling.\nDefending champion skips Rhona Martin of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland and Pål Trulsen of Norway returned to defend their gold medals. Joining Martin on the women's side were 2005 World champion Anette Norberg of Sweden, 2002 World Junior champion Cassandra Johnson of the United States of America, two-time world champion Dordi Nordby of Norway, 1996 European champion Mirjam Ott of Switzerland, 2004 Canadian Mixed champion Shannon Kleibrink of Canada, 2005 European Junior Challenge champion Ludmila Privivkova of Russia, three time Pacific Curling champion Ayumi Onodera of Japan, 1994 European champion Dorthe Holm of Denmark, and for the host country, 2003 World Junior bronze medalist Diana Gaspari from Italy.\nJoining Trulsen on the men's side was 2001 World Junior Champion Brad Gushue of Canada with the help of two-time World champion Russ Howard calling the shots, former World Junior champion and European champion David Murdoch of Great Britain, two-time European champion Andy Kapp of Germany, 2000 European champion and 2005 European mixed champion Markku Uusipaavalniemi of Finland, 1993 World Championship bronze medalist Pete Fenson of the United States of America, 1997 World Junior champion Ralph Stöckli of Switzerland, three-time Pacific Curling champion Sean Becker of New Zealand, three-time World Champion Peja Lindholm of Sweden, and the host Italian team skipped by Joel Retornaz.\nWomen's.\nSchedule.\nDraw 1 - Monday, February 13, 1400.\n\"Note: hammers denote the team that had the last stone in the first end.\"\nSemi-finals - Wednesday, February 22, 1400.\n1 vs. 4 &lt;br&gt;\nIn a close game, Sweden's Anette Norberg (1) edged out Norway's Dordi Nordby (4). The turning point of the game came in the eighth end when Sweden scored the only steal of the game. From this point on the Swedish team was ahead. Anette Norberg curled 85% while Dordi Nordby struggled, which was the difference in the game.\n2 vs. 3 &lt;br&gt;\nIn the other semi-final, Canada's Shannon Kleibrink team (3) faced off against Mirjam Ott of Switzerland (2). After Ott scored 3 in the third end getting a split off a rock in front of the house, Kleibrink was unable to mount a comeback. The Swiss team managed to keep in the lead for the rest of the game. Mirjam Ott curling 88% in the game ensured victory for the Swiss team, while Shannon Kleibrink struggled at 66%.\nBronze medal game - Thursday, February 23, 1300.\nCanada scored four in the first end after Dordi Nordby, the Norwegian skip flopped her rock over on a heavy freeze attempt and was removed by Shannon Kleibrink, the Canadian skip on her last rock. With three other Canadian rocks in the house, Canada scored four. Canada never looked back, scoring four more points in the fifth end en route to an 11-5 thrashing of Norway.\nGold medal game - Thursday, February 23, 1730.\nSweden held the lead for much of the game, but saw the Swiss team start to claw back late in the game. In the 8th end, a decision by Swedish skip Anette Norberg to hit an unthreatening rock out of the house on her last rock instead of a guard was followed by a great raise of a Swiss rock on to a small corner of the button by Swiss skip Mirjam Ott. This brought the Swiss within one point of a tie. They continued to claw back, and after ten ends the game was tied, so they had to go to another. In the 11th end, the Swiss played a good end, leaving Anette Norberg a difficult double take-out on her last rock to win the gold medal. Norberg was successful, leaving her stone in the house to win the game, and the gold medal, 7–6.\nRound robin final player percentages.\n\"Minimum 6 games.

Finland (1) had the hammer, and skip Markku Uusipaavalniemi had to put a rock right on the button to win the game. It was either that or a difficult hit and roll off a British (4) rock in the four-foot frozen to a Finnish rock. British skip David Murdoch had an excellent raise hit and roll to make the freeze on his last rock, but it was no match for Markku's draw—giving Finland the win.\n&lt;section begin=M46 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=M46 /&gt;\n2 vs. 3\nIn the other semi-final, Canada (2) outplayed the Americans (3) for most of the game propelling them to victory. The Americans kept it close for most of the game, always within a few points until the ninth end. With Canada having the hammer, USA skip Pete Fenson had a difficult draw to beat out four Canadian stones and get buried but half of the rock was left out in the open. Canada's skip Brad Gushue peeled off Fenson's rock on his last, giving Gushue five points, at which point the American team conceded.\n&lt;section begin=M47 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=M47 /&gt;\nBronze medal game - Friday, February 24, 1300.\nUS skip Pete Fenson got the victory after hitting a British stone in the open on his last shot of the game, giving him the only point he needed in the 8–6 victory. The momentum for the Americans began in the third end however, when the Americans scored a three-ender. David Murdoch, the British skip tried to draw to the button on top of two American stones, but was a few inches short, leaving the rock in the open. It was easily tapped out by Fenson giving the Americans three points, and they never trailed after that point, going on to win the country's first Olympic curling medal. The game was interrupted by a streaker wearing a rubber chicken, prompting one of the British players to joke, \"Are you Scottish?\"\n&lt;section begin=M48 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=M48 /&gt;\nGold medal game - Friday, February 24, 1730.\nAfter Finland skip Markku Uusipaavalniemi missed an opportunity with the hammer in the 1st end, scoring only two points instead of three (0-2), Canada dominated and scored two points with the hammer in the 2nd end (2-2) before stealing the next two ends with a point in each (4-2). Finland finally won a point with the hammer in the 5th end to reduce the deficit (4-3), but numerous Finnish mistakes led to Canada's scoring six points in the 6th end (10-3), which effectively won the match and secured the gold medal. Brad Gushue of Canada actually had the chance to score an unusual seventh point with the hammer, but his draw shot had too much weight and together with some furious sweeping at the house by the Finland skip, it passed through the house. As it is, six is very unusual as well, and Gushue blamed the miss on nerves.\nHowever, Gushue's miss was of little consequence due to Canada's lead. By this time, Finland wanted to concede, but had to carry on until the 8th end before being allowed to do so. They finished 10–4 with no points in the 7th end and one point in the 8th end. It was Canada's first gold medal in men's curling after winning silver at Nagano in 1998 and Salt Lake City in 2002. School children in Newfoundland and Labrador, where four of the five Canadians are from, had the afternoon off from school to watch the game. Those four Newfoundlanders were the first to ever win a gold medal at the Olympics. Mark Nichols, Canada's third, played phenomenally with a 97% shooting percentage. His raise-triple take-out in the sixth end was a major factor in Canada's scoring the six-point rarity.\n&lt;section begin=M49 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=M49 /&gt;\nRound robin final player percentages.\n\"Minimum 6 games.

Therefore, Nagano had to win two games against Aomori to win, while Aomori needed to win either of the games.\nWomen.\nPlayoffs\nOther nations.\nThe teams for most of the other nations were selected by a committee, usually by the governing body of the sport in that nation. The countries qualified based on a point system based on World Championship results.

        "title": "Scottish Open (golf)",
        "text": "The Genesis Scottish Open is a professional golf tournament in Scotland, and is one of five tournaments that are part of the Rolex Series, which identifies it as one of the European Tour's premier events. It has been played on various courses, but in recent years it has been played on a links course, appealing to players who wish to gain experience before the Open, which takes place in the following week.\nSince 1987 it has, together with John Deere Classic, been the last chance to qualify for The Open. It has been part of the Open Qualifying Series since that series started in 2014. The leading 3 players (4 in 2016) not already qualified, have received an entry to the Open. Before 2014 there was generally an exemption category so that the leading player or players, not already qualified, could play in the Open.\nThe Scottish Open became a Rolex Series event in 2017 (when the series was inaugurated), which meant the prize fund was increased to $7 million. Beginning in 2022, the tournament was co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour and title sponsored by Genesis.\nHistory.\n1972 and 1973.\nThe first Sunbeam Electric Scottish Open was part of the 1972 European Tour and was held at Downfield Golf Club in Dundee. Neil Coles beat Brian Huggett at the second hole of a sudden-death playoff, holing a 12-foot putt. Total prize money was £10,000 with a first prize of £2,000. Sunbeam Electric had sponsored the Sunbeam Electric Tournament in 1971.\nIn 1973 the event was played on the Old Course at St Andrews. Graham Marsh won by 6 strokes from Peter Oosterhuis. Total prize money was increased to £15,000 with a first prize of £2,500.\nBoth 1972 and 1973 tournaments were broadcast extensively on ITV. The tournament was cancelled when television coverage could not be arranged in 1974.\n1986 revival.\nThe event returned to the European Tour calendar in 1986 when, under a new sponsorship deal with Bell's, the Glasgow Open, which had been held at Haggs Castle Golf Club from 1983 to 1985, was rebranded as the Scottish Open. After remaining at Haggs Castle for the first year, the tournament moved to Gleneagles in 1987 and was played the week before the Open Championship. 1987 also saw the BBC broadcast live coverage of the event, and continued to do so until 1993. It remained at Gleneagles until Bell's withdrew their sponsorship in 1994 following the switch of TV coverage from BBC to SKY that year. In 1995 and 1996 it was held, without a sponsor, at Carnoustie.\nThe 1986 event had prize money of £130,000 with a first prize of £21,660. This rose to £200,000 with a first prize of £33,330 for the 1987 event at Gleneagles. This had risen to £600,000 and a first prize of £100,000 for the 1992 tournament. Despite the loss of Bell's sponsorship the prize money increased to £650,000 in 1995 but, with the event losing money, this was reduced to £480,000 in 1996.\nLoch Lomond.\nFrom 1997 the Scottish Open's pre-Open place on the European Tour schedule was taken by the Loch Lomond World Invitational, which had been first held at Loch Lomond Golf Club in September 1996. The top-60 in the World Rankings were invited but few non-Europeans entered. The event was broadcast by the BBC. From 1997 to 2000 the Loch Lomond event was played the week before the Open Championship. These events did not use the Scottish Open name, the rights to which were owned by ISM. From 2001, it was decided that the Loch Lomond event would be known as the Scottish Open and all prior editions, including the September 1996 event, would be granted Scottish Open status. This resulted in the anomaly of there being two \"Scottish Opens\" in 1996. The September 1996 event had a first prize of £125,000, rising to £133,330 in 1997 and £183,330 by 2000.\nThe 2001 Scottish Open was run without a main sponsor but from 2002 it was known as the Barclays Scottish Open, and was played at Loch Lomond until 2010. Some concern was expressed that the course, which is very different from the links courses on which the Open Championship is played, put European Tour players at a disadvantage compared to their leading rivals from the PGA Tour, who traditionally spent a week practising for the Open on links courses in Ireland.\nLinks courses.\nIn 2011 it was held at Castle Stuart Golf Links, near Inverness, due to the financial difficulties being suffered by Loch Lomond. Play was reduced to 54 holes (three rounds) in the tournament due to heavy rain, which caused flooding and landslides. Aberdeen Asset Management took over sponsorship in 2012, but the event remained at Castle Stuart in 2012 and 2013 before moving to Royal Aberdeen Golf Club in 2014. It was played at Gullane Golf Club in 2015 and at Castle Stuart Golf Links in 2016. In 2016, the attendance figures at Castle Stuart were disappointing, with a reduction of more than 20,000 to 41,809 over the four tournament days. In 2017 it was held in Ayrshire, for the first time in its current guise, at Dundonald Links, and was played at Gullane again in 2018. Since 2019 the event has been held at the Renaissance Club and is scheduled to remain there until 2026.\nDisability Event.\nFrom 2019, a 36-hole EDGA (European Disabled Golf Association) Scottish Open event of ten players takes place on the same course on the Saturday and Sunday morning of the main event.\nWinners.\nSources:\nPrevious event of same name.\nIn 1935 Gleneagles hosted a Scottish Open Championship held on the King's course. Total prize money was £750. The R&amp;A objected to the use of the term \"Championship\" being used for a tournament organised by a private enterprise. Percy Alliss won the tournament by 4 strokes from Jack Busson with an aggregate of 273. The 1936 tournament was sponsored by Penfold and known as the Penfold Scottish Open. Penfold had sponsored tournaments in Wales and England from 1932 to 1934. The tournament was played at Ayr Belleisle Golf Club. Total prize money was again £750. After 72 holes Jimmy Adams and Tom Collinge tied on 287. In the 36-hole playoff, Adams had rounds of 68 and 69 and won by 11 strokes. It was intended to hold the 1937 Penfold Scottish Open in the Carnoustie area, just before the 1937 Open Championship which was to be played there. The R&amp;A objected to the arrangement and the event was cancelled. Penfold resumed their golf sponsorship with the Penfold Professional Golf League in 1938."

It is administered by the Professional Golfers' Association of America and is recognized as a major championship by both PGA Tour Champions and the European Senior Tour. It was formerly an unofficial money event on the European Senior Tour, but since 2007 has been an official money event. Winners gain entry into the next PGA Championship. The winners prior to 1980, the first season of the senior tour, are not considered major champions of this event by the PGA Tour Champions.\nThe lower age limit is 50, which is the standard limit for men's senior professional golf tournaments.

The tournament committee gives former winners of the PGA Professional National Championship a one time invitation upon turning 50 years of age and the top 35 club professionals who qualify through the Senior PGA Professional National Championship. \nHistory.\nThe inaugural event was played in 1937 at Augusta National Golf Club, with 54-year-old Jock Hutchison winning the 54-hole event on Thursday, December 2. The second edition at Augusta was reduced to 36 holes due to rain, but had an 18-hole playoff on December 9 to decide the winner, Fred McLeod. The next edition was moved to Florida in January, No tournaments were held in 1943 and 1944 due to World War II. The event returned in 1945 at the PGA National Golf Course, where it stayed until 1962. The event moved to different courses in Florida through 2000. Due to scheduling moves, two tournaments were played in 1979 and 1984 and none in 1983, and 1985.\nIt moved from winter to mid-April in 1990 and when it rotated to various sites in 2001, it became a late spring event, played in late May or early June.\nIt was a 36-hole event until 1954; after four years at 54 holes, it became a 72-hole event in 1958.

        "title": "Volleyball at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Volleyball has been part of the Summer Olympics program for both men and women consistently since 1964.\nBrazil, the United States and the former Soviet Union are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining six editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including Japan, Poland, Netherlands, Russia, France, and the defunct Yugoslavia.\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fifteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only six countries: Brazil, Cuba, China, Japan, the United States and the former Soviet Union.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where it was an unofficial exhibition event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after World War II, with the foundation of the FIVB and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the 53rd IOC session in Sofia, Bulgaria, to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in 1964. The International Olympic Committee attempted to drop volleyball for the 1968 Olympics, but this was met with protest.\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the World Cup: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in 1972, this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since 1996, both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\nMen's winners.\nThe first two editions of the volleyball Olympic tournament were won by the Soviet Union team. Bronze in 1964 and silver in 1968, Japan won gold in 1972. In 1976, the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped Poland win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\nIn 1980, many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the Eastern Bloc, so the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3–1 victory over Bulgaria. With a Soviet-led boycott in 1984, the United States confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over Brazil at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, Italy, won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the 1988 final: powerplayers Karch Kiraly and Steve Timmons pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\nIn 1992, Brazil upset favorites Unified Team, Netherlands, and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with Ron Zwerver and Olof van der Meulen, came back in the following edition for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, Serbia and Montenegro, led by Vladimir and Nikola Grbić, beat Russia at the final in 2000 to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).\nIn 2004, Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In 2008, United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the 2012 final, Russia came back from a 0–2 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. Dmitriy Muserskiy scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in 2016 after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final. The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0–2 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.\nThe 2020 tournament, held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing a delay, had the French team of Earvin N'Gapeth win it all over the Russians. In a repeat of the 1988 bronze medal match, Brazil were upset by neighbor Argentina.\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining six editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, and never missing a tournament since 1976 Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\nWomen's winners.\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in 1964, was won by the host nation Japan. There followed two victories in a row by the Soviet Union, in 1968 and 1972. South Korea were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in 1976 for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\nThe American-led boycott of the 1980 Games left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In 1984, the Eastern bloc was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation United States won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to China. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over Peru after trailing 0–2 in 1988's marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba, who would become the next dominating force.\n1992 saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name Unified Team, the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars Mireya Luis and Regla Torres, Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in 1996 and 2000 against China and Russia, respectively.\nIn 2004, the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat Brazil in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1–2, 19–24 in the fourth set.\nIn 2008, Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in 2012 after beating the United States once again in the final. Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\nIn 2016, home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating Serbia in four sets in the gold medal match. In the process, Lang Ping became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro. China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round. The United States defeated Netherlands 3–1 to capture the bronze medal.\nIn the fifteenth edition of the games in 2020, the United States faced Brazil for the third final in four editions, only this time they broke the long title drought. Thus the Americans became only the sixth country to win the women's tournament, after Brazil, China, Cuba, Japan, and the former Soviet Union. Serbia got the bronze, beating South Korea.\nCompetition formula.\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\nTotal medal table.\nSources:"

        "text": "Matthew Christian Morris (born August 9, 1974) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through , most notably as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, where he was a two-time All-Star and led the National League in with 22 wins.

In 2004, he lost 10 games for the first time in his career and had a 4.72 ERA, also a career high. On June 20 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 500th home run off Morris.\nMorris underwent surgery during the 2004/ off-season and started the season 8–0 with a 3.16 ERA, and was 10–2 with a 3.10 ERA at the time of the All-Star break. In fact, he was considered by many to be snubbed for the All-Star game. Morris went 4–7 with a 5.55 ERA after the All-Star break. He was the number three starter for the Cardinals in the playoffs, behind ace Chris Carpenter and Mark Mulder. He became the first winning pitcher in a postseason game at Petco Park when the Cardinals defeated the San Diego Padres in Game 3 of the 2005 NLDS. In the thin free agent market of the 2005/ off-season, Morris was touted as one of the best available pitchers.\nOn December 12, 2005, Morris signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants worth $27 million. He had an injury-filled year with the Giants in 2006, going 10–15 with a 4.98 ERA.\nPrior to the season, Morris changed his uniform number from 35, which he had worn for his entire career, to wear number 22 as a tribute to retired former teammate Mike Matheny. Rich Aurilia took the number 35 jersey.\nOn July 31, 2007, Morris was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for center field prospect Rajai Davis and pitcher Stephen MacFarland.\nMorris started off the 2008 season with a 0–4 record and a 9.67 ERA in five starts. On April 27, 2008, Morris was released by the Pirates. He retired three days later, on April 30, .\nPersonal life.\nMorris married the former Heather Reader on December 7, 2002, and together they have four children, Lola Morris, Sydney Morris, Harper Morris, Peyton Morris. As of 2014, they lived in Big Sky, Montana."

        "title": "Tarsus (skeleton)",
        "text": "In the human body, the tarsus (: tarsi) is a cluster of seven articulating bones in each foot situated between the lower end of the tibia and the fibula of the lower leg and the metatarsus. It is made up of the midfoot (cuboid, medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiform, and navicular) and hindfoot (talus and calcaneus).\nThe tarsus articulates with the bones of the metatarsus, which in turn articulate with the proximal phalanges of the toes. The joint between the tibia and fibula above and the tarsus below is referred to as the ankle joint proper.\nIn humans the largest bone in the tarsus is the calcaneus, which is the weight-bearing bone within the heel of the foot.\nHuman anatomy.\nBones.\nThe talus bone or ankle bone is connected superiorly to the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, to form the ankle joint or talocrural joint; inferiorly, at the subtalar joint, to the calcaneus or heel bone. Together, the talus and calcaneus form the hindfoot.\nThe five irregular bones of the midfoot—the cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones—form the arches of the foot which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to the hind- and forefoot by muscles and the plantar fascia.\nMovements.\nThe complex motion of the subtalar joint occurs in three planes and produces subtalar inversion and eversion. Along with the transverse tarsal joint (i.e. talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joint), the subtalar joint transforms tibial rotation into forefoot supination and pronation. \nThe axis of rotation in the joint is directed upward 42 degrees from the horizontal plane and 16 degrees medially from the midline of the foot. \nHowever, together, the subtalar facets form a screw or Archimedean spiral, right-handed in the right foot, about which subtalar motion occurs. So, during subtalar inversion, the calcaneus also rotates clockwise and translates forward along the axis of the screw. \nAverage subtalar motion is 20-30 degrees inversion and 5-10 degrees eversion. Functional motion during the gait cycle is 10-15 degrees (the heel strikes the ground in slight inversion followed by quick eversion).\nThe talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints (i.e. between the talus and navicular bones, and the calcaneus and cuboid bones) form the so-called transverse tarsal joint or Chopart's joint. It has two axes of motion. \nInversion and eversion occur about a longitudinal axis oriented 15 degrees upward from the horizontal plane and 9 degrees medially from the longitudinal axis of the foot. \nFlexion and extension occur primarily about an oblique axis oriented 52 degrees upward from the horizontal plane and 57 degrees anteromedially (forward-inward). \n\"In vitro\" talonavicular motion is 7 degrees flexion-extension and 17 degrees pronation-supination; while calcaneocuboid motion is 2 degrees flexion-extension and 7 degrees pronation-supination.\nThe motions of the subtalar and transverse talar joints interact to make the foot either flexible or rigid. With the subtalar joint in eversion, the two joints of the transverse joint are parallel, which make movements in this joint possible. With the subtalar joint in inversion, the axes of the transverse joint are convergent, movements in this joint are thus locked and the midfoot rigid.\nOther animals.\nIn primitive tetrapods, such as \"Trematops\", the tarsus consists of three rows of bones. There are three proximal tarsals, the tibiale, intermedium, and fibulare, named for their points of articulation with the bones of the lower limb. These are followed by a second row of four bones, referred to as the centralia (singular: centrale), and then a row of five distal tarsals, each articulating with a single metatarsal. In the great majority of tetrapods, including all of those alive today, this simple pattern is modified by the loss and fusion of some of the bones.\nIn reptiles and mammals, there are normally just two proximal tarsals, the calcaneus (equivalent to the amphibian fibulare) and the talus (probably derived from a fusion of multiple bones). In mammals, including humans, the talus forms a hinge joint with the tibia, a feature especially well developed in the artiodactyls. The calcaneus is also modified, forming a heel for the attachment of the Achilles tendon. Neither of these adaptations is found in reptiles, which have a relatively simple structure to both bones.\nThe fifth distal tarsal disappears relatively early in evolution, with the remainder becoming the cuneiform and cuboid bones. Reptiles usually retain two centralia, while mammals typically have only one (the navicular).\nIn birds, the tarsus has disappeared, with the proximal tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment."

        "title": "Racquet and Tennis Club",
        "text": "The Racquet and Tennis Club, familiarly known as the R&amp;T, is a private social and athletic club at 370 Park Avenue, between East 52nd and 53rd Streets in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.\nHistory.\nThe Racquet Court Club opened in 1876 at 55 West 26th Street. It had two racquets courts, an indoor running track and two bowling alleys, but it did not have a tennis court. In 1890, it merged into the newly incorporated Racquet and Tennis Club, which planned to build a tennis court, moving the following year to a second, larger club house at 27 West 43rd Street (1891). This second club house had two racquets courts, one fives court and one court tennis court. The Club moved to its third, and current, home in 1918.\nBuilding.\nThe R&amp;T's current clubhouse was designed by William Symmes Richardson, a partner at McKim, Mead, and White. The facility was built on a parcel offered for lease by a member of the club, Robert Goelet. Richardson, who had primary design responsibility for Pennsylvania Station and the Hotel Pennsylvania, proposed an integrated Italian Renaissance style and his firm's proposal was presented to the membership for approval in April 1916. In addition to offering its members more spacious amenities, the move to Park Avenue afforded more consistent natural light for the skylit playing courts, as well a generally more desirable location. Construction began on December 20, 1916 and was completed on September 7, 1918. The builder was Mark Edlitz, and the estimated cost was $500,000. Board of Directors at this time included financier Ogden Mills and sportsman Harry Payne Whitney.\nThe resulting building is about 200 feet by 100 feet (30 m x 60 m) and five stories tall. The exterior is stone and brick over a structural steel frame. According to the original plans, the interior contained three dining rooms, a billiard room, library, lounge, gymnasium, swimming pool, five squash courts, two court tennis courts, and two racquets courts. Today, there are four singles squash courts, one hardball squash doubles court, one racquets court and two court tennis courts. The club's court facilities are considered among the finest in the world.\nThe structure is representative of the ornate private clubs constructed in New York City during the early 20th century. McKim, Mead and White had previously designed the Harvard Club of New York City, the Century Association and the University Club of New York. It performs an important architectural role on Park Avenue as a foil to the Seagram Building, directly across the avenue, and the Lever House, across 53rd Street, and other corporate structures in the glass-clad vocabulary of International Modernism.\nThe building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1979 and on July 21, 1983, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe club sold its air rights on Park Avenue to the developer of the Park Avenue Plaza skyscraper in 1978. The glass-clad skyscraper rises in the middle of the block, immediately behind the club.\nSquash.\nClub members and professionals are active in squash and the R &amp; T has hosted many national and international competitions. Members who have been U.S. Squash National Champions include Palmer Dixon, Lawrence Pool, Beekman Pool, Stephen Vehslage, Peter Briggs, Ralph Howe, John Reese, Jonathan Foster, Morris Clothier, Addison West, Whitten Morris, Michael Ferreira, Dylan Patterson, William Hartigan and Kyle Martino. Former Head Squash Professional Ben Gould was World Squash Doubles Champion in 2009 (with Paul Price), 2011 (with Damien Mudge) and 2013 (with Damien Mudge). Club members who have been elected into the Squash Hall of Fame include William \"Treddy\" Ketcham, Ralph Howe and Peter Briggs.\nThe first collegiate squash team match was played at the Racquet and Tennis Club on February 17, 1923. Harvard defeated Yale 4 matches to 1.\nCourt Tennis and Racquets.\nClub members and professionals have been national and world champions in both court tennis and racquets. The most famous was Pierre Etchebaster, who was Court Tennis World Champion from 1928 to 1954. Other R &amp; T Court Tennis World Champions include James Dear (1955-1957), Albert \"Jack\" Johnson (1957-1959), Northrup Knox (1959-1969), Pete Bostwick (1969-1972), Jimmy Bostwick (1972-1976) and Wayne Davies (1987-1994). R &amp; T members who have won multiple U.S. Amateur Court Tennis Championships include Jimmy Van Alen, Ogden Phipps, Alastair Martin, Gene Scott and Morris Clothier. Club member Willie Surtees and Club professionals Neil Smith and James Dear were World Racquets Champions. Tim Chisholm, Head Professional from 1999 to 2004, was World Court Tennis Doubles Champion in 2001 (with Julian Snow). James Stout, who has been a professional at the Club since 2006, was World Racquets Champion from 2008 to 2019 and is currently Head Racquets and Squash Professional.\nBackgammon.\nThe Racquet and Tennis Club played an important role in the history of backgammon: In 1931 Wheaton Vaughan, who was then chairman of the club's \"Card and Backgammon Committee\", invited representatives of selected New York City clubs and elsewhere and led the process to formulate and produce the \"Laws of Backgammon\". This set of rules is the basis of the rules according to which backgammon is played today and was published by Charles Scribner's Sons. Backgammon remains a vibrant game in the Club.\nMembership.\nLike other single gender Manhattan clubs including the Colony (women-only), the Cosmopolitan (women-only), and the Knickerbocker (men-only), the R &amp; T has maintained its men-only membership policy. Women are welcome at the Club for social and athletic events. In 1987, the Club did not allow an exemption for the Women's Court Tennis Championship, citing its membership rules.\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources"

        "title": "The Play (American football)",
        "text": "\"The Play\" was a last-second, game-winning kickoff return for a touchdown that occurred during a college football game between the Stanford Cardinal and California Golden Bears on Saturday, November 20, 1982. Given the circumstances and rivalry, the wild game that preceded it, the very unusual way in which \"The Play\" unfolded, and its lingering aftermath on players and fans, it is recognized as one of the most memorable plays in college football history and among the most memorable in American sports.\nStanford had taken a 20–19 lead on a field goal with four seconds left. The Golden Bears used five lateral passes on the ensuing kickoff return to score the winning touchdown in the game's final seconds and earn a 25–20 victory. Believing that the game was over, members of the Stanford Band came onto the field midway through the return, which added to the confusion and folklore. There remains disagreement over the legality of two of Cal's backward pass attempts, adding to the passion surrounding the traditional rivalry of the annual \"Big Game.\"\nBackground.\nThis was the two teams' 85th Big Game, and was played on Cal's home field, California Memorial Stadium. Although Cal was guaranteed a winning record (with bowl eligibility) for the season, no bowl game was looking to invite them. The implications of this game were far more important to Stanford, led by quarterback John Elway, who was playing in his last regular-season college game before heading to the National Football League. The Cardinal were in the midst of an exciting season—they were 5–5 but had victories over highly ranked Ohio State and Washington—and needed one more win to be eligible for a bowl game. Representatives of the Hall of Fame Classic committee were in attendance, apparently to extend an invitation to Stanford to play Vanderbilt if the Cardinal won.\nAlso at stake was possession of the Stanford Axe, an axe-head trophy that is awarded to the winner of this annual matchup. Its origin dates back to 1899, but in 1933, after years of increasingly more elaborate thefts of the Axe by students from one or the other school, the two schools agreed that the winner of the Big Game would take possession of the Axe. The plaque upon which the Axe is mounted carries the score of previous Big Games.\nGame summary.\nCal took a 10–0 lead at the half on a field goal (after having one blocked on its first drive) and a two-play, 55-yard touchdown drive that consisted of long passes from Gale Gilbert to Mariet Ford, including a diving catch by Ford in the end zone.\nCal missed another field goal on its first drive of the second half, which was answered by an 80-yard touchdown drive by Stanford for the Cardinal's first score. The drive included a controversial catch by Mike Tolliver, who appeared to have been out of bounds, and was capped by back-to-back passes from John Elway to running back Vincent White.\nStanford took its first lead of the game, 14–10, on another touchdown reception by White, but relinquished the lead after a Cal field goal and touchdown pass from Gilbert to Wes Howell to make the score 19–14 Cal.\nA failed two-point conversion by Cal after their latest touchdown loomed large, when Stanford subsequently cut the Cal lead to 19–17 on a field goal and was thus just another field goal away from re-taking the lead.\nAfter losing the ball on a fumble on its next possession, Stanford got the ball back on its own 20-yard line with 1:27 left. At that point, the lead had changed twice in the second half and would do so two more times in the game's final moments.\nThe situation.\nWith Cal leading 19–17 late in the fourth quarter, Elway and the Cardinal had one final chance to score the go-ahead points. Needing just a field goal to win, Elway overcame an early fourth and long deep in Stanford territory and got the Cardinal to the Golden Bears' 23-yard line. With eight seconds remaining, Stanford kicker Mark Harmon hit a field goal to give the Cardinal a 20–19 lead.\nHowever, two things happened that would play into what would follow. Elway had been instructed by head coach Paul Wiggin to call timeout with eight seconds left to give his team two chances to kick in case the snap was botched on the attempt; if he had waited an additional four seconds to call the timeout, Harmon's kick would have been the final play of the game and Stanford would have won. Not only that, but Stanford was called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after the play, so not only would they have to kick it back to Cal, but from 15 yards farther back than normal. Because Harmon was likely to execute a squib kick on the ensuing kickoff, Cal would not have as great a distance to cover once the kick was fielded. \nStill, with only four seconds left on the clock, the Golden Bears would almost certainly need to score a touchdown on the ensuing kickoff to win barring any defensive penalty; Cal radio announcer Joe Starkey remarked on KGO radio that \"only a miracle\" would help. As the teams got ready for the kickoff, Cal defensive back Richard Rodgers told the rest of the special teams players, \"Don't get tackled with the ball.\" \nCal rushed onto the field without 11 players on their special teams unit, which defensive back and return man Kevin Moen spotted right away. When he noticed this, he moved a few yards away from his normal position. As was expected, Harmon executed the squib kick. The ball bounced right to Moen, who fielded it at the Cal 45. \nHere is the sequence that followed. \nThe Cal players celebrated wildly—but the officials had not signaled the touchdown. Stanford coach Paul Wiggin and his players argued to the officials that Dwight Garner's knee had been down, negating what had happened during the rest of the play. Meanwhile, the officials huddled. The chaos at the end of The Play made the officials' task very challenging. In particular, the questionable fifth lateral took place in the midst of the Stanford band, greatly reducing visibility. Referee Charles Moffett recalled the moment:\nMoffett signaled the touchdown, rendering the illegal participation penalty on Stanford irrelevant and ending the game, making the final score 25–20 in favor of Cal.\nControversy.\nThe officials' ruling of a Cal touchdown was highly controversial at the time, and The Play has remained a source of often intense disagreement throughout the intervening decades, particularly between ardent Stanford and Cal fans. The controversy centers on the legality of two of the five laterals as well as on the chaos that ensued when the Stanford team and band entered the playing field while the ball was still live.\nMany Stanford players and coaches objected immediately to the third lateral, from Dwight Garner to Richard Rodgers, asserting that Garner's knee was down moments beforehand. Kevin Lamar, a Stanford player who was in on the tackle, maintains that Garner's knee had hit the turf while he was still in possession of the ball; Garner and Rodgers themselves, however, assert the opposite. TV replays were inconclusive; due to the distance from the camera and the swarm of tacklers, one cannot see the exact moment Garner's knee may have touched.\nAfterward, upon viewing the game footage, many suggested that the fifth lateral from Mariet Ford to Kevin Moen had been an illegal forward pass. Ford was about to be tackled at about the 27.5-yard-line when he released his blind, over-the-shoulder heave, which Moen appeared to catch while crossing the 25. Because both players were in full stride, and because the lateral traveled some distance from the 27.5 to the 25-yard line, the ball had actually gone forward. Under the rules of football, the direction of a pass is judged relative to the field. Confusing the referees on the spot, however, was the fact that Ford tossed the ball back over his shoulder while falling forward, while Moen reached backwards to catch it, thus making it difficult for the referees to realize that the ball itself traveled forward, not sideways or backward. It is an illegal forward pass, however, if the ball travels forward (here, from the 27.5 to the 25 yard line); the thrower’s and receiver’s body motions (Ford tossing ball back over his shoulder, and Moen reaching backwards) are irrelevant. \nFinally, while the replay of the tackle of Garner is not conclusive, Stanford was clearly guilty of illegal participation, both from too many players on the field and the band. At least two game officials immediately threw penalty flags on Stanford for having too many men on the field. A football game cannot end on a defensive penalty (unless declined), so had any of the Cal ball carriers been tackled short of the end zone, Cal would have had at least one unclocked play from scrimmage, and perhaps a touchdown outright for outside interference. The game referee, Charles Moffett, noted this as a likely outcome in a subsequent interview (see above). Rule 9-1, Article 4 of the official NCAA football rules, \"Illegal Interference\", allows the referee to award a score if \"equitable\" after an act of interference. For example, officials in the 1954 Cotton Bowl Classic awarded a touchdown to Rice after Alabama fullback Tommy Lewis jumped onto the field from the sideline to tackle Rice running back Dickey Maegle as he was running toward a touchdown.\nThe NCAA's instant replay rules were not adopted until 2005, more than two decades later, so the officials could not consult recorded television footage to resolve these issues. It is unclear whether instant replay would have had any impact, as a field ruling cannot be overturned unless there is \"indisputable video evidence\" to the contrary. \nAnalysis of the controversy.\nMany attempts have been made to analyze the disputed areas of The Play and resolve its controversies. This has proven to be a difficult task for several reasons. Only one television replay is available, and it is from a distant and elevated midfield camera. The rules of college football do not precisely cover The Play's bizarre final seconds. Finally, the intense passion from both Cal and Stanford fans often make objective analysis of The Play a great challenge.\nAmong the notable attempts at deconstructing The Play are:\nAftermath.\nFour days after the game, students at \"The Stanford Daily\" published a bogus version of Cal's student newspaper, \"The Daily Californian\", with the lead story claiming that the NCAA had declared Cal's last play to be dead in a ruling three days after the game. According to that bogus paper, the official score would be recorded in the NCAA record books as Stanford 20, California 19. The Stanford students then distributed 7,000 copies of the phony \"extra\" on the Cal campus. A few days later, blue and gold t-shirts depicting the play with Xs and Os (much like a coach's diagram) complete with squiggly lines for the laterals, appeared in the Cal bookstore and throughout the Bay Area.\nThe season after The Play, Stanford went 1–10 and Paul Wiggin was fired. Wiggin later said The Play \"had a big effect on our program, especially on recruiting.\" Athletics director Andy Geiger said the loss devastated the program. Others blamed the loss on the Stanford Band. Of the band's role, Geiger said, \"Although the Band did not cause the Play, it was typical that they would have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" The incumbent Stanford band manager now annually passes his or her position to the new manager with 4 seconds left in the Stanford–Cal game.\nWhenever Stanford holds the Stanford Axe, the plaque is altered in protest so that the outcome reads as a 20–19 Stanford victory. When the Axe is returned to Cal's possession, the plaque is changed back to the official score: California 25, Stanford 20.\nFor many years, John Elway was bitter, on both a personal level and on behalf of his team, about the touchdown being allowed: \"This was an insult to college football... They [the officials] ruined my last game as a college football player.\" The Play cost Stanford an invitation to the Hall of Fame Classic, in addition to a winning season, and Elway completed his college career having never played in a bowl game. Geiger said that the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy. Elway would nevertheless enjoy a tremendously successful NFL career, winning two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos, and was inducted into the Pro Football and College Football Halls of Fame. Years later, Elway came to terms with The Play, stating that \"each year it gets a little funnier.\"\nThe participants in The Play faded into relative obscurity in the years since, with the only memorable participants in the game being Elway and announcer Joe Starkey for his famous call of The Play.\nRon Rivera, a starting linebacker for California, went on to play for the 1985 Chicago Bears who went 15–1 during the regular season and won Super Bowl XX. He has since been a head coach for the Carolina Panthers and Washington Commanders of the NFL, and was named NFL Coach of the Year in 2013 and 2015.\nEmile Harry, Stanford wide receiver, after graduating '85, was drafted with the 89th pick by the Atlanta Falcons, then went on to play 8 seasons for the Kansas City Chiefs.\nGary Plummer, a linebacker for the Golden Bears, was drafted into the United States Football League in 1983. He played 8 seasons with the San Diego Chargers before joining the San Francisco 49ers in 1994, as part of their Super Bowl XXIX winning team. Plummer retired from the NFL after the 1997 season.\nThe most infamous participant in The Play is Mariet Ford, who also caught 7 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown in the game. Ford, who briefly played wide receiver for the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League, was convicted of murdering his pregnant wife and 3-year-old son in 1997. He is serving a 45 years-to-life sentence.\nKevin Moen had a short-lived professional career and is now a real estate broker in the Los Angeles area. In 2002, he coached the Palos Verdes Colts, a Pop Warner football team. He was also the head football coach at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, starting in the 2008–2009 school year until 2011-12. A statue of Moen catching the ball was unveiled in 2022 outside of California Memorial Stadium.\nGary Tyrrell, the Stanford trombonist run over by Moen, is a venture capital firm CFO and amateur brewer. He became friends with Moen and Cal coach Joe Kapp. He appeared on television's \"The Tonight Show\" along with the key Cal players shortly after The Play; his smashed trombone is now displayed in the College Football Hall of Fame. He has also said, \"I thought I'd be famous for my talent as a musician, not for being knocked down at a football game.\"\nDwight Garner, who later spent two years with the Washington Redskins and retired, was a risk manager with Interim Healthcare. He died of prostate cancer at the age of 58 on November 18, 2022, one day before the 125th Big Game, during which Cal commemorated the 40th anniversary of The Play.\nRichard Rodgers Sr. played in the CFL and is now an assistant coach in the NFL. His son Richard Rodgers II, who also played for Cal, became a tight end for the Green Bay Packers in 2014. On December 3, 2015, the younger Rodgers had heroics of his own, catching a Hail Mary from Cal alum Aaron Rodgers with no time left to help them beat the Detroit Lions 27–23. The Hail Mary was quickly coined as \"The Miracle in Motown\". After the game Richard Rodgers II admitted thinking about The Play his father was part of, stating \"It's a really special moment for him and I was kind of thinking on the play before, when Aaron got the facemask, I was kind of thinking we would do something like that. Obviously it turned out differently.\"\nGale Gilbert was the starting quarterback for the Cal Bears. Gilbert is the only player in NFL history to be a member of five straight Super Bowl teams. His son, Garrett Gilbert, was the starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns, and later for the Dallas Cowboys.\nJohn Tuggle was California's starting fullback in the game. He finished with 28 carries for 97 yards, a performance that was largely overshadowed by \"The Play\". After this, he went on to earn the Mr. Irrelevant award by being selected by the New York Giants with the last pick of the 1983 NFL draft. Tuggle played most of the 1983 season on special teams, but was promoted to starting fullback in week 12 when Rob Carpenter went down with an injury. He finished the season with 17 carries for 49 yards and a touchdown, three receptions for 50 yards, and 9 kickoff returns for 156 yards. At the end of the season, his teammates voted him special teams player of the year. In 1984, Tuggle was diagnosed with cancer. He never played another NFL game and died on August 30, 1986.\nAfter the game Kapp proclaimed, \"The Bear would not quit, the Bear would not die.\" The phrase became the motto of the Cal team under Kapp.\nRankings.\nBased on online voting, Pontiac announced the California v. Stanford game of Nov. 20, 1982, as its \"Ultimate High-Performance Play of the NCAA,\" crowning the play as \"NCAA Football's most memorable moment of all-time\" in December 2003.\nThe game was placed in NCAA Football video games as a \"College Classic,\" challenging players to recreate the ending. The challenge begins with the player controlling the Bears as the Cardinal kick the field goal leading up to the final kickoff.\nJoe Starkey's call.\nCal announcer Joe Starkey of KGO-AM 810 radio called the game. The following is a transcript of his famous call:\nThe portion of the call during the officials' deliberation is often edited out when the clip is replayed, making it seem as though Starkey declared Cal the victors immediately after the run.\nMusic City Miracle (2000).\nSimilar to The Play, the \"Music City Miracle\" was a kickoff return with a controversial lateral that resulted in a game-winning touchdown. In an NFL between the Tennessee Titans and the Buffalo Bills at the venue now known as Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, the Bills took a 16–15 lead on a 41-yard field goal by Steve Christie with 16 seconds remaining. The ensuing kickoff was fielded by the Titans' Lorenzo Neal, who handed the ball off to Frank Wycheck. Faced with oncoming defenders, Wycheck turned to his left and passed the ball across the field to Kevin Dyson, who was protected by a wall of blockers. Dyson ran untouched 75 yards down the sideline to score a touchdown. Unlike The Play, NFL rules in 2000 allowed for a replay official to call for video review of any questionable on-field call in the final two minutes of a game, and such a review was immediately declared to determine if Wycheck's pass to Dyson was an illegal forward pass. After a lengthy delay, officials determined that video evidence was inconclusive to overturn the ruling on the field, and the play was upheld as a touchdown. Although there were 3 seconds left on the clock when Dyson scored, nothing came of the Bills' ensuing kickoff return and the Titans went on to win the game 22–16. Later, computer analysis established that Dyson caught the ball on the same yard marker that Wycheck threw it from, confirming that the pass was indeed a lateral.\nOn ABC's television broadcast of the game, color commentator Joe Theismann said immediately after the score, in an obvious reference to The Play, \"All that's missing is the band. That's the only thing missing.\""

        "title": "1992 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1992 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1991–92 season, and the culmination of the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested by the Prince of Wales Conference and defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins and the Clarence Campbell Conference champion Chicago Blackhawks. The Blackhawks were appearing in their first Finals since . After the Blackhawks jumped to an early 4–1 lead in the first game of the series, Mario Lemieux and the Penguins came back to win the game, sweep the series in four games, and win their second consecutive and second overall Stanley Cup. The fourth and final game of this series was the first time a Stanley Cup playoff game was played in the month of June and at the time it was the latest finishing date for an NHL season. This was also the last Finals to be played at Chicago Stadium as it closed in 1994.\nPaths to the Finals.\nPittsburgh defeated the Washington Capitals 4–3, the Presidents' Trophy winning New York Rangers 4–2, and the Boston Bruins 4–0.\nChicago had to defeat their three biggest rivals, first the St. Louis Blues 4–2, then their long-time Original Six rival Detroit Red Wings 4–0, and then, the Edmonton Oilers 4–0.\nWith their co-tenants at Chicago Stadium, the Bulls, coached by Phil Jackson and led by Michael Jordan, playing in (and winning) the NBA Finals, it was an opportunity for both the Blackhawks and the Bulls to help the city of Chicago become the first city to have both NHL and NBA championships in the same year. (New York also had this opportunity in 1994, when the Knicks and Rangers made the finals in their respective sport; however, the result was the same, albeit a reversal of Chicago's ending, as the Rangers won their first Stanley Cup since 1940, and the Knicks lost, with both of those series going the full seven games.)\nChicago set an NHL playoff record in winning 11 games in a row to reach the finals.\nPittsburgh had won seven in a row entering the finals and swept Chicago in four games to tie Chicago's record. Pittsburgh then extended the playoff winning streak record to 14 with wins in the first three games against the New Jersey Devils in the following season's first playoff round.\nBoth teams finished the regular season with 87 points. The Penguins earned home-ice advantage by virtue of having 39 wins to the Blackhawks' 36.\nGame summaries.\nThe Penguins were led by captain Mario Lemieux, coach Scotty Bowman, and goaltender Tom Barrasso. The Blackhawks were led by captain Dirk Graham, head coach Mike Keenan and goaltender Ed Belfour. They also made history in having the first Russian-born player to have a chance to get their name on the Stanley Cup in Igor Kravchuk.\nMario Lemieux won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP for the second consecutive year, becoming only the second player in NHL history to do so: Bernie Parent had won it when the Philadelphia Flyers won the Cup in the consecutive years of and .\nGame one.\nIn the opening game of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals, the Pittsburgh Penguins overcame deficits of 3–0 in the first period and 4–1 halfway through the second period to win by a score of 5–4. This was the first victory from a three-goal deficit in the Finals since 1944\nSix minutes into the game, the Blackhawks' forecheck drew a penalty against Pittsburgh. Right off the subsequent face-off, Chris Chelios scored the first goal of the Stanley Cup Finals on a wrist shot. After surviving a Pittsburgh powerplay, the Blackhawks' aggressive offensive-zone strategy would lead to two more Blackhawks goals within a 26-second window. First, Michel Goulet converted a takeaway on the boards in the Penguins' zone to make it 2–0, then Dirk Graham scored on a rebound with the shot by Chelios. Pittsburgh got on the board after Igor Kravchuk got penalized for holding and Phil Bourque scored on a wraparound after Blackhawks goalkeeper Ed Belfour lost his stick. Chicago subsequently extended their lead to 4–1 via a two-on-one breakaway from Steve Larmer to Brent Sutter, who beat Tom Barrasso under his left leg. Just as their powerplay from Chicago's too-many-men penalty expired, Rick Tocchet deflected a shot from Paul Stanton into the Chicago net. Then, on the Penguins' next rush, Kevin Stevens drew several Blackhawks on him, which gave Mario Lemieux room to bank the puck off the Ed Belfour's leg, decreasing the deficit to 4–3. After fifteen minutes in the third, the Penguins would equalize the score. Aided by a pick on a Pittsburgh defender by Shawn McEachern, Jaromir Jagr deked around three Blackhawks, charging into the crease starting from the boards, and beat Belfour on a backhand shot to tie the game at 4–4 with 4:55 remaining in the third period. After both Mike Hudson for the Blackhawks and Lemieux for the Penguins drew penalties while charging the offensive zone against two opposing defenders, almost exactly two minutes apart, the game seemed poised to go into overtime with Pittsburgh playing with a one-man advantage. However, on an offensive-zone face-off to start the Pittsburgh powerplay, Mario Lemieux charged the Blackhawks' net from the weak side and put a rebound off a shot by Larry Murphy past Belfour. Pittsburgh's first lead of the game thus came with thirteen seconds remaining in the game. The Penguins held off the Blackhawks to win game one, 5–4.\nGame two.\nIn game two, nearly ten minutes into the game, Bob Errey scored the first goal for Pittsburgh shorthanded. In the second period, after denying Lemieux his scoring chance, Bryan Marchment trailed the subsequent play into the Pittsburgh zone and then won a physical battle against Larry Murphy. On a seemingly broken play he put the puck past Tom Barrasso into the Pittsburgh goal to tie the game at 1–1. However, Marchment was called for an elbow check and Mario Lemieux scored on a one timer set up by Rick Tocchet, 43 seconds into the ensuing powerplay. Two-and-a-half minutes later, Brian Marchment, who had been the catalyst for Chicago's lone goal, was beaten on the boards by Rick Tocchet. Tocchet again fed Lemieux in the slot, and another one timer extended the Pittsburgh lead to 3–1. The Penguins then limited the Blackhawks shots to four in the third period to take Game 2 3–1.\nGame three.\nIn game three, the Blackhawks put up more offensive pressure on the Penguins. Pittsburgh instead shut out the Blackhawks, with Tom Barrasso stopping all 27 shots in the three periods. The lone goal came from Kevin Stevens putting his team into a 3–0 series lead.\nGame four.\nAfter the series saw a total of just one goal over the course of 86 minutes of hockey spanning from the second period of game two to the early moments of game four, the two teams erupted for an eleven-goal outburst in game four, which was the first NHL game played in the month of June. There were four goals scored in the first seven minutes of the game, and five in the first eleven, with the first period ending with a score of 3–3. The lasting image of the opening stanza was perhaps the sea of hats on the ice after Blackhawks captain Dirk Graham recorded a hat trick by accounting for all three of Chicago's goals. Pittsburgh's goals were scored by Jaromir Jagr after Ed Belfour turned over the puck behind his goal; by Kevin Stevens on a one-handed backhand wrist shot that was deemed \"stoppable\" by TV analyst Bill Clement (and sparked the change in goal); and by Mario Lemieux on a rebound off a shot from Larry Murphy, which had been set up by Lemieux. Graham scored his hat trick to answer each of these goals on a rebound off his own backhand shot and two one-timers after he was left alone at the Pittsburgh crease in both instances. There were two goals scored in the second period – one on each side – to make the score 4–4. Pittsburgh's tally came just 58 seconds into the period, when Rick Tocchet was left alone after the Blackhawks neglected to defend the area near the crease. With less than five minutes to go in the second period, the Blackhawks immediately scored a goal to tie the game for the fourth time, when Jeremy Roenick deflected a shot by Brian Noonan off Murphy's leg. The proverbial floodgates would, however, open almost exactly five minutes into the final period, when the Penguins scored twice in just over three minutes. At first, a shoulder check by Mario Lemieux against Chris Chelios behind the Chicago goal set up a wrist shot by Larry Murphy through traffic, which went past Hasek for a 5–4 Pittsburgh lead. Then Ron Francis converted a slapshot in a two-on-one situation to give Pittsburgh its first two-goal lead of the game. Chicago would come closer once more, when Jeremy Roenick scored at the 11:18 mark to make it 6–5 Pittsburgh after Larry Murphy tripped behind his own goal, just over three minutes after the second Pittsburgh goal of the period. Just a minute later, Chris Chelios hit the goal post, and the Roenick-Chelios pair would also sustain pressure in the final minute of the game with Chicago playing with an empty net. Overall however, Pittsburgh still controlled most stretches of these final eight minutes, as they didn't have trouble getting out of their zone. Pittsburgh finished the game 6–5 earning their second Stanley Cup. Mario Lemieux was given the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on the CBC and in French on SRC.\nIn the United States, this was the last Stanley Cup Finals to air nationally on SportsChannel America. ESPN would pick up the national U.S. contract for the next season.\nSportsChannel America's national coverage was blacked out in the Chicago and Pittsburgh areas due to the local rights to Blackhawks and Penguins games in those respective TV markets. SportsChannel Chicago aired the games in Chicago. In Pittsburgh, KBL televised games one and two while KDKA aired games three and four.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1992 Stanley Cup was presented to Penguins captain Mario Lemieux by NHL President John Ziegler following the Penguins 6–5 win over the Blackhawks in game four. It was the last of 15 Stanley Cup presentations presided over by Ziegler; this duty passed to Commissioner Gary Bettman the next season. \nThe following Penguins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1991–92 Pittsburgh Penguins\nAftermath.\nThe Penguins won a league record 17-straight games en route to the Presidents' Trophy in the season, despite Mario Lemieux missing much of the season to Hodgkin's lymphoma. Their chances at a three-peat ended when they lost in the Patrick Division final to the New York Islanders in seven games. The Penguins wouldn't return to the finals again until 2008, when they lost to the Detroit Red Wings.\nThe Blackhawks, however, got swept in the first round to the St. Louis Blues, 4–0. The Blackhawks would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until 2010, when they defeated the Penguins' cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, in six games."

        "title": "Mumbai cricket team",
        "text": "The Mumbai cricket team, formerly known as the Bombay Cricket Team, is a cricket team which represents Mumbai in Indian domestic cricket. It is governed by Mumbai Cricket Association. Its home ground is Wankhede Stadium in Churchgate.\nThe team also plays its home matches at Bandra Kurla Complex Ground and Brabourne Stadium. The team comes under the West Zone designation. It was formerly known as the Bombay cricket team, but changed its name when the city was renamed from Bombay to Mumbai.\nMumbai is the most successful team in the history of Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic cricket competition, with 42 titles. Its most recent title was in 2023–24. It also has won 14 (and 1 shared) Irani Cups.\nMumbai has produced some of the greatest Indian cricketers of all time such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Rohit Sharma, Vijay Merchant, Polly Umrigar and Dilip Vengsarkar.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded cricket match in Mumbai took place between a Military XI and an Island XI in 1797. The affluent Parsis of Mumbai founded the short-lived Orient Cricket Club in 1848. In 1850, the Young Zoroastrian Club, which exists to this day was founded. In 1866, the Bombay Union Hindu Club, a forerunner of the Hindu Gymkhana was founded. In 1884, Sir Dorabji Tata formed the Parsi Gymkhana and helped an all-Parsi team tour England in 1886. Despite a cricketing failure, the Parsis organised another tour of England in 1888.\nIn 1889-90, an English team managed by George Vernon and captained by Lord Hawke played against the Bombay Gymkhana and the Parsis at the Gymkhana Ground during their tour of Ceylon and India. The Parsis pulled off a famous victory, a first for an Indian team against English opposition.\nThe Bombay Tournament, patronised by the Governor of Bombay Lord Harris, was played between the Parsis and Europeans, alternately in Bombay and Poona from 1892 to 1906. The 1892 match was the first First-class cricket match to be played in India. In 1906, Hindus played Parsis to create the Bombay Triangular. in 1912, the Muslims of the Mohammeden Gymkhana were invited to play and create the famous Bombay Quadrangular. In 1937, a fifth team, called The Rest, was admitted to the tournament. It comprised Buddhists, Jews, and Indian Christians. In 1946 that the Pentangular tournament was abandoned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India and replaced by a zonal competition. The Ranji Trophy, in which regional teams from all over India competed, became the pre-eminent Indian cricket competition.\nThe Quadrangular Committee, consisting of the four Gymkhanas in Bombay, met to 6 August 1928 to discuss the formation of a single governing entity for cricket in the Bombay Presidency outside Sind. On 6 October 1928, 'The Bombay Presidency (Proper) Cricket Association' was adopted as the name of the governing body and clubs began to be enrolled as members. On 16 August 1934, the Gujarat Cricket Association and the Maharashtra Cricket Association approached the Board of Control for Cricket in India for direct affiliation, separating from The Bombay Presidency (Proper) Cricket Association. The rump organisation then adopted the name Bombay Cricket Association, with its jurisdiction limited to the 'Greater Bombay and Thana District'.\nRanji Trophy.\nEarly success.\nBombay won the first-ever Ranji Trophy competition in 1934–35, with Vijay Merchant starring in the final against Northern India. They retained title the following season with victory over Madras in the final. Bombay quickly showed themselves to be one of the strongest teams in the competition with 7 victories in the first 20 seasons of the Ranji Trophy. When playing Maharashtra in a semi-final of the 1948–49 season at Pune, Mumbai became the first and only team in first-class history to score over 600 runs in both innings of the same match – 651 and 714.\n1950s-1970s dominance.\nHowever, it was only after this period of success that their dominance was at its zenith. Bombay won 20 out of 22 titles from 1955–56 to 1976–77, including 15 consecutive titles from 1958–59 to 1972–73. Bombay continued to regularly reach the Ranji Trophy final up to the mid-1980s.\n1980s struggles.\nThe latter half of the 1980s was Bombay's least successful period with no final appearances in 5 consecutive seasons.\n1990s resurgence.\nHowever, they were able to regain some of their former glory from the 1990s onwards winning an additional 6 Ranji Trophies from 1993–94 to 2003–04.\n21st century.\nIn 2006–07, Mumbai won their 37th Ranji Trophy with victory over Bengal in the final at Wankhede Stadium. This win was particularly memorable as the team had recovered from the setbacks of losing their first three games and is reduced to 0/5 in the semi-final against Baroda.\nMumbai's dominance of the Ranji Trophy has led to many consecutive appearances in the Irani Trophy with much success including 15 wins from 29 appearances. However, they have failed to beat Rest of India since the 1997–98 Irani Cup.\nGrounds.\nBrabourne Stadium.\nThe Governor of Bombay Lord Brabourne granted the Cricket Club of India land to build a new stadium. The foundation stone was laid by Lord Brabourne on 22 May 1936. The first match was played on the incomplete ground in October 1937 between the CCI and the Spencer Cup XI. The ground was opened on 7 December 1937 by Roger Lumley, Governor of Bombay. The ground was named after Brabourne at the suggestion of the Maharaja of Patiala.\nThe Mumbai cricket team played its home matches at the Brabourne Stadium until 1971, when a dispute between CCI president Vijay Merchant and the Bombay Cricket Association over the allocation of seats for England's 1972-73 tour of India prompted the construction of the Wankhede Stadium.\nWankhede Stadium.\nThe Mumbai cricket team has played at the Wankhede Stadium since its construction in 1974. In the 1984–85 Ranji Trophy match against Baroda, Mumbai's Ravi Shastri hit six sixes in an over off Tilak Raj, en-route to the fastest double century in first-class cricket at the time.\nBandra Kurla Complex Ground.\nThe Mumbai Cricket Association built the MCA Recreation Centre at the Bandra Kurla Complex Ground in 2007. It houses an indoor cricket school and a cricket ground where Ranji Trophy matches are played.\nNotable players.\nThe team is known for its batting and spin bowling and has produced many of the Indian cricket team's top batsmen over the years.

        "title": "Timeline of golf (2000–present)",
        "text": "The following is a partial timeline of the history of golf.\n2000.\nMen's golf.\nTiger Woods recorded the most dominant season in history by any player. He won 11 of the 25 events he entered worldwide, including three major championships, breaking all-time scoring records at each. His season-long scoring average was 68.11, breaking an all-time record most thought would never be beaten, set by Byron Nelson in 1945 (68.33). It was calculated that his lead in the (24-month) world rankings at the end of 2000 was so great that he could take 2001 off altogether, and still be world number one at the end of that year. \n2001.\nMen's golf.\nTiger Woods completes what becomes known as the \"Tiger Slam\", holding off David Duval and Phil Mickelson to win the Masters Championship in April to become the first golfer in history to hold, concurrently, all four professional major championships. For good measure, Woods had won the game's fifth most important event, the Tournament Players' Championship as well, in March.\nBy the end of the year, however, Woods would have relinquished three of his titles, on each occasion to players winning their first major title. At the U.S. Open, South African Retief Goosen finally emerged triumphant from a playoff with Mark Brooks, after three-putting from 12 feet on the 72nd hole the previous day knowing that he had two putts for victory. Playing partner Stewart Cink also missed an 18-inch putt of his own at the last hole that, as events turned out, would have allowed him to join the playoff.\nThe Open Championship is won by David Duval, whose third round of 65 turns the final day into something of a victory progression. Unknown Swedish player Niclas Fasth finishes second, playing his way into Europe's Ryder Cup side ahead of Ian Woosnam, who incurs a two-shot penalty after his caddie realises he is carrying 15 clubs. Then in August, the PGA Championship goes to David Toms as Phil Mickelson again finished runner-up in a major championship. Toms' 72-hole total of 265 is the best ever recorded in a major championship (though not the best in relation to par, even at the PGA Championship).\nFollowing the terrible events of 9/11, the Ryder Cup is postponed for twelve months, and it is agreed that the event would continue to be played in even years from that point forward. The terrorist attacks force several leading American players to revise plans to compete in the World Matchplay Championship in England in October. 43-year-old former champion Ian Woosnam, who had suffered such an unusual fate at the Open, is brought in as a replacement, and beats Goosen, Colin Montgomerie and Pádraig Harrington to win the event for a third time.\n2002.\nMen's golf.\nTiger Woods enjoys another supremely dominant season. He wins both The Masters and the U.S. Open by three shots (from Retief Goosen and Phil Mickelson, respectively), becoming only the fifth player in history to win both in the same season. His opportunity for a single-season Grand Slam, however, is literally blown away on Saturday at The Open Championship, as the worst of the Muirfield weather closes in and Woods hits 81. Colin Montgomerie, who had shot 64 the previous day, shoots 84 in similar conditions. Ernie Els plays brilliantly given the conditions to record a 72, and wins after a 4-man playoff, the first in major championship history, involving Steve Elkington, Stuart Appleby and Frenchman Thomas Levet.\nWoods then surprisingly misses out at the PGA Championship, when unheralded Rich Beem does enough to hold on to a one-shot lead over Tiger over the closing holes, after Justin Leonard loses his third-round lead.\n2004.\n\"For brief details see 2004 in sports#Golf and for fuller details see 2004 in golf.\"\n2005.\n\"For brief details see 2005 in sports#Golf and for fuller details see 2005 in golf.\"\n2006.\n\"For brief details see 2006 in sports#Golf and for fuller details see 2006 in golf.\"\n2007.\n\"For brief details see 2007 in sports#Golf and for fuller details see 2007 in golf.\"\n2008.\n\"For brief details see 2008 in sports#Golf and for fuller details see 2008 in golf.\"\n2009.\n\"For brief details see 2009 in sports#Golf and for fuller details see 2009 in golf.\""

        "title": "Golden Baseball League",
        "text": "The Golden Baseball League was an independent baseball league based in San Ramon, California, with teams located in the western United States, western Canada and northwest Mexico.\nThe GBL was not affiliated with Major League Baseball or the organized Minor League Baseball system, but has featured players with MLB experience (Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco, Alex Arias, Bud Smith, Desi Wilson, José Lima, Hideki Irabu, Junior Spivey, Mark Prior). It was formed in 2004 and began play on May 26, 2005.\nThe GBL's presenting partner was Safeway Inc. Other investors in the GBL included \"Wheel of Fortune\" host Pat Sajak, former National Football League players Mike Sherrard and Christian Okoye, and executives from Cisco Systems, Taleo and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.\nOver 100 players were sold to MLB organizations after it began play, with seven players already making it to a major league uniform – Dane De La Rosa, Adam Pettyjohn, Scott Richmond, Chris Jakubauskas, Sergio Romo, Bobby Cramer, and Daniel Nava.\nThe Golden Baseball League combined with United League Baseball and the Northern League into a new North American League for the 2011 season to form the first nationwide independent professional baseball league. However, the North American League folded after two seasons.\nHistory.\nThe league was founded in 2004 by Stanford University graduates Dave Kaval and Amit Patel. Kaval was the president and chief executive officer (Patel departed after the 2008 season to run his family business conglomerate in Laurel, Mississippi). Brian MacInnes was the president, and Bill Weiss was the league's secretary and historian.\nMany former MLB coaches and players coached or managed in the GBL, including Kip Gross, Les Lancaster, Mike Marshall, Ozzie Virgil, Jr., Darrell Evans, Garry Templeton, Cory Snyder, Jeffrey Leonard, Gary Carter, Mike Busch, Steve Yeager, Phil Nevin, Charlie Hough, Mark Parent, Tim Johnson, Terry Kennedy, Paul Abbott, Brett Boone, Alex Arias, Rusty Meacham, and Warren Cromartie.\nThe beginning.\nThe league began with a single-entity model whereby the league owned all the clubs (except Tijuana and Japan which were partnerships). Since then, several of the clubs have been sold to private groups.\nIn its inaugural season, the league was composed of eight teams: the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in California; Mesa Miners, Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions in Arizona and the Japan Samurai Bears. All teams played their home games in city- and university-owned stadiums, with the exception of the Samurai Bears, a traveling team of Japanese players that played all of its games on the road. The Japanese team was a late entry as the Tijuana Toros, who led all of minor league baseball in attendance at over 13,000 fans a game, had jumped from the Mexican League to the GBL in December to be a charter member of the league, only to learn that the government of the Mexican state of Baja California would not permit this.\nThree of the GBL's teams, Long Beach, Chico and Yuma, operated in cities that once hosted Western Baseball League teams. The WBL operated from 1995 to 2002.\nOn May 9, 2005, Major League Baseball's all-time stolen base leader, Rickey Henderson, signed a contract to play the 2005 season with the Surf Dawgs.\nThe 2005 season ended with a four-team championship tournament on Labor Day Weekend. The tournament ended with San Diego winning two games on the final day, knocking off Mesa in the second game to win the title.\nJosé Canseco, another retired star, signed with the Surf Dawgs in 2006 as part of his attempt to return to baseball and promote his book, \"\", along with its upcoming movie adaptation. Canseco was traded to the Armada after only one game. He said that the move was to be closer to his daughter.\nSeason 2: League Contracts.\nBefore the 2006 season, Surprise was discontinued, while Mesa moved to Reno, another former Western League city, and became the Reno Silver Sox, the first GBL club in Nevada. The league moved to a six-team format and did not have the traveling Samurai Bears return.\nLeague expands to Utah and Canada.\nPrior to the 2007 season, the San Diego Surf Dawgs operation was discontinued as San Diego State breached the lease agreement with the league and subsequently paid a settlement. The GBL remained at six teams by adding the St. George RoadRunners. The Utah city also hosted a Western League club from 1999 to 2001, the Zion Pioneerzz, becoming the fifth former WBL city to join the league.\nIn 2008, two former Northern League clubs, the Calgary Vipers and Edmonton Cracker-Cats, joined the GBL, becoming the loop's first two Canadian teams.\nThe league expanded to nine teams in 2009 with the addition of the Victoria Seals, while the Reno Silver Sox moved to Tucson to become the Toros. The Cracker-Cats were sold to Edmonton Oilers owner Daryl Katz and renamed the Edmonton Capitals for the 2009 season.\nTijuana joins league in 2009 and will play in 2010.\nOn December 15, 2008, the league signed a letter of intent to place another expansion franchise in Tijuana, Mexico. After the addition of the expansion Tijuana Potros on January 13, the Armada were moved to the North Division. The Potros themselves would postpone the season due to the swine flu outbreak in Mexico. This made all their scheduled games days off for the other nine teams and left their GBL future in serious doubt.\nAs planned, the Tijuana team did return for the 2010 season but came back with a new name and additional owners. The Tijuana Cimarrones were announced as a member of the GBL when the schedule was released on January 15, 2010.\nYuma becomes a Colombian affiliation in 2009.\nOn May 20, 2009, the Yuma Sun reported that the team had signed an affiliation agreement with the Colombian Professional Baseball League (CPBL). Under the terms of the affiliation, the CPBL will handle all on-field personnel and player issues while the team will retain control of promotions, concessions, and other front-office business. The Scorpions will act as a showcase team for players from all four CPBL teams.\nYuma Scorpion Reynaldo Rodriguez, of Cartagena, Colombia, was named GBL 2009 Rookie of the Year, the top prospect in all the independent leagues by Baseball America, and had his contract purchased by the Boston Red Sox.\nMaui announced for 2010, Long Beach suspended.\nOn September 30, 2009, the GBL announced that the Hawaiian sports and entertainment company XnE Inc. had purchased the territory rights to place teams in Hawaii and that their inaugural team would play at the War Memorial Complex in Maui in 2010. The team announced their name as \"Na Koa Ikaika Maui\", which means the Strong Warriors of Maui.\nThe Long Beach Armada announced that they were suspending operations due to an ongoing stadium lease dispute with the city of Long Beach.\nKaval leaves GBL for MLS, League to expand east.\nDave Kaval, co-founder and C.E.O. of the GBL since its inception in 2005, resigned to take the job as team president of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer.\nThe United League and the Northern League agreed to join the GBL for the 2011 season in the formation of the new North American League. The Rockford RiverHawks, Schaumburg Flyers, Joliet Jackhammers, and Lake County Fielders planned on leaving the Northern League and join the GBL for 2011 with the new format. United League teams joining the NAL include the Edinburg Roadrunners, Harlingen Whitewings and San Angelo Colts.\nDrug testing.\nThe league was the only independent baseball association to have drug testing. The league CEO Dave Kaval explained:\n\"I feel that there is no place for illegal drugs in our business. We run a family-friendly operation off the field, and illegal drug usage by our players would undermine the trust we have established with our fans. That is exactly what has happened at the MLB level. As a steward of the great game of baseball, I am proud to say that we have the most stringent drug policy in all of professional baseball.\"\nSeason-by-season results.\n2005 Season.\nx-Division Champion y-Wild Card (Division champions and top two wild card teams go to Championship.)\nGold Glove winners:\nPitcher: Adam Pettyjohn, Long Beach\nCatcher: Cody Clark, San Diego\nFirst base: Yuji Nerei, Samurai Bears\nSecond base: Kenichi Miura, Samurai Bears\nThird base: Sean Walsh, Fullerton\nShortstop: Jeremy Hernandez, Long Beach\nOutfielders Marcus Knight, Mesa; Billy Brown, Surprise; Travis McAndrews, Long Beach\n2006 season.\nz-First-half champion and best overall record, x-second-half champion (Champions of each half face in 5-game series for championship.

The 2008 game was hosted by the ULB's San Angelo Colts, while the 2009 game was to be hosted by the Orange County Flyers. However, the United League went bankrupt in the off-season after 2008, causing the 2009 All-Star Game to be cancelled.\n2009 Golden League All-Star Game.\nIn replacement of the 2009 All-Star Game against the United League, the GBL held its own All-Star Game. The game was between the two divisions, taking place in St. George, Utah - home of the RoadRunners, on Tuesday, July 14.

These leagues folded with the NAL in 2013.\nArizona Winter League.\nOn November 15, 2006, the Golden Baseball League announced the Arizona Winter League, which would be a short-season instructional league for its summer league. The league began play on January 19, 2007. The Arizona Winter League has just completed its third season. In the first three years, over 130 Arizona Winter League players have been signed to professional contracts.

        "title": "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved",
        "text": "\"The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved\" is a seminal sports article written by journalist Hunter S. Thompson on the 1970 Kentucky Derby, which first appeared in \"Scanlan's Monthly\" in June of that year. The article marked the birth of what would become known as \"gonzo journalism\".\nHistory.\nThe idea for the story began at a dinner party at the Aspen, Colorado, home of novelist James Salter. Hunter S. Thompson queried \"Scanlan's Monthly\" editor Warren Hinckle, who approved the project and paired Thompson with illustrator Ralph Steadman for the first time.\nThe genesis of the article has been described by Thompson as akin to \"falling down an elevator shaft and landing in a pool of mermaids.\" Faced with a deadline and without any coherent story for his editors, Thompson began tearing pages from his notebook, numbering them, and sending them to the magazine. Accompanied by Ralph Steadman's sketches (the first of many collaborations between Thompson and Steadman), the resulting story, and the manic, first-person subjectivity that characterized it, were the beginnings of gonzo journalism.\nThe article is less about the actual Kentucky Derby – indeed, Thompson and Steadman could not actually see the race from their standpoint – than the revelry surrounding the event. Thompson's depiction includes the events in Louisville, his hometown, in the days before and after the Derby, and Steadman captured the debauched atmosphere in his surreal drawings. Thompson provided up-close views of activities in the Derby infield and the grandstand at Churchill Downs, and a running commentary on the drunkenness and lewdness of the crowd, which he states in the article as the only thing he was focusing on. The narrative ends with Thompson and Steadman's realization that, by participating in the drunken pageantry of the event, they had become exactly what they had originally planned to caricature.\nShortly after Thompson's suicide in 2005, Steadman recalled his first impression of Thompson at the Kentucky Derby to the British newspaper \"The Independent\":\nI had turned around and two fierce eyes, firmly socketed inside a bullet-shaped head, were staring at a strange growth I was nurturing on the end of my chin. \"Holy shit!\" [Thompson] exclaimed. \"They said I was looking for a matted-haired geek with string warts and I guess I've found him.\" ...This man had an impressive head chiseled from one piece of bone, and the top part was covered down to his eyes by a floppy-brimmed sun hat. His top half was draped in a loose-fitting hunting jacket of multi-colored patchwork. He wore seersucker blue pants, and the whole torso was pivoted on a pair of huge white plimsolls with a fine red trim around the bulkheads. Damn near 6-foot-6 of solid bone and meat holding a beaten-up leather bag across his knee and a loaded cigarette holder between the arthritic fingers of his other hand.\nRelease.\nThe article was first released in the June 1970 edition of \"Scanlan's Monthly\". It was later reprinted in Tom Wolfe's 1973 anthology \"The New Journalism\" and in Thompson's 1979 anthology \"The Great Shark Hunt\".\nReception.\nThe article was not widely read at the time, but Thompson did garner attention from other journalists for its unusual style. In 1970, Bill Cardoso, editor of \"The Boston Globe\" Sunday Magazine, wrote to Thompson, whom he had met on a bus full of journalists covering the 1968 New Hampshire presidential primaries. Cardoso praised the piece as a breakthrough: \"This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling.\" Considered the first use of the word \"gonzo\" to describe Thompson's work, Thompson took to the word right away, and according to Steadman said, \"Okay, that's what I do. Gonzo.\""

The Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast, that features a combination of the website and magazine team and has included guests such as David Gower, Graham Thorpe, and Steve Harmison, was launched in October 2018.\nThe driving force behind the creation of WCM was its first editor, David Frith, formerly an editor of its rival, \"The Cricketer\". At first, it operated under the \"Wisden\" name using licence from John Wisden &amp; Co. \"Wisden\" later bought a controlling interest.\nAfter 202 editions, Frith gave way to Tim de Lisle, before Stephen Fay took over from de Lisle after he moved to Wisden's online venture. The last issue of the original WCM, in September 2003, coincided with Fay's 65th birthday and his retirement."

        "text": "James Ross Walker (born July 1, 1971) is an American former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He previously pitched for the Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers, and Baltimore Orioles.\nBiography.\nWalker graduated from Warren County Senior High in McMinnville, Tennessee in 1989. He attended Austin Peay State University between 1990 and 1992 and ranks fifth all-time in school history with 17 wins and first with three career shutouts. Walker was drafted in the 10th round (265th overall) of the 1992 MLB draft by the Houston Astros.\nWalker crossed the picket lines and participated in spring training during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike as a replacement player. As a result, he was barred membership to the Major League Baseball Players Association. This prevented Walker from being listed among Tigers players on their 2006 ALCS championship merchandise. Walker has been clear and candid about his role as a replacement player with his major league teammates.\nIn , Walker nearly broke the major league record for most appearances in a season without a decision (no wins or losses). The record was held by Scott Aldred (a former Tiger, coincidentally), who made 48 appearances for the 1998 Tampa Bay Devil Rays while accomplishing this feat. By September 29 (with three games left in the season), he had pitched in 54 games without being credited with a win or a loss. However, he would surrender four runs on three home runs against his former team (the Kansas City Royals) in the top of the 11th inning and was charged with a loss. However, Aldred's record would only hold for one more season, as Trever Miller of the Houston Astros set the new mark by making 76 appearances without a decision in 2007.\nHonors and awards.\nWalker was named Ohio Valley Conference Pitcher of the Year in 1992. He was inducted into the Austin Peay State University Athletics Hall of Fame on February 8, 2003, and into the Warren County, Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame on December 19, 2006.\nPersonal life.\nWalker is married (wife Natalie) and has three sons (Ross, born 1995, James Leyland, born 2007, and Isaac, born 2009). Although the name is the same, he is not named after Walker's former manager in Detroit. He also has two daughters (Harlee, born 1999; Hannah, born 2004). The family resides on their Kansas ranch in Smith Center. They have a second home in Overland Park, Kansas."

        "text": "Prince's Golf Club, Sandwich is a links golf course located in Sandwich in Kent in South East England. Prince's is immediately adjacent to the more famous Royal St George's golf club, and both clubs lie on the same stretch of coastline as nearby Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club. It is notable for hosting the 1932 Open Championship.\nHistory.\nPrince's was financed by Sir Harry Mallaby-Deeley, built and designed by Charles Hutchings, the 1902 Amateur Champion on land donated by the Earl of Guilford. It was completed late in 1906 as an 18-hole course, and was the first course designed to counter the significantly longer Haskell ball. Club captain A.J. Balfour, a former British Prime Minister, drove the first ball in the Founder's Vase in June 1907.\nThe present-day 27-hole layout is the result of a 1950 re-design following war-time damage to the original course. World War II was very hard on Prince's, but Australian entrepreneur Sir Aynsley Bridgland intervened, engaging Sir Guy Campbell and John Morrison to re-design and restore the course. The new layout incorporated 14 of the original greens (but with most played from different directions to the original course), and eliminated any blind tee or approach shots. The re-design always envisaged a centrally located clubhouse, and this was finally opened in 1985 by Peter Alliss, allowing the 27 holes to be played in three loops of nine holes, known as “Shore”, “Dunes” and “Himalayas”, each starting and finishing beside the new clubhouse.\nThe original clubhouse still stands at the entrance to the course and adjacent to the 14th tee of Royal St. George's. It no longer serves as the clubhouse but instead has been completely renovated, called the Lodge, it opened in May 2012, with two adjoining buildings, which house 38 bedrooms, a brasserie and lodge.\nPrince's is notable for hosting the 1932 Open Championship, which was won by the American Gene Sarazen. Sarazen debuted his newly invented sand iron at the Championship, and his original club was on display at Prince's for many years, until insurance costs became prohibitively expensive. The greenside bunker beside the 9th green on the Himalayas course, a bunker he played from on his way to victory, was unveiled as The Sarazen Bunker in his honour by Pádraig Harrington in June 2011.\nPrince's is the only club to host The Open just once. The club remains an Open Championship Local Final Qualifying course, and hosted qualifying again in 2011 when The Open returned to Royal St. George's; Prince's professional golfer Francis McGuirk finished tied second to claim one of the three available spaces.\nPrince's has also hosted various other senior and minor professional tournaments, and a number of tournaments for amateurs, including the 1956 Curtis Cup, the 2006 Amateur Championship (co-hosted with Royal St George's), the 2006 Ladies' British Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship, the 2008 Senior Open Amateur Championship (co-hosted with Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club) and the 2013 Amateur Championship (co-hosted with Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club).\nThe late WWII ace, Member of Parliament and 1949 Walker Cup captain Percy Belgrave \"Laddie\" Lucas was born in the old clubhouse at Prince's, his father being the first club secretary. During WWII, Lucas used his knowledge of the course to make an emergency landing after his Spitfire was crippled over northern France. Today, a commemorative plaque by the 4th tee on the Himalayas course marks the spot where he landed. In memory of Lucas, Prince's hosts an annual golf tournament, the Laddie Lucas Spoon, for boys and girls aged 8–13 years.\nPhil Mickelson and Gary Player are both honorary life members of Prince's Golf Club. Ladies European Tour player Helen Wadsworth is a former member and played at Prince's as a junior.\nIn August 2009 Troon Golf announced an agreement to take over course management at Prince's and the club has undertaken a number of renovations to the course.\nScorecards.\nPrinces Golf Club Scorecards\nThe Open Championship.\nPrince's Golf Club hosted The Open Championship in 1932."
