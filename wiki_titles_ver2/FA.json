        "text": "Michael J. Reilly Jr. (born July 13, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was originally selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the fourth round (98th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft and previously played in the NHL for the Minnesota Wild, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Chicago, Reilly grew up in Chanhassen, Minnesota. After attending and playing for the Academy of Holy Angels and Shattuck-St Mary's, Reilly was selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Opting not to sign with the Blue Jackets, he went on to play for the University of Minnesota. Reilly was named Big Ten Conference's Defensive Player of the Year and First Team All-American following both his sophomore and junior seasons.\nReilly became an unrestricted free agent on June 15, 2015, after he was unable to come to terms on a contract with Columbus. On July 1, he signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the Minnesota Wild worth $1.85 million, and on January 9, 2016, Reilly made his NHL debut in a 2–1 victory over the Dallas Stars. He scored his first NHL goal on February 13, in a 4–2 loss to the Boston Bruins.\nOn February 26, 2018, Minnesota traded Reilly to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for a fifth-round pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a two-year extension with Montreal worth $3 million following the 2018–19 season. On January 2, 2020, Reilly was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Andrew Sturtz and a fifth-round pick in 2021.\nAfter parts of two seasons in Ottawa, Reilly was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft on April 11, 2021. On July 27, Reilly signed a three-year, $9 million contract extension with the Bruins.\nDue to the Bruins battling salary cap issues, while in just his second season with the club in 2022–23, Reilly was placed on waivers by the Bruins on November 9, 2022. In clearing the following day, Reilly's cap hit was buried and he was re-assigned and played the remainder of the season with the Bruins' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Providence Bruins. On February 24, 2023, Reilly scored his first professional hat-trick in a 6–5 win for Providence, adding two assists as well, resulting in a five-point night.\nHaving completed the season, on June 30, 2023, Reilly was placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a buyout from the remaining year of his contract with the Bruins. Released to be a free agent, Reilly was immediately signed on the opening day of free agency to a one-year, $1 million contract with the Florida Panthers on July 1.\nEntering the 2023–24 season, Reilly was a healthy scratch for the Panthers through the first month of the season before making his debut in a 5–4 overtime victory over the Blue Jackets on November 6, 2023. Reilly was scoreless in two games with the Panthers before he was placed on waivers and later claimed by the New York Islanders on November 25. He made his Islanders debut in a 5–4 defeat by the New Jersey Devils on November 28. His first goal with the Islanders was in a 5–4 overtime loss to the San Jose Sharks on December 5.\nPersonal life.\nReilly's father, Michael Sr., was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the eighth round of the 1977 NHL Amateur Draft, but ultimately never played in the NHL."

We used to have the odd first-class player, but generally it was a team of young players trying to make their mark in first-class cricket in India.\" \nThe team played their first match in 1964-65, under the captaincy of the Test captain at the time, the Nawab of Pataudi. He also captained the team in 1965-66 and 1966-67, when the team played one match each time. Pataudi scored three centuries: one in each match. In 1964-65 Ramnath Parkar made his first-class debut, in 1965-66 Eknath Solkar, and in 1966-67 Mohinder Amarnath, at 16, made his first-class debut alongside Gavaskar. All three matches were drawn, with Vazir Sultan Tobacco Colts XI conceding the first-innings lead.\nIn 1967-68, now captained by Ambar Roy, Vazir Sultan Tobacco Colts XI beat Hyderabad Cricket Association XI and Hyderabad Blues to proceed to the semi-final against State Bank of India, which ended with the scores level and State Bank of India 57 for 7. In 1968-69 they again reached the semi-final, this time losing a match outright for the first time, to State Bank of India; Dilip Doshi was among those making their first-class debuts.\nSrinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan captained a side of nine first-class debutants in 1969-70, and Bharath Reddy, aged 18 and making his own first-class debut, captained a side of ten first-class debutants in 1973-74. However, apart from Reddy himself, none of these debutants went on to play Test cricket.\nIn all, Vazir Sultan Tobacco Colts XI played 10 first-class matches, winning two, losing two, and drawing six.\nVazir Sultan Tobacco XI.\nIn contrast to the emphasis on youth of the Colts XI, when the Vazir Sultan Tobacco XI played their first matches in 1970-71 their team included seven Test players, of whom Salim Durani, Vijay Manjrekar and Chandu Borde were in their late thirties. The selection policy changed slightly in 1971-72, when three players made their first-class debuts under the captaincy of Venkataraghavan.\nThey won their first match, against Mafatlal Sports Club, and drew their other four matches between 1970-71 and 1972-73.\nOther teams.\nVazir Sultan Tobacco has sometimes sponsored teams in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament since the tournament lost its first-class status after the 1973-74 season, as well as in other non-first-class competitions."

        "text": "The Zimbabwe men's national field hockey team is the team that represents Zimbabwe in the sport of field hockey. Field hockey has the second biggest player base in the country after football. Currently, Zimbabwe has four pitches, two in Bulawayo – one water base and one sand filled – and another sand filled at the Arundel School and water base at St John's College in the capital city of Harare. Bulawayo has approximately 1,000 hockey players and Harare 8,000. The 5,000-capacity Khumalo Hockey Stadium in Bulawayo is their home stadium. Field hockey club Skies Hockey Club also use the venue for home games. They are currently ranked 61st in International hockey ranking. While the country had a tradition in the sport, they struggled in recent times largely due to their inability to participate in international competitions organized by the African Hockey Federation (AfHF) and the International Hockey Federation (FIH), until the Khumalo Hockey Stadium was refurbished and played host to the 2011 African Olympic Qualifier.\nThe governing body for field hockey is Hockey Association of Zimbabwe. It was formed in 1925.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nBack when the country was Rhodesia, the national hockey team qualified for the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo after beating the United Arab Republic. Team captain Lloyd Koch was Rhodesia's flag bearer, and \nthe team won one game against New Zealand. Koch scored two goals in the tournament.\n1980s – Rise in Africa after Independence.\nZimbabwe got independence in 1980. Soon after independence, various attempts were made to establish sports in the country. Women's team won the inaugural Gold medal in 1980 Olympics. Men's team picked the graph and went on to perform decent in the International games. They won silver and bronze medals in 1987 and 1991 All-Africa Games respectively. The team also bagged bronze medal in Hockey African Cup for Nations in 2000 by defeating Ghana. They managed to hold a strong position in the African continent for almost two decades.\nDecline and re-establishment.\nZimbabwe saw a drought in sports after the year 2000. They couldn't manage to maintain their spot in the African region and fall down to sixth in the continental ranking. To revive the game of hockey in the country, 2011 African Olympic Qualifier were organised in Zimbabwe. But the problem was the stadium was not ready by that time. Zimbabwe asked help from South Africa. On 8 July 2011 The Hockey Association of Zimbabwe announced that the ship with the containers holding the new carpet for the Khumalo Hockey Stadium (KHS) was due to dock in Durban, South Africa. Chairman of the Hockey Olympic Qualifiers local organising committee Gavin Stephens said in a statement that the carpet should be delivered to Bulawayo by 16 July.\n\"This will keep the project on course for commissioning by the end of July. It is understood that the Ministry of Public Works is rushing to meet the deadline, with their work schedule lagging behind.\"\nIn response to a call from the Matabeleland Hockey Board (MHB), approximately 60–70 people arrived at the Khumalo Hockey Stadium on Saturday, 2 July 2011. About 20 of these were labourers from Petra School, Burger &amp; McBean and Precast Concrete Products. The other 50 were made up of hockey players, parents of hockey players, and members of general public.\nThe Minister of Education, Sport, Arts and Culture, David Coltart, arrived to lend his support, while both current and former national and provincial hockey players were also present. Zimbabwe performed poorly in the tournament and lost 4 out of 5 games with a draw against Morocco. \nLater on, Zimbabwe hosted African Hockey Club of Championship in 2014 and won silver medal after losing to Kenya by 7–0.\n2015–2018.\nSince then, Zimbabwe are regularly organizing local competitions and events. They registered their biggest win in 2015 African Olympic Qualifier by defeating Botswana by 19–0. Matthew Williams scored record 6 goals in the game, becoming first Zimbabwean ever to score more than 5 goals in a match. He emerged as highest scorer for Zimbabwe in the tournament by scoring 11 goals. In 2018, Zimbabwe played a 5 match test series against their arch rivals Namibia and lost all the games. Tendayi Maredza, who is currently the skipper of the team is regarded as one of the finest players in the African continent. Maredza was included in the International XI side that toured South Africa in 2016. Pritchard Matambo has emerged as the unsung hero having defended the team for more than a decade.\n2018–19 Men's Hockey Series Open.\nThe 2018–19 Men's Hockey Series Open was the first stage of the 2018–19 edition of the Hockey Series. It was held from June to December 2018. Zimbabwe participated and hosted the Bulawayo pool.

        "text": "Joe Woods (born June 25, 1970) is an American football coach who is the defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). A coaching veteran of 26 years, Woods has previously served as an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers, Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, as well as defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns.\nCollege career.\nWoods lettered four times as a cornerback and safety during his collegiate career at Illinois State University, graduating from the school in 1992 with a degree in criminal justice. He was team captain as a senior in 1991 and went on to earn first-team All-Gateway Conference honors following his final season.\nCoaching career.\nEarly years.\nWoods began his coaching career as a defensive backs coach at Muskingum College in 1992 and moved on to become a graduate assistant coach at Eastern Michigan University in 1993. Woods also served as defensive backs coach at Kent State University (1997) and Grand Valley State University (1994-96) following a stint coaching linebackers during the spring of 1994 at Northwestern State University. He coached the same position with Hofstra University from 1998 to 2000, helping the school make consecutive trips to the 1-AA playoff quarterfinals. Woods then became the defensive backs coach for three seasons (2001-03) at Western Michigan University.\nNFL.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn 2004, Woods was hired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the defensive backs coach. During his first two seasons with Tampa Bay, Woods coached a talented secondary led by cornerbacks Ronde Barber and Brian Kelly. Barber, an NFL 2000s All-Decade performer, earned first-team All-Pro recognition from the Associated Press following each of his two seasons playing for Woods.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nWoods was brought to Minnesota in 2006 along with Defensive Coordinator Mike Tomlin, who worked with him as a secondary coach in Tampa Bay. Woods spent eight seasons coaching defensive backs in Minnesota. The Vikings finished among the NFL's top 10 defenses in four of his first five years with the team, capturing back-to-back NFC North Division titles from 2008 to 2009 and making an NFC Championship Game appearance following the 2009 season.\nOakland Raiders.\nWoods coached the Raiders’ defensive backs in 2014, working with veteran safety Charles Woodson, who led the team with 160 tackles (105 solo) and four interceptions in his 17th NFL season.\nDenver Broncos.\nIn Woods’ first season coaching the Broncos’ secondary in 2015, Denver finished first in the NFL against the pass (199.6 ypg) while the defensive backfield accounted for 11 interceptions, 56 passes defensed, nine forced fumbles and four touchdowns. The Broncos posted three interceptions against just one passing touchdown allowed during Denver's postseason run that ended with a victory in Super Bowl 50. In 2016, the Broncos’ secondary held opponents to the fewest yards per game (185.8), yards per attempt (5.8) and passing touchdowns (13) in the NFL.\nAfter the departure of defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, Woods was chosen to be promoted to defensive coordinator for the 2017 season. Denver finished first in the NFL in pass defense in both 2015 (199.6 ypg) and 2016 (185.8) with Woods coaching the team's defensive backs. All four of Denver's starting defensive backs made at least one Pro Bowl playing for Woods from 2015 to 2016, including cornerbacks Chris Harris Jr. (2015-16) and Aqib Talib (2015-16), who were also named first-team All-Pro selections by the Associated Press in 2016. Safeties T. J. Ward (2015) and Darian Stewart (2016) also earned Pro Bowl recognitions while playing for Woods. \nIn Woods’ first season as defensive coordinator in 2017, the Broncos finished third in the NFL in total defense, giving up just 290.0 yards per game. The Broncos’ fifth-ranked run defense in 2017 was particularly impressive as it improved by more than 40 yards per game after finishing 28th in the NFL in 2016.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nIn January 2019, the San Francisco 49ers hired Joe Woods as defensive back coach and passing game coordinator.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn February 7, 2020, Woods was hired by the Cleveland Browns as their defensive coordinator under head coach Kevin Stefanski. He was fired on January 9, 2023.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn February 6, 2023, the New Orleans Saints hired Woods as their defensive coordinator."

        "text": "Ian Drew Thomas (born April 20, 1987) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nCareer.\nAmateur and independent leagues.\nThomas is a graduate of Kellam High School. He played college baseball at Louisburg College and Virginia Commonwealth University. After going undrafted in the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, he signed with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Northern League. In 2010, he was the Northern League Rookie Pitcher of the Year, after going 5–1 with a 1.64 earned run average (ERA). After three years with Winnipeg, he signed with the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 2012.\nAtlanta Braves.\nIn May 2012, he signed a minor league deal with the Atlanta Braves. He appeared in 26 games, going 5–0 with a 3.15 ERA and 58 strikeouts over 45 innings. In 2013, he pitched for the Mississippi Braves. He started 13 of 39 total games, finishing with a 2.76 ERA and 123 strikeouts over innings. Thomas was a nonroster invitee to 2014 Spring training with the Braves where he pitched 10.1 innings in 11 Spring training games for a 1–0 record, 2.61 ERA, 13 strikeouts, and a 1.16 WHIP. He was not expected to make the parent club, anticipating AAA Gwinnett as his 2014 team. However, due to a rash of injuries to Braves' pitchers and an impressive Spring training run, Thomas was one of the final two players (along with fellow left-handed reliever Ryan Buchter) named to the Atlanta Braves' Opening Day roster. He was filling a relief role with the club.\nOn May 4, 2014, Thomas was optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett to make room for Gavin Floyd, who was activated off the disabled list. He was moved to the starting rotation in Gwinnett where he made one start, not allowing any runs in three innings and striking out five. The Braves tasked the lefty with developing a slider to add to his arsenal, strengthening his value to the Braves when they need him again. On May 10, 2014, he was recalled to Atlanta to replace Jordan Walden, who was placed on the 15-day DL for a pulled hamstring. He was expected to remain with Atlanta until May 20. He was optioned back to Gwinnett on May 31. Thomas was invited to spring training in 2015, and reassigned to Gwinnett on March 9. Thomas was recalled on April 21, a day after Andrew McKirahan was suspended for eighty games.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn May 27, 2015, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (with Alberto Callaspo, Eric Stults and Juan Jaime) in exchange for Juan Uribe and Chris Withrow. The Dodgers assigned him to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. He was recalled by the Dodgers on June 2 to serve as the designated \"26th man\" for a doubleheader that day. He allowed four runs on five hits in three innings of work and was credited with the loss. He returned to the team in September and appeared in nine total games for the Dodgers, with a 4.00 ERA. In 14 games, with six starts, for Oklahoma City, he was 4–1 with a 5.74 ERA. Thomas appeared in eight games for Oklahoma City in 2016, with two starts. He was 2–0 with a 1.42 ERA However, he was shut down with a shoulder injury and spent much of the season on the disabled list. He was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on June 30, 2016, to make room for newly acquired pitcher, Bud Norris and released a few days later, on July 3.\nLater career.\nOn April 25, 2019, after several years out of professional baseball due to injuries, Thomas signed with the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He was released on July 28."

Chile became the third South American nation to join the IIHF after Brazil and Argentina. Chile is currently an IIHF affiliate member, and therefore not recognized for ice hockey, just inline hockey. There are three ice rinks in Chile (Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas).\nChile made its debut in international ice hockey competition at the 2017 Pan American Tournament, which was held in Mexico City, Mexico between 5 and 11 June 2017. The first game on 5 June 2017 was a defeat to Argentina \"A\" 26–0. The second game came against the would-be champions of the tournament, Mexico \"A\", losing 17–0. The third game created a number of milestones for the Chilean team. The first goal in country history, and eventual game-winner was scored by the Chilean captain, Carlos Valdebenito Jr., who scored 3 goals and adding 2 assists totaling 5 points, also making it the current most points in the game record in the 6–0 victory over Brazil \"B\". However, the team's win over a club or \"B\" team was unofficial, and therefore does not count towards Chile's official international record. Chilean goalkeeper, Leonidas Aceitón, recorded his first shutout. Unfortunately, they suffered several injuries in the first three games of the tournament and having traveled with only eight skaters and one goalie, Chile was given permission by the tournament organizers to use players from other countries. Players from Mexico and Brazil joined the squad in the fourth game onwards. The fourth game was a hard-fought 4–3 victory over Argentina \"B\". The fifth game turned in a 6–0 loss to Colombia (Red). The sixth and final game was played on 11 June, a 9–0 defeat to Brazil \"A\". In the end, they finished 7th place with a record of 2–4.\nOn 6 September 2019, Chile played at the Amerigol LATAM Cup, sanctioned by the AmeriGol International Hockey Association, in Coral Springs, Florida, United States. This marks the second tournament appearance (first Amerigol LATAM Cup appearance) for the Chilean squad. Both times skating in Division I. Tournament record stands 0–3.

He set several records for a freshman quarterback at Texas in 1988.\nHigh school.\nMurdock played football at Westwood High School in Round Rock just outside Austin. He led the team to an 8-2 record and was a top 30 recruit for the state of Texas in 1987 after throwing for 1,800 yards and 22 touchdowns.\nLonghorn career.\nAfter redshirting his freshman year in 1987, Murdock shared playing time with senior Shannon Kelley in 1988. He replaced Kelley in wins over New Mexico and North Texas early in the season. In the 6th game of the season, after replacing Kelley, Murdock rallied Texas from a 24-3 third quarter deficit throwing 2 touchdown passes to bring Texas to within striking range, but the Razorbacks held on to preserve a 27-24 win. Nonetheless, Murdock played well enough to earn the starting job for the rest of the season. In his first start against Texas Tech in Lubbock, Murdock threw for 326 yards and two touchdowns in a 33-32 loss. In the final game of the season against Texas A&amp;M, Murdock again rallied the team from behind. Trailing 28-0 in the 2nd quarter, Murdock threw 3 touchdowns and led the team to within 4 points before time expired. Nonetheless, Murdock played well enough to set freshman records at Texas for single-season passing touchdowns, single game passing touchdowns and single-season passing yards and being named to The Sporting News Freshman All American team.\nIn 1989, Murdock came into the season as a starter with a new Offensive Coordinator, Lynn Amadee. Texas started off the season against a difficult schedule. First, in Boulder against national title contender Colorado and then Penn State in Austin. After a 1-2 start, he was replaced by redshirt freshman Peter Gardere.\nIn 1990, he played in 4 games.\nLife After Football.\nMurdock obtained his degree from the University of Texas in the in 1991. He is currently an investor in Houston, TX. Murdock is married to the former Jenny Turner who was an individual and team SWC Champion golfer at The University of Texas and also played on the LPGA tour. Jenny is now the Varsity Golf Coach at Second Baptist School in Houston, TX. Mark and Jenny have three children, Mark, Drew, and Turner."

It occurred on 11 February.\nIn the competition on the Okurayama jumping hill, conditions were \"variable and unfair\" according to a Norwegian account of the 1972 Games published in 2006, and the result is described as \"the greatest surprise of all time on the jumping hill\". In the first run, the 19-year-old Zakopane mechanic Wojciech Fortuna completed a leap of 111 metres, while Manfred Wolf of East Germany was runner-up after the first run having jumped 107 metres. Jiří Raška, Gariy Napalkov and Tauno Käyhkö, all counted among the favourites according to Jorsett's account, were all more than 12 metres behind, Yukio Kasaya, who won on the normal hill, landed on 90 metres, and Ingolf Mork, the 1972 Four Hills Tournament winner, touched down on 88 metres.\nFortuna's second jump was a more modest 87.5 metres; still, the tenths of a point remained on his side. Again according to Jorsett, Steiner (103 metres), Schmidt (101 metres) and Käyhkö (100.5 metres) got lucky with the wind in the second run, but all finished within 0.7 points of Fortuna. This was the smallest margin between first and fourth to date.\nPudgar's eighth place was the best placing by a Yugoslav at the Winter Olympics ski jumping until Matjaž Debelak won bronze at the 1988 Winter Olympics, and the best placing by a Yugoslav athlete at any Winter Olympic event until alpine skier Bojan Križaj finished fourth in giant slalom at the 1980 Winter Olympics."

The Bond University Rugby Club plays in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition.\nHistory.\nThe foundation club for rugby union on the Gold Coast was the Gold Coast Eagles. The club was registered with the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU) after a positive response at the initial foundation meeting in late 1964.\nThe Gold Coast team's first season of rugby was in the 1965 Queensland Subbies competition, playing out of Rudd Park in Burleigh Heads. Coached by Paul Perrin and Bob Sinclair, the team went on to win the competition in 1965 and 1966, and finished second in 1967. In 1968, the QRU directed the Gold Coast to play in the Brisbane first grade competition. The team managed to defeat the eventual premiers GPS on their home ground but did not win any other matches for the season. This bad run of results and the logistics of traveling to Brisbane resulted in the Gold Coast team dropping out of all rugby competition in 1969. The club was reformed and rejoined Subbies in 1970.\nIn 1973, Col Macdonald and Barry Moon proposed the establishment of a second club on the Gold Coast, and the Surfers Paradise Dolphins club was founded in 1974. Coached by ex-Wallaby Alan Ware, the Surfers Paradise club played their first home games on the grounds of The Southport School.\nIn 1978 the Gold Coast and District Rugby Union affiliated with the Queensland Country Rugby Union.\nClubs.\nBond University Rugby Club competes in Queensland Premier Rugby.\nGold Coast clubs that play in the GCDRU senior grade competitions, as of 2014, are:\nAdditional clubs with junior teams that play in the Gold Coast age-group competitions include:\nRepresentative teams.\nThe GCDRU selects representative teams each year which play under the name \"Cyclones\".

She asked that Mass be said in her house until a church was built. The Jesuits also went to South Wimbledon for the Catholics there and said Mass in St Mary's School. In 1884, Edith Arendrup commissioned the construction of Sacred Heart Church in the area. It was finished in 1887 and designed by Frederick Walters.\nBy 1903, the number of Catholics were growing in South Wimbledon and it was decided to build another church in the parish to accommodate to increasing congregation. The same architect of Sacred Heart Church, Frederick Walters, was asked to design the church. Construction started in 1904 and finished in 1905. The Jesuit influence on the church is shown by there being a statue of Saint Ignatius close to a statue of the parish patron, Saint Winefride.\nIn 1961, the Jesuits handed over administration of the church to the Archdiocese of Southwark who continue to serve the parish.\nIn the 1980s the church was reordered with the altar being brought forward. Stained glass was added to some of the windows and a central heating system was installed at this time. The church has a hall on Bridges Road, this continues as parish hall and was renovated in 2004.\nParish.\nThere are three Sunday Masses in the church, one at 6:00pm on Saturday evening, and then at 9:00am and 11:00am on Sunday morning.

        "text": "Christ the King Church is a Roman Catholic Parish church in the Wimbledon Park area of Wimbledon in the London Borough of Merton. It was founded in 1913, and built in 1926 by the Society of Jesus. The architect was Adrian Gilbert Scott.\nHistory.\nIn 1877, The Jesuits came to Wimbledon at the request of Edith Arendup, a member of the Courtauld family, from Roehampton where they had their novitiate, Manresa House. In 1887, she commissioned the building of Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon. From that church the Jesuits ministered to the Catholics of the area. From 1913, Fr Ignatius O'Gorman SJ travelled to the Catholics in the Wimbledon Park area.\nOriginally, the rector of the Sacred Heart Church only allowed one Sunday Mass to be said in the area. In 1926, the rector and the Bishop of Southwark, Peter Amigo allowed for Fr O'Gorman to have the church built. Adrian Gilbert Scott designed the church and it was completed in 1928. The church, a chapel of ease of Sacred Heart Church was going to be dedicated to Saint Austin, but in 1925, Pope Pius XI instituted the Feast of Christ the King, so the church was dedicated to Christ the King. The church hall remained dedicated to St Austin.\nIn 1955, the church ceased to be a chapel of ease and became a parish church. The first parish priest was Fr Jordan SJ. In 1959, administration of the church was handed over by the Jesuits to the Diocese of Southwark who continue to serve the parish.\nParish.\nThe church has five Sunday Masses. One is at 6:00pm on Saturday evening, at 8:30am and 10:30am on Sunday morning and at 5:30pm on Sunday afternoon. There is also a Mass in Polish at 12:45pm every Sunday. There are weekday Masses at 9:30am from Monday to Saturday."

He later played junior rugby league for St George, serving the Jersey Flegg and under-23s as a captain. He also appeared as a reserve player for the Penrith Panthers and the Parramatta Eels, respectively from 1989-1997 and 1998-2001.\nHe began coaching while still in junior rugby league. He took two teams to premierships in Parramatta, the Greystanes Devils to the under-17s C-grade and Merrylands to the top tier. After that, he became a development coach for the Penrith Panthers, which led eventually to his coaching the Castleford Tigers. In the 2005 season, the team achieved the National League One title and, under his direction, was promoted to Super League. Woods was then released by the Tigers because they wanted a better known coach to guide them in their Super League career.\nHe later coached Gateshead Thunder and in his second season took them bottom of the table to champions of Championship 1. That year, he was awarded the National League Two Coach of the Year award. However, immediately thereafter, he was released by Gateshead Thunder. For several years, Woods left full-time rugby as he pursued a constructive dismissal case against the Gateshead Thunder that became complicated when bankruptcy affected the club. During that time, he served as the Great Britain Community Lions Under-18s coach for the Rugby Football League.\nIn April 2010, Woods joined the York City Knights, first as a part-time director of rugby and then, two months later, as coach. His contract was terminated in September 2011.\nIn 2013, Woods took over as coach for the Whitehaven team."

Each continent will qualify one group through five continental qualification tournaments along with China as hosts. China however, declined its spot and it was reallocated to the next best ranked Asian team. Oceania also declined to use its continental quota and the spot was reallocated to the next best team from Europe. Individual athletes can qualify their nations in one of five continental qualification tournaments. Despite being hosts China did not select an athlete to compete in this event.

As a founding sport, athletics has appeared consistently since its introduction at the 1911 Inter-Empire Games; the recognised precursor to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe competition took place between Sunday 27 July and Saturday 2 August at the temporarily modified Hampden Park, Scotland's national football stadium. The programme commenced with the 26.2 mile marathon, which started and finished at Glasgow Green and included numerous para-sport events throughout. Racewalking events were dropped from the programme for 2014 – a move condemned by walking athletes.\nThe meet was dominated, in terms of golds won, by Kenya, Jamaica who won 10 gold medals apiece and Australia with eight gold medals, though gold and other medals were distributed among 21 teams, and England took away the most medals, 27 including 13 silver medals.\nKenya dominated the distance events, and Jamaica the sprint events, but both also won throwing events for the first time. Host nation Scotland won 4 medals, including gold for Libby Clegg in the T(12) 100 m for athletes with a vision impairment.\nNigeria's Blessing Okagbare took two golds and a silver medal in the three sprint events, the most successful individual athlete at the meet. Jamaican sprint Olympic and World champions Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce both decided to forgo the individual sprint events, but appeared on the final evening of the meet to win golds in the relays.\nPreparation.\nIn preparation for hosting the Commonwealth Games Athletics events, the modified Hampden Park held the full-test Sainsbury's Grand Prix Diamond League event, usually held in London, on Saturday 12 July and Sunday 13 July 2014.\nSchedule.\nOver the 10 days of competition there were 44 medal events plus an additional 6 para-sport disciplines.\nDoping.\nDoping controls were undertaken on competing athletes during the games. Amantle Montsho, a Botswana 400 metres runner and defending Commonwealth Games champion, was the first competitor from the athletics programme to fail a drugs test. After finishing fourth in the 400 m final, her \"A\" sample came back positive for methylhexanamine, a banned stimulant, and she was provisionally suspended pending investigation."

        "text": "Adam Wilcox (born November 26, 1992) is an American professional ice hockey goaltender. He is currently an unrestricted free agent who most recently played under contract with the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League (AHL). He was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 6th round (178th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Wilcox is cousins with former Minnesota Wild goaltender, Alex Stalock. Both Wilcox and Stalock played goaltender for the same high school, South St. Paul.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nIn his sophomore year, Wilcox's outstanding play was rewarded when he was selected as the Big Ten Player of the Year and named to the 2013–14 All-Big Ten First Team.\nWilcox tied Kellen Briggs for the most shutouts in school history (13), with six in his final year with the Gophers. He had the two lowest goals against average in team history. Wilcox had a .932 save percentage as a sophomore in 2013–14, which made him a Hobey Baker Award top-10 finalist, and a top-5 finalist for the inaugural Mike Richter Award. The .932 save percentage is the best in team history. Wilcox's 73 career wins are the most among active NCAA goalies and is tied for third all-time at Minnesota with Hobey Baker Award winner Robb Stauber. Wilcox finishes his college career with a 73-26-14 record (.710) while posting 22 or more wins in all three seasons with the Gophers. Wilcox is a three-time all-conference honoree, and he led the school to three-straight conference titles and three-straight NCAA tournament berths, which included a national championship appearance in 2014. In his final season, Wilcox helped the Gophers win the 2015 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament and capture the school's first conference playoff title since 2007.\nProfessional.\nOn April 1, 2015, it was announced that Wilcox would forego his senior year as he signed a two-year entry level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Wilcox will finish out the remainder of the season on an ATO with the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League.\nDuring his second season with the Crunch in 2016–17, Wilcox was dealt by the Lightning at the trade deadline to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Mike McKenna on March 1, 2017. Assigned to the Springfield Thunderbirds, Wilcox flourished to play out the season in posting 7 wins in 13 games.\nOn June 26, 2017, Wilcox was not tendered a qualifying offer as a restricted free agent from the Panthers. On July 1, 2017, Wilcox signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Buffalo Sabres. He was called up by the Sabres on March 30, 2018, following injuries to goaltenders Robin Lehner and Linus Ullmark. Wilcox made his NHL debut during the last game of the Sabres season on April 7, coming in to relieve Chad Johnson. In this game, Wilcox was credited with the loss without being charged with a goal against because he was the goaltender of record when the winning goal, an empty-netter, was scored. He was sent down to the AHL the following day.\nAs an impending restricted free agent, Wilcox opted to remain within the Sabres organization, agreeing to a one-year AHL contract to continue with the Americans on June 26, 2018. In the following 2018–19 campaign, Wilcox posted 9 wins in 21 games for the Americans, before he was signed to a one-year, two-way contract for the remainder of the season with the Buffalo Sabres on February 24, 2019.\nLeaving the Sabres organization after two seasons, Wilcox was signed as a free agent to a one-year AHL contract with the San Antonio Rampage on August 12, 2019. He was invited to participate with the Rampage's NHL affiliate, the St. Louis Blues 2019 training camp, before returning to begin the 2019–20 season with San Antonio."

The Lance Todd Trophy was won by Mark Aston.\nFirst round.\nThe first round consisted of 60 teams, including clubs in National Conference Division 1 and Division 2, and other amateur clubs from around the country. Additionally, Dublin Blues became the first ever Irish team to take part in the cup. Matches were played on 5–6 December 1997, with the replay being played on 13 December 1997.\nSecond round.\nThe 30 winners of the previous round were joined by an additional 14 clubs from the National Conference Premier Division. Matches were played on 20–21 December 1997, with the replay and postponed matches being played on 27–28 December 1997.\nPlay-off.\nAn additional play-off match between Oldham R.L.F.C. and one of the winners of the second round took place before the next round. This was due to Oldham being originally excluded from the cup, as the original club had been liquidated at the end of the previous season, but the Rugby Football League (RFL) later allowed the club to enter the competition following an appeal, with several of the remaining amateur clubs in the competition offering to play Oldham for a place in the next round. The match took place on 18 January 1998.\nThird round.\nThe 22 winners of the previous round were joined by an additional 18 clubs from the First Division and Second Division. Matches were played on 31 January and 1 February 1998.\nFourth round.\nThe 20 winners of the previous round were joined by an additional 12 clubs from the Super League. Matches were played on 14–15 February 1998, with the replay being played on 18 February 1998.\nFifth round.\nMatches were played on 28 February and 1 March 1998.\nQuarter finals.\nMatches were played on 14–15 March 1998.\nSemi finals.\nThe semi finals were played at neutral venues on 28 and 29 March 1998. Sheffield Eagles won 22–18 against Salford Reds, reaching the Challenge Cup final for the first time in their history, but the match was overshadowed when a man invaded the pitch and attacked referee Stuart Cummings immediately after the end of the game. Wigan Warriors won 38–8 in a one-sided game against London Broncos."

        "title": "Mass Transit Super Bowl",
        "text": "The Mass Transit Super Bowl was a public transportation plan and marketing strategy conceived for Super Bowl XLVIII and Super Bowl Week, a series of events leading up to the February 2, 2014, football game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. It was originally projected that over 400,000 people would come to the New York–New Jersey region for the game and related activities, and that over 80,000 would attend the game itself; actual patronage of the metropolitan area during that time was projected to be over 500,000. Metropolitan area transit agencies worked with the National Football League, organizers of the event, and developed special services, schedules, fares, and maps to promote the use of mass transit during the week, which began with the arrival of teams on January 26.\nOn game day, those traveling by train experienced overcrowding and long delays due to miscalculated estimations and an unanticipated surge of passengers, which led to complaints and criticism.\nGeography and transportation network.\nSuper Bowl XLVIII was the first to be played outdoors in a cold weather environment, and the first in which two US states (New York and New Jersey) hosted the event. The combination of sports facilities in New Jersey and hotel facilities in New York was a major factor in the NFL decision to choose the location. Activities related to the Super Bowl were spread across the region on both sides of the Hudson River. More than 20 miles separated Super Bowl Boulevard in the Manhattan borough of New York City and the Florham Park facility, where the Broncos practiced in New Jersey. In between is Jersey City, where the teams stayed, the Prudential Center in Newark, site of Media Day, and the stadium and Seahawks' practice facility in New Jersey Meadowlands in East Rutherford, a relatively remote location several miles from central business districts which hosted events in the week leading up to the game.\nIt was anticipated that nearly 400,000 people would visit the region during Super Bowl Week and that on game day, 10,000 to 12,000 would take the train and 40,000 to 50,000 would travel by bus. While those numbers were not extraordinary in comparison to weekday commuting in the region, many out-of-town visitors were unfamiliar with the local transportation systems.\nTransportation plans for what was billed the first \"mass transit Super Bowl\" were announced in December 2013. Public transportation in the metro area is provided by a variety of public agencies and private companies, namely New Jersey Transit (NJT), the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), Amtrak, and New York Waterway. While there is some coordination and joint operations and fare-sharing within the vast complex transit network, each is independent of the other, and charges its own fares, sometimes leading to complicated transfers and other logistical complications between them. NJT, as lead agency, in conjunction with metropolitan partner agencies and the host committee developed special services, fares, and maps and advertising campaigns to promote the use of public transportation during Super Bowl Week.\nSuper Bowl Week.\nIn the week leading up to the game, there were various events throughout, some of which are NFL-sponsored. Highlights of the week as presented by the Host Committee were:\nMass transit.\nRegional Transit Diagram 2014.\nThe Regional Transit Diagram 2014 was produced specifically for the Super Bowl, and according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, \"shows all inter-connections between the regional transit services, and highlights with a football icon those areas where Super Bowl related events will occur on both sides of the Hudson River. The diagram will appear on all transit provider websites, as well as on Super Bowl websites, guides, publications, mobile apps, and folding pocket maps\". It is based on a New York City Subway map originally designed by Massimo Vignelli in 1972. The map shows all the commuter rail, subway, PATH, and light rail operations in urban northeastern New Jersey and Midtown and Lower Manhattan highlighting Super Bowl Boulevard (Broadway with NFL/Super Bowl exhibits), Prudential Center, MetLife Stadium and Jersey City. , the diagram is still updated online.\nMeadowlands Rail Line.\nThe Meadowlands Rail Line is a shuttle service between Secaucus Junction, a major interchange on the Northeast Corridor and Meadowlands Station adjacent to the stadium. In anticipation of increased ridership for the Super Bowl, platforms at Secaucus were extended to accommodate multi-level 10-car train sets which can handle about 1,400 to 1,800 passengers per trip, moving about 14,000 or 15,000 people an hour. Eleven lines of New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and the Metro North Port Jervis Line converge at the station, which is one stop from New York Penn Station, Hoboken Terminal, Newark Penn Station or Broad Street Station. While Amtrak does not normally stop at Secaucus, several trains were scheduled to stop there on game day. Only ticket-holders and those with a \"Fan Pass\" reservation for a ticket, can board the Meadowlands train once they have passed a security checkpoint.\nFan Express.\nThe \"Fan Express\" was a pre-ticketed bus service with direct non-stop express service to and from nine locations. Buses stopped at the Waldorf Astoria New York, Madison Square Park, Time Warner Center, Sixth Avenue near the Washington Square Park in the West Village, and Battery Park City in Manhattan. In addition, they stopped in the Plaza at Harmon Meadow, the Hanover Marriott, and Newark Liberty Airport Marriott Hotel, in New Jersey. Tickets, which cost $51, were for specific scheduled bus departures.\nSuper Pass.\nNew Jersey Transit offered a \"Super Pass\" that provided unlimited system-wide rides between January 27 and February 3, including the Meadowlands Rail Line. The 8-day pass, in both commemorative and non-commemorative versions, costs $50.\nEnhanced service.\nCollectively, during Super Bowl week, NJT, PATH, and the MTA provided more frequent rail service and faster connections to support expected visitors. New Jersey Transit bus operations was also adapted. The transit agencies, within their individual time frames, each halted ongoing construction.\nThe Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH, mass transit system which connects Manhattan, Jersey City, Hoboken Terminal, and Newark Penn Station, increased service on lines.\nNew Jersey Transit Bus Operations, both within the state and to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, implemented service changes and enhanced schedules. NJT Rail provided enhanced service.\nHudson–Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County increased the number of trams running daily after 2 pm from January 27 to February 2, with all three branches on February 1 and 2.\nOn Metro-North Railroad's \"East of Hudson\" lines, there was enhanced post-AM peak inbound service, lengthened trains, and limited extra outbound late evening service Wednesday to Friday (January 29–31). Seventeen additional New Haven Line and two additional Hudson Line trains was added for Saturday, February 1).\nThe New York City Subway created a commemorative MetroCard. Rush-hour-level service operated on the 42nd Street Shuttle on Saturday, February 1. On game day, there were 36 midday subway trains per hour (or about 6 per service) providing access to New York Penn Station. In January 2014, a dozen New York City Subway trains were wrapped with ads advertising the Jaguar F-Type in preparation for the Super Bowl. The ads were mainly targeted at football fans going to watch the Super Bowl.\nThe Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station increased afternoon/evening inbound service Wednesday–Friday and 30-minute service on major branches during peak travel periods on Saturday, February 1.\nTraffic management.\nLincoln Tunnel XBL.\nThe main route from Manhattan to the sports complex is via the Lincoln Tunnel, New Jersey Route 495 and New Jersey Route 3. The Lincoln Tunnel XBL, or exclusive bus lane, normally runs eastbound during morning rush hours. Four miles of Route 3 were repaved in 2013. On February 2 the PANYNJ, which operates the XBL, created two westbound lanes for the Super Bowl. To help alleviate traffic congestion, additional lanes were dedicated to traffic going into New Jersey before the game, and then were dedicated to traffic going into New York after the game. There were also dedicated approach lanes for those with a priority access NFL placard on their vehicles. At the George Washington Bridge, new variable message signs (VMS) provided real-time travel information and special traffic advisories.\nMASSTR.\nThe teams and majority of attendees to the sports complex arrived by bus, with some arriving with other motor vehicles. The Meadowlands Adaptive Signal System for Traffic Reduction, or MASSTR, is an intelligent transportation system for a network of traffic controlled intersections with vehicle detectors which permits \"real-time\" traffic regulation within a forty square mile region. Commissioned by the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission it was first installed in 2012 and expanded to be in place and operational for the 2014 Super Bowl. The New Jersey Department of Transportation suspended all roadway construction in the 20-mile radius of the stadium. With the possibility that it might snow, the state planned numerous ways to keeps roads clear, including spreading of brine and salt, and having plows on stand-by.\nAbout 2,000 parking passes and 300 charter bus permits weren't used on Super Bowl Sunday. The NFL had estimated that as many as 50 fans would ride to the game per charter bus and an average of three people would travel per car.\nSecurity and access.\nThe Super Bowl is considered a top-level National Special Security Event. New Jersey State Police and the NFL host committee installed a chain-link perimeter fence around the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The area was in \"lock-down\" for a week prior to the game. All vehicles entering and leaving are scanned, a precaution through game day. The area was patrolled on land, by air, and by water since it is surrounded by wetlands. More than 3,000 security guards and 700 police officers were scheduled for duty on game day. The sports complex is located at the intersection of number of highways. Security planners planned to strictly limit and regulate access to the area. Event parking spaces were greatly reduced to 13,000 with a cost of $150 each, tailgate parties restricted, and walking to the venue was strictly prohibited.\nThe team hotels, located along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway in Jersey City, and the Hudson River, were inspected and patrolled on a 24-hour basis.\nMass transit is seen as a high-security risk. According to the Transportation Security Administration passengers boarding trains were limited in what they carry on the train and some were screened. Buses and other vehicles entering the security perimeter were also scanned.\nCosts for security at the Meadowlands were approximately $5 million, which was offset by grants, costing taxpayers approximately $1.35 million.\nOvercrowding and delays.\nAt the Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, mistaken estimates of rail ridership by the NFL led to over-crowding and delays on the Meadowlands Rail Line. New Jersey Transit was in charge of operating the Meadowlands Rail Line shuttle between Secaucus and Meadowlands. Approximately 28,000 people took the shuttle to Meadowlands before the Super Bowl, and were faced with waits of up to 90 minutes, due to security delays. Additionally, riders at Secaucus complained of the lack of air-conditioning. After the game ended, more than 33,000 people took the shuttle at Meadowlands back to Secaucus, far over the Meadowlands station's regular operating capacity. At one point, fans were asked to remain inside the stadium until more trains were dispatched to load passengers from the station. A plethora of news sources provided coverage of the plan's poor execution.\nLegislative/NJT inquiry and law firm report.\nNJT costs.\nNJT spent a total of $12.4 million for Super Bowl-related construction initiatives. It had also spent $7.7 million in 2012 to for a new bus service facility that tripled loading capacity at Secaucus Junction in order to allow for additional service during special events at the Meadowlands Sports Complex for emergency-related contingency operations, such as bus diversions from New Jersey Route 495. This came concurrently with $2.5 million in 2013 to extend lower-level platforms at the station to accommodate ten-car trains.\nNJT made a special allocation of $5.3 million for Super Bowl-related expenses such as enhanced rail/bus service and additional security necessary to support the event, given a Level One security designation on par with a presidential inauguration. In May 2013 NJT approved a $1.2 million contract with AECOM, a transportation planning organisation for Super Bowl-related planning and support, including contingency planning and risk management. The chair of the Lackawanna Coalition, a commuter advocacy group, at a NJT board meeting on May 8, 2013, stated that the NJT riders were not beneficiaries of the study, but rather the NFL and therefore should be paid by them.\nThe scope of work included:\nInquiry and report.\nOn February 18, 2014, James Weinstein announced that he would resign as director of NJT on March 2. An initial inquiry by the New Jersey Assembly scheduled for February 21, 2014 was postponed as representatives of NJT and the host committee of the National Football League, partners in the creation of the transportation plan were unable to attend. James Simpson, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation has commissioned other board members to reschedule the hearing and retain retired U.S. District Court Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh to lead the inquiry, which will include representatives from the New Jersey State Police and NFL as well as NJT.\nThe New Jersey Senate Oversight Committee scheduled a hearing on the topic for March 10, 2014 which newly appointed Executive Director Ronnie Hakim requested be cancelled. and was not attended by representatives of NJT or the NFL. In a hearing focused on spending and planning on May 2, 2014, the Hakim told a state Senate committee that NJT's expenses for getting fans to MetLife Stadium during Super Bowl week were $7.2 million, including overtime, which was offset by $1.6 million in transit fares and advertising on its website, trains and the Secaucus Junction station bought by Pepsi}.\nA long-awaited study released in August 2014, produced by the Boston-based law firm of McElroy, Deutsch, Mulvaney &amp; Carpenter at a cost of $350,00 paid by NJT, cites failure of government agencies and the private consultants to accurately predict how many people would arrive by train, management conflicts within NJT, and crowd control by the private firm S.A.F.E. Management as causes for delays and overcrowding.\nUltimately, 28,301 riders arrived and 35,264 left the stadium via the Meadowlands Rail Line. Conflicting train ridership predictions by the three parties making them: AECOM (originally 32,00 and reduced to 17,000) NJT (originally 12,000 and later 13,500) and SP * Gameday, a subsidiary of Standard Parking hired by the NFL, (8,572) were not resolved prior to the game.\nTrains were scheduled to depart every eight minutes. The closure of Pavilion 6a waiting areaby S.A.F.E. Management caused impediments to pedestrian traffic flow and prevented passengers from boarding trains, causing two of them to be delayed by a total of 56 minutes. Eventually the state police was required to bring order to the situation, but corralling of some passengers while others were allowed to roam freely caused indignation and conflicts, while the placement of waiting lines caused bottlenecks. This led some writers to call the entire plan a failure due to the inefficient use of transportation resources.\nConflicting opinions over the use of buses between James Weinstein, then executive director of New Jersey Transit, and James S. Simpson, then commissioner of the Department of Transportation, also caused delays. While buses were on stand-by at Secaucus Junction Weinstein was reluctant to deploy them. The first busload of passengers didn't leave until 11:32 p.m., about an hour after the game ended after Christopher Porrino, chief counsel to Governor Chris Christie, called Weinstein and Simpson and “strongly urged” Weinstein to send in buses."

        "text": "The 2014 BYU Cougars baseball team represented Brigham Young University in the 2014 NCAA Division I baseball season. Mike Littlewood acted in his 2nd season as head coach of the Cougars. The Cougars came off a season where they exceeded expectations. After being picked to finish sixth, the Cougars finished in a 3-way tie for second and eliminated regular season champion Gonzaga in the WCC tournament. The Cougars would finish 32–21.\nFor 2014 the Cougars were picked to finish sixth in the WCC 2014 Pre-season rankings. The Cougars played most of their home games at Larry H. Miller Field. However Bruce Hurst Field hosted one BYU home one series in late February, early March, and Brent Brown Ballpark hosted one BYU game. This was the second consecutive year the Cougars used Bruce Hurst Field for one series due weather concerns. The Cougars ended the season 22–31, 12–15 in conference play, and finished 7th in the WCC Standings.\nSchedule.\n! style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#002654;\"| Regular season\nTV &amp; Radio Information.\nAll home and conference games as well as select non-conference road games (at Utah and at UC Santa Barbara) were broadcast on KOVO with Brent Norton (play-by-play) calling the games for his 25th consecutive season. A rotating selection of analysts will be used. Most of the games were simulcast on BYU Radio.\nBYUtv broadcast 9 home games: Mar. 13 &amp; 15 vs. San Diego, Apr. 3 vs. Pacific, Apr. 17 vs. Loyola Marymount, May 1–3 vs. Gonzaga, and May 8 &amp; 10 vs. Santa Clara. Sister station KBYU aired the May 6 home game vs. Utah. BYUtv/KBYU used Spencer Linton and Dave McCann as their play-by-play men. Gary Sheide returned as the analyst. An additional six games aired on the WCC's online station- TheW.tv: Mar. 4 vs. Utah, Mar. 14 vs. San Diego, Apr. 1 vs. Utah Valley, Apr. 18 vs. Loyola Marymount, May 9 vs. Santa Clara, and May 16 at Portland. TheW.tv games were the conference's first non-basketball broadcasts outside the state of California and the first game featuring a non-conference opponent in baseball. Both games at Utah, Mar. 25 &amp; May 13, aired on Pac-12 Network (the Mar. 25 game being a Pac-12 Mountain exclusive), the game at Utah Valley, Apr. 29, aired on UVU's YouTube channel, the 3-game series at Pepperdine will air on TV-32 Malibu and be simulcast online by WavesCast, and the game at Fresno State aired on the Mountain West Network powered by Campus Insiders. Had the Cougars returned to the WCC baseball tournament, the games would have aired on TheW.tv.\n2014 MLB Draft.\nTwo BYU Cougar players were selected in the 2014 MLB Draft. Both have the option of coming back to BYU should they not sign a contract. Sophomore Pitcher Kolton Mahoney, who just completed his second full year at BYU after serving a church mission to Santa Rosa, California from 2012 to 2013, was selected in the 23rd Round, 686th overall pick, by the Milwaukee Brewers. Shortstop Tanner Chauncey, who was serving a church mission in the Brazil João Pessoa Mission from 2013 to 2014 and would be back for the 2015 season as a sophomore, was selected in the 35th Round, 1,059th overall pick, by the Los Angeles Dodgers."

        "text": "The 2014 ACC men's and women's lacrosse conferences will include six teams, up from four in 2013. Notre Dame and Syracuse joined the ACC in July 2013. This will be the only year that the ACC men's lacrosse conference will include these six teams as Maryland will leave the ACC for the Big Ten at the end of the 2014 season. The finalists from the 2013 NCAA championship game are in the ACC conference in 2014, Duke and Syracuse. Additionally, all six teams are included in the Top 10 of the Lacrosse Magazine preseason ranking. The 2014 ACC men's lacrosse conference includes teams that have won 23 national championships and have 45 appearances in the title game in the 42-year history of the NCAA Championship.\nOn May 4, 2014 the NCAA will announce the 18 teams that will play in the Division I men's lacrosse tournament. As part of this selection, the bottom four teams will play two play-in games. The ACC is one of 10 conferences that have automatic qualifiers, meaning the winner of the ACC tournament will appear in the tournament, leaving five ACC teams competing for eight at-large bids. Four of the six teams in the ACC will compete in the conference tournament on April 25, 2014. PPL Park in Philadelphia, Pa., will host the ACC tournament in both 2014 and 2015.\nNext games.\nNon conference:&lt;br&gt;\nDuke (8-2, #3, 2-1 ACC) vs. Harvard (5-3, #18), Sunday, 3/29/14, 12pm&lt;br&gt;\nNorth Carolina (7-2, #5, 1-2 ACC) vs. Johns Hopkins (5-2, #9), Saturday, 3/29/14, 2pm&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nConference:&lt;br&gt;\nMaryland (7-1, #4, 2-1 ACC) vs. Virginia (7-2, #8, 1-1 ACC), Sunday, 3/30/14, 12pm&lt;br&gt;\nNotre Dame (4-2, #7, 2-0 ACC) vs. Syracuse (4-3, #10, 0-3 ACC), 3/29/14, 12pm\nDuke.\nIn the 2013 season, Duke defeated Syracuse 16-10 to win the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse championship. 15 of the 25 players in the 2013 championships game will play again for Duke in 2014. Attackman Jordan Wolf and face-off man Brendan Fowler were named pre-season first team All-Americans. Joining them on the list on the second team is Henry Lobb, senior defenseman. Honorable mentions are Josh Dionne (attack), Myles Jones (midfield), Will Haus (midfield), Luke Duprey (long-stick midfield) and Chris Hipps (defense). Face-off specialist Brendan Fowler was a first team All-American in 2013. In the four games in the NCAA tournament that year, he won 70% of his face-offs and gathered 10 ground balls per game. For the entire season he won 64% of his face-offs.\nDuke's coaching staff places a priority on ground ball statistics in their post-game reviews. In comparison, Johns Hopkins has found that the four most important post-game statistical considerations are shooting percentage, your opponent's shooting percentage, your save percentage and your opponent's save percentage.\nMaryland.\nIn 2013, Maryland lost to Cornell in the first round of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament.\nNorth Carolina.\nNorth Carolina is the only men's lacrosse team in the ACC that has not been to either the final four or the championship game in the last three years. In fact, UNC has not been to the final four of the NCAA championship tournament since 1993. Last year UNC lost to Denver in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Before that, UNC won the ACC tournament for the first time since in 17 years.\nThe 2014 North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse team will represent the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the 2014 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's lacrosse season. The head coach, UNC alumnus Joe Breschi, will coach UNC for his 6th year. Breschi was previously a first-team All-American defenseman in 1990 and a USA national team member in 1990 and 1994.\nUNC will return seven out of ten players from its 2013 starting lineup. Four midfielders on the 2014 team were on the roster of the U19 USA team in 2012: Brent Armstrong (sophomore), Stephen Kelly (freshman), Steven Pontrello (sophomore) and Michael Tagliaferri (sophomore). UNC and UVA had the most players on the 2012 U19 team, both with four. Returning faceoff man R.G. Keenan was a first-team All-American in 2012. ACC coaches named attackman Joey Sankey to the 2013 All-ACC team. Senior defensive midfielder Mark McNeill also plays wide receiver on the UNC football team.\nSenior midfielder Frankie Kelly and sophomore attackman Patrick Kelly are cousins. Their uncle, Bryan Kelly (UNC 1991), coached them in high school at Calvert Hall in Baltimore, Maryland. Frankie Kelly is freshman Stephen Kelly's older brother. \nFrankie (UNC 2014) and Stephen Kelly (UNC 2017) are brothers and sons of Frank Kelly, III, who played lacrosse at Cornell. Frank Kelly, III has two brothers that played lacrosse at UNC and both won championships at UNC: David Kelly (UNC 1989) and Bryan Kelly (UNC 1991). Both played on the UNC lacrosse team with current head coach Joe Breschi. Patrick Kelly (UNC 2015) is a cousin of Frankie and Stephen Kelly. His father David Kelly (UNC 1989) won a lacrosse championship in 1986. His uncle on his mother's side (Ken Miller) played football at UNC.\nIn other family relations, Junior attackman Jimmy Bitter's older brother Billy Bitter was a first-team All-American for UNC in 2009 and 2010. Sophomore midfielder Jake Matthai's dad played on the UNC lacrosse team from 1975-79. Sophomore goalkeeper Kieran Burke's two older brothers played lacrosse at UNC, Brian (2005–08), a defenseman, and Sean (2007–10), a midfielder.\nUNC had the most recruits in the Inside Lacrosse top 50 rankings for the last two years. UNC had seven players on the Inside Lacrosse top 50 list in 2012 versus nine in 2011. In total, UNC had 16 players in the top 50 lists in the last two years. The next highest count was Duke University with 10.\nStephen Kelly signed a National Letter of Intent with Carolina in November 2012 and will enroll in UNC after he graduates high school in August 2013. Kelly was the only rising senior in high school that made the U19 U.S. Team in 2012 - the rest of the team had already graduated high school.\nNotre Dame.\nIn 2013, Notre Dame lost to Duke in the second round of the Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament.\nSyracuse.\nIn 2013, Syracuse lost to Duke in the finals of the Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament.\nVirginia.\nIn 2013, Virginia did not make the Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament for the first time since 2004. UVA led Division I lacrosse teams in ground balls per game in 2013 with 39.93/game. That average is down in the first three games of 2014 at 36/game."

        "text": "Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and a top order batsman. he has made 80 centuries in international cricket — 29 in Test cricket, 50 in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and 1 century in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nKohli made his ODI debut gainst Sri Lanka in August 2008, and scored his first century the following year when he made 107 against the same team at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. His 86-ball 133 not out against Sri Lanka in February 2012 led India to the second highest run-chase by any team in Australia. Former Australian cricketer Dean Jones described the innings as \"One of the greatest ODI knocks of all time!\". Kohli's highest score of 183 came against Pakistan during the 2012 Asia Cup; India successfully chased a target of 330 set by Pakistan and Kohli was adjudged man of the match. Following that, he made his first century as a captain while playing against the West Indies in the 2013 Triangular Series. In the bilateral series against Australia in October 2013, Kohli made two centuries in successful run-chases. The first of the two, 100 not out, was scored off 52 balls and remains the fastest ODI century by an Indian. The next century, which was scored off 61 balls, remains the third-fastest by an Indian . , Kohli has the most ODI centuries of any player after scoring his 50th ODI century in the 2023 Cricket World Cup knockout stage against New Zealand with a score of 117, and ranks second overall on the list of players who have scored the most centuries in international cricket.\nKohli made his Test debut against the West Indies in 2011 and scored his first century in the format during the Australian tour in January 2012. In the first Test of the 2014–15 Border–Gavaskar Trophy, he became the fourth Indian player to score centuries in both innings of a Test match after making 115 and 141. He was appointed as the captain of the Test team during the series and became the first player to score centuries in each of his first three Test innings as captain. In 2016, Kohli became the fifth player to score three or more double centuries in a calendar year. The following year, he repeated the feat and also became the first batsman to score four double centuries in consecutive Test series. His seven double centuries is the joint fourth-most by a player. In 2017, he became the first captain to score ten centuries in a calendar year. Following year, he scored eleven centuries, second-most in a calendar year to Sachin Tendulkar. In 2019, Kohli scored seven centuries which included five ODI-centuries. Moreover, he scored his highest score in Test-cricket against South Africa. In late 2022, Kohli scored a hundred against Bangladesh in the third ODI to overtake Ricky Pointing's record of 71 centuries scored in international cricket.\nKohli had a three-year century drought until September 2022, when he scored his maiden T20I hundred against Afghanistan. The century was scored after 1,021 days from his previous hundred The innings of 122* was once highest by an Indian in T20I's, later broken by Shubman Gill (126*). In March 2023, Kohli ended his 1,204 day-long Test century drought when he scored his 28th Test century against Australia in the first innings of the fourth test scoring 186 runs."

        "title": "Goaltender (box lacrosse)",
        "text": "The goaltender or goalie is a playing position in indoor or box lacrosse. More heavily armoured than a field lacrosse goaltender, since the invent of indoor lacrosse in 1931, the box lacrosse goalie has evolved into a much different position than its field lacrosse cousin.\nEquipment.\nIn Box Lacrosse, a goaltender is typically more heavily armoured than a field lacrosse goaltender. Box lacrosse goaltenders are known for their massive upper body gear, large shin guards known as \"irons\", and ice hockey-style helmets.\nSticks and Gloves.\nThere are three types of lacrosse sticks in use right now by the modern box lacrosse goaltender. Traditional wooden sticks that are made from the bending of long strips of wood and pockets woven with leather and string. This variation goes back to the roots of the game and is still popular with goaltenders at the amateur levels (senior, junior, and minor) but is cost-inhibitive with new sticks ranging in price from $250–400 CAD. Another long-used goal stick type is the NCAA-head stick. Much smaller and covers less space between the legs, the NCAA-head is much easier for ball control. The newest make of goal stick is the \"carbon triangle\". Similar materials to the NCAA-style stick, the carbon triangle is sized to mimic the coverage of a wooden stick but the lightness of the NCAA-style. This style is becoming very popular in the minor and junior levels, but is banned in the National Lacrosse League. NLL goaltenders generally use NCAA-head sticks.\nAlthough many goalies traditionally wear hockey gloves to protect their hands from high-velocity shots, many goalies have switched to a specialized gloves made specifically for box lacrosse. On the goalies free hand, there is potential for damage to the back of the hand, knuckles, and wrist from a hard shot. Lacrosse goalie gloves have an extra layer of padding on the outside of the glove to deflect damaging shots. This extra padding is on both gloves and serves to also protect the inner wrist of the stick-hand, which is often exposed in the crouch position when wearing hockey gloves as a lacrosse goalie. At the same time, lacrosse goalie gloves are required to give the goalie wrist mobility for when he must handle the ball.\nHelmets.\nBox goalies wear two different types of helmets. One type is the standard field lacrosse helmet, the other is the ice hockey mask. Field masks have strongly reinforced face masks, thick like the bars on a football helmet and also offer a wider range of vision than a hockey mask. Field helmets do little to protect the throat region. Hockey mask padding can be formed to the users head for comfort. Are very easy to remove quickly and are molded especially for shock absorption. Also, despite cutting down the range of vision of the user, actively protects the throat area from straight on shots. In recent years, baseball catcher-style masks have been offered as a medium between the two helmet types.\nAt the minor level, most goalies have to wear throat guards or \"cow catchers\" that attach to the helmet to provide additional coverage for the throat and neck area.\nLeg guards.\nLacrosse leg guards or \"irons\" have taken a massive evolution since the early days of the sport. Early goaltenders wore cricket pads made from thin but rigid padding and a thick cloth material. Eventually these evolved into a cross between cricket and baseball catcher's leg guard. Like cricket, the irons covered high above the knee, while having an exoskeleton of molded plastic caps and shin plates to deflect shots and leave less or no bruising like in baseball. In the 2000s and 2010s, the size rules for these pads were very much tested as a market emerged for new lacrosse goalie equipment. Irons grew in width until it was arguable that they were no longer designed to protect the shin, but largely to cover more net. Eventually there was a push back, the Canadian Lacrosse Association and its partners set limitations on shin guard wideness.\nUppers and pants.\nUp until about 2005, the distribution and price of lacrosse style upper pads were extremely inhibitive. Until then, goaltenders generally engaged in \"building up\". Building up was a common practice, a goalie would buy a set of hockey uppers and add to them. Hockey uppers generally do not have enough padding to protect from downward shots or from up-bounces from bounce shots, so materials and other pieces of equipment were often added to protect from these, including: Football lineman shoulder pads, hockey shoulder pads, kidney guards, baseball belly guards, sectioned PVC piping (also used in old lacrosse slash guards), and thick cuts of foam. These augmentations were added not only to increase the upper body size of the goalie, but to increase their safety, comfort, but had to still maintain mobility.\nSince about 2005, the Canadian Lacrosse Association has mandated one-piece unmodified chest protectors for all of its goalies. Because of the price, the team or the minor lacrosse organization often flips the bill for this costly piece of equipment. A legal upper should only stand out from the shoulders at any point by three inches and four inches on the arms.\nFor pants, the box goalie generally wears hockey goalie pants or a specially modified version of hockey pants with airflow in mind.\nRules.\nThe box lacrosse goaltender is allowed to play in any area of the playing surface and is not confined to any zone. Despite this, the box goaltender has a crease, around the entire net, all to himself. Defensive players can enter this area to pick up a loose ball but cannot enter it while in possession of the ball. Offensive players cannot enter the crease. At minor levels and some junior leagues this includes the crease's vertical plane, but at the Junior A, Major, and professional levels it is not uncommon for the player to be allowed to enter the vertical plane while shooting or retrieving a rebound as long as his feet or body do not touch the crease paint on the floor. Such a play is called a \"crease dive\".\nOccasionally, a box lacrosse goaltender will run up and join the play in the offensive zone on a slow whistle or delayed penalty, but the goaltender is usually pulled and substituted with a field player. Goaltenders in box lacrosse are known to sometimes score goals for their team, in power play or slow whistle situations. Also, due to the unique lack of offside rules in box lacrosse, it is not unheard of to see a goaltender lead his team in scoring on game sheets through multiple assists, usually through long passes to teammates that are attempting to breakaway on unsuspecting defenders. Box lacrosse goaltenders are also encouraged to be aggressive stick checkers around the ball and ferocious cross-checkers when needed (cross-checking is legal in box lacrosse). If a goaltender leaves the crease with possession of the ball, opponents are allowed to cross-check the goaltender as long as there is no attempt to injure.\nBox lacrosse goalies play in front of a four by four foot net at most levels, unlike a field goalie who plays in front of a six by six net. At the National Lacrosse League, Major, and Junior A levels a net four feet tall and four foot nine inches wide is used.\nStyles.\nGoaltending in box lacrosse tends to be more like goaltending in ice hockey than field lacrosse. The box goalie's stance is similar to an ice hockey goalie. The goalie crouched, but with his knees spread, not pinched like in ice hockey. Heels shoulder-width apart, toes generally pointed on an outward angle to allow for stepping into the shot. One hand sits on top of the thigh, holding the goal stick in a position to cover the five-hole (the area between the legs) and the other hand is resting or propped out in the vicinity between the waistline and the outside of the upper thigh. The elbow is propped out, ready to swing out towards a high shot.\nThe two main styles of box lacrosse goaltending are \"playing the stick\" and \"take away\". The playing the stick or positional style is all about staying on angle with the shooter's stick, challenging the shooter by stepping towards him to limit the amount of net he can see, and using your size to your advantage in blocking the shot. Take away or give-and-take is where the goalie stays on the inside of the post on the same side of the shot of the shooter, giving him the opposite side intentionally. This gives the shooter a bad angle shot that the goalie is trying to force him to take. When the player shoots, the goalie quickly steps across and covers the other side of the net and blocks the shot. This style can be highly effective but can fall victim to fake shots.\nNotable players.\nNational Lacrosse League (1987–Present).\n\"Top goaltenders from modern NLL.\"\nMajor Series Lacrosse (1932–1987).\n\"Top OLA and NLL (1974–75) goaltenders before modern NLL was founded.

        "title": "2014–15 St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2014–15 St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball team represented St. Francis College during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Terrier's home games were played at the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex. They also hosted one home game at Madison Square Garden, defeating Central Connecticut in the second game of a double header that saw St. John's defeat Marquette. The team has been a member of the Northeast Conference since 1981. St. Francis Brooklyn was coached by Glenn Braica, who was in his fifth year at the helm of the Terriers and has made the NEC Tournament each year.\nThe Terriers, for the first time in the program's history, were selected as the preseason 2014–15 NEC favorites by league head coaches. The program was also selected to participate in the 3rd annual 2014 Barclays Center Classic and faced Rutgers, LaSalle, Norfolk State and Tennessee State. The Terriers went 1–3, winning the consolation game of the Campus Site Bracket. St. Francis Brooklyn ended the non-conference portion of their schedule at 6–7 after opening the season with a five-game losing streak.\nOn January 31, 2015, the Terriers gained sole possession of 1st place in the NEC after defeating LIU Brooklyn in the annual Battle of Brooklyn. For St. Francis Brooklyn, it marked the first time being in first place after 10 games since starting 8–2 in the 2003–04 season. That year the Terriers finished 12–6 and shared the NEC regular season title with Monmouth. On February 21, 2015, the Terriers clinched the NEC Regular Season Championship and recorded their first 20+ win season since the 1998–99 season. Prior to the beginning of the NEC Tournament, the NEC announced Glenn Braica as the Jim Phelan Coach of the Year, Jalen Cannon as the NEC Player of the Year and Amdy Fall as the NEC Defensive Player of the Year.\nIn the NEC Tournament, the Terriers defeated LIU Brooklyn and Saint Francis (PA) to reach the Championship game, where they lost to Robert Morris and thus did not secure the NEC's automatic NCAA tournament bid. They did participate in the National Invitational Tournament by virtue of having won the NEC regular season championship. It was the program's first NIT postseason appearance since 1963. The Terriers traveled to Richmond, Virginia to face the Spiders and lost 74–84 in the first round of the NIT. The Terriers ended their season at 23–12 overall, tying the program's record for wins in a season last set in 1953–54.\nHaving fallen just one game short of qualifying for the NCAA tournament, St. Francis remained one of five teams to have never appeared in any NCAA tournament despite being eligible for every edition since the inaugural tournament in 1939 (Northwestern qualified in 2017 to leave just four teams with this distinction.)\nPreseason.\nThe Terriers lost three players to graduation: shooting guard Ben Mockford, center Matt Milk, and forward Aleksander Isailovic. The biggest loss was Mockford, who led the team in 3-point shooting and was second in scoring last season. The Terriers also lost 4 players to transfers: Anthony White, P.J. Santavenere, Wayne Martin and Sheldon Hagigal. These four players were suspended last year because of misconduct and their transfers may be related to the event. Martin, Hagigal and White were critical components to last year's team.\nThe Terriers added 8 players to their roster: Keon Williams, Glenn Sanabria, Gunnar Ólafsson, Chris Hooper, Antonio Jenifer, Jonathan Doss, Marlon Alcindor and Tyreek Jewell. For the 2014–15 season Keon Williams, Jonathan Doss and Marlon Alcindor were redshirts.\nSeason outlook.\nIn Glenn Braica's first four seasons, the Terriers have made the NEC tournament each year. Going into this season Braica has a combined 60–62 overall record and 39–31 conference record. Last year the Terriers earned the fifth seed in the conference, yet for the fourth season in a row the Terriers were eliminated in the quarterfinals. The Terriers, for the first time in the program's history as members of the NEC, were selected as the preseason 2014–15 NEC favorites by league head coaches. St. Francis Brooklyn claimed six first-place votes to finish ahead of Central Connecticut, which earned three first place nods. Braica, now in his fifth year, has stressed defense and rebounding since taking over the program in 2010. Last season, St. Francis Brooklyn led the NEC in scoring defense (66.8) and rebound margin (+3.2/game). They also ranked second in field goal percentage defense (.410), three-point percentage defense (.333) and blocked shots (5.3).\nRegular season.\nNon-conference games.\nNovember.\nThe Terriers opened their schedule on the road against Georgetown, where they were looking to upset in the season opener as they did last year against then reigning ACC Champions Miami (FL). The Terriers ended up losing 83–62 to the Hoyas and the all-time series between the programs is tied at 1–1; the other time they met was during the 1952–53 season in which the Terriers defeated the Hoyas 77–52. Senior Guard Brent Jones led the team in points (13), assists (6) and steals (4,) but also led in turnovers (8). In the Terriers homecoming game, they hosted the Army Black Knights for Military Appreciation Day. The Terriers were led by a strong performance from Cannon, who had his season first double-double, as the game came down to the wire but in the end they lost 71–74. St. Francis then traveled to Piscataway, New Jersey to face the Scarlet Knights as part of the Barclays Center Classic field where they lost 73–76. For the third game in a row the Terriers out-rebounded their opponents but also turned the ball over 17, 20 and 21 times respectively for a 3-game losing streak. Against Rutgers, St. Francis almost pulled out the upset as they were leading with 1:09 to play yet they came up short and were not helped by Cannon's foul trouble limiting him to playing only 12 minutes. The Terriers were aided by surprising performances from newcomers Jewel, Jennifer and Hooper, as Douglas led the team in points and rebounds. At La Salle the Terriers losing streak increased to 4, as they were defeated 60–73. The Terriers were led by Brent Jones (13 Pts, 3 Ast, 2 Reb and 3 Stl) and Jalen Cannon (11 Pts, 13 Reb, 1 Ast, 2 Stl and 1 Blk) yet they could not stop La Salle's Jordan Price, who scored 30 points. St. Francis then traveled to Jersey City, New Jersey to participate in the campus portion of the Barclays Center Classic at the Yanitelli Center, home of the Saint Peter's Peacocks. In the opening round they faced Norfolk State losing 70–72 in overtime, as they were led by Jalen Cannon (23 Pts, 9 Reb and 3 Stl). The loss extended the Terriers losing streak to 5 games making it the first time since the 2011–12 season that they opened a season 0–5. The Terriers five opponents have a combined 19–6 record thus far and the Terriers have lost three of the five contests by three points or less. With the loss the Terriers then faced Tennessee State in the consolation game of the Barclays Center Classic, where they won 59–57 for their first victory of the season. The team was again led by Jalen Cannon (15 Pts, 14 Reb, 1 Ast, 2 Blk) with help from Brent Jones and Kevin Douglas. The Terriers closed out the month 1–5, playing 5 games away from the Pope.\nDecember.\nSt. Francis extended its win streak to 2 games by defeating Liberty 65–54, as they were led by Cannon's and Jones' 16 points apiece. The Terriers then snapped their win streak with a 66–68 loss to NJIT, which had just come off defeating then #17 ranked Michigan. St. Francis next faced Mount St. Vincent at home where they won 90–72 as they were led by Brent Jones (25 Pts, 6 Reb, 6 Ast, 2 Stl) and Jalen Cannon (18 Pts, 12 Reb, 3 Ast, 2 Stl, 5 Blk). For only the third time so far this season the Terriers played at home, against Delaware State where they lost 64–72. The Terriers were once again led by Jalen Cannon (16 Pts, 10 Reb, 1 Ast, 2 Blk) who recorded his fifth double-double of the season. The squad was stagnant on offense, only shooting 37% from the floor and 14% from 3-point range and their defense while solid, out rebounding the Hornets by a 45–25 margin, could not slow down Delaware State senior Amere May, who scored 48 points (an NCAA D-I season high). The Terriers then went on a three-game win streak to close out their non-conference schedule by defeating Florida Atlantic, Monmouth and Columbia. Against Florida Atlantic, St. Francis won 61–56 as they were led by Cannon (17 Pts, 10 Reb, 2 Ast, 2 Stl). Florida Atlantic had won its previous 4 contest prior to losing to St. Francis in a close contest. At Monmouth the Terriers were again led by Cannon (16 Pts, 13 Reb, 1 Stl, 1 Blk) who has an NEC-leading seven \"double-doubles\" and became the Terriers' all-time leader in made free throws and now has 340 for his career. St. Francis defeated the Hawks 71–46 in their most lopsided victory of the season. St. Francis closed out their non-conference schedule by hosting Columbia and defeating them 72–64. St. Francis Brooklyn led from start to finish en route to perhaps their most impressive victory of the season as they answered every run by the visitors and were led by Brent Jones (19 Pts, 2 Reb, 3 Ast, 1 Stl) and Jalen Cannon (15 Pts, 12 Reb, 5 Ast, 1 Blk). The Terriers closed out the month at 5–2 and 6–7 overall.\nNortheast Conference games.\nJanuary.\nSt. Francis Brooklyn, who trailed by as many as 18 points late in the first half against Sacred Heart, improved to 7–7 and have won five straight conference openers dating to the 2010–11 season. It was their fourth straight victory of the season and seventh in their last nine outings. St. Francis senior forward Jalen Cannon produced his sixth straight \"double-double\" with 21 points and 13 rebounds to lead the way in their 73–71 victory. The Terriers then faced Bryant, and extended their win streak to 5 games as they defeated them 63–47. Junior Amdy Fall recorded his second \"double-double\" of the season with 11 points and 10 rebounds to go along with a game-high four blocks. Junior forward Tyreek Jewell led the hosts with 15 points and senior guard Brent Jones added 13 points and a game-high six assists. Jones also became just the second player in St. Francis Brooklyn history (Greg Nunn, 1997-2001) to reach 500 points and 500 assists when he found Jewell on an inbounds pass early in the second-half. The Terriers never trailed in the contest and led by as many as 20 points with 3:13 remaining in the opening half. The St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers won their sixth consecutive contest as they defeated the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights, 78–69 at Stratis Arena. The Terriers improved to 9–7 (3–0 NEC) while the Knights fell to 7–7 (2–1 NEC). Senior forward Jalen Cannon recorded a game-high 19 points on 7-of-8 shooting and also grabbed nine boards to pace the Terriers. Senior guard Brent Jones produced 14 points and five assists and freshman guard Glenn Sanabria recorded 12 points and five helpers. In their next contest the Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers defeated St. Francis Brooklyn, 71–61, putting an end to the Terriers six-game winning streak. Senior forward Jalen Cannon led the Terriers with 19 points and 13 rebounds and eclipsed the 1,400 point mark for his career. Junior guard Tyreek Jewell added 14 points and senior guard Brent Jones contributed 13 points and a team-high five assists. The Terriers then rebounded against Robert Morris in a nationally televised contest that saw St. Francis come from behind on the road and win 68–63 at the Sewall Center. Senior guard Brent Jones scored 21 of his game-high 23 points in the second half to lead the Terriers to the victory. The Terriers are now 10–8 (4–1 NEC) and Robert Morris fell to 7–10 (3–2 NEC). Senior forward Jalen Cannon led the Terriers with eight rebounds and moved into sixth-place all-time in NEC history with 966 rebounds. St. Francis Brooklyn next traveled to Loretto, Pennsylvania to face the Saint Francis University Red Flash in a first place battle. Chris Hooper put up a buzzer-beating shot with one tenth of a second remaining to give the visiting Terriers a thrilling 60–59 victory. The Terriers were led by Brent Jones (20 Pts, 1 Reb, 2 Ast, 4 Stl) and got a strong performance by Tyreek Jewell (10 Pts, 4 Reb, 1 Stl) and Hooper (11 Pts, 6 Reb). St. Francis Brooklyn then hosted Central Connecticut at Madison Square Garden, where they beat them 63–51. The team was led by the senior duo of Brent Jones (22 Pts, 3 Reb, 6 Ast, 2 Stl) and Jalen Cannon (15 Pts, 6 Reb, 1 Ast, 3 Stl, 1 Blk) with good performances by Tyreek Jewell (14 Pts, 4 Reb, 1 Ast, 1 Stl) and Amdy Fall (6 Pts, 6 Reb, 4 Blk). The Terriers also saw the return of senior swingman Kevin Douglas, who missed the previous 6 games due to injury. In their next match, St. Francis Brooklyn saw an end to their 3-game win streak against Robert Morris at The Pope, losing 65–57. The game saw Brent Jones become the programs all-time assists leader with 536 for his career. The Terriers then faced Mount St. Mary's, who had won 4 straight contests against the Terriers, and defeated them 73–67 in overtime to snap their losing streak against the Mountaineers. They were trailing by three points at the end of the second half when Freshman Guard Glenn Sanabria hit a 3-pointer to tie up the game at 63–63 and force overtime where the Terriers took the lead and sealed the win on a last second block by Junior Forward Amdy Fall. St. Francis Brooklyn was led by Jalen Cannon who scored a career-high 26 points and recorded 13 rebounds to become just the second player in program history and fourth in Northeast Conference history to grab 1,000 rebounds. The St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers next hosted the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds in the 40th annual Battle of Brooklyn where they won 81–64. Four Terriers scored in double digits, including Brent Jones (15 Pts, 4 Reb, 8 Ast, 1 Stl, 1 Blk) who was named the game's Lai-Lynch MVP. St. Francis finished the month at 8–2 and improved to 14–9 overall for sole possession of first place atop the NEC conference.\nFebruary.\nThe Terriers opened the month with 7 victories and extended their win streak to nine games, their longest of the season. At Central Connecticut, the Terriers won 90–81 matching their season-high point total. St. Francis Brooklyn was led by Jalen Cannon's career-high 35 points and 13 rebounds, which led to him becoming the Terriers' all-time leading rebounder (1,028) surpassing Jerome Williams. He also became just the second player in NEC and first player in program history with at least 1,500 points and 1,000 rebounds. Teammate Brent Jones (14 points, 7 assists) joined the 1,000 point club and became the first player in St. Francis Brooklyn history with 1,000 points and 500 assists. At Wagner, St. Francis Brooklyn won 66–51 behind Jalen Cannon's game-high 29 points. Cannon also became the Northeast Conference all-time leader in rebounds by surpassing Justin Rutty's (Quinnipiac, 2007-2011) previous mark of 1,032 rebounds with a rebound early in the second-half. The Terriers faced the Seahawks again at The Pope and defeated them 83–66, behind another big performance by Jalen Cannon (26 Pts, 12 Reb, 1 Ast, 1 Stl, 1 Blk). St. Francis Brooklyn then hosted Sacred Heart and won 71–62, this time led by Chris Hooper (16 Pts, 6 Reb, 3 Stl, 3 Blk). With the win, the Terriers were in first place with a 3-game lead and 4 games left to play in the season. The Terriers then faced Fairleigh Dickinson at The Pope and won 70–54 behind Jalen Cannon's 27-point performance. The win was not the squads prettiest as they shot 38.5% from the field but the Terriers were able to out-rebound the Knights by 33 caroms. With the win the Terriers are 19–9 and have won 19 of their last 23 outings. St. Francis Brooklyn then clinched the NEC Regular Season Championship with their twentieth win of the season against the Saint Francis Red Flash, 66–54. It is the Terriers third NEC Regular Season Championship and their first since the 2003-04 season, with it they have home court advantage throughout the NEC Tournament. Against the Red Flash, the Terriers were led by the senior duo of Jalen Cannon (23 Pts, 15 Reb, 1 Ast) and Brent Jones (15 Pts, 5 Reb, 4 Ast, 1 Stl), who were honored before the game along with Kevin Douglas and Lowell Ulmer on Senior Night. The Terriers next traveled to LIU Brooklyn and won 74–69 in overtime as they were led by Jalen Cannon (26 Pts, 15 Reb, 2 Stl, 1 Blk) who became the programs all-time leading scorer in his effort. St Francis Brooklyn closed out their regular season at Bryant where they were dealt a 51–61 loss. The team was led by Kevin Douglas (13 Pts, 6 Reb, 1 Blk) and team leader Jalen Cannon only saw 10 minutes of action in the contest. The Terriers closed out the month 7–1, 21–10 overall, and 15–3 in conference play. They will host 8th seed LIU Brooklyn in the NEC Tournament quarterfinals.\nNEC Tournament.\nPrior to the beginning of the conference tournament, the NEC announced Glenn Braica as the Jim Phelan Coach of the Year, Jalen Cannon as the NEC Player of the Year and Amdy Fall as the NEC Defensive Player of the Year.

It marks the programs first NEC Quarterfinals win since the 2002–03 season and their 22nd victory on the year. The Terriers then faced Saint Francis (PA) in the semifinals where they won 62–48 behind Jalen Cannon's 20th double-double of the season (20 Pts, 11 Rebs). With the win, the Terriers tied their program record for victories in a single-season, 23, first set in the 1953–54 season. In the championship game the Terriers lost to Robert Morris, 63–66. The team was led by Tyreek Jewell (19 Pts, 5 Reb, 4 Ast, 1 Stl, 1 Blk) and by Jalen Cannon (10 Pts, 12 Reb, 1 Stl).\nPost-season Tournament.\nBy virtue of having won the NEC regular season championship, the Terriers will participate in the National Invitational tournament. It is the programs first NIT postseason appearance since 1963 and they will travel to face top-seeded Richmond in the first round. The Terriers put up a good fight and were down by 2 points with less than 3 minutes to play but they lost 74–84, behind impressive performances from Brent Jones (19 Pts, 4 Reb, 5 Ast) and Chris Hooper (16 Pts, 11 Reb, 1 Ast, 2 Stl).\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Northeast Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Northeast Conference tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:#FFFFFF;\"| National Invitation Tournament"

        "text": "The Buffalo Bulls women's volleyball team represents the University at Buffalo in NCAA Division I college volleyball. The team participates in the East Division of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The Bulls are currently led by first year coach Scott Smith, who took over in 2019 when the previous coach, Blair Brown Lipsitz, resigned. Smith was an assistant for four years under Lipsitz, and this is his first head coaching job at the NCAA level. The team plays its home games at Alumni Arena, located on the university's campus.\nRecent history.\nIn 2013, under head coach Todd Kress, Buffalo finished 6–10 in the MAC, which was their most wins ever in conference; however, they finished ninth in conference because of unfavorable tie-breakers and so the Bulls did not advance to the Conference Tournament (only the top 8 teams advance). Kress was fired after the season.\nIn 2014, under head coach Reed Sunahara, Buffalo finished 6–10 again, but this time they were eighth in the conference, and for the first time in program history, the Bulls qualified for the round of eight in the Conference Tournament. Buffalo lost to Western Michigan 3–0 in that tournament game. Sunahara resigned to coach at West Virginia.\nBuffalo hired Lipsitz, who had never coached before at the collegiate level. Buffalo finished the 2015 season at 6–10 in the MAC again, but this time it was good for seventh place based on tie-breakers, the team's highest finish ever in the MAC. In the MAC Tournament, Buffalo lost to Ball State 3–1, marking the first-ever victory in a set in a MAC Tournament Round of 8 match in the team's history. In 2016, Buffalo struggled and finished 3–13 in the MAC and did not make the MAC tournament. In 2017, Buffalo had its best year ever in the MAC, passing the previous high of 6 wins, with an 8–8 record and the #5 seed into the MAC tournament. In 2018, Buffalo again surpassed its previous win record in the MAC, finishing 10–6, and had the #4 seed in the MAC tournament. The Bulls did not win a MAC tournament match under Lipsitz.\nIn 2019, after a 1–5 start, Smith coached the Bulls to an 8–8 record in the MAC, defeating three teams that were leading the MAC at the time of the match. Buffalo would be the #7 seed in the MAC Tournament, and they won their very first ever MAC Tournament \"Round of 8\" match, defeating #6 Akron 3–0. The Bulls then lost in the next round.\nMAC honorees.\nBuffalo has had several players in recent history earn All-MAC honors. In 2011, right-side hitter Liz Scott was named to the All-MAC Freshman team. In 2012, Scott was named to the All-MAC Second team. In 2013 and 2014, outside hitter Tahleia Bishop was named First Team All-MAC. In 2013, libero Kelly Svoboda was also named First Team All-MAC. The awards to Bishop and Svoboda in 2013 were the first-ever First Team All-MAC awards for any Bull. In addition, Svoboda was named MAC Defensive Player of the Year, the only Bull to ever win a MAC individual honor in volleyball. In 2014, middle blocker Cassie Shado was named to the All-MAC Freshman team, and in 2015 Shado and senior outside hitter Megan Lipski were named All-MAC Honorable Mention."

        "text": "The 1907–08 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1907-08 Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States college basketball season. Maurice Joyce coached the team in his first season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at the Convention Hall at 5th and K Streets NW in downtown Washington, D.C.\nJoyce had introduced the new sport of basketball to Washington, D.C., in 1892 – the year after its invention by James Naismith – and had fostered its development there over the next 15 years as Director of Physical Education at the Carroll Institute. In the autumn of 1906, Georgetown had hired him as its athletic director with an eye toward developing a men's basketball program at the school, and he had founded the program late that year, in time to field Georgetowns first team in the 1906-07 season. That team had had no coach, relying instead on an elected student manager to provide leadership, monitor the teams finances, and schedule games and practices – roles now performed by the schools athletic department and coach. For Georgetowns second season in 1907-08, Joyce formally became the teams first head coach, although this did not diminish the role of the student manager, who continued in his duties; rather, the head coach acted as a teacher and faculty advisor, available to provide advice to the players during games rather than lead the team on the court. It was not until the late 1920s that the modern role of the head coach as in-game leader emerged.\nSeason recap.\nDuring its inaugural season in 1906-07, Georgetown had played only four games, three of them against George Washington. George Washington had won two of the three games, led by center Fred Rice. When George Washington decided not to field a basketball team for the 1907-08 season, Joyce convinced Rice to enroll in Georgetown University Law School and play for the Hoyas in 1907-08.\nIn a low-scoring era, Rice got off to a spectacular start with his new team, scoring 20 or more points in four of his first seven games. Starting all seven games he played, he had no free-throw attempts, but he scored 52 field goals, giving him 104 points and an average of 14.9 points per game; only one other Georgetown player would equal his per-game scoring average in the next 35 years. Rice would star for Georgetown for two more seasons before graduating from the Law School.\nConsidered the first great team in Georgetown men's basketball history, the 1907-08 squad won its first five games before losing an exhibition game to Rutgers and suffering its only regular-season loss to a Pennsylvania team that went 23-4 for the year. The Hoyas finished the season with a record of 5-1 and won the mythical \"Champions of the South\" title for the year.\nRoster.\nSources\n1907–08 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

        "text": "Bill Bradford Clark (born June 28, 1968) is a retired American football coach. He was the head football coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). He held the position from 2014 season until June 24, 2022, when he retired because of health issues related to his back.\nCareer.\nClark was born in Anniston, Alabama and grew up in Piedmont, Alabama, where he graduated from Piedmont High School. A pivotal moment in his life occurred during a summer workout between his freshman and sophomore years. He suffered a back injury while attempting to squat an excessive amount of weight. The injury worsened as he continued to play through it. After the pain reached an intolerable level, he consulted local orthopedic surgeon James Andrews, who would later become famous for treating athletes such as Michael Jordan and Brett Favre. Andrews told Clark that his spine was too seriously injured for him to play football, and that surgery (which was less advanced in the mid-1980s than today) was risky.\nClark started his coaching career as an offensive line coach at his alma mater of Piedmont High immediately out of college. From there, he moved to assistant posts at several other high schools until getting his first head coaching job at Prattville High School in Prattville, Alabama. During his tenure at Prattville, Clark compiled an overall record of 106 wins to only 11 losses (106–11) and won back-to-back Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) state championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, Clark was hired to serve as the first defensive coordinator at South Alabama. He stayed in that role through the 2012 season when he was hired as head coach at Jacksonville State. During his only season as head coach at Jacksonville State, Clark led the Gamecocks to their first playoff victories, 49 school records, 13 OVC records and three NCAA records. In January 2014, Clark was hired to serve as the fifth head coach at UAB following the resignation of Garrick McGee.\nOn December 2, 2014, UAB president Ray L. Watts announced that, after commissioning an in-depth inspection of UAB's athletic budget and revenue and how the elimination of football from the athletic program would affect those, UAB had decided to close down the football program in order to save money. On June 1, 2015 news reported that the UAB Blazers football program would be reinstated. That September, Clark and UAB agreed to a five-year contract extension.\nHowever, Clark was left with a bare-bones staff with virtually no players, since the team would not resume play until 2017. According to a 2022 story by ESPN journalist Alex Scarborough,\nThe Blazers would go on to win the Conference USA (C-USA) West Division in each of the next three seasons, including wins in the 2018 and 2020 C-USA championship games. Clark's final game as Blazers head coach was a win over nationally ranked BYU in the 2021 Independence Bowl, the end of a season that also saw the Blazers open the new Protective Stadium and announce a 2023 move to the American Athletic Conference.\nAfter seven years coaching at UAB, Clark resigned in June 24, 2022 citing back problems. He underwent successful spinal fusion surgery shortly after his retirement.\nHead coaching record.\nCollege.\n \n "

        "text": "The 1906–07 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1906-07 Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States college basketball season. It was the first men's team in Georgetown basketball history. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at the Washington Light Infantry Armory at 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW in downtown Washington, D.C., finishing the season with a record of 2-2.\nFounding of the team.\nMaurice Joyce had introduced the new sport of basketball to Washington, D.C., in 1892 – the year after its invention by James Naismith – and had fostered its development there over the next 15 years as Director of Physical Education at the Carroll Institute; he also had spearheaded the move to reduce the size of teams from nine players on the court for each side to five, which Naismith and a national rules committee approved in 1897. Although an intramural basketball game took place at Georgetown in 1904, the sport otherwise remained unknown at the school until the autumn of 1906, when Georgetown hired Joyce as its athletic director with an eye toward developing a men's basketball program. After the football season ended later that autumn, Joyce oversaw tryouts for a basketball team; ultimately four undergraduates and three Georgetown University Law School students made the team.\nThe team had no head coach, the only team in Georgetown mens basketball history that did not have one. Instead, college student Lou Murray was elected student manager of the team, responsible for providing leadership, monitoring the teams finances, and scheduling games and practices – roles now performed by the schools athletic department and coach. The role of student manager would remain a prominent one in the seasons to come, as even after Joyce became the teams first formal head coach the following season, he and future head coaches for many years limited their role to that of teacher and faculty advisor, available to the team during games merely to offer advice if the players asked for it; it was not until the late 1920s that the modern role of the head coach as in-game leader emerged.\nSeason recap.\nThe new basketball team began practices early in January 1907, and Murray arranged a game against highly rated Virginia and three against George Washington for the first season. The first intercollegiate game in Georgetown history took place on February 9, 1907, before a large crowd at the Washington Light Infantry Armory; center Richard Downey scored a game-high eight points and held the opposing center scoreless throughout the game, and Virginia managed only a single field goal in the second half thanks to the defense of forwards Sam Simon and Harold Schumm, allowing Georgetown to extend a 10-9 halftime lead into a 22-11 upset victory.\nThe next game – on February 27, 1907 – was against George Washington, whose star forward Fred Rice was ill and unable to play. After Georgetown took a 16-11 lead at the half, George Washington head coach E. Blanchard Robey spotted Rice in the crowd and convinced him to enter the game when play resumed. With Rice in the game, the Hoyas failed to score in the second half; Rice made the basket that tied the game at 16, and George Washington went on to hand Georgetown its first intercollegiate loss, 18-16. It was the first time that George Washington had defeated its crosstown rival Georgetown in any intercollegiate event, and the raucous celebration George Washington fans started in the stands continued in the streets of Washington as they left the game.\nGeorge Washington came to the Washington Light Infantry Armory for Georgetowns third game on March 2, 1907, witnessed by a crowd of 1,100 – enormous for a college athletic event in Washington by 1907 standards. Basketballs rules were not as clearly established in 1907 as they later became, and the game was delayed for an hour while Joyce and Robey negotiated over them. The crowd occupied itself with loud cheering during the delay, and the cheering became louder after the manager of a theater next door threatened to have play stopped if the crowd continued to make so much noise. Fred Rice played poorly in the first half, missing all five free throws he attempted and scoring no field goals, and Georgetown led 8-4 at halftime. Rice scored the first five George Washington points of the second half to reduce the Hoyas lead to 10-9. With Georgetown leading 15-13 with less than a minute to go, George Washington held the ball for the final shot in an attempt to tie the game and force overtime, but the shot went through the basket after time had expired. This time, a Georgetown celebration spilled out into the streets.\nGeorgetowns fourth and final game of the season, also against George Washington, was postponed until March 16, 1907. By then some of Georgetowns players had left the basketball team to take part in spring sports, and Fred Rice starred in a 22-10 (or 24-10) George Washington victory.\nWhen George Washington decided not to field a basketball team for the 1907-08 season, Joyce convinced Fred Rice to enroll in Georgetown University Law School and play for the Hoyas. Rice would go on to star for Georgetown for three seasons before graduating from the Law School.\nRoster.\nSources\n1906–07 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season"

Italy, whose doubles team of Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner won the first run, protested to event officials the results should stand since all contestants had suffered equally, but to no avail. After the protest was denied, a rerun was ordered.\nHildgartner and Plaikner won the first run of the rerun event while the East German team of Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow had the fastest second run. The combined times were equal for the only time in Winter Olympic luge history. The International Luge Federation consulted with IOC President Avery Brundage on this matter, and gold medals were awarded to both teams as a result. By the time of the 1976 Winter Olympics, artificial track luge would be timed in thousandths of a second (0.001) rather than hundredths of a second (0.01) in an effort to avoid ties. That would prove effective until the FIL European Luge Championships 2008 at Cesana, when another tie occurred. This tie was again in the men's doubles event and it again involved Italy and Germany (East and West Germany reunified in 1990) only this time it was for a bronze medal rather than gold."

The 2014 season consisted of 20 individual title events plus a \"PBA League\" team title event. The 2014 season is the first season since 2000 to follow a calendar year schedule.\nTournament schedule and recaps.\nFor the sixth year in a row, the PBA held the fall North American events in one location at the PBA World Series of Bowling VI (WSOB VI). Preliminary rounds and match play took place October 24 through October 31, with taping of the final televised rounds on November 2. The four standard \"animal pattern\" tournaments in WSOB VI served as the initial qualifying rounds for the PBA World Championship. After 28 qualifying games (7 per pattern tournament), the top 24 bowlers (in total pinfall) bowled an additional 24 games of match play (three rounds of eight games) to determine the top five players for the TV finals. The World Championship returned to a split format, as in . After the match play rounds at WSOB VI, the stepladder finals were held live on January 11, 2015.\nFollowing the WSOB, the Round1 Japan Cup invitational tournament took place in Japan, with a final televised round on November 15. Several international tour stops, which are part of the World Bowling Tour (WBT), were again part of the PBA Tour schedule. As in 2012–13, a PBA title is awarded if any of these stops are won by a PBA member.\nNotably absent from the PBA schedule in 2014 is the \"U.S. Open\". The event was not hosted in 2014, as the BPAA (the tournament's primary sponsor) was unable to find additional sponsorship.\nTournament summary.\nBelow is a schedule of events for the 2014 PBA Tour season.

        "title": "Ron Baker (basketball)",
        "text": "Ronald Delaine Baker (born March 30, 1993) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the Wichita State Shockers. Going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, he spent 3 seasons in the NBA, playing for the New York Knicks and Washington Wizards.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Hays, Kansas, Baker spent his early childhood in the tiny farming town of Utica, Kansas, growing up with one sister and one brother. In a 2014 interview, he recalled, \"I have memories of when was I very, very little, holding a basketball in my dog's doghouse when I was about 1.\" His father noted that he eventually gravitated toward basketball for practical reasons: \"It was easier to haul him around and easier to get five or six to play basketball than to play baseball, where you'd need 12 to 14.\"\nHigh school career.\nWhile he developed into a star at Scott Community High, and dreamed of playing for the state's premier college program at Kansas, he was slow to grow into his body; by the end of his junior year, he was only 6 feet (1.83 m) tall, and had drawn interest from only two Division I programs: Arkansas–Little Rock and South Dakota State. However, he grew to 6-3 (1.91 m) during the summer between his junior and senior seasons.\nIn his senior year, Baker helped the team finish with a 25–1 record. In return, he was named 3A First-Team All-State in Kansas. The peak of his high school basketball career was when he hit a game winning put-back buzzer beater against Minneapolis High School to win the Class 3A state basketball championship, finishing the game with 26 points and 9 rebounds. As a result, Baker helped the school win its first ever Class 3A Championship, although the school had made two different appearances in the past.\nNonetheless, Baker remained little-known among Division I coaches. \"ESPN.com\" writer Eamonn Brennan noted in 2014,\nESPN's RecruitingNation maintains detailed scouting reports on hundreds of the best high school basketball players in the country. . . . Ron Baker's profile read as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"Will walk-on at Wichita State in 2011–12 and spend a redshirt year. Expected to be on scholarship starting in 2012–13.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that was it. Next to Baker's name was \"NR,\" which stands for \"Not Ranked.\" The same abbreviation sits next to secondary lists for \"position,\" \"regional\" and \"state.\" Baker — who requested a redshirt year when he committed, as a walk-on, to Wichita State in April 2011 — couldn't have been more off the recruiting radar.\nAfter his senior season, Kansas invited him to visit the campus. Baker had thoughts about walking on there, but the invitation occurred during the middle of his high school baseball season. Baker's father recalled that Ron felt that his basketball game was rusty, and that \"he didn't want to embarrass himself\" in a potential scrimmage.\nCollege career.\nBaker chose to play for the Wichita State Shockers after also having interest in Arkansas–Little Rock, Eastern Illinois, and South Dakota State. Rather than playing in his first season with the Shockers, Baker redshirted after a reluctant approval from head coach Gregg Marshall.\nIn his first season, Baker emerged as one of the elite free-throw shooters on Wichita State. He finished the season shooting for a free-throw percentage of .822, the highest for a qualified player on the team. Baker did not prove himself to be an efficient scorer and played just eighteen games in the entire season due to a stress fracture in his left foot. He eventually played a major role when the Shockers made an unanticipated run into the semifinals of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Baker shot 40 percent from the field, 42.9 percent on three-pointers, most notably scoring 16 points in a huge win over No. 1 Gonzaga (tied for team-high). He earned no major awards by the time the season came to a close.\nEntering the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Baker became known as one of the MVC's premier shooters. He, Cleanthony Early, and Fred VanVleet led the team in scoring and had a major influence on Wichita State's season, which saw the Shockers become the first NCAA Division I men's team to enter the NCAA tournament undefeated in over 20 years. Baker was named to the 2014 MVC All-Conference First Team and the CBE Hall of Fame Classic's Most Valuable Player after finishing his first season with a double-digit scoring average. After the Shockers' season ended in the NCAA tournament at the hands of Kentucky and its highly touted freshman class, Baker indicated that one of the Wildcats' top recruits, Aaron Harrison, told him, \"You are a bad, bad, bad boy.\"\nHe was a part of three Missouri Valley Conference championships (2013, 2014, 2015), nine NCAA Tournament wins, two trips to the Sweet 16 (2013, 2015) and a trip to the 2013 Final Four. As a senior in 2015–16, he averaged 14.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.51 steals over 31.6 minutes in 35 games. His postseason honors included: John R. Wooden Second Team All-American; USA Today Second Team All-American and 2015 finalist for Jerry West Award. Baker also represented the United States at the 2015 Pan American games, where he started all five games and won a bronze medal.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Knicks (2016–2018).\nAfter going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Baker joined the New York Knicks for the 2016 NBA Summer League. Despite a scattered Summer League campaign, Baker signed with the Knicks on August 1, 2016, and secured an opening-night roster spot. He made his debut for the Knicks in their season opener on October 25, 2016, recording five points and one rebound in seven minutes off the bench in a 117–88 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On December 15, 2016, he scored a career-high 13 points in a 103–90 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On January 16, 2017, he made his first career start for the Knicks and subsequently scored 12 points in a 108–107 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. During his rookie and sophomore seasons, in which he became a fan favorite, he was assigned multiple times to New York's D-League/G League affiliate, the Westchester Knicks.\nOn August 7, 2017, Baker re-signed with the Knicks. Baker missed the Knicks' game on January 2, 2018 against the San Antonio Spurs because of a broken left orbital bone sustained when he was hit in the face trying to stop Anthony Davis' drive to the basket in New York's victory against the New Orleans Pelicans on December 30. On February 5, 2018, he was ruled out for the rest of the season after it was determined he required right shoulder surgery. Baker was waived by the Knicks on December 13, 2018.\nWashington Wizards (2018–2019).\nOn December 20, 2018, Baker signed with the Washington Wizards. He was waived on January 7, 2019 after appearing in four games.\nCSKA Moscow (2019–2020).\nOn August 1, 2019, he signed a contract with CSKA Moscow of the VTB United League and the EuroLeague. Baker averaged 2.5 points per game in 27 EuroLeague games. On May 27, 2020, he parted ways with the team.\nNational team career.\nBaker represented the United States national team at the 2015 Pan American Games, where he won a bronze medal.\nRetirement.\nIn a May 2021 episode of \"Inside TBT\", the official podcast of The Basketball Tournament, Baker indicated that he had retired from play. He told the hosts that he had undergone hip surgery while overseas, and wanted to move on with his life, with hopes of entering the business world. He is serving as general manager of AfterShocks, a TBT team made up mostly of Wichita State basketball alumni, in the 2021 TBT. Baker also emphasized that he would not play in this or any future edition of TBT.\nIn August 2021, Baker was named project manager in the strategy and business development department at a medical center, Ascension Via Christi, in Wichita, Kansas.\nPersonal life.\nBaker is an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. Following the 2015–16 season, Baker was contacted by the owner of a small publishing house in El Dorado, Kansas, who wanted him to write a children's book. The final product, \"You're Too Big to Dream Small\", is an illustrated book with rhyming text written primarily by Baker himself and based closely on his life. It was released on August 3, 2016, and Baker personally signed the first print run of 6,000 copies.\nRon Baker married Liv Nielsen in 2023. He welcomed his first child, a baby girl with his wife in February, 2024."

        "text": "The 2014 Super League Grand Final was the 17th official Grand Final and conclusive and deciding match of Super League XIX. It was held on Saturday 11 October 2014, at Old Trafford, Manchester with a 6pm kick-off time. The game was played between the top two teams from the regular season, St Helens RLFC and Wigan Warriors.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 Super League season (known as the First Utility Super League XIX due to sponsorship by First Utility) was the 19th season of rugby league football since the Super League format was introduced in 1996. Fourteen teams competed for the League Leaders' Shield over 27 rounds (including the Magic Weekend in Manchester), after which the highest finishing teams will enter the play-offs to compete for a place in the Grand Final and a chance to win the championship and the Super League Trophy.\nMatch details.\n Following a fiery opening that started with the kind of big tackles that this derby game has become known for, the game suffered a dramatic twist in only the second minute of the game when Wigan Prop, Ben Flower, became the first and only player to be sent off in a grand final by referee Phil Bentham after he punched Lance Hohaia in the face, thus knocking him out, then as he lay defenceless on the floor, he punched him in the face again. \nThis forced Wigan to play 78 minutes with 12-men, causing a switch in the Wigan approach to one of smash-and-grab. A valiant first-half performance by Wigan's 12-men meant they entered the break with a 6–2 lead.\nDespite further strong defensive displays by the Wigan outfit in the ensuing second-half, Iosia Soliola forced himself over the Wigan try-line in his final appearance in the Red-Vee to put St. Helens ahead, and in control of the game. An admirable, yet desperate display by Wigan, to get themselves back into contention was halted, when Tommy Makinson crashed over for Saints, 12 minutes from time to make the score 14–6, after a precise kick over-the-top of the Wigan defence from Saints stalwart, Paul Wellens. Despite a late Wigan flurry, Makinson's try proved to be the one that sealed the game and the championship for St. Helens, meaning that the Saints claimed their first championship title since 2006, and their sixth overall in the Super League era (St Helens are now equal with Leeds Rhinos for titles since 1996, both have 6 titles).\nWorld Club Series.\nBy winning this match the Saints had qualified for the World Club Series Final, to be played early in the 2015 season against the winners of the 2014 NRL Grand final, the South Sydney Rabbitohs."

        "text": "Paul Carter (born 23 May 1992) is an Australian professional rugby league footballer who last played for the Sydney Roosters in the NRL. He primarily plays at and , but can also fill in at . He previously played for the Gold Coast Titans, South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Sydney Roosters.\nBackground.\nBorn in Penrith, New South Wales, Carter played his junior rugby league for the Wyong Roos, before being signed by the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nCarter is the son of former Penrith Panthers and Widnes Vikings player Steve Carter.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Carter played for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs' NYC team. In November and December 2010, he played for the Australian Schoolboys. On 21 April 2012, he played for the New South Wales Under-20s team in New South Wales' 18–14 win over Queensland at Penrith Stadium. On 21 August 2012, he was named at lock in the 2012 NYC Team of the Year. \nOn 17 July 2013, he played for the New South Wales Residents against the Queensland Residents.\n2014.\nOn 14 August 2013, Carter signed a 2-year contract with the Gold Coast Titans starting in 2014. In February 2014, he played for the Titans in the inaugural NRL Auckland Nines. In Round 1 of the 2014 NRL season, he made his NRL debut for the Titans against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks off the interchange bench in the Titans' 18–12 win at Remondis Stadium. In Round 3 against the Canberra Raiders, he scored his first career try in the Titans 24–12 win at Canberra Stadium. On 12 June 2014, he was stood down by the Titans for 2 matches after being charged with high range drink driving at Surfers Paradise. He later returned to the Titans first-grade squad in Round 17 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, playing at lock in the Titans 14–10 win at ANZ Stadium. He finished off his debut year in the NRL, having played in 21 matches and scoring 1 try for the Titans. On 20 December 2014, his Titans contract was terminated due to disciplinary reasons.\n2015.\nOn 15 June 2015, Carter signed a -year contract with the South Sydney Rabbitohs effective immediately. He made his Rabbitohs debut in Round 23 against the North Queensland Cowboys.\n2016.\nOn 12 July, Carter had his Rabbitohs contract terminated following a breach of the club's code of conduct and specific clauses of his contract. In October, he signed a 1-year contract with the Sydney Roosters starting in 2017.\n2017.\nOn 7 June, Carter was released from the Roosters effective immediately and without comment. On 13 July 2017 it was revealed that Carter was playing for The Coffs Harbour Comets on The NSW Mid North Coast in The Group 2 division. In November 2017, it was announced that The Cessnock Goannas were attempting to sign Carter on a 2-year contract but were told by The CRL that Carter had his registration as a player cancelled. CRL Operations Manager Bert Lowrie said \"Carter has been deregistered by the board \"based on his history\" and \"will remain that way until he makes an application to be registered\".\nMisconduct.\nCarter's career has been marred by alcohol abuse, which led to his contracts with the Gold Coast and South Sydney being torn up.\nIn 2014 season (while contracted with the Gold Coast) Carter was twice charged with drink driving. His first charge was in June, the Court gave him a $14,000 fine and suspended him from driving for 12 months. In December (six months later) he was charged with high-range drink driving while driving unlicensed. Following the incident Coach Neil Henry commented that \"Paul has had an opportunity... we've put measures in place to help him out with a few of the issues he has and he was making some progress but to go and transgress again, especially when the courts have said he's unlicensed, that's unacceptable\".\nIn July 2016 (while contracted with South Sydney) Carter was sacked because he failed to attend a training session following a weekend bender. This was not Carter's first breach of conduct with the club. A month earlier (June 2016) Carter and teammate Kirisome Auva'a were both stood down for turning up to training under the influence of alcohol.\nFollowing Carter's sacking by South Sydney, he checked into an alcohol rehabilitation centre in Thailand.\nOn 11 October 2017, Carter again made headlines when it was alleged that he went to the house of former teammate Blake Ferguson. According to authorities, Carter and Ferguson were drinking until 3AM when Ferguson asked Carter to leave the house as he had young children asleep inside. It is then alleged that after Carter left Ferguson's property he made a phone call to the authorities saying that Ferguson had given his two young children drugs. The Police then knocked on Ferguson's door around 5:15AM to respond for a call to welfare of the two young children. After emergency services checked the children they found no wrongdoing from Ferguson nor any drugs in the house.\nOn 29 November 2017, Carter failed to appear in court for sentencing relating to supply of cocaine. Carter was due to be sentenced for supplying a small quantity of cocaine to ex-teammate Shaun Kenny-Dowall at The Ivy nightclub in May 2017. It was revealed that Carter was overseas in a rehabilitation center. The magistrate said in relation to Carter failing to appear at court as being \"Unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable\". The magistrate ordered that sentencing be moved to 10 January 2018.\nOn 13 December 2017, it was reported that Carter was involved in a fake jersey scam where he allegedly sold fake merchandise to a fan over eBay. Carter then admitted to the buyer that the jerseys were fake and he needed the money because he was struggling financially. The fan claimed that he sent Carter $2000 as he felt the troubled player needed help and that Carter would pay him back once he joined The Sydney Roosters. Carter was later sacked by The Roosters and the money was never paid back to the buyer.\nOn 10 January 2018, Carter was handed a two-year good behaviour bond by the court and escaped a jail sentence.\nOn 15 January 2019, it was revealed that Carter was accused of being at the center of a video leaking scandal regarding former teammate Dylan Napa. Carter had vehemently denied he was leaking the Dylan Napa sex tapes as part of a campaign to extort money from his former teammate. A senior staff member at the Sydney Roosters claimed that Carter was a past member of a WhatsApp player group and had access to \"all the videos\". It was claimed that Carter fell out with Napa 18 months ago and he wanted money in exchange for keeping the videos private.\nCarter responded to the claims saying \"I heard the allegations from people close to me, who messaged me in disbelief asking, 'What’s going on here?’ I was in shock. \"When I was at the Roosters, I had a great relationship with Dylan and still do to this day. He sent me a message confirming the exact same thing: that we have a good relationship and there’s no bad blood. I left the Roosters but there’s no bad blood with the club or any of the players, I haven’t read the message and probably won’t. I’ve got bigger and better things to worry about than people playing games and making up stories. It’s sad that they don’t have anything better to do with their lives\".\nIn December 2023, it was reported that Carter had avoided jail time after being found guilty of spitting in his ex-girlfriend's face on three occasions and also physically assaulting her."

        "text": "The Baltimore City College boys' basketball team, known as the \"Black Knights\", or formerly, the \"Castlemen\", and \"Alamedans\", is the high school basketball team of Baltimore City College, popularly referred to as \"City College\", or simply \"City\". The school's athletic teams were primarily referred to as the \"Collegians\" prior to 1953, a moniker that is still used alternatively today. One of the earliest results recorded in program history is a one-point overtime road loss to the University of Maryland Terrapins on January 25, 1913. With a recorded history spanning more than 110 years, the program is one of the oldest high school basketball teams in the United States. From 1919 to 1992, the team competed as members of the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA). During this period the team won thirteen MSA conference championships (1922, 1923, 1934, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1961, 1963, 1966, 1967, 1969, and 1970). \nThe Black Knights have won four Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) state championships (2009, 2010, 2014, and 2023), fifth-most among all MPSSAA schools since the school joined the league in 1993. City College is joined by Allegany and Lake Clifton as the only schools in history to at least one MPSSAA state championships per decade for four or more straight decades. The team has won nine MPSSAA regional championships in school history (1997, 1998, 1999, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2022, and 2023), advancing to state semifinals (Final Four). The program has also won two Baltimore City championships (2014 and 2023). \nHistory.\nMaryland Scholastic Association (MSA) era (1919-1992).\nCity College began competing in the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) in 1919 as a founding member. The team captured 12 MSA conference championships in school history (1922, 1923, 1934, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1961, 1963, 1966, 1967, 1969). \nBetween 1960 and 1968, George Howard “Jerry” Phipps led the school through one of the most successful eras in program history. As head coach, Phipps earned a record of 133-27 (.831), five MSA championships (1961, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967), and a 40-game consecutive win streak between 1966 and 1967. The 1967 team posted an undefeated season, the second of back-to-back perfect seasons, and was led to the MSA championship by team captain Leonard Hamm, who later became commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department. \nEugene Parker became the first Black faculty member in school history in 1954. Parker replaced Phipps as head coach in 1969, and guided the team to the MSA conference championship in his first season at the helm. He also won a MSA co-championship in 1970. After 73 years of membership, the school withdrew from the MSA to join the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) in 1993.\nMPSSAA era (1993-present).\nCity has won four Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) state championships in school history (2009, 2010, 2014, 2023) and is one of just five schools in Maryland to win three or more boys basketball state titles since 2000.\nThe Black Knights have advanced to the MPSSAA state tournament semifinals eight times (1997, 1998, 1999, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2022, 2023), third most all-time among Baltimore City League teams.\nWayne Cook took over as head boys basketball coach in 1989 and led City College to the school's final MSA victory in 1993. Following a 10-10 finish in 1993-94, Daryl Wade replaced Cook as head boys basketball coach prior to the 1994-95 season. In 1997, Coach Wade led City to its first-ever MPSSAA state semifinal appearance. Wade led City to two more trips to the state semifinals in 1998 and 1999 before leaving the program in 2000.\nIn 2005, longtime Towson Catholic coach Mike Daniel was named head boys' basketball coach.

        "text": "The International Premier Tennis League (IPTL, officially the Coca-Cola International Premier Tennis League Presented by Qatar Airways pursuant to sponsorship agreements with The Coca-Cola Company and Qatar Airways) was an annual team tennis league that took place in various cities in Asia. Founded in 2013, the elite level exhibition tennis tournament took place for the first time in November 2014. Due to financial issues the tournament was not held in 2017.\nHistory.\nMahesh Bhupathi announced the founding of the International Premier Tennis League on 25 May 2013, in Paris. The initial plan was to start the league with six charter franchises in Asia with the inaugural season commencing in November 2014. Bhupathi said the league would be modeled after the Indian Premier League, a cricket league in India. Justin Gimelstob said that the league would be star-driven as World Team Tennis was in the 1970s.\nOn 21 January 2014, IPTL announced the locations of the six charter franchises for the league's inaugural season. Five franchises would play their home matches in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai and Singapore. A sixth franchise would play its home matches in an undisclosed city in the Middle East. There was confusion surrounding the announcement. Some media outlets reported that there would be five franchises, not six as had been previously announced, and did not include the Hong Kong franchise among the five. Later news reports in February 2014, indicated that there would be five franchises including one based in Hong Kong but not one in the Middle East.\nIPTL conducted its inaugural player draft on 2 March 2014. Right up until the day before the draft, the media remained under the impression that the Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur franchises would participate in the league and that the Middle East franchise was doubtful. However, only four teams participated in the draft: Bangkok, Mumbai, Singapore and Middle East now referred to as the Dubai franchise. No mention was made by IPTL of the Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur franchises which had abruptly disappeared.\nBy May 2014, the Dubai franchise was being referred to as the UAE Falcons, the Mumbai franchise had been named the Indian Aces, and the Singapore franchise was being referred to as the Singapore Lions.\nOn 10 May 2014, IPTL announced that the Bangkok franchise would be moved to Manila, Philippines due to political unrest in Thailand.\nOn 19 June 2014, an IPTL press release revealed the owners of the four franchises to the general public. The owner of the Indian franchise, Micromax Informatics Ltd. proved to be the reason the team was no longer called the Mumbai franchise, because it preferred to have the team play its home matches in New Delhi. A group called PVP Ventures led by entrepreneur Prasad V Potluri and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar had been the original franchise owners with a plan to play home matches in Mumbai. While league managing director Bhupathi said PVP Ventures had been replaced by Micromax, because PVP missed a payment deadline, PVP said it had withdrawn from the league due to lack of clarity over how IPTL's business model was progressing and disagreements over player contracts. PVP did not want the team to be solely responsible for payment of player salaries and favored the league being obligated as well.\nBy June 2014, the Manila franchise had been named the Manila Mavericks, the Falcons had become the UAE Royals and the Lions had become the Singapore Slammers.\nThe IPTL was not held in 2017 after 3 seasons of the tennis league due to financial issues. The number of legs was reduced to three from the previous five for the 2016 season and the league was not able to secure players, Roger Federer and Serena Williams. It was planned that the following season of the IPTL would be hosted in a single country.\nIn 2018, Broadcast Sports News accused founder Mahesh Bhupathi of non-payment of dues to the IPTL's stakeholders. Bhupathi confirmed the non-payment but added that the Legendari group which is behind the Japan Warriors team which joined the IPTL in 2016 was largely responsible for the leagues' financial crisis alleging the group of committing fraud.\nCompetition format.\nAll IPTL matches conform to the rules of tennis and code of conduct laid down by the International Tennis Federation. A match comprises five sets each of a different category as follows:\nThe order of play is decided by the coach of the home team. If two teams are playing at a neutral site, then a coin toss determines which coach chooses the order of play. The first serve in the first set is determined by a coin toss. The team that served last in the last game or tiebreaker of the previous set will receive during the next set.\nEach team can call a power point once in each set when receiving serve, and the next point played will count double. Effectively, a player trailing 15–0 can directly get to 15–30 by winning the power point.\nGames are played to four points using no-ad scoring. Each game won by a player or doubles team adds one point to the team's score in the match. The team with the most points at the end of the five sets wins the match. Each set is won when a team is the first to reach six games won. If the score is five-games-all, a timed five-minute shoot-out will be played. The player or doubles team leading at the end of five minutes wins the set.\nIf the team that wins the fifth set is leading the match, the match is over. If the score is tied after one team has won the fifth set, a timed seven-minute men's singles super shoot-out is played. The result counts as a game point won. If the team that wins the fifth set is trailing in the match, the match will go to sudden-death overtime effectively extending the fifth set. If the leading team wins one game in overtime, it wins the match tie. If the trailing team wins enough games in overtime to tie the match score without losing a game, a timed seven-minute men's singles super shoot-out is played to decide the winner of the match tie. A coin toss decides who serves first in super shoot-outs.\nDuring IPTL matches, a shot clock keeps track of the countdown between points and during the change overs. There will be a maximum of 20 seconds between each game point and a maximum of three minutes between each set.\nEach team can call for a coach's time out once during each set. Each time out is limited to a maximum duration of 60 seconds.\nEach team can make one player substitution per set except a team with the overall match lead in the final set. If a player on a team with the overall match lead gets injured during the fifth set, he or she cannot be replaced. The team trailing in the match is credited with enough games won to tie the overall match score and send it to a super shoot-out. Players removed from a set for a substitute may play in later sets in the match.\nThe team that wins a match tie has four points added to its total in the team standings. If the losing team accumulates at least 20 game points, it receives two points in the team standings. If the losing team accumulates at least 10 but less than 20 game points, it receives one point in the team standings. Losing teams that earn less than 10 game points do not receive any points in the team standings.\nThe team with the most points throughout the season is declared the IPTL champion. In the event that two or more teams share the highest points on the final tally, the criteria to decide the champion are \nThe IPTL champions will receive the IPTL Challenge Trophy along with a grand prize of US$1,000,000.\nSeasons.\n2014 season.\nIPTL started its inaugural season on 28 November 2014, with the Indian Aces defeating the Singapore Slammers, 26–16, in Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines. Rohan Bopanna served the first point of the league's inaugural match.\nOn 30 November, the Aces defeated the UAE Royals in Pasay, 28–20, in a matchup of two previously unbeaten teams to move into first place in the standings at the end of the league's Philippines wing.\nThe Indian Aces were declared the champions of the inaugural season on the final day with overall 2 points lead over the runners-up UAE Royals.\n2016 season.\nFor the 2016 season, only 4 teams from the previous 5 participated. The UAE Royals, one of the participating teams, did not play any games in their country.\nTelevision coverage.\nOn 22 August 2014, IPTL announced it had reached an agreement for the Middle East and North Africa television broadcasting rights with Abu Dhabi Media.

        "text": "Leslie D. \"Les\" Norman (December 2, 1939 in Sexsmith, Alberta – December 2010) was a Canadian professional and amateur box lacrosse goaltender. A long-time member of the New Westminster Salmonbellies franchise, Norman was a winner of three Mann Cups as a Canadian Lacrosse Champion, the 1968 National Lacrosse Association professional championship, and the 1965 Mann Cup's most valuable player. Norman was also the first goaltender to post a shutout in a Western Lacrosse Association (then ICLL) game. Les Norman was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1989.\nCareer.\nIn 1958, Norman played for both the Senior and Junior teams in New Westminster. In the 1959 season, he was chosen to replace legend Bunny Joseph. By the end of the season, Norman was named a First Team All-Star and Rookie of the Year of the ICLL. He capped off the season by leading the O'Keefes to a 4-games-to-none Mann Cup victory over the Peterborough Mercurys. The Mercurys's legendary goaltender Moon Wootton proclaimed after the series, \"That guy Norman is some goalie. He'll be getting the name I've had for some years.\"\nIn 1962, Norman, now a veteran of the team, helped the O'Keefes to a second ICLL championship and another 4-games-to-none sweep in a Mann Cup final, this time against the Brampton Ramblers. On May 3, 1962, he led the O'Keefes to a 27-save shutout over the Victoria Shamrocks, the first shutout in ICLL/WLA history.\nIn 1965, Norman would lead the O'Keefes to a third league title. Norman would claim his third and final Mann Cup in seven games over the Brooklin Merchants and win the Mike Kelly Memorial Trophy as the Mann Cup's most valuable player.\nIn 1968, Norman went professional when his Salmonbellies joined the Western Division of the National Lacrosse Association. Despite being passed over for all major awards and all-star teams and a third-place finish in the West, Norman would lead the Salmonbellies to a seven-game victory over the Vancouver Carlings and a six-game victory to knock off the first-place and Joe Comeau-less Portland Adanacs to win the West. The Salmonbellies would meet Gaylord Powless the Detroit Olympias in the NLA final and beat them four games to two.\nAfter playing nine games in a second NLA season, Norman left lacrosse. He would return for the 1971 season and then retire. He was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1989. He died in December 2010 after a short battle with brain cancer.\nStatistics.\n\"Source: Wamper's Bible of Lacrosse and Stan Shillington's \"Who's Who in Lacrosse 1933–2013: Goaltending Records\"."

He is formerly the head coach of the Rochester Americans and Syracuse Crunch of the AHL, along with being the former head coach and general manager for the Gatineau Olympiques of the QMJHL.\nPlaying career.\nGroulx played major junior hockey with the Granby Bisons of the QMJHL.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2000, following an 11-year professional career played mostly in France, Groulx turned to coaching, taking an assistant position with the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL. He became a head coach during the 2000–01 QMJHL season when he replaced John Chabot to take the reins of the Hull Olympiques, which was changed to the Gatineau Olympiques in 2003 following the city's amalgamation in 2002, where he won the 2003–04 Ron Lapointe Trophy as the QMJHL coach of the year. He was a head coach in the American Hockey League with the Rochester Americans for both the 2008–09 and 2009–10 AHL seasons, but re-join the Gatineau Olympiques in 2010.\nAfter serving as assistant coach under Brent Sutter at the 2014 World Junior Championships, he was named head coach for Team Canada for the 2015 World Junior Championships.\nGroulx was named head coach of the Syracuse Crunch on May 10, 2016, replacing Rob Zettler. In his first season as head coach, he led the Crunch to the Calder Cup Finals and an Eastern Conference title. His second season as head coach of the Crunch was also success. His Crunch had a 10-game winning streak and a 7-game win streak at certain points, in which the 10-game win streak lasted from November 22, 2017 to December 15, 2017. The 7-game win streak lasted from March 14, 2018 to March 30, 2018. He also led the Crunch to their highest win percentage in franchise history, a .658 win percentage. The Crunch easily did away with Rochester in the first round sweeping the Americans, 3–0. However, the Crunch were swept by the eventual Calder Cup Champions, the Toronto Marlies, 4–0, in the second round. In the following season, the Crunch had their best regular season in their history, but were upset in round 1 by the Cleveland Monsters.\nGroulx achieved 200 professional coaching wins on March 30, 2019 while coaching the Syracuse Crunch. The Crunch beat the Utica Comets 6–2.\nGroulx is the winningest coach in Syracuse Crunch history, with 221 career coaching wins with the Crunch. \nDuring the 2021 Syracuse Crunch training camp, Groulx fractured his left elbow after falling down at practice.\nIn 2021, Groulx interviewed for the head coach position of the Arizona Coyotes, after a vacancy was left by Rick Tocchet. He would not get the job, as Arizona hired André Tourigny.\nOn February 21, 2022, Groulx won his 200th career game with the Crunch.\nPersonal life.\nGroulx's son, Benoit-Olivier, also known as \"Bo\" was selected 54th overall by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft."

        "title": "WASP (cricket calculation tool)",
        "text": "Winning and Score Predictor (WASP) is a calculation tool used in cricket to predict scores and possible results of a limited overs match, e.g. One Day and Twenty 20 matches.\nThe prediction is based upon factors like the ease of scoring on the day according to the pitch, weather and boundary size. For the team batting first, it gives the prediction of the final total. For the team batting second, it gives the probability of the chasing team winning, although it does not just take the match situation into equation. Predictions are based on the average team playing against the average team in those conditions.\nThe models are based on a database of all non-shortened One Day International (ODI) matches and Twenty20 games played between top-eight countries since late 2006 (slightly further back for Twenty20 games). The batting-first model estimates the additional runs likely to be scored as a function of the number of balls and wickets remaining. The batting-second model estimates the probability of winning as a function of balls and wickets remaining, runs scored to date, and the target score. Projected score or required run-rate will not qualitatively show the real picture as they fail to take into the account the quality of the batting team and the quality of the bowling attack. WASP is a very good quantitative parameter.\nHistory.\nThe WASP technique is a product of some extensive research from PhD graduate Dr Scott Brooker and his supervisor Dr Seamus Hogan at the University of Canterbury (UC) in Christchurch, New Zealand. They worked on this project for four years and started after they received a phone call from the university's economics department asking them to investigate alternatives to the Duckworth–Lewis method.\nWASP was first introduced to the public by Sky Sport New Zealand in November 2012 during Auckland's HRV Cup Twenty20 game against Wellington.\nSInce 2018, the underlying WASP system has been owned by NV Play, a global cricket technology company based in New Zealand. NV Play have subsequently extended the WASP tool (in partnership with Dr Scott Brooker, one of the original WASP creators) to include the concept of pressure, and have developed a range of enhanced player contribution metrics to support high performance programmes.\nWASP is now deeply embedded in NV Play Cricket, NV's flagship cricket technology platform, and is available to all high end recreational &amp; professional cricketers.\nTheory.\nThe WASP system is grounded in the theory of dynamic programming. It looks at data from past matches and estimates the probability of runs and wickets in each game situation, and works backwards to calculate the total runs or probability of winning in any situation.\nThis is how Dr Seamus Hogan – one of the creators of WASP – described the system:\nLet \"V\"(\"b\",\"w\") be the expected additional runs for the rest of the innings when \"b\" (legitimate) balls have been bowled and \"w\" wickets have been lost, and let \"r\"(\"b\",\"w\") and \"p\"(\"b\",\"w\") be, respectively, the estimated expected runs and the probability of a wicket on the next ball in that situation.\nWe can then write,\nSince \"V\"(\"b*\",\"w\")=0 where \"b\"* equals the maximum number of legitimate deliveries allowed in the innings (300 in a 50 over game), we can solve the model backwards.\nThis means that the estimates for \"V\"(\"b\",\"w\") in rare situations depends only slightly on the estimated runs and probability of a wicket on that ball, and mostly on the values of \"V\"(\"b\" + 1,\"w\") and \"V\"(\"b\" + 1,\"w\" + 1), which will be mostly determined by thick data points.\nThe batting second model is a bit more complicated, but uses essentially the same logic.\nDrawbacks.\nIf a batsman gets retired hurt, the model will not work well as it does not know the position in which the retired hurt batsman will come to bat again. This happened in a match between England and New Zealand, as injured Martin Guptill came to the crease again in the ninth position and gave a staggering performance which is unusual for a ninth position batsman and helped his team to win the match."

        "text": "Nedlands Rugby Union Football Club, often referred to as Neddies, is a rugby union club based in Nedlands, Western Australia, with several teams competing in the local RugbyWA competitions including the RugbyWA Fortescue Premier Grade.\nThe club trains and plays its home games at Charles Court Reserve located on the banks of the Swan River in Nedlands. The club has a large function centre and licensed bar facility which overlooks the rugby grounds.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1934, Nedlands RUFC represents an area not much older than the club itself. In 1931, the Claremont Roads Board split and formed the Nedlands Road Board, later becoming Nedlands Municipal Council and then City of Nedlands. Land in the area had initially been settled in the 1850s by Captain John Bruce, and he bequeathed the land to his son Edward – hence the area became known as Ned’s Land, later morphing into Nedlands. The club’s emblem – the rampant lion, is thought to have derived from the badge of the Bruce family.\nNedlands RUFC was formed at a meeting in Alec E Davies’ tearooms on the corner of Broadway and The Esplanade called by Cliff Stark, at 7:45 pm on 5 April 1934. In that first season, the club fielded just one team with players wearing a black jumper with a large gold N on the chest. The jumper was changed to blue and gold in 1962 to conform with the colours of the original Claremont Road Board.\nThe club initially played on a ground made up from four vacant blocks on Aberdare Rd. After nearly 20 years of temporary fields, Neddies was finally granted a permanent home on the Nedlands Foreshore in 1951, after using it unofficially since 1946. The Foreshore had been reclaimed from the Swan River before and after World War 1, and in the 1930s was a highly popular camping and holiday ground. But as West Australians became more mobile after WW2, the demand for its use fell away and it became a sports ground. Initially, the park was shared between the Nedlands and Associates clubs, but Associates moved to a ground of their own in the 1980s.\nSuccess came early for Nedlands. After finding its feet in the 1934 season, the Club won the 1935 B Grade grand-final, a wonderful achievement. This success caused an upshot in player numbers with membership rising from 24 in 1935 to 55 in 1936. Now with teams in both the B and C grade, the club pushed for promotion to A grade. This was finally granted in 1939, and the following year, Nedlands proved that they were now a force in WA rugby by winning the 1940 A Grade grand final. This team included some of the great names in our Club history with Cliff Stark, Bob McMillan, Laurie Simmonds. John Poor and Joe Poynton all featuring in the club’s records in the years to come. It’s interesting to note that captain Laurie Simmonds’ son Ken featured in the club’s third A Grade premiership team thirty years later in 1970. Today, 80 years after their great grandfather led Neddies, another generation of Simmonds are turning out for the juniors, proudly wearing the blue and gold.\nWorld War 2 and its aftermath brought hard times to Nedlands, compounded by a breakaway group who went to rugby league in the early 1950s. While some of these players returned to the fold, and the Club won a famous A Grade premiership in 1957, this was a difficult period for Nedlands. For a time, we were only kept alive by the determination and great work of men like Joe Poynton, Jim Stitfall and Jim Macauley. Charlie Duncan and his wife Jess were also key in holding the club together, with Jess serving as both Club Secretary and Colts coach for a number of years.\n1960-1999.\nThe club’s fortunes began to change in 1963, with the arrival of Peter Bailey. Bailey, known as the father of the modern Nedlands club came to Perth for the Commonwealth Games in 1962 and fell in love with the city and with Nedlands. He introduced a “kiwi connection” to the club and in the ensuing years served in a wide range of roles from player to coach to President, in the process building the foundations of the powerhouse that Nedlands has become. Many of the people who were to contribute to and lead the Club in the next 40 years were nurtured by Bailey, including Steve Takiari, Terry Bradbury, Peter Shaw, Dave Walsh and Chris Lowson, together with great clubmen Rex Julian and Garry Ash who started the Thursday night dinners from the then tiny kitchen. Players such as Englishmen Dave Brock and Dave Rosewall, and Kiwi imports John Walker, Tim Lowson, Bradbury, Rob McKenzie, Peter Rowan, Graeme Holmes, Phil Hobbs and many others made huge on-field contributions to Nedlands through this period.\nThe 80s and 90s, along with the holding of the Americas Cup yacht races in Perth saw another influx of strong players to Nedlands, and our supporters grew used to seeing top quality players such as All Black Paul Koteka, representative level players Peter Chadwick, Peter Roberts, Gavin Bermingham, Reg Walters, Nudge Edwards, Mike Ryburn, Glen Thompson, John O’Callaghan and Tom Fearn wearing the royal blue and gold. With excellent coaches like Viv Booker, Wayne Hill, Dave McKnight and Fearn guiding them, these men were successful in what was arguably the best quality A Grade competition ever known in Perth – in today’s world they would be highly paid professionals plying their trade in Europe. When the WA State team went on tour, there were so many members from Nedlands that paying their tour levy to WARU placed severe financial strain on the club. The club’s honours boards attest to the huge number of Nedlands players who have represented their state, and even their country. During the 90s a powerful Neddies Women’s team swept all before it, and the club, in particular great stalwarts Sue Roberts and Freda Black, is keen to resurrect that team. The key administrator to emerge from these times was long standing patron Richard Vaughan who has contributed to the Club in a myriad of ways. \nIn the last 30 plus years, Nedlands has seen a shift of emphasis from relying on imported players to developing home grown ones. Over the years the Junior Club has gone from strength to strength and we have poured resources into developing skilled and successful colts teams which have brought home numerous premierships. Many members of these colts teams have gone on to play hundreds of games for the club, with the leader in this regard being great rugby man George Forster-Jones who turned out in the blue and gold an incredible 500 times – and then went on to a successful refereeing career! Other “ex-colts” to feature in over 200 games for Neddies include Michael Botes, Matt Caporn, Damian Pacecca, Tim Badham, Mike Weir and Matt Suter, with ‘youngsters’ Jamie Hawgood, David Bailey and Kauri Cudd all heading towards that mark.\n21st Century.\nThe 21st Century has seen another group of people represent and contribute to Nedlands. Tony and Rod Ball – sons of Life Member Kevin and themselves Life Members, and Terry Bradbury’s son Steve have been key members, along with Wendy Hickman Lisa Vaughan, Craig Holdcroft and outstanding leaders Murray McLean, Hans Sauer and Peter Malcolm. In 2009 the club celebrated its 75th Anniversary and this was marked by the publication of a magnificent book “Neddies – The First Seventy Five Years” written by Life Member Mark Drummond and including an earlier version “The Golden Lion” by Bob Messenger which had been written to celebrate Nedlands’ 50th Anniversary. In 2013 the club changed its administration model from the traditional committee to a Board of Management, while past president and long-term sponsor Rick Wolozny guided the formation of a Board of Trustees to oversee the club’s finances and ensure that financial resources are put away for future projects. On the field Nathan Roberts has played more than 200 games for Neddies, while Richie Naylor, Brad Wilkinson, Joe (Peanut) Ritchie, Alvin (Stardust) Lau, Trefor Thomas, Chris Naylor and Dylan Loversidge have all made massive contributions. In 2017, the club was proud to have three members of our 1st grade team – Michael Ruru, Anaru Rangi and Jermaine Ainsley offered contracts with the Western Force. After the demise of the Force, all three players have gone on to successful professional careers around the world.\nNedlands members haven’t just contributed to their club however. Many Neddies administrators, including Sauer, Takiari, Lowson and Josh Aislabie have gone on to serve on the board of Rugby WA and in other capacities, with Bradbury and Bailey being awarded Life Membership of that organisation for their great service.\nCoaches.\nNedlands' head coach for 2023 in Premier Grade is Sam Rarasea, a former Nedlands Premier Grade player. Assisting him is Tony Ball as reserve grade head coach.\nNotable members.\nNedlands players to have gained international caps include:"

Johansson was selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the third round, 61st overall, at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. Along with Buffalo, Johansson has previously played with the Colorado Avalanche and Florida Panthers in the National Hockey League (NHL) and Brynäs IF of the SHL.\nPlaying career.\nJohansson won a silver medal with Team Sweden at the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in a backup role, and he made his Swedish Hockey League debut playing with Brynäs IF during the 2013–14 SHL season.\nOn 31 May 2017, Johansson agreed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Buffalo Sabres.\nJohansson made his NHL debut on 4 February 2020, in relief of Carter Hutton in a game against the Colorado Avalanche. His first NHL start came on 6 February, making 18 saves on 21 shots in a shootout loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Johansson recorded his first NHL win on 23 February 2020, 2–1 against the Winnipeg Jets.\nWith the following North American season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 31 October 2020, Johansson was loaned by the Sabres to German club, Krefeld Pinguine of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), until the commencement of NHL training camp. Before joining Krefeld, the DEL was later delayed due to the pandemic and Johansson returned to the Sabres.\nOn 20 March 2021, Johansson was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick. The trade was delayed by a day as the Sabres waited to receive the results of several COVID-19 tests. Following the trade, Sabres beat writer John Vogl called Johansson the worst goaltender he had seen in nineteen years of covering the team. With the Avalanche, Johansson finished the regular season with a 5–1–1 record, including a win in their season finale against the Los Angeles Kings. He remained with the Avalanche through the playoffs without making an appearance, serving games as the backup while later among the black aces as the club's third choice goaltender.\nOn 29 June 2021, Johansson as a pending free agent opted to continue within the Avalanche organization, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract extension. On 13 December, Johansson was claimed off waivers by the Florida Panthers.\nAs a free agent from the Panthers, Johansson opted to return to former club, the Colorado Avalanche, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract on 13 July 2022. After attending training camp with the Avalanche, Johansson was placed on waivers during the pre-season. He was claimed the following day by divisional rival in the Arizona Coyotes on 30 September 2022. Johansson made one pre-season appearance with the Coyotes before he was injured and placed on the injured-reserve prior to being placed back on waivers on 11 October 2022. Johansson was re-claimed the following day off waivers by the Avalanche and re-assigned to join the Colorado Eagles to begin the 2022–23 season. In sharing starting goaltender duties with prospect Justus Annunen, Johansson made the most appearances in a season since 2018, collecting 14 wins through 26 regular season games. He was recalled by the Avalanche on numerous occasions to serve as the club's backup through injury and made 3 further NHL appearances, posting 2 wins. \nAt the completion of the season with the Avalanche and as a pending free agent, Johansson initially opted to return to Sweden in signing a two-year contract with Färjestad BK of the SHL on 9 May 2023. However, in little under a month later on 7 June 2023, his contract with Färjestad BK was mutually cancelled with Johansson harbouring intentions to continue his career in North America.\nOn the opening day of free agency, on 1 July 2023, Johansson was signed by the Tampa Bay Lightning to a two-year, $1.55 million contract."

        "text": "Malcolm Hill (born October 26, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Birmingham Squadron of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the Illinois Fighting Illini.\nHigh school career.\nFollowing his junior season in which he averaged 23.8 points and shot 44% from three-point range, Hill verbally committed to Illinois and former head coach Bruce Weber on September 12, 2011. Prior to verbally committing, Hill listed Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio State, Providence, UCLA, Xavier, and Wisconsin as the other schools he had considered.\nDuring his senior season, Hill broke his previous single season scoring mark he set during his junior season increasing his scoring total from 666 points to 708 total points. He averaged 25.3 points, 6.1 rebounds 2.3 steals and 1.9 blocks during his final year at Belleville, and also finished in third place for Mr. Illinois Basketball voting, finishing behind Simeon's Jabari Parker and Whitney Young's Jahlil Okafor.\nAfter head coach John Groce was hired on March 29, 2012, Hill reaffirmed his verbal commitment to Illinois, and officially signed his National Letter of Intent on November 14, 2012.\nCollege career.\nHill made his first start, along with fellow freshman Kendrick Nunn, for the Fighting Illini on February 9, 2014, against Penn State, scoring 11 points and helping the team end an 8-game losing streak.\nOn January 7, 2015, Hill scored a career-high 28 points as a sophomore to lead the Fighting Illini to a win at home against 11th-ranked Maryland when Illinois' leading scorer Rayvonte Rice was sidelined with a broken hand.\nAs a junior, Hill was named one of ten finalists for the 2016 Jerry West Award which is awarded by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the best collegiate shooting guard in the United States. In a double-overtime loss to Penn State at the end of the 2015–16 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, Hill set another career high scoring 39 points. Hill's 39 points were the most since Brandon Paul scored 43 points against Ohio State in 2012 and the seventh most points scored by an Illini player in program history. Following his junior season, Hill became the only Illinois basketball player to record 600 points, 200 rebounds and 100 assists in a single season. On November 13, 2016, Hill bested that career mark with 40 points in a 79–64 victory over Northern Kentucky. Following his senior season, Hill was invited to participate in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, which is held annually in Portsmouth, Virginia to showcase college basketball's best seniors.\nProfessional career.\nStar Hotshots (2017).\nAfter going undrafted in the 2017 NBA draft, Hill joined the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2017 NBA Summer League and in July, he signed with the Star Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association as their import for the 2017 PBA Governors' Cup, where he averaged 26 points, 11.7 rebounds and 3 assists.\nTelekom Baskets Bonn (2017–2018).\nIn September 2017, Hill signed with Telekom Baskets Bonn of the German Basketball Bundesliga.\nMHP Riesen Ludwigsburg (2018–2019).\nAfter his first season in Germany, Hill joined the Utah Jazz for the 2018 NBA Summer League and in October, 2018, he signed with MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg for the 2018–19 Basketball Bundesliga season.\nBC Astana (2019–2020).\nOn August 16, 2019, Hill signed with BC Astana of the Kazakhstan Championship, where he averaged 20.2 points, 4 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.\nHill joined House of 'Paign, a team composed primarily of Illinois alumni in The Basketball Tournament 2020. He scored 14 points and had four rebounds in a 76–53 win over War Tampa in the first round.\nHapoel Jerusalem (2020–2021).\nOn August 17, 2020, Hill signed with Hapoel Jerusalem of the Israeli Basketball Premier League and the Basketball Champions League.\nBirmingham Squadron (2021).\nOn October 9, 2021, Hill signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. However, he was waived on October 12. On October 25, he signed with the Birmingham Squadron as an affiliate player. In 14 games, he averaged 16.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.6 steals in 31.6 minutes per game.\nAtlanta Hawks (2021–2022).\nOn December 22, 2021, Hill signed a 10-day contract with the Atlanta Hawks. In his 3 appearances, he averaged 5.7 points, 2 rebounds and 0.3 assist in 15.3 minutes per game.\nChicago Bulls (2022–2023).\nOn January 14, 2022, Hill signed a 10-day contract with the Chicago Bulls. On January 19, he signed a two-way contract with the team.\nOn September 7, 2022, Hill re-signed with the Bulls on a new two-way contract. On February 21, 2023, he was waived by the Bulls.\nNew Orleans Pelicans / Return to Birmingham (2023–present).\nOn February 24, 2023, Hill was re-acquired by the Birmingham Squadron. On September 30, he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, but was waived on October 22. Eight days later, he re-signed with Birmingham.\nOn January 27, 2024, Hill signed a 10-day contract with the New Orleans Pelicans, but didn't play for them and on February 8, he returned to Birmingham. On February 22, he signed a two-way contract with the Pelicans.\nInternational career.\nIn June 2015, Hill was among the 22 players who earned an invitation to the training camp for the 2015 U.S. Pan American Men's Basketball team at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Competition took place July 21–25 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. However, Hill was not selected for the final roster.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Hill moved with his family to a nearby Metro East suburb Belleville, Illinois when he was four years old. Up until fifth grade, Hill also played soccer and baseball, but chose to focus on basketball. Hill's father, Malcolm, played NCAA Division II basketball for UMSL Tritons during the early 1990s.\nDuring the summer of 2012, Hill was diagnosed with Thoracic outlet syndrome, and underwent surgery to repair the blood clot in his upper right arm. Hill took several months to recover from the operation and made a full recovery."

        "title": "Comparison of association football and rugby union",
        "text": "Comparison of association football (football/soccer) and rugby union (rugby/rugby football/rugger) is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins.\nRugby union has a number of set pieces, such as line-outs, scrums and rucks that do not have direct equivalents in association football. Association football aims at a more open kind of play, and there is not the same differentiation between forwards and backs. Another major difference is that rugby union, unlike association football, has no goal keeper.\nHistory of early football.\nThe earliest forms of football comprise the common ancestry of both association football and of rugby union. Two of the earliest recorded football type games from Europe include Episkyros from Ancient Greece and the Roman version Harpastum, which similar to pre-codified \"Mob Football\" involved more handling the ball than kicking it. Other competitive games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in a few countries throughout history, such as cuju in China.\nThe rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name \"association football\" was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The term \"soccer\" originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford \"-er\" abbreviation of the word \"association\".\nWithin the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called \"football\" in the United Kingdom, and mainly \"soccer\" in Canada and the United States. Other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, may use either or both terms.\nMost of the interplay between the two codes occurred in the nineteenth century, where the \"Associationists\" preferred a kicking game, and the \"Rugbeians\" preferred a handling/carrying game. The term \"soccer\" was formed by analogy to \"rugger\", a nickname for rugby football.\nOne of the early differences between the two codes, beyond playing style, was that of amateurism and professionalism. While rugby union football remained resolutely amateur until the 1990s (resulting in the split with rugby league), association football became professional very early on.\nPitch.\nAssociation football.\nThe \"penalty area\" is the large marked rectangular area. The smaller rectangle within it is the \"goal area\". The \"penalty arc\" is the curved line adjoining the \"top\" of the penalty area.\nWhile an association football pitch makes use of arcs and circles, all of the lines in rugby union are straight. Examples of such features include the \"centre circle\" is marked at from the \"centre spot\". Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at kick-off; the ball itself is placed on the \"centre spot\". During penalty shootouts all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle. The arcs in the \"corners\" denote the area (within 1-yard of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 10 yards away from the corner on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances.\nRugby union.\nThe field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of long by wide. In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area. There are several lines crossing it, notably the halfway line and the \"twenty two\", which is from the goal line.\nStricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least and the pitch must be at least wide.\nGoalposts.\nAnother key difference is the goal. Rugby union goalposts consist of two posts with a crossbar but without a net, whereas association football goalposts consist of two posts with a crossbar and a net. The area above the crossbar is used for scoring only in rugby union, whereas in association football, only the area below the crossbar is used for scoring.\nIn association football, the goal is wider and the crossbar marks its height, while the goalposts of rugby union are narrower and extend far above the crossbar.\nAssociation football.\nIn association football, the goal is the only method of scoring. It is also used to refer to the scoring structure. A deliberate attempt on goal is \nreferred to as a \"shot\". To score a goal, the ball must pass completely over the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar and no rules may be violated on the play (such as touching the ball with the hand or arm). See also offside. The goal structure is defined as a frame 24 feet (7.32 m) wide by 8 feet (2.44 m) tall. In most organised levels of play a net is attached behind the goal frame to catch the ball and indicate that a goal has been scored; but the Laws of the Game do not mandate the use of a net and only require that any net used not interfere with the goalkeeper.\nRugby union.\nIn rugby union, the try is seen as the main method of scoring, with additional means being to kick the goal between the two bars for a drop goal or a conversion after a try.\nA goal is scored in either rugby code by place kicking or drop kicking a ball over a crossbar and between goal posts. In rugby union, a goal scored from the field either as a drop kick during normal play or a place kick after a foul scores three points. In rugby league, a goal scored from the field as a drop kick scores one point, and a goal from a place kick after a foul scores two points. In both codes, a goal scored by place kick after a try (a \"conversion\") scores two points. The kick is taken from a position that is back in line from where the try was scored giving an incentive for teams to try and score near to the centre such that the kick is more attainable. Rugby league goal posts are generally H-shaped, 5.5 metres in width, with the cross bar three metres from the ground\nFootball as used in association football.\nLaw 2 of the game specifies that the ball is an air-filled sphere with a circumference of , a weight of , inflated to a pressure of 0.6 to 1.1 atmospheres () \"at sea level\", and covered in leather or \"other suitable material\". The weight specified for a ball is the dry weight, as older balls often became significantly heavier in the course of a match played in wet weather. The standard ball is a Size 5, although smaller sizes exist: Size 3 is standard for team handball and Size 4 in futsal and other small-field variants. Other sizes are used in underage games or as novelty items.\nMost modern footballs are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. The 32-panel configuration is the spherical polyhedron corresponding to the truncated icosahedron; it is spherical because the faces bulge from the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by Select in the 1950s in Denmark. This configuration became common throughout Continental Europe in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the Adidas Telstar, the official ball of the 1970 World Cup.\nThe familiar 32-panel football design is sometimes referenced to describe the truncated icosahedron Archimedean solid, carbon buckyballs or the root structure of geodesic domes.\nThere are a number of different types of football balls depending on the match and turf including: training footballs, match footballs, professional match footballs, beach footballs, street footballs, indoor footballs, turf balls, futsal footballs and mini/skills footballs.\nRugby union ball.\nRugby union uses an oval ball (a prolate spheroid). This makes a difference in the variety and style of kicking. Rugby union is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles.\nThe ball used in rugby union, usually referred to as a rugby ball, is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. A regulation football is long and in circumference at its widest point. It weighs and is inflated to .\nIn 1980, leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. The Gilbert Synergie was the match ball of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nDuration.\nA rugby union game is divided into two-halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an international match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead – any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or line-out, or when a team scores. This has led to some 'nail-biting' finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. The clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add stoppage time.\nAdvancing the ball and passing.\nIn both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly. In rugby union, this can be by hand (passing, or throw in) or by foot. In association football, this can only usually be done by foot (although the goalkeeper can handle the ball).\nThe term \"passing\" is used in association football to refer to a ball kicked to another player on the same team, whereas in rugby union it refers to when the ball is passed by hand to another player on the same team.\nBoth association football and rugby union have an offside rule. In rugby union, it is illegal to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction: a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be offside anyway. In association football, the ball can be passed backwards or forwards to a player on the same team, so long as the player passed to in front is onside.\nTackles and blocks.\nRugby union allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas association football explicitly disallows tackling of that sort. Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \"ram\" into the formation without first binding to the players.\nScoring.\nRugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.\nPlayers.\nThere is no \"goalkeeper\" in rugby union, instead there is a \"fullback\", although the fullback in rugby union is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does. A rugby union fullback generally fields the long range kicks, and makes long range attacks.\nRugby union allows a maximum of 15 players per side on the field at any one time; in the instance of association football, a maximum of 11 players per side is allowed on the field at any one time. These numbers may be reduced through players being sent off, or injuries without replacements. (The latter only tends to occur in the lower levels of each sport)\nInternational competition.\nBoth international association football and international rugby union share at least one thing in common. The original international games of each code were between Scotland and England in the early 1870s.\nRugby union has been an international game since 1871, when beat at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. entered international competition in 1875, and have played matches continuously ever since. The Rugby World Cup (RWC) itself is of much more recent origin, dating back to 1987, when invitations were sent out to various national sides. Entry has been through qualifying rounds ever since.\nThe first official international football match took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. The FIFA World Cup, often simply the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.\nVariants and casual play.\nVariants of association football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. Five-a-side football), for play in non-field environments (i.e. Beach soccer, Indoor soccer, and Futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. Paralympic association football).\nVariants of rugby union have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. rugby sevens, rugby tens), for youth training (i.e. mini rugby) for play in non-field environments (i.e. beach rugby and snow rugby) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. quad rugby).\nRugby league is a separate code from rugby union, but arose from the same game due to disputes over payment. Both rugby league and rugby union still share many elements in common, and may be confused by a casual spectator."

It was the first time since Pim von Huetschler in the 40th that non American sailors won the prestigious Worlds Title. It were Alexander Hagen and Vincent Hösch from Germany that rocked the Star Class in the early 80th with Laser like downwind technics and light body weight. They were struggling upwind because of minor crew weight. They managed to reach the 1st mark in 10th position but were \"flying\" on the reach to call for room at the jibing mark into 1st position. They were rocking the boat and pumping sails like sitting on a Laser to extend their lead. Then it was easy to defend the lead from the front despite their poor upwind speed. 2 Years later rocking and pumping was forbidden by the IYRU-Racing Rules. 16 Years later Alex Hagen won the Star Worlds again in Marblehead. This time Marcelo Ferreira (the crew of Torben Grael) was crewing."

Nevertheless, the Seychelles Cricket Association which oversees cricket in Seychelles is an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council and has been since 2010.\nHistory of cricket in the Seychelles.\nThe current Seychelles cricket team played its first ever match in August 2000, against a Rest of the World XI, winning comprehensively, and prompting hope that the sport would gain a greater foothold. The team toured India later that year, but were defeated by Maurindia Cricket Club. The game nevertheless grew, with the Seychelles featuring ten teams by June 2010, including women's and veteran's teams. Thus, they qualified for affiliate membership of the ICC, for which they applied that year. They also ran their inaugural domestic junior competition. They were awarded the membership in July, and in August announced the construction of their first international stadium. In February 2011 their team commenced a campaign to qualify for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20."

        "text": "Fred Trueman was an English cricketer, an \"aggressive\" fast bowler widely known as \"Fiery Fred\". He is generally acknowledged to have been one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history. He represented England in 67 Test matches, and was the first bowler to take 300 wickets in a Test career, taking twelve years and 65 Tests to reach the landmark.\nTrueman's wicket tally included seventeen five-wicket hauls (also known as \"five-fors\" or \"fifers\") which refer to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, only 41 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Trueman's seventeen five-wicket hauls places him joint-third in a list of most five-wicket hauls by England Test players, behind Ian Botham and Sydney Barnes. It includes three instances of him taking five or more wickets in each innings of the same Test match, and only one of the Tests in which he took a five-for ended in defeat for England.\nHis first five-for came in July 1952 against India in only his third Test match. It was also his career-best performance, eight wickets while conceding 31 runs, which remains the ninth most successful bowling figures by an England player. Five of his five-wicket hauls were taken against Australia, and six came against the West Indies. Four of the latter came during the 1963 West Indies tour of England, across which he took a career-best 34 wickets. He is joint-third in a tally of most five-fors taken against the West Indies in Test matches. He did not get the opportunity to play in One Day International cricket as it was not introduced until the 1970–1971 cricket season, several years after his retirement."

        "text": "Miguel Elias Rojas Naidernoff (born February 24, 1989) is a Venezuelan professional baseball shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Dodgers in 2014 and also played in MLB for the Miami Marlins from 2015 to 2022.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Reds.\nRojas was signed by the Cincinnati Reds organization as an amateur free agent in 2006 out of Venezuela and played for their affiliates in the Venezuelan Summer League and Dominican Summer League through 2007. In 2008, the Reds moved him to their domestic affiliate in the rookie-class Pioneer Baseball League, where he hit .183 in 61 games.\nRojas progressed through the Reds' farm system, playing for the Class-A Dayton Dragons in 2009, the Advanced-A Lynchburg Hillcats in 2010, the Double-A Carolina Mudcats in 2010 and 2011, and the Double-A Pensacola Blue Wahoos and the Triple-A Louisville Bats in 2012.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nAfter the 2012 season, Rojas became a free agent and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. He spent the 2013 season with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Double–A Southern League, where he hit .233 in 130 games. In 2014, he received a non-roster invite to Major League spring training, where he was given a chance to compete for the vacant second base job. The Dodgers assigned him to the Triple–A Albuquerque Isotopes to start 2014, where he hit .302 in 51 games.\nThe Dodgers promoted Rojas to the major leagues for the first time on June 6, 2014. He made his major league debut that day as a late-inning defensive replacement. His first hit was a single off Matt Belisle of the Colorado Rockies in his first start on June 8.\nRojas finished the 2014 regular season hitting only .181 with one home run and nine RBIs in 85 games. He frequently took over for Hanley Ramírez at shortstop late in games for defensive purposes. On June 18, he successfully made an extremely difficult defensive play to preserve a no hitter thrown by Clayton Kershaw in the 7th inning.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 10, 2014, the Dodgers traded Rojas, along with Dee Gordon and Dan Haren, to the Miami Marlins in exchange for Andrew Heaney, Chris Hatcher, Austin Barnes, and Enrique \"Kiké\" Hernández. In 2015, Rojas batted .282 with one home run and 17 RBI in 142 at-bats across 60 games. This earned Rojas more playing time the next season as he appeared in 123 games, slashing .247/.288/.325 with one home run and 14 RBI.\nIn 2017, Rojas missed 62 games due to a broken thumb, but still appeared in 90 games, hitting for a .290.361/.375 batting line with one home run and 26 RBI in 272 at-bats. Rojas also led all NL shortstops in September and October with a .354 batting average and .948 OPS. In 2018, Rojas set career-highs in nearly every offensive category; games played (153), runs (44), hits (123), home runs (11), RBI (53), and stolen bases (6).\nIn 2019, Rojas batted .284/.331/.379, with the lowest isolated power in the National League (.095). On September 23, 2019, Rojas agreed to a new two-year contract with the Marlins, worth $10.25 million. In late July 2020, Rojas tested positive for COVID-19. Despite testing positive, Rojas partnered with the company \"Stadium Custom Kicks\" during the 2020 season, branding the partnership as \"Miggy's Locker\". The partnership allowed Rojas to design custom-made cleats to express his passion in shoes and basketball. Overall in 2020, Rojas's batting line was all career-highs, with a .304/.392/.496 line on the year to go along with four home runs and 20 RBI. \nIn 2021, Rojas played in 132 games, collecting 131 hits, 48 RBIs, 13 stolen bases, and a career-high 37 walks. On October 28, 2021, the Marlins signed Rojas to a two-year contract extension worth $10 million.\nOn October 3, 2022, it was announced that Rojas would undergo wrist surgery to repair a torn triangular fibrocartilage complex in his right wrist. He underwent an additional procedure in January after another minor issue arose.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (second stint).\nOn January 11, 2023, Rojas was traded back to the Dodgers in exchange for Jacob Amaya. On February 4, the Dodgers announced a contract extension with Rojas that would pay him $5 million for 2024 and included a $5 million club option for 2025. While initially expected to be a utility player, Rojas wound up the starting shortstop when Gavin Lux went down with a season ending knee injury in spring training. He played in 124 games, batting .236.\nInternational career.\nRojas has played for Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League during the offseason since 2009, which included playing in the 2012 Caribbean Series."

Having started out with his hometown club, Buccaneers, Carty currently plays for the team of his native province of Connacht in the United Rugby Championship, having come through the team's academy.

He was offered a trial with English football club Southampton but turned it down in favour of a trial at West Ham United.\nRugby career.\nConnacht.\nIn his early career with Connacht, Carty primarily featured for the province's secondary team the Connacht Eagles, playing in the British and Irish Cup. Despite still being in the Connacht academy, Carty made his first appearance for the senior Connacht team on 21 September 2012, in a match against the Glasgow Warriors in the 2012–13 Pro12. He was a replacement at fullback for Gavin Duffy, coming on after 28 minutes. In the 2013–14 season, Carty regularly served as the team's captain.

The Massachusetts–Lowell River Hawks, the defending champions from the 2012–13 season, defeated New Hampshire 4-0 to repeat as champions and became the 7th team in league history to successfully defend their title. Sophomore goalie Connor Hellebuyck was named tournament MVP for his 30-save shutout in the championship match that gave the River Hawks Hockey East's automatic bid into the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nThe tournament is the 30th in league history, as the conference entered its 30th year of existence. It was also the first tournament since 2004 that neither Boston College nor Boston University advanced to at least the semifinals, played at the TD Garden.\nFormat.\nWith the addition of Notre Dame to Hockey East, the tournament was reformatted to include all eleven teams in the conference. With eleven being an uneven number, an unorthodox format was needed to achieve a tournament that allowed all eleven teams to participate. A fourth, Opening Round was added before the traditional Quarterfinals, which consists of single-elimination games between the 6-11 seeds hosted by the higher seed, with the 1-5 seeds earning a bye to the next round. The 4 and 5 seeds are guaranteed to play each other whereas the 1-3 seeds will play the winners of the 6-11 seed games, with the highest seeds hosting the lowest seeds remaining. The Quarterfinals through Finals are unchanged from the previous season, with the Quarterfinals consisting of a best-of-three series hosted by the higher seeds, while the Semifinals and Final are single games played at the TD Garden. The tournament champion will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.\nThis tournament format will only be used for the 2013-14 season, as the addition of the UConn Huskies to the conference in the 2014–15 season will bring the total number of teams in the league up to twelve, which allows for a more even, 12-team tournament format. The tournament format following this year will change to a best-of-three Opening Round between 5-11 seeds, with 1-4 seeds earning a bye. The Quarterfinals through Finals will be unchanged.\nRegular season standings.\n\"Note: GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; PTS = Points; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against\"\nResults.\nOpening Round.\nOn March 7–8 the 6-11 seeds will play in single-elimination games to advance to the best-of-three quarterfinals.

        "title": "Claude Julien (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Claude Julien (born April 23, 1960) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. He most recently served as the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to his firing by the Boston Bruins in 2017, he was the longest tenured head coach in the NHL. He had previously served as head coach of the New Jersey Devils in the NHL, as well as in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Hamilton Bulldogs. In 2011 he coached the Bruins to the Stanley Cup Finals, against the Vancouver Canucks, winning in 7 games, guiding Boston to their sixth franchise Stanley Cup title. In 2013, he brought Boston to another Stanley Cup Finals, however they lost the series to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games.\nJulien has also served as assistant and head coach of the Canadian National Team.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Julien played in the 1972 and 1973 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Gloucester, Ontario.\nJulien was an NHL defenceman for the Quebec Nordiques in the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons.\nPrior to playing in the NHL, Julien spent six years in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Oshawa Generals and Windsor Spitfires. Additionally, he has also played in the Central Hockey League (CHL) for the Salt Lake Golden Eagles; in the International Hockey League (IHL) for the Kansas City Blades and the Milwaukee Admirals; and in the AHL for the Fredericton Express, Baltimore Skipjacks, Halifax Citadels and Moncton Hawks.\nCoaching career.\nQMJHL coaching career.\nJulien began his professional coaching career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Hull Olympiques, with whom he won the Memorial Cup in 1997. From 2000 to 2003, he served as head coach for the AHL's Hamilton Bulldogs, the top minor league affiliate of the NHL's Montreal Canadiens.\nIn 2000, Julien won a bronze medal as the head coach of Canadian junior team. He also served as an assistant coach to Marc Habscheid at the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.\nNHL coaching career.\nMontreal Canadiens and New Jersey Devils.\nOn January 17, 2003, Julien became head coach of the Montreal Canadiens. In 2003–04, his first full season as an NHL head coach, he led Montreal to a 93-point performance (41–30–7–4 record) and the second round of the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. He was eventually fired and replaced by General Manager Bob Gainey on January 14, 2006. Julien accumulated a record of 72–62–10–15 during his three seasons with the Canadiens.\nJulien was then announced as the head coach of the New Jersey Devils on June 13, 2006, becoming the 15th head coach in Devils history. On October 6, 2006, he won his first game as Devils head coach with a 4–0 win against the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Carolina Hurricanes. On November 4, Julien won in his first return to Montreal as the Devils defeated the Canadiens, 2–1. On April 2, 2007, Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello abruptly fired Julien with three games to go in the season. This was despite the Devils having a 47–24–8 record, which at the time was leading the Atlantic Division and tied for the second-best record in the Eastern Conference. They were also on their way to setting a franchise record for wins in a season. Lamoriello said that despite the team's stellar record, he did not feel Julien had it ready for the 2007 playoffs. Lamoriello named himself interim head coach for the rest of the season, the second straight season in which Lamoriello left the front office to coach the Devils at the end of the season. Despite the change, the Devils went on to lose in the Eastern Conference Semifinal to the Ottawa Senators.\nBoston Bruins.\nOn June 22, 2007, it was confirmed by various sports websites that Julien had been named as the 28th head coach of the Boston Bruins. In his first season as Boston coach, he led the team back to the playoffs. His team struggled with consistency over the course of the season, but this was in large part due to the many injuries that plagued the Bruins throughout the 2007–08 season. Most notably, forward Patrice Bergeron and goaltender Manny Fernandez missed almost the entire season. The Bruins were defeated in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals by his former team, Montreal, who were coached by Guy Carbonneau, Julien's permanent replacement as head coach, in seven games.\nOn February 17, 2009, Julien coached his 200th win as an NHL head coach, a 5–1 Bruins road game victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. On June 18, 2009, at the end of the 2008–09 season, he was awarded the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year.\nIn the 2010 playoffs, the Bruins became only the third NHL team to lose a best-of-seven series after being up three games to none when they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers (the other two teams were the 1942 Detroit Red Wings and the 1975 Pittsburgh Penguins). Boston held a 3–0 lead in game seven, but the Flyers tied and eventually won the game, 4–3. Injuries to star Bruins forwards David Krejčí (broken wrist), Marco Sturm (torn ACL) and Marc Savard (concussion), as well as defenceman Dennis Seidenberg (wrist) and an undisclosed injury to former Vezina-winning goaltender Tim Thomas (hip), were factors in the defeat.\nThe 2010–11 season saw Julien coach the Bruins to the third-seed in the playoffs and a first round matchup against the rival Montreal Canadiens. After dropping the first two games at home, Julien made some lineup adjustments, and helped his team come back to win the series in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bruins got a chance to redeem themselves from the previous year in a much anticipated series against the Philadelphia Flyers. After winning Game 1, 7–3, they went on to sweep the Flyers out of the playoffs in four games. In the Conference Finals, the Bruins faced off against the Tampa Bay Lightning for their first chance at a Stanley Cup since 1990. The Bruins came out victorious in their second seven-game series of the playoffs, including wins of 6–5, 2–1 and a penalty-less 1–0 win in Game 7.\nThe team's victory set up a Stanley Cup Finals against the number one seed Vancouver Canucks, who possessed the best statistics in offence, defence, goaltending, power play and special teams in the NHL. After a hard-fought Game 1, the Canucks scored the first goal of the game with just 18.5 seconds remaining in the third period, taking the series opener, 1–0. The Bruins, looking to rebound in Game 2, skated to a tie with Vancouver after regulation before a costly mistake by Boston captain Zdeno Chára after just 11 seconds of overtime allowed the Canucks to score the game-winning goal to take a 2–0 series lead. Back in Boston, after a rough first period in which the Bruins lost Nathan Horton to an illegal, concussive hit by Vancouver defenceman Aaron Rome, Boston exploded for four goals in the second period and four more in the third to complete an 8–1 blowout victory. The Bruins followed up that big win with another decisive victory, this time romping 4–0 over the Canucks while chasing goaltender Roberto Luongo, who had surrendered 12 goals in five periods during the two games in Boston. On June 15, 2011, the Bruins won their sixth Stanley Cup championship with a 4–0 victory in Game 7 in Vancouver.\nEntering the 2011 playoffs, Julien's career playoff record in Game 7s was 1–3, with the three losses all coming during his tenure as Boston coach, against Montreal in 2008, Carolina in 2009 and Philadelphia in 2010. His one Game 7 victory came in 2004 as Montreal's coach, ironically \"against\" Boston. With the 2011 playoff game seven wins against Montreal, Tampa Bay and Vancouver, he thus improved his record to 4–3. Additionally in the 2011 playoffs, Julien (now with 33 wins) passed Don Cherry (31 wins) for the most playoff wins by a Boston Bruins coach.\nDuring the 2011–12 regular season, Julien reached multiple personal coaching milestones. On December 17, 2011, he collected his 200th regular season win as Boston's coach in a 6–0 whitewash defeat of the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia Flyers. The win completed a Bruin 41-day journey from the absolute bottom of the Eastern Conference to tied for first place. On January 29, 2012, Julien (and his Bruin bench staff) coached Team Chara to a 12–9 win over Team Alfredsson in the 2012 NHL All-Star Game in Ottawa. It was his second appearance and second win as an All-Star Game coach, having also appeared in the 2009 Game. On March 19, 2012, he coached his 400th game behind the Bruin bench, an 8–0 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs. The win completed a perfect 6–0 sweep of the season series with the Maple Leafs.\nThe 2012 postseason, however, would not be as memorable for Julien's defending Cup champion Bruins, as they fell in the first round to the Washington Capitals and their upstart rookie goaltender Braden Holtby in seven games. The series was the closest, most evenly fought series in NHL history, with all seven games (including four overtime games) being one-goal decisions. After the defeat, Julien's playoff Game 7 record fell to 4–4. Despite the early exit for Boston in the playoffs, the Bruins signed Julien to a new, multi-year contract extension.\nIn the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Julien led his team to their second Stanley Cup Finals in three years. In the first round, they defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games, where in the deciding Game 7, they came back from a 1–4 deficit to win 5–4 in overtime, the first time in NHL playoff history in which a team trailing by three goals in the third period went on to win Game 7 to take the series. The Bruins then eliminated the New York Rangers in five games. Matched up against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals, who were the regular season Conference champions, the Bruins swept them in four games, which included two shutouts of the normally high-scoring Penguins. In the Cup Finals, however, the Bruins lost to the first place Chicago Blackhawks in six games after failing to hold on to third period leads in their Game 1 and Game 6 losses.\nIn the 2013–14 regular season, the first under the League's new conference and division realignment, Julien's team won the Presidents' Trophy for the best regular season record in the NHL.\nIn the 2014–15 regular season, the Bruins failed to make the playoffs for the first time since Julien took over the role as Bruins head coach. On June 5, 2015, Don Sweeney, the Bruins' new general manager, confirmed that Julien and his staff would be staying on for the upcoming 2015–16 NHL regular season. During a six-game roadtrip for the Bruins as part of the team's 2015–16 season, on February 13, 2016, Julien was surprised to learn, after his Bruins team defeated the Minnesota Wild in a 4–2 road victory, that he had coached his 500th NHL winning game. Another achievement for Julien's career in coaching the Bruins would be earned less than a month later; as the result of Julien's coaching the Bruins to a 4–2 home ice win against the 2015 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks on March 3, 2016, Julien won his 387th game for the Bruins, tying Hall of Fame member and Bruins co-founder Art Ross (who led the team on four separate stints ending in 1945) as the winningest coach in franchise history. Only four days later, on March 7, with a Bruins' 5–4 overtime road victory over the Florida Panthers, Julien won his 388th game as Bruins head coach, surpassing Ross as the winningest coach in team history.\nOn February 7, 2017, Julien was relieved of his coaching duties after leading the team with a 26–23–6 record. Julien ended his tenure in Boston with 419 regular-season victories.\nReturn to Montreal.\nOn February 14, 2017, Julien was named the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens after Michel Therrien was relieved of his head coaching duties. This marks the second time in Canadiens franchise history Julien replaced Therrien, the first time being during the 2002–03 regular season.\nOn November 30, 2017, Julien won his 100th game as the Canadiens' coach with a 6–3 win against the Detroit Red Wings.\nOn August 12, 2020, following a loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference First Round, Julien experienced chest pains and was transferred to the hospital. Canadiens general manager Marc Bergevin stated that his chest pains had nothing to do with COVID-19. Kirk Muller, the associate head coach of the Canadiens, assumed the role of head coach for the rest of the first round of playoffs. \nOn August 14, the Canadiens announced that Julien had a stent placed in one of his coronary arteries on August 13. It was also announced that he would be returning to Montreal to rest, and the chances of him being able to rejoin the team before the end of the first round were described by Bergevin as \"very minimal\".\nOn February 6, 2021, Julien won his 200th game as head coach of the Canadiens in a 2–1 win over the Ottawa Senators.\nOn February 24, 2021, Julien and associate coach Kirk Muller were fired by the Canadiens.\nTeam Canada.\nJulien was also an assistant coach for the Canadian national team at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where he helped lead the team to a gold medal victory. He continued as assistant coach for the 2016 World Cup, where the team won the championship.\nJulien was originally intended to be head coach of Team Canada for the 2022 Beijing Olympics. In January 2022, Julien slipped on the ice and fractured his ribs at a training camp in Switzerland. Jeremy Colliton coached the first game while Julien recovered from the injury.\nPersonal life.\nJulien and his wife Karen have one daughter. The family resides in Ottawa, Ontario. They previously resided in Red Bank, New Jersey and Lexington, Massachusetts. Julien was raised in the Orléans suburb of Ottawa. He is bilingual, speaking both French and English fluently."

        "text": "Super Bowl XXXIV (played in January 2000) featured 14 advertisements from 14 different dot-com companies, each of which paid an average of $2.2 million per spot. In addition, five companies that were founded before the dot-com bubble also ran tech-related ads, and 2 before game ads, for a total of 21 different dot-com ads. These ads amounted to nearly 20 percent of the 61 spots available, and $44 million in advertising. In addition to ads which ran during the game, several companies also purchased pre-game ads, most of which are lesser known. All of the publicly held companies which advertised saw their stocks slump after the game as the dot-com bubble began to rapidly deflate.\nThe sheer amount of dot-com-related ads was so unusual that Super Bowl XXXIV has been widely been referred to as the \"Dot-Com Super Bowl\", and it is often used as a high-water mark for the dot-com bubble. Of these companies, four are still active, five were bought by other companies, and the remaining five are defunct or of unknown status.\nEffectiveness.\nMany websites saw short-term gains from the advertisements. LastMinuteTravel.com, for example, reported a surge of 300,000 hits per minute during its advertisement broadcast. In many cases, though, this did not translate into long-term gains. OurBeginning.com's revenue jumped 350% in Q1 of 2000, but its $5 million in advertising costs were still ten times what its customers spent. Short-term gains were not enough to recoup advertising losses, and Pets.com, Computer.com, and Epidemic.com, among many others, would fold before the end of the year.\nLater references.\nLess than a year later, E*Trade ran an ad during Super Bowl XXXV mocking the glut of dot-com commercials during the previous game. The ad featured the chimpanzee from E*Trade's 2000 commercial wandering through a ghost town filled with the remains of fictional dot-com companies, including a direct reference to the already-defunct Pets.com's sock puppet. During the game that year, only three dot-com companies ran advertisements.\nThe dot-com commercials that aired during Super Bowl XXXIV received renewed attention in 2022 following Super Bowl LVI, which featured a large number of cryptocurrency-related ads. Critics drew comparisons between the rise of cryptocurrency and its commercials to the 2000 game's ads and the ensuing dot-com bubble burst, and nicknamed the 2022 game the \"Crypto Bowl\". Following a similar crash in cryptocurrencies, as well as major cryptocurrency exchange FTX filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, it and multiple other cryptocurrency-related companies that had bought ad space for the following Super Bowl (Super Bowl LVII) pulled out, resulting in no cryptocurrency-related ads airing that year.\nIn-game ads.\nThe following list details each company, the commercials they ran, and their ultimate fate. All spots were 30 seconds long.\nCompanies founded before the bubble.\nIn addition to the companies listed above, several tech companies that were founded before the dot-com boom also ran ads. As these are outside the strict definition of a dot-com company, since their founding significantly pre-dated the creation of a dot-com website, they have been listed separately.\nPre-game ads.\nThe following list details companies which ran ads prior to the actual game time."

It was VMI's 5th season in the Big South Conference and the Keydets' 101st season of basketball.\nVMI opened the year with an upset over the Kentucky Wildcats in Rupp Arena on November 14, 2008, by a score of 111–103. After losses to Virginia and Jacksonville State to drop their record to 4–2, VMI then went on a ten-game winning streak and won their first six conference games before falling to Liberty 91–80, in what was the first sellout in the 27-year history of Cameron Hall.\nAfter finishing the regular season with a 22–7 mark, VMI cruised through their first two Big South tournament games, beating Coastal Carolina 96–76 in the quarterfinals and besting Liberty 78–58 in the semifinals. The Keydets ultimately fell to Radford 108–94 in the Big South Championship game, ending their season at 24–8. The 24 wins in a season were the school's second-most all-time, trailing only the 1976–77 team who 26 wins en route to a Sweet 16 appearance.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| 2009 Big South Conference men's basketball tournament"

In 2018, Lehtonen left Tappara by mutual consent and re-joined HV71 of the SHL.\nOn 9 April 2019, Lehtonen as a free agent, left HV71, returning to Finland in signing a two-year contract with KHL participant, Jokerit.\nLehtonen appeared in 60 games with Jokerit during the 2019–20 season and registered 49 points (17 goals, 32 assists), which led all KHL defencemen. He represented Jokerit at the 2020 KHL All-Star Game and was named KHL Defenceman of the Month for three consecutive months from November to January. He had a goal and three assists in six KHL playoff games before the season's cancellation.\nAs a free agent, Lehtonen gained NHL interest, and on 4 May 2020, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Lehtonen to a one-year entry-level contract for the 2020–21 season. With the North American season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 1 August 2020, Lehtonen was returned to Jokerit on loan until the resumption of NHL training camp in November. Lehtonen was released from his contract with Jokerit on 20 November 2020, having collected 17 points through 17 games.\nOn 12 March 2021, Lehtonen was traded by the Maple Leafs to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Veini Vehviläinen.\nAfter the season, Lehtonen signed a one-year contract to return to Columbus. However, on 12 October 2021, it was announced that he was suspended by the team and placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a buyout after failing to report to the Cleveland Monsters, the Blue Jackets AHL affiliate. As a free agent from the Blue Jackets, on 17 October 2021, Lehtonen returned to the KHL in agreeing to a four-year contract with Russian based outfit, SKA Saint Petersburg.\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lehtonen decided to participate in the 2021–22 KHL postseason, despite the exit of most Finnish players and two of the KHL's non-Russia-based teams.\nInternational play.\nInternationally, Lehtonen has represented Finland at multiple events, including the World Championships in 2017 and 2019, winning gold at the 2019 tournament and earning recognition on the World Championship All-Star Team. He also skated for Finland at the Olympic Games in 2018 and 2022, getting gold and recognition on the Olympic All-Star Team at the 2022 games. In addition, he played at the 2014 World Junior Championships, where he captured gold."

        "text": "Rodney Williams, Jr. (born July 23, 1991) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA Development League. Williams played college basketball for four years at the University of Minnesota and then went undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft. He is 6'7\" and plays the small forward position.\nHigh school career.\nWilliams attended Robbinsdale Cooper High School, where he became the schools all-time leading scorer and second in all-time rebounds. In his junior year, the Hawks went 23-9 and reached the state semi-finals. In his senior season, they went an impressive 27-2 losing only to eventual state champions Hopkins and in the section finals to state tournament runner-up Osseo. Williams averaged 15.5 points and 7.6 rebounds per game that season, being named to the Minneapolis Star Tribune all-metro team and the St. Paul Pioneer Press second team all-state.\nCollege career.\nWilliams matriculated at Minnesota in 2009 and pursued a degree in youth studies. He was in danger of being suspended for academics in his freshman season, but managed to become eligible. In his first two games in a Minnesota uniform, he scored 14 points in each. As a freshman, he established himself as a high-flying dunker. Williams was a starter his last three years, but stepped into a larger role his junior year when Trevor Mbakwe missed most of the season for the 2011–12 Golden Gophers. In Mbakwe's absence, Williams finished among the 2011–12 Big Ten Conference leaders in several statistics: rebounds per game (10th, 5.6), steals per game (10th, 1.3), blocked shots per game (4th 1.4), and field goal percentage (5th, 56.4%). Williams led the team scoring (12.2 ppg), rebounding, steals and blocks averages that year, and in the 2012 National Invitation Tournament he averaged 19.2 points and 5.6 rebounds. The following year, upon Mbakwe's return, most of Williams' averages were down slightly, but he still finished among the 2012–13 Big Ten Conference leaders in blocked shots per game (6th 1.3). Part of this is due to a shooting slump he suffered in early 2013. In non-conference games, he averaged 13 point per game. Williams finished his career with 1,145 points, which is 26th on the Gophers scoring list, and became the 19th in the history of Gopher basketball to amass 1,000 points and 500 rebounds in a career. He also finished his career with over 100 blocked shots and held the Gopher basketball record for most games played at 134 until it was broken by Austin Hollins.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, Williams joined the Philadelphia 76ers for the 2013 NBA Summer League. On September 27, 2013, he signed with the 76ers. However, he was later waived by the 76ers on October 27, 2013. In November 2013, he was acquired by the Delaware 87ers.\nOn August 11, 2014, Williams signed with Eisbären Bremerhaven of the Basketball Bundesliga for a three-week trial period. Following the trial period, he was not signed for the season. On January 21, 2015, he was reacquired by the Delaware 87ers. Three days later, he was traded to the Oklahoma City Blue in exchange for a 2015 third-round pick.\nOn October 31, 2016, Williams was acquired by the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA Development League. On March 22, 2017, he was waived by the Swarm after suffering a season-ending injury.\nPersonal.\nWilliams is the son of Rodney and Shanell Williams. He is a childhood friend of Royce White."

        "text": "Joshua LaTrell Smith (born May 14, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Nagoya Diamond Dolphins of the Japanese B.League. He began his college basketball career with the UCLA Bruins before transferring in the middle of his third season, finishing his career with the Georgetown Hoyas.\nSmith was a highly regarded center playing basketball in high school in Washington. He led his team to a state title, and he received multiple individual honors, including Associated Press' state player of the year. He attended college at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was one of the top freshman players in the Pac-10 Conference. He struggled with his weight at UCLA, and he quit the team in the middle of his junior year. He transferred to Georgetown, where he played two seasons. After college, he played two seasons in the NBA Development League (known now as the NBA G League) before playing overseas in the Philippines and Japan.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in Seattle and grew up in Kent, Washington. He was already tall at age five. In the eighth grade, he wrote a report on UCLA Bruins basketball coach John Wooden, and afterwards became a fan of UCLA.\nSmith learned to use his height and weight to his advantage while playing for his Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team, the Seattle Rotary, and then at Kentwood High School. He was in his freshman year, and grew each year until he stood by the end of his junior season. As a senior, he averaged 23.2 points, 15 rebounds and four assists, and led Kentwood to Washington's Class 4A title. He was named Washington's player of the year by Associated Press and earned McDonald's All-American honors and selection into the Jordan Brand Classic.\nHe was ranked by ESPN RISE as the No. 1 center recruit in the nation; Rivals.com ranked him at No. 3, and Scout.com ranked him as No. 4. Smith considered staying home and attending the nearby University of Washington, but he said he \"couldn't pass up the opportunity\" to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nCollege career.\nUCLA.\nAt Smith's first practice with UCLA, coach Ben Howland expressed excitement over Smith's length and size. \"When he is planted on the block, you're not moving him,\" he said. However, Howland was concerned about Smith's mobility, as he weighed after losing over the summer. Smith provided UCLA an inside game they had lacked in recent years. He played in 33 games in 2010–11, starting in 15, and averaged 10.9 points and 6.3 rebounds in 21.7 minutes. He was named to the Pac-10 Conference's All-Freshman team, and showed tremendous potential. However, he had foul trouble and struggled with his conditioning. After starting 13 of his first 15 games, he came off the bench in the next 16 to avoid fouling out. He became a dominant presence late in the season as the Bruins advanced to the third round of the 2011 NCAA tournament. In his last four games, including starts in both tournament games, Smith averaged 13 points and 27 minutes a game. UCLA was eliminated 73–65 by the Florida Gators. Afterwards, a fatigued Smith said, \"I let my team down today.\" Howland thought Smith had a future playing professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA), \"provided he does certain things.\" The coach believed Smith would work on improving his conditioning.\nEntering his sophomore year, Smith was generally considered a favorite to be named All-Pac-10. However, he did not do much to improve his game in the offseason, and he began 2011–12 at roughly the same size if not larger; his conditioning affected his production. His playing time declined, and his fouls per 40 minutes went from a suspect 5.8 as a freshman to an awful 7.3. Smith's average that season fell to 9.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in 17.2 minutes a game. As his fitness level deteriorated, he was not able to play for extended periods of time, and was instead rotated in for two- or three-minute stints. Smith played a total of just 17 minutes in two Pac-10 tournament games. In spite of his fitness and focus issues, some coaches in the Pac-12 (the Pac-10 had expanded by then) considered him the conference's top NBA prospect.\nHe showed improved discipline entering his junior season, having lost since the end of the previous season. His goal was to play 25 to 30 minutes a game. Citing \"personal reasons\", Smith quit UCLA after six games of their 2012–13 season. He averaged 5.2 points and 4.2 rebounds in 13.5 minutes, as his production dropped after each season at UCLA. He was the 11th player to leave the UCLA program since 2008; in early 2012, \"Sports Illustrated\" reported a lack of discipline at UCLA under Howland.\nGeorgetown.\nSmith transferred to Georgetown University, enrolling in January 2013. He practiced with the Hoyas basketball team, but was not allowed to play due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules. He was granted eligibility by the NCAA to play in 2013–14. Listed at , he labored up and down the court, and was limited to playing a few minutes at a time. After playing in the Hoyas first two conference games, Smith missed the remaining 20 games of the season after January 4, 2014, due to academic ineligibility. At the time of his last game, the Hoyas were 10–3, and Smith was averaging 11.5 points but only 3.4 rebounds in 20 minutes. The team was 8–12 in his absence, finishing the season 18–15.\nSmith regained his eligibility prior to the 2014–15 season. He bounced back nicely, and was named one of 15 candidates for the inaugural Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, given to the top center in college basketball. He finished the season ranked second on the team in scoring (10.8) and rebounding (5.8), and was invited to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament.\nProfessional career.\nNBA D-League.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft, Smith played with the Miami Heat in the 2015 NBA Summer League. On September 21, 2015, he signed with the Houston Rockets. After appearing in seven preseason games, he was waived on October 24 in the Rockets' final round of cuts before the regular season.\nOn November 2, 2015, Smith was acquired by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Rockets. As a rookie in 2015–16, he averaged 8.9 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 45 games for the Vipers. As the season progressed, Smith's weight increased and his playing time fell, and he was nearly cut by the Vipers.\nDuring the 2016 offseason, Smith dropped to after working out with a new trainer in preparation for the Las Vegas Summer League. In July 2016, he joined the Milwaukee Bucks summer league team. On October 31, 2016, he was reacquired by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.\nOverseas.\nOn May 17, 2017, Smith signed with TNT KaTropa of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).\nSmith played for Kyoto Hannaryz of the B.League in 2017–18, before returning to TNT in 2018. Late that year, he returned to Japan after signing a two-year contract with the Toyama Grouses."

        "title": "Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team at the 1980 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The 1980 Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team won the gold medal in women's field hockey at that year's Summer Olympics in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. The squad of 16 women, all from Zimbabwe's white minority, was assembled less than a month before the Olympics began to help fill the gaps the American-led Olympic boycott created in the women's hockey competition. Zimbabwe's subsequent victory in the round-robin tournament with three wins and two draws was regarded as a huge upset, particularly considering the team's lack of preparation and experience; it has been called an \"irresistible fairy story\". Won at a time of great political transition in Zimbabwe, the gold medal was the country's first Olympic medal of any colour.\nThe 1980 Olympics were first to feature women's hockey, and the first to include Zimbabwe under that name—barred from the last three Olympics for political reasons, the country had last competed as Rhodesia in 1964. The women's hockey matches, held between 25 and 31 July, were all played on artificial turf, which none of the Zimbabwean team members had ever seen; they had also never played together until that month. After beating Poland and the USSR and drawing with Czechoslovakia and India, the Zimbabweans won the competition on the final day with a 4–1 victory over Austria. Dubbed the \"Golden Girls\" by the media of Zimbabwe, they were met by cheering crowds on their return home, and were briefly national celebrities. Zimbabwe did not win another Olympic medal until 2004.\nInvitation and team selection.\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, were the first to include a competition in women's field hockey. Pre-tournament favourites included Australia, the Netherlands and West Germany, but the American-led Western boycott of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified. Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of civil war. Moscow marked the southern African nation's return to the Olympics after 16 years; as Rhodesia it had been excluded from the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Games for political reasons following the mostly white government's declaration of independence from Britain in 1965. The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received the invitation to send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start. They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a women's squad. No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.\nA squad of 16 members, built around the core of the former Rhodesia team, was hastily assembled by Liz Dreyer, the president of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white. Ann Grant, the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. Anthea Stewart, who had played for South Africa 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while Arlene Boxall, the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in Sandy Chick and Sonia Robertson.\nEntirely amateur, the team mostly comprised players with professions unrelated to sport—Grant, for example, was a bookkeeper, while Boxall was an operations clerk in the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer Duncan Fletcher. Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee who had played for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor. The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital Lusaka and then to Luanda in Angola, from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat. \"The stench was terrible\", Grant later said. \"There were no seats, so we all sat on the floor, strapped in and set off into the unknown. We didn't even have the right shoes to play on the artificial hockey surface.\"\nTournament.\nThe event was organised as a round-robin tournament in which each of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July. Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were Austria, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland and the USSR; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing as a result of the boycott, having failed to qualify initially. All of the matches were played at Dynamo Minor Arena in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start, and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams. The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—\"none of us had ever seen it before\", Chick recalled—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit. They considered themselves serious underdogs and did not expect to win a medal.\nZimbabwe played in the first women's Olympic hockey match, facing Poland on 25 July. Pat McKillop scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before Pat Davies, Linda Watson and Chase each added one more to round off a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals. A 1–1 draw with India on 30 July put Zimbabwe in first place before the final round of matches on the 31st. Zimbabwe had to beat Austria to be sure of winning the gold.\nStewart declared the team's first-choice white-and-blue outfit \"lucky\" on the basis that both Zimbabwe's victories had been won wearing it (as opposed to the two draws wearing green), and expressed joy that they would again be wearing white and blue in the deciding match. According to Glen Byrom, covering the event for the \"Herald\" newspaper, the Zimbabweans appeared nervous during the opening stages of the game, and were fortunate not to go behind after 15 minutes, when Austria missed a clear chance. Chick opened the scoring after 28 minutes, receiving the ball from a corner before cleanly stroking it into the net. Austria's Brigitte Kindler equalised two minutes later from a penalty stroke, flicking the ball beyond Zimbabwean goalkeeper Sarah English into the top-left corner of the goal. With the score 1–1 at half time, Brenda Phillips replaced Christine Prinsloo at right-half.\nUrged on by a small but loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans improved after the break and, according to Byrom, \"ke[pt] the Austrian goal under siege\" throughout the second half. With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a short corner that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans \"simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey\", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. Gillian Cowley made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's free hit was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a through pass from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported \"incredible scenes of unrestrained joy\" at the final buzzer—\"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other\". Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.\nA few hours later, the Zimbabwean players returned to the field wearing their blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.\nZimbabwe finished the tournament undefeated, having scored the most goals and conceded the fewest of any team. The six goals from Pat McKillop, a housewife from Bulawayo, made her the competition's joint top scorer with the USSR's Natella Krasnikova. Chase, despite nursing a knee injury, played in all five matches and scored three goals. All of the Zimbabwean squad members played at least one match except for Boxall, who never came off the bench, but still received a gold medal.\nReactions and legacy.\nThe victorious hockey players were immediately dubbed the \"Golden Girls\" by Zimbabwean reporters. They were greeted by huge crowds on their return to Zimbabwe and briefly became national celebrities. Prime Minister Robert Mugabe welcomed them home at an official function. Each member of the team was promised an ox by the Prime Minister's wife Sally, but ultimately received a polystyrene package of meat instead at a ceremony hosted by Mrs Mugabe. Many of the players emigrated over the following years, mostly to South Africa. Their victory continues to be celebrated in Zimbabwe today. The country did not win another Olympic medal until Kirsty Coventry won three swimming medals in Athens in 2004. Robert Mugabe promptly applied the \"golden girl\" nickname to her on her return home.\nThe Zimbabwean hockey team's victory at the 1980 Olympics was widely considered a great upset. Sports historians have called it a \"fairytale\" and an \"irresistible fairy story\". While the Zimbabweans were overjoyed by their unlikely status as the first ever Olympic gold medallists in women's hockey, some, including Robert Sullivan of \"Sports Illustrated\", felt that the Zimbabwean victory epitomised how the Western boycott had lowered competitive standards and, in their opinion, \"ruined\" the 1980 Olympics. While acknowledging this to an extent, Cathy Harris asserted in her 2008 retrospective on the team, published in \"The Sunday Times\", that the victory still deserved to be recognised as a great achievement. \"They freely acknowledge that they won the gold medal without competing against the best in the world\", she concludes, \"but, like many athletes in Moscow in 1980, they seized their chance.\""

The federation was governing these two sports since 1967, when ice hockey was split off to form the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation; ice hockey had only been introduced to the Soviet Union some twenty years earlier.\nThe federation was one of the founding members of the Federation of International Bandy in 1955.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, the federation was replaced by the All Russian Bandy Federation in early 1992. For field hockey, the Russian Field Hockey Federation was created in its place.\nThe following former states of the Soviet Union now have their own bandy federations: Russia (founded in 1992), Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan Bandy Federation, 1993), Belarus (Belarusian Bandy Federation, 1999), Estonia (Estonian Bandy Association, 2002), Kyrgyzstan (Bandy Federation of Kyrgyzstan, 2004), Latvia (Latvia's Bandy Federation, 2006), Ukraine (Ukrainian Bandy and Rink bandy Federation, 2007), and Lithuania (Lithuanian Bandy Association, 2008)."

        "text": "Betty Faith Jaynes (September 1, 1945 – February 10, 2014) was an American basketball coach. She played basketball in high school in Georgia, and coached basketball at James Madison University. She was the first executive director of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association and is inducted into several sports halls of fame. Jaynes was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000.\nEarly years and education.\nBorn in Covington, Georgia, Jaynes attended Newton County High School and lettered in basketball for four years. Jaynes played as a stationary guard, which dates to the existence of six-on-six basketball. She earned all-state player honors in her junior and senior years. As a senior, she helped her team to a 33–1 record and a place in the Class AA state championship game in 1963. Jaynes earned her Bachelor of Science degree in physical education in 1967 from the Women's College of Georgia, now known as Georgia College &amp; State University, in the school's last graduating class before it became coeducational that fall. She went on to earn a Master of Science in the same field from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1968. \nCollege coaching career.\nJaynes became the head coach of the women's basketball team at Madison College (now James Madison University) in 1970. She continued in that position until 1982, with her teams amassing a record of 142–114.\nFormation of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association.\n1981 was a key year in the history of women's basketball. The AIAW had been conducting post-season tournaments for years, but the NCAA decided to offer a women's basketball tournament starting in 1982. While some coaches preferred the AIAW and some preferred the NCAA, there was no organization of coaches to express the position of the coaching community on this or any other issue. While there was an existing organization of basketball coaches, the NABC, it was an association of men's team coaches, and the organization was not prepared to expand their remit to women's team coaches. With no other suitable alternatives, some of the leading coaches met in 1981 to consider forming an association. Later in the year, a formal organizational meeting convened, and Betty Jaynes was selected as the interim executive director. The organization quickly dropped the \"interim\" modifier, and Jaynes would go on to serve as Executive Director for 15 years, then \"retire\" and continue as a consultant.\nDeath.\nShe died at age 68 at a hospice in Athens, Georgia, following a brief illness."

It follows the relationship between a college football player and his girlfriend.\nPlot.\nQualifying to play in the illustrious Rose Bowl football game on New Year's Day, a Midwestern college's quarterback, Steve Davis, is not as happy as he should be because playing football does not excite him, but his teammate Bronc Buttram is thrilled. Their coach, Jim Hadley, is equally pleased because his ill wife has gone to warmer Glendale, California for her health, so he will now be able to spend more time with her.\nSteve perks up in Pasadena while meeting the Rose Bowl's committee and particularly the tournament's queen, Denny Burke, a beauty in a fur coat. Steve believes she is wealthy as well as beautiful and manages to get her telephone number. He cannot get through, however, because Denny's younger sister Sally is always tying up the phone.\nFinding her house, Steve learns she is a middle-class girl whose dad, \"Iron Mike\" Burke, once played in a Rose Bowl game himself. Denny takes exception to Steve's disappointment that she is not rich and to his blasé attitude toward the Rose Bowl, a tradition her family loves. The self-involved Steve develops a guilty conscience.\nAgreeing to spend New Year's Eve with her family, Steve stands up Denny because he is at the hospital, where Coach Hadley's wife has taken a turn for the worse. He gets busy signals phoning because Sally's hogging it again. Next morning, Bronc explains to Denny and she is relieved. At the game, the coach announces his wife's going to be all right. Steve leads the team to victory, unselfishly letting Bronc score the winning touchdown. He and Denny are in love and plan to marry."

Captained by Khan Mohammad, they drew the match, finishing on 214 for 7 in pursuit of 275 for victory. They lost their next match, against the Indians in 1954–55, by an innings, and drew against an MCC team in 1955–56.\nThey lost to a Commonwealth XI in 1967–68 after their captain, Majid Khan declared twice to keep the game alive. They drew a match against the Sri Lankans in 1973–74, and also their last first-class match, against Sri Lanka B in 1988–89.\nDomestic competition.\nPakistan Universities entered the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1958–59, having the better of a draw against Railways before losing on the first innings to Lahore. They had a draw and a loss in 1959–60, when in the draw against East Pakistan, Asif Ahmed, on his first-class debut, hit their first century, 148, and Javed Saeed took 8 for 36, which remained the team's best bowling figures. They suffered three losses by large margins in 1962–63, when their totals were 130, 94, 102, 98, 111 and 89.\nThey next appeared in first-class competitions in 1972–73, playing in the Patron's Trophy. In the first match, against Public Works Department, they dominated a draw, the captain Wasim Raja taking 5 for 77 and 5 for 23 and scoring 117.

The creation of the first winter games allowed for many athletes of the era to compete in both sets of games in the same discipline, and on this page these athletes are listed below the main list. The Russian athlete Nikolai Panin is unique in having competed in both a summer sport (shooting in 1912) and a winter sport (figure skating in 1908) but only competing at the Summer Olympics.\nAmong these athletes, the most-occurring combination is bobsledding and athletics, followed by cycling and speed skating. Other events competed in by Summer and Winter Olympians include fencing, track and field, sailing, ski jumping, and equestrian events. Only six of the 139 athletes won medals in both the Summer or Winter Olympics. \nEddie Eagan and Gillis Grafström were the only two athletes to win gold medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Grafström has the further distinction of being the only person to have won an individual gold medal in both the Summer (1920) and Winter Olympics (1924, 1928), meanwhile Eagan remains the only athlete to have managed the feat in different disciplines. Some of the Olympians competed in both sets of games over a span of different decades.\nUncertain athletes.\nThe next 23 athletes have an uncertain status: they haven't participated at one (or more) of 2 or more sports but their appearance in the Olympic official website is considered official. Some of them have been already included in the list above. There are also some contrasts between Olympedia and the Olympics official website regarding the number of appearances.\nSports and years in bold are those sports and years that are considered as official in the Olympics website or Olympedia but the athletes haven't participated in those years at those sports (or 1 out of more times)."

        "text": "David Griffin (born November 16, 1973) is an American professional basketball executive who is the executive vice president of basketball operations for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Prior to the Pelicans, served as the general manager for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who won the NBA championship in 2016 and reached the NBA Finals in three consecutive seasons under his watch. Griffin also worked as an analyst for NBA TV.\nEarly life.\nGriffin was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. He attended high school at Brophy College Preparatory. He enrolled at the University of Arizona but transferred to Arizona State University in 1993 in order to accept an internship with the Phoenix Suns organization. Griffin completed a bachelor's degree in Political Science in 1995.\nEarly basketball career.\nGriffin started as a tournament director for the NIKE Desert Classic pre-draft camp. He was also an assistant coach at Scottsdale Community College. Later, he worked as part of the basketball press information team during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.\nExecutive career.\nPhoenix Suns.\nGriffin spent 17 seasons with the Phoenix Suns, beginning with an internship with the team's public relations department in 1993 while he was still a student at Arizona State University. He was hired as a full-time media relations assistant after three years as an intern. Being noticed by Jerry Colangelo and then-coach Danny Ainge for his detailed notes for the media, Griffin joined the team's basketball operations side via the video department in 1997. He spent his last three years in the club as senior vice president of basketball operations after being named to the position in June 2007.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nIn September 2010, Griffin was named vice president of basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers. On February 6, 2014, he was named the acting general manager for the Cavaliers, after the firing of Chris Grant from that position. In his first trade since becoming acting GM, Griffin traded forward Earl Clark, center Henry Sims, and draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for center Spencer Hawes. On May 12, 2014, the Cavaliers announced that Griffin would be named as permanent, full-time general manager.\nIn the following weeks after being named permanent GM, Griffin brought in Euroleague Champion and Coach of the Year David Blatt as head coach, drafted Andrew Wiggins with the number one pick in the 2014 NBA draft, signed LeBron James back four years after the infamous \"Decision\", and acquired All-Star forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a trade. In order to acquire Love, Griffin gave Wiggins and former 1st overall pick Anthony Bennett to the Wolves. As a result of these moves and many others, Griffin placed second in the NBA Executive of the Year Award voting for the 2014–15 season. Griffin and the Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA Finals after defeating the 73-win Golden State Warriors in seven games, becoming the first team in league history to overcome a 3–1 deficit in the Finals.\nGriffin's Cavaliers set offensive records in the 2017 playoffs, setting a playoff scoring efficiency record by scoring 120 points per 100 possessions, but ultimately lost in five games in the 2017 Finals to a revamped Warriors team that added Kevin Durant to their 73-win core.\nOn June 19, 2017, both Griffin and Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert announced that they would not renew their contract together after no agreement between the two sides could be reached. He would ultimately be replaced by the Cavaliers' assistant general manager, Koby Altman, over a month later on July 24. Gilbert was widely criticized for failing to come to terms on a new contract with Griffin.\nFor a \"Sports Illustrated\" article released Thursday August 1, 2019, David Griffin expressed in detail his experience working with and building a supporting cast of team members around LeBron James. He described the ordeal and time in Cleveland doing so as \"miserable\" and elaborating how \"he privately wept the night the Cavaliers won the title, saying he was so obsessed with winning that he \"didn't love the game anymore.\"\nNew Orleans Pelicans.\nOn April 17, 2019, the New Orleans Pelicans named Griffin as the executive vice president of basketball operations. Griffin represented the Pelicans during the 2019 NBA draft lottery, where they won the right to the number 1 overall pick which they used to select Zion Williamson. In May 2021, after Williamson fractured his ring finger, Griffin accused opposing teams of physically targeting the star. He said, \"There's more violence encouraged in the paint against Zion Williamson than any other player I've seen since [Shaquille O'Neal]...It was egregious and horrific then, and the same is true now.\"\nOn October 29, 2021, following a loss to the Sacramento Kings, Griffin reportedly found himself in conflict with Kings assistant head coach Alvin Gentry, who had been the Pelicans' head coach. According to reports, the two men engaged in argument and had to be physically separated.\nPersonal life.\nGriffin is originally from Phoenix, Arizona, and now resides in Sonoma, California with his wife Meredith. Griffin was raised by a single mother in a Maryvale neighborhood of lower middle-class West Phoenix. He has a younger brother Daniel and he went to the Jesuit-run Brophy Prep for high school. He had three bouts with testicular cancer– in 2006, 2011 and 2017. In between the Cleveland and New Orleans stints, Griffin appeared frequently on NBA TV and hosted a weekly Sirius XM radio show called ‘Deals and Dunks’ with Pelicans broadcaster Joel Meyers as co-host. Griffin also enjoys playing piano and was reported to have attempted to win the heart of star forward Zion Williamson with a song, in the NBA Bubble in Orlando. This has been denied by both Williamson and Griffin himself during a Pelicans media event."

Allen started his career with Irish provincial side Ulster, before signing for Scottish side Edinburgh in 2015. However, after finishing with Edinburgh in 2017, Allen decided to retire from the sport at the age of 26 to focus on his family life.\nEarly life.\nAllen was educated at Methodist College Belfast. He twice won the Ulster Schools' Cup, scoring several tries in the 2009 Semi-Final as the school won the cup two years running, beating Regent House in 2008 and R.B.A.I in 2009.\nHe attended his first rugby match at only two weeks old to watch his father play for what is now Belfast Harlequins and spent his childhood at the club.\nAllen's mother, Corinne, is a former Northern Ireland Netball international and his sister also excelled at the sport.\nUlster.\nAllen has represented Ulster Rugby at Under 18, Under 19 level and Academy level. He also played for the Ulster Ravens in the British and Irish Cup Semi-Final in 2010 against Munster A.\nHe made his Ulster first team debut against Leinster at The RDS in 2012 and was awarded with a Senior Ulster Contract in 2013.\nIn the 2012–13 season, Allen scored his first senior Ulster try against Cardiff Blues and was named on the bench for the Final, coming on in the 64th minute in the 24–18 defeat to Leinster.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Allen made his breakthrough playing Wing due to injuries to Tommy Bowe and Andrew Trimble, scoring a try against Connacht and two against Treviso. He has spoken about the competition he faces at wing with Bowe, Trimble and Craig Gilroy, who are all Ireland Internationals, saying \"Obviously they're three world class players but I can't dwell on that. I have to try and make the most of the game time that I get but at the same time I recognise how tough it is. My priority is to play well enough to ensure that Mark (Anscombe, Ulster coach) has a decision to make each week.\"\nIreland.\nAllen represented Ireland Schools at under-19 Level.\nIn 2013, Allen was selected for the Emerging Ireland squad to play at the 2013 IRB Tbilisi Cup in Georgia where he scored a try in a 19–8 defeat to South Africa President's XV.

        "text": " is a Japanese ice hockey player, and is considered one of her country's best defenseman. She is the only player to qualify for both the 1998 and 2014 Winter Olympics. Kondo is the oldest player on the 2014 team, for which she switched to the forward position.\nBiography.\nYoko Kondo was born on February 13, 1979, in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture. She began playing ice hockey at age six in Aomori, largely because her older brother played the game and she wanted to follow him. She began playing ice hockey professionally in 1995, and qualified for Japan's first Olympic women's ice hockey team during the 1998 Winter Olympics. Kondo felt she personally lacked physical strength to compete with foreign players, and that the team was not playing at a level capable of winning due to the lack of clear goals and a consistent training program. She believed if the team continued to improve, they could eventually qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nKondo participated in four Division I International Ice Hockey Federation world championship tournaments between 2001 and 2013, with Japan placing second in 2001 and 2005, first in 2007, and fourth in 2013. She plays as a defenseman with the Seibu Princess Rabbits in the Japan Women's Ice Hockey League, while also employed professionally as an office worker. In January 2014, Ilzuka Yuji, head coach of the Japan women's national ice hockey team, played Kondo as a forward in a friendly match and found her speed, body size and powerful shots suited her for the role. Yuji decided to play Kondo as forward in the 2014 Winter Olympics, although she only started seriously training in the position in December 2013.\nAt age 35, Kondo was the oldest player on the Japan's 2014 Olympic team, and the only one with past Olympic experience. In contrast to 1998, Kondo felt the team is better prepared to compete and had a clear strategy to win."

After four provincial minor championships, he was promoted to the Junior A New Westminster Salmonbellies. He helped lead the 'Bellies to the 1960 Minto Cup with a 21-1 record and an 0.810 save percentage in the regular season.\nIn 1962, Comeau was forced to split his time between the New Westminster Salmonbellies of the ICLL and Port Coquitlam of the Senior B loop. In Senior B, he led Port Coquitlam to a provincial title. By 1964, he was full-time with the Salmonbellies. He also played a stint with the Coquitlam Adanacs.\nIn 1968, Comeau turned professional with the relocated Portland Adanacs in the National Lacrosse Association, but rejoined the Salmonbellies for the 1969 NLA season.

Late in the 1976 season, his Salmonbellies were suffering a bad season, and he came out of retirement to turn their season around, win the league and a fourth Mann Cup. He then retired for a third and final time.\n\"Quiet Man\" Comeau was elected into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1983.

Battulga Gombo, the founder of MCA, has become the cricket coach after finishing with Cricket Australia.\nActivities.\nIn Mongolia, MCA members and some alumni from Australian universities expressed their interest to support the activities run by the Association. Initially, MCA aimed to organize regular training sessions at some secondary schools in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. MCA sent some cricket equipment to Mongolia for Mongolian cricketers and students helping them get into the game. The first cricket introductory program in Mongolia was launched by MCA at secondary school number 34 in May 2013 in Ulaanbaatar. The cricket program had a duration of four weeks and it resumed during the next school term. MCA planned to introduce cricket into more secondary schools in Ulaanbaatar."

Dolan attended high school at the Gilmour Academy in Gates Mills, Ohio, and upon graduation attended college at St. Lawrence University, and upon graduation went on to earn his Juris Doctor at Notre Dame Law School in 1983.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from law school, Dolan was hired as an attorney for his father's law firm (Thrasher, Dinsmore, and Dolan), eventually becoming a partner in 1992.\nIn 2000, Larry Dolan purchased the Cleveland Indians baseball team. Upon his father taking control of the team, Dolan was hired as a vice president and general counsel. In 2004, Dolan was promoted to team president, and in 2011 promoted again to chairman/CEO.\nIn 2013, Dolan was approved by the team owners of MLB as the \"control person\" of the Indians; the Associated Press describes this new role as \"controlling owner\". This new designation means that Dolan oversees the day to day team operations, and is responsible for compliance with MLB rules and regulations.\nThough officially listed as Chairman/CEO by the team, Dolan is sometimes referred to as an owner of the Guardians, as the team is considered to be a family asset due to being purchased through various Dolan Family trusts.\nFamily.\nDolan's son Peter was selected by the Guardians in the 33rd round of the 2014 MLB Draft as a third baseman out of Gilmour Academy. His brother Matt is a state senator in Ohio, and his cousin James is owner of the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL)."

During the 1930s Australian Frederick McEvoy competed with the Great Britain team in bobsleigh to win several Olympic and World Championship medals.\nThis early success wavered after World War Two. When Australians started traveling to Europe in the early 1970s some thrill-seekers were exposed to the sports of bobsleigh and skeleton. Leading the way for the new wave of Australians becoming interested in the sport was Philip Morgan Giles. Morgan Giles piloted the first Australian team to compete at an FIBT world championship in 2-man bobsleigh in 1974.\nThe Australian Bobsleigh Federation was established in 1985. This allowed Australia to become a recognised member of the Federation de Internationale Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT). This paved the way forward for Australian teams to compete in FIBT races and compete at the Olympic Games.\nAustralia has sent 8 Skeleton athletes and 29 Bobsleigh athletes to 8 Winter Olympic Games.\nBobsleigh and Skeleton Australia was established in 2013 to govern the sports of bobsleigh and skeleton within Australia. It is the recognised governing body for bobsleigh and skeleton for Australia with the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation."

As the Australian Sports Commission requires sports to have a single governing body to be officially recognised, the two bodies put their differences aside in the greater interests of the sport.\nStructure.\nThe national body has currently four state member associations: Sport Climbing Victoria, Sport Climbing Queensland, Sport Climbing Tasmania and Sport Climbing NSW/ACT. \nCompetition Sport Climbing South Australia and Sport Climbing Western Australia are pending membership."

        "title": "Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The Arthur Dunn Cup is a football cup competition played between the Old Boys of public schools. It started in 1903 and is named in honour of Arthur Dunn who had proposed such a competition but died very suddenly shortly after. Dunn was a leading amateur player of his day and was in the winning Old Etonians side in the 1882 FA Cup Final. It was Dunn who passed the ball to Anderson who scored the only goal to defeat Blackburn Rovers at the Kennington Oval. The Arthur Dunn Cup is presented by Jane Sawyer, granddaughter of Arthur Dunn.\nOrigins of the Cup Competition.\nOn 12 October 1901, an article appeared in a newspaper headed \"Amateur Clubs and the English Cup\". It began \"It has been said that amateur football is in the decline, that it is not what it was, and that its ultimate insignificance is, in fact, merely a matter of time\". This reflected the growing impression that amateur football was doomed and when Arthur Dunn read this, he was so moved that he wrote a brief note to another Old Etonian, Norman Malcolmson, as follows:\nArthur did not have time to follow this thought through because he died suddenly on the evening of 19 February 1902. (Other sources state the date of death as 20 February and this is the date on his memorial at Eton College). However, on 12 March 1902, just three weeks later, an informal meeting of Old Boys interested in amateur football was convened by Norman Malcolmson and held at the Sports Club. At this meeting the following resolutions were passed:\nThose present also expressed the view that any surplus profits from the competition should be given to charity. This informal meeting was followed, three weeks later, by a formal one, at which the chair was taken by no less a figure that C Wreford-Brown, a pillar of the Corinthians and capped four times for England in full internationals. The motions passed by the informal meeting were unanimously confirmed, and then officers were elected as follows:\nPresident: Lord Kinnaird (Eton); Vice-Presidents: R C Guy (Forest); R C Gosling (Eton); Committee: R T Squire (Westminster), G O Smith (Charterhouse), W J Oakley (Shrewsbury), C Wreford-Brown (Charterhouse), R E Foster (Malvern), W M Cowan (Brighton), J R Mason (Winchester).\nHon Secretary: N Malcolmson.\nDuring the next few weeks a special committee drew up the rules of the competition. Meanwhile, the actual trophy was presented by R C Gosling; and thus, within 14 weeks of Dunn’s death, the vision had become a reality. Six months later the Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup competition was well and truly launched, the schools taking part in the first season being:\nBradfield, Brighton, Charterhouse, Eton, Felsted, Forest, Harrow, Lancing, Malvern, Repton, Rossall, Shrewsbury, Westminster and Winchester. Radley College decided not to participate at this stage.\nThe first Winners.\nThe first Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup Final was held on 28 March 1903 at The Crystal Palace. The two teams at that first final were Old Carthusians and Old Salopians. In a keen and close game, the result was a draw (2 – 2) even after 20 minutes extra time and it was decided to replay at Ealing on Wednesday 1 April. Coincidentally this game too ended in a 2 – 2 draw, and so it was then decided that the Cup should be held jointly by these two clubs, six months each.\nThe first 100 Finals.\nThe first 25 Finals were dominated by the Old Carthusians who appeared in 11 Finals and won the Cup nine times. The Old Malvernians appeared in nine Finals and won the Cup six times. During these years the Old Carthusians won the Cup every year between 1903 and 1906 and in 1921/2/3. The Old Malvernians also won the Cup three years in succession on 1924/5/6.\nIn all, 11 different sides reached the Final and the Old Brightonians, who won the Cup in 1913, are the only winners that no longer play in the competition. In November 1913, Warren Lewis, then a student at Malvern College and the older brother of C. S. Lewis, was in attendance for a portion of the competition.\nThe Second World War interfered with the second 25 Finals so the 50th Final was not played until 1964. Again, 11 sides reached the Finals and the Old Salopians were the most dominant side reaching 10 Finals and winning seven times, including the 50th Final. They were followed by the Old Carthusians who reached eight Finals and won on seven occasions.\nFifteen of the 16 Finals played between 1933 and 1955 were won by only three sides - Old Carthusians, Old Salopians and Old Wykehamists. The Wykehamists shared the Cup with the Old Malvernians in 1938 and the Old Salopians shared it with the Old Brentwoods in 1955. There were three new winners in this period, the Old Aldenhamians in 1934, the Old Brentwoods and the Old Cholmelians in 1958 and 1959 respectively. \nThe third quarter of the 100 Finals were dominated by those arch rivals, the Old Malvernians, who played in 13 Finals and won the Cup on eight occasions, and the Old Reptonians who played in six Finals and won it five times.\nAgain, 11 sides reached the Finals in this period but there were three new sides who made their mark. Lancing Old Boys played in four Finals and won the Cup in successive years between 1983-5 (the last side to win three years in a row), the Old Chigwellians won in 1980 and the Old Foresters won in 1974. The Old Brentwoods appeared in 11 Finals but only managed to win the Cup on four occasions. The 75th Final in 1989 was between the Old Malvernians and the Old Brentwoods.\nIn the last 24 years, 14 sides have reached the Final and from a much wider range. Substitutes were first allowed in 1997 when Old Foresters won the Cup. Yet once again, the Old Carthusians have been the most dominant side, reaching eight Finals, seven of them in the last 13 years when they have won the Cup six times. The Old Salopians have appeared in six Finals winning the Cup on four occasions including the Centenary Final in 2003. This Final was held at Cobham. Unsurprisingly, the finalists were Old Salopians and Old Carthusians who had met in the first Final in 1903. Old Salopians won 2 – 1.\nThe Old Etonians at last won the Cup (Arthur Dunn being an Old Etonian) in 2005 and 2010. The Old Harrovians won for the first time on 2007 and the Old Tonbridgians won in 2012 becoming the first of the newer Old Boys teams to win the Cup.\nOver this period, the Cup competition has been supported by Arthur Dunn's wife, Helen Dunn, his daughter Mary Shirley and his granddaughter, Jane Sawyer.\nThe 100th Final.\nThe 100th Final was a repeat of the first final between the Old Salopians and the Old Carthusians. Unlike the first final where the Old Carthusians and the Old Salopians shared the title after a drawn replay, the Old Salopians won the centenary final 2-1."

The club house was designed by Henning Larsen Architects. The location - previously a clay pit and for the latest 60 years - a military practice area, is situated just north of Farum, Furesø Municipality, Denmark\nConstruction.\nThe golf courses are located in the former training grounds of Farum Barracks. It was established by Peter Frithjof Bang, Torben Wind and Jesper Balser, who after having sold the IT company Navision bought the 200+ hectare area in 2002. After four years of negotiating with the local community RTJ II with president and principal designer Bruce Charlton spent the following four years to develop two sand capped golf courses with more than 100 km of drainage, 2000 irrigation heads all fed from surface water in large lakes on just 25 percent of the exceptional area packed with fauna og flora. Rain will not stop play as the drain will carry away up to 100 millimeters of water per hour.\nThe facilities.\nOld Course opened in 2010 and New Course followed one year later. Golf Digest, USA, have recently analyzed 206 countries in the world to find the best courses, and in Denmark New Course is ranked #1 and Old Course #2. Golf World, UK, states that The Scandinavian is the only golf venue in Europe with both courses ranked in Top 50. Besides the courses there is a driving range with the possibility of playing in different wind directions. A large short game area is located next to covered bays with TrackMan gear free of use for the Members of the club. Four large putting greens is accessible close to the first and 10th teeboxes of both courses.\nThe award-winning club house stands on a small plateau. Its most distinctive feature is the sculptural roof, which relies on traditional Scandinavian stave churches for inspiration. The materials used are mainly Douglas-Pine, slate, glass and Tombak.\nCultural references.\nEgon (Ove Sprogøe) hands a stolen Ming vase over to a client at hole 17 of the Scandinavian Golf Course at 0:17:06 in the 1978 \"Olsen-banden\" film \"The Olsen Gang Sees Red\"."

        "text": "Modern Baseball (sometimes abbreviated as \"MoBo\") was an American emo band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania consisting of Bren Lukens, Jake Ewald, Sean Huber, and Ian Farmer. The band formed in 2012 at Drexel University and released their first album, \"Sports\", on Lame-O Records that same year. Their following albums, \"You're Gonna Miss It All\" and \"Holy Ghost\", were released on Run For Cover Records in 2014 and 2016 respectively. The group announced an indefinite hiatus in 2017.\nHistory.\nEarly years and success (2011–2016).\nBren Lukens and Jake Ewald met in high school, when Lukens was interested in Ewald's twin sister. They ran in different friend groups, but found common ground through music. Their name was inspired by a book that Lukens and Ewald found in Ewald’s basement, titled \"Modern Baseball Techniques\".\nOriginally from Brunswick, Maryland, they relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to attend college, with Lukens at Chestnut Hill College, and Ewald at Drexel University. In Philadelphia, they met fellow music lover Ian Farmer, who helped them record their first album, \"Sports\", in Drexel's recording studios. \"Sports\" was released in 2012, and soon after the group left college temporarily to pursue music as their profession.\nThe band's first concert was in their shared house near Drexel University. The price of entry was either $3 or a picture of Michael Jordan. The house was later dubbed \"The Michael Jordan House\", which became a center for underground bands in the area. The music video for \"The Weekend\" was centered within various parts of the house, including its basement.\nThe quartet started playing house shows around the area with bands like The Menzingers, Lee Hartney, Ted Nguyent, and Cayetana. Around this time, the band also signed with Run For Cover Records. \nThe group's second full-length album, \"You're Gonna Miss It All\", was released on Run For Cover Records in 2014, reaching #97 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The group toured the United States in early 2014 with The Wonder Years. Modern Baseball toured the United Kingdom in September 2014. The band spoke ahead of their tour explaining how they manage their busy schedules. This followed a tour of the United States in a headlining spot with other bands Knuckle Puck, Foxing, Crying, and Somos.\nIn late 2015, the band announced plans for their third album that would be released in 2016 through Run For Cover Records, titled \"Holy Ghost\". On February 25, 2016, the band announced that the album would be released on May 13 via Run For Cover and on Big Scary Monsters in the UK/Europe. \"Holy Ghost\" was produced by Joe Reinhart at Headroom Studios, in Philadelphia.\nIn May 2016, Modern Baseball embarked on The Holy Ghost Tour with Thin Lips and Joyce Manor. In fall 2016, Modern Baseball supported Brand New on tour along with The Front Bottoms. In December 2016, Ewald released the album \"Welcome\" as Slaughter Beach, Dog on Lame-O Records.\nHiatus (2017).\nIn January 2017, Bren Lukens released a statement saying that they would not be joining the band on their upcoming Europe/UK tour, instead opting to stay at home to focus on their mental and physical well-being. In February 2017 the band announced that they would be cancelling their US tour and taking a break to help protect their mental health and friendships.\nThe group played no shows in the spring of 2017, during which time Ewald and Farmer worked on producing Ewald's project Slaughter Beach, Dog, and Lukens and Huber worked on solo material. When interviewed in June 2017, Ewald remarked, \"let's not call it a breakup and make a huge deal about it and have a 'Last Show Ever' or anything like that. Let's just take it easy for now, and if we wake up an[d] want to do it again, then let's do it.\" A few shows followed; in July 2017, Modern Baseball played a one-off show with Daniel Johnston as part of his final US tour, and in October 2017, the band played three consecutive shows in their hometown of Philadelphia. In an October 2017 interview, Ewald confirmed that the band had no plans to play any more shows for the indefinite future.\nMusical style.\nThe band's debut album \"Sports\" has been described as indie emo, folk punk, pop and pop punk. \"You're Gonna Miss It All\" has also been described as emo, folk rock, indie folk, indie rock, pop punk, power pop, and rock. \"Holy Ghost\" was described as emo and indie rock."

The race comprised 100 laps of a 3.180km circuit, for a total race distance of 318.0km.\nThe Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR) had announced on 12 October 1932 that a new Grand Prix formula will go into effect for the 1934 season, and the 1934 Monaco Grand Prix was the first Grand Épreuve event run under the new regulations. Although one of the new rules required the race distance to be over 500 km, Monaco GP was permitted to be run for 100 laps or 318 km, as the time required to complete 100 laps at the slow Circuit de Monaco was comparable to 500 km at faster tracks such as Monza.\nThe race was won by Guy Moll, a newly recruited Algerian of Scuderia Ferrari, driving an Alfa Romeo Tipo B/P3. In addition to winning the first race after the enrollment to the Ferrari team, Moll (at 23 years and 10 months old) remained the youngest driver to have won a Monaco GP until Lewis Hamilton (at 23 years and 4 months) won in 2008.\nClassification.\nFastest Lap: Carlo Felice Trossi (Alfa Romeo Tipo B/P3), 2m00s"

He was an elite goaltender in his time, winning the Mann Cup Canadian Major Championship two times and being named the top goaltender in the Ontario Lacrosse Association eight times. Baker is a member of the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. He is considered a pioneer of the breakout pass.\nCareer.\nBaker first played lacrosse at the age of nine in Port Dalhousie, Ontario. After three years of playing, he helped his team win the Ontario peewee championship. The next day he and his family moved to Peterborough, Ontario. At 17, he almost died of a childhood illness.\nIn 1958, Baker signed with the Brampton ABC's of the Ontario Junior A Lacrosse League and won the Minto Cup as Canadian Junior A Champions with them that season. During his winters he played in the Ontario Hockey Association with the Hamilton Tiger Cubs (the Detroit Red Wings junior entry) for three seasons as a forward.\nBaker started off his Major/Senior A career in 1959 with Peterborough Lakers. The team went belly up after two seasons and he signed with the Brooklin Redmen instead. After five seasons in Brooklin he returned to a newly formed Peterborough club in 1966 until 1973.\nIn 1968, he and his team joined the National Lacrosse Association and turned professional for two seasons. In his second season in the league he won the NLA's professional championship.\nBaker would win two Mann Cup Canadian Major Senior A championships: 1966 and 1973 with Peterborough. He also won the 1969 NLA Championship with Peterborough at the professional level. He was named 1973 Mann Cup most valuable player and won best goaltender in the Ontario Lacrosse Association ten times.

They have won 11 World Series titles, one additional interleague championship and were co-champions (tied) in another prior to the modern World Series. Known as the Cardinals from 1900 to the present, the St. Louis franchise were also known as the Brown Stockings (1882), Browns (1883–98), and Perfectos (1899). A total of 37 players and other personnel associated with the Cardinals have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York.\nThe first former Cardinals players to be inducted into Baseball Hall of Fame were John McGraw and Cy Young in 1937, the second year of the Museum's annual balloting. Rogers Hornsby was the first to be inducted as Cardinal, which occurred in 1942. Of the 38 former Cardinals elected to the Hall of Fame, 17 have been inducted as Cardinals and nine with the Cardinals logo on their cap. The most recent individual associated with the Cardinals to be inducted is Scott Rolen, inducted in 2023; while his Hall of Fame plaque features a Cardinals logo, his biography on the Hall's official website lists the Philadelphia Phillies as his primary team.\nIn addition, two separate awards – the Ford C. Frick Award and BBWAA Career Excellence Award – while not conferring the status of enshrining their recipients as members of the Hall of Fame, honor the works of a total of six sportswriters and broadcasters in connection with their coverage of the Cardinals.

It was won by Thijs Aerts of Belgium.\nRace report.\nA long night of raining turned the track to mud and slipperiness. This was evident right at the start where about half of the pack immediately took a tumble seconds after starting. After one lap a group of ten had created a gap, among them pre-race favourites Adam Toupalik (Czech Republic) and European Champion Yannick Peeters (Belgium).\nBy the end of the second lap that group had splintered with Joris Nieuwenhuis (Netherlands and Kobe Goossens (Belgium) forming a lead group. Peeters followed on seven seconds while Toupalik had dropped further back to 24 seconds.\nAt the end of the third lap things had changed yet again. With two laps left a group of three Belgians (Goossens, Peeters and Schuermans) was in the lead, Nieuwenhuis falling a few seconds behind. In the fourth lap Schuermans fell after a downhill section, taking Goossens down with him. This gave Peeters a small lead on everyone without particularly trying. This gap was quickly bridged by another Belgian, Aerts, creating a group of two Belgians with just over one lap to go. Nieuwenhuis followed closely behind and reached the two just at the start of the last lap.\nAerts managed to escape Peeters and Nieuwenhuis showing how much power he still had left. Peeters played the team game well, not trying to bridge the gap with Nieuwenhuis in his wheel. Nieuwenhuis then slipped slightly, giving Peeters the chance to break away as well as Schuermans managing to come back to Nieuwenhuis.\nThe gaps remained: Aerts took the gold medal, Peeters silver and Schuermans managed to beat Nieuwenhuis in the sprint. Goossens completed the Belgian party by taking the fifth spot."

        "title": "2019 World Athletics Championships",
        "text": "The 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships () was the seventeenth edition of the biennial, global athletics competition organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), since renamed World Athletics. It was held between 27 September and 6 October 2019 in Doha, Qatar, at the renovated multi-purpose Khalifa International Stadium, but reduced to 21,000 available seats. 1,772 athletes from 206 teams competed in 49 athletics events over the ten-day competition, comprising 24 events each for men and women, plus a mixed relay. There were 43 track and field events, 4 racewalking events, and 2 marathon road running events. The racewalking and marathon events were held in Doha Corniche.\nIt was the first edition of the competition under its modified name, having previously been known as the World Championships in Athletics, and the last held before the IAAF assumed its new identity as World Athletics. It was also the first time the competition was in the Middle East and also the first time it ended in October. Due to the hot climate, there were no morning sessions and events were held in the late afternoon onward. Long-distance road events were scheduled to start around midnight local time. For the first time, sponsors of national teams were permitted to appear on the kit that the athletes compete in.\nSome athletes competing in Doha criticised the lack of spectators, the flat atmosphere, the heat, and the timing of events, and also questioned why Doha was awarded the championships at all; despite this, World Athletics President Sebastian Coe described the 2019 Championships as the best in history, in terms of the quality of performances produced by the athletes.\nThree world records were set, and six championships records were broken. A total of 43 nations reached the medal table, and 68 nations had an athlete with a top eight finish. Based on the IAAF scoring tables, the best male and female performers were men's shot put gold medallist Joe Kovacs, and women's long jump gold medalist Malaika Mihambo.\nOrganisation.\nHost selection.\nThree cities entered the bidding process to host the event. Assessment of the bids was carried out by the IAAF Evaluation Commission, which consisted of three IAAF Council Members (IAAF Vice President Sebastian Coe, Abby Hoffman and Katsuyuki Tanaka), three IAAF Office members (Essar Gabriel, Nick Davies and Paul Hardy), public relations staff from Dentsu (Ryo Wakabayashi) as well as marketing staff from Athletics Management &amp; Services (Nigel Swinscoe).\nBoth Doha and Eugene are hosts of IAAF Diamond League meetings. Doha had previously applied for and failed to win the bid for the 2017 World Championships in Athletics, and had hosted the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family, led the Doha bid. The bid was part of a movement among the leaders of Qatar to make the country a destination for international sports tourism, within the framework of the Qatar National Vision 2030, which included the hosting of global sports events, such as the 2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m), 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and a Doha bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nEugene had hosted the 2014 World Junior Championships in Athletics. Barcelona hosted the 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics and the 2010 European Athletics Championships, as well as the annual Míting Internacional d´Atletisme Ciutat de Barcelona. The final selection of the host city was carried out on 18 November 2014 in Monaco.\nBarcelona was eliminated in the first round of voting, receiving only six of the 27 votes, then Doha prevailed in the final round with fifteen votes to Eugene's twelve. The IAAF later awarded Eugene the hosting rights for the next championships, which was later moved to 2022. IAAF President said that the Doha bid would develop the country and its community through sport. José María Odriozola, the president of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation, said that the worst bid had won the vote and \"the only thing they have there is money\".\nIn 2016, the French newspaper \"Le Monde\" claimed the selection of the host would have been paid with US$3.5 million transferred between October and November 2011 according to the US tax administration, to Papa Massata Diack, the son of Lamine Diack (former president of the IAAF). In 2019 \"The Guardian\" reported documents showing an agreement to pay US$4.5 million to Sporting Age, a Singapore-based company linked to Papa Massata Diack, in order to transfer the value of World Championships ticket sales and sponsorship to Qatari officials. In 2019, the French prosecutors charged some protagonists for corruption: the head of beIN Sports Yousef Al-Obaidly, the former president of IAAF Lamine Diack, and the head of Paris Saint Germain Nasser Al-Khelaifi. A French judge opened investigations into Dentsu and Athletics Management &amp; Services in 2019, on the basis that the companies (which had been involved in the host evaluation) had played key roles in the diversion of funds to Papa Massata Diack.\nThe selection of Doha as the host city was later criticised by numerous athletes present at the championships. Marathon fifth-placer Volha Mazuronak said organisers were disrespectful to athletes to make them compete in the conditions, and 50 km walk world champion Yohann Diniz was unhappy that the road events had not been located in the air-conditioned stadium instead. Decathlon world record holder Kevin Mayer said organisers had not prioritised athletes in respect of the climate and low spectator attendance. In response to low attendances, the stadium capacity was reduced to 21,000 for the championships, with large banners covering the empty seats, yet on the third day less than half these seats were filled despite the organisers giving free tickets to migrant workers and children. In response to the issue, IAAF Chief Executive Jon Ridgeon worked with the local organisers to take attendance-boosting measures. Ridgeon suggested that sessions were organised late in the evening for European television audiences, which meant working Qataris had gone home before the last event finals had begun (around 11 pm local time). He also said the IAAF's plan had been for the championships to serve people across the Middle East, but the Qatar diplomatic crisis had blocked people from other countries in the region from attending. Three days before the competition it was reported that 50,000 tickets had been sold for the 10-day event, signalling a 90% reduction in sales compared to the 2017 World Championships in Athletics. In response, local organisers purchased tickets and distributed them for free to ensure sizeable attendances, and also ran an initiative to allow spectators to enter the stadium and fill vacant seats left by audience members who left mid-session.\nThe issue of human rights in Qatar was also raised as over 6,000 migrant labourers, some involved in construction and cleaning of the host stadium, had lodged complaints over unpaid wages against Qatari companies. IAAF President Coe responded that the championships was a way to achieve social change and \"rise above political structures\".\nVenue.\nThe decision to hold the World Athletics Championships in the Middle East presented organisational challenges due to the hot and humid climate in Doha in September and October. In previous years the World Championships had mostly qualifying competitions in morning sessions and finals mostly in afternoon sessions. Weather conditions meant that traditional arrangement was not workable and in Doha the schedule was redesigned to have a \"pre-session\" in the afternoon and a \"main session\" in the evening. The Khalifa International Stadium used an open-air conditioning system to bring the temperature of the stadium to below , which was a world first for a stadium.\nIn collaboration with Seiko, a starting blocks camera view was broadcast from the Khalifa International Stadium's Block Cams. The intimate views from the blocks were the subject of complaint by the German Athletics Association, which said its female sprinters had not been consulted on the broadcasting of the images. The IAAF agreed to only show Block Cam images of athletes immediately prior to the starting pistol and to delete video data at other times on a daily basis. Gina Lückenkemper said the technology was \"unpleasant\" as it captured close images of athletes' crotches in tight clothing. The stadium also features an advanced lighting system, which was used in the introductions of some event finals, projecting coloured lines on to the lane boundaries and the competing athlete's names moving around the 400 m track. New graphical detail of athletes' performance was provided in television coverage, including top speed of athletes in the track and jumping events, angle and release speed in the throws, and the distance of each phase of a triple jump.\nNon-stadium racewalking and marathon events were set on a looped course around the Doha Corniche – a waterfront promenade. Organisers set the start time around midnight local time for road events to avoid the hottest conditions, although the women's marathon still began at a temperature of and humidity over 70%. The IAAF and local organisers undertook preparation for the conditions by recruiting medical experts to inform their preparations, as well as increasing water and refreshments, ice baths, and medical support along the route. It sent advisory notices to all national federations in the six months before the competition with recommendations for athletes. However, postponement of the events until after the championships was deemed a last resort. The IAAF President Sebastian Coe stated his belief that the humidity was a greater challenge for runners than the temperature itself.\nThe Khalifa Stadium hosted the 2019 Asian Athletics Championships in April before the world event.\nFor training and warm-up purposes, an outdoor venue attached to the Khalifa Stadium is available for athletes in running and jumping events, while all athletes (including throwing events) have full training facilities available at the Qatar Sports Club venue near Doha Corniche. At the Aspire Zone, indoor training facilities are available for running and jumping disciplines while a separate outdoor throws training venue is also available.\nMascot.\nThe event mascot was \"Falah\", an anthropomorphic falcon dressed in athletic gear in the maroon colour of the flag of Qatar. The mascot was designed by a Filipino expatriate in Doha, Theodore Paul Manuel, and his design was announced as the winner of the design competition on Qatar's national sports day. Twenty-one sketches were submitted and a group of young Qataris were invited to vote on their favourite designs. Following this, the head of the Qatar Olympic Committee Joaan bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and members of the local organising committee narrowed the choices down to a shortlist of three for final voting.\nEntry standards.\nThe IAAF announced that athletes would qualify by their IAAF World Rankings position, wildcard (reigning world champion or 2019 IAAF Diamond League champion) or by achieving the entry standard. Following criticism that the qualification method was biased the IAAF reverted to their traditional qualifying method. The qualification period for the 10,000 metres, marathon, race walks, relays, and combined events ran from 7 March 2018 to 6 September 2019. For all other events, the qualification period runs from 7 September 2018 to 6 September 2019.\nWild Card as:\nCountries who have no male and/or no female athletes who have achieved the Entry Standard or considered as having achieved the entry standard (see above) or qualified relay team, may enter one unqualified male athlete OR one unqualified female athlete in one event of the championships (except the road events and field events, combined events, 10,000 m and 3000 m steeplechase).\nTarget numbers.\nAt the end of the qualification period, the 2019 IAAF World Rankings published on 6 September 2019 were used to invite additional athletes to the World Championships where the target number of athletes had not been achieved for that event through other methods of qualification. The maximum of three athletes per country in individual events is not affected by this rule. National athletics associations retained the right to confirm or reject athlete selections through this method. Where the highest ranked athletes were from a country that had already had three or more entrants for the event, or where the national association rejected an entrant, the next highest ranked athlete became eligible for entry via world rankings.\nEvent summaries.\nSprints.\nIn the men's 100 metres, the semi-finals were dominated by world leader Christian Coleman from the United States, finishing in 9.88 seconds while no other qualifiers broke 10 seconds. In the final, defending champion American Justin Gatlin got a good start to gain a step on the field, except Coleman got a better start, gaining that step on Gatlin and extending his lead to a dominating victory in 9.76 seconds, a new personal best and world-leading time for the season that becomes the 6th best in history, just 2 ticks behind Gatlin's best. Returning to form, Canada's Andre De Grasse closed and nearly caught Gatlin at the line in 9.90, a new wind-legal personal best, though he has run as fast as 9.69 wind-aided.\nLong distance.\nThe women's marathon began at midnight local time on 28 September with the temperature at and 70 per cent humidity. By the end of the race, 28 of the 68 starters had dropped out, including all three Ethiopian runners. Five runners in a lead pack stayed together for the first and the pack was down to only four athletes by , including Ruth Chepngetich and Edna Kiplagat of Kenya, Bahrain's Rose Chelimo and Namibia's Helalia Johannes. Chepngetich broke out into a sprint in the final lap to finish at 2:32:43, followed by Chelimo (2:33:46) and Johannes (2:35:15).\nThe women's 10,000 metres began the following night with Germany's Alina Reh taking an early lead before falling back and eventually dropping out. By the ninth lap, a lead pack of three Kenyans and three Ethiopians developed. By the half-way point, the Netherlands' Sifan Hassan had latched on to back of the lead pack, headed by Kenya's Rosemary Wanjiru and Agnes Tirop. Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia surged with four laps remaining with Hassan following close behind. Hassan took the lead on the final lap and finished in 30:17.33, more than three seconds ahead of Gidey, and almost eight seconds ahead of Tirop in third place.\nHurdles.\nIn the men's 400 m hurdles, most of the top ranked athletes reached the final, though world number 4 Ludvy Vaillant was eliminated.\nJumps.\nThe last place qualifier to the men's long jump final was Jamaica's Tajay Gayle with . In the final on 28 September, Gayle jumped a personal best to take the lead in the first round. No other jumper would beat that mark. World leader Juan Miguel Echevarría from Cuba jumped while giving up the entire width of the board. His jump was bettered by American Jeff Henderson with an three jumpers later. In the third round, Echevarría improved to and Henderson responded again with , which ultimately settled the medal positions. In the fourth round, Gayle improved his winning jump to .\nThrows.\nIn the men's shot put, 4 men surpassed the previous Championship Record, with 22.53, a distance surpassing any winning mark in any global championship to this time, only falling in 4th. Joe Kovacs won with 22.91, silver went to Ryan Crouser with 22.90(22.71), and Tom Walsh took bronze with 22.90(22.56).With world record holder and defending champion Anita Włodarczyk absent from the women's hammer throw due to injury, world leader DeAnna Price seized the opportunity on the second throw of the competition with , then a best of in the third round – no athlete could match her. The next thrower into the ring was Włodarczyk's Polish teammate Joanna Fiodorow, who threw her personal best to win the silver medal and drop Zalina Petrivskaya's first throw of the competition to third place after the first three throwers. Although Petrivskaya threw in the third round and maintained that position, China's Wang Zheng threw the hammer to to grab the bronze medal in the middle of the fifth round.\nWalks.\nThe men's 50 kilometres walk started at midnight local time on 29 September. Most walkers were wary of starting too fast; only the 20K world record holder, Japan's Yusuke Suzuki, went out fast, opening up a gap just a few minutes into the race. By 5K he had a 10-second lead over a chase pack and by 20K he had expanded the lead to two minutes. Suzuki crossed the halfway point at 2:01:07 and, by 35K, Suzuki had opened his lead up to 3:34. Suzuki first showed signs of cracking, stopping at the water station at 44K before getting back on stride. At that point he still had two minutes on China's Niu Wenbin, an additional minute on Portugal's João Vieira, with the next chaser Canada's Evan Dunfee another minute back, now ahead of China's Luo Yadong. Suzuki struggled through the final lap while Vieira and Dunfee were applying the pressure. Both passed Niu, with Dunfee closing down his gap to Vieira. Suzuki got across the finish line first, only 39 seconds ahead of Vieira, who held off Dunfee by only three seconds.\nIn its second appearance since the event's debut in 2017, the women's 50 kilometres walk began simultaneously with the men's. A lead quartet of China's Liang Rui and Li Maocuo with Italy's Eleonora Giorgi and Portugal's Inês Henriques crossed the 10K mark together, before Giorgi and Henriques dropped back. Liang continued to expand her lead with Li following comfortably ahead of Giorgi as the athletes reached 40K mark. Liang won the race in 4:23:26, more than three minutes ahead of her teammate Li, to become the first Chinese athlete to win the world title at that distance. Giorgi finished almost four minutes behind Li to win bronze.\nDaily highlights.\nDay one to three.\nOne final was contested on the first day: Kenyan Ruth Chepngetich won the women's marathon in 2:32:43, beating the defending champion Rose Chelimo of Bahrain in the first ever World Championships race to start at midnight. Braima Sundar Dabo of Guinea Bissau won plaudits for assisting competitor Jonathan Busby of Aruba to the finish of the men's 5000 m heats. A record 17 athletes qualified for the women's pole vault final. Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría's jump of was the best performance in men's long jump qualifying for ten years. Christian Coleman had the first sub-10 run of the championships in the men's 100 metres heats. \"Athletics Weekly\" noted the lack of spectators on the first day and the difficultly in travelling to the stadium, while decathlon World Champion Kevin Mayer was highly critical: \"it's a disaster, there is no-one in the stands and the heat has not been adapted at all...We haven't really prioritised athletes when organising the championships here\".\nThere were six finals on the second day of competition. DeAnna Price became the first American to win the women's hammer throw while Tajay Gayle became Jamaica's first men's long jump world champion, surprising the field by adding 37 centimetres to his personal best and improving to tenth on the all-time lists. Sifan Hassan broke the African dominance of the women's 10,000 metres that stretched back to 1997, by taking gold for the Netherlands. America's Christian Coleman won the men's 100 metres final in a time of 9.76 seconds. The qualifiers for the mixed 4 × 400 m relay resulted in the first world record of the championships, with the American quartet finishing in 3:12.42 minutes. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce ran the fastest time ever recorded in the heats stage of the women's 100 metres with 10.80 seconds.\nOn the third day, five finals were scheduled. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won her fourth world title in the women's 100 m, recording her second fastest time ever (10.71) to hold off the British record-breaking Dina Asher-Smith. In the, Christian Taylor also won a fourth title in the men's triple jump, with compatriot Will Claye finishing runner-up as he had in 2017, and Hugues Fabrice Zango winning Burkina Faso's first ever World Championships medal in third. The mixed 4 × 400 m relay final brought another world record (3:09.34) and a twelfth gold medal for Allyson Felix, taking her ahead of Usain Bolt on the all-time medal tally. Poland drew interest in the mixed relay for its choice to place men on the two middle legs – the opposite of all the other teams. Anzhelika Sidorova won her first world title in the women's pole vault final, competing as an Authorised Neutral Athlete. Liu Hong was the last winner of the day, taking her third World Championships gold in the women's 20 km walk, where Qieyang Shenjie and Yang Liujing helped make it a medal sweep for the Chinese team. Liu, Felix and Fraser-Pryce all returned victorious to the World Championships after having had children in the previous two years, and in her post-race interview Fraser-Pryce said she hoped to inspire other women to start families and return to elite sport.\nDay four to six.\nDay four featured six gold medal events. In men's discus throw Daniel Ståhl won Sweden's first gold medal in the event, while runner-up Fedrick Dacres won Jamaica's first discus medal and Lukas Weisshaidinger became Austria's first male World Championships medallist. Mariya Lasitskene defended her title in the women's high jump, winning on countback ahead of Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who set a world under-20 record of . Sprint finishes from Muktar Edris and Selemon Barega made it an Ethiopian 1–2 in the men's 5000 metres final, where the early leader Jakob Ingebrigtsen collapsed over the line and missed a medal. Beatrice Chepkoech was dominant in the women's steeplechase, establishing a significant lead on her way to a championships record of 8:57.84 minutes. In her first global final, Halimah Nakaayi surprised with a Ugandan national record of 1:58.04 minutes to win the women's 800 metres. Karsten Warholm kept the men's 400 m hurdles final to the form book by retaining his world title, while Abderrahman Samba's bronze medal added the host nation Qatar to the medal table.\nOn the fifth day, the United States team won three of the four finals. Donavan Brazier broke records that had lasted over 30 years in the men's 800 metres final with a championship record and American record of 1:42.34 minutes. Silver medallist Amel Tuka gave Bosnia and Herzegovina's best ever performance of the championships. Noah Lyles had a clear victory in the men's 200 metres final. Sam Kendricks won the men's pole vault on countback in a closely fought final – the medallists Kendricks, Armand Duplantis and Piotr Lisek celebrated together on the landing mat with a synchronised backflip. The fourth gold medallist of the evening was Australia's Kelsey-Lee Barber, who surprised China's Liu Shiying and Lü Huihui by moving up from fourth to first place with her final throw of the competition. In qualifying Amalie Iuel set a Norwegian record as the second fastest qualifier in the women's 400 m hurdles, while Abdalelah Haroun of the host nation Qatar exited the men's 400 m in the first round.\nThere were three finals on the sixth day. Poland's Paweł Fajdek won a record fourth straight title in the men's hammer throw final, and officials played a role in the minor medals – fourth-placer Wojciech Nowicki was also awarded a bronze medal as irregularities with Bence Halász's bronze medal-winning throw was adjudged to have disadvantaged Nowicki, while Great Britain was unsuccessful in its appeal over Nick Miller's second round throw, which looked to be good enough for a silver medal but was judged a foul. In his international debut, Grant Holloway won the gold medal in the men's 110 metres hurdles final, where defending champion Omar McLeod collapsed after hitting several hurdles. McLeod crashed into Orlando Ortega impeding the Spaniard and although the Spanish team's appeal to have the race re-run was rejected, Ortega was instead awarded an additional bronze medal. Dina Asher-Smith won the women's 200 metres final by a large margin, becoming Britain's first global champion in the women's sprints with a British record time. In the first day of combined events, thirty points separated the top three in the men's decathlon (Damian Warner, Pierce LePage and Kevin Mayer) while in the women's heptathlon Katarina Johnson-Thompson set the fourth best ever day one score for a 96-point lead over defending champion Nafissatou Thiam.\nDay seven to ten.\nThe four finals of the seventh day centred around the conclusion of the combined events. Katarina Johnson-Thompson defeated Nafi Thiam in the heptathlon with a British record score of 6981 points, which moved her up to sixth on the all-time lists. The second day of the decathlon brought surprises as world record holder Kevin Mayer dropped out and Germany's Niklas Kaul set a championship decathlon best in the javelin to help him surge from eleventh place to the gold medal, making him the youngest winner of the title at age 21. The women's 400 metres final was among the fastest ever with five women under 50 seconds for the first time at the championships – 21-year-old Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain seized the lead early on and crossed the line in 48.14 seconds for the third fastest time ever, leaving the Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo in second place with 48.37 seconds (becoming the sixth fastest athlete ever). China's Gong Lijiao defended her women's shot put title, reaching the podium for a sixth straight championships, while silver medallist Danniel Thomas-Dodd made history as Jamaica's first woman to win a global medal in the throws.\nAmong the six finals of the eighth day, the men's high jump final helped fill out the stadium for the first time as Qatari Mutaz Essa Barshim won a high quality contest for the host nation. Barshim, Mikhail Akimenko and Ilya Ivanyuk all cleared before the home athlete topped to win his country's first gold of the event. In the women's 400 metres hurdles final, Americans Dalilah Muhammad and Sydney McLaughlin turned the race into a duel which resulted in Olympic champion Muhammad setting a world record of 52.16 seconds to hold off 20-year-old McLaughlin, who ran the third fastest time ever. Ethiopian Lamecha Girma attempted to break Kenya's winning streak in the men's steeplechase final but was edged out on the line by Kenya's defending champion Conseslus Kipruto, with one hundredth of a second separating the two. Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas had a dominant run to win the men's 400 metres final, finishing over half a second ahead of the field and setting a Bahamian record of 43.48 seconds. Gardiner's presence was only possible due to a public fund-raising campaign for his national team, as Hurricane Dorian had devastated the Caribbean nation just one month earlier. The women's discus final was a Cuban affair between Yaime Pérez and Denia Caballero, with Pérez ultimately winning the gold with a fifth round effort of . The first round of the men's and women's 4 × 100 metres relay saw athletes run an African record, a South American record and three national records. Toshikazu Yamanishi took the gold medal in the men's 20 km walk in the overnight session.\nSix finals were scheduled for the ninth day. The men's shot put final saw four men surpass the previous championships record. Only one centimetre separated medallists Tom Walsh, Ryan Crouser, and Joe Kovacs, with Kovacs getting the win in – the best performance in nearly three decades. Yulimar Rojas was dominant in the women's triple jump final, taking the gold medal with a mark of – the fourth best jump ever. Sifan Hassan became the first woman to achieve a 1500/10,000 m double at the championships, and her winning time of 3:51.95 minutes was a championship and European record. Hassan gave an emotional post-race interview, defending herself against doping accusations which had arisen due to the four-year doping ban of her coach Alberto Salazar in the previous days. Hellen Obiri defended her title in the women's 5000 metres final and ran a championship record of 14:26.72 minutes in order to do so. The men's 4 × 100 metres relay final brought a slew of records with the United States winning with a national record time of 37.10 seconds (the third fastest ever) and Great Britain, Japan and Brazil setting continental area records for the next three places. Lelisa Desisa and Mosinet Geremew made it a 1–2 for Ethiopia in the late-night men's marathon, held in easier weather conditions than the women's race.\nOn the tenth and final day of the championships, seven finals were held. Malaika Mihambo of Germany won a clear gold in the women's long jump final by producing the twelfth best ever performance of . In the men's 1500 metres final Kenya's Timothy Cheruiyot set a quick pace and surged at the end to take the gold medal. Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda held off Yomif Kejelcha in the men's 10,000 metres final to claim his second world of the year, having already topped the 2019 IAAF World Cross Country Championships podium. Anderson Peters of Grenada upset a field of more decorated European athletes in the men's javelin throw final as no one bettered his opening throw of , while silver medallist Magnus Kirt of Estonia injured himself in the effort to beat his rival. Nia Ali of the United States surprised in the women's 100 metres hurdles final by winning gold in 12.34 seconds, making herself the ninth fastest of all-time and pushing the more favoured Danielle Williams and Kendra Harrison into the minor medals. The championships was brought to a close with the men's and women's 4 × 400 metres relay finals. The United States won both in world leading times to finish as the medal leader – its haul of 29 medals and 14 gold medals was almost three times that of second-placed Kenya (five golds and eleven medals). Jamaica ranked third on the medal table with three golds and twelve medals – its final bronze coming from the women's 4 × 400 metres relay after a successful appeal against an initial disqualification.\nStatistics.\nMedal table.\n IAAF does not include the medals won by athletes competing as Authorised Neutral Athletes in their official medal table.\nPlacing table.\nThe Placing table assigns points to the top eight athletes in the final, with eight points to first place, seven to second place, and so on until one point for eighth place. Teams or athletes that do not finish or are disqualified do not receive points.\nRecords.\nAt the 2019 World Athletics Championships, three world records, one world under-20 record, six championships records, 21 area records and 86 national records in athletics were set. Furthermore, two championship combined event bests were set and 23 world-leading performances (WL) were achieved at the competition.\nAllyson Felix became the most decorated athlete in World Championships, reaching a career total of 13 gold medals through wins in the women's and the mixed 4 × 400 metres relays.\nParticipants.\n205 out of the 214 member federations of the IAAF participated in the Championships, as well as an Athlete Refugee Team, for a total of 1,772 athletes out of 1,972 originally entered. Due to the IAAF suspension of the Russian Athletics Federation, confirmed on 23 September by the IAAF Council, Russian athletes competed as Authorised Neutral Athletes. A total of 101 federations entered one athlete only (25 of those athletes were women). IAAF members Libya, Liechtenstein, Montserrat, Norfolk Island, and Tuvalu did not enter any athletes, while the Central African Republic, Dominica, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates originally entered athletes but those did not start for various reasons.\nThe gender split between the preliminary entrants was 53% male and 47% female, and IAAF President Sebastian Coe noted after a meeting with the executive board of the International Olympic Committee that the organisation was looking to extend gender equality to its governing structures also.\nAbsences.\nSeveral prominent athletes were absent from the competition. The reigning women's 100 metres hurdles world champion Sally Pearson announced her retirement one month before the championships. Several reigning world champions could not attempt to defend their global titles due to injury, including Anita Włodarczyk (women's hammer throw), Wayde van Niekerk (men's 400 m), Ivana Španović (women's long jump), Elijah Manangoi (men's 1500 m), and Éider Arévalo (men's 20 km walk).\nAmong other high-profile injury withdrawals were women's 1500 m world record holder Genzebe Dibaba, 10,000 m world record holder Almaz Ayana, two-time shot put world champion David Storl, Olympic women's pole vault medallist Eliza McCartney, 2017 world sprint hurdles medallist Pamela Dutkiewicz, world champion in the relay Chijindu Ujah, world decathlon runner-up Rico Freimuth, and former European champions Arthur Abele, Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad, Timur Morgunov, and Morhad Amdouni. World medallist Eilidh Doyle was absent due to pregnancy.\nThe following athletes were also absent due to injury:\nTestosterone rule.\nThe three 2016 Olympic medallists in the women's 800 metres were all excluded from the 2019 World Athletics Championships under the IAAF's testosterone rules. Caster Semenya, Francine Niyonsaba and Margaret Wambui all acknowledged they had a difference in sex development (DSD) which resulted in their bodies producing levels of testosterone above the limits set by the IAAF for women's competition. The IAAF rules stipulate such athletes must take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete in women's races. Caster Semenya's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against this rule was ongoing at the time of the World Championships. All three athletes declined to adhere to the IAAF's ruling and thus could not compete. CAS had previously made a decision in May 2019 to uphold the IAAF's rules on the grounds that they were discriminatory to athletes with a DSD, but that discriminatory action was \"a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the legitimate objective of ensuring fair competition in female athletics\". Kenyan athletes, 800 m national champion Jackline Wambui and Linda Kageha, who was in the mixed relay team, were excluded from selection for Kenya as they refused to submit to a testosterone test. Because of the testosterone rule, 400 metres world No. 3 Aminatou Seyni competed in the women's 200 metres instead of women's 400 metres.\nAnti-doping.\nWorking alongside the Local Organising Committee and the Qatar Anti-Doping Commission, the IAAF's Athletics Integrity Unit oversaw an anti-doping programme at the World Championships for the second time, having been created two years earlier. The 2019 World Championships was the first in which national federations were obligated to ensure all athletes they selected had been subject to three out-of-competition tests and one in-competition test prior to the competition. This rule resulted in the exclusion of two Kenyan runners, Michael Kibet and Daniel Simiyu, who had not failed a test but had not been tested sufficiently before Doha. At the host venue, around 700 athletes' blood samples were collected as part of the biological passport scheme designed to identify the use of steroids, EPO or human growth hormone. A further 500 in-competition tests are due to take place, mostly urine-based. Samples taken at the World Championships will be transferred to a World Anti-Doping Agency-accredited laboratory outside of the host country, in order to remove conflicts of interest that had affected prior events. In collaboration with the IAAF Athletes' Commission, an athlete education and support site was set up in Doha: the Athletics Integrity Hub. The hub provided information on anti-doping and also support for reporting of illegal gambling, bribery and corruption, harassment and abuse.\nThe Russian Athletics Federation was excluded from the World Championships for a second time running as it remained suspended by the IAAF due to systemic doping. The Russian Federation had failed to gain reinstatement that year because tests from the Russian Anti-Doping Agency's Moscow laboratory indicated evidence of manipulation. Russian athletes had to apply to the IAAF to compete under the Authorised Neutral Athlete scheme. Although not nationally suspended, Kenya came under scrutiny for a culture of doping, with Brett Clothier of the Athletics Integrity Unit stating that \"EPO is readily available and everyone knows where to get it and how to use it\" in a documentary released by German broadcaster ZDF shortly before the World Championships.\nThe world leader in the men's 100 metres, Christian Coleman, was suspended by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after missing three out-of-competition tests within a 12-month period, but successfully appealed a ban on a technicality of the test dates and gained entry to the competition. During the championships, the USADA issued a four-year ban for doping violations to Alberto Salazar, head coach of the Nike Oregon Project – a training group that included several athletes who would go on to medal at the championships.\nDilshod Nazarov, the reigning Olympic champion in the men's hammer throw and also president of the Tajikistan Athletics Federation, was banned shortly before the competition, after retesting of a sample from the 2011 World Championships in Athletics showed metabolites of Turinabol. Other athletes suspended on anti-doping grounds shortly before the championships were the 2015 women's 800 m world champion Maryna Arzamasova, 2019 Pan American Games women's discus silver medallist Andressa de Morais, the 2018 Commonwealth Games women's 100 m champion Michelle-Lee Ahye, African sprint medallist Carina Horn and Asian long-distance medallist Albert Rop.\nDue to the re-analysis of samples taken from previous championships, 13 current and former athletes received their world championship medals during the championships. Marija Šestak received her triple jump bronze medal from the 2007 World Championships. Oleksiy Kasyanov, Antonietta Di Martino and Naide Gomes received their bronze medals from the 2009 World Championships. Habiba Ghribi received her 3000-meter steeplechase gold medal from the 2011 World Championships. Race walkers Jared Tallent and Kim Hyun-sub collected their silver and bronze medals respectively, whilst the 2019 world champion Gong Lijiao received her shot put bronze medal and javelin thrower Sunette Viljoen received her silver medal. 800 meter runners Janeth Jepkosgei and Alysia Montaño collected their silver and bronze medals. Montano also collected her bronze medal from the 2013 World Championships as her teammate Brenda Martinez collected the silver. Hammer thrower Anita Włodarczyk also collected her gold medal from the 2013 championships.\nMedia coverage.\nThe IAAF agreed broadcasting agreements with 160 territories, with remaining areas receiving coverage direct from the IAAF via the organisation's official YouTube channel."

        "text": "The Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) is a women's basketball league in England, covering semi-professional and amateur levels of the game. This is effectively seen as the second tier of women's basketball in the United Kingdom, along with the less celebrated Scottish Women's National League.\nThe EBL was established in 2003 by Basketball England to replace the former National Basketball League, which the league has since reverted to at the start of the 2015/2016 season, and currently operates three women's leagues in a regionalised structure, as well as the men's National Basketball League. The senior leagues are supported by a junior structure for both male and female players, with leagues for under-18s, under-16s and under-14s.\nThe NBL Leagues form the second and third level of women's competition in the United Kingdom, with the highest level consisting of the semi-professional Women's British Basketball League. There is no promotion and relegation between the National League and the Women's British Basketball League, which operates a franchise system, although teams seeking greater competition and exposure can apply to make the step from NBL to the WBBL.\nHistory.\nWhen it was founded in 2003, the women's EBL consisted of two levels of competition; a nationalized Division 1, closely matching the WNBL Conference which existed under the previous structure, and a regionalized Division 2, originally split into North and South conferences. At this point, there was no level of competition above Division 1, nor any competition for clubs on a British level. From the 2007/2008 season onwards, Division 2 was split into three regions to allow for the greater number of clubs applying for national competition.\nIn 2014, England Basketball and the British Basketball League collaborated to form the Women's British Basketball League, which absorbed many of the largest women's clubs in the NBL, including the whole of Division 1. As a result, the most established and successful clubs in women's basketball in the United Kingdom are no longer part of the NBL. Initially, the NBL's women's leagues retained the original regionalised structure of the old Division 2, which meant only the end-of-season playoffs offering the opportunity for clubs from across the whole of England to compete against each other. A nationalised Division 1 was reinstated for the 2016/2017 season, with the new Division 2 split across a North/South divide.\nTeams.\nWNBL Division 1 League for the 2020/2021 season.\nDivision 1.\nWNBL Division 2 League for the 2020/2021 Season."

However, following negotiations with the organising authorities, a compromise was reached whereby, in 2015, these events were for junior swimmers only - in effect, under 18 for men, under 16 for women.\nIn effect, therefore, the swimming portion of the 2015 European Games doubled as the 2015 European Junior Swimming Championships.\nProgramme.\nA number of non-Olympic distances will be raced, in addition to a full Olympic programme. The 50 metre sprint in backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly will be held for both genders, the 800 metre freestyle for men, the 1500 metre freestyle for women and mixed gender 4 x 100 metre relays, both freestyle and medley.\nQualification.\nFollowing the European Junior Swimming Championships in July 2014, (Dordrecht, Netherlands), LEN will confirm the quotas per NOC and discipline based on an average ranking by NOC from the last three European Junior Swimming Championships."

The events took place at the Nanjing Olympic Sports Center and Laoshan National Forest Park in Nanjing, China.\nFormat.\nFor the Youth Olympics, athletes competed in teams instead of competing separately. In the boys' and girls' team event, two athletes compete together. Each of the two riders must compete in two of the following events, with only one team member competing per event: BMX, Mountain Bike Cross-country Race, Mountain Bike Cross-country Eliminator and Road Time Trial. Both members will also have to compete in the Road Race event.\nFor the mixed team relay, two boys and two girls formed a team. The event was composed of a Mountain Bike Cross-country Race, performed by one boy and one girl and a Road Race, performed by the other two team members. For NOCs who qualified, only two men or women lots will be drawn to form combined teams.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter a maximum of two teams of two athletes, one per each gender. As hosts, China was given the maximum quota, but only elected to send a female team and a further six teams. Three teams in each gender was initially given to the Tripartite Commission, but only three spots were given. The other spots were reallocated. The remaining 28 teams were decided by rankings from the 2013 Junior Mountain Bike World Championships, 2013 Junior BMX World Championships, 2013 Women's Junior Road World Championships and 2013 Men's Junior Road Nations Cup (events between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014 are considered).\nAfter the rankings were published, teams qualified based on the following criteria until 28 teams were listed.

        "title": "Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show occurred on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey as part of Super Bowl XLVIII and was headlined by Bruno Mars alongside his band The Hooligans, with special guests The Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the time of airing the halftime show attracted the largest audience in the history of the Super Bowl, attracting 115.3 million viewers, later surpassed by the Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl 50, and Super Bowl LI halftime shows.\nThe show was produced by Ricky Kirshner and directed by Hamish Hamilton, receiving two 2014 Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program and Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special. The performance generated 2.2 million tweets, due to interest for tickets to Mars' Moonshine Jungle Tour.\nBackground.\nBruno Mars was confirmed as the lead half time performer for Super Bowl XLVIII in September 2013 during a Fox NFL Sunday broadcast held live in Times Square in New York City. The NFL's entertainment team started working with Mars and his management on the halftime set list around Thanksgiving week and spent the remainder of 2013 mapping out the production and staging, along with the guest list. In January 2014 it was announced that Mars had personally invited Red Hot Chili Peppers to perform as special guests during his performance. On January 24, 2014, during the game's fourth quarter, Hyundai debuted the spot entitled \"Dad's Sixth Sense\", that featured the 2016 Hyundai Genesis and Mars' single \"Count on Me\". The song was chosen \"for reasons separate and coincidental from Mars' previously announced Half Time gig\".\nDuring rehearsals there were some disagreements between Mars and the NFL, regarding the singer's performance. The latter wanted to show the audience wearing light-up bracelets to which Mars concurred \"If you take that camera off me, you're doing yourself a disservice. And what happened? They spent all this money on these things, and it didn't work.\" Fortunately, Mars and his band rehearsed a lot and it didn't matter if they had \"cafeteria lighting\" or a budget of $5 million (U.S.), the performance would always be the best they could do. According to the singer, \"Every smoke machine and laser light is just a bonus.\"\nDevelopment.\nThe halftime show was produced by Ricky Kirshner and directed by Hamish Hamilton. Mars and his eight-piece band, The Hooligans, were dressed in clothes custom created by Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane. Prince, Michael Jackson and James Brown used the same style in clothes; Mars worked a retro gold lame jacket paired with a white shirt, black trousers and a matching skinny tie. Mars made history at the Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show as the youngest artist ever to serve as the sole NFL Super Bowl Halftime headliner. He opened the show with a drum solo on a kit designed to honor his late mother, Bernadette Hernandez. The artwork was modeled after Mars' arm tattoo dedicated to his mother. During his performance of \"Just the Way You Are\" he was standing midfield, backed by the biggest firework display in NFL Super Bowl history.\nMontreal-based firm PixMob provided audience lighting effects during the show: \"video ski hats\" with LEDs and an infrared receiver were distributed to attendees of the game. Lighting cues were sent to the hats using infrared signals from around the stadium, transforming the audience into \"pixels\" of a giant \"screen\".\nStarting with this halftime show, the halftime show logo does not appear in the introduction. As well, the opening was changed to \"The National Football League welcomes you to the (sponsor) Super Bowl (Numeral) Halftime Show\".\nSetlist.\nSet list adapted from \"Billboard\".\nReception.\nCritical.\nMars' performance received highly positive reviews from critics, while the Red Hot Chili Peppers' appearance received mixed to negative reviews. Mike Bruno of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave a positive review of the halftime performance, complimenting Mars' \"impressive\" vocal performance and stating that \"there's no question the kid is talented\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" also criticized the Red Hot Chili Peppers' involvement in the performance, stating that there was \"nothing wrong\" with their performance however that their presence was \"random and unnecessary\". Matthew Perpetua of \"BuzzFeed\" called Mars a \"world class entertainer\" and stated that Mars' performance was \"dazzling\" and \"pretty awesome\". However, Perpetua also stated that the Chili Peppers' presence was \"unnecessary\" and also noted that the halftime show was not as memorable as the previous year's show, which was performed by Beyoncé. Lindsey Weber of \"Vulture\" stated it was unfair to compare Mars' performance to Beyoncé's and that the performance was \"perfectly Bruno\"; however, Weber also said that it was unlikely that people would \"still be talking about\" the performance the day after. Mikael Wood of \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that Mars \"delivered\" during the performance and showed viewers that he is a \"real musician\" however felt that the performance did not begin to feel \"hopelessly retro\" compared to Beyoncé's performance until the Chili Peppers joined Mars. Wood felt that the Chili Peppers' performance was \"stale\" and unwanted and stated that Mars did not need any guests to make the performance special.\nChris Chase and Chris Strauss of \"USA Today\" gave a mixed review of the show, saying it was \"unspectacular\" and \"instantly forgettable\" and felt that Mars' youth and unlengthy repertoire failed to give him the legacy of previous halftime performers. Chase and Strauss stated the performance was \"acceptable\" however that it would not be remembered.\nRed Hot Chili Peppers controversy.\nSome complaints, including some from fellow musicians, were directed towards Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer who appeared to not have wires connected to their instruments and were accused of faking their performance. A few days following the Super Bowl, Flea responded through the band's website by saying:\nChili Peppers drummer Chad Smith also responded to the controversy through his Twitter page saying: \"FYI... Every band in the last 10 years at the Super Bowl has performed to a previously recorded track. It's the NFL's policy. Period.\"\nSome fans even complained to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about the band's shirtless appearance saying that they were offended and both men and women should wear clothing because children were watching. One person even contacted the FCC complaining sexism and how it was unfair for the Chili Peppers to go topless but Janet Jackson's exposed nipple caused so much backlash.\nRatings.\nThe Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show was once the most watched in the history of the Super Bowl drawing record ratings of 115.3 million viewers, passing the record 114 million who watched Madonna perform two years earlier. This was surpassed by Katy Perry in 2015, Coldplay in 2016, and Lady Gaga in 2017. However, that number was significantly higher than the 98.88 million viewers reported in the overnight ratings from Nielsen that measure the top 56 markets.\nMedia.\nOn February 3, 2014 \"Billboard\" predicted that retailers had sold \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" 40,000 copies in the week ending February 2, representing a 164% gain compared to the previous week, when it sold 15,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Despite this effect, the album was already aiming for around 19,000 copies sold in the week ending February 2, thanks in part to Mars' exposure at the 2014 Grammy Awards. Mars was presented the award for Best Pop Vocal Album on the Grammys and got additional screen time from his nominations in other categories as Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The author of the article added that \"the impact of the Super Bowl on Mars' music sales, and on the Billboard charts, will be unique compared to all other halftime headliners in the modern era of Super Bowl halftime entertainment\". On the following week it was expect that \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" would sell 70,000 to 80,000 copies by the end of the tracking week, coming for the top three on next week's \"Billboard\" 200 chart, while his debut album, \"Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans\", was expected sell around 25,000 copies.\nRegarding the tickets sales of his worldwide tour, The Moonshine Jungle Tour, Mars became the fastest entertainer to sell out three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena, in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, the average price for The Moonshine Jungle Tour went up $150 to an average price of $500. Despite existence of some tickets left on the primary market for select shows, many were sold out. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranges from $49–$100 for most shows. Bigger city shows prices range from $70 to $181. For shows at big venues, the average prices on the secondary market is north of $600 with the cheapest tickets going for $150. At these prices, Mars upcoming tour ranks amongst the most expensive in the country this summer, ahead of One Direction tickets and Jason Aldean tickets, which were two of the highest prices for an American tour during the spring and summer of 2014."

He was drafted by the Miami Marlins with the second overall pick of the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft.\nHigh school career.\nKolek attended Shepherd High School in Shepherd, Texas, and played for the school's baseball team. He missed most of his junior season, after breaking his arm in a collision with a baserunner. He signed a letter-of-intent with Texas Christian University in November 2013. Throughout the first three starts of his senior year, he had not given up a hit and had 35 strikeouts over 15 innings.\nProfessional career.\nWith a fastball that had been clocked as high as , Kolek was considered to be among the top high school pitching prospects for the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft. The Miami Marlins selected Kolek in the first round, second overall, of the draft. He signed on June 16 and was assigned to the GCL Marlins, where he posted a 0-3 record with a 4.50 ERA in nine games. He spent 2015 with the Greensboro Grasshoppers where he went 4-10 with a 4.56 ERA, with a 1.56 WHIP in 25 games. On April 7, 2016, Kolek underwent Tommy John surgery, and had to sit out during the 2016 season. Kolek missed a majority of the 2017 season as well due to injury; he pitched in only three games for the GCL Marlins in which he gave up 12 earned runs in 3.2 innings.\nKolek spent the 2018 season split between the Low-A Batavia Muckdogs and the GCL Marlins, where he pitched to a 6.32 ERA in 10 appearances for the clubs. He split 2019 between the Single-A Clinton LumberKings and Batavia, registering a 9.22 ERA in 15 games. Kolek did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 2, 2020, Kolek elected free agency.\nBeing inactive in 2021 and having failed to advance past A ball which is three levels below the major leagues, he will become the fifth player to be drafted #2 overall in the first year player draft, and the first since 1987, to fail to reach the major leagues before retiring should he not resume his baseball career. In addition, the #1 overall pick Brady Aiken was also inactive in 2021, and also having failed to advance past A level baseball. This will mark the first major league baseball draft in which both the first and second overall selections failed to reach the major leagues.\nPersonal life.\nKolek's brother, Stephen, also played for Shepherd's baseball team, and played college baseball for Texas A&amp;M University. He was drafted in the 11th round of the 2018 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, and is currently a pitcher for the San Diego Padres."

Since becoming conference foes, the game is played typically twice per season. The Wildcats and Bruins have faced off 10 times in conference tournament games.\nBefore the arrival of Lute Olson at Arizona, the Bruins had won 21 of 24 games against the Wildcats. UCLA had been seen as the dominant college basketball program in the west, with few teams able to challenge UCLA for the throne beyond a few wins. The rivalry did not gather steam until Lute Olson's arrival in 1984, who compiled a 28–23 record against the Bruins during his tenure as Arizona's head coach.\nSince then, the two schools competed for the Pac-10 (now Pac-12) Championship every year, with the two teams winning 23 out of the 31 conference titles, and 9 of 18 conference tournament titles. Arizona clinched their first conference title in 1986, when they won on the road at UCLA in Olson's third season. The UCLA-Arizona basketball rivalry is still seen as the match up of the two premier teams in the conference. Also, the performance of the two schools influences the national opinion of the conference. Mike Montgomery, former head coach at both Cal and Stanford has stated, \"...If those two are not good, the conference is not perceived as being good. People don't give credit to the schools across the board in the league.\"\nRanked meetings.\nArizona &amp; UCLA have played 35 games when both programs were ranked.

They played five seasons in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, from 1973 through 1977. Owned by actor Bing Russell, the Mavericks were an independent team, without the affiliation of a parent team in the major leagues. The title is from a line in Jim Bouton's 1970 book \"Ball Four\": \"Us battered bastards of baseball are the biggest customers of the U.S. Post Office, forwarding-address department.\"\nDevelopment.\nThe film was directed by Chapman Way and Maclain Way, grandsons of Russell, and features Russell's son Kurt Russell, who played for the Mavericks and worked as a vice president. It also includes batboy Todd Field, Frank \"The Flake\" Peters, Joe Garza, Jim Bouton, and Joe Garagiola. The film premiered to a standing ovation at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2014. Netflix, initially one of several interested buyers, acquired the rights to the film and premiered it as an Original Documentary on July 11, 2014.\nAfter a bidding war between Fox Searchlight, Columbia Pictures, and DreamWorks, filmmaker Justin Lin acquired the rights to adapt the documentary into a feature film. Oscar-nominated Field was attached to write and direct the adaptation.\nReception.\n\"The Battered Bastards of Baseball\" received positive reviews from critics and has a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\", said in his review that \"So rife with underdog victors and hairpin twists of fortune that, if it weren't all true, no one would believe it.\" Duane Byrge in his review for \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the film by saying that \"The Battered Bastards of Baseball is not just about baseball. It transcends the game and is a charming anti-establishment yarn that should delight audiences who don't even know an RBI from a balk.\"\nDustin Krcatovich, from \"Esquire\", wrote \"easily one of the most raucously entertaining films to come out this year, and the best sports documentary in a while.\" Katie Walsh of \"Indiewire\" graded the film B+ by saying that \"The Batterered Bastards of Baseball is an entertaining celebration of the independent spirit and the love of the game.\"\nThe \"New York Daily News\" listed the documentary as one of the 10 best films of 2014."

        "title": "Ottawa Rowing Club",
        "text": "The Ottawa Rowing Club (ORC) is a rowing club based in the city of Ottawa, Ontario. It is the oldest continuous rowing club in Canada. It is a registered club with Rowing Canada and Row Ontario.\nLocation.\nMembers of the Ottawa Rowing Club practice on the Ottawa River, from Chaudière Falls to Lower Duck Island, passing in front of the mouths of the Rideau River and Gatineau River, and along the shore of Kettle Island.\nHistory.\nEarly rowing clubs.\nIn the 1840s, rowing clubs and regattas appeared in the Upper Canada communities of Toronto, Brockville, Monkton, and Cobourg. By this time, Canadian oarsmen were competing against British and American oarsmen in regattas in Halifax, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other centres.\nHistory from 1867 to 1896.\nThe Ottawa Rowing Club was founded on June 6, 1867. John A. Macdonald was its inaugural president.\nThe club's first regatta, on September 26, 1867, was described as follows:\nThe initial regattas organized by the club were mainly for professional rowers and attracted numerous crews and spectators. As an example, ten races were held at the 1869 regatta, with entrance fees per crew up to $10 and prizes for first place up to $100. A special train by the Saint-Lawrence and Ottawa railroad was offered for \"the convenience of parties desiring to return the same evening.\" Barges were also provided for spectators.\nThe original club house was a wooden building, initially built on pontoons, and moored to the shore of the Ottawa river at the foot of Parliament Hill, between the Rideau canal and the Chaudière Falls. Whilst the view from the club house over the Chaudière Falls was picturesque, the rowing conditions were difficult: vast fields of sawdust and other refuse from an immense lumber mill situated about the falls, and logs escaping from the booms. Each spring, along with the melting ice, the club house floated downstream and came aground. Every year it was brought back up near the Rideau canal. As a result of those difficult environmental conditions, a \"new and commodious boat house\" was built in preparation to the 1869 Regatta organized by the club.\nIn 1870, the club would have ceased their activities and the ownership of the boat house was transferred \"to two or three members of the late Club\". Discussions on the formation of a Boat House Company were held in order to avoid selling the property and boathouse (purchase offers were made by external parties). There is no record of the club from 1871 to 1874, until 25 June 1875 where the club would have been re-introduced with approximately 100 members.\nIn 1884 and 1885, the club house suffered damages when it sank. Members of the club, led by P. D. Ross, discussed building a permanent foundation for the boathouse in 1887. In 1891, Ross, an executive committee member of the Canadian Association of Amateur Oarsmen, declined hosting the association's regatta due to the bad course on the Ottawa river and unsatisfactory financial condition of the Ottawa Rowing Club.\nHistory from 1896.\nIn spring 1896, the club purchase a riverfront property below John A. Macdonald's home Earnscliffe. The boathouse would be left at its current, permanent location.\nFor six consecutive years, from 1905 to 1911, members of the club were the North American champions. The two world wars were difficult years for the club, with fourteen members losing their lives while serving during World War I, and with the boathouse showing signs of deterioration due to neglect.\nDuring the Depression years, P.D. Ross, former editor of the defunct \"Ottawa Journal\", was president of the club. He infuriated his reporters by paying them small salaries while openly spending into equipment and upkeep for the rowing club.\nThe 1950s and 1960s was a period of decline for the Ottawa Rowing Club. After seizing the club due to financial constraints, in 1967 the City of Ottawa agreed to restore the part of the old boathouse which still exists today, but decided to demolish the other half of the building due to its poor condition. The demolished portion of the building stored boats and included a ballroom. In that year, the club only had nine members, and the permanent closure of the club was being debated.\nVolunteers, such as Peter King, supported the development of rowing in Ottawa in the 1970s. The rowing boom resulted in two new clubs (that do not exist anymore): the Nepean Rowing Club and the Ottawa Carleton Rowing School.\nWith close to 1,000 members, the Ottawa Rowing Club is today one of the largest clubs in Canada.\nUniversity rowing.\nIn 1949, when the University of Ottawa created the Physical Education Program, the Ottawa Rowing Club offered equipment and coaches.\nFacilities.\nThe Ottawa Rowing Club facilities includes two main buildings. The older building (est. 1896) houses members' privately owned skiff on the ground floor. The second floor is an interpretation centre that also serves as banquet facilities rented out for weddings and other conventions. The building was renovated in 1999 by the City of Ottawa.\nThe second club house was built in 1987. It consists of a two-story building with four bays for shell and oar storage on the ground floor. Administrative offices, change rooms, and ergometers and weight room are located on the second floor.\nNotable crews and rowers.\nThe 1910 crew.\nIn 1908 two four-man crews won numerous Canadian and American championships. These two crews were joined into a new shell in 1910: the \"Bagnall\", christened to the name of the person who provided the funds to purchase the boat. The eight won the 1910 Royal Canadian Henley Regatta and was the first holder of the Ned Hanlan Memorial Trophy. Within 24 hours of the victory, Ottawans raised funds to bring the crew to the National Association Regatta in Washington, D.C., where the Ottawa crew won again. The eight crew, but also a four-man crew, later competed at the Grand Challenge Cup of the Henley Royal Regatta in 1911, where they lost to Magdalen College, of Oxford in the semi-finals. The coach of the 1910 crew was Jan A. Ten Eyck who captured ten U.S. National Championships as the coach for Syracuse University.\nProfessional hockey player Harvey Pulford joined the Ottawa Rowing Club in 1905, and there, as stroke with the junior fours and then the senior eights, he brought first-place honours to the club at various regattas. In 1909, the Canadian Association of Amateur Oarsmen reinstated him after he had played professional hockey, despite being ineligible to compete as an amateur because he had played professional hockey. He was a member of the 1910 Ottawa Rowing Club eight, and later served as president of the club until his resignation in 1936.\nParticipation in international events.\nBelow is a list of athletes who have rowed with (or coached/worked at) the Ottawa Rowing Club and have participated in international rowing events.\nClub colours.\nThe colours of the club are Navy Blue diagonal stripe with Cardinal Red background. In 1887, the club's uniform consisted of a Navy Blue jacket, trimmed with Cardinal Red, white flannel trousers, and a white guernsey, trimmed with the club colours; and a Navy Blue cap with Cardinal Red bars, or a straw hat with the club colours and Navy Blue and Cardinal Red stripped stockings."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers from 2014 to 2017.\nAmateur career.\nCollins graduated from Northwest High School in Justin, Texas. He began his college baseball career at Baylor University, playing for the Baylor Bears baseball team. After his freshman year, he transferred to Howard College, where he played for the Howard Hawks. He was named the 2011 National Junior College Athletic Association Division I Baseball Player of the Year award, after he led the NJCAA Division I with 19 home runs and finished second with a .488 batting average and 82 runs batted in (RBIs).\nFollowing the 2011 season, Collins committed to transfer to Texas Christian University (TCU) to play for the TCU Horned Frogs.\nProfessional career.\nDetroit Tigers.\nCollins was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the sixth round of the 2011 MLB draft. Collins signed with the Tigers, rather than transfer to TCU. Following the regular season, he played for the Sydney Blue Sox of the Australian Baseball League, and was named to the 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star Game where he earned the game's most valuable player award. After the 2013 season, the Tigers assigned Collins to the Arizona Fall League.\n2014 season.\nOn March 29, 2014, the Detroit Tigers purchased Collins' contract from Double-A Erie, and added him to the 25-man roster. The Tigers intended for Collins to serve as a backup and platoon partner with Rajai Davis. He made his Major League debut March 31, 2014, as a pinch runner for Alex Avila in the bottom of the ninth and scored the winning run to end the game. After batting 2-for-14 in sporadic playing time, the Tigers optioned Collins to the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League on April 18.\nOn September 1, 2014, Collins was called up by the Tigers. Following being called up, Collins entered the game as a pinch hitter in the 9th inning of a game against the Cleveland Indians, where he hit his first career home run.\n2015 season.\nCollins saw more extensive major league playing time in 2015 after the Tigers traded away outfielder Yoenis Céspedes in late July. In 60 games, Collins hit .266 with four home runs and 25 RBIs.\n2016 season.\nOn April 25, 2016, during a home game against the Oakland Athletics, Collins gave the Detroit crowd the finger after he lost a flyball in the lights and the home crowd began booing him. This play allowed Marcus Semien to advance to third base and put Jordan Zimmermann's scoreless streak on the line. Collins apologized after the game, saying that he was \"embarrassed in himself\" by his behavior. He was not suspended, but was optioned to the Toledo Mud Hens on April 27. Collins returned to Detroit on July 15 after Justin Upton was placed on the bereavement list. He remained with the Tigers following the return of Upton, as the team chose to option Steven Moya to AAA instead. He would finish 2016 with a .235 batting average and 4 home runs in 56 games.\n2017 season.\nOn April 6, 2017, Collins hit his first home run of the season, a solo blast in the second inning against the Chicago White Sox. On May 17, Collins had the first multiple home run game of his career, slamming two homers in his first two at-bats against the Baltimore Orioles. He batted .200 on the season through May 28, including 5-for-61 (.082) in his last 20 games, and was designated for assignment.\nCollins cleared waivers and returned to Toledo. Through the end of their regular season, he batted .288 with nine home runs and 46 RBIs in 74 games. Seven days later, on September 10, the Tigers promoted him to the major leagues. He was outrighted to Triple–A on November 2, 2017. He elected free agency on November 6.\nKansas City Royals (2018).\nOn January 17, 2018, Collins signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. After hitting .132 in 18 games with the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League, Collins was released by the Royals on April 27."

        "title": "Indian cricket team in England in 2014",
        "text": "The India national cricket team toured England from 22 June to 7 September 2014 for a five-match Test series, five One Day International matches and one Twenty20 International.\nEngland won the Test series 3–1 and received the Pataudi Trophy. This was the first time since 1959 that India had played five Test matches on an England tour. The third Test, held at the Rose Bowl in Southampton, was the first Test match played in England to start on a Sunday.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nThe 1st Test was a dull affair after the pitch proved to be difficult to bowl on. India won the toss and with the help of Murali Vijay's first century outside India and a 10th-wicket stand of 111 runs from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami, India scored 457. Alastair Cook's poor form with the bat continued and England were at 298/9 late on day 3, but a Test-record 198-run partnership between James Anderson and Joe Root for the final wicket helped them to a lead of 39 runs by the end of the innings. On the morning of the fifth day, some incisive bowling from England led to a possibility of a result. However, a half-century from Stuart Binny on his Test debut meant the match resulted in a draw, but not before Cook brought himself on to bowl, taking his maiden Test wicket in his second over.\nAt the end of the match, it was reported that India had complained against Anderson of physical abuse against Ravindra Jadeja at lunch on day 2, which led to level 3 charges being brought against Anderson and level 2 against Jadeja. The hearing was to be held on 22 July after the end of the 2nd Test. The charge against Jadeja was later reduced to level 1 and he was fined 50 percent of his match fee. The BCCI appealed against the fine and after a six-hour hearing over video conference, both players were found not guilty.\n2nd Test.\nEngland inserted India on a green wicket and soon had them reeling at 145/7 in the second session of the match. However, a century by Ajinkya Rahane and a good knock by Bhuvneshwar Kumar led India to 295. England rode on Gary Ballance's second Test century to take a narrow lead. Fifties from Murali Vijay, Ravindra Jadeja and Bhuvneshwar Kumar in India's second innings meant England required 319 to win the Test. England captain Cook's poor form continued and England ended day 4 needing 209 runs with six wickets in hand. With the last ball before lunch on the final day, Ishant Sharma got Moeen Ali out to a bouncer; India continued to pepper England with relentless short-pitched bowling, and within an hour of play restarting, England were all out. After the match, England wicket-keeper Matt Prior announced that he would step down for the rest of the summer due to injury. This was India's first overseas Test win for three years.\n3rd Test.\nThis was the first Test match played in England to start on a Sunday. The third Test of the series was dominated by England right from the start. England posted a strong first-innings total, helped by centuries from Ian Bell and Ballance, combined with a quick debut half-century by Jos Buttler and a return to form for Cook, before they declared with 14 overs remaining on the second day. In India's first innings, all the batsmen got starts, but a failure to capitalise on them meant that England had a 229-run lead. Thanks to Cook and a quick-fire fifty from Joe Root, England were able to declare for the second time on the stroke of tea on the fourth day, setting India a target of 445 runs for victory. India lost four wickets in the evening session, before Moeen Ali rattled through the lower order before lunch on day 5, resulting in India's worst batting display on the tour up to that point. Ali finished with figures of 8/129 for the match, and England won their first Test in 10 attempts.\n4th Test.\nHaving won the toss and chosen to bat, India collapsed to 8/4 by the sixth over, and despite fighting knocks from captain MS Dhoni and Ravichandran Ashwin, they were bowled out for 152. England scored 367 in reply, a 215-run lead, including half-centuries from Bell, Buttler and Root. England bowler Stuart Broad suffered a broken nose from a delivery by Varun Aaron and was unable to take any further part in the match. In the second innings, England bowled India out for 161 to win the match by an innings and 54 runs and take a 2–1 lead in the series.\n5th Test.\nEngland won the toss and elected to field first, and reduced India to 36/5 before lunch. The visitors were 90/9 by the end of the 45th over, but a 58-run partnership for the 10th wicket from Dhoni and Ishant Sharma brought India to 148 by the end of their innings. Dhoni made more than half of India's runs, scoring 82 before he was caught at long leg off Stuart Broad. England achieved 62 runs for no wicket in the 19 overs that remained of day 1, and went on to reach 385/7 by the end of day 2, Root finishing the day unbeaten on 92. Root went on to reach an unbeaten 149 runs, helping England to a total of 486. Rain meant the players took an early lunch on day 3, with India already 9/2. The final eight wickets fell in just 23 overs after play restarted, with Stuart Binny top-scoring on 25 not out. After the match, India were penalised for a slow over rate during the game, with captain Dhoni receiving a 60% fine of his match fee and the rest of the team 30%.\nBroadcasters.\nThe 5th Test was the 200th live England Test match to be shown on Sky Sports."

Seeds 1-6 received a bye into the quarterfinals. Rather than use the traditional 10-team scheduling format, where one full day was devoted to men's quarterfinals and the other to the women's quarterfinals, the SWAC decided to protect their top 2-seeds by giving them days off between matches. The tournament began with two quarterfinals on Tuesday featuring 7/10 and 8/9. The winner of these two matches moved on to play the 1 (vs. 8/9) and 2 (vs. 7/10) seeds on Wednesday. The 3 vs. 6 and 4 vs. 5 matches did not take place until Thursday. The quarterfinal winners would meet in the semifinals on Friday, and the championship game took place Saturday. The championship game aired live on ESPN3 and then aired tape delayed on ESPNU Sunday."

It was won by Marianne Vos of Netherlands, grabbing her seventh title, the sixth in a row.\nRace report.\nKatie Compton of the United States, one of the two main favourites, had a terrible first few minutes, getting her bike stuck in someone else's. This immediately pushed her down to the back of the pack.\nThat other favourite, Marianne Vos of Netherlands, didn't wait around and finished lap one five seconds ahead of Eva Lechner of Italy and 19 seconds ahead of Helen Wyman of United Kingdom.\nBy the end of lap two the gap had widened to 23 seconds on Lechner, 48 on Sanne Cant of Belgium and 51 on Wyman and Compton who managed to get past the rest of the pack.\nCompton continued her comeback, made the jump to Cant and immediately worked on biking towards Lechner.\nMoments later it seemed like she may have overestimated her powers, dropping back to a fifth spot behind Cant and Wyman again. By the end of the third lap, with only one lap left, Vos had 52s on Lechner and 1m09s on Wyman and Cant. Compton followed at 1m27s, losing her chance at the podium.\nVos never was threatened and took home her seventh World Championship title. Lechner stayed ahead of Wyman and Cant and grabbed silver. Wyman managed to get a small gap on Cant halfway through that last lap, securing the bronze medal. Compton ended up on a ninth spot at almost three minutes."

        "text": "The Baton Rouge Rugby Football Club (also known as BRRFC), founded in 1977, is a men's rugby union team based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. The club competes in and is governed by the True South and USA Rugby.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1977, the club has been a cornerstone of the rugby community boasting healthy numbers and excellent play. Being in Louisiana provided the club distinct advantages with food and culture in the southern region - rugby has been an excellent addition to the Baton Rouge Area. BR RFC has attracted diverse players over the years boasting Men who have worked in Oil/Chemical, Engineers, Lawyers, Doctors, Nurses, Beer Distributors, Semi-Pro Athletes just to name a few.\nMany players are from the surrounding areas: Lafayette, Mandeville, Hammond and New Orleans but also international invites have had players from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji.\nUp until 1991, Baton Rouge played as a Division I Rugby Team, where they secured many national invites, namely the 1985 National Championship game vs Philadelphia Whitemarsh. The club has had a myriad of success throughout the years even after transitioning to Division II rugby in 1992. The Club participates in many local Baton Rouge Charities; most notably Toys for Tots, the BR Women's Shelter, Youth Rugby and the Red Cross.\nFounding Members.\nFounding members include: Hookers, Phil Siccone and Tyrone Yokum; props, Jim Brugh, Reggie Davis, Steve Hazel, and Bob ‘Santa’ Lundsford; locks, Bob Causey and Tom Gagneaux; loose forwards, Barry Haney, Rob Wright, Gary Meyers, and Wayne Fontanelle; No. 8, Mark Lawson and Rick Odom; back, Frank Perkins, Johnny Mclean, Clay Mahaffey, Paul Lachin, Phil Lachin, Bob Dow, Les Bratton, Bill Bratton, Donnie Bratton, and the Hammond connection; Bob Tuminello, Gene Hampton, Bobby Guidera, and Jim Morris.\nTournaments.\nBaton Rouge Rugby puts on two tournaments every year - The Redfish Sevens Tournament and the Ho-Ho-Ho Tournament for Charity.\nRedfish Sevens.\nThe Redfish Tournament is a Rugby Sevens round-robin game. All clubs of any age group, male and female may participate. The tournament usually boasts 25-40 teams every year for the sevens non-qualifier sometime between June and July.\nHo-Ho-Ho Tournament.\nThe Ho-Ho-Ho Tournament is a co-ed scrimmage that occurs every year in December to raise money for Toy-for-Tots, the BR RFC's target charity work every year. In 2016, the club donated 200+ Toys and $400 to the local area Toys for Tots at Happy's Bar. The Scrimmage is unique as players dress up in santa themed outfits and play a toned-down game of rugby so injuries can be avoided. Players come from around the state of Louisiana to participate as ages 17+ are welcome.\nRugby Union Memberships.\nThe Baton Rouge Rugby Football Club was originally a member of Deep South Rugby Football Union.\nIn the late 1990s, the club moved to the Texas Geographical Union where they competed against other TGU Division 1/2 teams such as: Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio and Shreveport. Baton Rouge later returned to the Deep South Rugby Union in 2009, converting back to a Division 2 squad.\nIn 2013, the Deep South Rugby Union became a subdivision of the True South Geographical Union, later becoming True South Rugby where Baton Rouge currently competes against its main rivals:\nPractice/Field Location.\nCurrently, BR RFC practices and plays at Highland Road Park located in Baton Rouge, LA"

        "text": "During the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics, protests and campaigns arose surrounding the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Russia.\nConcerns for LGBT athletes and supporters during the Games began as early as March 2012, when a Russian judge blocked the establishment of a Pride House in Sochi, ruling that \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" would \"undermine the security of Russian society\", and that it conflicted with public morality and the country's policies \"in the area of family motherhood and childhood protection.\" The majority of protests, however, centred on the passing of a law in June 2013, which banned the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. The propaganda law had been characterized by the Western media and other critics as a ban on \"gay propaganda\", arguing that it was broad enough to ban any public display of LGBT symbols and suppress LGBT culture. The law itself was also considered to have caused an increase in homophobic violence, and an increase in the arrest of pro-LGBT protesters. \nThe implications of the law on the then-upcoming Winter Olympics were a major concern among athletes and the Western media, as the Olympic Charter contains language explicitly denouncing all forms of discrimination. Early international pressure was leveraged to compel the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to move the Olympics to another country, as well as pressure on Olympic sponsors to take a stand for LGBT equality. In tandem, calls to boycott and protest the Olympics before, during, and after the games also went out from various organizations and groups, and a number of Olympic athletes came out as a symbolic protest of the law. Prior to the Games, similar pressure was placed on major Olympic sponsors, and several non-sponsors also made public statements in support of LGBT rights. Several national politicians declined to attend the Games, which some Western media outlets attributed as connected to the legislation, while others stated that few leaders normally attend the Winter Games as it is not a \"must attend\" event."

        "title": "Rugby union in Western Australia",
        "text": "Rugby union in Western Australia describes the sport of rugby union being played and watched in the state of Western Australia. First introduced some time in 1868 it was the most popular football code until it was overtaken by Australian rules there in 1885. After a period of decline and recess between 1905 and 1927 it grew throughout the 20th century. The governing body is the Western Australia Rugby Union (RugbyWA).\nRugby clubs are centred on the metropolitan Perth and Fremantle, the game is uncommon elsewhere. Despite being the second most popular code with spectators, rugby has the distinction of holding the record attendance of any football code in the state, with 61,241 attending the Bledisloe Cup at Optus Stadium in 2019.\nWestern Australia is the home of the Western Force, a franchise in the Super Rugby competition since 2006. Their home ground is NIB Stadium, which has a capacity of 20,500 spectators. The development team is the Perth Spirit, which has competed in the Australian Rugby Championship in 2007 and the National Rugby Championship since 2014.\nHistory.\nEarly history: 1860-1892.\nRugby was first played in the Colony of Western Australia in the late 1860s and early 1870s.\nRugby historian Sean Fagan cites a match played in 1868 in Fremantle by a team from West Yorkshire Regiment against a local sides in Perth on the grounds of the Bishop’s Collegiate School as an early example of rugby being played in the colony however historian Geoff Christian counters that these and other early matches were likely played under the Victorian (Australian) rules but that the local paper, the Fremantle Herald advocating strongly for the introduction of British rules in the colony based on the involvement of the English team.\nRugby is believed to have been established in 1876 by British expatriates in Perth who formed the first (rugby) football clubs and introduced it into the schools in 1879 after which it became the most popular football code, with several clubs playing in organised competitions by 1880. Rugby was the leading football code in the colony until the mid 1880s when its popularity was overtaken by Australian rules.\nIn 1885 one of the leading rugby clubs, Fremantle, decided to switch codes. It was quickly joined by three other clubs - , Victorians, and a team of schoolboys from The High School. Rugby was to suffer considerably from this exodus in the latter 1880s.\nRugby Revival and Interstate matches: 1893-1905.\nThe 1890s however saw a revival in West Australian rugby and it continued to be played by a small number of clubs sufficient to form the Western Australian Rugby Union in 1893. A 4 team competition commenced in 1895 with the I Zingari, Fremantle, Swans and Midland Junction Club's taking part. These clubs were joined by a Goldfields Association consisting of the Coolgardie Rugby Football Club and Kalgoorlie Rugby Football Club (Goldfields) (1896). Other Perth based clubs to form later included the Pirate Football Club (1898) and Metropolitan Rugby Football Club (1900).\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, Rugby was rapidly growing in popularity, with a combined Metropolitan vs Districts matches being played interstate matches including the Goldfields and a schools competition begun.\nFrom 1905, Perth, Pioneers and Swan competed for the Levinson Cup, the competition was able to gain access to play on Australian rules football grounds and crowds grew to thousands with some games rivaling the popularity of Australian rules.\nDecline and Hiatus: 1905-1927.\nCompetition in Perth ceased around the end of 1905, though the game continued to be played in the Goldfields region, particularly by the Kalgoorlie Rugby Club. In 1907, a combined Goldfields team hosted the New South Wales team which defeated them 16 to 7 in front of a large crowd.\nThe popularity of rugby faded slowly, with only sporadic competition. Though teams from Sydney continued to tour and promote the game Western Australia's rugby teams were not nearly competitive against New South Wales, however Western Australia's Australian Football team proved it could be competitive against Victoria taking out the Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival in 1908. While the school competitions were initially thriving, the code suffered substantially with the successful introduction of Australian Football into Western Australian schools with junior numbers virtually non-existent. As rugby in the remote mines also faded, Australian rules clubs were beginning to incorporate some of the rugby rules including vigorous tackling.\nIn the face of dwindling numbers, in Perth only two clubs remained: Fremantle and Central. Matches were played at the Esplanade. A visiting Sydney side played Central in June 1909 in front of a large crowd at the Esplanade.\nModern revival: 1928-.\nRugby had not been played in WA for 23 years however it was revived in June 1928 when two teams contested a match in Perth. It was followed by a restarted school competition and the formation of Perth and Fremantle clubs who played at Cottesloe. They were joined by a Northern Suburbs team.\nA state team was once again assembled in 1929 to compete against a visiting team from HMAS Canberra. Rugby in 1930 was once again attracting record crowds, and a 4 team competition was in full swing. The competition was strong enough to field a West Australian team to compete against the touring Great Britain however they were beaten 71 to 3 in front of a crowd of 6,000.\nRugby was relegated to a minor sport until it experienced a revival in the 2000s aided by international migration."

        "text": "David Andrew Buchanan (born May 11, 1989), is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Philadelphia Phillies organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Phillies, in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, and in the KBO League for the Samsung Lions.\nAfter growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Buchanan attended Chipola College from which the New York Mets drafted him in 2009; he did not sign, instead attending Georgia State University. The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Buchanan in 2010, and he quickly moved through their Minor League Baseball (MiLB) system.\nEarly life.\nThe son of Andrew Buchanan and Stacy Wood, Buchanan is one of seven children, (he has two sisters, three step-sisters and one step-brother). He was born in Atlanta, Georgia on May 11, 1989. He attended Fayette County High School, where he played baseball, and, during his senior season, won team most valuable player accolades. He also holds the Fayette County single-game strikeout record (19). Subsequently, he attended Chipola College, a junior college, for two seasons, and earned placement on \"Baseball America\"'s list of the top 40 prospects in Florida. After the 2009 season, the New York Mets drafted him in the sixth round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft, however he did not sign, instead opting to attend Georgia State University. He played for Georgia State during the 2010 season, and was the team's top pitcher, earning several honors from the Colonial Athletic Association before a finger injury caused him to miss significant time. After the 2010 season, he briefly played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The Philadelphia Phillies drafted him in the seventh round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. Scout Ellis Dungan signed him to a contract, and he thus began his professional career.\nProfessional career.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nHe began his professional career in 2010 as a member of the Williamsport Crosscutters, with whom he started 13 games, losing only one of them, and recording a 4.21 earned run average (ERA). At the conclusion of the season, he played in the Florida Instructional League. He progressed to the Single–A and High–A level in 2011, pitching for both the Lakewood BlueClaws and the Clearwater Threshers, and combining to post a 3.49 ERA in 26 starts. He finished third in the South Atlantic League (with Lakewood) by posting 11 wins, and finished seventh with a 3.38 ERA. His steady advancement through the minor league system continued in 2012; the next year, he spent a full season with the Reading Fightin Phils of Double–A. Despite his fast ascent through the minor league system, he flew \"under the radar\" with Reading, despite a 3.86 ERA. However, his season ended in June when the Phillies placed him on the disabled list due to a ligament injury in his middle finger.\nAfter splitting his time in the 2013 season between the Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Triple–A – International League), Buchanan attended a Prospect Education Program hosted by the Phillies organization in January 2014. At the time, he was the only one of the eight attendees who had not been invited to major league camp at spring training, however after taking a \"leadership role\" at the program, Joe Jordan (the Phillies' director of player development) and manager Ryne Sandberg tendered Buchanan an invitation to big league camp. He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, \"I wanted to come in here and make an impression and open us some eyes and I feel like I did that. I feel like I proved myself that I am ready for the next level. I had a blast every day in camp.\"\nWith his college coach on hand to witness a \"monumental time in Georgia State baseball history\", Buchanan made his major league debut against the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 24, 2014. Replacing Cliff Lee, who was injured, Buchanan pitched five innings, and struck out two batters, and allowed five hits, two runs, and no walks in only 66 pitches, en route to earning the win. In his 2014 rookie campaign, Buchanan went 6–8 in 20 starts, with a 3.75 ERA along with 71 strikeouts in 117 innings.\nComing off of an efficient rookie season, the Phillies placed Buchanan as the third starter in their starting rotation going into their 2015 season. After recording a 8.76 ERA giving up 15 walks and 32 hits in first 5 starts to begin the season, the Phillies optioned Buchanan to Lehigh Valley, calling up left-handed relief pitcher Elvis Araujo from Double-A Reading in his place.\nBuchanan was called back up on July 7, 2015, to fill the starting rotation in place of Kevin Correia and Sean O'Sullivan, who were designated for assignment. Buchanan pitched two games with a more respectable 3.18 ERA, giving up 14 hits and 3 walks en route to winning his first decision of the season on July 21, 2015, against the Tampa Bay Rays when he was optioned again to Triple-A after the game to make space in the rotation for Jerome Williams and Aaron Nola. He was recalled a second time just 11 days after roster spots were filled up with trades of Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman and Ben Revere at the trade deadline. Earning his second winning decision against the Atlanta Braves that same day, he lost his next two starts with a 14.54 ERA, giving up 29 hits (5 of them home runs) and 3 walks in the 3 starts since being recalled a second time including a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks where he gave up 11 earned runs in just 1 innings.\nAfter that poor start, Buchanan was optioned a third time to Triple-A, with reliever Cesar Jimenez being called up. Buchanan returned to the major league club for the final two months of the season after the conclusion of the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs' season, pitching in a sixth-man starting rotation manufactured by the Phillies to conserve pitchers. Buchanan started 5 more games for the Phillies that season, going winless with two losses for final record of 2–9 in 15 starts, with a team-high 6.99 ERA among qualifying pitchers that season with 44 strikeouts in 74 innings pitched.\nBuchanan did not play for the Phillies during their 2016 season, spending the whole season with Lehigh Valley and was designated for assignment in November 2016, being released by the organization on November 23.\nTokyo Yakult Swallows.\nOn December 19, 2016, Buchanan signed with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball. On December 13, 2019, he became a free agent.\nSamsung Lions.\nOn January 16, 2020, Buchanan signed a one-year, $850,000 deal with the Samsung Lions of the KBO League. On December 8, 2020, Buchanan resigned with the Lions on a one-year, $1MM deal after pitching to a 3.45 ERA over 174.2 innings for the club in 2020. On December 16, 2021, Buchanan again re-signed for the 2022 season after tying the league-high in wins (16) and setting franchise records for most victories and innings pitched by a foreign player in 2021. Buchanan was named a KBO All-Star for the team in 2022. On December 4, 2022, Buchanan re-signed a one-year $1.6 million contract for the 2023 season.\nBuchanan was again named a KBO All–Star in 2023.\nOn January 4, 2024, Buchanan posted on his wife's Instagram account that he would not be returning to the Samsung Lions for a fifth season.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (second stint).\nOn February 13, 2024, Buchanan signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.\nPitcher profile.\nAlmost as soon as he was drafted into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew comparisons to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in \"The Times Herald\" asserted, \"Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked are the things that get his pitching compared to Kendrick’s: He isn’t overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins over the last seven seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency.\" Buchanan also possesses a strong work ethic – instead of talking to the media or celebrating with teammates after throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out nine, he completed a 45-minute medicine ball workout. In addition to the aforementioned sinker, he throws a slider and a changeup.\nPersonal life.\nOutside of baseball, Buchanan's hobbies include playing the drums and guitar, golfing, drawing, yoga, watching movies, playing spades, and other various \"outdoor activities\". During the offseason, he resides in Peachtree City, Georgia."

James Colliflower coached the team in his first season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and – except for two early games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus – played its home games at the Arcade Rink, also known as the Arcadia and as the Arcade Auditorium, in Washington, D.C. It finished the season with a record of 11–6.\nA forward and letterman for Georgetown for three seasons while attending Georgetown University Law School, new head coach Colliflower would coach the Hoyas for three seasons, shepherding the team through disputes over it between the undergraduate campus and the Law School. He would compile an overall record of 32–17 before retiring after the 1913–14 season to concentrate on his coal delivery business and to make way for Georgetown's first full-time head coach, John O'Reilly. After O'Reilly fell ill and was unable to coach during the 1921–22 season, however, Colliflower would return for one last season as head coach – without pay – and improve his overall record to 43–20 before leaving coaching for good.\nSeason recap.\nSenior forward-center Frank Schlosser led the team in scoring for the fourth straight year, the first man to do so and one of only three men to do so in the first 100 years of Georgetown basketball history. He played in 15 games and scored 159 points averaging 10.1 points per game, half the team's average of 20.2 per game. He finished his collegiate career with 601 points and an average of 10.4 points per game, one of only three men to average in double figures over his career at Georgetown between the 1906-07 and 1942-43 seasons, the \"Vintage Era\" of Georgetown men's basketball.\nSophomore forward Ronayne \"Roy\" Waldron was a walk-on who had been called up to the varsity the previous season to play in seven games as a reserve, otherwise playing on the Collegians, an undergraduate team (in an era when the varsity program centered around Georgetown University Law School students) that played against local teams in the Washington, D.C., area. This season, still with the Collegians, he was called up to the varsity again and played in nine games, starting seven of them. He scored a total of 40 points for the season, averaging 4.4 points per game, but he scored a career-high 17 points in a game against Virginia. That performance made him a letterman and, after Schlosser graduated, he would become the team's leading scorer for the next two seasons and one of the top offensive producers of the early years of Georgetown basketball.\nRoster.\nSources\nGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season.

        "text": "William John Morris (born 16 June 1941) was an Australian born, Welsh international rugby union lock who played club rugby for Wrexham and Newport and international rugby for Wales. Morris also played for the Barbarians and toured with them to South Africa in 1969, during the apartheid era. He is the third of four players known as Bill Morris to represent Wales at rugby union.\nPersonal history.\nMorris was born in Australia in 1941, the son of a Welsh man who had joined the Colonial Service and while in Australia had joined the Australian Air Force on the outbreak of the Second World War. His mother was a Russian from Vladivostok, who his father had met in China. His family returned to Britain settling in Wrexham, north Wales where Morris attended Grove Park School. On leaving education he gained employment as a solicitor.\nRugby career.\nMorris played rugby as a youth for his school and at club level he first joined Wrexham and also turned out for English team New Brighton F.C. A promising young adult, he was first capped for Wales at under-23 level, before moving to Newport to play with top-flight Welsh club Newport during the 1963/64 season. He first represented Newport against Bristol on 14 September 1963, and as a second row lock, he forged a strong pairing with club captain Brian Price.\nMorris gained his first cap for Wales in the fixture against Scotland in Murrayfield as part of the 1965 Five Nations Championship. He was brought in alongside Price and the result was a narrow 14-12 win to Wales. Although this was Morris' only match of the Championship, Wales had already beaten England, and went on to defeat Ireland, making Morris part of a Triple Crown winning side. His second and final international cap was in the 1966 Championship in Ireland. With Wales clinging on to a narrow victory, Morris, in the final seconds inexplicably threw the ball into touch awarding Ireland a penalty kick which could draw the game. Fortunately for Morris, a strong wind saw French kicker Claude Lacaze's effort swept away from the post to give Wales the match. Whether his poor final minute decision was a factor is unknown, but Morris was not selected for Wales again.\nMorris continued to represent Newport, and in 1966 he was part of the team that faced Australia in their 1966/67 tour. Newport drew 3-3, though at one point Morris had thought he had put his team in front with a try, only for it to be disallowed by the referee. In total he made 167 appearances for Newport, scoring 16 tries before retiring from the sport in 1969.\nThe final team that Morris represented was invitational tourists, the Barbarians. He was first invited to play for the 'Baa-Baas' during the 1965 season when he played against East Midlands. It would be four years until he was again called to play, when he was selected to join the team on their 1969 Easter tour. On that tour he played against East Midland, Cardiff and Swansea. That year he was invited to join the Barbarians on their third overseas tour, on a controversial trip to South Africa during apartheid. Six games were played in South Africa, against regional and invitational teams, and Morris played in four of them, Quaggas, SA Barbarians, South African Country Districts and Rhodesia. On returning to Britain he quit rugby citing the 'pressures of his job'.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "History of rugby union in Wales",
        "text": "Rugby union has a long history in Wales. Today it holds tier one status with the IRB. However, compared to Scotland, England, and Ireland, it was a latecomer on the international scene, and was not initially successful. Rugby union is the national sport of Wales, and is a great influence on Welsh culture.\nEarly history and 19th century.\nPre-codification football.\nRugby-like games have a long history in Wales, with games such as cnapan being played for centuries. Cnapan originated in, and seems to have remained largely confined to, the western counties of Wales, especially Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire. According to George Owen of Henllys, in his \"Description of Pembrokeshire\" (1603), \"cnapan\" had been \"extremely popular in Pembrokeshire since greate antiquitie [sic]\". Cnapan was one of the traditional ball games played to celebrate Shrovetide and Eastertide in the British Isles. These games were the forerunners of the codified football games first developed by Public Schools which led to the creation of association football and Rugby football in the 19th century. Cnapan continued to be played until the rising popularity of rugby resulted in the game falling into decline.\nEarly rugby football.\nRugby seems to have reached Wales in 1850, when the Reverend Professor Rowland Williams brought the game with him from Cambridge to St. David's College, Lampeter, which fielded the first Welsh rugby team that same year.\nRugby initially expanded in Wales through ex-pupils of the Welsh colleges settling, or students from English colleges and universities returning to the larger industrial hubs of South Wales. This is reflected in the first clubs to embrace the sport in the early to mid-1870s, with Neath RFC widely recognised as being the first Welsh club. The strength of Welsh rugby developed over the following years, which could be attributed to the 'big four' South Wales clubs of Newport (who lost only seven games under the captaincy of Llewellyn Lloyd between the 1900/01 and 1902/03 seasons), Cardiff, Llanelli (who lost just twice in 1894 and 1895) and Swansea. With the coming of industrialisation and the railways, rugby too was spread as workers from the main cities brought the game to the new steel and coal towns of south Wales. Pontypool RFC formed 1868 came to be a stronghold of the game dominating the unprofessional club rugby scene in the 1970s and 1980s.Mountain Ash formed in 1875, and is a far better club than Abercynon RFC, Merthyr formed in 1876, Brecon in 1874, Penygraig in 1877; as the towns adopted the new sport they reflected the growth and expansion of a new industrial Wales.\nIn the 19th century as well as the established clubs there were many 'scratch' teams populating most towns, informal pub or social teams that would form and disband quickly. Llanelli, as an example, in the 1880s was home not only to Llanelli RFC, but also to Gower Road, Seasiders, Morfa Rangers, Prospect Place Rovers, Wern Foundry, Cooper Mills Rangers, New Dock Strollers, Vauxhall Juniors, Moonlight Rovers and Gilbert Street Rovers. These teams would come and go, but some would merge into more settled clubs which exist today, Cardiff RFC was itself formed from three teams, Glamorgan, Tredegarville and Wanderers Football Clubs.\nThe South Wales Football Club was established in 1875 to try to incorporate a standard set of rules and expand the sport and this was succeeded by the Welsh Football Union which was formed in 1881. With the forming of the WFU (which would become the Welsh Rugby Union in 1934), Wales began competing in recognised international matches, with the first game, against England, also in 1881. The first Welsh team although fairly diverse in the geography of the clubs represented, did not appear to truly represent the strength available to Wales. The team was mainly made up of ex-Cambridge and Oxford university graduates and the selection was heavily criticised in the local press after the crushing defeat by England.\nBy the end of the 19th century, a group of exciting Welsh players began to emerge, including Arthur Gould, Dick Hellings, Billy Bancroft and Gwyn Nicholls; players that would be regarded as the first super-stars of Welsh rugby and would usher in not only the first golden era of Welsh rugby, but would also see the introduction of specialised positional players.\nTwentieth century.\nArrival of rugby league.\nThe schism with rugby league had far more effect in northern England, than in Wales, although there were attempts to introduce it. Defections to the other code were not uncommon by Welsh players, and Welsh rugby league is more deeply rooted than its Scottish and Irish counterparts.\nThe Northern Union's administrators began to ponder the possibilities of international competitions against an English representative side. The first attempt met with a lack of public interest, and the first scheduled Northern Union international, also became the first postponed Northern Union international. It was rescheduled for the 5 April 1904. The team opposing England was labelled Other Nationalities and consisted of Welshmen and a few Scots. The Other Nationalities proved too strong, defeating the English 9 - 3. In 1905, England gained back some credibility with a 21 - 11 win.\nIn 1907 a professional version of the \"All Blacks\" rugby team from New Zealand (nicknamed the All Golds by Australian press) toured England in what became the first set of international games played under the new NU rules. The All Golds had not played under the Northern Union rules and underwent a week of intensive training. The first Wales international league game took place at Aberdare on 1 January 1908 played against the All Golds. Wales went on to defeat New Zealand 9-8, the winning try scored by former Wales rugby union international Dai Jones.\nIn 1907, the Welsh Northern Union was formed in Wrexham, but the Northern Union refused it affiliation as they wanted the body located in the South of Wales and the WNU soon folded. In 1907 two Welsh clubs Ebbw Vale RLFC and Merthyr Tydfil RLFC joined the Northern Union and also competed in the Challenge Cup.\nDuring the 1908-09 season, there were sufficient numbers of Welsh clubs to run a separate Welsh League section of the competition, alongside the Northern Union's Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues. The Welsh League lasted only two seasons before folding in 1910 after most of the competing teams disbanded.\nThe first golden era 1900–1919.\nThe first 'Golden Era' of Welsh rugby is so called due to the success achieved by the national team during the early 20th century. Wales had already won the Triple Crown in 1893, but between 1900 and 1914 the team would win the trophy on six occasions, and with France joining the tournament (unofficially in 1908 and 1909) three Grand Slams.\nWith the introduction of specialised players like hooker George Travers, the WFU could no longer choose the 'best players' to represent Wales, they needed to think tactically and choose people who could do a specific job on the pitch. This period of Welsh rugby would see the grip of the 'Big Four' clubs providing the bulk of national players, slip slightly. The WFU still tended to turn to the likes of Swansea and Newport to supply the skillful back players and usually kept club half-back pairings together such as Jones and Owen of Swansea. But it was the introduction of the 'Rhondda Forward' which saw men who worked day in day out in the coal, iron and tin mines enter the Welsh front row. Chosen for their strength and aggressive tackling, players such as Dai 'Tarw' Jones from Treherbert and Dai Evans from Penygraig added muscle to the front row.\nAlthough a progressive time for international rugby, this period initially saw regression for many of the club sides in the form of the temperance movement. In the early 1900s, rugby was seen as a wicked temptation to the young men of the mining and steel communities, leading to violence and drink, and the valley areas in particular were part of a strong Nonconformist Baptist movement. The religious revival saw some communities completely reject rugby and local clubs, like Senghenydd, disbanded for several years. It wasn't until the 1910s that the social view of rugby would change the other way, fostered by mine owners as a great social unifier; and like baseball in America would be portrayed as a '...source of community integration because it installed civic pride'.\nUnlike the game in England, rugby union in Wales was never seen as a sport for gentlemen of higher learning. Although this was fostered in the first international Welsh team, the fast absorption of the sport into the working class areas appeared to sever the link of rugby as a sport for the middle and upper classes.\nAs rugby became linked with the hard working men of the industrialised areas of Wales, the sport did not escape the hardships of the industries. In 1913 five members of the Senghenydd team were killed in Britain's worst colliery disaster and many more lost their lives in the 'slow drip' of deaths caused by the industries. Far worse was to follow during the conflict of World War I when many teams lost members, including Welsh internationals like Charlie Pritchard and Johnny Williams.\nPost-war Welsh rugby 1920–1930.\nThe 1920s were a difficult time for Welsh rugby. The first golden period was over and the players that made up the teams that won four Triple Crowns had already disbanded before the Great War. The war could not be blamed for the downturn in Welsh fortunes as all the home nations lost their young talent in equal numbers. The fact that so many of Wales' talented stars had retired from rugby before 1910 was felt when Wales failed to win the tournament in the few years leading up to the war. But the main reason for Welsh failure on the rugby pitch can be mapped to an economic failures of Wales as a country. The First World War had created an unrealistic demand for coal, and in the 1920s the collapse in the need for coal resulted in a massive level of unemployment throughout the south Wales valleys. This in turn led to mass emigration as people left Wales for work. The knock-on effect was felt in the port cities of Newport and Cardiff, that relied on the transportation of coal.\nSuddenly the call of the professional league was a very strong draw to men who could not claim money for playing union. Between 1919 and 1939, Forty-eight capped Welsh rugby union players joined league rugby. The fact that the equivalent of three full national squads left the sport can only allude to the number of trialists and club members that also left the sport. Exceptional players lost to the league game included Jim Sullivan of Cardiff, William Absalom of Abercarn and Emlyn Jenkins of Treorchy.\nThe other side of the depression was linked to those people that stayed behind. In homes where men were the only earners, the decline in heavy labour areas resulted in very stark choices in where the household money could be spent. It was difficult to justify paying to watch rugby when there was little money for food and rent. With crowds dwindling clubs were forced to drastic measures in the hope of survival. Loughor which had produced five internationals in the 1920s were by 1929 begging door to door for old kit. Haverfordwest disbanded from 1926–29, Pembroke Dock Quins were reduced to 5 members by 1927 and in the valleys the Treherbert, Llwynypia and Nantyffyllon clubs had vanished before 1930. Even clubs of the size of Pontypool were not spared; in 1927 they were playing and beating the Waratahs and the Maoris, by 1930 they were £2,000 in debt and facing bankruptcy.\nAnother reason for the fall in the Welsh union game can be placed on the improvement of football in Wales. Traditionally seen as a game more associated with North Wales, the success of Cardiff Football Club in the 1920s was a strong draw for many supporters. With two F.A. Cup Finals in 1925 and 1927, Cardiff were making the once unpopular sport of 'soccer' very fashionable, for fans and sportsmen alike.\nDuring the 1920s the one team that appeared to be unaffected by the double threat of soccer and debt was Llanelli. The Scarlets had an unswerving loyalty shown by their home supporters, who were repaid by exciting, high scoring matches. During the 1925/26 season the club were unbeaten and the next season they had achieved the unprecedented feat of defeating Cardiff on four occasions. This success would later be reflected in the growing number of Llanelli players that would represent their country in the 1920s, including Albert Jenkins, Ivor Jones and Archie Skym.\nApart from a few sporadic victories from the national team, there appeared little to cheer about in the 1920s for Welsh rugby at club or country level; but the seeds of recovery were being planted during the same decade. On 9 June 1923 the Welsh Secondary Schools Rugby Union was established in Cardiff. Founded by Dr R Chalke, head of Porth Secondary School with WRU members Horace Lyne as president and Eric Evans as secretary. Its aim was to promote rugby at school level in an attempt to regain 'the glorious days of Gwyn Nicholls, Willie Llewellyn and Dr E.T. Morgan'. In April 1923, at the Arms Park, Wales played their first secondary schools fixture led by future international Watcyn Thomas, who would progress to captain the first Welsh University XV in 1926. Over the coming years, schools such as Cardiff High School, Llanelli County School, Llandovery and Christ College, Brecon fostered a generation of players which would fill the Welsh ranks over the coming years. Wales had in effect begun to mimic the systems adopted by England and Scotland, that rugby should be nurtured from youth, through adolescence to adulthood.\nThe 1920s closed with the formation of the West Wales Rugby Union, an event that initially appeared to be a positive indication of growth, but in fact the union was formed by western clubs to wrest control away from the WRU. The West Wales clubs had become disenchanted in decisions made by their parent body and believed the Union had no interest in the lower tier clubs, allowing them to become mere feeders for the bigger clubs.\nThe Welsh revival 1930–1939.\nThe 1930s began on a high for Welsh international rugby, with success in the Home Nations Championship and the emergence of a strong Welsh team. In the 1931 Championship Wales beat Ireland at Ravenhill in a bruising affair that not only gave Wales the title but denied Ireland the Triple Crown. This may have signaled a change in fortunes in Welsh rugby but underneath the same problems that dogged Wales throughout the 1920s still remained. Wales was still suffering the effects of the depression and club rugby was struggling to survive. Even the WRU had problems, as it faced the fact that it was the only home union without their own ground. The Cardiff Arms was leased and St Helens was on loan. In 1934 nine clubs formed the Welsh Rugby Union with the consent of the WFU.\nFrom what at first appears to be yet another decade of turmoil for Welsh rugby, is actually regarded as a period of revival. The economic situation began turning from 1937, the WSSRU was bringing many exciting backs through the school system, North Wales embraced the game and the national team won two morale lifting games against England in 1933 and the All Blacks in 1935.\nFrom a statistical point of view, the Welsh national team appeared to be winning roughly the same number of games throughout the 1930s as the poor 1920s period, but Wales were actually improving. In the 1920s most Welsh victories were against France, then the weakest team in the Five Nations Championship; but in 1931 France were excluded from the tournament over accusations of professionalism at club level and were not readmitted until after the 1939 tournament, just before international rugby was suspended because of the Second World War. Welsh victories were now coming against the more established home nation teams. During this period, Wales won three Championships, but its greatest victory happened during the 1933 tournament when they finished last. Since its first international game in 1910, Wales had failed to beat England at Twickenham in nine attempts. Now dubbed the 'Twickenham bogey', it took the self-confidence of Cardiff's Ronnie Boon to break the losing streak as he scored a try and a drop goal to take the match 7-3. The game also saw the debut of two players who would become Welsh greats, Wilf Wooller and Vivian Jenkins.\nWales played host to two touring Southern Hemisphere teams in the 1930s, first came Bennie Osler's South Africa followed by Jack Manchester's All Blacks. The South Africans were rampant in Wales, winning the test match and all six club matches, though gained few supporters due to the kicking tactics Osler employed. The New Zealander's received a better welcome, and after the previous tour where the tourist went unbeaten the Welsh press were hoping for a return of the spirit that won the first encounter in 1905. Before the match with Wales, New Zealand were to face eight club teams over six games. After winning the opening three English county matches and then beating a joint Abertillery and Cross Keys the All Blacks were showing the same form shown in their first two tours, but then stumbled against Swansea. Swansea were not in a period of particular growth and the only two players showing any flair were Wales Schoolboy players Willie Davies and Haydn Tanner. During the game Merv Corner could not contain the attacking bursts from Tanner, the New Zealand flankers were drawn in which in turned allowed Davies the freedom to run which Claude Davey finished off with two tries. Jack Manchester's response to the Swansea win was to ask the New Zealand press \"Tell them we have been beaten, but don't tell them it was by a pair of schoolboys\". This win gave Swansea the honour of being the first club team to have beaten all three major Southern Hemisphere touring teams. The All Blacks were unbeaten in the next twenty matches, but lost to Wales in a classic game which Wales managed to win in the last ten minutes of the game after the Welsh hooker, Don Tarr, was stretchered off with a broken neck.\nPost-war Welsh rugby 1945–1959.\nThe post-war years saw strong club teams emerge, but it wasn’t until the 1950s that a true blend of players could be produced to translate club success into international victories. The coming of television saw an upsurge in popularity for the national team, but a decline in club support. Success was gained in the Five Nations Championship, Wales supplied many players to the ranks of the British Lions and New Zealand was beaten for the last time that century.\nThe decades following on from the Second World War were a boom time for Welsh rugby, though it took until the 1950s for the benefits to be seen on the playing fields. Although Britain was suffering from a post-war slump, attendance figures at club grounds saw an increase as rugby was again embraced as a spectator sport. Towns and villages which had seen their club disbanded during wartime saw their teams re-established. The WRU had 104 member clubs during the 1946-47 season; by the mid fifties there were 130, even though the Union had done nothing to relax its strict membership regulations.\nBy the 1950s Britain and Wales were beginning to benefit from improved economic conditions. This saw growth in consumer power and spending, which drew many people away from traditional spectator past times, such as sport and the cinema. With a newfound wealth the populace began switching from social pursuits to home entertainment, with the biggest draw being the availability of television. From the mid-fifties there was a significant drop in gate receipts as television became more and more popular. During the 1955 Five Nations Championship, the Scotland v. Wales match was televised live; at the same time an Aberavon v. Abertillery game which would normally draw a crowd of 4000 was unable to muster 400. This created a situation whereby rugby in Wales was gaining in popularity due to the number of people who could now watch the international matches, but support at club level declined. This forced club committees to adopt different strategies to keep their clubs afloat. Many teams set up 'coupon funds' to allow clothing rations to be contributed by members to buy kit. With careful management and thrift most clubs not only survived but grew. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with little money, many clubs were able to build new facilities or even own their grounds and club-houses for the first time in their history. In 1951 Glamorgan Wanderers purchased the Memorial Grounds in Ely and in 1952 Llanelli were able to purchase the rugby portion of Stradey Park. Similarly, 1954 saw Blaina construct a new stand while Llanharan were able to build their first changing rooms procured from RAF surplus units. These events were typical of club expansion through the 50s. It was around this time that club social activities were extended including the introduction of ladies’ committees.\nClubs also took matters into their own hands to promote themselves and their sport. 1947 saw the first unofficial club championship, won by Neath in its inaugural year, but dominated by Cardiff and Ebbw Vale until the 1960/61 season. In 1954 Welsh rugby sevens had their own tournament with the introduction of the Snelling Sevens competition, while Glamorgan County RFC introduced the Silver Ball Trophy in 1956 for the promotion of second tier clubs in the region.\nThe national team, after unconvincing displays during the 1940s, found unexpected success in the early 1950s winning the Grand Slam twice; in 1950 and 1952. The 1950 win came after a disastrous 1949 campaign, which saw Wales collect the wooden spoon; but after an opening win over England, the team finished the last three matches conceding only three points. The tournament saw the emergence of Welsh record breaking player Ken Jones as a world class wing; who is most remembered for his late try against the 1953 touring New Zealand team. The 1950 championship is also remembered for the tragic events following the away win to Ireland when a chartered flight, returning from the Triple Crown winning match, crashed at Llandow. Seventy five Welsh fans and five crew died in the accident, at the time it was the world's worst air disaster.\nThe second golden era 1969–1979.\nThe zenith of Welsh rugby was the 1970s, when Wales had players such as Barry John, Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett and JPR Williams. Wales won four consecutive Triple Crowns. All of these players are considered amongst the best players of Welsh rugby, especially Edwards who was voted the greatest player of all time in a players poll in 2003 and scored what is widely regarded as the greatest try of all time in 1973 for the Barbarians against New Zealand.\nMany attributed Welsh success to the fact that their forwards were toughened by manual work, according to the theory when Welsh industry declined and players started to be drawn from 'soft jobs' the team suffered. The strong Pontypool front row of Graham Price, Bobby Windsor &amp; Charlie Faulkner were all manual workers, and Robin McBryde was formerly the holder of the title of Wales's strongest man.\nShamateurism and the professional era: 1980 to date.\nThe 1980s and early '90s were a difficult time for Welsh rugby union when the team suffered many defeats. Harsh economic times in the eighties meant that players such as Jonathan Davies and Scott Gibbs were tempted to 'go North' to play professional rugby league in order to earn a living.\nIn 2003/4 the Welsh Rugby Union voted to create five regions to play in the Celtic League (now the RaboDirect Pro12) and represent Wales in European competition. This soon became four when the Celtic Warriors were liquidated after just one season. The WRU have announced their hopes of developing a fifth region in North Wales in the long run; the team at the centre of this plan is now known as RGC 1404."

Over the next four seasons they played 13 matches, winning two, losing six and drawing five.\nBoth their victories were against Lahore Division, in 1984-85 and 1985–86. In the 1985–86 victory, by an innings and 41 runs, Farhat Masood had match figures of 10 for 56 (6 for 37 and 4 for 19), which remained Gujranwala's best match figures.\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board decided to cut back the number of first-class matches for the 1987–88 season, and Gujranwala returned to sub-first-class level.\n1990s and 2000s.\nGujranwala won the second division (non-first-class) of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1996–97, and were promoted to the first-class level of the Trophy in 1997–98.

Over the next six seasons Sialkot won the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy twice and finished second twice.\nGujranwala continue to play at sub-first-class level. Currently they take part in the Inter-District Senior Tournament, a three-day national competition, playing other teams from the Sialkot region.\nIndividual records.\nGujranwala's highest individual score was 201 not out (off 276 balls) by Zahid Fazal in an innings victory over Hyderabad in 1998–99.

This will continue until there are 12 NOCs with four competitors. Any remaining quotas will be distributed until the quota limit of 70 is reached.\nQuota allocation.\nFinal allocation as of February 3, 2014. Alexandra Pretorius of Canada withdrew due to injury and will be replaced by Gyda Enger of Norway.\nNext eligible NOC per event.\nIf a country rejects a quota spot then additional quotas become available.

It was one of six candidates, but failed to be short-listed.\nVenues.\nThe proposed venues were:\nEvaluation.\nThe proposed bid was considered as a compact sports concept in attractive surroundings, with many venues yet to be constructed. The post-Olympic use of the ice facilities was excellent as all arenas will be dedicated for ice sports development in an area already known for its passion for ice-hockey. The IOC Evaluating Committee favoured the location of all alpine events in one venue, Jasná, which had already hosted World Cup and several international competitions and was located 60 minutes from the Main Olympic Village. The experience of the Slovak Republic in providing high profile event security was rated as moderate, but the country itself hadn't experienced unusual security problems. A referendum held in the communes of the region, as well as opinion polls in 1997 and 1998 throughout Slovakia, showed a considerable majority in support of the bid. Whilst an Olympic Games marketing programme was new to Slovakia, the Bid Committee appeared to have shown diligence in evaluating the possibilities in marketing plans and opportunities.\nHowever, the IOC evaluating report listed some problems that might have effected the Winter Games preparations. The proximity of a major road to the biathlon venue in Štrba may have been a concern for the performance of the athletes. Although Svit, where bobsleigh, luge and skeleton track was planned, is not within the National Park, there could have been environmental concerns as much deforestation was required. The Bid Committee had been unable to secure a partner willing to cover the cost of constructing the Olympic Village. Further, the Evaluation Commission considered that the operating budget of the Village appears to be on the low side and no budget could have been found for the additional accommodations. The Evaluation Commission believed also that accommodation in Poprad needed to be further developed.\nWhile the proposed highway and railway transport concept was considered as sufficient, the Poprad-Tatry Airport could accepted only medium sized jet aircraft, and didn't have regularly scheduled flights.\nThe Evaluation Commission believed that the costs of building infrastructure for and putting on the Olympic Games, would be a significant challenge to the financial resources of both the public and private sectors in Slovakia.\nAftermath.\nAfter selection, Poprad didn't bid for Olympics, but withdrawn Kraków bid for 2022 Games included Chopok Mountain as a venue for alpine skiing events."

        "title": "South Sydney District Junior Rugby Football League",
        "text": "The South Sydney District Junior Rugby Football League is an affiliation of junior clubs in the inner southern and south-eastern suburbs.\nHistory.\nWhen the South Sydney Rabbitohs first entered the NSWRL competition as South Sydney in 1908, Souths would become neighbours to fellow city counterpart, the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Anzac Parade separated the territories for both inner-Sydney clubs when the boundaries were first established the previous year. Souths' boundaries were based on the municipalities of Redfern, Botany, Alexandria, Mascot and Waterloo, while the Roosters' boundaries were those of the eastern municipalities of Paddington, Woollahra, Vaucluse and Waverley.\nThe new junior league boundaries set out in the early 1950s would take territory away from the Roosters, and hand it over to rival neighbouring club South Sydney.\nIn the mid-20th century, the southern half of Roosters territory within the Randwick local government area was handed to South Sydney. The NSWRL made this change to 'even the competition' as South Sydney's original heartland, around Redfern and Waterloo, had rapidly industrialised and de-populated. Rabbitohs stalwart S.G. Ball was a dual administrator within South Sydney Rabbitohs and the New South Wales Rugby League at the time. The Rabbitohs were in a highly successful period and had established South Sydney Juniors Rugby League Club in Kingsford, Roosters territory in recent times.\nDebate still continues amongst rival fans as to how and why Eastern Suburbs territory, comprising suburbs with junior league clubs rich in talent and numbers in the Randwick and Coogee areas, was given to South Sydney. The Roosters expressed disappointment at losing some of its junior clubs, but the NSWRL would not waver.\nThis was not to be the end of struggle for junior territory between the two inner-city clubs. In the 1980s some junior clubs such as Paddington Colts that were within Roosters territory became dissatisfied with Roosters management and affiliated with South Sydney.\nAfter the Newtown Jets were expelled from the NSWRL in 1983, their junior district was eventually absorbed into the South Sydney junior district in 1987. With the tide having turned compared to the situation decades earlier, and the Roosters having a much smaller junior League than South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs at this time then made unsuccessful attempts to regain the suburbs on the same grounds used to hand the southern parts of Coogee and Randwick from Easts to Souths, that of providing an 'even competition'. The NSWRL, controlled at the time by a Board with a ruling faction of representatives from South Sydney (Terry Parker), Balmain (Keith Barnes), Canterbury (Peter Moore) and Manly (Ken Arthurson), refused to redraw the boundaries.\nA Grade Premierships.\nReference: \nA Reserve Premierships.\n2023 Alexandria rovers \nTeam of the Century.\nOn 16 May 2008, the South Sydney Juniors Team of the Century was named at the Centenary Ball.\nCoach: Alf Blair (Waterloo Albions)"

        "title": "Andrew Hammond (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Andrew Robert Hammond (born February 11, 1988) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Ottawa Senators, Colorado Avalanche, Montreal Canadiens and New Jersey Devils. Nicknamed the \"Hamburglar\", he rose to fame in 2014–15 when he was called up from the minors and led the Senators to a 20–1–2 record to clinch a previously unthinkable Stanley Cup playoff berth.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nHammond played his junior hockey in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). He played one game with the Westside Warriors in the 2006–07 season before being cut by the team and returning to the Grandview Steelers of the Junior \"B\" Pacific Junior Hockey League to finish the season. Hammond played 32 games with the Surrey Eagles to start the 2007–08 BCHL season before being traded to the Vernon Vipers for $2,500. In his final season with the Vipers, the team won the Royal Bank Cup national Junior \"A\" championship and Hammond posted a 2–0 shutout in the final game.\nHammond attended Bowling Green State University where he played four seasons (2009 to 2013) with the Falcons ice hockey team. In 111 NCAA games, he earned a record of 30–68–13 and was named Bowling Green's Most Valuable Player for both the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons. It was at Bowling Green that Hammond's ability to \"steal\" wins for the Falcons prompted teammate Wade Finegan to start calling the goaltender \"Robber,\" then \"Burglar,\" then simply \"Burgs.\" The nickname finally evolved to \"The Hamburglar.\" A play on his name, the nickname refers to the McDonald's restaurants' mascot character whose likeness, in the guise of \"MAD\" magazines' Alfred E. Neuman, Hammond had painted onto his goalie mask.\nProfessional.\nOttawa Senators (2013–2017).\nThe NHL's Ottawa Senators signed Hammond as a free agent goaltender to a two-year, entry-level contract on March 20, 2013. He was subsequently assigned to the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, where he finished the 2012–13 season.\nHammond attended the Senators' training camp ahead of the 2013–14 season, but was later designated to Binghamton on September 30, 2013. He was recalled by Ottawa on February 26, 2014, to replace goaltender Craig Anderson, who was with his wife for the birth of the couple's second child. The next day, Hammond, who backed-up goaltender Robin Lehner, entered a game against the Detroit Red Wings at 5:05 of the second period after Lehner gave up six goals and was pulled. Hammond stopped all 11 shots he faced in the remainder of the game.\nHammond attended Ottawa's training camp ahead of the 2014–15 season, but on September 29, 2014, was again designated to Binghamton to start the season. He made his first career NHL start against the Montreal Canadiens at the Canadian Tire Centre on February 18, 2015, after goaltender Robin Lehner was injured in Ottawa's previous game. Hammond earned his first NHL victory in the game, stopping 42 shots in a 4–2 victory, also being named the game's First Star. Two games later, he recorded his first career NHL shutout as the Senators defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3–0, and the next day, he recorded his second consecutive shutout in a 1–0 win over the Los Angeles Kings. Hammond's four consecutive wins marked only the second time of the season that Ottawa won more than two games in a row. On March 2, 2015, Hammond was rewarded for his surprising success as the NHL named him the First Star of the Week. After winning a game against the Carolina Hurricanes in overtime on March 17, Hammond became just the second goaltender in NHL history to allow two goals or fewer in their first 12 starts, a feat matching Hockey Hall of Famer Frank Brimsek's record set during the 1938–39 season with the Boston Bruins.\nOn April 1, 2015, Hammond was named the NHL's First Star for the Month of March after compiling a 10–1–1 record with a 2.09 goals against average (GAA) and a .930 save percentage, helping the Senators climb to within three points of the final Wild Card spot in the Eastern Conference. On the same day, the Ottawa Chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association announced Hammond as Ottawa's 2015 nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, awarded annually to the NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. He came seventh in voting for the Vezina Trophy for the league's best goaltender and fifteenth in voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy for most valuable player to his team.\nHammond finished the 2014–15 regular season with a record of 20–1–2, helping the Senators clinch a Stanley Cup playoff berth, where they were eventually ousted by the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. Hammond started Ottawa's first two games of the series before being replaced by Craig Anderson for the following four games.\nOn May 20, shortly after the end of the Senators' season, Hammond was rewarded by signing a three-year, $4.05 million contract extension with Ottawa, carrying an average annual value of $1.35 million. In the following 2015–16 season, Hammond was unable to replicate his previous season success, winning just 7 out of 24 games with the Senators including a two-game return to the Binghamton Senators.\nBy the 2016–17 season, Hammond was struggling through a lack of form and hampered through injury. He appeared in just 6 games with Ottawa in a backup role going winless before on February 11, 2017, Hammond's 29th birthday, he was put on waivers by the Ottawa Senators after goaltender Craig Anderson returned from tending to his wife, who was suffering from cancer, and the recent success of backup goaltender Mike Condon. He was reassigned to Binghamton and appeared in just five games before suffering a tear in his right labrum requiring season-ending hip surgery on February 27, 2017.\nLater years (2017–2022).\nHammond returned to full health in time for the 2017–18 season, his final year of contract with the Senators. After clearing waivers, he was assigned by Ottawa following training camp to new AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators on September 29, 2017. On November 5, 2017, Hammond's contract was included by the Senators in a three-way trade with the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Matt Duchene. With the Avalanche already at a surplus with goaltenders, Hammond was announced to remain with the Belleville Senators on loan from Colorado.\nHammond was recalled by the Avalanche on multiple occasions serving as backup through corresponding injuries to Avalanche duo, Semyon Varlamov and Jonathan Bernier. Before making an appearance with the Avalanche, Hammond was placed on the injured reserve after receiving an errant stick on the bench resulting in a concussion in a game against the Vancouver Canucks. Upon his recovery, Hammond was assigned to the Avalanche's AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage on March 23, 2018. He was recalled by the Avalanche and started one game in the regular season, and then appeared in three playoff games, starting two of them.\nAs a free agent from the Avalanche, Hammond opted to continue his career in the Central Division, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract to compete for the backup role with the Minnesota Wild on July 1, 2018.\nHaving left the Wild as a free agent after the conclusion of his contract, Hammond signed a one-year, two-way $700,000 contract with the Buffalo Sabres on July 1, 2019. In the following 2019–20 season, Hammond played exclusively with the Sabres' AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans, matching his previous season total in playing 33 games while posting 16 wins.\nOn December 17, 2020, Hammond was signed as a free agent to return to the Minnesota Wild on a one-year, two-way contract. He was assigned to the Wild's taxi squad on January 13, 2021, and did not appear in a game during the season. On July 27, 2021, Hammond was re-signed by the Wild to a one-year, two-way contract extension.\nIn the following season, Hammond was assigned to the AHL, playing his first professional hockey in over a year by appearing in 11 games with Iowa, posting 6 wins. On February 12, 2022, Hammond was traded by the Wild to the injury-depleted Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Brandon Baddock. Eight days later on February 20, Hammond made his first regular season start in the NHL since March 28, 2018 in a 3–2 shootout victory over the New York Islanders. It was his first win in the NHL since April 9, 2016. He was then chosen to start against his former team, the Senators, marking his return to the Canadian Tire Centre five years after being traded. Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said there was \"a humanity piece\" in the selection. Hammond made 26 saves in a 2–1 victory over the Senators. In his next start, a 5–4 victory over the Calgary Flames, he sustained a lower body injury and was placed on injured reserve on March 4.\nCollecting three wins in four appearances (one of those in relief), Hammond's tenure with the Canadiens ended while in recovery from his injury, after he was dealt at the NHL trade deadline to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Nate Schnarr on March 21, 2022. Canadiens general manager Kent Hughes said that with the return of Jake Allen from injury, he felt that the trade would give Hammond more opportunity to continue in the NHL. Hammond finished out the season with the Devils, but he would later reveal that an ankle injury acquired while in Montreal continued to affect him, and he left the team following the season's end.\nOn September 16, 2022, he signed a one-year contract with Traktor Chelyabinsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Hammond's tenure in the KHL was brief, appearing in two games with Traktor in the 2022–23 season before opting to terminate his contract in order to return to North America on October 20, 2022. On December 19, Hammond announced his retirement from professional hockey, saying \"my career was a series of unbelievable and unexpected memories. I met some of the best people I know and I can honestly say I had the best 'job' in the world.\"\nPersonal life.\nHammond was born in White Rock, British Columbia to Marshall and Sandie Hammond, and grew up in adjacent Surrey. He has a brother, Matt, and a sister, Christine.\nHammond has said that he almost quit hockey on two separate occasions, the first when he was cut after a junior A game in the 2006–07 season, and the second when he was traded from the BCHL's Surrey Eagles mid-season in 2007–08.\nAwards and records.\nSource: AHL"

He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins.\nAmateur career.\nAs an amateur, Thorpe trained at the Melbourne Aces Baseball Academy. He competed in international youth baseball tournaments. In 2011, Thorpe won the \"Golden Arm\" award from the Australian Baseball Federation. In 2012, he signed with the Minnesota Twins, receiving a $500,000 signing bonus.\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota Twins.\nIn the 2013 season, Thorpe made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Twins of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL).

Thorpe made his Australian Baseball League debut with the Aces on 22 November 2013.\nAfter participating in extended spring training, the Twins assigned Thorpe to the Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Class A Midwest League in June 2014, where he became the youngest player in the league. He finished the year with a 3–2 win–loss record and a 3.52 ERA in 16 games started. At the end of the 2014 season, Thorpe was diagnosed with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his pitching elbow.

        "text": "Zakopane 2006 (Podhale Goral: \"Zokopane 2006\") was an unsuccessful bid by Zakopane, Poland, and the Polish Olympic Committee to host the 2006 Winter Olympics. It was one of six candidates, but failed to be short-listed.\nVenues.\nThe proposed venues concept comprised:\nZakopane Cluster.\n- Kiry - biathlon\n- Siwa Polana - cross-country skiing \n- Witów - luge, bobsleigh and skeleton\nEvaluation.\nThe proposed sports concept was considered as good with the most of the venues in the vicinity of Zakopane, close to the main Olympic village. The IOC evaluation report praised the support by both Polish government and the Zakopane residents (in a 1997 referendum held in Zakopane 82.6% replied positively to the question of organising the Games, and 61.6% as its financial implications). Other issues rated favorably were: sufficient experience of Poland's security forces, and winter sports traditions resulted in a good legacy and post-use of the planned venues.\nHowever, the evaluation report listed some problems that might have occurred. The construction of certain facilities, particularly the skiing venues, to be located totally or partially in the Tatra National Park, could have been a big challenge due to its special international ecological status. The most problematic issue was using Kasprowy Wierch as a downhill, super-G, and giant slalom slope. The snowmaking facilities, cable car, lift and spectator capacities were considered insufficient and access to the stadium was non-existent. The proposed men’s downhill course was not approved by International Ski Federation. There were objections among non-governmental organisations, the scientific and intellectuals community to the proposed venues placed in the Biosphere Reserve.\nFurthermore, the Evaluation Commission believed that there was a shortage in accommodation facilities and the general standard of accommodation had to be upgraded. The road between Kraków and Zakopane was rated as insufficient for Games-related traffic. The International Ice Hockey Federation was concerned with the logistics of holding the men’s ice hockey final in Kraków.\nAftermath.\nDuring the 109th IOC meeting held in Seoul the final presentation was headed by Irena Szewińska. The Zakopane bid missed the shortlist.\nAfter selection, Zakopane didn't bid for Olympics, but Kraków bid for 2022 Games included Zakopane as venue for snow sports."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2014 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2014 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nOn February 20, 2014, CoSIDA and \"Capital One\" announced the 2014 Academic All-America team, with Aaron Craft headlining the University Division as the men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.

The three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania chose to compete independently from the Unified Team. The republics of Croatia and Slovenia made their Olympic debuts, being newly independent from Yugoslavia. Following German reunification, the combined Federal Republic of Germany was represented by one combined team.\nGermany was the most successful team at these Olympics, winning 10 gold medals out of 26 total; both were the most of any nation. The Unified Team came in second in both tallies, with 9 golds and 23 total medals – Norway tied the Unified Team with 9 golds, but had only 20 total medals. New Zealand's Annelise Coberger won the country's first Winter Olympics medal, the first by someone representing a Southern Hemisphere nation. Lyubov Yegorova was the most successful athlete, with five medals: three golds and two silvers. Her teammate on the Unified Team and fellow cross-country skier Yelena Välbe also won five medals; she had one gold and four bronze medals. Thirty-eight athletes won more than one medal in Albertville, and twenty NOCs won at least one medal.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who won three or more medals during the 1992 Winter Olympics are listed below."

        "text": "Nathan Paul Harris (born 8 March 1992) is a former New Zealand rugby union player who played as a hooker for in the ITM Cup and the in Super Rugby.\nCareer.\nHarris debuted for Bay of Plenty during the 2012 ITM Cup. He only made a solitary appearance during that campaign, but the following year he established himself as the Steamers' first-choice hooker. Despite a disappointing season for his side in 2013, Harris' individual performances were impressive. Initially, he was not named in any of New Zealand's five Super Rugby franchises squads for the 2014 Super Rugby season. But, the defending champion , who had selected Hika Elliot, Mahonri Schwalger and Rhys Marshall as their hookers were struck with a selection crisis as Elliot and Schwalger went down with injuries prior to the start of the season. This opened the door for Harris to join the Hamilton based outfit on a short-term contract. He made his super rugby debut in week 1 of the season as the Chiefs defeated the in Christchurch.\nInternational career.\nEarly career.\nHarris was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 side which finished as runners-up in the 2012 IRB Junior World Championship in South Africa. Harris was first-choice hooker during the competition, with his back up being future Chiefs teammate Rhys Marshall, who he later backed up. During his time there, it was revealed that he was being investigated by South African police on a rape allegation. Harris maintained ignorance. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing, and South African authorities did not prosecute him.\nHarris made his international debut for New Zealand in round 5 of the 2014 Rugby Championship, replacing the great Keven Mealamu with nine minutes to go. This came after Harris and prop Joe Moody were added to the squad as injury cover. Harris made his first international start in his second test for the All Blacks, scoring the opening try against the United States in the first two minutes. Harris was unfortunately injured ten minutes later, being replaced by Mealamu. The All Blacks went on to demolish the States 74-6.\n2015-2016.\nAfter missing all of international rugby in 2015 due to injury, Harris was re-selected for the All Blacks in the 32-man squad to face Wales in 2016. Harris replaced Dane Coles off the bench in the first and second tests of the series, scoring the winning try of the first test long after the whistle was blown, allowing the All Blacks to win 39-21. Harris only managed 13 minutes of game-time across the series however, due to the dominance of Coles, who was later nominated for World Rugby Player of the Year in 2016. Harris was named to start in the first test of the Bledisloe Cup against Australia that year, but was replaced by Codie Taylor due to snapping his ACL prior to the test. Harris missed the rest of 2016 due to injury.\n2017-2019.\nHarris was selected for the 2017 series against the British and Irish Lions, replacing Codie Taylor in the warm-up 78-0 demolition of Samoa the week before the first test. Harris performed incredibly well throwing the lineout ball, with the All Blacks winning all nine of Harris' throws. This saw Harris chosen to replace Taylor off the bench in all three tests against the Lions. Harris only played 23 minutes of game time across the series unfortunately, with Taylor being one of the standout performers of the series.\nHarris stayed injury-free for the rest of 2017 and played another five times in the year. Harris started against the Barbarians on the end-of-year tour. Despite a great performance for most of the fixture, Harris silenced critics by scoring a great try. Harris was replaced by debutant Asafo Aumua with 12 minutes left. Harris started again on tour against a French XV before making way for Aumua with 14 minutes to go. Harris made two more appearances for the All Blacks on the end-of-year tour, replacing Taylor- the clear first-choice hooker, off the bench in wins against Scotland and Wales.\nHarris replaced Taylor off the bench in the first two tests of the 2018 French series, but missed the third test due to the birth of his first child. Liam Coltman earned a re-call to international rugby in Harris' absence. He played a total of nine tests off the bench in 2018, but with Dane Coles returning from injury, Harris was once again relegated to the third-choice hooker, for the All Blacks, after the end of the 2018 Rugby Championship.\nBreaking his leg during the 2019 Mitre 10 Cup meant that Harris was not considered for selection towards the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nOutside of rugby.\nFrom 2016 to 2022, Harris pursued a Bachelor's degree at the University of Waikato in Health, Sport, and Human Performance. He majored in Sport Development and Coaching, with a minor in Geography.\nIn 2023, Harris was employed as a Physical Education teacher at Pāpāmoa College"

He attended the prestigious Otago Boys' High School in his hometown where he played first XV rugby before going on to study accounting at the University of Otago. After graduating, he split his time working as an accountant with building a rugby career, initially playing for Pirates in Otago's local club rugby competition.\nClub career.\nMillar first broke into the squad for the 2013 ITM Cup and enjoyed a standout debut season, earning 11 caps and scoring 1 try in the process as the Razorbacks reached the Championship semi-finals before going down to .

He made 4 substitute appearances during his first campaign with the Highlanders, not a bad return as he spent the year as the franchise's third choice loosehead behind the more experienced Kane Hames and Chris King.\nUnfortunately for him, all the momentum he had built up in his career through 2013 and the early part of 2014 came to a grinding halt when injury ruled him out of the 2014 New Zealand domestic season and the 2015 Super Rugby season, meaning that Millar would play no part in the Highlanders maiden Super Rugby triumph. He did, however, make a comeback with Otago in the second half of 2015 which earned him a recall to the Highlanders wider training group for the 2016 season and this time serving as back up to Daniel Lienert-Brown and Brendon Edmonds, he managed another 4 substitute appearances.\nTony Brown replaced the bound Jamie Joseph as Highlanders head-coach ahead of the 2017 Super Rugby season and having worked with Millar before at provincial level, he saw fit to promote him to the franchise's senior squad ahead of his first campaign in charge.\nJamie Joseph announced ahead of the 2018 Super Rugby season that Millar will join his Sunwolves squad alongside several former Highlanders teammates."

        "text": "Billy Nicholas Williams (born September 8, 1993), is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League. He was drafted by the Texas Rangers, in the second round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox and in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) for the Hanwha Eagles.\nEarly life.\nWilliams was born and raised in Galveston, Texas. He went to Ball High School in Galveston, graduating in 2012.\nBaseball career.\nTexas Rangers.\nWilliams was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the second round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft out of high school. He had committed to Texas A&amp;M University, but signed with the Rangers for a $500,000 signing bonus.\nHe made his professional debut in 2012 with the Arizona League Rangers, hitting .313/.375/.448 with two home runs in 201 at bats over 48 games. He played the 2013 season with the Hickory Crawdads. He played in 95 games during the season, hitting .293/.337/.543 with 17 home runs, 15 walks, and 110 strikeouts over 376 at bats.\nPrior to the 2014 season, Williams was ranked by \"Baseball America\" as the Rangers fourth-best prospect, and the 97th-best overall in baseball. Playing for three minor league teams in 2014, he hit .283 with 22 walks and 140 strikeouts in 452 at bats. After the season he played for the Surprise Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League, and hit .277 with 1 walk and 32 strikeouts in 112 at bats.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn July 31, 2015, Williams was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Matt Harrison, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff in exchange for Cole Hamels and Jake Diekman.\nIn 2016, in 125 games for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs in the International League in Triple A, Williams batted .258 with 13 home runs and 64 RBIs along with a .287 on-base percentage. He walked 19 times, and struck out 136 times in 497 at bats. That season, Manager Dave Brundage benched him a number of times, for disciplinary reasons ranging from him failing to hustle to him showing up opponents. Williams reacted to his benching by his manager, saying: \"That’s his decision. I can’t do anything about it.\" Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said he was concerned about Williams \"because we’re trying to establish a culture of playing the game the right way and we want players who grind it out, we want players who show energy.\" The Phillies added him to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season.\nIn 2017, he batted .280/.328/.511 with 15 home runs and 44 RBIs for Lehigh Valley, and walked 16 times while striking out 90 times in 282 at bats.\nIn 2019 he batted .316/.381/.574 with 10 home runs and 25 RBIs for Lehigh Valley, and walked 14 times while striking out 52 times in 190 at bats.\nMajor Leagues.\nThe Phillies promoted Williams to the major leagues on June 30, 2017, and Williams made his MLB debut that night. On July 9, Williams hit his first MLB home run off of Trevor Cahill of the Padres. Nine days later, on July 18 Williams hit his first career grand slam against the Brewers. As to his defense in the outfield and baserunning, beat writer Matt Gelb wrote in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\": \"Progress is needed on defense and the bases. Williams has overcome bad reads in the outfield with his speed. But he’s shown cracks there. And, as a baserunner, Williams has committed mental mistakes. His instincts are not the sharpest. Sometimes, raw talent can rise above that.\" He batted .288/.338/.473 for the 2017 season with the Phillies with 12 home runs, one stolen base, and 55 RBIs, and walked 20 times while striking out 97 times in 313 at bats. On defense, he had a -9 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the worst in the National League among right fielders.\nIn 2018 he batted .256/.330/.434, with 16 home runs, 3 stolen bases, 58 RBIs, and 111 strikeouts in 407 at bats. On defense, he had a -15 Defensive Runs Saved rating, the 2nd-worst in the National League among right fielders, behind Bryce Harper.\nIn 2019 he batted .151/.196/.245, with 2 home runs, 5 RBIs, and 43 strikeouts in 106 at bats (striking out 38.4% of the time). His batting average, on base percentage, and OPS (.442) were the lowest of all 219 NL batters who had 100 or more plate appearances, and his strikeout percentage was the highest.\nOn August 11, 2020, Williams was designated for assignment by the Phillies.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn August 15, 2020, Williams was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds and optioned to their alternate training site. On September 15, 2020, Williams was designated for assignment by the Reds without appearing in a game for the club. He became a free agent on November 2, 2020.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn January 15, 2021, Williams signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox organization. He was selected to the major leagues on April 8, 2021, to fill in for the injured Billy Hamilton. That night he was the starting left fielder for the White Sox, playing in his first MLB game since 2019. On April 15, 2021, Williams was designated for assignment after going hitless in 13 plate appearances for the team. On April 17 he was outrighted to the alternate training site. He was released on August 3, 2021, in 126 at bats in AAA he hit .262 with 4 HR and 13 RBIs.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn April 11, 2022, Williams signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League.

He was selected 4th overall in the 2013 PBA draft by Barako Bull.\nAmateur career.\nBefore beginning his college career at Arellano University, Forrester trained at IMG Academy Prep for one year in the United States. During his one-year stay at IMG Academy Prep, Forrester averaged 15.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 2.3 steals per game. Despite being offered a full scholarship to attend and play basketball at the Ateneo De Manila University, Forrester opted to play for the Arellano Chiefs instead.\nCollege career.\nForrester had a brief tenure at Arellano University that lasted only 2 seasons due to his maximum eligibility of 2 years. Unfortunately, his whole college career was filled with inconsistent play and a struggle throughout his whole second season after suffering an injury in preseason play and still continuing to play despite the severity of the injury.\nRookie season.\nForrester joined the Arellano Chiefs in 2012 for the NCAA Season 88 basketball tournament. Forrester's debut performance was against the JRU Heavy Bombers in the Chiefs' third game of the season wherein Forrest tallied 7 points and 5 rebounds in 22 minutes of playing time. In his rookie season, Forrester was a consistent member of the starting lineup for the Chiefs at the small forward position. Forrester scored a career high 28 points in a loss against the San Beda Red Lions, he made 7 three-pointers and grabbed 7 rebounds in 23 minutes of playing time. The Chiefs finished the season with a disappointing win–loss record of 6 wins and 12 losses in which they failed to qualify for the Final Four. Forrester's rookie season had him play 16 games and averaged 23.94 minutes, 12.25 points, 5.06 rebounds and 1.25 steals per game.\nSecond season.\nAfter completing a successful rookie campaign statistically, Forrester was given the honour of being the Chiefs' team captain. However, his final season was filled with inconsistency and a lingering injury that occurred just before the start of NCAA Season 89. The injury he experienced was a meniscal tear in his left knee during a game against Jose Rizal University where he still led the Chiefs with 21 points en route to victory. Even though he was injured, Forrester still played but his average numbers took a drop wherein he averaged 8.4 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 0.9 steals per game in his final season. Overall, the Chiefs' Season 89 campaign ended with no Final Four berth once again and an 8 win-10 loss record. Upon season's end, Forrester graduated from Arellano University and elected to join the 2013 PBA Draft.\nPBA D-League.\nForrester played for the Cagayan Rising Suns for a short period of time and averaged 12.5 points and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting an average of 37% from beyond the arc during his tenure.\nProfessional basketball career.\nPBA draft.\nEntering the 2013 PBA draft, Forrester was projected to be a mid-late first round draft pick. He was eventually selected 4th overall in the 2013 PBA draft by Barako Bull Energy but his draft rights were then traded for by Barangay Ginebra San Miguel. Based on scouting reports, Forrester was described as an athletic wing player with incredible leaping ability and explosiveness which led to his nickname of \"Air Canada\".\nBarangay Ginebra San Miguel (2013–2015).\nHaving played in 10 games for Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, Forrester averaged 5.3 minutes, 1.3 points, 1.2 rebounds and 0.2 steals per game. Forrester plays both the guard and forward positions, and plays alongside Greg Slaughter, the 2013 PBA Draft number 1 draft pick.\nBarako Bull Energy (2015–2016).\nOn March 31, 2015, Forrester, along with Dylan Ababou was traded to Barako Bull Energy in exchange for Barako Bull's first round pick in the 2015 PBA draft (later turned out be Scottie Thompson.\nNLEX Road Warriors (2016).\nOn May 31, 2016, Forrester was traded to NLEX for John Wilson.\nBlackwater Elite (2016-2017).\nOn October 26 2016, Forrester was traded, along with a 2016 second round pick to the Blackwater Elite in exchange for Carlo Lastimosa.\nGlobalPort Batang Pier (2017).\nOn March 29, Forrester was traded, along with Dylan Ababou to the GlobalPort Batang Pier in exchange for KG Canaleta.\nPBA career statistics.\n\"Correct as of September 23, 2016\"\nPersonal life.\nBorn and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Forrester's Filipino heritage came from his mother, Leticia Parinas, who is from Pangasinan."

The team signing the player will lose their first round choice, though the first ten picks are protected. The New York Mets surrendered their first round pick (15th overall) to sign Michael Cuddyer, while the Colorado Rockies gained a supplementary pick. The Toronto Blue Jays lost their pick for signing Russell Martin, giving a compensatory pick to the Pittsburgh Pirates.

        "title": "Rugby Thompson",
        "text": "Rugby Thompson is the second studio album by American rapper Smoke DZA. The album was released on June 19, 2012, by High Times Records and Cinematic Music Group. The album is entirely produced by Harry Fraud. The album features guest appearances from Currensy, Domo Genesis, Schoolboy Q, Sean Price, A$AP Twelvyy, Action Bronson, Thirstin Howl III, NymLo and Meyhem Lauren.\nBackground.\nIn July 2012, in an interview with HipHopDX, Smoke DZA spoke about the album, saying: \"I think [\"Rugby Thompson\" is] a masterpiece. I think it’s the best project I’ve ever put out—lyrically, production-wise, creativity…really it’s just a great piece of work being a Hip Hop lover. Fuck it. You don’t have to smoke weed to enjoy this shit. For me, that’s been the stigma for a lot. People just immediately throw me in the Afroman realm like I’m just this weed guy. In reality, I’m from 119th street and I can really rap. I really do this shit.\" Producer Harry Fraud also spoke about how long it took to complete the album, saying: \"We really only started working on it at New Year’s. And it came out in June. So there hasn’t really been that much time because we worked on it so quick. That’s important, because I kind of feel like we captured that moment for ourselves. And there’s nothing to really look back on and say, “Oh we could’ve done this different,” because it was really all organic and right in the moment. The beats and rhymes were written right there, so it was whatever was coming to us at the time.\"\nCritical reception.\n\"Rugby Thompson\" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 79, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 6 reviews. The Company Man of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \"\"Rugby Thompson\" is a great listen, largely. \"Rivermonts\" and \"Game 7\" feel like filler next to the rest, and \"Lo Horsemen\" is a bit cumbersome for such a clean collaboration. Those aside, Smoke DZA and Harry Fraud deliver a solid collection of songs that grow more interesting on repeated listen, basking in an evolved sound equally representing vintage and avant-garde New York Hip Hop. Welcome to the new era.\" Neil Martinez-Belkin of \"XXL\" gave the album an XL, saying \"DZA and Fraud recorded almost the entirety of \"Rugby Thompson\" together at Fraud’s Brooklyn studio. The rapper/producer tandem has become somewhat of a lost art in an era where entire albums are created via email exchange between rappers and an internet full of hungry beatmakers. But the chemistry between these two is palpable. It reminds of when DZA’s Jet Life compadre, Curren$y, fully came out of his shell with his \"Pilot Talk\" series alongside Ski Beatz. The same might be said about DZA and \"Rugby Thompson\", an album that not only strips him of an unfair “weed rapper” label, but is also probably the best rap album to come out of New York this year.\" Steve Juon of RapReviews gave the album a 6.5 out of 10, saying \"The only impressions I get of Smoke DZA on \"Rugby Thompson\" are that he wants to smoke weed, fuck around, and make tracks with his friends - which when it comes to free mixtapes was perfectly fine. Now that he's charging for it though he should come with a little bit more, especially if he's promising a thematic cinematic album that ultimately doesn't turn out to be either.\"\nPeter Marrack of \"Exclaim!\" gave the album a positive review, saying \"And so, if you want to learn more about a Harlem kid who grew up selling weed and who now dons $1,500 boots he purchased from the Ralph Lauren Mansion in Atlanta, then \"Rugby Thompson\" comes highly recommended. It is a skilfully wrought glimpse into that dream.\" Max August of DJBooth gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \"Nothing on the album is groundbreaking and it won’t go on to sell millions of copies, but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t a worthy piece of musical art. Smoke DZA deserves his place amongst real down-to-earth rappers, he has paid his dues and his hard work and reputation justifies a purchase. So lend an ear and slip into the smoky world of \"Rugby Thompson\".\""

Designed in bronze by Ludvig Brandstrup, it was completed in 1899.\nBackground.\nAfter the port of Altona had been lost to the Germans in the Second Schleswig War in 1864, King Christian IX signed a bill from the Danish Parliament in 1868 for the establishment of a harbour in Esbjerg, thus being recognized as Esbjerg's founder. The statue was commissioned by the city's citizens when the town was raised to the status of a municipal borough in 1899 but the base stood empty until the following year as the result of a strike.\nStatue.\nSeated on his horse with one of its hoofs raised, Christian IX is positioned gazing over the harbour from the centre of the square. The bronze statue was created by Ludvig Brandstrup (1861–1935) who designed a similar work which stands in Slagelse.\nThe base of the statue carries the inscription: \"Til Aere for Byens Grundlaegger rejste Borgere i Esbjerg dette Mindesmaerke\" (In Honour of the founder of the town, the citizens of Esbjerg raised this monument). It also bears the Danish coat of arms with the king's motto \"Med Gud for ære og ret\" (With God for honour and justice)."

        "title": "Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions men's basketball",
        "text": "The Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions men's basketball team (formerly the East Texas State Lions) is the men's intercollegiate basketball program representing Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce. The school competes in the Southland Conference (SLC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The team plays its home games at the University Field House on the university campus in Commerce, Texas. They are currently coached by Jaret von Rosenberg.\nThe Lions were members of the National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) from 1940 to 1952, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1952 to 1982, and joined the NCAA for the 1982–83 season. Between 1982 and 2022, the team competed in the Lone Star Conference of Division II. In 2022, the team joined the Southland Conference in the Division I.\nThe Lions won one NAIA National Championship in the 1954–55 season, 21 Lone Star Conference Championships, and have made National Playoff tournaments 19 times, 11 as a member of the NAIA and eight as a member of the NCAA Division II.\nHistory.\nEarly years and NAIB membership.\nThe men's team was formed in 1916, and then joined the Lone Star Conference (LSC) in 1931 and won their first conference championship under Jules V. Sikes in 1934. Sikes left Commerce to become head football coach at the University of Kansas and returned to Commerce in 1954 as head football coach. Sikes was replaced by S. J. Petty, who led the Lions to an LSC title in 1936. Dennis Vinzant became head coach in 1937 and the team saw its first national tournament in 1940 as they were invited to the NAIB national tournament in Kansas City, losing in the first round to Pittsburg State, 55–33.\nJoining the NAIA.\nThe Lions joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) for Basketball for the 1940–1941 season. Due to World War II breaking out, seasons in the mid 1940s were either shortened or cancelled, and Vinzent stopped coaching Basketball after the 1945 season after notching a 92–60 record and two Lone Star Conference Championships. Darrell Tully assumed head coaching duties and led the Lions to a conference title in 1948 and two appearances in the NAIA postseason playoffs. Milburn Smith led the team to the NAIA National Tournament in 1950 and conference title before becoming the head football coach at the University and having tremendous success. Jack Woodruff coached for one season in 1951 before leaving.\nChampionships under Bob Rogers.\nBob Rogers arrived in Commerce in 1952 and from 1952 to 1956, the Lions had an immense amount of success. Rogers amassed a record of 113–34, Conference Championships in 1953, 1954, and 1955. Additionally, the program went to the NAIA National Tournament all of those years as well. The 1953 team finished in NAIA Final Four, losing to Hamline College and then losing the National third place game to Indiana State University by 3 points. In the 1954 tournament, the Lions defeated North Texas, Portland State, and Geneva College before losing to Southwest Missouri State in overtime. Entering the 1955 tournament, ET finally broke through by sailing through the tournament and defeating Southeastern Oklahoma State University 71–54 in the National Championship Game. It was the final time the Lions would make the National tournament under Rogers, despite having winning records in 1956 and a conference title in 1957 before leaving Commerce to become head coach for Texas A&amp;M University.\nNorman Pilgrim Era.\nNorman Pilgrim became head coach and the Lions had another run of success under his tenure. Pilgrim coached from 1957 to 1967 and he won two Lone Star Conference Championships in 1958 and 1964. The team returned to the NAIA Elite 8 in 1958. In 1964 ET qualified for the postseason yet again, but lost in the NAIA District playoff to St. Mary's. In 1966, the Lions played Texas Western University's (now The University of Texas at El Paso) historic color barrier breaking team. The game was featured in the Walt Disney film \"Glory Road\". This caused controversy as in the film, the East Texas squad and fans were shown to be very hostile to the Texas Western Black players. In reality, the Lions suited up 3 Black players and the game was played in El Paso and resulted in a 73-51 Miner win, rather than the close and tense affair played in Commerce. Pilgrim amassed a 152–126 record before retiring.\nJim Gudger Years.\nFrom 1969 to 1982, Jim Gudger coached the Lions with mostly successful seasons. The team had won the Lone Star Conference 3 times (1974, 1977, 1978) and were selected for the National Tournament times as well. Losing in the first round in 1974, Gudger's 1977 team went to the Elite 8, where they bowed out to Texas Southern. In 1978 the team lost to eventual National Champion Quincy in the NAIA final four, and lost in the first round to St. Mary's in 1979. Gudger retired in 1982 after winning 202 games, second most in program history. 1982 was also the final year the Lions would compete in the NAIA.\nNCAA Membership &amp; Jerry Matthews/Paul Peak Years.\nIn 1982, the East Texas State and Lone Star Conference left the NAIA and joined the NCAA. Jerry Matthews coached from 1983 to 1990, winning 99 games and winning conference championships in 1984 and 1990. Paul Peak coached team from 1991 to 1999. Under Peak, the Lions won the LSC in 1996 and 1998. The team went to the NCAA tournament for the first time since joining the NCAA in 1996, losing to Central Missouri in the First Round. In 1997 the Lions qualified for the NCAA Elite 8 before losing to Northern Kentucky. In 1998 the Lions returned to the NCAA tournament for the third straight year, losing in the first round.\nSam Walker Era.\nPeak's Assistant Coach Sam Walker became Head Coach in 2000. Under Walker, the Lions won 285 games, had 10 winning seasons, and a Lone Star Conference Championship in 2005 and 2015. Walker's 2005 team went to the NCAA Elite 8 and won the Lone Star Conference Championship in 2015 and went back to the NCAA tournament, before losing in the first round to conference foe Angelo State in the NCAA first round. In Walker's final season in 2017, the Lions again qualified for the NCAA Tournament. Walker retired from coaching in 2017 to take another position with the University. His 285 wins make him the winningest coach in program history.\nCurrent Era.\nJaret von Rosenberg became the head coach in 2017.

        "text": "The Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions women's basketball team (formerly the East Texas State Lions) is the women's intercollegiate basketball program representing Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce. The school competes in the Southland Conference (SLC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). For their first 51 years of existence, they competed in the Lone Star Conference of Division II. The A&amp;M–Commerce women's basketball team plays its home games at the University Field House on the university campus in Commerce, Texas. The Lions have won one conference title and has appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2007, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Beginning in 2023, the team will be coached by Valerie King.\nHistory.\nThe women's team was formed in 1971 and played their first season under Susie Knause and finished off with a 10–6 record. The team's best season came in 2006–07 under coach Denny Downing, when the team finished off with a record of 28–9, the team not only won their first (and only) conference title but also advanced to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament only to be eliminated by Clayton State. The 2006-07 team remains as the only team in program history to make it the national tournament. \nIn 2014, the Lady Lions lost two players (Devin Oliver and Aubree Butts) in a tragic car accident in Paris, Texas, and a candlelight service was held at the university to honor the two and a plaque was placed in a park in Rowlett to honor Devin Oliver (who was a Rowlett High School alumni). Since their death, no player on the women's basketball team has worn their jersey numbers (15 and 25). Under head coach Jason Burton, the Lady Lions went to four consecutive NCAA Division II tournaments from 2019 to 2022, however the 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during this same time period they also won two conference championships (2020 and 2021). Valerie King took over as head coach of the Lady Lions basketball team beginning in 2023.\nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA Division II.\nDuring their time in NCAA Division II, the Lions were selected to play in the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament five times. They were selected for the 2020 tournament, but it was not held due to the cancellation of the tournament with the COVID-19 pandemic. They had a combined record of 5–4.\nArena.\nThe A&amp;M-Commerce men and women's basketball teams both share the university field house along with volleyball.

        "title": "Baseball (poker)",
        "text": "Baseball is a variant of stud poker based on the American sport of the same name. Unlike traditional versions of poker, 3's, 4's and 9's hold special value because of their significance in the rules of baseball - three strikes, three outs, four balls, and nine innings.\nRules.\nPlay of the hand, including betting rounds, is the same as seven-card stud, with the added provisions that:\nAs poker author Irwin Steig noted, Baseball is a form of stud \"scorned by purists and avoided by those whose tastes run to more peaceful games ... [it] is the choice of dealers who want sparkling action and big pots.\" \nWith a reasonably large number of players, it typically takes four of a kind of more to win a Baseball hand, and going for straights and flushes is usually futile. When Baseball is played high-low, perfect lows (equating to 6 4 3 2 A) become common and anything less in that direction is likely to lose.\nVariations.\nAny number of variations of Baseball are possible. Limits may be put on the cost of matching the pot. Or the buy-the-pot rule may only be in effect for the first person to receive an open 3; if bought, all open 3's received by anyone from that point on are wild with no further requirements. Or the pot-matching requirement can be omitted altogether and any open 3 is simply wild. \nThe extra card for getting a 4 can be dealt face up rather than face down. Another version of the game also makes face down 4's entitled to an additional card. There are variations as to when the player must announce they have a face down 4, and also whether the additional card should also be face down as a result. Still another variation on the face-down 4's requires the player to \"buy\" the additional card by putting an additional sum into the pot (often a multiple of the minimum bet). In this case, if the player declines to make the additional bet, they do not have to fold, but they do not get the additional card. And yet another flavor has an open 4 not getting an extra card, but rather a replacement for the 4 if the recipient so chooses.\nIf a card is mistakenly dealt before a player has made a decision about a 3 (or, in a variant, a 4), then such a card is considered out of play.\nFootball is an alternative version of Baseball Poker where 3's and 6's are wild and an additional card is drawn if a player is dealt a 2.\nWoolworth is another variant, this time with 5's and 10's being wild, with an additional card awarded for players dealt a 2.\nBlind Baseball is played the same as Baseball Poker, but with nine cards in total instead of seven.\nAnother variant is \"Rainy Day Baseball.\" In this variant, if the Queen of Spades is dealt face-up to any player, then the game is \"rained out.\" All cards are collected and the hand is re-dealt. The pot from the \"rained out\" game carries forward to the winner of the first hand that is not rained out."

        "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball under Adolph Rupp",
        "text": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball under Adolph Rupp covers the history of the University of Kentucky Wildcats college basketball team during the period from when Adolph Rupp was hired as head coach in 1930 through 1972. Under Rupp, Kentucky played as part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Wildcats under Rupp played its home games at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky. During the forty years Rupp has served as head basketball coach, Kentucky compiled an overall official record of 876–190 (), won four NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had six NCAA Final Four appearances, captured twenty-seven Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won thirteen SEC tournaments.\nRupp gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, quickly gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and a fine strategist, often driving his teams to great levels of success.\nYear-by-year results.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFabulous Five.\nThe 1948 Kentucky Wildcats not only won the 1948 NCAA title, but provided the core of the United States 1948 Olympic team that won the gold medal in the London Games. The core of five players that made up the Fabulous Five were Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, Wallace 'Wah Wah' Jones, Cliff Barker and Kenny Rollins.\nA year later in 1949, the same team would win back-to-back champions, making Kentucky only the second team to repeat after Oklahoma A&amp;M (Now Oklahoma State).\nThe Fabulous Five are considered one of the greatest teams in Kentucky basketball history. Over two seasons the Fabulous Five compiled a 68–5 record with two consecutive NCAA Championships.\nPoint Shaving Scandal.\nOn October 20, 1951, former Kentucky players Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season. This game occurred during the same year that Kentucky won their second straight NCAA title under Rupp. Rupp and the university were criticized by the presiding judge, Saul Streit, for creating an atmosphere for the violations to occur and for \"failing in his duty to observe the amateur rules, to build character, and to protect the morals and health of his charges\". Rupp denied any knowledge of the point shaving and no evidence was ever brought against him to show he was connected to the incident in any way.\nAt the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete. As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so. As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that. Echoing Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\"\nA perfect season.\nThe team returned with a vengeance the next year, posting a perfect 25–0 record (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked #1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.\nFiddlin' Five.\nBefore the 1957–58 season began, Coach Adolph Rupp commented about the upcoming season, \"They might be pretty good barnyard fiddlers, but we have a Carnegie Hall schedule, and it will take violinists to play that competition\". When the Wildcats became notorious for, as Rupp put it, \"fiddlin' around and fiddlin' around then finally pulling it out at the end,\" the team was tagged with the nickname \"The Fiddlin' Five.\" The \"Fiddlin' Five\" became Rupp's fourth national championship team when it defeated Elgin Baylor and Seattle in the title game at Louisville's Freedom Hall, 84–72. After the game Rupp said, \"Those boys certainly are not concert violinists, but they sure can fiddle.\"\nRupp's Runts.\nThe last of Rupp's most heralded teams were the Rupp's Runts. With no starter taller than 6'5\", was arguably the most beloved in UK history. Despite its lack of size, it used devastating defensive pressure and a fast-paced offense to take a 27–1 record and top national ranking into the NCAA final against Texas Western (who also finished the season with only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second).\nThe now historic 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas at El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game. Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after recruiting several black players for over six years (Wes Unseld was the first black player to receive a formal scholarship offer in 1964), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, and Anthony Davis.\nRupp Arena.\nAdolph Rupp left a lasting legacy on the Wildcats basketball program. In the fall of 1975 Lexington opened a new basketball arena for the Kentucky basketball program. The Wildcats moved off campus from Memorial Coliseum to Rupp Arena in the downtown metroplex. Appropriately the arena was named after the man that had built the program's tradition in the forty years that he was head coach. With an official capacity of 23,500, it is the largest arena designed specifically for basketball, as well as the largest indoor arena by capacity, in the United States. In Rupp Arena, the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team regularly leads the nation in college basketball home attendance. The arena also regularly hosts NCAA tournament games including as the host of the 1985 NCAA Final Four, won in an upset by eighth-seeded Villanova."

        "title": "Belgium at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "Belgium have appeared in the finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup on 14 occasions, the first being at the first FIFA World Cup in 1930 where they finished in 11th place and played the first ever World Cup match against the United States. The inaugural FIFA World Cup final was officiated by Belgian referee John Langenus.\nTraditionally, Belgium's greatest rival is the Netherlands. The two countries have met each other twice in the history of the FIFA World Cup, with one win for Belgium (USA 1994) and one draw (France 1998). The team that has played the most against Belgium in the finals is the continuum USSR-Russia: five times, with three victories for Belgium and two for the Soviet Union.\nBelgium's best finish in the World Cup is third, at the Russia 2018 tournament. Belgium previously finished fourth in the Mexico 1986 competition.\nFIFA World Cup record.\nBelgian's first five appearances at the FIFA World Cup between 1930 and 1970 were not successful, as they failed to advance beyond the first round. After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, Belgium scored their first two World Cup goals in 1934 against Germany, by virtue of Bernard Voorhoof. However, both in 1934 and 1938 the Red Devils went out with a single loss. In 1954 they held England to a draw (4–4) and in 1970 they achieved their first World Cup win, against El Salvador (3–0).\nBelgium reached six successive World Cups from 1982 through 2002 by playing qualification rounds, a record bettered only by Spain whose 2018 World Cup is their ninth consecutive qualification (a streak going back to 1986). Every other nation with an equal or longer string of appearances has had the streak \"interrupted\" by automatic qualification as the host or the defending champion (the 2006 tournament was the first for which the defending champion does not automatically qualify). On top of that, in that era the Belgian team reached the second phase five out of six times.\nTheir fourth-place finish in the 1986 was their best placement in their World Cup history, until 2018 when they finished third after beating England (2-0) in Saint Petersburg.\n1934 FIFA World Cup.\nThe group stage used in the first World Cup was discarded in favour of a straight knockout tournament.\n1954 FIFA World Cup.\nAccording to journalist Henry Guldemont, some of his Swiss colleagues regarded the 1954 Belgian team as \"favourites for the world title\" after a promising 4–4 opener against England. However, in the second and last group match against Italy, Belgium was defeated 1–4 and was unable to proceed to the finals.\n1982 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the first game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, held at Camp Nou, Belgium celebrated one of their most famous victories: a 0–1 win over defending champions Argentina with a goal by Erwin Vandenbergh. After pushing through to the second group stage of that tournament, Belgium was stunned by a Polish hat-trick from Zbigniew Boniek. The decisive match against the Soviet Union ended in a 0–1 loss.\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nFour years later they achieved their best World Cup run to that point when they placed fourth at Mexico 1986. Picked up as the best third-placed team, in the knockout phase Belgium surprisingly won against favourites Soviet Union after extra time (3–4). Different from the previous World Cup, the Red Devils were able to surmount an opponent's hat-trick (this time from Igor Belanov), something that only Brazil and Austria achieved as well in World Cup history (respectively in 1938 and 1954). Belgium also beat Spain on penalties after a 1–1 draw, but they conceded a 2–0 loss against eventual champions Argentina in the semifinal - both goals scored by football icon Diego Maradona. In the third-place match Belgium lost to France (4–2) after extra time. Captain and midfielder Jan Ceulemans and goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff were the first Belgian players to be selected in the All-Star Team of a World Cup. Enzo Scifo was elected as best young player of the tournament.\n1990 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Belgium survived the group phase by wins against South Korea and Uruguay (2–0 and 3–1). In the second round they did well against England, dominating the match by periods and with Enzo Scifo even hitting the woodwork twice. With a persisting 0–0 penalties seemed unavoidable, but eventually they lost in the last minute of extra time after a \"nearly blind\" volley by David Platt. Scifo was elected as second best player of the 1990 World Cup after Lothar Matthäus.\n1994 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the 1994 FIFA World Cup two 1–0 wins in round 1 against Morocco and the Netherlands were remarkably not enough to finish second, but Belgium advanced as they were among the best four third-placed teams. In the second round they lost to title defenders Germany (3–2). During this last game, the Belgians were frustrated that Swiss referee Kurt Röthlisberger had not awarded them a penalty kick when German defender Thomas Helmer brought down their striker Josip Weber in the penalty area with a bump from behind. After the match, Röthlisberger was sent home. Michel Preud'homme was elected as best goalkeeper of the tournament.\n1998 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1998 Belgium was one of only three teams, along with hosts and eventual world champions France and Italy, not to lose a single game. Three draws in the first round – against Netherlands, Mexico and South Korea – proved not enough to reach the knockout stage. In 1998 Enzo Scifo and Franky Van der Elst appeared in their fourth World Cups, setting a Belgian record.\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nWith two ties, the 2002 FIFA World Cup did not start well for Belgium, but the team improved during the tournament. Captain Marc Wilmots was notable for scoring in every match of the first round. Belgium won the decisive group match against Russia with 3–2 and in the second round they had to play against eventual champions Brazil. In this 1/8th final, referee Peter Prendergast disallowed a headed goal by Wilmots that would have given Belgium a 0–1 lead, after a \"phantom foul\" on Roque Júnior. Eventually Brazil won 2–0, but Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted after this match that Belgium was a tough edge and after the tournament he declared that the match against the Red Devils had been the hardest for Brazil to win. With the World Cup final still to go, the team did win the tournament's fair-play award. Marc Wilmots equalled the record of Enzo Scifo and Franky Van der Elst by appearing in 4 World Cup squads, although he did not play in his first World Cup in 1990. Wilmots also scored his 5th World Cup goal against Russia, which made him Belgium's top scorer in World Cup Finals matches until the 2018 world cup when Romelu Lukaku also scored his 5th World Cup goal.\n2014 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 2014, Belgium started as group favourites and beat all group opponents with the smallest margin. Thereafter, they advanced to the round of 16 and played the United States. The Red Devils needed extra time to proceed to the next stage (2–1), where they faced Argentina. In a balanced quarter-final against the \"Albiceleste\", the World Cup ended for Belgium as they failed to equalize after Gonzalo Higuaín's early goal.\nOverview.\nTournaments.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth place"

The Cardinals selected him in the third round of the 2012 amateur draft after attending Wake Forest University and playing college baseball for the Demon Deacons. He made his major league debut on April 30, 2015.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nCooney attended Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Pitching for Malvern's baseball team, Cooney won the Pennsylvania state championship in 2009. Though Cooney received scholarship offers from Ivy League universities, he chose to enroll at Wake Forest University to play college baseball for the Demon Deacons in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). As a sophomore, Cooney was named to the All-ACC second team. After the 2011 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham Anglers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cardinals chose Cooney in the third round, with the 117th overall selection, of the 2012 MLB Draft. He made his professional debut that year with the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. In 2013, Cooney began the season with the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and was promoted to the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League. The Cardinals invited Cooney to spring training in 2014. With Springfield, he was a mid-season All-Star for the Texas League. Next, Cooney pitched for the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 2014, and opened the season with Memphis in 2015. Entering the 2015 season, \"Baseball America\" rated Cooney as having the best control in the Cardinals organization.\nCooney made his major league debut on April 30, 2015, replacing the injured Adam Wainwright in the Cardinals' starting rotation. Cooney struggled in his debut, and was optioned back to Memphis the next day. On May 17, he was named the PCL Pitcher of the Week after allowing a 0.66 ERA in IP against the New Orleans Zephyrs and Omaha Storm Chasers. He also held batters to a .143 batting average against (7-for-49). In his first 14 starts of the season with Memphis, Cooney completed IP, allowing 27 ER for a 2.74 ERA. He also struck out 63 batters and was 6–4 in won–loss decisions. He was named to the 2015 PCL All-Star squad on July 1. The Cardinals recalled him the next day when they placed outfielder Jon Jay on the disabled list.\nOn July 24 against the Atlanta Braves, Cooney earned his first major league victory by pitching a career-high seven innings in a 4−2 outcome. He had previously received no-decisions in each of his first five major league starts. Further, he had a 12-inning scoreless streak that ended in the sixth inning. The Cardinals withheld Cooney from play for the remainder of the season starting on September 1 due to appendicitis. His major league totals for the season included a 1–0 record, 3.16 ERA, 28 hits, 10 walks allowed and 29 strikeouts in innings.\nPrior to the 2016 season, \"Baseball America\" rated Cooney as the second-best prospect in the Cardinals organization. However, Cooney missed the whole 2016 season due to a shoulder injury.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn November 18, 2016, Cooney was claimed off waivers by the Cleveland Indians. The Indians released Cooney on April 2, 2017. Cooney signed a minor league deal with the Indians on April 6, 2017. He pitched only four games in 2017, with the AZL Indians where he posted a 6.00 ERA, due to injury. He elected free agency following the season on November 6."

Participants must be men born in 1992 to 1995 and men in this age range must participate in this category. It was won by Wout Van Aert of Belgium.\nRace report.\nToon Aerts of Belgium, whose brother Thijs Aerts had become World Champion in the Junior's category the day before, was the first to attack and break open the race. He never got particularly far though. Immediately after that Wout Van Aert, also of Belgium and one of the two favourites for the title, took over the attack and managed to create a gap of about ten seconds. By the end of the first lap he had an advantage of 17 seconds on a group of five riders with in it that other big favourite for the rainbow jersey: Mathieu van der Poel of Netherlands.\nLap two saw more expanding of the gap, partially due to good stopping work in the chasing group of other Belgians Aerts, Michael Vanthourenhout and Laurens Sweeck. By the end of it Vanthourenhout had broken away from that group, getting about ten seconds ahead of them. In the third lap the Belgian dominance grew as Sweeck dropped the others as well. Van Aert finished that lap 34 seconds ahead of Vanthourenhout and 56 seconds ahead of Sweeck. A group of Van der Poel, Aerts and Stan Godrie (Netherlands) followed on a minute of Van Aert.\nThe Dutchmen couldn't keep up with Aerts who then managed to join up with Sweeck. In the background David van der Poel passed his brother Mathieu, even more evidence of the off-day Mathieu experienced. Mathieu found his second wind and managed to catch up to the two Belgians. At the start of the last lap it was clear these three would be the contenders for the bronze medal. In a strong uphill section Van der Poel dropped the two Belgians and secured his bronze medal."

        "text": "This event was held on 2 February 2014 as part of the 2014 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in Hoogerheide, Netherlands. Participants must be men born in 1991 or before. It was won by Zdeněk Štybar of Czech Republic.\nRace report.\nSven Nys of Belgium was the big favourite before the race, having dominated the races of the month leading up to it. Beside him were Lars van der Haar of Netherlands, winner of the World Cup, and Belgian Tom Meeusen, the only one to somewhat keep equal footing to Nys as well as winner of the last World Cup race (where Nys did not participate). Outsiders were Francis Mourey of France as well as other Belgians: Niels Albert, winner in Hoogerheide in the 2009 World Championship, Kevin Pauwels, always good on fast and dry tracks, and Klaas Vantornout, silver medal the year before in Louisville. The big unknown factor was Czech Republic's Zdeněk Štybar. Touted by Nys as being his main opponent, the World Champion of 2010 and 2011 had only taken part in six races during the season and was only taking part in the World Championship as an aside in his preparation for the road season. Due to his bad place in the UCI ranking, Štybar was only placed on the fourth start row.\nThe race started with Mourey immediately trying one of his fast attacks. Behind him the Czech Martin Bína took a tumble, holding up the entire pack, and gave Mourey a few seconds for free which he quickly lost again. Albert had a usual terrible start and never recovered. Štybar on the other hand had an amazing start, joining the head of the race halfway the first lap and, showing off his great form, attacked from the head of the race by the end of the first lap.\nOnly Nys, van der Haar and Mourey were able to follow. Mourey didn't last much longer though, as he got dropped on Štybar's next attack. Van der Haar also had trouble with the pace of the two others and halfway through the race it was clear he too would have to settle with aiming at the podium. Either Nys or Štybar was going to win their third rainbow jersey.\nThey stayed closely together until the second to last lap when Štybar slipped and Nys gained a gap of a few seconds. It didn't last long however as Nys also fell while taking a turn and the two of them went into their last lap together. Štybar managed to get ahead of Nys in a section he knew Nys to be better at. A smart move as it turned out, Nys had to get off his bike after badly taking a turn, giving Štybar a six-second lead. Nys managed to bring that down to four seconds, but then, realizing he wasn't going to close that gap in the final fast section of the race, threw his towel in the ring. Štybar won his third title, Nys was content with what he still achieved at his age.\nMeanwhile, in the back, a lot had happened in the battle for bronze. Van der Haar looked like he would be getting his second bronze in a row for quite a while, but then he got passed by Vantornout who, in his turn, got passed by Pauwels later in the race. Van der Haar dropped even further after that as Meeusen also passed him to take the fifth spot."

        "title": "Yorkshire Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Yorkshire Rugby Football Union is the governing body responsible for rugby union in the historic county of Yorkshire, England. It is one of the constituent bodies of the national Rugby Football Union having formed in 1869, the union was formerly called Yorkshire County Club.\nThe county has won the county championship on 15 occasions, and finished as runners-up on a further eight occasions. The Yorkshire RFU also organises the Yorkshire Cup, which was inaugurated in 1878.\nHistory.\nEarly years of County representative team.\nThe first match arranged for the county of Yorkshire took place in 1870, at Leeds against Lancashire. This match was immediately known as the \"Battle of the Roses\" and was considered the \"blue ribbon\" of Northern rugby football. To be selected to represent the county was an honour bestowed long before the foundation of the Yorkshire RFU and it was seen as \"the high road to International honours\".\nFormation of the Yorkshire Football Union.\nAny form of sporting interest with appeal to a Yorkshireman promptly engenders demand for a match with Lancashire. Before Rugby football had even acquired commonly acceptable laws or pattern of play Yorkshire and Lancashire were eager to compete with each other and from this eagerness grew, in course of time and through disharmonious days, the Rugby Football Unions of Yorkshire and Lancashire.\nA Yorkshireman, J. G. Hudson, was innovator; not of the Yorkshire Rugby Union, but of matches with Lancashire, which originated county Rugby, thereby demanding the creation of county authorities.\nHudson was a founder of the Leeds Athletic Club which was built on the simple basis of a newspaper invitation to play football on Woodhouse Moor \"from 7 to 8 o'clock a.m.\".\nThe Victorian virtue of early rising brought extension of playing hours; morning football came to start at 6.30 a.m.-presumably when daylight permitted-and either the power of the Press or the inherent fascination of the new pastime induced attendances of 500, participants in practice games numbering 60 to 150, all, apparently, served by one ball and goalposts consisting of broom handles identified by fluttering cotton.\nThese practices on Woodhouse Moor were not conducted entirely for their own sake. There were other Northern nurseries of the same, or a similar, game and in 1864 matches were played against Sheffield. Winds of challenge blew across the Pennines; in 1865 Leeds played Manchester.\nThis, of course, was not enough. Yorkshire had to meet Lancashire and at Hudson's instigation they did, so instituting county history in Rugby football.\nThe first Yorkshire authority and the first Yorkshire team were representative of the county only in their representation of Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull and no formal committee was required because no formal business had to be transacted.\nMatch management was by venue, Leeds, Bradford, and Huddersfield finding the grounds and choosing the teams for home matches and Hull undertaking responsibility for away fixtures.\nThe Northern counties are prideful communities and Rugby football quickly extended county pride and loyalties. Yorkshire's founding fathers, spurred by Harry Wharfedale Tennant Garnett of Bradford, wanted county matches to become occasions offering hospitality off the field as well as a contest in sport and to this end preparation was necessary.\nBy 1874 the representatives of Leeds Athletic, Bradford, Huddersfield, Hull and York were meeting as a committee to promote county interests.\nThey were a self-created authority, serving a current need and they sought to be no more than the machinery of a county club as distinct from a union of represented clubs within a geographical and administrative area.\nThe committee of the five held county reins through a period of accumulating discontent as the Rugby game spread and the number of clubs increased. They were challenged in 1880 and, with no great show of enthusiasm, invited two other clubs to join them.\nThey bent further before the wind in 1883 when they proposed a revised constitution, but dismissed a request for county organisation under elected members from Yorkshire clubs within the now established national Rugby Union.\nThey conceded the inevitable in 1888 when the Yorkshire County Club formally became the Yorkshire Rugby Union.\nCounty side.\nThe county side has reached the County Championship Final 23 times, winning the title on 15 occasions.\nHonours.\nFrom 1984 all Championship finals were played at Twickenham Stadium.\nNotable players for the County side.\nSee \nClub sides.\nAmongst the clubs falling within the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union are several clubs of national renown including; Doncaster R.F.C., Hull Ionians, Leeds Tykes, Rotherham R.U.F.C., Wakefield RFC (now non-playing), and Wharfedale R.U.F.C.\nRugby league clubs that were members of the Yorkshire RFU before switching codes during or shortly after the schism include Batley, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hunslet, Hull FC, Hull Kingston Rovers, Keighley, Leeds, Wakefield Trinity and York.\nAffiliated club sides.\nThere are currently 94 clubs affiliated with the Yorkshire RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. These clubs are based in the districts that make up modern Yorkshire - East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nG\nH\nI\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nR\nS\nT\nW\nY\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Yorkshire RFU currently runs the following competitions for club sides based in the districts that make up modern day Yorkshire - East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire:"

        "text": " \nThe 2015 Six Nations Championship, known as the 2015 RBS 6 Nations because of the tournament's sponsorship by the Royal Bank of Scotland, was the 16th series of the Six Nations Championship, the annual rugby union tournament. It was contested by England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Including the competition's previous incarnations as the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship, it was the 121st edition of the tournament.\nIreland retained their title from the previous year, their 13th triumph in the competition. This was the first time that Ireland had retained their title outright since 1949, having shared the 1983 championship with France after winning in 1982. They were the first team to be awarded the redesigned Six Nations trophy introduced for 2015, which featured six sides as opposed to five. \nFixtures.\nThe 2015 Six Nations Championship commenced with a Friday night fixture, once again held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, this time between Wales and England. \nRound 1.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 2.\nNotes:\nRound 3.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 4.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 5.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nBroadcasting.\nIn the United Kingdom, BBC One televised all the matches live, although for viewers in Scotland the week 4 match between Italy and France was shown on BBC Two Scotland.

        "title": "2014–15 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2014–15 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team represented Duke University during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The team played its home games in Durham, North Carolina at Cameron Indoor Stadium, celebrating the arena's 75th anniversary. Mike Krzyzewski led the team as head coach in his 35th season with the Blue Devils. During the season, Krzyzewski became the first head coach in Division I men's basketball history to win 1,000 games. On the court, the team featured All-ACC players Jahlil Okafor, Quinn Cook, and Tyus Jones, with Okafor being named ACC Player of the Year and National Freshman of the Year.\nDuke began the season by winning its first 14 games, the seventh such start in school history. During this stretch, Duke won the 2014 Coaches vs. Cancer Classic, defeating Stanford in the championship game. In ACC play, the Blue Devils finished in 2nd place with a 15–3 conference record. They were ranked in the top 5 of the AP poll for the entire season.\nThe team reached the semifinals of the 2015 ACC tournament before losing to eventual champion Notre Dame. In the NCAA tournament, Duke earned the number 1 seed in the south region, playing its first two games in Charlotte, North Carolina before advancing to the regionals at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. By beating Gonzaga 66–52 in the regional final, Duke advanced to the Final Four at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. The win marked the 16th Final Four appearance in school history. In the National Championship game, the Blue Devils beat the Wisconsin Badgers 68–63, winning a fifth national championship for both Duke and Krzyzewski. Tyus Jones was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nOff season.\nDepartures.\nAfter the 2013–14 season, Duke lost 4 seniors and 2 underclassmen from the squad. The six players leaving the team accounted for over half of the team's scoring and nearly half of the rebounding during the previous year. Among the senior departures were Tyler Thornton, who started 25 games in his senior season, and Andre Dawkins, who was the last remaining member from the 2010 NCAA Championship team. The two underclassmen, Jabari Parker and Rodney Hood, declared for the 2014 NBA draft on consecutive days and were both selected in the 1st round. Parker led the team in points, rebounds, and blocks, with Hood being the second leading scorer on the team.\nIn addition to the player departures, Duke also lost a member of the coaching staff. Associate head coach Steve Wojciechowski left the program to become the head coach of the Marquette Golden Eagles. To replace him, assistant coach Jeff Capel was promoted to associate head coach, and special assistant Jon Scheyer was promoted to assistant coach.\nClass of 2014 signees.\nDuke brought in a recruiting class of four players to join the 2014–15 roster. Guard Grayson Allen was the first to commit, doing so soon after his junior season at Providence School. Throughout the summer of 2013, much of Duke's recruiting efforts were focused on point guard Tyus Jones and Center Jahlil Okafor. Both were consensus top 10 recruits in the class of 2014, with Okafor being named the number one prospect by many major recruiting services. The pair had long been rumored to be planning on committing to the same college in spite of living hundreds of miles apart and the rarity of package deals coming to fruition. That November, the rumors were confirmed when the pair announced their decision during concurrent press conferences. Only a week later, 5-star small forward Justise Winslow announced that he would join the Blue Devils as well. Winslow's commitment gave Duke the number 1 recruiting class of 2014 according to the major recruiting services, the first school other than Kentucky to be ranked #1 in six years. In the spring, all four players were named to the McDonald's All-America team with Allen winning the dunk contest, Jones capturing the skills competition and Okafor earning co-MVP honors for the game. Over the summer of 2014, Duke also added Sean Obi, a transfer from Rice, though he would redshirt during the 2014–15 season due to NCAA rules.\nPreseason.\nExpectations.\nDuke entered the 2014–15 season with high expectations. The combination of freshman talent and veteran leadership led many to put the Blue Devils on the early short list of Final Four contenders. Duke was named the favorite to win the ACC by the media at Operation Basketball, the league's annual media event. Nationally, Duke was ranked #4 and #3 in the preseason polls by the Associated Press and coaches respectively, earning 2 first-place votes in the coaches poll.\nExpectations were just as high inside the program. After a disappointing early exit in the 2014 NCAA tournament, incoming freshman Tyus Jones sent a text message to Coach Krzyzewski saying \"this won’t happen next year\" in reference to the defeat. Senior guard Quinn Cook was preparing to cede his starting point guard role to Jones and transition to shooting guard, a position he had not played regularly in the past. Cook was quick to dismiss any speculation that Jones was coming in to replace him in the lineup, stating that his willingness to change positions was driven by his desire to win. Hanging a banner in Cameron Indoor Stadium, something that requires winning an ACC championship or reaching the Final Four, was a major goal for the team. Cook told the media that \"I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished anything,\" referencing the fact that his previous teams had not raised any banners. Cook proved his work ethic over the summer, remaining in Durham the entire summer to work out. That hard work helped him earn the title of captain prior to the season along with junior Amile Jefferson. Jefferson had his own high expectations for the team, stating that \"our guys have been preparing this summer to do something special.\"\nAwards and watchlists.\nAside from the team expectations, many individuals on the roster were highly praised during the preseason, none more so than freshman center Jahlil Okafor. In preseason interviews, teammates and coaches described Okafor's game as \"dominant\". The national media agreed with that assessment, with CBSSports.com and NBCSports.com naming him preseason player of the year. Additionally, he was named to the preseason All-American team by most major media outlets, including the AP, USBWA and Sporting News. Within the ACC, he was named preseason freshman of the year and was voted on to the preseason All-ACC team at Operation Basketball. Okafor was not the only player to receive high praise heading into the season. Fellow freshman Tyus Jones was named to preseason All-American second team by USA Today and third team by CBSSports.com.\nAdditionally, Okafor and Jones, along with senior Quinn Cook and Freshman Justise Winslow were named to several watch lists for prestigious postseason awards. Duke's three star freshmen were named to the watch list for the Naismith Award, with Okafor and Jones tabbed to the Wooden Award watch list, while Okafor and Winslow were named to the Robertson Trophy watch list. All three freshman made the Tisdale Award watch list, given to the national freshman of the year. Cook and Jones were tabbed for the Cousy Award watch list for best point guard in the nation.\nRoster.\nSemi Ojeleye transfer.\nOn December 14, Duke announced that sophomore forward Semi Ojeleye would leave the program, granting him his full release. Coach Krzyzewski called him \"an excellent student and a great representative of our school and basketball program.\" After a successful high school career, in which he was named the 2013 Parade National Player of the Year, he struggled to find playing time as a freshman, logging only 80 minutes. While he did see the court more as a sophomore, playing 63 minutes through Duke's first 8 games of the year, the vast majority of that playing time came during blowouts at home. He only logged 6 combined minutes in Duke's four games away from Cameron, sitting out games against Stanford and Wisconsin entirely.\nAfter announcing his transfer, he immediately drew interest from several high major programs. He did not spend much time in choosing a program, however, deciding to join SMU and head coach Larry Brown less than two weeks after the initial announcement. His quick decision allowed him to enroll at SMU for the spring semester to begin his NCAA-mandated year in residence before becoming eligible for the spring semester in 2016.\nRasheed Sulaimon dismissal.\nOn January 29, Duke announced that Rasheed Sulaimon had been dismissed from the program. The announcement came as a surprise as there were few warning signs that his status with the team was in question. During his sophomore season, the coaching staff took issue with the way Sulaimon had handled adversity, going as far as benching him for an entire game against Michigan in late 2013. In his junior year, however, there were no outward signs that this was still the case, and he had not been the subject of any publicly disclosed discipline since that game. The only official explanation of the dismissal was a quote from Coach Krzyzewski in the press release stating that Sulaimon had failed to \"consistently live up to the standards required to be a member of our program\". Sulaimon was the first person to be dismissed from the team by Krzyzewski as head coach of Duke. It was also announced that while Sulaimon had been dismissed from the team, he remained a student at the university and was in good academic standing.\nA month later, on March 2, the dismissal came under new scrutiny as Duke's student newspaper, The Chronicle, published accusations that two women had separately claimed that Sulaimon had sexually assaulted them. While the two alleged victims did not come forward directly, multiple participants in the retreats told The Chronicle that accusations were made at the retreats. Further accusations were made in the article claiming that the coaching staff, athletics department, and university administration knew of the allegations for a year prior to Sulaimon's dismissal, and had failed to act. The next day, athletic director Kevin White stated that all accusations of misconduct within the department are referred to the Office of Student Conduct, and that the entire coaching staff has fulfilled their responsibilities. White, and all other Duke faculty and staff declined to address Sulaimon specifically, however, citing FERPA. On March 5, it was revealed by Sulaimon's lawyer that he was not under investigation at the time, but an investigation by the Office of Student Conduct had taken place and been completed in 2014.\nThere was little new information in the following weeks in regards to both dismissal and the allegations. Sports Illustrated had reported that a number of events culminated in his dismissal, and the original Chronicle article on the allegations claimed that Duke's sports information director told the paper on the day of the dismissal that it was multiple actions rather than a single one that led to the dismissal. On April 29, Sulaimon broke his silence in an interview with ESPN’s Jeff Goodman. He confirmed that he had been interviewed by Duke’s Office of Student Conduct during the winter of 2013–14 and again in September 2014, but that the investigation never progressed to a hearing. He also said that he was planning on graduating during the summer and transferring for his final year of eligibility. On May 11, it was announced that Sulaimon would transfer to Maryland to finish his collegiate career.\nSchedule and results.\nExhibitions.\nThe Blue Devils’ season began on October 25 with Countdown to Craziness, Duke's version of Midnight Madness. The event featured a dunk contest, won by redshirt junior Marshall Plumlee, as well as an intra-squad scrimmage. Freshman Jahlil Okafor topped all scorers, tallying 27 points in the 24-minute scrimmage. Duke's first game against outside competition came 10 days later against Livingstone College. The Blue Devils nearly doubled the score of the Blue Bears in a 115–58 victory. Seven of Duke's ten players scored in double figures while point guard Tyus Jones tallied 11 assists. Duke's final exhibition was played against Central Missouri, the defending Division II national champions. The game marked the sixth straight season in which Duke played an exhibition game against the reigning Division II champions. The Blue Devils struggled early, falling behind the Mules 13–7 early before taking control of the game, winning 87–47 behind 17 points from Justise Winslow.\nRegular season.\nNovember.\nDuke hosted its first two games of the year as part of the 2015 Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. The first game, on November 14 against Presbyterian, saw Duke start three freshmen in a season opener for the first time in over 30 years. In spite of the youth, there were no early nerves as Duke raced out to a 38-point halftime lead en route to a 113–44 victory. The 69-point margin of victory was the third largest in Duke history. The next night, the team followed up the win with a 109–59 victory over Fairfield. By scoring over 100 points against the Stags, Duke started the season with consecutive 100-point games for the first time since 1991–92. During the game, Quinn Cook scored his 1,000th career point, becoming the 64th player in Duke history to achieve that mark.\nIn the Champions Classic, the Blue Devils travelled to Indianapolis for their first game of the year against a ranked opponent, #19 Michigan State. Duke's first game away from home proved to be a successful one as Duke scored on the inside and outside, leading the entire way in an 81–71 victory. On the inside, Jahlil Okafor showed off a variety of post moves on his way to 17 points, while on the outside, the team shot 50% from the three-point line. The win improved Duke's record in the event to 3–1, best of the four participating teams.\nOn November 21 and 22, Duke continued its road trip, visiting the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the championship rounds of the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. In the semifinals, Duke played Temple, with the defense leading the way in a 74–54 victory. Duke held the Owls to just 37 percent shooting for the game, while also forcing 17 turnovers. In the finals, Duke met Stanford, led by former Blue Devil Johnny Dawkins. It was the first time Dawkins and Coach K had faced off against each other as head coaches. Defense was once again a big factor as Duke held Stanford to 36 percent from the field on its way to winning the championship by a score of 70–59. Quinn Cook scored 18 points to earn tournament MVP honors, while Jahlil Okafor and Justise Winslow also made the all-tournament team.\nDuke returned home for two games to close out the month. First, Duke cruised to an easy 93–54 win over the Furman Paladins on November 26. The Blue Devils then faced Coach K's former squad, the Army Black Knights, on November 30. Army proved to be a tougher test, pulling within single digits of Duke early in the second half, but Duke pulled away from there, winning 93–73. Overall, Duke finished the month with a 7–0 record, trailing for just 48 seconds combined in those games.\nDecember.\nOn December 3, Duke travelled to Madison, Wisconsin for the ACC–Big Ten Challenge in what would be its toughest test to date, #2 Wisconsin in the Kohl Center. With preseason all-Americans Jahlil Okafor and Frank Kaminsky squaring off in the post, the game was billed as the marquee matchup of the challenge and a potential Final Four preview. The game lived up to the hype, with Duke leading most of the way behind a 22-point effort from Tyus Jones. Wisconsin was able to stay close, however, with major contributions from Kaminsky and Traevon Jackson. In the end, Duke's offense was the difference, shooting over 65 percent from the field in the 80–70 Duke win. It was the first time in the history of the Kohl Center that a visiting team shot over 60 percent from the field. The win helped Duke climb to #2 in the polls, while Jones' performance earned him National Freshman of the Week honors.\nThe Blue Devils would not play again for 12 days due to final exams, with their next contest on December 15 against Elon. The team struggled, committing 17 turnovers in the game and allowing Elon to close within 12 points in the middle of the second half. The team was able to hold off Elon 75–62 largely due to the efforts of Jahlil Okafor. He scored 25 points and grabbed 20 rebounds in the game, becoming the first Duke player since Elton Brand to post 20 and 20 in a game. His performance earned him recognition as the Wayman Tisdale national freshman of the week. Three days later, Duke traveled to New Jersey for a game against the defending National Champion UConn Huskies at the IZOD Center. Despite entering the game with only a 4–3 record, UConn proved to be a formidable opponent, holding the Blue Devils to 37.5% shooting and tying the game early in the second half. Duke was once again able to pull away, however, winning 66–56.\nDuke closed out the calendar year at home with wins over Toledo and Wofford, finishing December with a 12–0 record and maintaining their #2 ranking in the polls.\nJanuary.\nDuke's first game of the new year was also the start of conference play, but the Devils continued their stellar play from December with an 85–62 victory over Boston College. The game featured another big performance from Okafor, scoring 28 points in the game, shooting 14–17 from the foul line, a surprising number given that Okafor was normally about a 50 percent foul shooter. Duke's next game against Wake Forest proved to be the first real chink in the armor for the team. In Duke's first 13 games, the team only trailed for just over 6 minutes combined. In the Wake Forest game, they trailed for over 5 minutes, including a late deficit with just 6 minutes left in the game. Duke would eventually hold on to win 73–65, but the game ended the Blue Devils streak of double-digit wins at 13.\nDuke's struggles would only get worse over the next two games, especially at the defensive end of the floor. Duke's 14 game winning streak to start the year came to an end on January 11 in Raleigh against NC State. The Wolfpack shot over 60% from 3-point range on their way to an 87–75 win. Duke's defensive woes would carry over to their next game against Miami, with the Hurricanes shooting 18–27 in the second half in a 90–74 win at Cameron Indoor Stadium. It was Duke's first loss at home since 2012, breaking a 41-game home winning streak. After the game, Coach K said that he felt that something had been missing with the team since Christmas.\nThe Blue Devils would not have much time to figure out what was missing, as their next game saw the team travel to #6 Louisville. Duke not only had to navigate the prospect of its first 3-game losing streak since 2007, but also a top ten opponent anticipating their first match-up with the Blue Devils as members of the ACC. In response to the struggling defense from the previous 2 games, Coach Krzyzewski employed a surprising tactic for the game, a zone defense. While Duke had not been known for playing much zone under Coach K, the strategy worked, as the Cardinals shot a mere 4–25 from behind the 3 point line. With the offense being paced by Amile Jefferson, who scored a career-high 19 points to go along with 7 rebounds, the Devils earned a 63–52 win on the road.\nAfter returning home for a 79–65 win over Pitt, the Blue Devils embarked on a 3-game road trip to end the month. First up was a trip to New York to face St. John's in Coach Krzyzewski's first attempt to reach 1,000 wins for his career. After a fast start for the Blue Devils, the Red Storm took control of the game, building a 10-point lead in the second half. Sparked by a game-high 22 points from Tyus Jones, along with 17 each for Jahlil Okafor and Quinn Cook, Duke was able to comeback and win by a score of 77–68. The road trip continued to Indiana, where the Blue Devils faced #8 Notre Dame, led by former Duke assistant Mike Brey. Sparked by a double-double from Jerian Grant, the Irish were to defeat the Devils by a score of 77–73. The final game of the road trip pitted Duke against #2 Virginia, who entered the game undefeated. The match-up was also featured on ESPN's College Gameday, the first time the program had ever aired from Virginia's campus. Duke struggled shooting the ball for much of the game, missing on their first 9 3-point attempts to allow Virginia to build an 11-point lead in the middle of the second half. Duke found its offense in the final eight minutes of the game, however, scoring 28 points in just 11 possessions during that span to cap off a 69–63 win.\nFebruary.\nDuke returned home for two games to begin February. In a match up with Georgia Tech, the Blue Devils struggled to a narrow 72–66 victory. Despite leading the entire second half, Duke needed some late free throws from Quinn Cook, part of a 17-point second half performance, to seal the game. With the win, Coach Krzyzewski set the record for most ACC wins, with 423. The next game was a rematch from just 10 days earlier against Notre Dame. The Blue Devils were able to flip the result of the previous loss in South Bend, using an early 43–7 run to win in a rout, 90–60. The loss was the biggest margin of defeat for Notre Dame since 1999.\nResults.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#00009C; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#00009C; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#00009C; color:#FFFFFF;\"| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#00009C; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament"
