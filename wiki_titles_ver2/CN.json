The International Baseball League lasted for 3 seasons before Nilsson handed the rights back over to the Australian Baseball Federation in 2002. Following the collapse there was no professional baseball league until it was announced in 2009 the formation of the new Australian Baseball League starting in 2010.

        "text": "Allan Robert Smith (November 10, 1945 – August 7, 2002) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played nearly 500 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA).\nMinor-pro career.\nSmith began junior hockey in 1961 with the Toronto Marlboros. In 1962 he began playing for the Lakeshore Bruins of the OHA before rejoining the Marlboros in the 1964–65 season.\nLate in the 1965–66 NHL season, Smith played two games with the Toronto Maple Leafs, winning one of them and posting a 1.94 goals against average. In 1966 he was sent to the Maple Leaf farm team in Victoria, British Columbia (also called the Maple Leafs) where he started 56 games. He was moved to the Western Hockey League's Vancouver Canucks for the 1967 playoffs, where he played in 6 games, posting a 2.61 GAA and got one shutout. That year he also appeared in one game for the San Francisco Seals in the WHL playoffs.\nFrom 1967 to 1969 he played 85 games with the Tulsa Oilers, Rochester Americans, and Baltimore Clippers minor league teams before joining the Pittsburgh Penguins, being claimed from the Toronto organization in the NHL Intra-League Draft on June 11, 1969.\nProfessional career.\nSmith started his NHL career with the Toronto Maple Leafs. During the 1965-66 season, Smith had quit the Toronto Marlboros to work for a hospital supply firm. Smith made his NHL debut for the Maple Leafs against the Chicago Black Hawks, when he relieved Gary Smith after 2:15 of play. He backstopped the Leafs to a 3–2 victory and stalled Bobby Hull at 47 goals. Smith was one of five goalies who played for the Maple Leafs during the 1966–67 regular season. He played one more game for the Maple Leafs on December 31, 1966, as part of a 5–1 losing effort against the Black Hawks. Smith was later called up as the back-up to Terry Sawchuk for games four and five of 1967 Stanley Cup Finals, due to an injury to Johnny Bower. Smith qualified to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup, but Toronto left his name off, because he did not play in the playoffs.\nSmith's other brief moment of glory for the Maple Leafs was participating in the 1968 NHL All-Star Game. He played in relief for Bruce Gamble and stopped 13 of 14 shots. He was claimed by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the intraleague draft.\nSmith also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres, Hartford Whalers and Colorado Rockies. One of the most infamous moments of his career came on February 13, 1977, when he quit the Buffalo Sabres. Smith was to replace injured goalie Gerry Desjardins for a game against the Minnesota North Stars, and Buffalo had also called up Don Edwards. Less than an hour before gametime, Buffalo general manager Punch Imlach ordered Sabres coach Floyd Smith to play Edwards instead. After the national anthem, Smith stepped off the bench, saluted Buffalo owners Seymour and Northrup Knox and headed for the dressing room.\nSmith later played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the New England Whalers where he was the WHA's top goaltender in 1978. A third team WHA All-Star for two consecutive years, many people in hockey felt Smith was robbed when snubbed by Team Canada for the 1974 Summit Series between WHA All-Stars and the Soviet Union national team. Overall, his career spanned from 1966 to 1981.\nTransaction history.\nSmith was claimed from Toronto by Pittsburghs in National Hockey League intraleague draft, June 11, 1969, then from Pittsburgh by the Detroit Red Wings in the intraleague draft, June 8, 1971. He was subsequently selected by New England Whalers in 1972 World Hockey Association General Player Draft, February 12, 1972.\nSmith was traded by the Red Wings to Buffalo for future considerations, March 10, 1975, then signed as free agent by New England August 15, 1977. His National Hockey League rights were retained by Whalers prior to the expansion draft, June 9, 1979. Finally he was traded by Whalers to the Colorado Rockies for cash, September 4, 1980.\nPost-career.\nIn 1981, Smith played 37 games for the Colorado Rockies and retired. He became a car salesman in Vancouver, and later headed to the British Columbia interior to pick fruit. Before returning to Toronto, Smith also was a salesman for Reuters.\nSmith kept in touch with former WHA teammate Larry Pleau. When Pleau coached the Hartford Whalers in the NHL, he would leave Smith tickets at Maple Leaf Gardens.\nOnce he returned to Toronto, Smith engaged in his love of writing. Subjects would include sports, such as in his 1997 novel \"The Parade has Passed\", featuring a WHA forward who hitchhikes to the funeral of his former coach, who had died in a brawl. Smith later wrote the play \"Confessions to Anne Sexton\" and the beginnings of a novel entitled, \"The Tragedy of Lake Tuscarora\". To make ends meet, Smith became a taxi driver for Beck Taxi. It was not uncommon for Smith to pick up old friends and former teammates.\nIn 1998, Smith used the $34,000 of pension benefits he'd received as part of the NHL's settlement with former players to produce \"Confessions to Anne Sexton\" at the Alumnae Theatre on Berkeley Street in downtown Toronto. The play was about a former goalie who goes to New York City to attend an Impressionist art exhibit. On opening night, seventeen people attended the performance, the biggest house of the show's three-week run.\nIn the last few months of his life, Smith socialized with Jim Keon, the brother of Smith's former teammate Dave Keon. Before his death, Smith was still working on \"The Tragedy of Lake Tuscarora\". Smith's son Adam said that his father was not a talented writer, and after reading the manuscript told his father on his deathbed that there were fourteen pages that were perfect and Smith was happy.\nHe died in 2002 as a result of pancreatic cancer.\nAwards and honours.\nAccolades:"

The award is named in honor of the late Hal Schram, a sports writer at the \"Detroit Free Press\" who covered high school sports for 40 years before retiring in 1983.\nThe award has been given since 1981 by the Basketball Coaches Association of Michigan (BCAM). Most of the award winners have gone on to play at the highest levels of college basketball, and many have gone on to play in the National Basketball Association.\nVoting is done on a points system. Each voter selects first, second, and third-place votes. A player receives five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The player who receives the most points receives the award. Only \"actively coaching\" BCAM members can vote. Beginning for the 2007 award, votes may only be cast for a predetermined group of five finalists, whereas in the past, the pool was unlimited.\nRetro Mr. Basketball winners.\nIn 2010, the BCAM began a 10-year project to honor 'high school senior' boys basketball players from the period prior to the inception of the Mr. Basketball award. The initial awards were announced for players for the years ending in xxx0 - 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970 and 1980. In 2011, awards for next six corresponding 'seniors' for years ending in xxx1 - 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, and 1971 - were named. This pattern continued through the year 2019 when the final award winners were selected for the seasons ending in xxx9."

He made it for a third time in 2004, but found himself 2–0 down in sets against Steve Coote. However, Robson recovered and took the match to a sudden death deciding leg, which he won. Bobby George commented that \"you won't see browner darts in this tournament than that match\". Robson had another excellent performance in losing to 'Silverback' Tony O'Shea in the second round.\nRobson's biggest tournament win so far was at the World Darts Trophy in Utrecht, Netherlands. He beat Mervyn King 6–4 in the 2005 final, averaging 91.5 for three darts, which was a fair way below his averages during his aforementioned performances in the 2004 World Championship.\nRobson had to wait until 2007 to win another match at the World Championship, but his opponent for that match was pre-tournament favourite Michael van Gerwen. Robson won 3–2, although the teenage van Gerwen was not quite at his best form and looked nervous on some doubles. Robson did not have to wait long for his next win, as he made the quarter-finals for the first time in his career with a superb 4–3 win over former champion John Walton, having been 3–1 down. Robson could have had a nine-dart leg, but missed his seventh treble. However, his run was ended by Dutchman Niels de Ruiter. Robson led 2–0 and 4–2 but ended up losing 5–4. This match included a leg which Tony Green and John Part touted as \"probably the best in thirty years\", which Robson won to take the fifth set and lead 3–2.\nRobson returned to the World Championship in 2008 where he was drawn against 2002 World Champion, Tony David. This was Robson's only win at the 2008 World Championship, as in the second round he came up against an in-form Darryl Fitton. Fitton averaged over 100 in a 4–0 victory.\nIn the 2009 World Championship, Robson reached the quarter-final for the second time, beating Stephen Bunting and Martin Atkins before losing to Martin Adams. 2009 was not a good year for Robson as a whole and as a result, he was forced to qualify for the 2010 Lakeside World Championship.\nRobson lost 3–0 in a first round clash with 2009 champion and 5th seed Ted Hankey at the 2010 BDO World Championship. The next year, Robson was seeded once more and cruised through to the quarter-finals for a third time by defeating Steve Douglas and Dave Chisnall for the loss of just one set. He then led Martin Phillips 3–1 but was once again defeated 5–4.\nRobson was knocked out of the 2012 World Championships in the first round losing 3–0 to Steve Douglas\nGary was again knocked out in the first round in 2013 this time losing 3–1 to Garry Thompson\nPDC.\nHe competed for a tour card at the 2020 Q school in an attempt to join the Professional Darts Corporation, however he finished 164th and failed to win a tour card.

        "title": "Littlehampton, Clapham and Patching Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Littlehampton, Clapham and Patching Cricket Club is a cricket club in Littlehampton, West Sussex, England.\nThe earliest record of cricket in Littlehampton was of a game on 2 July 1802 on the Littlehampton Green when a match between the Gentlemen of Sussex and the Storrington Club was played. On 3 June 1813 a team from Littlehampton played a team from Lancing and in 1816 the residents played a visitors’ side. By the end of the 1860s an occasional cricket ground was on the Common immediately south of the Roman Catholic Church, where there was ‘a level plateau of perfectly natural formation’, known locally as “The Cow Ground”.\nGeneral.\nThe Littlehampton, Clapham &amp; Patching Cricket Club is a member of the Sussex Cricket League, which administers the Sussex Premier League. After being relegated in 2012 they spent four years in the West Sussex Invitation League. In 2017 the 1st XI won Division 1 on the last day of the season against rivals Arundel CC to gain promotion back into the Sussex Cricket League. There are Sunday XI’s that play friendly cricket.\nRecently after a period of consolidation LC&amp;PCC has begun gain success. In 2016 the 1st XI won the West Sussex Invitation Cricket League T20 Competition. Also in 2016 the 3rd XI won division 7 on last day of the season backing up their title of division 8 in 2014, while the 2nd XI won the West Sussex Invitation League Division 6 in 2015. Off the field the club were awarded a grant in 2015, to redevelop the Old Pavilion which has now been renamed The Somerset Pavilion.\nThe Club also entertain a number of mid-week touring sides.\nThe former Littlehampton Cricket Club won the Sussex Championship League in 1975 and 1977 and was the runner-up in 1976. After this success the Club was accepted into the Sussex Cricket League in 1978. The Club won the Sussex League Cup in 1989 and was the runner-up in 1984. The 1st XI was the League runner-up in 1991 and the 2nd XI achieved this distinction in 1977. In 2003 the 2nd XI won the Division 1 of 2nd XIs and secured promotion. The 1st XI was promoted at the end of the 2004 season.\nThe former Clapham and Patching Cricket Club was the runner-up in Division 2 of the Sussex Championship League in 1993 and was also the runner-up in the Sussex Championship League Cup in the same year.\nIn addition, the Club plays in the Worthing and District Knock Out Cup – an evening competition and has been the winner of this Cup on several occasions. The Club has also entered six-a-side teams in the Worthing and Bognor Regis indoor cricket competitions. The Club is the most successful local side by far in these indoor contests and has numerous trophy wins over the past thirty years.\nDuring the 2005 season the club secured the services of Chris Cooke as their overseas player who later signed a contract with Glamorgan CCC.\nFormation of the Club.\nThe first record of the formation of a Littlehampton Cricket Club came from the \"West Sussex Gazette\" of 29 September 1859 when it was reported – “This is the first season of the Littlehamptonites forming a cricket club, they have played eight matches.” However, there were few reports of subsequent matches, which indicated that the Club had ceased to exist by 1866.\nReformation of the Club.\nOn 15 December 1870 the same paper reported that cricket enthusiasts had got together to form a cricket club for 1871 under the presidency of the Reverend W. B. Philpott. The Duke of Norfolk favourably received an application for the cricket ground on the Common to be permanently established.\nIn 1873 notice was received from the Duke of Norfolk’s Arundel Estate Office that the cricket pitch on the Common would no longer be available. Arrangements were made in 1875, with the Duke, to rent a field of six acres (2.4 hectares) at the rear of Selborne Road.\nCricket at the Sportsfield.\nThe \"West Sussex Gazette\" reported on 20 May 1897\n“The Duke of Norfolk has just offered the town the waterworks field as a gift in commemoration of Her Majesty’s reign, to be used as a public recreation and pleasure ground. As it is proposed the present cricket ground (Selborne Road) will before very long be required for building purposes, the acquisition of the new ground will be greatly appreciated.” \nThe 200 year Sportsfield lease stated – “The Duke has decided to substitute another Field for the said Cricket Field and to vest the same in Trustees for the purpose of Cricket, Football and other sports.” At a meeting in February 1898 it was proposed that the Littlehampton Cricket Club, the Littlehampton Association Football Club, the Littlehampton Swifts Football Club and the Littlehampton Athletic and Cycling Sports Club use the ground.\nThe ground was prepared for sports with fencing and a pavilion provided in time for the 1900 cricket season. The official opening of the ground was performed by Lady Mary Howard, sister of the Duke of Norfolk, and was commemorated with a two-day cricket match between the Gentlemen of Sussex and the Players of Sussex. The game was drawn.\nIn 1939 the \"Littlehampton Gazette\" reported that the Duke of Norfolk “has decided that the general interest and progress of the town can best be served by the transfer of ownership to those who can give undivided attention to it and are able to carry out expansion on the best lines”. The Sportsfield formed part of the estate of the Duke. In 1940 the sale was confirmed with a private trust company.\nEarly, in 1962, after previously changing hands a number of times, the Sportsfield was conveyed to Ortem Estates Limited as part of a transaction involving the acquisition of the Beaumont Estate for residential development. On 29 March 1962 the freehold was sold on to Trustees appointed by the Littlehampton Cricket Club for the sum of £10. The\" West Sussex Gazette\" reported – “Littlehampton Cricket Club has bought the freehold of the Sportsfield and so ensured that the ground will remain the town’s sports’ centre for all times.” The successor Trustees, appointed in accordance with the terms of the original lease in 1894, were not affected by the purchase. They would continue to be responsible for the administration and maintenance of the ground until the lease terminated in the year 2087 unless the Sportsfield Trustees decided that they could not run the ground. In that case the control of the Sportsfield would be passed to the Cricket Club.\nCricket in Clapham and Patching.\nThe first reference relating to cricket being played by Patching was reported in the Sussex Weekly Advertiser on 22 July 1771 when Hurst played Patching and Portslade at Hurstpierpoint. Clapham and Patching were the runners-up in the Nind Challenge Trophy in 1897. The trophy had been presented by Mr. P.W.Nind for the East Preston Cricket League. Clapham and Patching Cricket Club remained a difficult side to beat into the early 1900s. In 1914 the Club played in the six-a-side Blauw Tournament at East Preston when the performances of Arthur William Fitzroy Somerset and Arthur Plantaganet Francis Cecil Somerset brought about a win for Clapham and Patching. The organisers took exception to this and the Competition was not repeated again for over half a Century.\nIn the 1930s the Club, which was then known as Patching and Clapham Cricket Club, was linked with the former Durrington Cricket Club and played on a pitch behind the Coach and Horses and used a Southdown Coach as a pavilion. During the course of the Second World War the pitch at Frog’s Hole, Clapham deteriorated into an overgrown field and it took two weeks to relocate the cricket square. The Club constructed a hut to use as a pavilion and this existed until 1978 when the Village Hall was constructed. The freehold of the Ground was owned by the Duke of Norfolk’s Estate and when offered to the Club for £11,000 in 1974 the Chairman rejected the offer without consulting the Club Committee. The Village Hall Management Committee purchased the ground with a covenant that safeguarded the future of cricket at Frog’s Hole in perpetuity.\nThe village pitch name, Frog's Hole, relates to the large number of frogs that inhabited the wet surroundings. Some romantics have erroneously suggested that the name derives from a nearby prisoner of war camp that existed for the French soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars.\nClub Merging.\nIn 1999, the Clapham and Patching Cricket Club merged with the Littlehampton Club which not only secured the future of the village Club but also enabled the new Club to field a 4th XI on Saturdays and consistently to field two Sunday XIs."

        "text": "Ramon Asa Mears (November 8, 1926 – June 11, 2007) was an American college basketball coach. He served as the head basketball coach at Wittenberg University from 1956 to 1962 and the University of Tennessee from 1962 to 1977. His career record of 399–135 (.747) still ranks among the top 15 all-time NCAA coaching records for those with a minimum of 10 seasons. Mears is largely regarded as the father of Tennessee Volunteers basketball, and was known for his trademark orange blazer, which he wore during games. Mears is also credited with coining the phrase \"Big Orange Country.\" Mears was born in Dover, Ohio and was married to the former Dana Davis. They had three sons: Steve, Mike, and Matt. Ray Mears Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee, the city where he died, is named for him.\nEarly years.\nMears played college basketball at Miami University as a walk-on, graduating from there in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in education. He was also a member of the Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. He earned his master's degree at Kent State University while coaching at West Tech High School in Cleveland, Ohio. He is a member of the Miami University Athletics Hall of Fame and contributed to Miami University's national reputation as the \"Cradle of Coaches.\"\nCoaching start.\nMears first coached at Cadiz High School in Harrison County, Ohio in 1949, where he doubled as head basketball coach and assistant football coach. In 1950, he left Cadiz for a two-year stint in the United States Army, returning to the head basketball coaching position at West Tech in 1952. That team won the district championship and finished second in the city of Cleveland. Mears spent four successful years at West Tech.\nMears next moved to Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio as head basketball coach, assistant football, and head tennis coach. In six seasons at Wittenberg, he led the Tigers to four Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) titles and a 121–23 record. It was at Wittenberg where Mears developed his reputation as a great teacher of team defense. For three seasons, Wittenberg was ranked No. 1 in defense in the country and produced two first-team All-Americans. In 1960–61, the Tigers won the NCAA College Division basketball tournament. Mears was named the Ohio Coach of the Year in 1960.\nThe move to \"Big Orange Country\".\nFrom Wittenberg, the 35-year-old Mears traveled to the University of Tennessee, becoming one of the NCAA's most successful coaches during his 15-year stint there. He compiled three Southeastern Conference championships between 1962 and 1977 and an overall winning percentage of .713. Mears was twice named the SEC Coach of the Year in 1967 and 1977. He coached 12 All-Americans at UT, including NBA stars Bernard King and Ernie Grunfeld.\nAfter King and Grunfeld left in 1977, Mears, who had battled depression for several years, sat out the 1977–78 season. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11–16 record, and Mears officially retired due to health reasons after the season.\nHe retired in 1977 after 21 years of college coaching and a 399–135 record with no losing seasons and a .747 winning percentage. After leaving coaching, he served for 10 years as athletic director at the University of Tennessee at Martin (UT-Martin).\nOne of the prime achievements of Mears' tenure at Tennessee was the introduction of the phrase \"Big Orange Country\" to the Volunteer fans. Before his arrival, Tennessee fans almost never wore orange away from the field or court. As an Ohio native, Mears recalled the Steubenville \"Big Red\" and liked the name and all it implied. The Volunteers, Knoxville, and the rest of the state took the concept to heart.\nIndeed, years later, longtime Vols radio voice John Ward said that many of Tennessee's athletic traditions originated with Mears. For instance, the longstanding tradition of the football team running through a \"Power T\" formed by the Pride of the Southland Band originated with Mears having the basketball team run through a giant \"T\" as they took the court. He was also responsible for \"Rocky Top\" becoming Tennessee's de facto secondary fight song.\nMears was also known for his innovative pregame shows. Mears would often, particularly for important away games, walk the perimeter of the floor in his Big Orange sportcoat, both engaging and enraging opposing teams' fans. He also demanded green jello for his pre-game meal. One time before an away game, Mears and the team were eating at a restaurant and the restaurant, as a joke, served Mears orange jello. The coach became quite angry and demanded the restaurant serve him his customary green jello. They did (at great trouble to their staff) and UT narrowly won the game. Afterward, Mears attributed the victory to the green jello."

He played college football for the Arkansas Razorbacks.\nEarly life.\nIn high school at Cross County High, Martin led his team to an undefeated record as a Senior. \nCollege.\nHe attended the University of Arkansas and finished his career with 37 TFL and 25.5 sacks. His TFL (Tackles For Loss) rank 3rd and his sacks rank 1st in school history.\nMartin was a first-team All-Southwest Conference selection in 1988, as well as an All-American, anchoring the Razorbacks defense that helped win the 1988 SWC championship, finishing 10-2 on the season.\nProfessional career.\nHe was selected by the Saints in the first round of the 1989 NFL draft. Very athletic with great length and solid strength at the point of attack, Martin proved to be a fixture on the Saints defensive front. An ironman, Martin only missed 1 game in 11 seasons. He started 144 straight games.\nMartin amassed a total of 82.5 quarterback sacks, which currently stands as the 3rd most career sacks with the Saints behind current star Defensive End Cameron Jordan and linebacker teammate Rickey Jackson. Martin was inducted into the \"New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame\" in 2003 with Jim Dombrowski.\nMartin wore uniform number 93.\nMartin, known as being quiet and reserved, missed the Pro Bowl after the 1992 season having racked up 15.5 sacks. Martin led the NFC in sacks in 1995. Martin earned $22.8 million during his 11 seasons with the Saints.\nMartin was able to produce four consecutive 10+ sack seasons. He reached that milestone during the 1994-1997 seasons, respectively. After another uncharacteristic subpar 1999-2000 season totaling under 7 sacks consecutive seasons (1998-1999), (1999-2000), he was asked to take a pay cut by a new Saints staff headed by coach Jim Haslett. Martin retired shortly thereafter.\nPersonal life.\nMartin's son, Wayne Martin Jr. won the 2011 Florida High School Coaches Association 2A player of the year as a senior at Providence School of Jacksonville. Wayne Jr. went on to accept a full basketball scholarship to UCF, where he played for one season before transferring to Southeast Missouri State University in 2012. He was dismissed from the team for violating team rules in 2013.\nMartin's younger brother, Jeff Martin, was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round of the 1989 NBA Draft. Two months prior, the elder Martin was selected in the 1989 NFL Draft."

        "title": "Tree cricket",
        "text": "Tree crickets are insects of the order Orthoptera. These crickets are in the subfamily Oecanthinae of the family Gryllidae.\nDescription.\nTree crickets as well as most other crickets have two pairs of wings. The fore wings are located closer to the head and are hard and leathery in appearance. The hind wings are located aft of the fore wings and are the wings it uses for flight. When the cricket is not in flight the fore wings fold back to cover the hind wings. The bodies of tree crickets are long and skinny with a coloration that matches their habitat. They have large powerful legs used for jumping. Their heads contain two antennae which can sense both touch and odor and compound eyes which are inherent in all Orthoptera.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThey live in trees and shrubs, for which they are well camouflaged. These crickets are nocturnal and can be found on every continent except Antarctica.\nIn Europe, tree crickets have been expanding northwards and had reached the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands by 2010. In August 2015, the first population was found in mainland England at Dungeness in Kent, where hundreds of males were present.\nTribes and genera.\nThree tribes, containing about 25 genera, have been identified in the subfamily Oecanthinae:\nOecanthini.\nAuth.: Blanchard, 1845\nParoecanthini.\nAuth.: Gorochov, 1986 – Central &amp; South America; Java\nXabeini.\nAuth.: Vickery &amp; Kevan, 1983\nCommunication.\nLike other species of cricket they produce their calling song by rubbing the ridges of their wings together. The chirp (or trill) of a tree cricket is long and continuous and can sometimes be mistaken for the call of a cicada or certain species of frogs. While male tree crickets have the ability to call, females lack the ability. This call is then received by other tree crickets in the area through a system called sender-receiver matching. For example, a male tree cricket will produce a mating call at a specific range of frequencies. This allows females to be able to pick out the males mating call without becoming distracted or confused by other calls from other species of insects. This range of frequencies is called a carrier frequency. Tree crickets are unique in the way they use carrier frequencies because the range of frequencies changes according to the temperature. Due to this, female tree crickets have tympanum (hearing organs) that can receive a much wider range of frequencies than most other insects. Female tree crickets seem to prefer calls at the lower range of frequencies indicating the presence of a large male. This preference for larger males could be because larger males produce a greater amount of sperm thus increasing the females chances of offspring. Some male tree crickets produce a sound that is too quiet to be audible; they amplify their mating call by making a \"megaphone\" type structure from tree leaves.\nDiet.\nTree crickets are omnivorous, and are known to feed on plant parts, other insects such as Sternorrhyncha, and even fungi.\nMating.\nTree crickets exhibit a behavior called courtship feeding. Shortly after copulation the male tree cricket secretes a fluid from the metanotal gland located between its wings in the thoracic cavity. This fluid provides the female with nutrients that help to increase the chances of reproduction. Female tree crickets have even been known to steal this fluid from a mating pair during copulation or finish consuming the fluid if the first female dismounts and leaves. After mating a male cannot mate again until after 30 to 60 min allowing the production of another spermatophere. Eggs are laid in the fall, in a series of small holes drilled into the bark. After remaining dormant for the winter, the eggs hatch in the spring and the young tree crickets begin feeding on aphids. They may go through as many as twelve molts before reaching maturity around mid summer.\nCultural associations.\nThe snowy tree cricket (\"Oecanthus fultoni\" is known for having a chirping rate highly correlated with ambient temperature. This relationship is known as Dolbear's Law."

Thomson described the series as \"a rubber more exciting than any in history except the Australia v West Indies series in 1960–61\". Australia had won the previous three Test rubbers between the two countries, and now won their fourth successive series, by two matches to one with two draws. In the process they \"beat the records of all their predecessors in the country\" by losing only two of 39 matches during the tour, their defeats being against England in the Fifth Test and in the first of their two fixtures against Yorkshire. The remaining 37 matches gave 23 wins for Australia and 14 draws.\nFollowing the tour, three of the Australians — Victor Trumper, Warwick Armstrong and Jim Kelly — were named Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1903, with their captain Joe Darling already having been bestowed that honour in 1900. The Australians' leading batsman, Victor Trumper, made more first class runs than anyone in the season, and of batsman with more than 1,000 runs only Arthur Shrewsbury scored his at a higher average. His 2,570 runs was a new record for any Australian in England. Harry Altham wrote: \"From start to finish of the season, on every sort of wicket, against every sort of bowling, Trumper entranced the eye, inspired his side, demoralized his enemies, and made run-getting appear the easiest thing in the world.\"\nBackground.\nAustralia had won their three previous Test series against England and thus were the holders of the Ashes. The most recent series had been played in Australia only a few months earlier, and the home side had won it by the wide margin of four matches to one. However five leading English players – George Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes, K.S. Ranjitsinjhi, Stanley Jackson and C.B. Fry – had been unavailable.\nAustralian touring party.\nKey: RHB: right-handed batsman; LHB: left-handed batsman; RA: right-arm bowler.\nThe manager was Major Ben Wardill, while the team's \"medical advisor\" was Dr. Rowley Pope.\nMatches.\n5–7 May: London County v Australians.\nAustralians (117 and 213/7) drew with London County (235)\nThe London County Cricket Club, founded in 1899, faced the Australians for the first time, having played touring teams from the West Indies, South Africa and Netherlands in preceding seasons. Rain delayed play at the Crystal Palace Park on the first day, but when it began the South African Test bowler Charlie Llewellyn took five wickets, bowling unchanged through the Australians' innings. Captain W. G. Grace ended the innings, and was then bowled by Monty Noble with two runs on the scoreboard. However, after Len Braund's 140-minute hundred, London County had made 235, and Llewellyn took two more wickets with the new ball as the Australians found themselves at 16 for two. However, opener Victor Trumper made 64 and captain Joe Darling 92, as the Australians led by 85 runs with three wickets in hand overnight. A further ten runs were added in the 15 minutes of play on the final day, as the game was drawn.\n8–10 May: Nottinghamshire v Australians.\nAustralians (474) beat Nottinghamshire (287 and 183) by an innings and four runs\nNottinghamshire won the toss at Trent Bridge and batted through the first day to make 287. The Australians lost their first five wickets for 137, but Darling, batting at number five, made the Australians' first hundred of the tour. His innings of five hours lasted into the third day. The seventh-wicket stand with Bert Hopkins was worth 131 runs, and the eighth-wicket stand with wicketkeeper Jim Kelly a further 119. The Australians made 474, before Warwick Armstrong took career-best figures of eight for 47 as the hosts were bowled out for 183 to secure the Australians' first win on tour.\n12–14 May: Surrey v Australians.\nAustralians (296/5d) beat Surrey (96 &amp; 122) by an innings and 78 runs\nEighty minutes of play was possible on the first day, in which Trumper made his way to 47 not out and Surrey's Tom Richardson took the only wicket. Play was further delayed on the second day, which had the Prince of Wales among the attendance at The Oval. Trumper converted his 47 into 101, and Noble and Armstrong put on an unbeaten stand of 80 before the Australians declared. Surrey were 18 for nought overnight, but lost all twenty wickets on the final day, with Bill Howell taking a match haul of eleven for 56 from 30 overs.\n15–17 May: Essex v Australians.\nEssex (178 &amp; 13/2) drew with Australians (249/8d)\nAt Leyton, the Australians drew with Essex in a match affected by the weather. Percy Perrin hit 63 on the first day, when Essex reached 178, and on the second day only 70 minutes of play was possible, as the Australians reached 59 for one. On the third day, Australia took a lead of 61 before declaring in the afternoon, but after seven overs had yielded two wickets, play was abandoned.\n19–21 May: Leicestershire v Australians.\nAustralians (126 &amp; 69/3) beat Leicestershire (51 &amp; 143) by seven wickets\nErnie Jones and Monty Noble bowled out Leicestershire for 51 in 35.1 overs at Aylestone Road after they chose to bat, but Leicestershire bowler Arthur Woodcock replied with three wickets in four balls, and Australia were seven for three. That became 43 for four at the end of the day; on the second day, Jones top-scored with 40 from number ten, in a stand of 49 with Jack Saunders, and the lead grew from 26 to 75. Leicestershire responded with 143 in 46.1 overs, while Noble took eight wickets, and on the final day Australia chased 69 in 20 overs.\n22–24 May: Oxford University v Australians.\nAustralians (314/6d) beat Oxford University (77 &amp; 183) by an innings and 54 runs\nOxford University were bowled out by Noble and Armstrong on the second morning at Christ Church, after rain had prevented any play on the first. Batting out the second day, the tourists almost trebled the students' score on that day alone, for the loss of two wickets, with Trumper making 121. They added a further 87 to the total before declaring, and Saunders then bowled the university out, taking seven for 67.\n26–28 May: Marylebone Cricket Club v Australians.\nMarylebone Cricket Club (240 &amp; 280/8d) drew with Australians (271 &amp; 217/3)\nAt Lord's, the Marylebone Cricket Club side captained by W. G. Grace included two players who would turn out for England in the first Test match, C. B. Fry and Ranjitsinhji. In both innings, the two passed 20, with Ranjitsinhji's 67 in the first innings being the highest score for MCC. Grace won the toss and chose to bat, and MCC made 240, but Trumper completed his third century on tour with a two-hour 105, taking the tourists to a lead of 31 though no other player passed 30. Grace took five for 29, including the three lowest-batting players. In the second innings, Frank Mitchell hit 55 not out before MCC declared with a lead of 249, and the tourists fell 32 short, Trumper once more passing 80 before being bowled by Albert Trott.\nFirst Test, 29–31 May: England v Australia.\nEngland had selected 14 players, but left out Jack Mason, Charlie Llewellyn, who had represented South Africa in Test cricket, and Tom Hayward for the game. A.A. Thomson wrote that this \"was reckoned the best integrated side that England ever put into the field: MacLaren, Fry, Tyldesley, Ranjitsinhji, Jackson, Braund, Jessop, Hirst, Lilley, Lockwood and Rhodes.\" Australia off-spinner Hugh Trumble had an injured thumb and could not play; Australia also left out wicketkeeper Carter, and Saunders, who had \"not shown bowling form\" yet, having taken 14 wickets in four matches at a bowling average of 14.21, of which seven came on the final day against Oxford University.\nEngland batted first on what was described as a \"beautiful wicket\", but Fry was out in the third over, caught behind by the wicketkeeper standing back, and captain Archie MacLaren was then run out for nine after a \"misunderstanding\". After 50 minutes at the crease, Ranjitsinhji, who was described as \"upset\" by getting the blame for MacLaren's run out, was bowled by second-change bowler Warwick Armstrong for 13, and England were 35 for three. Jackson then batted until lunch with Tyldesley, and had made 53 when he inside edged Ernie Jones shortly afterwards. Wicketkeeper Lilley followed, having skied a ball from Noble to Jones, while Tyldesley had the luck to survive three dropped catches. Tyldesley went on to make a \"turning point\" partnership with Hirst for 94 in 80 minutes, while Jessop was caught at deep cover having made six and played \"very wild cricket\". Tyldesley was last out on the day, having made 138, an innings described as \"truly magnificent\" despite the chances, including \"masterly defence\" and well timed cuts.\nLockwood and Rhodes added 55 before stumps on the first day, and when play resumed at three o'clock on the second day after rain had fallen during the night, they added a further 25 before MacLaren declared. What followed was described by Wisden as \"one of the chief sensations of [the 1902 season]\". It took 90 minutes to bowl out Australia for 36, with Trumper making half of the total, and though the light was bad the wicket was not \"so difficult as to excuse such an ignominious breakdown\". The Yorkshire bowlers Rhodes and Hirst bowled 22 of the 23 overs, in a manner described by the Wisden Almanack as \"wonderful\". Rhodes got seven wickets for 17, his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket, and up until 2004 joint cheapest seven-for in Test history. Hirst was helped by Braund to get one of his wickets, as the Somerset allrounder pulled off \"a dazzling catch\" to dismiss Clem Hill. For 22 years, the total of 36 stood as the lowest total in a Test match in England.\nHowever, more rain followed. Twelve hours of unbroken rain during Friday night left the wicket unplayable, and though the afternoon was fine no play was possible until quarter past five. The thousands that were admitted got to watch 75 minutes of cricket, in which Australia \"easily\" batted through 28 overs, 13 of them maidens.\n2–3 June: Yorkshire v Australians.\nYorkshire (107 &amp; 50/5) beat Australians (131 &amp; 23) by five wickets\nYorkshire, defending county champions and joint leaders of the 1902 championship, lost the toss at Headingley, were trailing by 24 on first innings, but still became the first team to beat the tourists during the 1902 tour. In fact, they were the only county team to register a win against the Australians.\nThe Australians won the toss and batted, making 131, Trumper top-scoring with 38 while Hirst and Stanley Jackson took four wickets each. Yorkshire lost their three first wickets before the close of the first day, David Denton becoming the second batsman to make more than 25 with his 32, and on the second morning Noble and Howell took the remaining seven wickets to bowl Yorkshire out for 107. Then, the Australians lost six wickets in 13 overs, with Trumper making seven and Gregory an unbeaten ten. Hirst had Trumper, Darling, Noble and Armstrong all bowled, as well as Duff caught by Jackson. With the score 23 for six, Hopkins faced the second ball of Jackson's seventh over – and was given out lbw. Kelly and Jones were bowled, Howell was caught at the wicket, Jackson completed four wickets with five balls, and Yorkshire were left with a target of 48. With Tom Taylor's 11 the highest total of the last two innings, the target was chased down in 19.3 overs, though Noble took three wickets and Howell two. A. A. Thomson recounts that his uncle said that the unbeaten nine made by Irving Washington was the \"finest innings of Irving's life\".\n5–7 June: Lancashire v Australians.\nAustralians (356/7) drew with Lancashire\nThe tourists, fresh from scores of 36 in the Test match and 23 against Yorkshire, now got first use of the wicket at Old Trafford and registered four half-centuries on the first day, through Trumper, Hill, Armstrong and Kelly. The last two days' play were called off, and the match drawn.\n9–10 June: Cambridge University v Australians.\nAustralians (337) beat Cambridge University (100 &amp; 46) by an innings and 183 runs\nThe match was played at Fenner's. Despite being badly hit by illness, Australia won inside two days, for their largest victory on tour. Hugh Trumble played his first match on tour after recovering from an injured thumb, and took the first four wickets of the game, as Cambridge University were bowled out for 108. The Australians, who included their medical advisor, Rowley Pope, who had not played first class cricket since 1891, replied with 337, of which Trumper made 128, and Hopkins then took seven for 10 as the students were all out for 46.\nSecond Test, 12–14 June: England v Australia.\nThe second Test match was restricted to 105 minutes of play, rain and poor pitch conditions accounting for the rest. Australia were suffering from the same ill health that had weakened the team before and during their match in Cambridge; Trumble and Howell had influenza, while Darling, Noble and Saunders all felt ill, though did take part in the game. Saunders thus replaced Howell in the playing eleven. England went in with the same eleven that had played in Birmingham, with Tom Taylor as twelfth man.\nEngland lost two wickets in the first four overs, without any batsman having added to the total; rain then kept interrupting the partnership between Jackson and MacLaren, but the two added 102, giving a few chances that were not taken by Australian fieldsmen. The match was abandoned at quarter past eleven on the third morning, with the ground almost under water. The match still holds the Test match record for the highest match aggregate without an extra.\nThe tourists' health problems and the bad weather which they had been experiencing, combined with their poor recent performances in the First Test and against Yorkshire, meant that this match could be seen as marking the low point of their fortunes. The remainder of the tour would prove far more successful.\n16–18 June: England XI v Australians.\nAustralians (154 &amp; 185) beat England XI (138 &amp; 70) by 131 runs\nThe England XI which took the field at The Saffrons in Eastbourne was captained by Gilbert Jessop and included two more players with Test experience, Bobby Abel and Bill Storer. Neither had featured in the first two Tests of the series, however. Darling won the toss and chose to bat, though play was delayed until after lunch on the first day, and the Australians made 154, with Hill scoring 46 and Trumper 31. England XI then fell to 29 for five, Abel having made 26 of the runs, while Trumble took three wickets. He added a further five to that on the second day, bowling unchanged throughout the England XI's innings, and the eighth-wicket partnership between Jessop and Vivian Crawford was worth almost two-thirds of England XI's total. Trumble eventually had both men caught, and Gregory made 71 as the Australians set a target of 200, while the hosts George Thompson took eight for 88 in the second innings. Trumble then added six to his haul of wickets, as the England XI were bowled out for 70, with both Jessop and Crawford falling in single digits.\n19–21 June: Derbyshire v Australians.\nAustralians (218 &amp; 13/2) beat Derbyshire (152 &amp; 78) by eight wickets\nDerbyshire captain Albert Lawton made 50 from number six at Derby, including a 73-run fifth-wicket stand, and after that the last five pairs added 18 as Derbyshire were bowled out for 152. Hopkins, who opened the batting after going wicketless, made 68 and a stand of 113 with Darling, and the tourists were leading by four with six wickets in hand at close on the first day. No play was possible on the second day, but on the third the Australians added a further 52, before Saunders and Trumble bowled Derbyshire out for 78. After losing the first two wickets for two runs, Carter and Duff made it to the target of 13 for no further loss.\n23–24 June: Yorkshire v Australians.\nAustralians (106 &amp; 87) beat Yorkshire (77 &amp; 72) by 44 runs\nThe Australians travelled to Park Avenue Cricket Ground in Bradford seeking to gain revenge for the defeat three weeks earlier, which they did, in a match where the average partnership was worth 8.55 runs – the lowest thus far on tour, beating 8.88 in the previous Yorkshire v Australians clash. The Australians batted first, and Hill and Darling put on 74 for the third wicket, \nbefore Rhodes and Schofield Haigh bowled them out for 106. In reply, Saunders and Trumble took all ten wickets after bowling unchanged through 29.2 overs, Trumble getting six for 17 while Saunders took four for 58, with wicket-keeper David Hunter top-scoring with 14 from number eleven.\nThe Australians led by 29, and despite a Haigh five-for, Gregory made an unbeaten 42 which lasted into the second day, setting a target of 117. John Brown and John Tunnicliffe put on 14 for the first wicket, but Trumble and Saunders then took four wickets for one run, and though Irving Washington made the highest score in the match for Yorkshire with 22, Trumble ended with six for 27 as the Australians triumphed by 44 runs.\n26–28 June: England XI v Australians.\nAustralians (402 &amp; 42/3) beat England XI (240 &amp; 203, f/o) by seven wickets\nThis match was hastily arranged; the coronation of Edward VII was planned for 26 June, but the King developed appendicitis and the Australians decided to remain at Bradford to play an England XI. It included one former Test player, Willie Quaife. The Australians won the toss, batted first, and made a total higher than the entire previous match had produced. Trumper made 113 before he was bowled by Jack Knutton of Coventry, who had played one first class match eight years before, and now returned to take nine for 100. Knutton, who usually played in the Bradford Leagues, bowled at quick pace but his action was sometimes regarded as suspect. In his second over, he bowled Noble, Hill and Darling, but Trumper and Duff put on 193 for the fifth wicket, before Trumper fell five short of the ground's fifth-wicket record. Duff went on to make 182 before he, too, was bowled by Knutton. The England XI were bowled out for 240 and 203, with Quaife making 68 in the first and captain Reginald Crawford making 90 in the second, and Knutton had Darling out a second time before the Australians chased down the total with seven wickets to spare.\n30 June – 1 July: Scotland v Australians.\nAustralians (305) beat Scotland (109 &amp; 91) by an innings and 105 runs\nThis match at The Grange was not considered first class. Scotland made 109 in the first innings, and the Australians responded with 283 for six at the close of the first day's play, with Duff having made 98. Hopkins was on 42 not out overnight; he did not add to that, but the Australians still added 22, all coming from Jones at No. 10 and Saunders at No. 11. Needing 195 to make the Australians bat again, Scotland were bowled out for 91, with the Australians using six bowlers.\nThird Test, 3–5 July: England v Australia.\nThis was to be the only Test match played at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, which became England's seventh Test ground. From Australia's squad for the second Test, one change was made, as a recovered Trumble replaced Ernie Jones in the eleven. Jack Saunders retained his place, having not featured in the first match. England made several changes; Bobby Abel was originally selected to replace Fry in the top order, but Ranjitsinhji was ruled out due to a strained leg and Fry took his place back. Schofield Haigh had also been added to the twelve originally, but both he and Lockwood were left out in favour of Sydney Barnes, a last-minute replacement. \"Wisden\" claimed that \"there [could] be no question that a grave mistake was committed in not playing Lockwood.\"\nThe English \"Wisden\" account acknowledged that Australia \"played the finer all-round cricket\" and \"fully deserved their victory\", but still claimed that \"all the luck of the game went their way\" as they won by 143 runs. The first lucky streak was to win the toss and bat; Braund opened the bowling with Hirst, and had Trumper out bowled for one early on. Barnes took the next four wickets, all caught, including Darling for a golden duck, before Noble and Hopkins added 54 for the sixth wicket, the largest partnership thus far in the game. Noble was out caught off Rhodes, and Barnes removed Hopkins and Kelly, but Armstrong and Trumble put on 57 for the ninth wicket and Australia totalled 194.\nAgain according to the Wisden account, England had \"much of the best of the match\" when MacLaren and Abel had taken the score to 60 for nought. But Noble bowled both, and as the light faded Noble and Saunders struck three more times before England successfully appealed against bad light a quarter before the scheduled close. By then England had lost three wickets for a single run, to close on 102 for five with Lilley and Braund set to resume.\nRain then fell overnight and the start of the second day's play was delayed, after which England lost their last five wickets for 43 runs, with Jessop the only England batsman to make it into double figures. Then, Trumper entered, to play what Wisden described as his most \"marvellous\" innings of the summer. In 50 minutes, he scored 62, the first half-century in the match, \"doing whatsoever he liked with the English bowling\", before he was caught behind off Jackson's bowling. Barnes had Darling caught with no further score added, but then Hill and Gregory got together. Hill then became the only man to score a Test century at Bramall Lane, leaving with the total on 225 after \"a great innings\", and though it was \"not entirely free from fault\" with a couple of dropped catches, it took a \"wonderful catch\" by MacLaren off Jackson to dismiss him.\nHopkins and Armstrong added 52 for the seventh wicket, taking the lead past 300, before Rhodes took the final four wickets in 19 balls. England now needed 339 to win the game, which would be a new Test record, the previous one of 315 being set by Australia in January. They sent Jessop out to open the innings, and he made an unbeaten 53 overnight, as England closed on 73 for one. However, on the third morning they lost three wickets in the first half-hour, and despite MacLaren's \"great effort\" of 63, including an hour-long stand with Jackson, it was Noble (six for 52) and Trumble (four for 49) who came out on top. On Saturday morning, after coming on for Saunders, he took five for 22 in twelve overs, though the pitch \"show[ed] unmistakable signs of wear\". Noble ended with eleven for 103, his second and last ten-wicket haul in Test match cricket.\n7–9 July: Warwickshire v Australians.\nWarwickshire (124 &amp; 225/7d) drew with Australians (316)\nWarwickshire won the toss at Edgbaston, chose to bat, and were bowled out by Warwick Armstrong, who took six for 13 as Warwickshire fell from 98 for three to 124 all out. Nine Australians made it into double figures, though only Gregory got past 50, making 83. Warwickshire closed the second day ten runs ahead and with five wickets down. Only forty minutes of play was possible on the third day, with Ernie Jones taking both wickets before the game was eventually called off as a draw.\n10–12 July: Worcestershire v Australians.\nAustralians (274 &amp; 199) beat Worcestershire (202 &amp; 97) by 174 runs\nAlbert Bird got six wickets for Worcestershire after they were put in the field at New Road. The Australians made 274, then bowled out Worcestershire for 202 despite a last-wicket stand of 62 between George Gaukrodger and Robert Burrows. At the end of the second day, the Australians had added a further 169 for the loss of five wickets, and though they lost their final wickets for 30 runs, Worcestershire were bowled out for 97 by Ernie Jones (six for 53) and Warwick Armstrong (four for 34)\n14–16 July: Gloucestershire v Australians.\nAustralians (545/5d) beat Gloucestershire (155 &amp; 168) by an innings and 222 runs\nGloucestershire became the first side to concede 500 against the Australians, and suffered the largest defeat margin thus far on tour, losing by an innings and 222 runs at Ashley Down. After winning the toss and batting, they were bowled out for 155, then conceded 111 against Trumper and Duff before the day was over – Trumper making 83 of those runs. On the second day, Trumper was caught by Jessop for 92, but Hill, Noble and Hopkins all made hundreds, as the Australians totalled 434 in a day. They declared overnight, before bowling Gloucestershire out for 168.\n17–19 July: Somerset v Australians.\nSomerset (274 &amp; 315) drew with Australians (348 &amp; 16/0)\nIn this match at Taunton, Somerset batted first. Saunders took five wickets for 109 for the tourists on the first day, four caught and one lbw as the hosts made 274. In reply, Somerset got two wickets, but Duff had made 75 by stumps on the first day; when he gave a return catch to George Gill, he had made 183 in a three-hour innings, which turned out to be more than half of the Australians' total. Somerset were 159 for five overnight, with Lionel Palairet having made 90, but Somerset's Randall Johnson made 62 as they almost doubled that score on the third day. The Australians did not have enough time to chase 242 for victory.\n21–23 July: Surrey v Australians.\nSurrey (296 &amp; 111) drew with Australians (313 &amp; 11/0)\nAt The Oval, England Test batsman Bobby Abel made a hundred for Surrey, who batted through the entire first day to make 296. The Australians then scored 313 at almost double the rate, with play ending early on the second day due to rain, before Saunders took six for nine to bowl Surrey out for 111. However, as the Australians had to travel to Manchester for the Fourth Test, they did not attempt to chase 95 for victory.\nFourth Test: 24–26 July: England v Australia.\nAustralia secured the series with one match to play, though only with a three-run margin, as England, who required 32 to win with seven wickets in hand, fell to Trumble and Saunders' bowling. A. A. Thomson claimed that this match, along with the fifth Test of this series, was \"the most dramatic in Test history\" when he wrote in 1967, excepting the Tied Test in 1960–61. Neville Cardus, who later wrote an article on the game he had watched as a 13-year-old, said: \"The match at the end seemed to get right out of the control of the men that were making it; it seemed to take on a being of its own, a volition of its own, and the mightiest cricketers in the land looked as though they were in the grip of a power of which they could feel the presence but whose ends they could not understand.\"\nAustralia, who went in unchanged from the Third Test, won the toss and batted first against an England side where Lionel Palairet, Ranjitsinhji, Lockwood and Fred Tate had replaced Fry, Hirst, Jessop and Barnes. The Sussex bowler Tate was given his Test debut, but it was to be his only one; nevertheless, the match is known as \"Tate's match\". He dropped a crucial catch, and was last man out when England heeded only four more runs to win. In the 1903 Wisden, it is claimed that leaving out Hirst for Tate was a \"blunder\", though the decision was inspired by a rain-affected wicket. Likewise, not selecting Jessop was called \"a mistake\".\nAccording to Barker and Rosenwater England did well to get so close to winning as they did, Australia gaining a large advantage from batting first. The ground was very wet when play began, and the pitch was initially slow and easy. Furthermore, the bowlers' run-ups were so slippery that Lockwood was unable to bowl for over an hour.\nAccording to \"Wisden\", \"the ball did nothing on the soft turf\", but the England bowlers pitched it too short, allowing Trumper and Duff to add 135 in the first 80 minutes before Duff was caught at the wicket by third-change bowler Lockwood, who had been introduced with the score on 129. Australia were 173 for one at lunch, with Trumper becoming the first player in a Test to reach his hundred before lunch, before Rhodes struck three times to remove Trumper, Noble and Gregory, all caught with ten further runs added since lunch. Trumper's 104 was described as \"one without mistake of any kind.\" Another stand developed, however, between Darling and Hill; Darling made 51 before he was caught by England captain MacLaren, and the two added 73 for the fifth wicket, a partnership described as \"invaluable\" by Wisden. Darling hit two sixes, the first in a Test in England (prior to 1910 the ball had to be hit out of the ground for six runs to be awarded, so that sixes were rare).\nThe wicket had dried out since lunch, and Saunders and Trumble took five wickets for 44, with only Tyldesley passing 20 for England on the first day. They closed on 70 for five, but the following day was \"England's day\". First, Jackson and Braund added 115 to the overnight score, a stand broken just before lunch when Braund was bowled by Noble, steering a ball outside off onto the stumps. Jackson then kept the scoring rate going, making 128, the highest score of the game, and England's total increased by 77 before he was finally out, 24 of them contributed by the lower-order batsmen, who were out to Noble and Trumble. England thus trailed by 37 on first innings, having been given some runs when Gregory missed \"the simplest of chances\" at cover point, but Australia were undone by Lockwood's bowling. He took the new ball, removed Trumper, Hill and Duff, and Australia were ten for three. Six more runs were added before the left-handed Darling hit a catch to deep square leg on the railway side, where Palairet would normally have fielded. But MacLaren had sent Tate, normally a close-in fielder, to that position. Tate dropped the catch, and Darling went on to make 37, the highest score of the innings, and share a stand of 48 with Gregory before Tate broke the stand, having Gregory lbw. Wisden speculated it was likely that the Australians would have been all out for 50–60 if the catch had been held. Despite Lockwood's five-wicket-haul, and match figures of eleven for 76, Australia lasted into the third morning, making 86, and setting a target of 124. This total is still the lowest all-out innings in Test match history to include a fifty partnership (Joe Darling and Syd Gregory added 54 runs for the 4th wicket).\nRain had fallen for considerable time overnight, making the pitch difficult, though MacLaren and Palairet cut 36 off the target before lunch was taken. Palairet was then bowled by Saunders, and Tyldesley and MacLaren followed, the latter caught far out in the field by Duff for 35. Australia's Saunders then dropped Abel before rain stopped play again. After the break, England's batsmen were instructed to hit out. Abel added 20 with Ranjitsinhji, who looked uncertain against Trumble and was eventually given lbw, and Trumble and Saunders kept at the English batsmen. Abel was bowled trying to drive, Jackson caught at mid off, Braund stumped, and Lockwood bowled, England now requiring 11 to win with two wickets in hand. Rhodes came in and struck a boundary, and Lilley hit two scoring shots to take the tally to 116, before Hill, starting from long on, took a brilliant running catch square in the deep, in front of the pavilion, to dismiss him when the ball, albeit held up in the wind, had seemed sure to go for four.\nThen rain struck once more, and the players left the field for 45 minutes. When they returned, seven runs were required, and the debutant Tate came to the crease to face Saunders. He edged down the leg side for four with the first ball, before the next two were no-scoring shots. The fourth ball of the over, a quicker one which kept low, struck the stumps, leaving Tate bowled and Australia winners by three runs.\nThe inclusion of Tate in the England side appears to have been a result of friction between MacLaren and the selectors (and in particular their chairman, Lord Hawke) that had developed during the course of the series. According to Fry, the selectors included Tate in the twelve (he was a late addition to the eleven originally selected) because they thought that MacLaren could not possibly pick him and would therefore have to play their preferred eleven. However, MacLaren was supposedly annoyed that Haigh was not included, and therefore on the morning of the match chose Tate for the final eleven in preference to Hirst. However, Tate had been having a great season, eventually finishing second in the first-class wicket tallies behind Rhodes, and an argument could be made for his inclusion.\n28–30 July: Essex v Australians.\nEssex (345 &amp; 184/3d) drew with Australians (232 &amp; 253/6)\nThe Australians got their third successive draw against a county side at Leyton, with Victor Trumper making a pair of hundreds. Essex lost five wickets on the first day, with Frederick Fane, Charlie McGahey and Charles Kortright all passing 50. Jones took four wickets as Essex could only add a further 34 on the second day, before Australia were bowled out 113 short; Trumper made nearly half the total, while no Essex bowler took more than two wickets. Three more half-centuries, from Alfred Lucas, Percy Perrin and McGahey followed before Essex declared, and Australia batted out the day for a draw, Trumper making 119.\n31 July – 2 August: Sussex v Australians.\nAustralians (580/6d) drew with Sussex (185 &amp; 130/1, f/o)\nThe Australians drew their fourth successive match, which nevertheless provided a few records. Monty Noble recorded his highest career score, making 284 and sharing a partnership of 428 with Warwick Armstrong, a new sixth-wicket record for The County Ground at Hove, which has remained standing for over 100 years. Tate, the unlucky man from the Fourth Test, bowled 41 overs without reward, while Albert Relf took four wickets before meeting Noble and Armstrong. Noble was eventually stumped off Ernest Killick, leaving a declaration. In reply Sussex were 84 for three overnight, eventually bowled out for 185 as Saunders took four for 22, but Vine and Killick held on for the draw by batting out 39 overs after being asked to follow on.\n4–5 August: Glamorgan and Wiltshire v Australians.\nAustralians (148 &amp; 155/4) beat Glamorgan and Wiltshire (121 &amp; 178)\nThe then minor counties Glamorgan and Wiltshire fielded a combined team for a non-first class match at Cardiff Arms Park. The hosts made 121, before William Overton and Harry Creber shared the first seven wickets, all falling in single digits except Hill. Jones and Hopkins passed 30, however, and the Australians took a lead of 27; however, despite seven for 36 from Armstrong, Herbie Morgan and Walter Medlicott scored half-centuries as Glamorgan made the highest total of the match, 178, on the second morning. Kelly's unbeaten 42 and Gregory's 44 helped the visitors chase the target of 152 with six wickets to spare.\n7–8 August: Hampshire v Australians.\nAustralians (325) beat Hampshire (130 &amp; 116) by an innings and 79 runs\nThe match at Southampton's County Ground was originally scheduled to be a three-day affair, but due to the postponed coronation of King Edward VII, it was agreed to hold a two-day match. The Australians still won; after Hampshire decided to bat, Trumble bowled unchanged and took three for 53, while from the other end Noble took six wickets after being introduced in the 22nd over. The visitors were 69 for four when Noble came to the wicket, and together with Darling he quickly put the runs on the board. At stumps on day one they had added 107 without loss; Darling made 116 in 80 minutes, joining Noble in a stand of 155, and despite the lower order all being bowled by Arthur Hill the Australians made 325 in 61.1 overs, with Noble ending on 113. After Saunders had got the openers out caught and Sprot had been run out, Trumble took the remaining wickets bar one, and Sussex were bowled out for 116.\nFifth Test: 11–13 August: England v Australia.\nRemarkably, this match turned out to be as exciting as the previous one had been. It has become known as \"Jessop's match\", for his 104 in only 77 minutes in England's second innings turned the game. When he came to the wicket, England were 48/5, and scoring the 263 that they needed to win seemed far beyond them. Saunders had taken four of the wickets. Jessop's previous highest Test score was only 55, but now he reached his hundred off just 76 balls, after an uncertain start when he gave two chances with his score in the twenties. He and Jackson added 109, before Jackson was out for 49 to make the score 157/6. Hirst helped him take the score to 187 before Jessop himself was out. \"Wisden\" said of his innings: \"All things considered a more astonishing display has never been seen. What he did would have been scarcely possible under the same circumstances to any other living batsmen.\"\nWith 76 still needed and only three wickets remaining, the odds seemed once more to have shifted against England. Lockwood scored only two, but he helped Hirst add another 27 before being dismissed: 214/8. Lilley helped Hirst to add a further 34 before he was Trumble's fourth victim of the innings and twelfth of the match: 248/9. (Darling had entrusted almost all the bowling to Saunders and Trumble; they sent down all but nine overs of the 66.5 that the innings lasted.) So Rhodes joined Hirst with 15 still needed. Legend has it that Hirst said to Rhodes, \"We'll get them in singles, Wilfred.\" However Rhodes denied the story, Hirst said he could not recall what his words had been, and not every run was a single. But get the runs they did, Hirst finishing with 58 not out. He had top-scored with 43 in just 45 minutes in the first innings, as well as taking 5 wickets in Australia's first innings, so this was his match almost as much as it was Jessop's.\nReturning to the beginning of the match, England crucially, as it proved, recalled Jessop and Hirst, omitting Ranji and Tate. Tom Hayward came in for his first match of the series, replacing Abel. Australia were once more unchanged. When Australia batted first, the pitch – though wet – played easily. England did well to reduce them to 175/7, but Hopkins, Trumble and Kelly ensured that the eighth and ninth wickets contributed another 149.\nRain in the night made the pitch difficult, and England were 94/6 at lunch, Trumble having taken five of the wickets. The wicket improved after lunch, and Braund and Hirst added 54 for the seventh wicket. England still needed 38 to avoid the likelihood of being asked to follow on, with the sun coming out and the wicket likely soon to deteriorate once more, but Lockwood helped Hirst add a further 42. Crucially, Hill missed Lockwood in the deep not long after he had come in. Though the ninth and tenth wickets fell quickly, England had reduced their first innings deficit to 141. Trumble, having top scored for Australia, had followed up by taking 8/65.\nAt the end of the second day, Australia had reached 114/8, never recovering from the early loss of Trumper to a run out, and the last two wickets fell quickly the next morning. Lockwood finished with 5/45. So England were left 263 to win, and the stage was set for Jessop's heroics.\n14–16 August: Marylebone Cricket Club v Australians.\nAustralians (427) beat Marylebone Cricket Club (212 &amp; 181) by an innings and 34 runs\nMCC won the toss at Lord's and batted first. They struggled, with Ranjitsinhji top scoring with 60 and Howell taking 6/105. The Australians were 80/2 at the end of the day's play. Next day, Hill took his score to 136, made in 240 minutes, with support from Noble (70) and Gregory (86). At the end of day two, MCC were 23–1. Next day, only H.A. Carpenter (66) and E. Smith (48) resisted for long. Armstrong took 6/44.\n18–20 August: Gloucestershire v Australians.\nAustralians (312) beat Gloucestershire (152 &amp; 150) by an innings and 10 runs\nIn spite of the loss of almost all of the first day to rain at the College Ground, Cheltenham, where the Australians batted first and reached 21/1, they had another comfortable victory. On the second day, Trumper made up for lost time by scoring 125 in only 120 minutes. Jessop took 7/91. By close of play, the county were 147/9, having collapsed from 103/3 at one stage. The last wicket soon fell the next morning, Armstrong finishing with 4/35 and Hopkins 4/11. Following on, the running out of Jessop for 43 probably sealed their fate, though W. Troup managed 45* and enabled a partial recovery from 69/6. Armstrong and Hopkins bowled unchanged, taking 4/74 and 5/65 respectively.\n21–23 August: Kent v Australians.\nAustralians (154 &amp; 209) beat Kent (77 &amp; 197) by 89 runs\nThe tourists won the toss and batted first at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury. By the end of the day's play, 21 wickets had fallen, with the Australians 8/1 in their second innings. Noble top scored with 43 in their first innings, before being run out. Colin Blythe took 4/50 and Alec Hearne 3/39. If the Australians had found batting difficult, Kent found it even more so as Trumble, bowling unchanged, returned an analysis of 8/30, at the time the best of his career. James Seymour, batting at number 4, did well to survive, finishing on 26*. Conditions appeared a little easier for batting next day. Trumper made 69 before he was run out. Kent were set 287 to win. At one point they were 138/4, but then they fell away. Saunders took the last five wickets, to finish with figures of 5/43. Trumble had 3/92.\n25–27 August: Middlesex v Australians.\nAustralians (232 &amp; 176/4) beat Middlesex (205 &amp; 203) by 6 wickets\nWhen Middlesex won the toss and batted at Lord's, for the second match in succession Trumble took eight wickets in an innings, this time 8/101 bowling unchanged. PF Warner made 58. The tourists were 3/1 at the end of the first day. Next day, they could only establish a first innings lead of 28, their top scorer being Trumper with 69. At close of play, Middlesex had reached 122/5 in their second innings. When their innings was completed the following day, GW Beldam had made 75 and Trumble taken 4/48, giving him a total of 23 wickets in two consecutive matches. It had been a low-scoring matches, but the Australians had no difficulty in reaching their target, Noble (59*) and Armstrong (47) adding 95 for the fourth wicket. Trumper passed 2000 runs in first-class matches for the season when he reached 24 in the first innings. Trumble reached 100 wickets in first-class matches for the season when taking his 8th wicket in the first innings.\n28–30 August: Lancashire v Australians.\nAustralians (138 &amp; 105) beat Lancashire (120 &amp; 105) by 18 runs\nIn a low-scoring match at the Liverpool Cricket Club Ground at Aigburth, the tourists almost suffered their third defeat. George Littlewood and Alexander Kermode shared 36 of the 38 overs in the Australian first innings, taking 5/49 and 5/68 respectively. At the end of the first day, Lancashire were 61/2, only 77 behind, but next morning they lost two wickets without adding to their score and only added another 44, Saunders finishing with 6/52. In their second innings, the Australians were 91/4, but then lost their last 6 wickets while only 14 runs were added. Littlewood took 7/49 for match figures of 12/98. At the close of the second day, the county were 77/5, needing only a further 47 to win. They added another 16 before the sixth wicket fell, but only managed 12 more before being all out. Trumble took 5/44 and Saunders 4/37. Littlewood's figures in each innings were his best in first-class cricket at the time, as were Kermode's in the first innings.\n1–3 September: Players v Australians.\nThe Players (184 &amp; 128) lost to Australians (359) by an innings and 47 runs\nWinning the toss and batting at Harrogate, the Players were indebted to their captain Willie Quaife, who top-scored with 58. At one point 165/5, they then collapsed. Saunders finished with 4/44 and Hopkins had 3/21. By close of play, the Australians had reached 59/0 in reply. Next day, Trumper went on to 127 made in only 105 minutes and, with Darling and Hopkins each passing fifty, the tourists established a big lead. By the end of day two the Players had reached 30/2, and they were all out for another 98 on the final day, Saunders finishing with figures of 5/44.\n4–6 September: CI Thornton's XI v Australians.\nCI Thornton's XI (198 &amp; 202/9d) drew with Australians (247 &amp; 120/4)\nCI Thornton had put together a strong side which included six Yorkshiremen. They won the toss at the North Marine Road ground at Scarborough and batted. They slumped to 79/6 but their captain, Stanley Jackson, scored 72 and led a partial recovery. Trumble took 5/62 and Saunders 5/74. The Australians were 31/2 at the day's end. Next day, Trumper made 62 and Hopkins 49*, but the tourists led by only 49 on first innings. Wilfred Rhodes took 4/95 and George Thompson 3/32. By close of play the home side were 87/6 in their second innings, but next day Johnny Tyldesley, who had been 55* overnight, went on to make 88. An unbroken last wicket stand of 52 by Haigh and Rhodes enabled Thornton's XI to declare. Saunders finished with 5/95. When Trumper (55) was the fourth wicket to fall, the visitors gave up the chase for the 154 that they needed to win and accepted the draw, having batted for 24.5 overs.\n8–10 September: South v Australians.\nAustralians (249 &amp; 248) drew with the South (403/7d &amp; 87/5)\nAt Hastings the Australians very nearly suffered what would have been their third defeat, with the South, captained by WG Grace, being only eight runs short of victory when time ran out. The tourists made a partial recovery from 94/5 thanks to Noble (63) and Hopkins (74), supported by Trumble, but after Hopkins was the seventh man out the end came quickly, Cuthbert Burnup taking three of the last four wickets to return figures of 3/22. Braund took 4/88. The South were 53/0 in reply by the end of the first day. Next day, Burnup and Abel took their first wicket stand to 122, Hayward made 106 in 180 minutes, and most of the other batsmen made useful contributions. Grace declared overnight, with Noble having taken 4/89. Next day the tourists made a good start. But after Duff was the first man out with the score at 102, Trumper stood almost alone, eventually being out for 120. Joe Vine took 7/31. With the pitch seemingly helping the spinners, Trumble and Armstrong shared the 22 overs that were possible in the South's second innings before time ran out. In the context of a run-chase, Armstrong did well to concede only 36 runs from his 11 overs, and took two wickets. Trumble had figures of 3/47.\n11–13 September: South v Australians.\nAustralians (123 &amp; 91) beat the South (87 &amp; 66) by 61 runs\nThere was no play on the scheduled first day of this match at Dean Park Cricket Ground, Bournemouth, but with the highest of the four innings only totalling 123 there was still time for a positive result, the Australians getting revenge for their scare at Hastings against a South side that contained only three of the same players. Noble's 30 in the tourists' first innings was the highest score of the match. Fred Tate and Ted Arnold bowled unchanged in both Australian innings, Arnold taking 8/57 and 4/30 and Tate 2/61 and 6/48. At the close of the scheduled second day the South's first innings stood at 53/6, and when it ended the next morning Trumble had returned new career-best figures of 9/39, beating the 8/30 he had managed only a few weeks earlier. He took a further 6/29 in the second innings, only Fry (26) offering much resistance.\n15–17 September: Players v Australians.\nThe Players (356 &amp; 117/3) drew with Australians (414)\nThe tour's final match was at The Oval. A strong Players side won the toss, but had reached only 283/6 by the end of the first day, Hayward making 74, Tyldesley 56 and James Iremonger 66. When the innings was completed next day, Saunders had figures of 4/50. The Australians reached 208/2 in reply, 75 minutes being lost to rain, with Trumper scoring 96 and Hill on 79 not out. Hill was soon out next morning for 81 and there was a minor collapse to 233/5. But nearly 200 runs were added for the last five wickets, with Trumble making 68. Rhodes took 5/115. The tour ended on a note of anticlimax, with the home side playing out time in their second innings."

        "title": "Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team represents the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I. The program's first year of competition was 1897, and NU has since compiled an all-time record of 1,535–1,417, with eight NCAA tournament and sixteen NIT appearances. The team has been coached by Fred Hoiberg since 2019.\nNebraska did not make the NCAA Tournament until 1986 and remains the only major-conference program to have never won a tournament game. Prior to the creation of the NCAA Tournament, Nebraska was a Midwest power under head coaches R. G. Clapp and Ewald O. Stiehm; the retroactive Premo-Porretta Power Poll ranked the Cornhuskers in the top ten three times between 1897 and 1903. Much of the team's modest modern-day success came during the fourteen-year tenure of Danny Nee, Nebraska's all-time winningest head coach. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their seven NCAA Tournament appearances and six NIT bids, including the 1996 NIT championship, NU's only national postseason title. After Nee was fired in 2000, head coaches Barry Collier, Doc Sadler, and Tim Miles combined to take the Cornhuskers to the NCAA Tournament just once in nineteen seasons. Miles was fired in 2019 and Nebraska hired former Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nAs near as can be determined, the University of Nebraska was first represented by a men's basketball team on February 2, 1897, six years after the invention of the sport by James Naismith. The Nebraska \"Bugeaters\" defeated a team from the Lincoln YMCA 11–8 at Grant Memorial Hall, which was located on the site of the current Sheldon Museum of Art and served as NU's primary home venue for all but two seasons until the Nebraska Coliseum opened in 1926. NU faced another university for the first time in 1899, winning games against Nebraska Wesleyan and Doane to claim the unofficial state championship. Nebraska, by then known as the \"Cornhuskers\", played an out-of-state opponent for the first time the following season, defeating James Naismith and Kansas 48–8 in what is still the worst loss in KU history. NU's 1900 team was retroactively ranked second nationally by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nIn 1911, Ewald O. Stiehm, NU's fiery football coach, became the school's first full-time basketball coach. His first team won fourteen of fifteen games; the student newspaper blamed the only loss on Nebraska's inability to adjust to Minnesota's 100-foot floor. Under Stiehm, Nebraska won or shared the MVIAA championship in 1912, 1913, and 1914, and guard Sam Carrier became Nebraska's first All-American. After the 1916 football season, Stiehm was offered $4,500 annually to take over as football coach and athletic director at Indiana; despite suggesting he'd remain at Nebraska for less money, the school refused to offer him a raise and Stiehm left. Nebraska won another conference title in 1916, after Sam Waugh replaced Stiehm as the Cornhuskers' coach for a single season. Waugh was succeeded by E.J. Stewart, whose three Cornhusker teams had a combined record of 29–23. Nebraska went 22–2 in 1919–20 and 11–3 in 1920–21 under P.J. Schissler. After the 1920 season, Schissler challenged the University of Chicago to a postseason game, but the offer was declined. The Cornhuskers were invited to a postseason AAU tournament in Atlanta, but didn't participate.\nAthletic director Fred Leuhring arranged for Nebraska to play its home basketball games in 1921 at the State Fairgrounds Coliseum, which had a wider court and more seating capacity than Grant Hall. Nebraska's first game at the Fairgrounds was a 31–10 win over Grinnell on January 14, 1921, with a crowd of 1,500 in attendance. After two seasons, the Cornhuskers returned to a remodeled Grant Hall and played there until 1926, when the school finished construction on the $445,000 Nebraska Coliseum. The Coliseum's seating capacity of 8,000 nearly quadrupled that of Grant Hall. The Cornhuskers lost 25–14 to Kansas in the first game at their new home on February 6, 1926.\nAfter ending the decade with an 11–5 season under former Kansas All-American Charles T. Black, Nebraska had just two winning seasons over the following nineteen years, one of which was a Big Six championship in 1937. The 1930s produced four more Cornhusker All-Americans: Don Maclay in 1931, Steve Hokuf in 1933, George Wahlquist in 1936, and Robert Parsons in 1937. Maclay was the Big Six's scoring leader in 1930, scoring 112 points in ten league games.\nHarry Good (1946–54).\nHarry Good was hired as head coach in 1946, and after two losing seasons he turned Nebraska's fortunes around. In 1948–49, Good's Huskers went 16–10, tied Oklahoma for the Big Seven championship and defeated the Sooners in a conference playoff to qualify for an NCAA berth. The Cornhuskers lost 52–35 to MVC champion Oklahoma A&amp;M 52–35, which finished runner-up to Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats. In 1949–50, Nebraska again won sixteen games and shared the Big Seven title with Kansas and Kansas State, NU's most recent regular season conference championship. Claude Retherford and Bus Whitehead were named all-conference performers in 1949, and Whitehead earned the honor again the next year. The 6-ft 11-in. Whitehead averaged a then-school-record 15.7 points per game in 1950 and was the first Cornhusker selected to play in the East-West All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden. When he graduated, Whitehead held nine school scoring records. This period of relative prosperity was followed with fifteen consecutive losing seasons. Despite playing for a team that finished last in the Big Seven, Husker guard Jim Buchanan earned All-America and all-conference honors in 1952.\nJerry Bush (1954–63).\nJerry Bush, dubbed the \"Big Bear of the Coliseum,\" never produced a winning team in his nine seasons at Nebraska, and never finished higher than fourth in conference play. Nevertheless, his colorful personality and uncanny ability to fashion upsets kept Cornhuskers fans entertained. The most dramatic of these upsets came against No. 4 Kansas in 1958. The Jayhawks defeated the Cornhuskers 102–46 earlier in the year, with star center Wilt Chamberlain single-handedly matching Nebraska's forty-six points. In the rematch, guard Jim Kubacki hit a jump shot with two seconds remaining to give Nebraska a 43–41 win. Kubacki started the game out with a knee injury, but when team captain Gary Reimers hurt his leg with seven minutes remaining, Kubacki convinced Bush to let him suit up.\nBush coached the school's first 1,000-point scorer, Indianapolis native Herschell Turner, who was rated the second-best high school player in the state as a senior, behind only Oscar Robertson. Turner earned All-America honors in 1959 and followed with All-Big Eight honors in 1960 and ended his collegiate career with 1,056 points.\nJoe Cipriano (1963–80).\nIn March 1963, Bush was replaced as head coach by thirty-one-year-old Joe Cipriano. Nebraska athletic director Tippy Dye had coached Cipriano at Washington, where they led the Huskies to the 1953 Final Four and a 79–15 record during the energetic Cipriano's varsity career. Following graduation, he served as an assistant coach at his alma mater until he was hired by Idaho in 1960. His Vandals improved in each of his three seasons and posted a 20–6 record in 1962–63, led by future Basketball Hall of Famer Gus Johnson. \"Slippery Joe\" brought an up-tempo style of basketball to the Coliseum; his Nebraska teams ran a full-court press and fast-break offense, which led the Big Eight in scoring average in 1966, 1967, and 1968.\nCipriano's first two teams struggled to a combined record of 17–33. But his third team, in 1965–66, was one of the most successful in school history, finishing 20–5 and second to Kansas in the Big Eight. However, that was not enough to garner a postseason bid, as only the conference champion was guaranteed a berth in the twenty-two-team NCAA tournament.\nThe 1966–67 team finished 16–9 and made the school's first postseason appearance, in the fourteen-team NIT at Madison Square Garden. Guard Stu Lantz, a two-time All-Big Eight selection, led the Cornhuskers in scoring and rebounding in both 1966–67 and 1967–68. Guard Marvin Stewart and center Chuck Jura earned All-Big Eight honors in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Guard Jerry Fort, who finished his career with a then-school record 1,882 points, was the first Nebraska player chosen first-team all-conference three times. Led by Cipriano and Fort, Nebraska began a string of fourteen consecutive winning seasons.\nIn the fall of 1976, NU basketball moved out of the Coliseum and into the state-of the-art NU Sports Complex (now the Bob Devaney Sports Center), located on the State Fairgrounds. The $13 million athletic complex was financed by a special cigarette tax.\nCipriano coached Nebraska to another twenty-victory season in 1977–78. The Cornhuskers, led by All-Big Eight guard Brian Banks, finished 22–8 and advanced to the second round of the NIT. By the 1979–80 season, Cipriano's failing health – he would die of cancer in November 1980 – meant he had to share coaching duties with assistant Moe Iba, and they took Nebraska to the NIT again. The duo were named co-recipients of Big Eight Coach of the Year.\nCipriano brought Nebraska into the modern era, coaching seventeen seasons and 450 games. His record of 253–197 gave him nearly one-fifth of Nebraska's all-time wins, and 168 more than any previous NU head coach.\nMoe Iba (1980–86).\nIba was named head coach following Cipriano's death in November 1980. In Iba's six seasons, Nebraska was 106–71 and advanced to postseason play four times.\nCenter Andre Smith was the 1981 Big Eight Player of the Year and twice earned all-conference honors. However, it was Jack Moore, a 5-ft 10-in. playmaker from Muncie, Indiana, who captured the hearts of Nebraska fans in the early 1980s. Moore earned All-Big Eight honors in 1982, when he won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the nation's top player six feet tall or shorter. Moore scored 1,204 points, shot .901 from the free throw line during his career, and was NU's first three-time academic All-Big Eight selection.\nThe cornerstone of Iba's teams from 1983 through 1986 was Omaha native Dave Hoppen, a three-time All-Big Eight center and the first Nebraska basketball player to have his jersey number (No. 42) retired by the school. In 1982–83, Hoppen's freshman season, the Cornhuskers went 22–10 and won three games in the NIT before losing to DePaul in the semifinals. The Cornhuskers returned to the NIT each of the next two seasons, advancing to the second round both times.\nHoppen's college career was ended by a knee injury he sustained against Colorado on February 1, 1986. He finished as the school's all-time scoring leader with 2,167 points and broke or tied nineteen school records. Despite Hoppen's injury, Iba's team earned the school's first NCAA Tournament berth, where they lost to Western Kentucky 67–59 in the first round of the Southeast Regional. Before the tournament began, Iba became aware athletic director Bob Devaney was reaching out to coaches across to gauge their interest in Nebraska's coaching position. He resigned following the game.\nDanny Nee (1986–2000).\nOn March 27, 1986, Danny Nee was introduced as Nebraska's twenty-fourth basketball coach. During his introductory press conference, Nee said a \"new era\" in NU basketball was beginning. Nee's fourteen teams appeared in the postseason eleven times and topped the twenty-win mark in seven seasons. In his first season, Nebraska was 21–12 and finished third in the NIT. Nebraska missed postseason play in each of the following three seasons, but won a school-record twenty-six games in 1990–91. The Cornhuskers reached the Big Eight Tournament championship game for the first time and advanced to the NCAA Tournament, where they were upset by No. 14 seed Xavier in the first round. The 1990–91 team included two future first-round NBA draft picks, senior Rich King and redshirt freshman Eric Piatkowski. The 7-ft 2-in. King was the tallest player in program history. Piatkowski, Nebraska's sixth man in 1990–91, went on to earn first-team all-conference honors twice. He ranks second on the Cornhuskers' career scoring list with 1,934 points and is the only Nebraska player to finish with at least 1,900 points, 600 rebounds (669) and 300 assists (322). In 2006, Piatkowski (No. 52) joined Hoppen and Stu Lantz (No. 22) as the only players to have their number retired.\nThree more NCAA Tournament appearances followed the record-breaking 1991 season. In 1992–93, the Huskers tied for second place in the Big Eight, their highest league finish under Nee. In addition to reaching a fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament and recording back-to-back twenty-win seasons for the first time in school history, Nee's 1993–94 team won the school's first conference tournament title. The Cornhuskers defeated Oklahoma, Missouri, and Oklahoma State to win the Big Eight Tournament.\nNebraska's NCAA Tournament run ended at four in 1994–95, but the Cornhuskers kept their postseason streak alive with an NIT berth, advancing to the second round. The 1995–96 team again failed to reach the NCAA Tournament, but capped its season with a run to the NIT title. NU won two games on the road and scored more than eighty points in four of their five postseason games, finishing with a 60–56 victory over St. Joseph's. The 1996 NIT championship team was one of the most talented in school history. Two future NBA players, Erick Strickland and 1998 first-round draft pick Tyronn Lue, started in the backcourt. Two others scored 1,000 career points, Jaron Boone and freshman Venson Hamilton, who finished his career in 1999 as the school's all-time leading rebounder and shot-blocker. Lue, a six-foot point guard, finished his career as the seventh-leading scorer in school history, and ranked in the top ten in twelve other categories. He led the Cornhuskers to the 1997 NIT in Nebraska's first season in the Big 12 Conference.\nBehind Nebraska's longest conference winning streak in twenty years, Nee's twelfth team at NU finished fourth in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA Tournament. The bid was the Cornhuskers' fifth during the 1990s and extended a school-record postseason streak to eight years. The streak reached nine in 1999 when Big 12 Player of the Year Venson Hamilton led the Cornhuskers to the second round of the NIT. The 1999–2000 season quickly fell apart when guard Cookie Belcher was sidelined by a wrist injury; the team finished 11–19 and tied the school record for losses in a season. Nee was fired just days after a 69–64 win over Colorado made him the winningest coach in school history.\nBarry Collier (2000–06).\nDirector of Athletics Bill Byrne hired Barry Collier as the Cornhuskers' new coach on April 5, 2000. In Collier's first season, Nebraska finished 14–16 as Belcher returned to the lineup and earned second-team All-Big 12 honors. He finished his career with 353 steals, the third-most in NCAA history. In Collier's fourth season, Nebraska finished 18–13 and earned its first postseason bid in five years. Nebraska won its first two games in the 2004 NIT, including a thrilling 71–70 road victory over in-state rival Creighton in the opening round. NU nearly overcame a seventeen-point halftime deficit in the third round, but lost to Hawaii by one point.\nDespite a lackluster season for the program, freshman center Aleks Marić, the first Australian to play in the program, broke the NU freshman record for rebounds and double-doubles. He finished his four-year career fifth all-time in scoring and was only the second Husker to record 1,000 career rebounds. NU rebounded to finish 19–14 and make its second postseason appearance in three years in 2006, the program's most wins under Collier and the first time his Huskers won a Big 12 Tournament game. NU reached the semifinals of the conference tournament for the first time since winning the Big Eight Tournament in 1994. Collier abruptly resigned in August pf 2006 to become the athletic director at his alma mater Butler, ending his career at Nebraska with an 89–91 record.\nDoc Sadler (2006–12).\nThe late job opening created by Collier's abrupt resignation was filled in just one week, when Doc Sadler was introduced as the twenty-sixth head coach in program history. Sadler's program saw limited success through his six seasons in Lincoln, finishing above .500 four times but winning only one postseason game and failing to reach the NCAA Tournament.\nNebraska led the Big 12 in scoring defense in Sadler's second season, allowing just 60.7 points per game. NU led the Big 12 again the following season and ranked just outside the top twenty nationally at 60.4 points against per game, the second-lowest total for NU since 1951. This allowed NU to reach .500 in conference play for the first time in ten seasons. Despite typically lackluster offensive performances, Sadler's strong defenses earned him eighty-nine victories through his first five seasons in Lincoln, the highest total in school history. He was the second NU coach to reach the postseason twice in his first three seasons and the second since World War II with three winning seasons in his first four years. Led by another strong defensive unit that ranked seventh nationally in field goal percentage against (.389), NU defeated three ranked teams during the 2010–11 season, reaching the NIT to mark the school's third postseason appearance in four seasons under Sadler.\nThe University of Nebraska–Lincoln joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011 and later that year the school opened the Hendricks Training Complex, a basketball training and practice facility attached to the Devaney Center. After a disappointing 12–18 season in 2011–12, athletic director Tom Osborne fired Sadler after six seasons. At the press conference to address his firing, an emotional Sadler addressed the media: \"I wanted to be the guy that won the first NCAA Tournament game. It didn’t happen. That's the bottom line. We can all sit here and talk about this that whatever. It all comes down to winning. That's what it should come down to.\"\nTim Miles (2012–19).\nTim Miles was hired as Nebraska's head basketball coach on March 24, 2012 after a five-year stint at Colorado State. In his second season, the Cornhuskers moved to Pinnacle Bank Arena after thirty-seven years at the Devaney Center. Their first game in the new arena was an exhibition game against Nebraska-Kearney on November 4, 2013, followed four days later by their first regular season game against Florida Gulf Coast. Behind a 15–1 record at \"The Vault,\" Miles led the Cornhuskers to the program's first NCAA Tournament berth since 1998, but NU lost to Baylor in the first round. Despite appearing in the preseason AP Poll for the first time in twenty years, Nebraska finished under .500 in 2014–15 and did not have a winning record again until 2017–18. On February 6, 2017, Nebraska suffered their worst home defeat in program history, closing the regular season with a thirty-six-point loss to Michigan. After two NIT appearances in the following seasons, Miles was fired on March 26, 2019.\nFred Hoiberg (2019–present).\nOn March 30, 2019, the University of Nebraska announced that Fred Hoiberg had been hired as its head coach. NU lost at least twenty games in each of Hoiberg's first three seasons, the first such seasons in program history. The 2022-23 season looked to be the same until the Huskers won 5 of their 7 final games to finish 16-16. The positive momentum carried into the 2023-24 season where NU finished 3rd in the Big Ten and earned an 8 seed in the NCAA Tournament. A first round loss to Texas A&amp;M ended the season, but the team still finished with the second best record in program history at 23-11.\nHoiberg has produced 2 current NBA players in his tenure at Nebraska, Dalano Banton and Bryce McGowens\nRivalries.\nNebraska maintains an annual intrastate rivalry with the Creighton Bluejays. The teams have met fifty-five times and have played each season since 1977. Creighton has won twenty of the twenty-four matchups since 1999 and leads the all-time series 29–26. NU has defeated Creighton in both of their postseason matchups, in the 1984 and 2004 NIT.\nVenues.\nDevaney Center.\nThe Devaney Center opened in 1976 with a capacity of 13,595, replacing the Nebraska Coliseum as the primary home venue for Nebraska's basketball programs. Initially called the NU Sports Complex, it was later named for College Football Hall of Fame head coach Bob Devaney, who led Nebraska's football program to two national championships and served as athletic director for twenty-five years. Nebraska's men's team played at the Devaney Center from 1976 until 2013, compiling a record of 477–148 in its thirty-seven years at the arena. The highest attendance recorded at the arena was 15,038, a 62–54 Nebraska win over Oklahoma State on February 7, 1981. While Pinnacle Bank Arena became NU's home venue in 2013, both programs practice and train at the Hendricks Training Complex at the Devaney Center.\nPinnacle Bank Arena.\nPinnacle Bank Arena, also known as \"The Vault\", is a 15,500-seat indoor arena in Lincoln's Haymarket District. It was completed in 2013 and replaced the Devaney Center as the home of the Nebraska's men's and women's basketball teams.\nA turn back tax to support a $25 million bond for a new arena in downtown Lincoln was approved by local voters on May 11, 2010; Pinnacle Bank purchased the naming rights in a 25-year, $11.25 million agreement. The first event at the new arena was NU's 2013 summer commencement ceremony, and the first concert was held a month later when Michael Bublé performed to a sold-out crowd on September 13. Nebraska's first men's basketball game at Pinnacle Bank Arena was on November 8, 2013, a 79–55 win over FGCU. The Cornhuskers went 15–1 at Pinnacle Bank Arena in its inaugural season.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Cornhuskers have appeared in the NCAA tournament eight times with a combined record of 0–8. Nebraska is the only power conference school that has never won a tournament game.\nNIT results.\nThe Cornhuskers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament nineteen times with a combined record of 24–18. They won the tournament in 1996.\nPlayers.\nIn the NBA.\nNebraska has had 15 former men's basketball players appear in at least one NBA game."

        "text": "George W. \"Tank\" McLaren (August 29, 1896 – November 13, 1967) was an American football and basketball player and coach. Playing at the University of Pittsburgh under legendary football coach Pop Warner, McLaren was an All-American in 1917 and 1918. During his playing career, he was never stopped for a loss on a running play. McLaren served as head football coach at Emporia State University, then known as Kansas State Normal College, (1919), the University of Arkansas (1920–1921), the University of Cincinnati (1922–1926), and the University of Wyoming (1927–1929), compiling a career record of 32–55–8. He also coached basketball at Wyoming for two seasons (1928–1930), tallying a mark of 28–10. McLaren was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1965.\nEarly life.\nMcLaren grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he attended and graduated from Peabody High School. He played football at Peabody and competed in several other sports including track, basketball, and swimming.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh.\nMcLaren attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he was considered one of the greatest all-around athletes that Pitt ever produced. In addition to being a football All-American, he was also a two-year member of the basketball and track teams. McLaren played four varsity seasons as fullback at Pittsburgh from 1915 to 1918. While playing for the Panthers he only lost one game while winning thirty decisions. He was a member of three national championship-winning teams under head coach Glenn \"Pop\" Warner. In 1916, the Panthers beat several national powers while not giving up a single point. During the next two seasons McLaren won All-America honors. In 1917 season, McLaren helped the Panthers to a 10–0 record. That season, he established single season school records when he scored 13 touchdowns and rushed for 782 yards including a then record 91-yard touchdown against Syracuse University.\nPitt's undefeated 1917 team was known as \"The Fighting Dentists\" because on occasion every position was filled by dental students. The dental students on the 1917 team included McLaren, Katy Easterday, Skip Gougler, \"Jake\" Stahl, and Jock Sutherland.\nIn 1918, his senior season, he served as Captain of the Panther football team and was also president of his senior class.

One of McLaren's most noted achievements was that he was never stopped for a loss on a running play.\nCollege coach.\nMcLaren was a college football coach from 1919 to 1929. In 1919, McLaren was named as head football coach at Emporia State University, then known as Kansas State Normal College, in Emporia, Kansas. He got the position based on a recommendation by Pop Warner. He became 11th head football coach for Emporia State and held that position for just the 1919 season. His overall coaching record at ESU was 1–5–2. This ranks him 20th at ESU in terms of total wins and 19th at ESU in terms of winning percentage. He next served as the head football coach at Arkansas, where he compiled an 8–5–3 record. As Arkansas head football coach McLaren personally was a very popular coach but was let go because number of wins did not meet expectations. From 1922 to 1926, he coached at Cincinnati, where he compiled a 16–26–3 record. From 1927 to 1929, he coached at Wyoming, where he compiled a 7–19 record.

        "title": "James Street (American football)",
        "text": "James Lowell Street (August 2, 1948 – September 30, 2013) was a two-sport star athlete at the University of Texas. As quarterback, he led the team to the 1969 National Championship in football and posted a perfect 20-0 record, the most wins without a loss in Longhorns history. As a pitcher he was a two time All-American who threw the only perfect game in University of Texas history.\nEarly life.\nJames Street was born in 1948 in Longview, Texas, the son of Helen Frederick (Eaton) and Grover Wilson Street, Sr. He had a hardscrabble childhood that became more difficult at 12 when his parents divorced and his father moved back to Oklahoma. James worked odd jobs in junior high and high school to help feed him and his twin sister. At Longview High School he lettered in football, baseball, basketball and track, but was not heavily recruited.\nHis brother Sewell Street played two years of minor league baseball in the Cardinals organization in Wytheville and Keokuk.\nFootball career.\nStreet arrived at Texas as a seventh-string quarterback in 1966.\nAfter playing only a handful of plays in two blowout games in 1967, Street came into the 1968 season as the backup to Bill Bradley. That year, Darrell Royal and assistant Emory Bellard introduced the wishbone. After tying #11 Houston in the first game and a slow start in the second against Texas Tech, Street took over at quarterback. \"Hell, you can’t do any worse. Get in there,\" Royal reportedly said when replacing Bradley with Street. Despite running up 22 points in the 3rd quarter, Texas would lose that game, but Street would never find himself on the losing side again. He engineered the Longhorns' offense from that game to the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, reeling off 20 straight wins without a loss. He ended his junior year playing what may have been the best game of his career in the 1969 Cotton Bowl against Tennessee. In that game he twice broke the school record for longest touchdown pass in a bowl game, first with a 78-yard TD pass to Cotton Speyrer in the 1st quarter and then with a 79-yard TD pass in the 3rd. He threw for 200 yards and was named one of the game's three \"Outstanding Players.\"\nAs a starting quarterback in his senior campaign, he led the Longhorns to a perfect season, beating Arkansas in \"The Game of the Century\" for one half of the National Championship and Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic for the other half. The Arkansas game is the one for which he is best known. In that game he ran for a crucial 42-yard touchdown and hit Randy Peschel on a game-saving fourth-and-3 to set up the winning touchdown. The Longhorns were declared National Champions by President Richard Nixon, who had attended the game. In the 1970 Cotton Bowl, Street led the Longhorns to a come-from-behind win after Notre Dame took a 10-point lead. In the 4th quarter, down by 3, he initiated a game-winning touchdown drive that featured two fourth down conversions. The last was converted on a Street pass, thrown under duress and short, that was caught by a diving Speyrer just before it hit the ground. Texas scored the game-winning touchdown with 1:08 on the clock. After the game, he was congratulated by former President Lyndon Johnson who had attended the game.\nRecords.\nBold means still active\nBaseball career.\nStreet was a two-time 2nd Team All-American baseball player who posted a 29-8 record on the mound. He made the All-Southwest Conference Team three years in a row and was the team's MVP every year. In 1968, he led the team in wins, ERA, innings pitched and strikeouts. He threw a no-hitter in 1969 versus SMU and another in 1970 versus Texas Tech. The Texas Tech no-hitter was a perfect game, the only one in the history of the Southwest Conference or the University of Texas. He helped Texas win three Southwest Conference titles and go to three straight College World Series, finishing as high as 3rd in 1970.\nLater life.\nStreet was drafted in the 31st round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft by the Cleveland Indians, but after suffering an injury at the 1970 College World Series he chose not to play in the Indians' farm system, thereby ending his career.\nIn 1991, Street started a successful career as a settlement planner, owning his own business, The James Street Group. He had five sons, including three who won National Championships playing baseball for Texas. His oldest son Ryan Street, from his first marriage attended Texas Tech. Street and his wife of 32 years, Janie Street had four sons, former Longhorn and Los Angeles Angels closer Huston Street, former Longhorn and minor league pitcher Juston Street, former Longhorn pitcher Jordon Street and Pepperdine infielder Hanson Street who earned an MBA at the Red McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas. Juston Street went into acting, and one of his first film appearances was playing his father, James Street, in the film \"My All American\".\nStreet died of a heart attack at his home in Austin, Texas, on September 30, 2013."

He was a six-time Pro Bowler and a three-time All-Pro. He played college football for the Iowa Hawkeyes.\nIn 2021, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Niland to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2021.\nEarly years.\nNiland was raised by his adopted family and attended Amityville Memorial High School, where he was an All-State fullback.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Iowa, where he started out as a fullback, before being converted into an offensive tackle and becoming a starter at right tackle as a sophomore. He was moved to offensive guard as a junior.\nNiland was an All-American selection his senior year in (1965) and also a second-team All-American selection in 1964 by the Newspaper Enterprise Association.\nIn 1989, he was named to the Iowa All-time Football Team. In 2006, he was inducted into the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame.\nNiland was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Football Category with the Class of 1997.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nNiland was selected in the first round (fifth overall) of the 1966 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys, becoming the first offensive lineman in franchise history to be drafted in the first round. He was also selected by the Oakland Raiders in the thirteenth round (116th overall) of the 1966 AFL Draft.\nAs a rookie, Niland started four games at offensive tackle in place of an injured Jim Boeke. In 1967, his emergence as the starting left guard, allowed the team to move Tony Liscio to left tackle.\nNiland was the starter at left guard from 1966 to 1974. One of the top offensive linemen of his era, he excelled as a pulling guard.\nPracticing against Bob Lilly, beginning in his rookie year, helped Niland become a Pro Bowler and solidified an offensive line that won two NFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl. He was nicknamed Johnny Nightlife by his teammates, because of his thirst for the nightlife.\nAs a rookie, Niland started in the 1966 NFL Championship Game and later in the 1967 NFL Championship Game, famously known as the \"Ice Bowl\", both Cowboy losses, playing next to left tackle Tony Liscio and opposite right defensive tackle Lionel Aldridge of the Green Bay Packers.\nThe Cowboys eventually won the NFC Championship Game during the 1970-71 NFL playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers, due in large part to Duane Thomas's 143 yards on the ground, but lost in Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts. However, in the following year, they defeated again the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game of the 1971-72 NFL playoffs and then the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI. In the latter game, Niland and Liscio overwhelmed Bob Heinz and Bill Stanfill, respectively, leading Duane Thomas and others to a whopping 252 yards on the ground.\nAlong with Rayfield Wright, Nate Newton, Larry Allen, Tyron Smith and Zack Martin, Niland is one of only six offensive lineman in team history with at least six Pro Bowl selections. He was selected to six consecutive Pro Bowls from 1968 to 1973 and was a three-time All-Pro selection, while only missing two games in his nine seasons with the Cowboys.\nOn September 14, 1975, he was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for a third round draft choice (#62-Tony Hill).\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nIn 1975, he started 13 games at left guard after missing the season opener with a hamstring injury. The next year, he tore ligaments in his left knee during a training camp practice and was placed on the injured reserve list.\nPersonal life.\nNiland served military duty at Fort Hood."

        "text": "Thomas Edward Bolton (born May 6, 1962) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1987 through 1994 for the Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, and Baltimore Orioles. Listed at and , he batted and threw left-handed.\nBiography.\nA native of Nashville, Tennessee, Bolton helped lead Antioch High School to the Tennessee High School Class AAA state championship in 1979, his junior year. His overall win–loss record as a high school pitcher was 26–4. Bolton was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 20th round of the 1980 MLB draft.\nBolton's professional baseball career spanned 1980 to 1998, as he appeared in Minor League Baseball during 16 seasons and in MLB during eight seasons. He moved back and forth between being a starting pitcher and being a relief pitcher. He reached MLB in 1987 with the Red Sox, playing in parts of six seasons with them before moving to three other teams late in this career.\nBolton's most productive season came in 1990 with Boston, when he had a 10–5 mark with a 3.38 earned run average (ERA) in 16 starts. He made his only major league postseason appearances that season, pitching a total of three scoreless innings in two games of the 1990 ALCS, as the Red Sox were swept by the Oakland Athletics.\nIn 1991, Bolton recorded a high-career 19 starts, but went 8–9 with a 5.24 ERA. In July 1992, he was sent to the Cincinnati Reds in the trade that brought Billy Hatcher to the Red Sox. After that, Bolton was used mostly as a middle reliever and left-handed specialist. He spent his last two seasons with the Detroit Tigers (1993) and Baltimore Orioles (1994).\nIn an eight-season MLB career, Bolton posted a 31–34 record with a 4.56 ERA and 336 strikeouts in 209 appearances, including 56 starts, three complete games, and innings pitched. He had one save in MLB, which came on August 13, 1988, during a blowout victory against the Tigers, as Bolton pitched the final three innings of 16–4 win. As a batter, Bolton was hitless in 14 major league at bats, all occurring with Cincinnati in 1992. As a fielder, he committed six errors in 117 total chances, for a .949 fielding percentage.\nBolton pitched in the Pacific Coast League for the Calgary Cannons (1996–1997), Tucson Toros (1997) and Nashville Sounds (1998). He was also an assistant pitching coach with the Sounds. In 16 minor league seasons, Bolton went 79–71 with 841 strikeouts and a 3.88 ERA in innings.\nBolton was inducted to the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools sports hall of fame in 2008. He has served as a board member of the Nashville Old Timers Baseball Association. Bolton and his wife, Diane, have three children.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Almanac"

The league is operated by the Croatian Ice Hockey Federation.\nHistory.\nThe league was formed in 1991 with the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Until then, Croatian teams played in the Yugoslav Ice Hockey League. The hockey teams Mladost and Medveščak were playing in the first division, while Sisak and Zagreb were playing in the second division of the Yugoslav league. The former two were much stronger, but as financing went away their best players did not stay with the clubs. This resulted in a more balanced competition, in which KHL Zagreb went on to win three times in a row. Medveščak however managed to remerge as the country's dominant team, as it won the competition for eleven straight seasons.\nDue to the very short duration of the season, Croatian teams often play in other leagues, such as the Slohokej League, Erste Bank Eishockey Liga, Interliga and Panonian League."

It was fully made up of professional players from the Philippine Basketball Association. This was the first time that the country ever sent a national team made up of professionals players. However, unlike the United States' Dream Team, this team was called such because its main goal was to wrest back Asian basketball supremacy from teams such as China. The nickname was given only recently, after the failures of the succeeding all-pro national teams in the FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, more than a decade after the team had finished competing in the said tournament.\nFormation.\nIn 1989, FIBA made a rule change for an \"open basketball\", which would allow players in professional, commercial or club ranks to play in any international events instead of the old ruling of only allowing amateur players. This led to the PBA and the Basketball Association of the Philippines forging a deal to have an all-pro squad to send a team to the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. The team consist of some of the greatest players in Philippine basketball and about half of the team were named in the PBA Top 25 all-time Greatest Players ten years later.\nAñejo Rum playing coach Robert Jaworski was named head coach of the squad with San Miguel Beer head coach Norman Black as assistant coach. With only two weeks to prepare, Jaworski assembled the lineup made of some of the best players in the league:\nFour players were taken from San Miguel, a year after they won the coveted Grand Slam, with Jaworski inserting former teammate and former rival Mon Fernandez in the lineup. Cuenco, Gonzalgo and Loyzaga, players for Jaworski's Añejo squad were included in the list. Purefoods center Jerry Codinera was originally named in the 12-man line-up but was stricken with hepatitis weeks before the Games and eventually replaced by Zaldy Realubit. Nelson Asaytono and Paul Alvarez were part of the pool as alternates though they did not join the team to Beijing.\nAsian Games.\nThe Philippines won their first three assignments against Pakistan, Japan and North Korea by an average of 24 points. However, the Filipinos lost in their fourth assignment against host China with a score of 125–60. The team came from behind to beat United Arab Emirates and repeated against Japan in the semifinals, 94–90, to set up a rematch against China in the championship game.\nIn the championship, China defeated the Philippines 90–74, a far better performance from their 65-point blowout in their first meeting. The silver medal finish was the Philippines' best since winning the 1962 Asian Games. Another consolation the team got were the inclusion of Allan Caidic and Samboy Lim in the tournament's mythical five selection.\nAftermath.\nThe Philippines sent another all-pro squad in the next three Asian Games. The 1994 team was made up mostly of the San Miguel Beer squad, an incentive for winning the All-Filipino Cup championship. However, depleted by injuries, San Miguel acquired players from other teams along with amateur such as Alvin Patrimonio, Jerry Codiñera, Johnny Abarrientos, Marlou Aquino and Kenneth Duremdes. But the country went home without a medal finishing fourth behind China, South Korea and Japan.\nIn 1998, the a third all-PBA squad was sent and was dubbed as the Philippine Centennial Team coached by Tim Cone. Led by Abarrientos, Duremdes, Aquino, Patrimonio and Vergel Meneses, the country failed to win the gold medal after losing by nine points to China with future NBA player Wang Zhizhi in the semifinals. The country was relegated to a third-place game against Kazashztan and won the bronze medal in close-fought match.\nFour years later in Busan, the country went home empty-handed after a disappointing fourth-place finish. The Filipinos, mostly led by Filipino-American players, were handed a heart-breaking loss to host South Korea in the semis thanks to a Lee Sang-Min buzzer-beating three-pointer. The next day, the Philippines lost to the Kazazhs for the bronze medal. Jong Uichico coached the 2002 squad.\nThe PBA was supposed to abandon the Asian Games for the FIBA-Asia Championships, which at stake is a World Championship or an Olympic slot, after a 2004 deal with the BAP. But a two-year suspension was handed out denying the country a chance to play for those events mentioned including the 2006 Doha Asian Games. The country has since been lifted off the suspension after the formation of the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas."

        "text": "Tony West (born 7 July 1972) is an English former professional darts player.\nDarts career.\nBDO career.\nWinmau World Masters.\nWest's biggest successes have come at the Winmau World Masters. He reached the final in 2002 but was beaten by 7-4 by Mark Dudbridge. In 2003, he made the semi-finals where he played Ted Hankey. Hankey went 5–4 in front in their best of 11 match, and started celebrating after making a high outshot to win the set. However, this proved premature as West recovered to win the match 6–5. In the final, West played Raymond van Barneveld, who had won the year's three preceding Grand Slam events and was looking to complete his set. It looked likely as van Barneveld took an early lead, but West improved his form and took it to a deciding set. At 5–4 to West in the set they were within one leg of playing a sudden-death leg, but West managed to break van Barneveld's throw and win the title.\nBDO World Championship.\nWest reached the last 16 of the 2004 BDO World Championship, where he lost to eventual champion Andy Fordham.\nSince 2004, West's form has slumped somewhat and he failed to qualify for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 World Championships. He did however qualify for the 2010 tournament, reaching the second round before losing to Dave Chisnall. In 2011 he lost in the first round to champion Martin Adams, while the following year he lost at the same stage to Belgian Geert De Vos.\nOther events.\nWest has won one Open event, the Portland Open in 2004, and one pairs Open event, also at the Portland Open in 2006.\nPDC career.\nIn January 2012, he entered the Professional Darts Corporation Pro Tour 'Q School' qualifying tournament, one of several BDO players to do so, including his brother Steve and Dean Winstanley. On the first day of 'Q School', West beat Keegan Brown 6–4 to gain a 2012 PDC ProTour Card, gaining him automatic access to all UK Open qualifiers, Players Championship and European Tour events. In his first 19 events on the PDC tour West's best finishes were two last 32 exits in Pro Tour events. \nIn August, he beat Daniel Day and Jim Walker in the UK Qualifier for the European Tour Event 4, and in the first round in Stuttgart, West enjoyed a 6–5 victory over world number 11 Justin Pipe in the first round. He played fellow qualifier Terry Temple in round two and won 6–4, before claiming the biggest win of his PDC career to date when he defeated Terry Jenkins 6–4 to advance to his first ever PDC quarter-final. He played reigning two-time world champion Adrian Lewis and lost 3–6. West also qualified for the fifth European Tour Event of the year, the Dutch Darts Masters, and was narrowly beaten 5–6 by Brendan Dolan in the first round. He finished 52nd on the 2012 ProTour Order of Merit, just £400 short of claiming one of the sixteen spots awarded to the highest non-qualified players for the 2013 World Championship.\nWest lost 5–3 to Jake Pennington in the first round of the 2013 UK Open. He only played in six more events in the rest of the year and finished it outside the top 64 meaning he needed to enter Q School to regain his place. However, the Netherlands-based West decided not to register for the event and instead concentrated on European Tour tournaments in 2014. He entered three qualifiers and failed to reach the main event in all of them.\nWest qualified for the 2016 European Darts Grand Prix, his first European tour event in three years, and beat Jeffrey de Graaf 6–2, before losing 6–3 to Michael Smith. He also played in the German Darts Championship and met brother Steve in the first round, who averaged 109.98 in a 6–0 whitewash."

        "title": "Rowing stroke",
        "text": "In rowing, the stroke is the action of moving the oar through the water in order to propel the boat forward. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the \"catch\" where the oar blade is placed in the water, and the \"extraction\" (also known as the 'finish', 'release' or 'tapping down') where the oar blade is removed from the water. After the blade is placed in the water at the \"catch\", the rower applies pressure to the oar levering the boat forward which is called the \"drive\" phase of the stroke. Once the rower extracts the oar from the water, the \"recovery\" phase begins, setting up the rower's body for the next stroke.\nStages of a stroke.\nDrive.\nThe drive is the phase from the catch to the extraction.\nRecovery.\nThe recovery follows the drive and returns the oar and the rower from the point of extraction to the catch.\nSweep vs sculling.\nSweep rowers (one oar per person) and scullers (two oars, one in each hand) have similar stroke styles, with some differences to accommodate the number of oars held by the rower. The most notable difference is that the oar handles overlap in sculling at the midpoint of the drive, and again during the recovery. This requires the sculler to cross one hand over (left over right) and/or in front of the other hand to avoid the oar handles colliding. While sculling is a fully symmetrical movement (with exception of the handle overlap), sweep oar rowing is slightly asymmetrical and many rowers strongly prefer one side to the other.\nAlso, sweep oar rowers usually feather and square the oar with the inside hand (the one closer to the rowlock), allowing the handle to turn within the outside hand, whose wrist remains flat throughout. This is obviously not possible in sculling, and scullers tend to feather and square by holding the oar handle in the extended fingers when feathered, and rolling it into the palm of the hand to square it, the wrist remaining flat throughout. \nThe average speed of a boat increases with the crew size and sculling boats are slightly faster than the equivalent sweep boats.\nLocal differences.\nThe rowing stroke differs slightly depending on location and coaching technique and especially the coach. Differences (especially between experienced rowers) are only marginal and can often only be seen by detailed video-analysis. For example, sometimes the Canadian eight team used a style where the body was swung more during the drive."

        "title": "Gary Anderson (darts player)",
        "text": "Gary James Grant Anderson (born 22 December 1970) is a Scottish professional darts player playing in events of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Nicknamed \"The Flying Scotsman\", after the famous steam train, he is a former BDO and WDF world number one, and a two-time PDC World Champion, having won the title in 2015 and 2016. He is regarded as one of the best darts players of all time.\nAnderson is renowned for his heavy scoring in the game and having one of the smoothest throws. Anderson is a two-time back-to-back PDC World Champion, defeating Phil Taylor 7–6 in the 2015 final and Adrian Lewis 7–5 in 2016, while he was also a finalist in 2011, 2017 and 2021. His other career highlights include winning the International Darts League in 2007, the World Darts Trophy in 2007, the Zuiderduin Masters in 2007 and 2008, the Premier League in 2011 and 2015, the Players Championship Finals in 2014, the UK Open in 2018, World Matchplay in 2018, the Champions League of Darts in 2018 and the 2019 PDC World Cup of Darts. He has also won 36 PDC Pro Tour events as of April 2024, putting him third on the all-time list behind Michael van Gerwen on 88 and Phil Taylor on 70.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nBorn in Musselburgh, Anderson began his career playing in British Darts Organisation events and won the second tournament he entered by claiming the 2001 Welsh Open with a defeat of John Walton. The win ensured he qualified for the following year's World Championship for the first time, where he suffered a first round defeat to Sweden's Stefan Nagy, going down 3–0. \nThe following year, in the 2003 BDO World Darts Championship Anderson reached the semi-final stage before bowing out to eventual runner-up Ritchie Davies.\nAnderson would not win another match at the Lakeside Country Club until 2006, when he beat Gary Robson in the first round before again falling to the eventual finalist this time in Raymond van Barneveld in the second round.\nIn the following two years, Anderson was knocked out of the World Championship in the first round by Dutch players – in 2007, he lost to Albertino Essers, and in 2008, he was defeated by Fabian Roosenbrand.\nMajor successes and PDC switch.\nAnderson won the first major tournaments of his career by claiming the International Darts League and World Darts Trophy back-to-back in 2007. It was a significant achievement as he succeeded against fields comprising the top players and world champions from both the rival organisations: the Professional Darts Corporation and BDO. In the two events, he had victories against Wayne Mardle, Roland Scholten, Mervyn King, James Wade, Adrian Lewis, Mark Webster, John Part, Peter Manley, Andy Hamilton and Phil Taylor.\nShortly after his WDT title, his success continued by clinching the BDO British Open to add to his 2007 Scottish Open success. Anderson also won the Zuiderduin Masters two years in a row – the first of which was an unranked event, the second was the first championship since the tournament was elevated to the status of ranking major. Anderson finished 2007 as the WDF world number 1, while he later ended 2008 as the WDF world number 2 behind Scott Waites In 2008, Anderson won the German Open, Welsh Open and BDO International Grand Prix titles. He also won the Dutch Pentathlon in 2008, retaining the title in 2009, with a world record score of 502 points.\nBetween 2000 and 2008, Anderson represented Scotland at three WDF World Cups, four WDF Europe Cups, and five Six Nations Cup. With Scotland, Anderson lifted successive Six Nations Cups in 2002 and 2003, as well as winning the WDF Europe Cup four-man and overall team titles in 2002. In total, Anderson played thirty-two matches for Scotland, winning twenty-two of them.\nAfter months of speculation, Anderson joined the PDC in early 2009. He made his PDC televised debut in an exhibition match at the Premier League Darts meeting in Cardiff, after Wayne Mardle had withdrawn with illness, and defeated John Part with a three-dart average of 107. He then qualified for the 2009 UK Open at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, losing in the second round 6–4 to Paul Nicholson.\nOn his PDC World Championship debut in 2010, Anderson defeated Jamie Caven 3–2 in the first round before losing 4–0 against Ronnie Baxter in the second round.\n2010.\nIn June 2010, Anderson reached his first ever PDC major final at the UK Open. He defeated Michael van Gerwen, Paul Nicholson, Mervyn King (who hit a nine-dart finish against Anderson), Andy Hamilton, and Tony Ayres before losing to Phil Taylor in the final 5–11.\nAt the 2010 World Matchplay he produced the first whitewash for six years with a 10–0 thumping of fellow Scot Robert Thornton during their first round encounter. His second round encounter was against Jelle Klaasen, with Klaasen winning 14–12.\nAnderson qualified for the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, and went into the tournament as the number six seed. Anderson defeated Mark Hylton, Mark Webster and Wayne Jones in the group stage to finish top of his group. In the second round he defeated Colin Osborne 10–3 to again play Jones in the quarter finals. Anderson led 15–12 before Jones took the last four legs to win the match 16–15.\nAnderson represented Scotland along with Robert Thornton for the inaugural PDC World Cup of Darts in 2010 PDC World Cup of Darts. They entered the tournament in the second round as 4th seeds and beat Russia, paired by Anastasia Dobromyslova and Roman Konchikov, 6–2 to advance to the group stage, where they lost their opening group game to Wales pairing Mark Webster and Barrie Bates. Having recovered to secure victory against Bill Davis and Darin Young of the United States, Anderson and Thornton went out after defeat to Spain's Carlos Rodriguez and Antonio Alcinas.\n2011.\nAnderson qualified for the 2011 World Championship as the number 11 seed and in the first round played Japan's Morihiro Hashimoto. Anderson won 3–0 in sets, taking all nine legs without reply, with an average of 103.23. In the second round he faced two-time world champion Dennis Priestley, winning 4 sets to 2. He then defeated Andy Smith in the third round (whilst setting his highest World Championship average of 108.39), Raymond van Barneveld in the quarter-finals, and Terry Jenkins in the semi-finals to ensure his place in the final against Adrian Lewis. Anderson was defeated 7–5 by Lewis, who also hit a nine-dart finish during the first set of the match. Despite the loss, Anderson's run ensured him a place in the 2011 Premier League as he had moved into the top four on the Order of Merit.\nAnderson was the number two seed for the 2011 Players Championship Finals, and reached his second successive major final, where he played Phil Taylor. Anderson led 11–9, but Taylor checked out 128 in the deciding leg to win 13–12.\nIn the Premier League he got off to a winning start by beating Simon Whitlock 8–5 on the opening night at the O2 Arena. He went on to win his first four games before losing to Taylor in week five. Anderson finished the group stage in third place and played Van Barneveld in the semi-finals, winning 8–6. In a repeat of the World Championship final he played Lewis (who had beaten Taylor 8–3 in the other semi-final) and beat him 10–4 to win his first major championship in the PDC, his third in total, and his first in the UK having had his previous successes in the Netherlands.\nIn the World Matchplay he was beaten 10–6 in his first round match against Andy Hamilton, and he lost in the second round of the European Championship 10–5 to Peter Wright. Away from the television cameras on the PDC Pro Tour he won four Players Championships during the year including both during the same weekend in Nuland. In the first round of the World Grand Prix he faced Richie Burnett and lost 2–1 in sets.\nAnderson qualified from Group C of the Grand Slam of Darts and then won through to the final where he met Taylor and was comfortably beaten 16–4.\nAnderson holds the record for the highest ever three dart average in darts history in an official tournament with a 133.35 average in a 6–1 win against Arron Monk in a UK Open Qualifier during 2011.\n2012.\nAnderson survived a huge scare in the first round of the 2012 World Championship as his opponent Jyhan Artut had four darts to win the match. He missed and Anderson won the match 3–2 on a sudden-death leg. He used his lucky escape to his advantage by defeating Devon Petersen and Colin Lloyd, 4–2 and 4–1 respectively, to set up a quarter-final clash with Simon Whitlock. He won the first set of the match, but missed a total of 29 darts at a double and lost 1–5.\nHe played in his second World Cup for Scotland in February, this time with Peter Wright and together they were beaten by South Africa in the second round, losing in a sudden-death leg.\nAnderson had a disappointing defence of his Premier League title. He finished bottom of the league table having won just three matches from the 14-game season. In winning the event in 2011 he made a total of 79 180's, but could only manage 31 this year, the least of any of the eight players. However, in the last league game Anderson did have an encouraging 7–7 draw with Phil Taylor.\nIn June, he completed his first live televised nine-dart finish in a 9–3 third round win over Davey Dodds at the UK Open. He lost in the next round to compatriot, and eventual winner of the event, Robert Thornton 7–9. He was then forced to take a month away from the sport due to problems focusing with his left eye, returning to play in the World Matchplay. There he played Dean Winstanley in the first round and, despite leading 5–0, lost the match 11–13. Anderson was banned by the Darts Regulation Authority for two European Tour events and the European Championship due to \"him failing to complete his match and his subsequent behaviour\" at the European Tour Event 2. In October, he lost in the final of the 14th Players Championship of the year, 5–6 to Robert Thornton in an all Scottish final. Anderson then won the non-ranking Irish Masters by beating Colin Osborne 6–1 in the final. He finished second in Group F of the Grand Slam of Darts to qualify for the last 16, where he faced Andy Hamilton. Despite averaging almost 102, Anderson lost 9–10 in a thrilling match. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Anderson was 26th on the Order of Merit, inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He saw off Wes Newton and Robert Thornton, but was then beaten 8–10 by Simon Whitlock in the quarter-finals.\nDuring the 2012 season, Anderson, together with the seven other players who competed in the Premier League recorded a charity single with Chas Hodges and his band called 'Got My Tickets for the Darts' which was written by Chas. It was released on 18 May, the night after the play-offs at the O2 in London, where it was premiered. Proceeds from the single were donated to the Haven House Children's Hospice.\n2013.\nAnderson survived three match darts versus John Bowles in the second round of the 2013 World Championship to win in a deciding set, but was then comfortably beaten by Raymond van Barneveld 0–4 in 33 minutes as he missed a total of 23 darts at doubles. Because the ranking system works as a two-year rolling list based on prize money earned, Anderson lost the £100,000 from reaching the 2011 World Championship final and dropped to world number 11 after the tournament. Anderson partnered Robert Thornton for the third time at the World Cup of Darts and they were shocked by Spain 4–5 in the last 16. He threw a nine-dart finish in the third UK Open Qualifier during a first round win over Josh Payne, but lost in the following round 5–6 to Michael van Gerwen.\nHe qualified for the 2013 Premier League by virtue of being the 2011 champion. In the first eight matches he could only beat Phil Taylor and Simon Whitlock and went into the ninth week knowing he had to beat James Wade to have any chance of avoiding being one of the two relegated players from the 10-man league. Anderson lost 3–7 to Wade and stated afterwards that he has struggled with his game for the last year. At the UK Open he led Kevin Painter 7–3 in the fourth round, but then lost six consecutive legs to exit the tournament 7–9. Anderson showed his best darts in the first round of the World Grand Prix as he averaged 104.86 in the double start event during a two sets to nil 10-minute defeat of Jelle Klaasen. He then edged past Wes Newton 3–2 before meeting Phil Taylor in top form in the quarter-finals who beat Anderson 3–0. At the Grand Slam of Darts, Anderson produced two superb performances in the group stage as he averaged 107.14 and 111.80 in defeats of Wesley Harms and Peter Wright. He lost his other game to James Wade to finish second in the group and play Taylor in the last 16. Anderson again posted an impressive average of 106.13 (almost four points ahead of Taylor's), but from 4–4 was unable to capitalise on the chances his scoring set up and lost 10–5. Anderson's second major quarter-final of the year came at the Players Championship Finals where he lost 9–7 to Justin Pipe.\n2014.\nAnderson comfortably beat Mark Dudbridge and Brendan Dolan in the 2014 World Championship to face Michael van Gerwen in the third round. He took advantage of a sluggish start from Van Gerwen to establish a 3–1 lead and also missed two darts to win the set he lost. However, Anderson's usual scoring power deserted him as he lost three sets in a row to exit the tournament. Anderson bemoaned the fact that he had been playing consistently well over the previous months but kept losing games he should win through silly mistakes. He then began the year by claiming his first ranking title in two and a half years at the German Darts Championship. Anderson recovered from 5–3 down to Justin Pipe in the final to win 6–5, surviving six match darts from his opponent in the process and said afterwards his goal for the year was to reclaim his ranking in the top eight. His good start to the year continued as he won the fifth UK Open Qualifier with a 6–2 defeat of Robert Thornton. At the UK Open itself he lost 9–7 to Ian White in the fifth round. Anderson's third title of the year came at the first Players Championship as he averaged 111.47 in beating Andrew Gilding 6–5 in a high quality final. Another tournament victory came a week later at the third event by edging out Phil Taylor 6–5, with Anderson describing afterwards that winning has become a habit again.\nAnderson received a Sky Sports wildcard to participate in the Premier League this year. He had a fantastic second half of the season to win five of his last seven matches, drawing the other two, to finish fourth in the table and qualify for the play-offs. Anderson played Van Gerwen in the semi-finals against whom he lost to 7–5 and beat 7–4 during the league stage. There was never more than a leg between the players throughout the whole match with Van Gerwen throwing for it in the deciding leg. He kicked off with a 171 and Anderson could only reply with 17 and went on to lose 8–7. With doubling so often the weakness in Anderson's game, he managed to hit 43% during the whole season this year, the third highest out of the ten players. In June he won his fifth title of the season at the 11th Players Championship with a 6–2 defeat of Thornton.\nAt the World Matchplay, Anderson beat Jamie Caven 10–8 and Stephen Bunting 13–8 (whilst averaging 104.41) to progress past the second round for the first time in his sixth appearance in the event. In the quarter-finals he outplayed Adrian Lewis in winning 13–8 and was then involved in a high quality match against Phil Taylor in the semi-finals as both players averaged 105 which Anderson just lost 17–15. Anderson stated that the quality of his darts was beginning to scare other players again and his successful week took him back into the world's top 10. In September he averaged 115.62 in thrashing Lewis 6–0 in the semi-finals of the 13th Players Championship and then fought back from 5–3 down in the final against Richie Burnett to take the title 6–5. He also reached the final of the 16th event but lost 6–2 against Brendan Dolan. Anderson's successful season in the floor events concluded at the final Players Championship where he sealed the title by throwing a 10 dart leg to edge Peter Wright 6–5. He finished the season top of the Pro Tour Order of Merit and was therefore the number one seed for the Players Championship Finals, something Anderson said he had worked his heart out all year to achieve. He produced his very highest standard throughout the event beginning with a 6–5 win over Christian Kist with an average of 110.62. In the quarter-finals he beat Taylor for the first time since 2007 in a televised knockout match and then eliminated Vincent van der Voort 11–7 and Lewis 11–6 in the final. It was Anderson's fourth major title and he ended the tournament with an overall average of 104.72.\n2015: World Championship win.\nAnderson seemed to become frustrated with his first round opponent Scott Kirchner's playing style at the 2015 World Championship. Kirchner threw an imaginary dart before every visit to the board and Anderson struggled to a 3–1 win averaging 86.20. A much higher quality match followed against the fast throwing Jelle Klaasen in which Anderson recovered from 3–1 down to win 4–3, taking out a crucial 84 finish on the bull in the fifth set with Klaasen waiting on 89 for the match. Both players averaged over 100 with 20 180s thrown. More comfortable victories followed over Cristo Reyes (averaged 104.54) and the previous year's finalist Peter Wright (averaged 102.12) to set up a semi-final tie with Michael van Gerwen. Just like their meeting in the third round of 2014's event, Van Gerwen recovered from a 3–1 deficit to level at 3–3. However, he would miss four darts to gain a set lead for the first time in the match, with Anderson going on to take it 6–3. He finished with a checkout rate of 50% and averaged over 100 for the fourth game in a row.\nAnderson held an early 3–1 advantage over Phil Taylor in the final, before the 16-time world champion won nine of the next ten legs to move 4–3 ahead. Taylor then missed three darts to take the next set, allowing Anderson to tie the scores at 4–4. In Anderson's first visit to the board at the beginning of the ninth set he hit two treble 20s, but his third dart knocked them out of the bed to score nothing. He lost the leg and became distracted by a member of the audience shouting out to be two legs down, before punishing more missed darts from Taylor to claim the set. Anderson stood one set away from the title when he made it 6–4, but Taylor quickly recovered to send the match into a deciding set. Taylor had three darts to hold his throw in the second leg, but could not find the target as Anderson took the final set without reply to win his first World Championship 7–6. The match broke the record for 180s in a PDC final with 32, beating the 31 thrown during the 2007 final. Anderson's total 180s during the whole tournament of 64 was also a record. The title saw him climb to world number three, his highest position to date. Later in the month he was crowned the PDC Player of the Year, Pro Tour Player of the Year, Fans' Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year at the annual awards dinner.\nRest of season.\nAt the Masters, following wins over Andy Hamilton, 10–2, and James Wade, 10–5, in which Anderson averaged 121 in the first five legs, he lost 11–6 to Raymond van Barneveld in the semi-finals. Anderson began his Premier League campaign with a 7–5 win over Phil Taylor. He was beaten 6–2 in the final of the German Darts Championship by Michael van Gerwen. From 8–4 ahead of Mervyn King in the third round of the UK Open, Anderson missed a total of 13 match darts to be defeated 9–8. In week six of the Premier League, Anderson secured a superb 7–1 win over Adrian Lewis, with a 109 average, and continued his form into that weekend by beating James Wade 6–5 to win the first Players Championship event of the year. On his first competitive return to Scotland as world champion, Anderson overcame Kim Huybrechts 7–5 in week seven of the Premier League. He missed double 12 for a nine darter in the last leg. After a 6–6 draw in week nine with Van Barneveld, with a 108 average, Anderson sat third in the Premier League table, with the first round of fixtures completed, and a total of six wins, one draw and 13 points from his first nine matches. After three defeats in his next five matches, Anderson secured his place in the Premier League play-offs with another 7–5 defeat of Phil Taylor in week 14. He finished the regular Premier League season beating Adrian Lewis 7–3 to finish in third. Anderson recorded nine wins, two draws and 20 points from 16 games. He lost 6–4 to Phil Taylor in the final of the ninth Players Championship.\nAnderson rallied from 7–4 down to Dave Chisnall in the Premier League semi-finals to send the match into a deciding leg in which Chisnall missed three match darts, allowing Anderson to take out a 116 finish to beat him 10–9. Anderson defeated Van Gerwen 11–7 in the final to claim the second Premier League title of his career. He became the second player after Phil Taylor win to the World Championship and Premier League in the same year. Anderson made his World Series of Darts debut at the Dubai Masters, but lost to Phil Taylor at the semi-final stage. Anderson and Peter Wright teamed up at the World Cup of Darts as the number two seeds. After wins over Singapore, Hungary, and Hong Kong, they saw off the Dutch duo of Van Gerwen and Van Barneveld in a doubles match to ensure Scotland would play in their first final in the event. They faced England's Taylor and Lewis and were 2–1 down in the tie, before Anderson beat Taylor 4–1 which meant the winner of Wright against Lewis would claim the title, with Lewis triumphing 4–1. At the World Matchplay, Anderson beat Steve Beaton 10–4 in the first round before a surprise 13–9 second round defeat to Mensur Suljović, which ended his bid for the Triple Crown. Following the completion of the tournament, Anderson became the world number two for the first time in his career. He won his second Players Championship of the year at the final event by seeing off James Wade 6–2.\nIn the final of the European Championship, Anderson held a 10–7 advantage over Van Gerwen, but lost four legs in a row without getting a dart for the title as he was beaten 11–10. He averaged 104.22 against Mark Webster in the second round of the Grand Slam of Darts, but the Welshman took out 71% of his shots at doubles to defeat Anderson 10–6 and he lost in the same stage of the Players Championship Finals 10–4 to Daryl Gurney.\n2016: Second World Championship title.\nIn the defence of his title, Anderson reached the final of the 2016 World Championship without facing any troubles following wins over Andy Boulton, Daryl Gurney, Vincent van der Voort, James Wade and Jelle Klaasen with the loss of just two sets. In the semi-finals, he won 6–0 over Jelle Klaasen with a 107 average and threw a nine-dart finish in the opening set. He played Adrian Lewis in a rematch of the 2011 final and hit a 170 finish in the penultimate leg, before hitting double 12 (the same double which he hit to win his first World Championship) to retain his title with a 7–5 win, a reversal of the scoreline from five years ago. 34 180s were thrown which is a record in a professional match. Anderson became the 11th player to win more than one World Championship and joined Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and Lewis in being the only players to have successfully defended their first world title.\nRest of season.\nAnderson took the fourth UK Open Qualifier with a 6–1 victory over James Wade, but at the main event suffered a huge surprise fourth round loss as amateur Barry Lynn won 9–3. He finished third in the Premier League to qualify for the semi-finals and rallied from 8–4 down against Phil Taylor to trail by one leg, but would be beaten 10–7. Anderson had an exceptional year in the invitational World Series events as he claimed the Dubai Masters, Auckland Darts Masters and Tokyo Darts Masters. He reached the semi-finals of the World Matchplay for the second time, but lost 17–8 to Taylor. Anderson's second Pro Tour title of 2016 was the 12th Players Championship which he won by edging out Terry Jenkins 6–5.\nAnderson's first major final after the World Championship came at the World Grand Prix which he got to without dropping more than one set against Jamie Caven, Kyle Anderson, Kim Huybrechts and Raymond van Barneveld. However, he was powerless to stop Michael van Gerwen from capturing the title with a 5–2 win. Anderson was whitewashed 6–0 by Wade in the first round of the European Championship, averaging just 77.40. In his next event, the World Series of Darts Finals, Anderson wore glasses on stage for the first time. He said after going for an eye test he could not believe he had won two world title without being able to see properly and also explained that he has had to change his throw after his old one would knock his glasses off. He did lose 6–5 to Joe Cullen in his first match wearing them, but reached the semi-finals of the Grand Slam where he was defeated 16–14 by Wade.\n2017.\nIn his quarter-final match with Dave Chisnall at the 2017 World Championship 33 180s were thrown, just one shy of the record. With the match tied at three sets apiece, Chisnall was ahead in the seventh set 2–0, but missed four darts to take it and Anderson would win 5–3. After Peter Wright equalised their semi-final at 3–3 after trailing 3–1, Anderson won nine of the next ten legs to reach the final for the third year in a row with a 6–3 victory.\nHe was on a 17-game unbeaten streak at the event and missed two darts to take a 3–1 lead over Michael van Gerwen in the early stages of the final. Van Gerwen then won 12 of the next 14 legs in taking four sets in a row and, though Anderson pulled one back, his reign as world champion ended with a 7–3 loss. Anderson had not averaged over 100 in his two previous wins in the final, but averaged 104.93 in this defeat, as well as hitting 22 180s which is a record in a single match. The pair smashed the record for the most 180s in a match with 42 and Anderson's 71 for the entire tournament is also a record.\nAnderson and Van Gerwen also met in the final of the Masters, with Anderson losing 11–7. He was level at 7–7 with Van Gerwen in the semi-finals of the Premier League, before being defeated 10–7. Anderson and Wright suffered a surprise first round 5–2 defeat to Singapore at the World Cup.\n2018: World Matchplay and UK Open champion.\nAnderson began his 2018 season with a loss to eventual runner-up Phil Taylor in the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Championship, failing to reach the final for the first time in 4 years.\nWith Rob Cross breaking into the top 3 in Order of Merit with his World Championship victory over Taylor, Anderson would play the 2018 season ranked 4th in the world. This would queue him up for a series of semi-finals matches against Michael van Gerwen, the first of which would be a 5–11 loss in the Masters. Anderson returned 2 weeks later to win the 4th UK Open Qualifier and enter the UK Open as the 6th seed. Having not reached the final since his 2010 loss to Taylor, Anderson reached the final for a second time to defeat Corey Cadby 11–7. Just a week later, Anderson followed up with back to back victories in Players Championships 3 and 4.\nIn the 2018 Premier League, Anderson had an 8–5–3 (W–L–D) record to finish 3rd in the league table and reach the playoffs for the 5th year straight, but would fall to Michael Smith in the semi-final. Nevertheless, Anderson would turn around two days later to win his third Players Championship title of the year. Another two weeks later, Anderson would join Peter Wright for the fourth time to represent Scotland at the 2018 World Cup. With the pair having only lost one set before the finals, they fell to the reigning champions, Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld of The Netherlands with MVG's 4–0 defeat of the Flying Scotsman.\nAnderson kicked off the second half of the year with an 8–4 victory over Rob Cross in the final of the US Darts Masters where he hit the tournament high checkout of 164 in the final leg. The following week, his World Series success would come to an end after a first round defeat in the Shanghai Darts Masters. His form was soon to return in the World Matchplay where he hit a £45,000 nine-dart finish against Joe Cullen in the quarter-finals. With a defeat over Cullen and Jeffrey de Zwaan, who had beaten other two-time world champions Michael van Gerwen and Adrian Lewis in the first two rounds, Anderson met Mensur Suljović in the final. In the longest match in Matchplay history, Anderson defeated Suljović 21–19 in the best of 35 match with the stipulation that the game must be won by 2 clear legs. The tournament saw Anderson hit 52 180s, the most ever in a winning effort at the Matchplay, and second overall only to the 56 that Adrian Lewis hit in his 2013 campaign that ended in defeat by Phil Taylor.\nAfter taking second in his group with victories over Michael van Gerwen and Dave Chisnall, but a loss to Daryl Gurney, Anderson would meet Suljović again in the semi-final of the 2018 Champions League of Darts. The Scotsman secured an 11–4 victory over the Austrian to avenge his defeat in the 2017 Final where the Austrian won 11–9. Anderson was quick to follow up with another 11–4 victory in the final against his fellow countryman Peter Wright to become the third champion in as many stagings of the tournament. A week later in the World Grand Prix, Anderson would again struggle when he fell to the reigning champion Daryl Gurney for the second time in two weeks, with a 3–0 defeat in the quarter-finals.\nIn November, Anderson went undefeated in the group stage of the Grand Slam and met MVG in the semi-final having only lost 12 legs combined in the prior rounds. Anderson took the set 16–12 before meeting Gerwyn Price in the final. After at one point leading the match 11–8, Anderson was visibly distracted by Price, and only won 2 of the next 10 legs, to lose 13–16 in the controversial final. The following week in the 2018 Players Championship Finals, Anderson once again met MVG in the semi-finals with each of them having only given up 9 legs in the tournament so far. This time around, Van Gerwen would get the advantage, winning 11–9 before losing to Daryl Gurney by the same margin in the final.\n2019: World Cup win.\nAnderson entered the 2019 World Championship as the fourth seed and won his opening match against Kevin Burness 3–1. He led his third round match against Jermaine Wattimena 3–1, before losing the next two sets, then had to survive match darts to take the game to a tie break before eventually prevailing 5–3 in the deciding set. In the fourth round, Anderson recovered from a 2–0 deficit to Chris Dobey to win the final set in another tiebreaker with a score of 4–2 legs. In the quarter finals, Anderson appeared to have gotten his game back with a 5–2 victory over Dave Chisnall and a 103.03 average, his first over 100 in the tournament. Anderson visibly struggled however in his semi-final match with Michael van Gerwen. The world number one put up a 104.76 average to Anderson's 97.98 to secure a 6–1 victory and only giving up 7 legs.\nAnderson had been struggling with back problems for a couple of years at this point, and took the decision to withdraw from the Masters at the start of February 2019 due to these issues. He then had to take the decision to also pull out of the Premier League, meaning that he'd miss the tournament for the first time since 2010. However, Anderson stated that a specialist had found the problem with his back and that he hoped to be back in action within a couple of months after receiving treatment. On 25 February, it was announced that Anderson would make his yearly debut at the 2019 UK Open in March.\nAnderson, alongside teammate Peter Wright, won the 2019 PDC World Cup of Darts, the first time Scotland had won the tournament.\n2020.\nAnderson exited the 2020 World Championship in the fourth round, losing to Nathan Aspinall. He returned to the Premier League after a year away.\nAnderson won his first ranking title since the 2018 Matchplay at the first Players Championship event of 2020; beating Jeff Smith in the final. At the 2020 World Matchplay, Anderson made his first televised singles final since 2018, losing to Dimitri Van den Bergh.\n2021: Fifth world final.\nAnderson went into the 2021 World Championship as thirteenth seed; and dismissed his chances of a third world title after an opening win over Madars Razma, describing 2019 &amp; 2020 as \"rotten\". He beat Mensur Suljović 4–3 in a controversial game, with Anderson accusing his opponent of gamesmanship. Anderson then whitewashed Devon Petersen to reach the eighth PDC World Championship quarterfinal of his career. Dirk van Duijvenbode won the first set against Anderson in the quarter-finals, but Anderson turned the game around including a run of ten legs in a row to win the match 5–1. Anderson secured a 6–3 win over Dave Chisnall in the semi-finals to qualify for his fifth World Championship final and set up a repeat of the controversial 2018 Grand Slam of Darts final against Gerwyn Price. Anderson went on to lose the final 7–3 to Price.\nAt the World Matchplay he lost in the second round to Nathan Aspinall.\n2022.\nAnderson reached the semi-finals of the 2022 World Championship before losing 6–4 to eventual champion Peter Wright.\n2023: World Cup runner up.\nAt the 2023 World Championship, Anderson lost 4–1 in the third round to Chris Dobey.\nIn June he reached the final of the World Cup with Scotland before losing to Wales.\n2024.\nAnderson opened his 2024 World Championship campaign with a 3–0 win over Simon Whitlock. He then took out Croatia's Boris Krčmar but then lost to Brendan Dolan.\nAnderson won the second Players Championship event on the Professional Darts Corporation's Pro Tour in 2024, defeating Ryan Searle 8–5 with an average of 117.12 in the final.

Anderson defeated 6–3 in legs, then Gerwyn Price 6–4, Josh Rock 6–5 in a deciding leg and Rob Cross 7–5 to reach the final. In the final Anderson triumphed over Ross Smith 8–6.\nPersonal life.\nOriginally from Musselburgh, East Lothian, Anderson moved to Eyemouth, Berwickshire, after meeting his ex-wife Rosemary. The couple have two children.\nHaving previously worked as a builder, Anderson and his partner Rachel moved south to run the Wellington Arms public house in Rooksbridge, Somerset, for fellow PDC player Steve Grubb. The couple have a son Tai (born 2014), and in October 2017 welcomed a baby girl. Regulars at the Wellington Arms included former world champions, Trina Gulliver and Mark Webster.

        "title": "George Martin (American football)",
        "text": "George Dwight Martin (born February 16, 1953) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire career as a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants (1975–1988).\nCareer.\nMartin missed only six games in his 14-year playing career (not counting games not played in because of strikes). He played college football at the University of Oregon in the then-Pacific-8 Conference and was drafted by the Giants in the 11th round of the 1975 NFL Draft (262nd pick overall). He was a part of the 1986 Giants team that won a franchise record 14 games. In January 1987, Martin was one of the team captains for the Super Bowl XXI champions; late in the second quarter, Martin sacked Denver QB John Elway in the end zone for a safety, cutting the Broncos' lead to 10-9 where it held until halftime. They were the first two of twenty-six consecutive points scored by the Giants in the game.\nIn November 1985, Martin became the NFL's all-time leader in touchdowns scored by a defensive lineman (DL), with 5, when he returned an interception for 56 yards against the St. Louis Cardinals. (He had previously been tied at 4 with former Dallas Cowboy defensive tackle Bob Lilly.) In the following championship season, Martin became the league's career leader in TDs scored by a DL as a DL (at 6) when he returned an interception for 78 yards and 6 points in an late season home game against the same Broncos team they defeated in the Super Bowl, a feat which Giant head coach Bill Parcells has called the \"greatest football play I've ever seen.\"\nMartin's 7 NFL TDs came on 3 interception returns, 2 fumble returns/recoveries, one lateral return following a blocked field goal, and one offensive pass reception (in 1980, lining up as a tight end). (In November 2006, Miami's All-Pro defensive end Jason Taylor broke Martin's career record by notching his 7th defensive touchdown after intercepting a Brad Johnson pass.)\nIn addition, Martin amassed over 90 quarterback sacks in his Giants career (his official NFL total is 46 [the NFL did not begin counting sacks officially until 1982]; the Giants credit him with 96), during which time he was generally regarded as one of the league's most feared pass rushers. In 2004, he was inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey.\nMartin has been a resident of Ringwood, New Jersey.\nJourney for 9/11.\nOn September 16, 2007, Martin began walking from New York City's George Washington Bridge to San Diego in order to raise money for medical care for the first responders to the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States. Costing $150,000, Martin hoped to raise more than $10 million for this cause. World Wrestling Entertainment, among others, sponsored Martin's walk.\nMartin planned to walk more than 3,000 miles across the nation, from the New York side of the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey, down to Washington, D.C., south to Interstate 40, then west, eventually leading to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. He hoped to finish his walk by March 2008.\nMartin arrived in San Diego on June 21, 2008 after having walked over 3,000 miles. He said the total amount raised was about $2 million."

        "text": "The World Darts Federation (WDF) is a sport governing body and (along with the PDC) a tournament organiser for the game of darts. It was formed in 1974 by representatives of the original fourteen founding members. Membership is open to the national organising body for darts in all nations. The WDF encourages the promotion of the sport of darts among and between those bodies, in an effort to gain international recognition for darts as a major sport. The WDF is a full member of Global Association of International Sports Federations, which is the governing body for international sports federations.\nThe WDF stages a world championship (called the WDF World Cup), as well as continental championships such as the WDF Americas Cup, the WDF Asia-Pacific Cup and the WDF Europe Cup. The country that is first in the overall leader board (overall best result in the two events, singles, pairs, teams) becomes the world champion. Winners of any of the events can also call themselves the official World Champion. Winners of continental championships can call themselves the official champion of their own areas.\nAfter the collapse of the British Darts Organisation in September 2020, the WDF announced plans to launch the WDF World Championship and WDF World Masters. Both competitions took place for the first time in 2022, starting with the 2022 WDF World Darts Championship in April.\nMembers.\n76 national full members plus 3 interim nembers(Mauritania, Yemen, Papua New Guinea) :\nThe WDF Rankings, as defined by the World Darts Federation, are the \"objective merit-based method used for determining qualification for entry and seeding in all of its tournaments for both male and female singles, pairs and team\". The rankings tables are \"rolling tables\", and points from an event are counted until that event occurs the following year. If a particular event does not occur in the following year, points are deleted after a calendar year.\nTournament levels and points allocation.\nA player's WDF Ranking is based on the points they have accrued from their best 10 performances over the previous 12 month rolling period. \nThe eligible tournaments include a selection of Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze level tournaments with decreasing points at each level.\nSince the formation of the WDF rankings in 1974 the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.\nNotes: The WDF international tournaments have six categories for both men and women (singles, pairs and teams)\nCurrent points distribution.\n\"Points are currently awarded as follows:\"\nCurrent WDF World Rankings.\nThe rankings are based on a cumulative points system similar to ATP rankings in tennis they are done on a rolling one year basis. When a tournament is played, the previous year's results are removed from the rankings. This list is used to determine seeds for some of the WDF Opens. The World Darts Federation also have a ranking system designed to provide a measure of the global activities of darts players in every WDF recognised darts event. It used to be very similar to the BDO system but was revised in January 2007 to include categories by country and by events, and the distribution of ranking points reflect the levels of prize money on offer and the numbers of entries in a tournament. Therefore, the WDF World Rankings give a better reflection on BDO player world ranking. The leading players gain points in different levels of categorised events and prize money and at the end of the season the leading players receive monetary bonus rewards from the WDF.\nWDF World No1 men's and women's players (1976–current).\nThe rankings show Deta Hedman and Trina Gulliver as consistently being the leading women's player's, having been number one on a record ten or more occasions each. No male player has held the number one position as many years Gulliver and Hedman, although Eric Bristow has held the top position for a record six times. The rankings for the men has become even more complex since the inception of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) formerly the World Darts Council (WDC). The leading ranked players in 1993/94 split from the BDO and they have their own world ranking system known as the Order of Merit. The players from the PDC are not included in the rankings because the BDO, which is the British governing body of amateur darts, is the one that is recognised by the WDF."

He was later traded to the Edmonton Oilers on March 9, 2004, in exchange for struggling goaltender Tommy Salo and a sixth-round draft pick in 2005.\nGilbert played junior hockey with the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He made his debut at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with the Badgers in 2002. In the 2005–06 season, he ranked third on the team in points, and also scored the winning goal in the 2006 NCAA Championship game against Boston College.\nGilbert made his professional debut in the 2006–07 season with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL). Through 33 games, he was tied for the team lead in points among defensemen.\nDue to injuries, Gilbert was called-up to the NHL in January 2007 and made his NHL debut on his 24th birthday against the San Jose Sharks. He scored his first NHL goal on February 20, 2007, against the Ottawa Senators' Martin Gerber in the final seconds of the game to send it to overtime.\nOn March 4, 2008, Gilbert surpassed Paul Coffey and Marc-André Bergeron for the Oilers' franchise record for most goals scored by a rookie defenseman in a season with his tenth, which came on the power play against Dan Ellis of the Nashville Predators. On April 11, 2008, Gilbert signed a six-year, $24 million contract extension with the Oilers.\nAt the NHL trade deadline of the 2011–12 season, on February 27, 2012, Gilbert was traded to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for defenseman Nick Schultz. Gilbert finished the season contributing five assists in 20 games.\nAfter the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, with the Wild experiencing cap constraints, Gilbert was used as compliance buyout of the remaining two-year of his contract, to be released as a free agent on July 3, 2013.\nIn September 2013, Gilbert attended the Florida Panthers' pre-season training camp as a free agent, later signing a one-year deal with the club on September 28.

On February 15, 2017, he was traded two weeks before the trade deadline to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a conditional 5th round draft pick (condition not met, pick not transferred). He played out the season with the Capitals AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears.\nAs a free agent, Gilbert left North America after 10 seasons in agreeing to a one-year deal with German outfit, the Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers of the DEL, on July 21, 2017. He signed an extension with the team on July 3, 2018."

In 2007 the UTS-Balmain club formed a partnership with the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust and are now known as Sydney CC or Sydney Cricket Club or just simply Sydney Tigers. The Tigers play out of Drummoyne Oval. With over 100 years of history and tradition, Balmain have long been a mainstay of the competition. In season 2007/08 there were 14 different sides representing the black and gold, eight of these men's and six women's. After the merger with the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, the club is often seen as the competition's glamour club.\nHistory of Balmain.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, a club by the name of Sydney Cricket Club was in existence and playing regular fixtures. Based at Moore Park, players included Jack Marsh.\nFrom 1897–1900, a team known as the Balmain Electorate Cricket Club was included in the Sydney grade cricket competition. They joined teams known as East Sydney, Paddington, Waverley, Glebe, South Sydney, Burwood, North Sydney, Redfern, Central Cumberland and Leichhardt.\nBetween 1900 and 1904, the team was renamed the Leichhardt-Balmain District Cricket Club and from 1904 it became known as the Balmain District Club. In 2001–2002, the Club entered into a partnership with the University of Technology, Sydney and was then known as UTS Balmain Cricket Club. In over 100 years of competition, the Club has won 7 Club Championships, 4 first grade premierships and a number of lower grade premierships but the history of cricket is liberally sprinkled with players from Balmain who represented their State and Country with distinction.\nThroughout the period from 1897 to 1946–47, Birchgrove Oval was the headquarters of the club and it was 1947–48 when the club moved to Drummoyne Oval. The most famous game ever played by Balmain was undoubtedly the one at Birchgrove on 18 and 25 March 1933 when around 10,000 people attended each day to watch St George with Don Bradman and Balmain with Arthur Mailey. For the record, the match ended in a draw – Balmain 394 – St George 7/358 (Bradman 134).\nProbably the most famous Balmain players are Archie Jackson and Arthur Mailey, but the list of international and state players who played with Balmain at one time or another is star studded. They hold claim to finding Tasmanian Tigers sensation Brendan Drew and were once the home of Graham Thorpe, Nathan Bracken, Joe Denly, Zak Crawley and Ireland 2007 World Cup hero Jeremy Bray. The highest first grade run scorer of all time is, however, former opening batsman Greg Hayne, who retired at the end of the 2006/07 season, who also heads the list of those who have scored the most centuries for the club.\nFollowing the decision to merge with the SCG Trust the club has experienced a significant financial windfall, allowing them to assemble one of the better squads in the competition, including the purchase of recently de-listed players Dominic Thornley and Daniel Smith and English representatives Joe Denly and Sam Northeast. Due to this, they were successful in the First Grade Twenty20 competition in 2010/11, but were unable to make a significant challenge for the First Grade premiership."

        "title": "Five-second rule (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, the five-second rule, or five-second violation, is a rule that helps promote continuous play. There are multiple situations where a five-second violation may occur.\nFive-second throw-in violation.\nUnder all basketball rule sets, a team attempting to throw a ball in-bounds has five seconds to release the ball towards the court. The five second clock starts when the team throwing it in has possession of the ball (usually bounced or handed to a player while out of bounds by the official).\nPenalty.\nLoss of ball. Possession will be awarded to the opponent at the previous out of bounds spot.\nFive-second closely guarded violation.\nA five-second closely guarded violation may be called against an offensive player with the ball when that player is guarded closely for five seconds or more, and does not pass, shoot, or dribble within that time.\nUnder NCAA men's rules, to be considered \"closely guarded\", a defender must be guarding a player who is located in the frontcourt and within six feet of the player. The count applies to a player who is only holding the ball. Prior to the 2015–16 season, the rule included those dribbling the ball as well. This allows for multiple closely guarded counts to occur. NCAA women's rules require the defender to be within three feet and can occur anywhere on the playing court, but only applies when the offensive player is holding the ball. A count ends whenever the player with the ball gets his head and shoulders past the defender, the defender is no longer within the required distance, the same defender does not continuously closely guard the player in control of the ball, or another opponent is between the defender and the ball.\nHigh school rules mimic men's college basketball's closely guarded rule. A defender must be guarding the player in control of the ball, in the frontcourt, and must be within six feet of the player. A player may be holding or dribbling the ball. If defensive teammates switch, and both are within six feet of the player in control of the ball, the same count is continued.\nUnder FIBA rules, a defender must be within one meter of a player holding the ball and must be in an active guarding position. This count can occur anywhere on the playing court.\nIn the NBA this rule is applied only in a throw in scenario.\nA five-second count will begin if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded or starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. (The five-second count commences when the offensive player penetrates the free throw line extended.) After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession.\nPenalty.\nThe penalty for a five-second closely guarded violation is loss of ball. The opposing team will throw-in the ball from the out-of-bounds spot nearest the violation.\nFive-second back to the basket violation.\nIn the NBA, a player in the frontcourt, below the free throw line extended, is not permitted to dribble the ball with his back or side to the basket for more than five seconds. A count ends when:\nPenalty.\nLoss of ball. The opponent is awarded the ball at the free throw line extended.\nFive-second free throw violation.\nA free throw shooter, under FIBA rules, must shoot the ball towards the hoop within five seconds after an official places it at the shooters disposal. (Under North American rule sets, the shooter is allowed 10 seconds.)\nPenalty.\nIf the free throw is successful, then the point shall not count. The ball is awarded to the opponent at the free throw line extended unless another free throw is to follow or a possession penalty is to follow."

        "title": "Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Sailing/Yachting is an Olympic sport starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule. The sailing program of 1976 consisted of six sailing classes (disciplines). For each class, seven races were scheduled from 19 July 1976 to 27 July 1976 off the coast of Kingston, Ontario, on Lake Ontario. The sailing was done on the triangular-type Olympic courses.\nVenue.\nAccording to the IOC statutes the contests in all sport disciplines must be held either in, or as close as possible to the city which the IOC has chosen. Since Montréal was not a suitable place the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour Kingston, Ontario, constructed in 1969, was reconstructed in 1974 in time for the 1976 Olympic Sailing event.\nA total of three race areas were created on Lake Ontario.\nThe distance from the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour to course area Bravo (red) was about From there it was another to the course area's Alpha (yellow) and Charlie (blue). This however ensured wind conditions without local effects.\nRemarks.\nFacilities.\nAt the Portsmouth area a new Olympic facility was constructed. This building was built to contain all facilities needed during that period. It holds, for instance, a large measurement hall and several exercise rooms. Only the size of the overhead doors of the measurement hall was not wide enough to bring a fully assembled Tornado in. Each had to be lifted on one side to enter diagonally.\nSailing.\nAfter the races in the Tempest an unprecedented incident occurred:\nAlan Warren and David Hunt set their Tempest on fire. With this boat they won the silver medal in 1972 though during the transport to Canada the boat called \"Gift 'orse\" was damaged. Warren and Hunt ended in Kingston in 14th position. After the incident Warren stated: \"The Horse was lame and we had to put her down.\"\nThe story did not end there as Canada Customs could not accept the boat was not available for them to inspect.\nSailors.\nDuring the sailing regattas at the 1972 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:"

        "title": "2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 73rd playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues that make up Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 9, 2002 at Miller Park, now named American Family Field, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the home of the Milwaukee Brewers of the NL. The game controversially ended with a 7–7 tie due to both teams running out of available pitchers. Beginning the next year, home field advantage in the World Series would be awarded to the winning league to prevent ties (this rule would stay until 2017).\nNo player was awarded the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award due to the game ending in a tie. The roster selection for the 2002 game marked the inaugural All-Star Final Vote competition (then known as \"The All-Star 30th Man\" competition). Johnny Damon and Andruw Jones represented the American and National Leagues as a result of this contest.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nNational League.\nNotes\nGame.\nGame summary.\nNational League starting pitcher Curt Schilling was sharp early on, striking out three through two innings pitched. In the bottom of the first, Barry Bonds hit a deep fly ball off AL starter Derek Lowe, which looked to be deep enough to be a home run. Instead, center fielder Torii Hunter reached over the wall and caught Bonds' drive, denying the NL an early lead. Bonds playfully picked up Hunter as the NL took the field the next inning.\nThe NL got on the board in the bottom of the second inning, when a Mike Piazza groundout scored Vladimir Guerrero from third base. The NL scored three more runs in the next inning, when Todd Helton singled home Jimmy Rollins. Barry Bonds got revenge for having his first-inning home run taken away, belting a two-run hit to give the NL a 4–0 lead. The AL finally scored in the fourth, on the strength of a Manny Ramírez RBI single.\nThe AL cut the NL lead in half in the fifth, when Alfonso Soriano hit a homer off Éric Gagné to cut the lead to 4–2. The NL got a run back with Damian Miller's RBI double to put the NL up 5–2. The AL put together a high-scoring inning in the seventh to take the lead. An RBI groundout from Garret Anderson, an RBI single from Tony Batista, and a two-run double from Paul Konerko scored four runs for the AL, giving them a 6–5 lead after their half of the seventh.\nThe NL regained the lead in the bottom of the seventh, with a two-run single from Lance Berkman, allowing Mike Lowell and Damian Miller to score. The AL quickly tied the score in the eighth, with Omar Vizquel's RBI triple. Neither team scored in the ninth and the game went into extra innings. Vicente Padilla and Freddy García each pitched scoreless tenth innings, keeping the game tied.\nA serious problem arose at this point, as Padilla and Garcia were the last available pitchers on each team. After a scoreless top of the 11th inning, AL and NL managers Joe Torre and Bob Brenly met by the first base dugout with Commissioner Bud Selig to discuss the situation.\nSelig controversially ruled that if the NL did not score in the bottom of the 11th, the game would be declared a tie. After the decision was announced over the stadium's public address system, fans loudly booed and jeered, with beer bottles being thrown onto the field, and chants of \"Let them play!\", \"Refund!\", \"Bud must go!\" and \"Ripoff!\" were heard. Garcia retired the NL side in the 11th, and the game ended in a 7–7 tie, to further booing and bottle throwing. No MVP award was given.\nHome Run Derby.\nThe Home Run Derby took place on July 8 with eight players, four from each league, competing to try to hit as many home runs as possible."

        "text": "Frank Douglas Lewis (born July 4, 1947) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 13 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Buffalo Bills in the National Football League (NFL).\nLewis played college football for the Grambling State Tigers and received third-team honors on the 1970 Little All-America college football team.\nHe was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 1971 NFL Draft. He won two Super Bowl rings with the team, in Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl X.\nIn August 1978 the Steelers traded Lewis to the Bills in exchange for tight end Paul Seymour. Seymour was returned by the Steelers when he failed to pass their physical. Lewis, however, remained with the Bills and the Steelers ended up receiving no compensation in the trade.\nLewis was a Pro Bowl selection in 1981 as a member of the Bills. In his pro career, he caught 397 receptions for 6,724 yards and 40 touchdowns.\nIn 2019, Lewis was elected to the 10th class of the Black College Football Hall of Fame. As a star player at Grambling State in the Southwestern Athletic Conference, he helped the university win the conference championship in 1968. He scored 42 total touchdowns, both receiving and rushing, during his four years there before becoming a first-round draft pick."

        "title": "Andre Brown (basketball)",
        "text": "Andre Devon Brown (born May 12, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for DePaul University and went on to play professionally in Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, and in the National Basketball Association and the NBA Development League. He is also a former two-year member of the USA Basketball World Youth Games team that won a gold medal 1998 and a bronze medal in 1999.\nHigh school career.\nAs a high school freshman, Brown attended Brother Rice High School in his hometown of Chicago. As a sophomore, he transferred to nearby Leo Catholic High School where he led his new team downstate and along the way, captured Class A All-State honors, being the only sophomore on the ballot. The following year Leo moved up in population and therefore changed classes to the larger Class AA. In Class AA, Brown continued his dominating ways, garnering All-State honors again, this time initiating the record as the only player to ever be both Class A and AA All-State. Things were changed up again for his senior year in 1999–2000 as Leo were moved back down to Class A, as Brown went on to help Leo win the Catholic League title and earn McDonald's All-American honors.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman season at DePaul, Brown joined Imari Sawyer as the first DePaul newcomers since 1992 to have a double-double in their first collegiate game, as he recorded 18 points and 11 rebounds against Lewis University. He scored a season-high 19 points while also grabbing eight rebounds against Marquette. In 30 games (six starts), he averaged 6.5 points and 4.9 rebounds in 22.6 minutes per game.\nIn his sophomore season, Brown became the first DePaul player since Stanley Brundy in 1988–89 to lead the team in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots. He also ranked among Conference USA leaders for rebounding (second), scoring (13th) and field goal percentage (14th). He set a C-USA single game record with 27 rebounds against TCU, which was the second-best single-game total in DePaul history. In 26 games (25 starts), he averaged 14.5 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 31.8 minutes per game.\nIn his junior season, Brown was selected to the Preseason All-Conference USA team by the league coaches, and went on to record multiple double-doubles in 2002–03, none better than a game-high 20 points and 11 rebounds against UNLV. In 28 games (18 starts), he averaged 9.4 points and 9.0 rebounds in 30.5 minutes per game.\nIn his senior season, Brown earned second-team All-Conference USA honors after he was first selected to the Conference USA All-Preseason team and during the season, he was twice named C-USA Player of the Week. He was also named to the All-Tournament team at the Spartan Coca-Cola Classic. In 23 games (all starts), he averaged 13.5 points and 9.2 rebounds in 32.2 minutes per game.\nBrown finished his four-year career ranked fourth in Conference USA history with 855 rebounds and became one of only eight players in DePaul history to have 1,000 points and 800 rebounds in a career. He went on to be named to the All-Tournament Team at the 2004 Portsmouth Invitational Tournament after averaging 18.3 points (4th in tourney) and 10.7 rebounds (2nd in tourney).\nProfessional career.\n2004–05 season.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2004 NBA draft, Brown joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2004 NBA Summer League.

The following month, he signed with Sedima Roseto of Italy for the 2004–05 season. In February 2005, he left Roseto and signed with Budućnost Podgorica of Montenegro for the rest of the season. In April 2005, he joined the Barangay Ginebra Kings of the Philippines where he played seven games for the club before leaving in late May.\n2005–06 season.\nIn July 2005, Brown joined the Seattle SuperSonics for the 2005 NBA Summer League. In October 2005, he signed with the Daegu Orions of South Korea for the 2005–06 season. In February 2006, he was traded to the Incheon ET Land Black Slamer.\n2006–07 season.\nIn July 2006, Brown joined the San Antonio Spurs for the 2006 NBA Summer League. On September 29, 2006, he signed with the Atlanta Hawks. However, he was later waived by the Hawks on October 26, 2006. On November 2, 2006, he was selected by the Sioux Falls Skyforce with the second overall pick in the 2006 NBA Development League Draft. He went on to earn D-League Player of the Week honors on December 18 after recording three straight double-doubles over the week as he led the Skyforce to a 3–0 record. In 16 games for Sioux Falls, he averaged 22.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game.\nOn January 5, 2007, Brown signed a 10-day contract with the Seattle SuperSonics, going on to sign a second 10-day contract on February 15, and for the rest of the season on January 25.\n2007–08 season.\nDespite joining the Indiana Pacers but not playing for them during the 2007 NBA Summer League, Brown signed with the Memphis Grizzlies on July 20, 2007. Despite a promising stint with the SuperSonics, Brown managed just 33 games for Memphis in 2007–08 as he averaged 3.0 points and 2.8 rebounds in 8.7 minutes per game.

On January 6, 2011, he was released by Panellinios after appearing in six league games and three EuroCup games.\nOn January 13, 2011, Brown signed with the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League as a short-term injury replacement for Matthew Knight. However, after losing co-captain Shawn Redhage to a season-ending hip injury on January 23, Brown's contract was extended by the Wildcats to see out the 2010–11 season. The Wildcats went on to finish fourth on the ladder and played the New Zealand Breakers in the semi-finals, where they lost 2 games to 1.

        "title": "Cricket dolls",
        "text": "Cricket is a talking doll that was first unveiled in February 1986 at the American International Toy Fair in New York. It was the first major product sold by Playmates Toys, a Hong Kong-based company that until that time had mostly imported toys from overseas and distributed them for the U.S. market.\nCricket was designed by Larry Jones at California R&amp;D Center. Similar talking animal toys such as Worlds of Wonder's Teddy Ruxpin and Mother Goose had previously been released but Playmates' concept was to create a humanistic doll that simulated speech capability. The scripts and songs were written by Robin Frederick and Jay Tverdak. Cricket's catchphrases, including \"Are we having fun or what?\" and \"I'll be talkin' to ya!\" were written by Jones. Cricket was voiced by nine-year-old Laura Mooney.\nThe Cricket dolls operated in similar fashion to that of Teddy Ruxpin, but had two-sided cassette tapes with sound and movement data on separate tracks rather than on separate sides of the tape. The doll required four \"C\" batteries for the player and one nine-volt battery for the mouth movement. As Cricket's mouth moved, her eyes also looked around in different directions.\nCricket was available in models with black and white skin colors. The black Cricket doll was released with two different hairstyles, one with hair identical to that of the white version with two curly pigtails tied with pink yarn and the other version had short curly hair with no ribbons.\nCricket was sold wearing a pink sweater, yellow underpants, pleated mint green skirt, yellow socks and pink high-top sneakers with monogrammed laces. Her sweater came in two variations, one knitted and the other velour and has a small logo of a cricket on the right side of both sweaters. Cricket also came with her \"health plan\" and two tapes, one labeled \"Operating &amp; Caring for Cricket\" and the other, which was unlabeled, featured songs, jokes and stories.\nThe Cricket line was discontinued before all of the planned products could be released. These included the book and tape set “Cricket Visits Australia” and a planned device named the “Chatterbox” which would enable Cricket and Corky to interact in much the same manner as the Grubby accessory for Teddy Ruxpin. Despite this, the products continued to be included in lists and advertised in pamphlets packaged with the doll.\nBook and tape sets.\nCricket Books were all hardcover and featured interesting facts and instructions for various crafts and activities.\nOutfit and tape sets.\nThese sets included a tape with games, jokes and stories and a coordinated outfit with accessories.\nCorky.\nCricket had a younger brother named Corky which was released in 1987 and voiced by nine-year-old Edan Gross. Corky was available in both black and white-skinned models. Tapes that were produced for Corky either came with an appropriate outfit or a workbook which included activities related to math or reading.\nJill.\nCricket also had an older sister named Jill (voice actress currently unknown), released in 1987. Jill's catchphrase was \"I'm a lot like you.\" Jill operated in much the same way as Cricket and Corky, as she could move her mouth and her eyes left and right. However, Jill could also move her arms, head, and blink as well. She used specially made cartridges with a four-track tape, containing three audio tracks and one data track. Jill also had voice-recognition capabilities. She could ask questions at certain parts of the tape, which could be responded to by either saying \"yes\" or \"no\" or choosing one of three answers, to which Jill would then play the correct audio track until the segment was over. If no voice was heard, Jill would choose a reply at random.\nJill was available in both black and white-skinned models, each with the same hairstyle with curly bangs and a curly ponytail tied in a bow with one pink and one blue ribbon. Jill was sold wearing a pink, purple and blue striped sweater, blue leggings, pink socks and pink saddle shoes with a purple toe and blue heel. Her sweater also had her butterfly logo embroidered in blue on the left side.\nIn 1989 an inanimate version of Jill with no speech capability was produced under the Precious Playmates line. This version only had a white-skinned model which came in both blonde and brunette hair variants. Extra cartridges could be bought separately in sets; the sets included a cartridge, an outfit and various related accessories. The inanimate version was sold with various outfits of Jill's but did not include cartridges or accessories and only came with her default shoes no matter which outfit was included.\nThe following outfit packs were produced:\nOther merchandise.\nIn addition to the collection of Cricket books, outfits and tapes, Playmates produced coloring books, paper dolls, and home videos.\nIn 1987, two direct-to-video specials were produced by Nelvana and released by Hi-Tops Video on videocassette using audio from already released audiocassettes including “Cricket's Clubhouse” and “Around the World with Cricket.” Also in 1987 five coloring books were published by Happy House, a subsidiary of Random House, and illustrated by Pam Posey and Kathy Allert including “Cricket’s Clubhouse”, “Cricket’s First Day of School”, “Cricket’s Round the World Tour”, “Cricket’s Busy Day” and “Cricket’s Trace 'n' Rub”. In 1988, Random House published the illustrated story book “Cricket and the Birthday Ring” written by Emily James."

        "text": "United Rugby is a Canadian rugby union club that is based in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, representing the cities of Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, and New Westminster. It was formed in 2005 with the joining of the Pocomo RFC and the Douglas College RFC.\nUnited Rugby fields men's teams in Divisions 1 and 2, and Under 23 teams.\na Women's team is fielded in Division 1, and they are the current reigning Champions for the 2016/2017 season.\nUnited Rugby is also host to a mini-rugby program consisting of players age 3-11, and a Junior program for players age 12-17.\nFacilities.\nHome Venues\nClubhouse - 921 Sherwood Avenue, Coquitlam, B.C.\nPocomo History.\nOver forty years ago a group of enthusiasts led by Gordon Eddy and Jack Cole met at the Port Arms Hotel and decided to establish a rugby club outside of the traditional Vancouver area. The idea was to foster the development of the game in the Port Moody, Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam; thus the creation of the Pocomo Rugby Club.\nVic Coulter (1917–2001) was chosen to be the first President and the Club has experienced a relatively health existence ever since its 1963 inception. Although the Club has never had access to significant finances, industrious members have done what was necessary to persevere.\nUnder the Direction of Coulter the Club continued to grow and set as a goal the dissemination of the gospel of rugby throughout the Fraser Valley. In order to do this the Club contacted all the Secondary Schools form Port Moody to Chilliwack and team members organized clinics in order to get recent graduates interested in club rugby. The Club established the annual Outriders Trophy with Richmond Rugby Club, who at the time was the only other club beyond Vancouver city.\nAll the hard work proved to be successful and in 1973 Coulter and Pocomo helped organize the Fraser Valley Rugby Union. The Fraser Valley Rugby Union launched with thirteen clubs, which included no less than five from the U.S. A few fledgling clubs such as Port Coquitlam, Pitt River, Maple Ridge and the U.S. sides have come and gone, only to occasionally resurface. Pocomo continued to grow as one of the pillars of the Fraser Valley and by 1983 they would field four senior men's teams. The Club has won numerous league championships as well as various members were given the Vic Coulter Service Award, for their contribution to rugby in the Fraser Valley.\nIn 1985, Pocomo introduced their first Women's side and defeated S.F.U., who hadn't lost a match in three years. This first Women's program didn't last long and by 1988 the program was temporarily shut down. Sticking with their roots, Pocomo has continued to foster rugby in the high schools of the Tri-Cities for both boys and girls. Club members volunteer in both middle school and high school as coaches, referees and managers. The Club has also donated a trophy and organized an annual tournament for the top senior team in the Tri-Cities. This hard work has continued to prove successful and in 2000 Pocomo restarted a Women's side who earned the 2nd division provincial championship. With this success, the women's side moved up into the 1st division league, in 2005 they added a second women's team and won the 1st division Provincial Cup and the opportunity for promotion into the BC Provincial Premier League.\nThe Club heralds a strong tradition of players and alumni who are hard, dedicated workers. Club honours began when Bill Christie received the Stroess Trophy in 1966, since then members such as Gordon Eddy, Bill Turpin, Ken Yates and Ian (Onion) Robertson have gone on to win this award. The 2nd division earned the player's first honours winning Dunbar Trophy in 1968.\nWith the introduction of the Premier league in 1997, Pocomo and several other clubs faced new strains and challenges. Pocomo saw over 20 players retire or defect to Premier clubs, this forced the club to be reduced to two senior men's teams. However, they still fought hard and in 1999, Pocomo returned to the Vancouver Rugby Union where it made it to the 2nd division finals. The continued growth in Premier clubs and premier rugby forced Pocomo to make some difficult decisions and in 1998 Pocomo entered into amalgamation talks with S.F.U. and later Douglas but were unsuccessful at working out the particulars.\nOver the next few seasons Pocomo fought hard, but to limited success and in 2005, Pocomo once again was talking with S.F.U. about merging clubs. At the same time a delegation of Douglas members were quietly talking with some of the Pocomo Executive regarding a similar merger. At the end of the season the Pocomo and S.F.U. voted but both were shy of the required majority. Formal talks with Douglas began and a vote was held shortly after. The clubs voted with large positive majority from both sides.\n\"History provided courtesy of United Rugby Club executive member\"\nDouglas History.\nThe Douglas Rugby Club was established in the spring of 1971 when a group of Douglas College students, organized by Gert Van Niekerk, took part in a 7-a-side tournament hosted by Malaspina College of Nanaimo. That fall, the Douglas College team joined the Pacific Intercollegiate League and finished second with a record of 5-5-1. The team was captained by Howie Martfelt,\nIn 1972, the team won the Totem Conference Championship, playing against the other community colleges in the province. That year's captain was Dave Jagger. Without suffering one defeat, the team continued as Totem Conference champions for the next two years. By this time, the alumni team had formed and took part in a series of exhibition games against local clubs.\nIn 1975, the Douglas College Rugby Club entered two teams in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union 2nd Division. In their first year, the A-Side won the championship and was promoted to the 1st Division for the 1976-1977 season. By the fall of 1977, the club had teams in all three divisions of the FVRU and the 1st Division side won both the league and playoff titles. At the end of that season, the club voted to change its name to simply become the Douglas Rugby Club. The college team had ceased to exist, but the club continued to recruit players from the college.\nDouglas had enjoyed continued success since its inception, particularly with its 1st Division team. The squad won numerous FVRU league titles and playoff championships in 1981, 1983 and 1992. On more than one occasion, the 2nd and 3rd XV have each been champions. The collegiate team was revived in 1990 and won the Northwest Intercollegiate Rugby Union (NIRU) Championship in 1993.\nDouglas first tested the waters in women's rugby in 1974. The team beat Capilano College 36-4 in the Totem Conference Collegiate 7-a-side Tournament. The first serious attempt at women's rugby occurred in the spring of 1977 when a team was formed under the tutelage of Burt Kirby, Mark Andrews and Mark Ovenden. The team was called the Loose Ruckers. They played in the first-ever women's 15-a-side match in the Lower Mainland, on March 6, 1977 against UBC at Jericho Park, losing 8-0.\nThere was very little competition at this time and, after a couple of years of exhibition games, the team dissolved. Some of the original members included Elanie Benson, Sara Lee Liner, Rita Boon, Barb Kirby, Diana Nygaard, Edie Naylor, and Marge Naylor.\nDouglas revived its women's program in the fall of 1991 when a team was entered in the recently formed West Coast Women's Rugby Association (WCWRA). Other teams in the league were Vancouver Rowing Club, Ex-Britannia Lions, and the University of Victoria. Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia also had teams playing a series of exhibition matches. During the first year, the Douglas women were probationary club members. They were accepted for full membership by the 1993-1994 season.\nThe women's program continued to grow stronger, especially with the support of Lou Rene Legge and the Douglas College Athletic Department. In the fall of 1995 the first ever Douglas College Women's Scholarships were awarded to Anne Carnochan and Stephanie Biggar.\nWith expansion of the WCWRA to twelve teams in 1995, Douglas began the year in 2nd Division. After going undefeated for the first half of that season, the team beat UBC Old Boys 10-8 to gain promotion to the 1st Division. The women enjoyed their most successful season in 1996 with a record of 13-3-1, losing to eventual champions Ex-Britannia Lions in the BC semi-final.\nIn the fall of 1996, Douglas expanded its women's program to include two teams. The 1st Division squad enjoyed continued success and the 2nd XV won the BC Championship in 1998. The 1st XV, in the re-dubbed Premiere Division, won championships in 2001 and 2002, while the 2nd Division team won a title in 2003 along with the Under-19 Girls.\nPerhaps the most successful female player to come out of the Douglas program was Kelly McCallum. Her rugby career began almost by accident. McCallum, still dressed in her soccer gear, showed up early to watch the Douglas men play. Finding only a women's match in progress, she decided to stick around and watch. As the team was short one player, McCallum was asked to fill-in on the wing. Quickly taking to the game, she made her way up the ranks to the National Senior Women's Team. McCallum went on to captain Canada in Edmonton during the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup, before her retirement.\n\"History provided courtesy of United Rugby Club executive member\""

He attended John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio and later Indiana State University. He was listed at 6 ft 1 in, 185 pounds during his playing days and growing up his idol was Satchel Paige.\nCareer.\nHe was originally drafted in the 30th round (772nd overall) in the 1989 draft by the Montreal Expos. He did not sign, but in the Houston Astros picked him up as an undrafted free agent.\nSmith spent time in all levels of pro ball (including independent baseball and international baseball) as both a starter and reliever. He was set to be a replacement player for the 1995 season as a result of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike but then had perhaps his best minor league season in with the South Bend Silver Hawks, when he went 10–10 with a 2.67 earned run average. He also struck out 145 batters in 167 innings pitched that year.\nAfter years in the minors, he finally reached the major leagues at the age of 30 in with the Florida Marlins (to whom he'd been traded for Brant Brown). His major league debut (June 30) was impressive-in six innings of work, he gave up six hits, struck out six and only allowed one earned run-a home run by Ron Gant in the first inning, which was also the first hit he ever gave up. He earned no decision in the game. He won his first game on July 27 of that year against the Atlanta Braves-in five innings of work, he walked four, struck out two, and gave up six hits but still managed a win. He completed his first game on September 23 against the Colorado Rockies-albeit a shortened game. He finished his rookie season with a 6–6 record and a 3.23 ERA. Smith received a single vote in National League Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for sixth place with Lance Berkman and Juan Pierre.\nDescribed as being \"...on top of his game when he moves his pitches around...with his incredible control\", Smith \"...smokes his fastball past hitters up high and induces pathetic ground balls with his low off-speed stuff.\" He apparently lost some of that skill in 2001 as went 5–5 with an ERA that jumped to 4.70 while he also gave up the 16th home run in Barry Bonds record breaking 2001 season, when Bonds hit 73 homers. He played his final major league game on July 24, 2001. During his two seasons in the major leagues, he earned $175,000 in 2000 and $240,000 in 2001, respectively.\nIn 2004, Smith pitched for the Richmond Braves and was tied with Alex Graman in leading the International League in strikeouts with 129.\nSmith pitched for the Brother Elephants in the Chinese Professional Baseball League in 2006.\nCareer stats.\nOverall, he went 11–11 with a 3.84 ERA in his major league career in 34 games started.

He played ten seasons in Major League Baseball, between 1982 and 1993, for the Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, Seattle Mariners, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Houston Astros. He was primarily used as a right fielder.\nBiography.\nBorn in Baytown, Texas, Wilson attended Channelview High School and Sam Houston State University.\nWilson was selected in the first round (18th pick) of the 1980 amateur draft by the Tigers. He made his major league debut on April 15, 1982. After the season, Wilson was named Tigers Rookie of the Year. He played two seasons for the Tigers, hitting .292 as a rookie, then driving in 65 runs in 1983, making him a valuable player for a trade. Being only 25, he was then traded on March 24, 1984, along with John Wockenfuss to the Philadelphia Phillies for Willie Hernández and Dave Bergman.\nWilson was best known for his strong throwing arm, and he led all National League outfielders for assists in 1985, 1986, and 1987, throwing out 18, 19 and 20 base-runners from right field, respectively. In 1987, Wilson three times threw out base runners who attempted to reach first base after apparent singles into right field. His most successful season as a batter was in 1985, when he drove in 102 runs, and recorded 167 base hits with 14 home runs in 608 at bats for a .275 batting average. He was selected as a National League All-Star in 1985. On August 5, 1987 Wilson pitched in the bottom on the eighth inning in a game against the New York Mets when the Phillies ran out of relief pitchers and manager Lee Elia put him on the mound. In the only pitching appearance of his career he pitched a 1-2-3 inning, which included striking out Howard Johnson.\nWilson was dealt, along with Mike Jackson and Dave Brundage, from the Phillies to the Seattle Mariners for Phil Bradley and Tim Fortugno at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1987. On September 15, 1988, Wilson hit two home runs off Randy Johnson, the first two homers ever surrendered by Johnson. At the start of the following season, Wilson again tagged Johnson for a homer.\nWilson owned and operated a gas station in Conroe, Texas. From 1988 to 2006, he was a manager in independent minor league baseball for the Amarillo Dillas, Coastal Bend Aviators of the Central Baseball League and the Chillicothe Paints of the Frontier League. He released his autobiography, co-written with Darrell Halk and titled \"Headed Home: A [sic] MLB All-Star's Search for Truth\", in 2012. Wilson is a licensed ordained minister.\nAccording to writer-director Richard Linklater, the character Glenn McReynolds (played by Tyler Hoechlin) in the 2016 film Everybody Wants Some!! is based on Wilson at Sam Houston State. Wilson filed a lawsuit against Linklater for using his name to promote the movie. Wilson did not remember Linklater ever being in a game since he was a freshman, while Wilson was a junior."

        "text": "The Oxford University Ice Hockey Club (OUIHC) is home to the Men’s and Women’s Blues ice hockey teams of the University of Oxford, England. The Men's Blues, also known as Oxford University Blues, is one of the world's oldest ice hockey teams. Tradition places the origin of the team in 1885, when a match is said to have been played against Cambridge University Ice Hockey Club in St Moritz, Switzerland. This date is recognised by the Hockey Hall of Fame, and prior to the 1985 Ice Hockey Varsity Match, the International Ice Hockey Federation formally recognised the 1885 game as the first ice hockey match played in Europe. However, there is no contemporary evidence that this match took place, and Oxford now claims that this was a bandy match.\nHistory.\nThe oldest surviving evidence of their existence is a team photo and roster from 1895, when they played Cambridge in another bandy match at Blenheim Palace. In 1900, they played Cambridge at Princes Skating Club in the first official Varsity Match, winning 7–6. Their captain in this match was future cricketer Bernard Bosanquet.\nWith the introduction of the Rhodes Scholarship, the top Canadian players at the University of Oxford formed the Oxford Canadians, but after World War I, the University of Oxford team included Rhodes Scholars. Such players included Lester B. Pearson, Roland Michener, George F.G. Stanley, Clarence Campbell, Allan Blakeney, Ronald Martland and Otto Lang. Thus strengthened, it won the Spengler Cup in 1923, 1925 and 1931. In 1932, they tied the tournament with LTC Prague.\nIn 1931, the team entered the first English League, winning both the inaugural season and the second. When the league disbanded in 1936, they did not follow most of the teams into the English National League, but in 1938 joined the lower level London and Provincial League. From 1948 to 55, they played in the Southern Intermediate League. After a long break from league competition, they entered two seasons of the Southern League in the 1970s, then joined the Inter-City League and finally played in the first season of the British Hockey League. In 2004 the Blues joined the British Universities Ice Hockey Association league. Today the team is based at the Oxford Ice Rink, and continues to compete in Division One of the BUIHA, as well as playing the annual Varsity Match against Cambridge.\nNotable former players.\nThe Club attracts many Canadian students at Oxford, with most of its prominent former players assuming visible roles in Canadian public life."

He played at representative level for England (Under-16s, and Under-18s), and as a for Great Britain, and at club level for Ashton Bears ARLFC (Under-15), Hindley ARLFC (16+), and in the Super League for the Wigan Warriors and (renamed as the London Broncos in 2012), as a or , consequently he was considered a utility player.\nEarly life.\nMelling was born in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Greater Manchester, England. He was a pupil at Byrchall High School. \nplayed junior rugby league for the Ashton and Hindley junior clubs. Melling is a youth level international for England, touring Australia and New Zealand with England Under 16s in 2001 and also representing England's U18 Academy.\nPlaying career.\nWigan Warriors.\nMelling is a former Wigan Senior Academy captain who made several appearance for the Wigan first team.\nIn 2004's Super League IX it had seemed that Melling's career was in doubt following a serious knee injury suffered playing for Wigan against Leeds at Headingley. Melling had been seen as a future star before having his season ended by a cruciate ligament injury.\nUpon his return to first team action in 2005's Super League X Chris made a further 10 first-grade appearances for the Wigan Warriors before picking up another knee injury requiring further surgery.\nMelling returned to full fitness in 2006, but found first team opportunities limited, due to the emergence of Chris Ashton at the club. Chris Melling moved to in Wigan's academy, impressing enough to be voted as the Under-21s Academy 'Player of the Year' for 2006.&lt;ref name=\"League Playing squad 2006/2007\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHe left Wigan to pursue regular first team rugby league.\nHarlequins RL.\nMelling was initially signed as a back-up to Chad Randall, however the Great Britain international made the position his own. He has been compared to Wade McKinnon with the youngster being defensively solid and dependable, with an eye for a gap bringing the ball out in attack. His move to Harlequins was to have seen the youngster undergo a positional change with a move to hooker. He had been previously employed throughout the backline, with most of his first team appearances coming as an outside back.\nMelling impressed in 2007, starting games at and throughout the backline and scoring four tries. In May 2007 Melling agreed to a new two-year deal with Harlequins Rugby League, midway through his first season at the Twickenham Stoop. This will keep Melling in the capital until 2009. He is seen as the emerging star at the Harlequins, with Harlequins RL investing in young British talent.\nRepresentative football.\nIn June 2007 Melling was called up to the Great Britain squad, and was in the Test match against France. He was joined in the Great Britain Test side by Harlequins teammate Paul Sykes. Melling made his Great Britain début in the 42-14 victory over the French on 22 June 2007, despite carrying an injury.\nPhysiotherapy career.\nMelling became a qualified physiotherapist after studying at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, graduating in June 2006. He hoped to set up his own physiotherapy practise in the future.\nAfter retiring as a player in 2013, Melling joined Warrington Wolves as a rehab specialist and academy physiotherapist, and later worked as a physio at Oldham and Halifax. Melling became head physio at Leigh Leopards in December 2022."

        "text": "The Skeleton Canyon massacres refer to two separate attacks on Mexican citizens in 1879 and 1881. Skeleton Canyon is located in the Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County), which straddles the modern Arizona and New Mexico state line border. This canyon connects the Animas Valley of New Mexico with the San Simon Valley of Arizona.\n1879 Skeleton Canyon massacre.\nThe first Skeleton Canyon Massacre occurred in 1879 when a group of Mexican Rurales were ambushed by cattle rustlers. In July 1879, several rustlers attacked a rancho in northern Sonora, killing several of the inhabitants. After the attack on the rancho, the survivors reported the attacks to Commandant Francisco Neri, who sent out a detachment of Rurales, including Captain Alfredo Carrillo. The Rurales crossed the border into Arizona. As they entered Skeleton Canyon, shots were fired against them. Of the large group that crossed, only three of the Rurales survived.\nNo action was taken by the Mexican Government, but it protested the killings to President Chester Arthur, although acknowledging the Mexican policemen had crossed into Arizona. Johnny Ringo, considered to be one of an outlaw group known as the Cochise County Cowboys, who were cattle rustlers and bandits, claimed to have been at the ambush. He said others there who participated in the murders were Old Man Clanton, brothers Ike and Billy Clanton, \"Curly Bill\" Brocius, Florentino Cruz, and brothers Frank and Tom McLaury.\n1881 Skeleton Canyon massacre.\nIn July 1881, \"Curly Bill\" Brocius learned that several Mexican smugglers carrying silver were heading to Arizona through Skeleton Canyon. Curly Bill and around twenty other men including Johnny Ringo and Jim Crane ambushed the smugglers, killing four and stealing $4,000 in bullion and livestock. Two months after the attack was reported by the surviving smugglers, Commandant Neri again sent a detachment of Rurales led by Captain Carrillo across the border. This time, the Rurales successfully ambushed the Cowboys, killing five including Old Man Clanton and Jim Crane, in what became known as the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre."

Classes include a Prints and Metal class, a Painting/Drawing class and a Clay modeling class. Each May, the school features the artwork of its students in an event known as \"The A-May-Zing art show\" and uses Bowling Green's annual Black Swamp Arts Festival to raise money as well as a Holiday art sale featuring works by local artists.\nStudents can participate in a well-developed performing arts department. They can play an instrument in Band and Orchestra, sing in the choir, and participate in theater productions through the Drama Club.\nThe Band program currently has roughly 150 members, grades 9-12.

        "text": "The Scotland women's national rugby union team ()(Scottish Gaelic Sgioba nàiseanta rugbaidh boireannaich na h-Albarepresents) Represents Scotland in women's international rugby union and is governed by the Scottish Rugby Union. The team competes in the annual Women's Six National Championship and has competed in five of the Women's Rugby World Cups since their hosted debut in 1994. The Nation plays an important role in the rugby world stage.\nHistory.\nScotland Women's first official test match was played against Ireland at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh on 14 February 1993, ending in a 10 - 0 win to the hosts. Leading from the front, first Scotland captain Sandra Colamartino was the scorer of both tries.\nIn April of the following year, Scotland stepped in as alternate host of the 1994 Women's Rugby World Cup, finishing fifth, the team's best appearance to date. Since then, the Women's team have competed in the 1998, 2002 ,2006, 2010 and 2021 iterations of the tournament.\nThe early streak of success peaked on 21 March 1998, as a 8–5 win over England in their final match of the Home Nations Championship marked the achievement of a Grand Slam for Scotland.\nThe Scottish Women's Rugby Union (SWRU) was the national governing body for women's rugby union in Scotland. It was responsible for the governance of women's rugby union within Scotland. Its role was all-encompassing. It went from youth recruitment, through administering all senior based (aged 16+) competition, through to the performance and management of the Scotland women's national rugby union team.\nAt its AGM in June 2009, the SWRU voted unanimously in favour of amalgamating the Scottish Rugby Union and the SWRU to form an integrated national governing body rugby in Scotland.\nThistle and the anthem.\nThe thistle is the national flower, and also the symbol of the Scotland national rugby union team. According to legend the \"guardian thistle\" has played its part in the defence of Scotland against a night attack by Norwegian Vikings, one of whom let out a yell of pain when he stepped barefoot on a thistle, alerting the Scottish defenders. The Latin \"Nemo me impune lacessit\" (\"No-one provokes me with impunity!\" in English) is the motto of Scotland's premier chivalric order, the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle.\n\"Flower of Scotland\" has been used since 1990 as Scotland's unofficial national anthem. It was written by Roy Williamson of The Corries in 1967, and adopted by the SRU to replace \"God Save the Queen\".\nStrip.\nScotland have traditionally worn navy blue jerseys, white shorts and blue socks. On the occasion that Scotland is the home side and the opposing team normally wears dark colours, Scotland will use its change strip. Traditionally this is a white jersey with navy blue shorts and socks. During a sponsorship deal, purple was introduced to the traditional blue jersey. This was a significant departure from the traditional colours of blue and white, although purple is inspired from the thistle flower.\nResults summary.\nOverall.\n\"(Full internationals only)\"\n\"Correct as of 13 October 2023\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nScotland announced a 34-player squad on 19 February. \nOn 25 March, Natasha Logan was added to the squad to replace the injured Sarah Bonar.\nCaps as of 23 March 2023.\nAward winners.\nThe following Scotland players have been recognised at the World Rugby Awards since 2001:\nSee also.\nWomen's international rugby – the most complete listing of women's international results since 1982"

From 2001 to 2005 only 2 posts existed, the Women's Administration Manager and the Girls Development Officer. In 2005, in conjunction with the Scottish Rugby Union, the two posts were re-purposed, with another one created as a result.

Aris' roster, that period, was the strongest the club ever had, as it included top scorers Ganev, Konstantinov and some of the most capable Greek players then available: Alexandropoulos, Papakosmas, Melkas, Mitroudis, Chatziantoniou etc.\nThe club has to demonstrate a very decent and respectful presence in the Greek Cup as well, having reached the final five times. The fact that they had to play all the finals against the season's champions (Olympiacos 4 times and Iraklis 1 time), prevented Aris from winning even one of them. However, they won the Super Cup in 1997.

He also qualified for the Las Vegas Desert Classic for the first time where Darin Young defeated him 2–0 in the opening round.\nThe 2006 World Championship saw Hamilton gain revenge for his defeat to Anderson last year with a 3–2 first round win. He also knocked out Terry Jenkins 4–1 in the subsequent round. However, Hamilton fell to eventual winner Phil Taylor in the third round losing 4–0. Hamilton did manage to gain a share of the prize for highest three-dart checkout by hitting a 170 finish, a feat matched by Taylor. Hamilton reached the quarter-finals of the Las Vegas Desert Classic before being eliminated by eventual runner-up Raymond van Barneveld 3–1. He had defeated Kevin Painter 6–4 and enjoyed a comprehensive 3–0 victory over Matt Clark in the prior rounds. Hamilton made his Winter Gardens debut at the World Matchplay tournament. He sprang something of a surprise in round one by thrashing number four seed Peter Manley 10–2 and then overcame Adrian Lewis in the second round, the duo produced a thrilling match that eventually saw Hamilton triumph 15–13. Hamilton's fine run continued as he defeated crowd favourite Wayne Mardle 16–9 to reach his first major semi-final. However Taylor, a seven time World Matchplay champion, eliminated Hamilton 17–11 in the semi-finals.\n2007–2011.\nHamilton reached the semi-finals of the 2007 PDC World Championship before bowing out 6–0 to eventual runner-up Taylor. Hamilton's campaign began with a 4–3 victory over Mark Dudbridge before defeating Dennis Priestley 4–1 and Jenkins 5–4 in the quarter-finals. He hit 46 180s during the tournament, second only to the overall winner Raymond van Barneveld.\nLater in the month, Hamilton picked up his first PDC Pro Tour title with a 3–1 win over Colin Lloyd in a Gibraltar Players Championship. He had already overcome Andy Smith, Roland Scholten, Jenkins and Alan Warriner-Little on his way to the final. He maintained his form by reaching two semi-finals in Pro Tour events and won his second title in April by beating James Wade in a UK Open Qualifier. Hamilton also made a big impact in the inaugural US Open by winning through to the semi-finals where he was defeated by Van Barneveld. Another semi-final soon followed at the World Darts Trophy, but Hamilton fell agonisingly short of reaching his first major final as he was edged out 6–5 by Gary Anderson.\nHamilton qualified for the first staging of the Grand Slam of Darts by virtue of reaching the semi-finals at the Circus Tavern earlier in the year. Hamilton's fast ascent in the world of darts continued as he won six matches to reach the final where, despite averaging over 100 against Taylor, he lost 18–11.\nHamilton reached the later stages of several tournaments, namely quarter-finals in the 2008 Las Vegas Classic and World Grand Prix. One year later he reached the semi-final of the World Grand Prix. In 2010 he continued the good results at the World Grand Prix reaching the quarter-finals. At the 2011 World Matchplay he reached the semi-final by beating Gary Anderson, John Henderson, and after being 15-8 down against Simon Whitlock, he pulled back and won the game 17–15, winning 9 legs in a row in a remarkable comeback. However he eventually lost to Phil Taylor 17–9 in the Semi finals.\n2012–2015.\nAt the 2012 World Championship he beat Antonio Alcinas 3–2 in the first round, while missing a dart at double 18 in the third set for a nine-dart finish.\nHe then beat Vincent van der Voort 4–3, Dave Chisnall 4–0, and Kim Huybrechts 5–2, to reach the semi-finals for the second time in his career. He played Simon Whitlock and found himself 3–5 down and on the brink of elimination before he produced a super fightback, which included four ton-plus finishes, to prevail 6–5. Hamilton was consistently outscored by the Australian, but his finishing proved to be crucial as he hit 58% of his doubles to secure his first World final and second major TV final. The 200–1 outsider at the start of the tournament could not complete a remarkable victory and clinch the title, however, as he valiantly fought hard throughout but could never get ahead of his opponent, Adrian Lewis, who won the match 7–3. The £100,000 Hamilton picked up for his runner-up spot is the biggest of his career to date and he vowed to go one better in the 2013 tournament. He rose to world number 7 after the event.\nHis performance at the World Championship helped him gain a wildcard place into the 2012 Premier League Darts, where he made his first appearance.\nOn the first night he beat James Wade 8–5, but then did not win another game until the eighth fixture of the campaign which included three successive defeats. However, Hamilton turned his form around and went into the last round of matches knowing a win coupled with results going his way would see him into the play-offs. Hamilton thrashed fellow debutant Kevin Painter 8–1 and did qualify for the play-offs by finishing 3rd in the league. He was unbeaten in the last five matches of the season and played Whitlock in the semi-finals, against whom he drew 7–7 and then beat 8–4 during the league stage. Hamilton led the match 4–1, with Whitlock's solitary leg being a nine-darter, but went on to lose 6–8.\nHamilton then lost 5–9 in the last 32 of the UK Open to Raymond van Barneveld. He reached the final of the tenth Players Championship of the year and held a 5–3 lead over his opponent Colin Lloyd, before losing 5–6. At the World Matchplay he beat Dolan and Mark Webster, but was then defeated 11–16 in the quarter-finals by Phil Taylor. Hamilton won through to his second Players Championship final of the year at the 12th event in September, but lost 4–6 to Simon Whitlock. He then beat Webster and Steve Beaton to make the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix. Hamilton faced Michael van Gerwen and despite making a 160 finish to force a deciding set, he lost 2–3. Hamilton topped his group at the Grand Slam of Darts by winning all three of his games, before taking out four ton-plus finishes to edge past Gary Anderson 10–9. He beat John Part 16–12 in the quarter-finals, and led van Barneveld 6–3 in the semis, before the Dutchman put together a match defining run of nine straight legs and eventually triumphed 16–10. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Hamilton was 14th on the Order of Merit, which qualified him for the Players Championship Finals where he saw off Andy Smith and van Gerwen to play Taylor in the quarter-finals. Hamilton led 9–5 in the best of 19 legs match, on the verge of beating the 15-time world champion for the first time in a televised match, but Taylor came back and with the score at 9–8, Hamilton needed 60 for the match. He missed the board with his first dart and missed double 20 with his last, this being the only dart he had for the match as he lost 9–10.\nHamilton dropped one set in each of his first three games in the 2013 World Championship as he reached the quarter-finals. He played Taylor and lost 0–5, winning just two legs during the match. He threw a nine-dart finish in the third UK Open Qualifier of the year during a third round victory over Tony West, but lost in the following round to Richie Burnett 4–6. By reaching the semi-finals of the 2012 Premier League, Hamilton qualified for the 2013 edition. In week six he enjoyed a 7–3 win over Taylor with an average of 101.40, but he lost six of his last seven matches to finish seventh in the league. Hamilton reached the third major final of his career at the UK Open by producing a superb performance to beat Wade 10–8 in the quarter-finals and survived six match darts from van Barneveld in the semis to win 10–9. He averaged 97 in the final against Taylor who averaged almost 10 points more as he won 11–4. Hamilton vowed to win his first major title following the defeat. He reached the final of the sixth Players Championship two weeks later, but lost 6–1 to van Gerwen meaning he had now not won a ranking event since 2007. Hamilton hit six out of six doubles against Huybrechts in the first round of the World Grand Prix in a 2–0 set win and then beat Painter 3–1 to ensure he reached at least the quarter-final stage of a major for the ninth consecutive tournament. He played Justin Pipe and could only average 75.88 in the double start event and lost 3–1. Hamilton qualified from Group 2 of the Championship League by defeating van Gerwen 6–5 to advance to the Winners Group where he could only win two of his seven games to finish seventh in the table. Hamilton survived a record 18 missed match darts from Part in the first round of the Players Championship Finals as he fought back from 5–1 down to win 6–5 with a 158 checkout and an average of just 75.05. More routine wins over Brendan Dolan and Ian White followed before Van Gerwen defeated Hamilton 10–5 in the semi-finals.\nIn the second round of the 2014 World Championship, Hamilton was defeated 4–1 by Burnett. His early exit, coupled with losing the £100,000 on the Order of Merit from reaching the final two years previously, meant he dropped to world number 11 after the event. Hamilton did not receive a wildcard to compete in the Premier League this year. He won his first ranking title since 2007 at the first UK Open Qualifier in February by defeating Lewis 6–2 in the final whilst averaging 105.27. At the UK Open he lost 9–5 in the fourth round to van Gerwen. At the World Matchplay, he lost in 13–10 the second round to Chisnall.\nHamilton reached the semi-final stage of the European Darts Trophy where he lost to the eventual winner Michael Smith. He was knocked out in the first round of the remaining four major events of the year and could not get out of his group at the Grand Slam, meaning he failed to reach a single major quarter-final this season having reached seven in 2012 and six in 2013.\n2015–2018.\nHamilton met Peter Wright in the third round of the 2015 World Championship and was thrashed 4–0. He lost 9–8 to Kim Huybrechts in the fourth round of the UK Open. After beating Raymond van Barneveld 10–7 in the opening round of the World Matchplay, Hamilton described his play over the last six months as horrible. He went on to lose 13–6 to Phil Taylor in the second round and, after dropping out of the top 16 on the Order of Merit, he failed to qualify for any of the remaining major events in 2015.\nHamilton missed three darts to eliminate Joe Murnan 3–1 in the first round of the 2016 World Championship. The match instead went to a deciding set in which Hamilton missed one dart to force a sudden death leg. It was his first opening round exit in the event after securing at least a second round showing in all of his previous 11 World Championships. He qualified for the third round of the UK Open, but lost 9–2 to Kyle Anderson. \nHe received an entry in to the Players Championship Finals when Anderson was unable to obtain a visa and he was defeated 6–1 by Michael van Gerwen in the opening round. During the course of the year one last 16 appearance was Hamilton's best run in an event.\nHamilton dropped out of the top 32 during 2016 which saw his 12-year run of playing in the World Championship come to an end. He was ranked 53rd on the Order of Merit after the event.\nHamilton lost his PDC tour card at the end of the 2017 season and made the decision to take a year off from playing PDC darts due to personal reasons. He did get through the Riley Pub qualifiers for PDC UK open but failed to make it past the second round.\n2020 onwards.\nOn 19 January 2020, Hamilton regained his PDC Tour Card by finishing fifth on the UK Q School Order of Merit. He will play on the Pro Tour in 2020 and 2021.\nHamilton entered the 2020 PDC UK Open in Round 2, but lost 4–6 in a quality match to Niels Zonneveld, despite averaging 97.49 against Zonneveld's 95.50.\nHamilton picked up £5,500 in total prize money from the Players Championship events he participated in, which placed him 101st in the qualifying order of merit for the 2020 Players Championship Finals race. This tournament includes only the Top 64, hence meaning that Hamilton failed to qualify.\nNevertheless, 'The Hammer' sealed spots in 2 of the 4 European Tour events held in 2020: the PDC Belgian Darts Championship and the International Darts Open, with respective earnings of £2,000 (Last 32) and £3,000 (Last 16). His defeats came to World Champion Peter Wright and the World Number 1 Michael Van Gerwen. Hamilton finished inside the Top 32 (29th) of the European Tour order of merit, securing a return to the 2020 European Championship - the first televised major played during COVID-19 circumstances in front of a crowd since the UK Open in March. Hamilton averaged 87.69 in a 6–1 loss to an inform Devon Petersen, but still picked up £6,000 and a boost in his ranking.\nHamilton will return for a start in Round 1 of the 2021 PDC World Darts Championship, having occupied the penultimate qualifying place on the Pro Tour order of merit for the World Championship. It is expected that the provisional minimal prize of £7,500 will elevate Hamilton in the main order of merit.\nBDO.\nAs part of his Decision to take a year out from the game Andy decided to enter major BDO tournaments from April 2018, reaching the Final of The BDO Welsh Open losing 6–3 to Mike Warbuton and the Quarter Final of the Belgium and Danish open. By the middle of August he had reached 27th in the BDO World Championship rankings giving him an outside shot of qualifying for the end of season event.\nDarts business.\nHamilton is sponsored by XQMax and Autonet insurance. Hamilton previously practiced with Phil Taylor, a fellow resident of Stoke-on-Trent but he now practices with Colin Osborne. Although he temporarily relocated to Derby to be closer to Osborne, Hamilton has since returned to Stoke-on-Trent.\nPersonal life.\nAway from the oche, Hamilton ran the Skylark pub in his home town Stoke-on-Trent, but soon sold the pub to pursue a full-time darts career.\nIn 2012, Hamilton, together with the seven other players who competed in the Premier League recorded a charity single with Chas Hodges and his band called \"Got My Tickets for the Darts\", written by Hodges. It was released on 18 May, the night after the play-offs at the O2 Arena in London, where it was premiered. Proceeds from the single were donated to the Haven House Children's Hospice.\nCareer statistics.\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Prel.)

        "title": "History of rowing sports",
        "text": "The history of rowing as a sport has prevailed it as one of the oldest traditions in the world. What began as a method of transport and warfare eventually became a sport with a wide following, and a part of the cultural identity of the English speaking world. Rowing in its modern form developed in England in the 1700s.\nToday rowing is an amateur sport and an Olympic event. When Pierre de Coubertin created the Modern Olympics, he modelled the International Olympic Committee on the Henley Stewards. The stewards organise the Henley Royal Regatta, one of rowing's most prestigious events.\nMen's.\nEven since the earliest recorded references to rowing, the sporting element has been present. An Egyptian funerary inscription of 1430 BC records that the warrior Amenhotep (Amenophis) II was also renowned for his feats of oarsmanship. In the Aeneid, Virgil mentions rowing forming part of the funeral games arranged by Aeneas in honour of his father.\nIn the 13th century, Venetian festivals called \"regata\" included boat races among others. Nowadays, rowing competitions are still called \"regattas\" (with a second 't' added).\nThe first known 'modern' rowing races, began from competition among the professional watermen that provided ferry and taxi service on the River Thames in London. Prizes for wager races were often offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies or wealthy owners of riverside houses. (ref, The Brilliants p14). During the 19th century these races were to become numerous and popular, attracting large crowds. A contemporary sporting book lists 5000 such matches in the years 1835 to 1851. \nPrize matches amongst professionals similarly became popular on other rivers throughout Great Britain in the 19th century, notably attracting vast crowds on the Tyne. The oldest surviving such race, Doggett's Coat and Badge was first contested in 1715 and is still held annually from London Bridge to Chelsea.\nAmateur competition in England began towards the end of the 18th century. Documentary evidence from this period is sparse, but it is known that the Monarch Boat Club of Eton College and the Isis Club of Westminster School were both in existence in the 1790s. The Star Club and Arrow Club in London for gentlemen amateurs were also in existence before 1800. At the University of Oxford bumping races were first organised in 1815 while at Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827. The Boat Race between Oxford University and Cambridge University first took place in 1829, and was the second intercollegiate sporting event (following the first Varsity Cricket Match by 2 years). The interest in the first Boat Race and subsequent matches led the town of Henley to begin hosting an annual regatta in 1839.\nIn America, there is also a sizable rowing community. Ports such as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia required the building of many small rowing boats, and competition was inevitable. The first American race took place on the Schuylkill River in 1762 between 6-oared barges. As the sport gained popularity, clubs were formed and scullers began racing for prizes. Professionals were rowing against clubs and each other before the civil war. Races were often round trips to a stake and back, so that the start and finish could be watched. The public flocked to such events, and rowing was as popular in America during the 19th century as other professional sports are today. In 1824, ferrymen from the Whitehall Landing at Manhattan's Battery raced a crew from the British frigate HMS \"Hussar\" for $1,000. Thousands bet on the event and the Americans won. In 1838, six men formed the Narragansett Boat Club in Providence and today Narragansett Boat Club is the oldest rowing club, and the oldest athletic club in America. In 1843, the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale University. The Harvard–Yale Regatta is the oldest intercollegiate sporting event in the United States having been contested every year since 1852 (except for occasional breaks due to major wars, such as World War II and the US Civil War). The oldest inter-high school competition in the United States also occurred on the water, in the form of a race in six-man boats between two New England boarding schools: Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, and Phillips Academy Andover in Andover, Massachusetts. The oldest continuous rowing club in America is the Narragansett Boat Club, in Providence, Rhode Island, founded in 1838.\nFISA, the \"Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d’Aviron\" in French (or the English equivalent International Federation of Rowing Associations) was founded by representatives from France, Switzerland, Belgium, Adriatica (now a part of Italy) and Italy in Turin on 25 June 1892. It is the oldest international sports federation in the Olympic movement.\nFISA first organised a European Rowing Championships in 1893. An annual World Rowing Championships was introduced in 1962. Rowing has also been conducted at the Olympic Games since 1900 (canceled at the first modern Games in 1896 due to bad weather).\nStrong rowing nations include Great Britain, the United States, Italy, Netherlands, France, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Romania. Well-known rowers of recent years include Sir Steve Redgrave (UK), who won Olympic golds in five successive Olympics; Sir Matthew Pinsent (UK), who won golds in four successive Olympics; James Tomkins (Australia), three times Olympic gold medalist; Rob Waddell (New Zealand) and Xeno Müller (Switzerland), opponents in the single sculls.\nWomen's.\nFor most of its history, rowing has been a male dominated sport. Although rowing's roots as a sport in the modern Olympics can be traced back to the original 1896 games in Athens, it was not until the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal that women were allowed to participate – well after their fellow athletes in similar sports such as swimming, athletics, cycling, and canoeing.\nWomen have competed in rowing events as far back as the fifteenth century. When Beatrice d'Este visited Venice in 1493, a regatta was held in which fifty peasant women competed. There were professional women rowers, referred to as \"Roddarmadam\", managing and dominating the water ferry in the archipelago of the Swedish capital of Stockholm from the 15th century up until the late 19th century.\nWomen's rowing in modern times can be traced back to the early 19th century, and an image of a women's double scull race made the cover of Harper's Weekly in 1870 . St Hugh's College, Oxford owned a boat for use by its women students as early as 1891; it was stored at the River Cherwell and students \"who can swim 50 feet\" were permitted to use it. In 1892 four young women (Zulette Lamb and Lena, Agnes, and Caroline Polhamus) started ZLAC Rowing Club in San Diego, California when they borrowed a boat and began rowing on San Diego Bay. The club considers itself the oldest all-women's rowing club in continuous existence in the world. Newnham College Boat Club was formed the following year in Cambridge, England. In 1927, the first Women's Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge universities was held (for the first few years it was an exhibition, and it later became a race). And in 1954, the women's events were added to the European Rowing Championships. In 1988, the first Henley Women's Regatta was held. On 27 April 1997, one of the last bastions of rowing was breached when, at an Extraordinary General Meeting, Leander Club voted to admit women as members. This rule met a condition imposed by UK Sport and qualified Leander to receive a £1.5 million grant for refurbishment from the Lottery Sports Fund. In 2015, the Women's Boat Race was combined with the men's race on the River Thames in London.\nAt international level, women's rowing was dominated by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, until the collapse of the communism. Since then the most successful rowing nations have included Germany, Netherlands, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand: countries that have rivers and lakes suitable for rowing on. The United States also has often had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's collegiate rowing, and the establishment of the NCAA Rowing Championships for women.\nWell-known rowers of recent years include Ekaterina Karsten (Belarus) in women's single sculls; Kathrin Boron (Germany) in women's double sculls and quadruples."

        "title": "Ron Flockhart (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Ronald Everett Flockhart (born October 10, 1960) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He is the brother of Rob Flockhart.\nPlaying career.\nRon Flockhart scored over 300 NHL points in the 1980s playing mostly with the Philadelphia Flyers and St. Louis Blues. After an impressive season with the Regina Pats during the 1979–80 Western Hockey League season, he was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Flyers. While he played most of the '80–81 season with the Flyers' AHL affiliate Maine Mariners, he appeared in 14 regular season and three playoff games for the parent team. His best NHL season came the following year, as Flockhart averaged a point a game, scoring 33 goals and assisting on another 39 for 72 points. Though he enjoyed another solid year in 1982–83 with 29 goals and 60 points in 73 games, the Flyers as a team continued to have trouble advancing in the playoffs. After a slow start at the beginning of the '83–84 season, Flockhart was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins as part of the trade that brought Rich Sutter to Philadelphia.\nFlockhart spent the next two seasons playing for the Penguins and Montreal Canadiens, and in 1985–86 joined the St. Louis Blues where he tallied 22 goals and added 45 assists. It was his highest point total since his first season with the Flyers. Over the next few years, Flockhart's playing time fell with the Blues, and he ended his NHL career with a four-game stint on the Boston Bruins. Although Flockhart's NHL career was at an end, his professional career continued for a few more years with SG Cortina and Bolzano HC in Italy.\nFlockhart's style was often called \"Flocky (or Flockey or Flockie) Hockey\" for his tendency to rag the puck rather than move it quickly up ice.\nAwards.\nAccording to Gene Hart, former play-by-play television and radio commentator for the Philadelphia Flyers, Flockhart won the \"Grizzly Award\" each year he played for the Flyers. As recollected in his autobiography \"Score: My 25 Years With the Broad Street Bullies\", Hart created this \"award\" for the NHL player born in Smithers, BC who had the highest point total at the end of each NHL season. Hart originally coined the award as a joke between Joe Watson and his younger brother Jimmy Watson, both low scoring Flyers defencemen who were born and raised in Smithers (and at the time were the only two players from this small British Columbia town). With the emergence of Flockhart, he became a lock for the award during his NHL playing days.\nCoaching.\nFlockhart also coached the Dallas Freeze of the Central Hockey League for 3 seasons (1992–93 through 1994–95) as well as the Reno Renegades (later called the Reno Rage) of the WCHL between 1995–96 and 1997–98."

        "title": "Lancaster Red Roses (basketball)",
        "text": "The Lancaster Red Roses were a professional basketball team based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. From 1946 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1955, they played in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, of which the Red Roses were one of the six original teams. The Red Roses also played briefly as the Lancaster Rockets. They were members of the Eastern Basketball Association from 1975 to 1978, and the Continental Basketball Association from 1979 to 1980. The Red Roses were members of the American Basketball League briefly in the 1946-47 season, where they were known as the Lancaster Roses.\nHistory.\nEven though the Lancaster Red Roses never won the EPBL championship, they drew many fans to the Lancaster Armory, their home court. Stan \"Whitey\" Von Neida, who set a league record with 46 points in one game and nearly 700 points scored in a 30-game season, was the main draw for many Lancaster fans. Von Neida lead the Red Roses to the President's Cup finals, and a big three-game series against the Wilkes-Barre Barons.\nThe Lancaster Red Roses had a perfect 15-0 record at the Lancaster Armory (it would take another 40 years before another EPBL team, the 1990-91 Albany Patroons, would go undefeated at home during the regular season), the team had to move their post-season games to J. P. McCaskey High School because the Lancaster Armory's bleachers were scheduled for removal following Franklin &amp; Marshall College's winter sports season. Although McCaskey High was a bigger venue than the Lancaster Armory, the Roses played the regular season at the Armory because the School District of Lancaster did not allow Sunday professional games to be played in its facilities.\nLancaster and Wilkes-Barre met for the inaugural \"President's Cup\" finals, but there was a dispute over where the games would be played. In the semifinals, each competing team flipped a coin to determine who would host the decisive third game. Both Lancaster and Wilkes-Barre arrived to the finals on the momentum of 2-0 playoff sweeps, but because both teams were fiercely devoted to their home field advantages, neither team would agree to play a decisive game on the opponent's home court. The final game of the President's Cup was played on a neutral court, Rockne Hall in Allentown, which the Red Roses lost.\nAfter the 1946-47 season, the Red Roses and the Barons left the EPBL, joining the American Basketball League. After losing five of their first six games in the ABL, the Red Roses rejoined the Eastern League for 28-game season. Although the team retained most of its original ABL roster, they were without Whitey Von Neida, who joined the Tri-Cities Blackhawks of the National Basketball League (which later become the National Basketball Association).\nThe Red Roses' third season was a disaster. The team started league play about two weeks after the rest of the teams had their home openers, and stumbled through a 2-3 record in their first five games. After missing a scheduled road game to Williamsport, the Roses were suspended from play by EPBL President William Morgan, ruling that the Roses did not make a viable effort to get to Williamsport for the game. After Lancaster owner Rothermel Wise and business manager Benny Volk explained they could not make the trip due to hazardous road conditions, Lancaster was restored to the EPBL. A few days later, the Red Roses filed for bankruptcy, claiming liabilities of $3,824.05 and assets of $548.15. Immediately the Red Roses franchise was terminated from the league, with a new entity, the Lancaster Rockets, assuming the rest of the Red Roses' scheduled dates.\nThe Continental Basketball Association also hosted the Lancaster Lightning from 1981-1985. After the 1985 season, the Lightning moved to Baltimore and eventually to Rockford, Illinois where they became the Rockford Lightning."

        "text": "Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball is a baseball video game released in North America by Acclaim Entertainment during the years of 1991 and 1992 for the NES, Game Boy, Super NES, and Sega Genesis. All of the ballplayers have the likenesses and abilities of the 1991 Major League Baseball players they represent. However, since the game is not licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, the only player whose name appears in the game is, of course, AL Cy Young Award Winner Roger Clemens. The 26 teams featured in the game correspond to the 1991 MLB teams as well, though team nicknames have been changed due to the lack of an MLB license as well.\nIn 1993, the game was released in Japan as and was only published for Nintendo's Game Boy and Super NES platforms.\nKingsley Thurber, the composer for \"Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball\", also did the music for the Super NES version of \"Mortal Kombat\" along with \"Virtual Bart\", \"Looney Tunes B-Ball\" and various WWF video games.\nGameplay.\nThe game features 26 teams to use, an exhibition mode and a regular season mode consisting of 162 games. The game allowed players to \"save\" their career progress by giving them a password. Players had to memorize it and enter it at the menu screen when they wanted to continue the season.\nBy pushing a certain sequence of buttons on the Super NES version, a screen can be accessed where the variables for offense (pitchers/runners) and defense (fielding) can be edited. Another test mode can be found by virtue of using either Game Genie or Pro Action Replay on the Super NES version; which acts more like a traditional cheat menu then the debug menu.\nThe Super NES controls puts more emphasis on defense rather than offense as the majority of possible move combinations correspond to pitching a baseball to the batter. Base running is considered to be of secondary importance in the game while batting is considered to be simple by Super NES standards.\nCriticism.\n\"Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball\" is scolded for having an inferior sense of gameplay to \"Bases Loaded 2\"; which was also a baseball game featuring an entirely fictional cast of ballplayers. The confusing angles for fielding essentially ruin the enjoyment of following the ball's shadow in order to put out a runner.\nPlayer Name Humor.\nWhile many of the fictional players in the game have names that are simply mutations of their real names (i.e. \"Gaddox\" and \"Fieldman\" are Greg Maddux and Cecil Fielder respectively), the game programmers appear to have had a bit of fun with some of them, poking fun at the names of some of the real players they are intended to represent. Some examples follow below:"

        "title": "Riddick Bowe Boxing",
        "text": " is a multiplatform boxing video game released in 1993. It was also released for the Game Boy and Game Gear consoles.\nThe game was released for the Super NES in Mexico and, partially, in American Southwest states, as Chavez and starred Julio César Chávez instead of Riddick Bowe. It is identical except that the Spanish language is used instead of English.\nOverview.\nRiddick Bowe Boxing features gameplay that was practically identical to that featured in \"Greatest Heavyweights.\" The graphics are similar in function, but the artwork was completely redrawn. The visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers and a simple boxing ring. The game features a career mode in which the player fights their way through all the boxers in the game until facing Bowe himself. The game also features an exhibition mode in which players can play as any boxer and put them in matches against any boxer in the game.\nGameplay.\nDuring the fight.\nDuring a fight, each boxer has a healthmeter that decreases whenever the player is hit. When the health meter reaches zero and the player is punched the player suffers a knockdown. Large amounts of punishment to the head also result in visible cuts.\nIf a boxer is knocked down three times in a single round, the fight ends in a TKO. Unlike in real-life boxing matches, a fight never stops for other reasons; a boxer can be pummeled for an entire fight without throwing one punch in return, but unless he is knocked down three times, or he fails to get up in ten seconds after being knocked down, the fight is allowed to continue until the round ends or fight scheduled goes the distance.\nCareer mode.\nDuring career mode, the player creates his own boxer. Options to edit include name, hair color, skin color. Each boxer in the game had three attributes: power, stamina, and chin. Riddick Bowe has the highest stats, but starts losing them after losing the championship. Eventually, he retires in the course of the game's career mode, after which only resetting the internal data will bring him back.\nDuring career mode, all of the attributes are increased by allotted training bonuses. As the boxer progresses from match to match, his statistics start to fade. After 35 fights, his hair turns from normal to grey. After 40 fights, the boxer is forced to retire even if he has never beaten the champion. Losing two fights in a row will also cause the player's boxer to retire.\nReception.\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the SNES version a 7.2 out of 10 average, commenting, \"Quite simply, this is the best boxing game for the SNES out there. The punches of your player are incredibly easy to do and it controls like a dream.\" Reviewing the SNES \"Chavez\" release, \"GamePro\" noted that it has \"abundant options\" but deemed it a mediocre game due to the rudimentary gameplay and uninvolving graphics and sounds. They also warned prospective buyers that the game and manual are both in Spanish.\nReviewing the Game Gear version, \"GamePro\" criticized the lack of backgrounds and weak sound effects, and said of the gameplay, \"Somehow, your fighter moves around and blocks punches, even if you don't press any buttons. The buttons you do press don't respond quickly or accurately enough to make you feel like a champ.\""

A robot named Eagle is banned from participating in the world's professional golfing tournaments due to discrimination. Eagle has the ability to play golf better than a human being, but is denied the chance to play with human individuals. A benefactor purchases Eagle and builds a golf course for him to practice on. The player's skill determine whether humans or robots are truly better at golf. Various modes (lesson, driving range, competition) help the player practice his abilities that he will need in future matches.\nJapanese professional golfer Nobuo Serizawa endorsed the Japanese version of the game. However, the Western version of the game replaced his likeness with Eagle the robot. There are two possible background sounds that can be played while golfing; a simple tune for relaxation or a complex melody for \"excitement.\"\nGameplay.\nUpon starting a game, the player must either \"sign up\" (create a new profile) or use an existing profile of the Hyper Golf Club (referred to in the Japanese version as the \"Lake Side Golf Club\"). It is possible to save a game while in the middle of a golfing session. Through practice and the driving range, duffers can improve their maximum yardage, their handicap, and eventually get promoted from duffer status. \"Semi-pro\" and \"pro\" levels are considered to be the two highest levels a video game golfer can receive in this video game.\nEmergency lessons offer advice when a player is about to perform a mistake in the practice (learning) mode of the game. After the 13th hole, the players must use a small boat to get to the 14th hole regardless of what mode the player is using. Like most Super NES golfing games, the clubs are selected automatically for the player, and the player must aim the ball and strike it with accuracy and balance. Players get to choose between four sets of golf clubs. As the player plays in various months of the year, the golf course changes according to the season.\nThe Japanese version features an all-male group of Japanese golfers, while the Western version has caucasian \"family members.\""

        "title": "River surfing",
        "text": "River surfing is the sport of surfing either standing waves, tidal bores or upstream waves in rivers. Claims for its origins include a 1955 ride of along the tidal bore of the River Severn.\nRiver surfing on standing waves has been documented as far back as the early-1970s in Munich, Germany, today offering the world's largest urban surfing spot.\nStanding waves.\nIn this type of river surfing, the wave is stationary on the river, caused by a high volume of water constricted by flowing over a rock and creating a wave behind. A requirement for this is a flowing water with shallow depth in which the inertia of the water overcomes its gravity due to the supercritical flow speed (Froude number: 1.7 - 4.5, surpassing 4.5 results in direct standing wave) and is therefore neither significantly slowed down by the obstacle nor pushed to the side. It is a form of hydraulic jump. A river surfer can face up-stream and catch this wave and have the feeling of traveling fast over water while not actually moving.\nRiver surfing conditions are created by a combination of underlying rock formations and specific water levels, i.e. not too much or too little water. Water flow is usually measured in the SI-unit cubic meters per second (m³/s) (alternatively in liters per second or cubic feet per second).\nEurope.\nGermany.\nDespite being many hundreds of kilometres from the nearest ocean, Munich has a reputation as a surfing hotspot, offering one of Europe's best waves. The Bavarian capital is the birthplace of river surfing. The city has been the center of surfboard riding on a stationary wave since the early 1970s. Up to 100 surfers daily hit the waves in the city's Englischer Garten, the largest urban park in the world. There, in the river Eisbach, the world's best known river surf spot, the Eisbach wave — literally “ice brook” — the flow velocity of the icy water is about 5 meters per second, at a flow rate of 20 m³/s (equivalent to a mass of 20 tons per second), and the temperature never gets above 15 degrees Celsius. An annual surfing competition is held on the standing wave. Additionally, there are further stationary waves that form on the river Isar just downstream of the \"Wittelsbacherbrücke\" bridge in Isarvorstadt, as well as on the canal that joins the Isar channel with the \"Floßlände\".\nMunich has produced the best river surfers and was the first location that created a true surfing community around an inland river wave. The scene has around 1,000 active surfers, while 10,000 in Munich will have tried it at some point.\nAustria.\nOn Austria's river Mur in Graz (Styria), river surfing is a regular on two waves built for surfing in 2001 and rebuilt in 2004 by KanuClub Graz.\nNear Salzburg in the Alm Canal there is a custom built surf wave, the Almwelle.\nNorway.\nNorway has several river waves, amongst the most famous are:\nSeveral artificial river waves are either under planning or have been considered:\nSwitzerland.\nThe Limmat in Zürich does not have any standing waves but is fast-flowing. Local surfers have developed a pulley system known as upstream surfing which allows surfers to surf the river.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nThe Habitat 67 standing wave in the Lachine Rapids in Montreal, named for its location adjacent to the Habitat 67 housing complex, has become a popular destination for river surfing. Corran Addison, an Olympic kayaker and three-time world freestyle kayak champion, was the first to surf the Habitat wave in 2002. His river-surfing school, Imagine Surfboards, has taught 3,500 students since 2005. A second Montreal river-surfing school, KSF, has hosted 1,500 students a year since 2003. From fewer than 10 original surfers, it is estimated that the current of participants numbers around 500.\nThe Ottawa River in Ottawa has long been a river surfing destination for both locals and travellers. Local surf shops specialize in river surfing gear and boards. Average wave height varies between one and two meters. The waves are most accessible in the spring with some remaining rideable year-round.\nIn the 2000s, transplanted ocean surfers began riding standing waves in a number of rivers in Alberta, Canada. Several shops in Calgary now stock boards specifically designed for river surfing. The standing wave under the 10th Street bridge in Calgary, has been a popular place for river surfing since its formation after the 2013 Alberta floods Since the mid-2010s, the Alberta River Surfing Association is spearheading transformative river wave projects in Southern Alberta, including a river park in downtown Calgary and Cochrane. The most popular area to river surf around Southern Alberta is in Kananaskis district (45 min from Calgary) at a spot called Mountain Wave. As of the early 2020s, projects of building two additional adjustable man-made river waves are well under way.\nUnited States.\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is known as the most famous river surfing community in the US. The first documented cases of surfing on the Snake River occurred in the late 1970s. The wave known as Lunch Counter is a standing wave that churns during times of snow runoff in the months between May and August each year. This wave is highly active during these months and the area continues to grow as a surf destination.\nPueblo, Colorado, has also become a river surfing city. A kayak park was in built 2005 near downtown Pueblo and locals have been surfing features 3, 4, and 7 ever since.\nMissoula, Montana, has surfing on Brennan's Wave, a man-made wave on the Clark Fork River.\nBoise, Idaho, has surfing at the Boise Whitewater Park near downtown Boise. The Boise River Park features an adjustable man-made wave on the Boise River. Because the waveshaper is adjustable, river surfing is available nearly year around. The \"Surfer's Journal\" article \"The Surf God's of Idaho\" says surfing Boise's river is like \"pausing the ocean with a remote control and pressing rewind, but then surfing that backward-flowing wave in forward motion\".'\nBend, Oregon, has an adjustable man-made river wave in Bend White Water Rapid Park for all season surfing.\nSalida, Colorado has a whitewater park with six different features and a thriving river surfing scene. In fall of 2022, hydrologists from Recreation Engineering and Planning (REP) based in Salida engineered a wave specifically for surfing. The wave, called the Scout Wave 2.0, is meant to perform at even moderate water levels, opening up the season. River surfing is happening in Salida all year long on the Scout 2.0.\nNew Zealand.\nThe world's first commercial river surfing operation was started by Jon Imhoof in 1989. Trips are run on the Kawarau River near Queenstown. Bodyboards are used to run rapids and ride standing waves on the river.\nTidal bores.\nTidal bores occur in relatively few locations worldwide, usually in areas with a large tidal range (typically more than between high and low water), and where incoming tides are funnelled into a shallow, narrowing river via a broad bay. Large bores can be particularly dangerous for shipping, but also present opportunities for river surfing. The funnel-like shape not only increases the tidal range, but it can also decrease the duration of the flood tide, down to a point where the flood appears as a sudden increase in the water level. The tidal bore occurs only during the flood tide, never the ebb tide.\nA tidal bore can create a powerful roar that combines the sounds caused by the turbulence in the bore front and whelps, entrained air bubbles in the bore roller, sediment erosion beneath the bore front and of the banks, scouring of shoals and bars, and impacts on obstacles.\nTidal bores are being surfed along coastal rivers such as the pororoca on the Amazon River or England's River Severn.\nSevern bore.\nSurfing the Severn bore has become a competitive sport with dozens of surfers vying to record the longest ride. The tidal surge also attracts canoeists and windsurfers. The present champion surfer is Dave Lawson from Hempsted, Gloucestershire, who has covered 5.7 miles on a surfboard. His record-breaking surf took more than 35 minutes and was logged by an official adjudicator from the British Surfing Association.\nPororoca bore.\nThe pororoca is a tidal bore, with waves up to 4 metres high that travel as much as 13 km inland upstream the Amazon River.\nPetitcodiac bore.\nTidal bores are backwards-moving waves that travel upstream over forward-moving downstream waves. They occur twice a day on the Petitcodiac River in the Bay of Fundy, driven up the river by the world's highest tides. The North American record for surfing a single river wave was set by J.J. Wessels and Colin Whitbread of California, who rode the Petitcodiac River bore for 29 kilometres on 24 July 2013.\nUpstream river waves.\nAn upstream river wave is a phenomenon with a similar appearance to tidal bores, but is, just like a coastal wave, caused by ocean swells instead of tides. Similar to tidal bores, they form in the ocean and travel up the river.\nBuilding river surf waves.\nRiver surfing is gaining popularity around the world. Boise Whitewater Park's Wave Technician, Paul Primus, shares the dual benefit of installing recreational river features to replace dangerous low head dams everywhere. Building river surf waves can also help save lives.\nReplacing old low head dams with river recreation features can have many benefits - low head dam hazard abatement, river navigability, fish passage, flood mitigation, sediment transport, river blight removal, diversion infrastructure modernization, significant economic impact, provision of swiftwater training facilities, public health benefits, and introduce opportunities to help reduce regional youth drowning rates.\nSafety.\nDangers associated with river surfing is hypothermia, drowning and blunt trauma. A significant and serious hazard are stainers, or logs in the river that can cause surfers to get pinned or become entangled. Board strikes to the head can cause injuries. If the water is cool, the surfer may dress in a wetsuit, neoprene boots and gloves. Even if the temperature is high, it is recommended to use footwear in order to avoid cuts from rocks in the river. Care should also be taken not to stand on the river floor where the water is moving. Leg entrapment may occur. Some choose not to use a leg rope (\"leash\") since there is a potential for the leash to get hung up in rocks, which can cause drowning if the surfer is unable to reach the hook-and-loop fastener due to strong currents. Depending on the river, it may also be appropriate to use a personal flotation device and helmet. To reduce danger, the surfer should also train specifically on swimming technique for rivers. When falling, one should try to fall as \"flat\" as possible so as not to hit rocks lying on the bottom of the river. If the surfing is done with the help of water ski rope or other type of rope fixed to shore, there should be at least one person on shore with a knife, scissors or other cutting tools available in case the rope needs to be cut for safety reasons, for example if the surfer gets tangled in the rope. River surfing is not risk free, and there have been deaths."

Smith won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match in the 2013 Challenge Cup Final as Wigan defeated Hull F.C. 16–0 at Wembley Stadium. \nHe was also part of the Wigan team that beat the Warrington Wolves 30–16 in the Super League Grand Final as Wigan earned the rare distinction of a Super League and Challenge Cup double. \nHe ended the year with selection in the Super League Dream Team.\nAfter goalkicker Pat Richards returned to the NRL at the end of the 2013 season, Matty Smith was given the goalkicking duties for Wigan. Smith also kicked 6 drop goals in the 2014 regular season for Wigan as well as earning a spot in the 2014 Super League Dream Team. On Friday 19 September, a night after Smith scored 21 points in the 57–4 playoff rout against the Huddersfield Giants, he signed a new four-year contract with the Warriors. \nHe played in the 2014 Super League Grand Final defeat by St. Helens at Old Trafford.\nHe played in the 2015 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.\nHe played in the 2016 Super League Grand Final victory over the Warrington Wolves at Old Trafford.\nSmith signed a new 2-year deal, On 11 October it was announced Matty had signed a 4-year deal with former club St. Helens for the beginning of the 2017 season.\nSt Helens (2017-2018).\nOn 23 June 2017, Smith kicked a long range field goal in the final second of the match against Salford to secure Saints a 25-24 victory. St Helens had been down by three converted tries in the latter stages of the game before staging the comeback.\nIn 2018, he made seven appearances for St Helens as they won the League Leaders Shield but fell short of a grand final appearance losing to Warrington.\nLes Catalans (2019).\nIn 2019, he joined Les Catalans Dragons. On 5 December 2019, he was released by the club after making 16 appearances. He also had a loan spell with Warrington in 2019.\nInternational career.\nAfter a stellar 2014 season Smith was selected in England's 24-man squad for the 2014 Four Nations held in Australia and New Zealand. Smith played in all 3 of England's matches.\nIn 2015 Smith was selected in England's 24-man team for the end-of-year internationals but did not feature in the test against France or in the first two tests of the three-match test-series against New Zealand. He was a late call-up in the final test-match at the Wigan Warriors's home ground, DW Stadium, in place of Wigan teammate George Williams. He was influential in the final game delivering a man-of-the-match performance.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2015, Smith set up a business with former Salford team mate Stefan Ratchford called Future Stars, which runs coaching sessions for junior rugby league players."

In year 9 he started at St Mary's College Toowoomba where he would finish his schooling.\nPlaying career.\nWhile with the Brisbane Broncos, he also played for the Past Brothers in the Queensland Cup.\nMurphy played for the New Zealand Warriors on the wing in their 2002 NRL Grand Final loss to the Sydney Roosters.\nMurphy joined the Catalans Dragons club at the end of 2004 when the club was in the national French competition. He quickly established himself as one of the better players, topping the try scoring charts and helping the club become the first French team to go through a season without defeat, winning the Coupe de France and the French championship where he was man of the match in the Final. It was his first full season in Super League that saw him shoot to prominence. He finished as Top try-scorer in 2006's Super League XI with 26 tries and also making the Super League \"Dream Team\" despite his team, the Catalans Dragons coming bottom of the table.\nIn 2007, Murphy rose to public attention after suffering a spectacular injury in a match against Wigan Warriors. While running to try and claim a chip kick, he was pushed innocuously in the back by Pat Richards and went flying towards the advertising hoardings which surround the pitch. Trying to jump over the danger, his feet caught the hoardings and his neck and back were slammed into the concrete steps at the bottom of the stand. Murphy played on for almost an hour before eventually being substituted, where it was revealed he had broken ribs and he was subsequently sidelined for 6 weeks.\nHe was part of the French squad for the 2008 World Cup.\nFollowing retirement, Murphy moved to Toowoomba."

        "text": "Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball is a multiplatform baseball simulation game that was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, featuring the likeness, motion captured movements, and \"Big Hurt\" branding of player Frank Thomas.\nAll the teams, statistics, and players are meant to simulate the 1995 Major League Baseball season. Acclaim released a successor to the game also featuring Thomas and actual major league teams, \"All-Star Baseball '97 featuring Frank Thomas\".\nGameplay.\nFeaturing realistic pitching, realistic batting, and a realistic likeness of Frank Thomas himself for the game's era, there are also regular season and exhibition modes.\nPitching and batting can be done either in a high, medium, or low direction (in addition to slow, medium, or fast pitching) for greater realism. Greater emphasis was placed on defense and pitching, as opposed to more offense-oriented baseball video games like \"World Series Baseball '95\". Games often take place at night; especially at Wrigley Field.\nGames can be played to a minimum of two innings and a maximum of nine innings (plus any extra innings that occur in a tied game). All the teams in the game can be edited through a special edit screen; this allows players to replace teams that they do not like with their home towns that do not have Major League Baseball teams.\nMore than 700 players with Major League Baseball contracts appeared in the game.\nDevelopment.\nFrank Thomas's animations in the game were created from several days of motion capture filming Thomas at Acclaim's in-house studio during Spring 1995.\nPorts.\nA conversion of the game was in development for the Atari Jaguar CD after Atari Corporation and Acclaim announced their partnership in March 1995 that included plans to release three titles for the system, including \"Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball\". The port was originally slated to be released around the fourth quarter of 1995 and was later slated for an April/Q2 1996 release, but work on the port was discontinued sometime in 1995 and was never released.\nReception.\nReviewing the Genesis version, \"GamePro\" said the game has \"nothing awful\", but is also short on exceptional features. The reviewer praised the animation but criticized the slow-moving fielders, inauthentic representations of real world ballparks, \"jagged\" voice tracks, and graphical glitches. A different \"GamePro\" critic reviewed the Super NES version and was more negative: \"Watching Little League players would be more exciting than struggling with Big Hurt's shoddy controls, scant features, and no-brainer action.\" He also criticized how tightly the camera follows the ball during fielding. \"Next Generation\"s brief review of the Super NES version stated, \"Combing simulation aspects with a traditional baseball game, \"Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball\" shows signs of innovative but flawed thinking. Most of the simulation aspects are in the pitching, which quickly becomes a tiresome chore. The rest of the game is a sub-par replica of several other baseball titles.\"\nThe two sports reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" both gave the PlayStation version a 7.5 out of 10. They remarked that the attention to detail in the stadium sounds and visuals make the game very realistic, and that while the control is somewhat \"sluggish\", it works well once learned. \"GamePro\" said that the motion-captured animation is excellent, but that against other PlayStation baseball games such as \"Triple Play 97\", \"Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball\" does not hold up well due to the lack of key options such as changing the batter's stance and speed bursts while running. The same \"GamePro\" reviewer gave a more positive recommendation for the Saturn version, while noting that he only did so because the Saturn did not have as many outstanding baseball games as the PlayStation yet. Both \"GamePro\" and \"Next Generation\" found the Saturn version a major improvement over the Super NES version, with \"Next Generation\" calling it \"an extremely solid game with little flaws that keep it from being great.\" The reviewer called the graphics \"extraordinary\", while his criticisms included the somewhat difficult interface and the delay in the batting controls. Rob Allsetter of the British \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" chiefly commented on baseball's lack of mass appeal in Britain, and argued that though \"Big Hurt\" is good by the standards of a baseball video game it would only appeal to those who are fans of the sport.\n\"GamePro\" gave the Game Boy version a brief negative review, commenting that \"The graphics make hitting a nightmare. When the ball is on its way, it gets lost in the green background. Every swing of the bat sounds like a skier slushing down the slopes.\" They were much more approving of the Game Gear version, saying it \"offer smooth gameplay and excellent control along with such options as Season and All Star games.\"\nLegacy.\nIn October 2018, the game's rights were acquired by Canadian production company Liquid Media Group along with other titles originally owned by Acclaim Entertainment."

        "text": "In ice hockey, a grinder is a player better known for his hard work and checking than his scoring. A grinder is often a player who has limited offensive skills, but is valuable to a hockey team due to physical forechecking skills especially along the boards; for \"grinding along the boards\". The grinder is not in the spotlight as would be the offensively skilled scoring stars, but they are often fan favorites due to their work effort in games. A grinder is often the player who, by their willingness to endure the physical abuse of going into the corners to dig out the puck, often sets up the goals by getting the puck to the team's offensive stars. It is common belief in hockey that a good team needs a balance of scoring stars and grinders.\nWhile grinder often refers to a player of lesser offensive skills, this is not always the case. NHL Hall of Fame inductee Bobby Clarke of the 1970s and 80s Philadelphia Flyers was considered a grinder, but was also a highly productive offensive player. While a \"grinder\" plays a physical style of hockey they are distinguished from an \"enforcer\". While most \"grinders\" will fight, some do not; \"grinder\" refers specifically to a style of defensive hockey which is within the rules of the game. Sometimes grinder is used in combination with \"mucker\" to describe a player as a \"mucker and a grinder\", although it is used as emphasis. In this context, mucker is largely synonymous with grinder.\nIndicative of the importance of the grinder is that Bobby Clarke and Mike Eruzione, both grinder-style players, played major roles in their respective countries' victories over the offensively-skilled Soviet Union national team. Clarke was a significant factor in Team Canada's victory in the 1972 Super Series, as was Eruzione as captain for the United States' Olympic team in the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" victory. Clarke received the Selke Trophy as best defensive forward late in his playing career.\nIn 2012, \"The Hockey News\" named Dave Bolland of the NHL Chicago Blackhawks as \"Best Grinder\"."

The Amiga and TurboGrafx-16 versions include a league mode and enhanced 16-bit graphics.\nReception.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" called the MS-DOS version best as an arcade game, and, because of its lack of real players' statistics, less successful than competitors as a simulation. \"Nintendo Power\" gave the NES version a 2.8 out of 5 in September 1991. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in October 1991."

        "text": "Major League Baseball on CBS Radio was the de facto title for the CBS Radio Network's coverage of Major League Baseball. Produced by CBS Radio Sports, the program was the official national radio broadcaster for the All-Star Game and the postseason (including the World Series) from 1976 to 1997.\nHistory.\nHistorically, the sports coverage now produced by Westwood One was branded as CBS Radio Sports and, like the news features, associated with the CBS Radio Network; however, after CBS began managing the original Westwood One in the mid-1990s, the sports broadcasts would come under the Westwood One banner (with both identities used in the late 1990s), a practice that would continue even after CBS stopped managing Westwood One in 2007. CBS launched a 24/7 sports radio network, \"CBS Sports Radio\" in fall 2012 through Cumulus Media Networks, owned by Cumulus Media (Cumulus Media Networks was merged into Westwood One in 2013, following Cumulus' acquisition of Westwood One).\nContracts.\nCBS first broadcast Major League Baseball in the early days of network radio, sharing World Series coverage with NBC beginning in 1927 and All-Star Game coverage beginning in 1933. Mutual joined them in ; the three networks continued to share coverage of baseball's \"jewel\" events through , with Mutual gaining exclusive rights to the World Series in and the All-Star Game in . NBC, in turn, would have exclusivity for both events from 1957 through 1975.\nIn , CBS Radio carried Saturday regular-season Brooklyn Dodgers home games played at Ebbets Field, simulcasting the team's local WMGM radio broadcasts with Red Barber and Connie Desmond announcing. The CBS simulcasts, which were sponsored by General Foods, were blacked out in major league cities but otherwise aired nationally.\nFrom –, CBS Radio paid US$75,000 per year for rights to the World Series, All-Star Game, and League Championship Series. In the network added regular-season Saturday \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts.\nBy , CBS Television would get into the Major League Baseball broadcasting business (having last done so in ). This particular partnership would last through the season. Meanwhile, CBS Radio would pay Major League Baseball US$50 million for 1990–1993 radio rights to the \"Game of the Week\" and \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as the All-Star Game, League Championship Series, and World Series.\nFollowing the season, CBS Radio signed a six-year contract worth US$50.5 million. Following the 1994 strike and the dissolving of \"The Baseball Network\" (a planned six-year-long television joint venture involving ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball), the television contracts had to be realigned. Ultimately, \"Major League Baseball on CBS Radio\" would last through the season before being succeeded by \"Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio\".\nThe \"Game of the Week\".\nIn , CBS Radio started broadcasting a weekly \"Game of the Week\". CBS Radio usually did two games each Saturday, one on the afternoons and another during the evenings. Typically, CBS' markets aired only the afternoon broadcasts. The games covered varied from the ones NBC-TV were offering at the time to games outside of NBC's sight.\nOne notable exception was KCBS in San Francisco, which almost always carried the evening games. In , just before the strike, KNBR carried the broadcasts in San Francisco and finally aired some of CBS' afternoon games. However, following the strike, KNBR dropped CBS' regular season broadcasts, and with the exception of , when all playoff games were played at the same time, they usually only carried one or two Division Series games on days when there were three games played.\nAs previously mentioned, CBS Radio would also eventually follow ESPN television's suit, and broadcast Sunday night games (something ESPN started in ). John Rooney and Jerry Coleman usually called these games while Jim Hunter hosted the pregame show entitled Inside Pitch.\nCBS Radio's local coverage.\nCBS Radio was the largest broadcaster of local Major League Baseball broadcasts. In 2005 and 2007 respectively, CBS dropped the St. Louis Cardinals from KMOX and the Pittsburgh Pirates from KDKA, ending two long relationships between the teams and their flagship stations. However, KMOX reacquired the Cardinals' broadcast rights in 2011, and KDKA's FM sister all-sports station acquired the Pirates' broadcast rights in 2012, in addition to New York Yankees games being renewed on WCBS after the conclusion of the 2011 season, they would have the rights until the end of the 2013 season.\nCBS's WFAN is the flagship station of the New York Yankees (they had broadcast the Mets until 2014) and WSCR is the flagship station of the Chicago Cubs. In Philadelphia, WPHT, a frequency that had been the longtime home of the Philadelphia Phillies before parting ways after the 2001 season, reacquired the team's broadcast rights in 2005. As of 2012, those games are now simulcast on sister station WIP-FM. KRLD-FM in Dallas was the flagship station for the Texas Rangers before the 2011 season.\nIn 2015, the Chicago Cubs moved its radio broadcasts to CBS property WBBM (AM) from its longtime home of WGN (AM). That same year, the Baltimore Orioles began its second stint on all-sports WJZ-FM, four years after it was moved back to its traditional home of WBAL (AM). In 2016, the Cubs rights moved to sister station WSCR as part of a pre-arrangement in the 2015 agreement where WSCR would take over airing games after letting the rights to the Chicago White Sox go after the 2015 season (which now broadcast on WGN (AM)).\nDuring the 2010s, at least seven teams were on stations owned by the company: \nIn addition, three teams had been on CBS-owned stations until the 2010–11 \"hot stove\" period:\nCommentators.\nThe \"Game of the Week\".\nFrom –, the two announcers calling the games at hand split play-by-play duties. From until the end of its coverage in , CBS Radio used Jeff Torborg and Al Downing (as well as Rick Cerone in 1997) as color analysts paired with the play-by-play announcers.\n\"The Home Town Inning\".\n\"The Home Town Inning\", traditionally featuring a visiting team announcer calling the top of the fifth with the home team announcer calling the bottom of the fifth, was featured on CBS Radio postseason games from – and on regular season games from –.\nFull list of commentators.\nPlay-by-play commentators included:\nOther commentators (roughly in order of first appearance) included: \nDivision Series and League Championship Series commentators.\nJim Hunter called the American League Championship Series alongside Johnny Bench from 1990–1992. In , Hunter teamed Ernie Harwell to call the ALCS. And in and respectively, Hunter called the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series alongside Jerry Coleman. In , Hunter called the American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Texas Rangers with Gary Cohen.\nWorld Series commentators.\n1970s.\nWhen CBS Radio took over World Series rights from NBC Radio in 1976, they continued the old practice of having the local team announcers do the play-by-play for the World Series games in the road market of that home team's broadcasters through 1978. Thus, Bill White got call do all three World Series involving the New York Yankees on CBS Radio from 1976–1978 and Ross Porter with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977–1978. In addition, CBS Radio used Marty Brennaman in 1976, when his Cincinnati Reds played against White's Yankees.\nIn 1977, Bill White did CBS Radio play-by-play for the games in Los Angeles while Ross Porter handled the games played in New York. Thus, when White was working on ABC-TV during that series, it was during the home games in a pre/postgame role (White would eventually cover the trophy presentation ceremony for ABC). Likewise, Ross Porter handled White's TV role while in Los Angeles. From 1976–1978, Win Elliot was always in the booth either as a host or color man but never he did play-by-play for CBS Radio's World Series coverage. Elliot was in a sense, the designated \"network\" participant on the broadcasts since he hosted the \"CBS Sports Roundup\" and other events for CBS Radio like horse racing events. Meanwhile, Ralph Kiner served as the pre and postgame host. In New York, the 1977 World Series was carried by two radio stations, WCBS and the Yankees' then flagship station, WMCA. WCMA simply carried the same CBS feed as did WCBS since separate radio broadcasts with the local announcers wouldn't begin until 1984.\nIn 1979, CBS Radio, following the lead begun by ABC's television coverage in 1977, dropped the usage of the local broadcasters on play-by-play. They stopped using local announcers altogether when Vin Scully began doing the World Series as a CBS employee through 1982. (Beginning in 1981, however, participating teams' flagship radio stations were permitted to produce their own local World Series broadcasts and air them live. The affiliate stations in the teams' radio networks continued to be obligated to carry the CBS Radio broadcasts.)\nDuring the 1980 World Series, thousands of Philadelphia Phillies fans were outraged that they could not hear their local team announcers call the games. They deluged the team, the networks, and the Commissioner's office with angry letters and petitions. The following year Major League Baseball changed its broadcast contract to allow the flagship radio stations for participating World Series teams to produce and air their own local Series broadcasts, beginning in . The CBS Radio feed could potentially be heard in those markets on another station which held CBS's rights. WPHL did a \"re-creation\" of the game with Harry Kalas, Richie Ashburn, and Andy Musser using the NBC video, which aired in November along with the National League East division clinching game in Montreal and three games from the NLCS against Houston. When the Phillies next won a World Series, in , Kalas was able to make the call of the final out.\nAfter the season, Scully left CBS altogether to do baseball play-by-play for NBC on television (a role that he had through the end of the season). In Vin Scully's absence, came Jack Buck, who would call the World Series for CBS Radio from 1983 through 1989.\nIn 1985, KMOX, the St. Louis Cardinals' flagship station at the time, simulcast with CBS Radio's World Series coverage involving the Cardinals. That was mainly because Jack Buck had a lengthy career calling Cardinals games for KMOX to go along with his national work for CBS Radio.\nIn 1990, Buck would move over to CBS-TV to call the World Series and Scully returned to CBS Radio to take his place following NBC's loss of television rights. Scully would continue to call the World Series on through 1997 (CBS' last before the contract moved to ESPN Radio).\nWorld Series moments.\n1985 World Series.\nDespite his long and illustrious career, Don Denkinger is probably best remembered for a blown call he made at first base in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series, played on October 26. The St. Louis Cardinals led the Kansas City Royals by 3 games to 2. The Cardinals had taken a 1-0 lead in the 8th inning on a single by little-used backup catcher Brian Harper after pitchers Danny Cox (of the Cardinals) and Charlie Leibrandt (of the Royals) had battled back and forth all game long. Todd Worrell came into the game for the Cardinals in the 9th inning, first facing Jorge Orta, the leadoff batter for the Royals. Orta hit a slow roller to first baseman Jack Clark, who tossed to Worrell covering first base.\nDenkinger was the umpire at first base and called Orta safe, even though television replays and photographs clearly showed that he was out by half a step. The Cardinals argued briefly, but Denkinger refused to reverse it. The Royals went on to win Game 6 by the score of 2-1.\n1986 World Series.\nThe following is a word-for-word transcript of Jack Buck and Sparky Anderson's commentary during the final moments of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series:\nJ: Mookie Wilson is the batter...he has a hit...one out of three...a switch hitter, he'll bat left. Moments ago, the Red Sox were one strike away. Now they're one out away. Here's the pitch...and a foul strike one...back into the seats and Wilson wasn't taking. Howard Johnson is on deck, we mentioned earlier he stayed in the game.\nS: Mookie's not bashful, he's not afraid to swing this bat. He's not concerned right now...he wants a base hit.\nJ: Next pitch from Stanley is a ball and it's one and one...they hold against Ray Knight, he is not a threat to steal. The batter is Mookie Wilson, one ball one strike, two on, two out...way high ball two, as Stanley slipped coming of the pitching rubber. The on deck batter is Howard Johnson and this thing, this game has been at the finish line three or four times. 5-4 Boston, bottom half of the tenth inning, 5-4, first and third two out, and a foul puts Boston within a strike of the title again. It evens the count to Mookie Wilson, that ball in on him, two and two.\nS: Don't be surprised if you see his palmball right here.\nJ: First and third. Tying run at third, winning run at first, two out, the pitch! a swing and a...foul tip, he just got a piece of it and that's how close Boston was to nailing it down. A foul by Mookie Wilson keeps him up there. two balls two strikes. The Mets have scored here in the tenth, they trail 5-4 trying to send us into tomorrow night. Here's the pitch! Swing and a foul, back and out of play and Wilson hammered at one outside, in the strike zone I think, stays 2-2. Mitchell the tying run at third, a base hit ties it for New York, a long one could win it, a home run would win it, the pitch! Ball three! Wild pitch! We're gonna be tied! The ball went off the glove of the catcher. We're 5-5 in the bottom of the tenth. Unbelievable, it's 5-5 and now the winning run is at second with two out. A breaking ball handcuffed Gedman, a breaking ball handcuffed the catcher and Mitchell raced home with the tying run and Mookie Wilson could win it here. They have a base open and Howard Johnson up next. That run charged to Schiraldi. The 3-2 pitch on the way, swing and a high pop foul going out of play. And it gives everybody a chance to collect their collective breath as the Mets have scored two here in the tenth after scoring a run in the eighth to pull it out of the bag again.\nS: Boy if this don't remind you of that California Angels-Boston series, nothing will...\nJ: And a full count on Mookie Wilson, he can win it with a hit. Ray Knight is at second base. Here's the pitch! Swing and a foul out of play, and I'll tell you this folks. If the Mets win this tonight, man, there will be no holding them tomorrow, Dennis Boyd or no Dennis Boyd.\nS: They'll come out here looking like they're on stilts.\nJ: It stays three and two, let's look ahead to the Boston eleventh inning. Evans will lead it off. Isn't this unbelievable. A couple of times Boston was a strike away from winning. You remember that little foul tip just before? What did they call it? Wild pitch or passed ball?\nS: I think they called it a wild pitch.\nJ: Wild pitch. Here's the pitch to Mookie Wilson. Winning run at second. Ground ball to first, it is a run...an error! An error by Buckner! The winning run scores! The Mets win it 6 to 5 with three in the tenth! The ball went right through the legs of Buckner and the Mets with two men out and nobody on have scored three times to bring about a seventh game, which will be played here tomorrow night. Folks, it was unbelievable. An error, right through the legs of Buckner. There were two on, nobody out, a single by Carter, a single by Mitchell, a single by Ray Knight, a wild pitch, an error by Buckner. Three in the ninth for the Mets. They've won the game 6-5 and we shall play here... tomorrow night! Well, open up the history book, folks, we've got an entry for you...What do you think, Sparky?\nS: I never seen nothing like it. Here you got two out, two run lead, you figure Carter up, he can't even hurt you. He gets a base hit, another base hit, another base hit...wild pitches, ball rolls through the guys legs. I've never seen nothing like it, Jack.\nJ: It will be Boyd against Darling tomorrow night.\nS: Yogi Berra is the greatest human being who ever lived. He said, it's not over 'til it's over.\nJ: This game is now history and it deserves its own page...\n1988 World Series.\nFor CBS Radio's coverage of the 1988 World Series, Jack Buck provided play-by-play while Bill White served as the analyst. This was Buck's call of the final moments of Game 1. It begins here with Buck speculating on what might happen if Kirk Gibson manages to reach base: \"... then you would run for Gibson and have Sax batting. But, we have a big 3-2 pitch coming here from Eckersley. Gibson \"swings\", and a fly ball to deep right field! \"This is gonna be a home run!\" Unbelievable! A home run for Gibson! And the Dodgers have won the game, 5 to 4; I don't believe what I just saw!\"\nThe last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with, \"I don't \"believe\" what I just saw! Is this really happening, Bill?\"\nMoments after Kirk Gibson's home run, Jack Buck told his listeners, \"I've seen a lot of dramatic finishes, in a lot of sports, but this one might top almost every other one.\"\n1989 World Series.\nOn October 17, , commentators Jack Buck, Johnny Bench and John Rooney, were on hand at San Francisco's Candlestick Park for Game 3 of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. At 5:04 p.m. local time, the Loma Prieta earthquake hit (and subsequently caused a ten-day delay for the World Series). Unlike ABC-Television (with Al Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver calling the action on the TV side), CBS Radio was in a commercial break when the earthquake struck. After the earthquake hit, Jack Buck told the listening audience, \"I must say about Johnny Bench, folks, if he moved that fast when he played, he would have never hit into a double play. I never saw anybody move that fast in my life.\"\n1991 World Series.\nOn October 27, , Vin Scully, along with Johnny Bench and John Rooney, was on hand for a game considered by fans to be one of the most intense in the sport's history. Game 7 of the already exciting World Series (between the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves) was scoreless going into the ninth inning, and an emotionally drained Scully said, \"After eight full innings of play, Atlanta nothing, Minnesota nothing... I think we'll be back in just a moment.\" In the bottom of the tenth inning, Gene Larkin won the game for the Twins with a high fly-ball into left field (which allowed Dan Gladden to score) off Alejandro Peña.\nThe following is Scully's description of the final moments of Game 7:\nThe day prior, this is how Scully described Kirby Puckett's game winning home run to send the 1991 World Series to a seventh and decisive game in the first place:\n1996 World Series.\nDuring his CBS Radio broadcast in 1996, Vin Scully made another memorable call in the third inning of Game 1, when 19-year-old rookie outfielder Andruw Jones became the first National League player to hit two home runs in his first two at-bats in a World Series.\n1997 World Series.\nFor CBS Radio's final World Series to date, the seventh and decisive game between the Florida Marlins and Cleveland Indians went into the bottom of the 11th inning with the score tied 2–2. This is how Vin Scully described the final moments of that game:\nBefore CBS Radio signed off from their baseball coverage for the final time on October 26, 1997, Vin Scully and Jeff Torborg delivered this final message to listeners:\nVin Scully: Tonight's game sponsored by CBS television, by Countrywide Home Loans, by Horrick, and by the U.S. Army. Our producer Norman Baer, our engineers Stem Gehan and Sam Carroll, our studio coordinator Andrew Holmlund, our PR reference has been John Ralph of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and assisting us in the booth, Dale Torborg. Once again the final score from Miami, the Marlins 3, Cleveland 2. This will be our last broadcast for CBS. Jeff, I must tell you what an absolute delight and pleasure it has been to sit here and share the broadcast with you, you're outstanding.\nJeff Torborg: Vin, coming from you that means a great deal. You are not only a Hall of Fame announcer, you are more than a Hall of Fame person. And I, I respect you so much and so grateful that we have a friendship and have that for a lot of years, thank you.\nScully: If we never work together I will never forget these years and thank you. I'd like to thank John Rooney, who is indeed a part of the group and to our loyal producer Norman Baer, whose done such a great job over the years. And for us that figures to wrap up our World Series work for CBS. So once again the final score, Marlins 3, Cleveland 2. The Marlins are the World Champions. Our congratulations to both teams. "

        "title": "World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association",
        "text": "The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) is the governing body of professional snooker and English billiards. It is headquartered in Bristol, England. Founded as the Professional Billiard Players Association (PBPA) in 1946, with Joe Davis as chairman, it was revived in 1968 after some years of inactivity and renamed the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association in 1970. Its current chairman is Jason Ferguson.\nThe WPBSA devises and publishes the official rules of the two sports. It promotes their global development at the grassroots, amateur, and professional levels; enforces conduct regulations and disciplines players who breach them; and works to combat corruption, such as by investigating betting irregularities. Additionally, it is involved in coaching development and the training of referees.\nThe WPBSA owns a 26 per cent share of World Snooker Ltd, which organises the professional World Snooker Tour. It also supports World Women's Snooker, World Disability Billiards and Snooker, and English billiards through World Billiards.\nOverview.\nAccording to its financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2019, the principal activities of the WPBSA are \"the governance of professional snooker and billiards through the regulation and application of the rules of the association, the development of snooker and billiards as a sport and the sanctioning of the Professional Snooker Tour\". The governing body for the non-professional aspect of snooker and billiards is the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF).\nThe WPBSA has a number of associated organisations, including World Snooker, World Billiards, World Women's Snooker and World Disability Billiards and Snooker.\nIn November 2020, the members of the WBPSA voted to separate the responsibilities of the Association between two entities: \"WPBSA Governance and Development\", and a new \"WPBSA Players\" organisation. WPBSA Governance and Development will be responsible for disciplinary matters, monitoring betting, and drug testing. WPBSA Players will be responsible for support and representation of players.\nJason Ferguson became the WPBSA chairman in 2010, having previously held the role from 2001 to 2003. Rex Williams was chairman for 13 years until 1987, when he was replaced by John Virgo. Previous presidents include Jeffrey Archer, who served from 1997 to 1999.\nHistory.\nA Professional Billiard Players Association (PBPA) was formed on 26 July 1946, with Joe Davis as chairman. The professional game was in decline in the 1950s and 1960s and the PBPA was also dormant until being restarted in April 1968 with eight professional members. Mike Green was designated as the Secretary. Membership of the Association was by application, with playing achievements and disciplinary records the main factors taken into account. This means of becoming professional was later replaced by a series of \"pro ticket\" events. Prior to the formation of the WPBSA, the world governing body of both snooker and English billiards was the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC or BA&amp;CC), later known as the Billiards and Snooker Control Council.\nThe BACC announced in August 1968 that the world professional snooker championship would be run on a knockout basis, rather than the challenge system that had been in place from 1964, and in September 1969 that \"The BA &amp; CC and Professional Billiard Players Association have reached agreement regarding procedure for turning professional and other events governed by the BA &amp; CC.\"\nThe PBPA disaffiliated from the BA&amp;CC from 1 October 1970, and was renamed the WPBSA on 12 December 1970, soon taking control of the running of the professional game.\nThe WPBSA was reorganised as a limited company on 13 January 1982, with the intention that it would negotiate contracts with television companies and sponsors, something that had previously been in the control of promoters like Mike Watterson, as well as organising the tournaments. In 1985, Green retired as Secretary and was succeeded by Martin Blake, at which point the Association moved its headquarters from Birmingham to Bristol.\nIt was reported during the 1987 World Snooker Championship that WPBSA chairman Williams was taking beta blockers. These were banned under International Olympic Committee rules, but not prohibited in snooker. Colin Moynihan, a British MP, called for Williams to resign and any players using beta blockers to withdraw from competing.\nIn 2001, in a legal case brought by Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams and their management company, the WPBSA was found to have taken advantage of its dominant position in the snooker market by forcing its members to seek permission to play in tournaments, which could allow the WPBSA to prevent rival organisations from competing with it. Former WPBSA chairman Geoff Foulds lost a libel case that he had brought against \"The Daily Mirror\" when it accused him of submitting falsified expense claims to the WPBSA.\nWhen World Snooker scheduled the 2008 Bahrain Championship on dates which clashed with Premier League Snooker matches scheduled five months earlier with World Snooker approval, this caused four leading players (including Higgins) to miss the Bahrain event and consequently lose ranking points—Higgins called the clash \"laughable\". Premier League organiser Barry Hearn commented that \"I am very disappointed and I can't understand why World Snooker hasn't discussed dates with us\", while Higgins and his manager Pat Mooney threatened legal action over the ranking points situation. Supported by a number of senior players, Hearn became the chairman of the WPBSA in December 2009, with Mooney also joining him on the board.\nThe body received criticism in the late 2000s. John Higgins had been particularly vocal in his opinion that World Snooker had not done enough to promote the game in new territories, particularly in Eastern Europe. The rival World Series of Snooker was launched by a consortium including Higgins in 2008.\nIn 2008, the Association's benevolent fund was investigated for accounting irregularities and the apparent involvement in the decision-making process of WPBSA officials. The decision to decline an application for a grant from Chris Small, a former player who retired due to Ankylosing spondylitis, was also criticised by several of the game's leading figures.\nPromotional activities.\nA subsidiary promotions company, WPBSA Promotions Ltd, was founded in 1983. World Snooker has been successful in promoting the sport in China, a major growth area for the sport, and in other territories including Germany.\nThe 2008 Bahrain Championship was the first ranking tournament to be staged in the Middle East, which cost the organisation around £500,000 in prize money and organisational costs. One session at the event did not attract any audience, and the largest attendance for any of the sessions was 150. In 2019, World Snooker announced that there would be a ranking event in Saudi Arabia in 2020, the first in a ten-year series. Amnesty International criticised the announcement due to concerns about human rights in the country.\nThe WPBSA supports coaching in cue sports through an accredited programme, and in 2013 initiated the \"Cue Zone into Schools\" programme, which took scaled-down tables into schools and was intended to interest school children in taking up the game. In 2019, the WPBSA announced the creation of an all-party parliamentary group for snooker, chaired by Conor Burns, a Member of Parliament (MP).\nIn 2015, the Association submitted an unsuccessful bid for snooker to be played at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Another bid has been put forward for Paris 2024 through a branch of the association formed in 2017, the World Snooker Federation."

        "title": "Wimbledon Stadium",
        "text": "Wimbledon Stadium, also known as Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, was a greyhound racing track located in Wimbledon in southwest London, England.\nIt also hosted stock car and other small circuit motor racing events, and until 2005 hosted motorcycle speedway. The stadium hosted the English Greyhound Derby every year between 1985 and 2016.\nFacing declining attendances and with no renovations undertaken for many years, the stadium was put up for sale by the owners, the Greyhound Racing Association, and closed permanently in March 2017. The site was purchased by Galliard Homes Limited, in order to build 600 new apartments and a new football stadium, the new Plough Lane, for AFC Wimbledon. The stadium was demolished in 2018 to clear the site for the new development; it was one of London's last remaining greyhound stadia, leaving only Crayford and Romford remaining, and was the third to close since the year 2000 after Catford in 2003 and Walthamstow in 2008.\nStadium.\nThe facilities originally included a brick-fronted grandstand, seating 8,000, executive suites, several bars, and catering facilities, including a large waiter-service restaurant. The stadium was surrounded by a large open-air car park, which hosted car-boot sales on Saturdays and Sundays for many years.\nGreyhound racing.\nOrigins.\nThe greyhound stadium was constructed east of the River Wandle on a section of marshland which was difficult to build on and was prone to flooding. The only buildings nearby were a chamois leather mill, a large sewage works, and the Plough public house. Slightly to the east was Summerstown Road, which held the only housing in the immediate area.\nThe difficult plot did not deter South London Greyhound Racecourses Ltd., who went ahead with plans to build a large stadium ready for 1928. However, financial difficulties halted the project until a consortium headed by Bill 'WJ' Cearns, whose firm had been responsible for the construction of the stadium, stepped in with sufficient funds to save the project.\nOpening.\nThe first race on opening night, 19 May 1928, was won by a greyhound named Ballindura trained by Harry Leader. The Burhill kennels in Walton-on-Thames became renowned within the industry for housing the hounds for Wimbledon, and were used by trainers Stan Biss, Harry Leader and Ken Appleton. Paddy McEllistrim, a Norfolk farmer and breeder of greyhounds, and Sidney Orton, joined the training kennels soon after.\n1928–1939.\nWimbledon was the first track to introduce weighing scales in 1929 at their kennels, so that the racing public could be issued with the greyhounds' weights before racing. The same year, Harry Leader returned to Ireland and was replaced by Sidney Orton. New events named the Puppy Derby, International, Wimbledon Gold Cup and Wimbledon Spring Stakes were all inaugurated.\nIn December 1929 Arundel Kempton purchased Mick the Miller for £2,000 as a present for his wife, and placed him with Sidney Orton. The track had already been associated with Mick the Miller because the champion took up residence at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim during the duration of the 1929 English Greyhound Derby. Con Stevens was the first Racing Manager and was instrumental in bringing the first classic race to Wimbledon in the form of the Laurels in 1930. Mick the Miller claimed his second Derby crown in 1930, propelling himself, the sport, and Wimbledon into national fame.\nTrainer Joe Harmon arrived from White City in 1934, and Paddy Fortune, another new trainer at Wimbledon, claimed a second Derby victory for the track in 1939, with greyhound Highland Rum. The 'Two Year Old Produce Stakes' was introduced in 1935, and another event named 'The Key' began in 1936.\n1940s.\nDuring World War II the stadium suffered bomb damage but continued to operate. The well-known Irish dog Tanist was put with Paddy McEllistrim, but found it hard to cope with the sharp turns at Wimbledon, and failed to win a single race by the end of June 1940. By contrast, Ballynennan Moon became a household name during the war years after becoming a Wimbledon greyhound, with Billy Quinn negotiating the sale to Mrs Cearns, wife of the managing director of Wimbledon Stadium. In 1942, after a winter rest, he won the Walthamstow Stakes and Wimbledon Spring Cup, before embarking on forty wins and seven second places from 48 starts. After finishing first fourteen times in succession, he was beaten by a neck by Laughing Lackey, narrowly failing to beat Mick the Miller's 19 straight wins record.\nA new puppy named Ballyhennessy Seal first came to the scene in 1943 after moving from Catford Stadium to Wimbledon, and was placed in the care of Stan Martin. Martin had joined the Wimbledon training ranks following the death of Joe Harmon in 1942. Martin guided Ballyhennessy Seal to a third Derby success for the track in 1945.\n1950s.\nAfter the war the Wimbledon management constructed a new grandstand in place of the war damaged section of the stadium. They also introduced new perforated tote tickets following continual losses on forged tote tickets every Saturday to the tune of £1,000. Ballymac Ball was the next greyhound to win the Derby for Wimbledon, the brindle dog winning the 1950 event for Stan Martin. In 1950 the Instaprint photo timer was tested at Wimbledon, and given the seal of approval to use throughout Britain.\nCon Stevens continued to manage the stadium throughout the 1950s, overseeing the success of the track. A fifth Derby success came in 1957, after the Dennis Hannafin (brother of Jerry) trained Ford Spartan took the title. In 1958 Paddy Fortune died, and his kennels were taken over by George Waterman. Within a few months, Sidney Orton retired and his son Clare Orton took up his position at Wimbledon, with Clare having been a trainer in his own right for nearly ten years.\n1960s.\nPhil Rees Sr. joined the track as a trainer in the 1960s following the retirement of Dennis Hannafin, and the Greyhound Express Merit Puppy Championship was renamed the Juvenile in 1963. George Waterman died, and his Burhill kennel range was given to new trainer Nora Gleeson. The three-time Derby winning trainer Paddy McEvoy also joined the track in the late 1960s. Towards the end of 1969, the possibility of the stadium being redeveloped became a possibility, but the Greyhound Racing Association bought a major stake in Wimbledon after a prolonged battle against developers.\n1970s.\nMurmurings about redevelopment remained as GRA Property Trust continued to buy and sell stadiums, but the GRA chose to invest in the stadium, raising the winning prize money levels of the Laurels to £2,000 in 1970 and £5,000 one year later. In 1972, the GRA sealed a deal to buy Wimbledon Stadium outright, and bring the track fully under the GRA banner. Paddy McEllistrim and Stan Martin both retired in 1974, and were replaced by Paddy's daughter Norah, and by Sam Sykes, a former head lad to Clare Orton. Con Stevens resigned from the board of directors at Wimbledon, bringing to an end his 46 years of association with the track.\nWimbledon introduced new technology in 1976 after using a sectional timing mechanism, and were one of the first tracks to use the system of grading (selecting greyhounds in classes on ability). In the same year, Mutts Silver, trained by Phil Rees Snr., won the Derby; Rees handed his kennels to his son Philip Rees Jnr. just two years later after retiring.\n1980s.\nWimbledon was chosen to host the sport's premier event, the 1985 Greyhound Derby, following the closure of White City in 1984. Industry support for Wembley to be given the premier race was inconsequential, since GRA owned the rights to the competition and would not allow a non-GRA track to have the race. Bob Rowe, Chief Racing Manager for the GRA, was Racing Manager at Wimbledon when the track was handed the Derby, and trainers Tom Foster and David Kinchett both joined from White City. The first Derby at Wimbledon was held over a new distance of , and ended with a seventh success for the track. Pagan Swallow won the competition, and the Rees family became the second father and son to each win the Derby. Arthur Hitch joined the tack in 1987 when Slough Stadium closed, and following the closure of Harringay Stadium the prestigious Oaks for bitches was relocated to Wimbledon.\n1990s.\nIn 1990 a greyhound called Druids Johno was given to Prince Edward; the half share of the black dog had been given to the Prince by Patsy Byrne during a charity meeting at Kingsmead Stadium, Canterbury. Byrne joined Wimbledon as a trainer in 1991, and sponsored the long-running International in the process. This appointment brought about the last Derby triumph for the track, with Ballinderry Ash taking the 1991 title to bring the total to eight, just one behind Wembley.\nIn 1992 GRA parent company Wembley PLC announced losses of £8 million, despite a £13 million profit in its UK operation. Simon Harris arrived from Hall Green to become Racing Manager, with Bob Rowe remaining at Wimbledon in his role as Chief Racing Manager of the GRA. 1996 saw the introduction of the Intertrack betting service, which enabled race-goers at other tracks around the country to view racing and place bets directly into the Wimbledon tote. In 1998 the Laurels relocated to sister track Belle Vue Stadium, and a new Paddock Bar extension costing £500,000 opened; the kennels were moved to the first bend to facilitate the change. The next year, Sky Sports screened their first greyhound meeting at Wimbledon, which included the Springbok final. The GRA switched the Grand National to Wimbledon from Hall Green in 1999.\n2000–2017.\nRapid Ranger completed two Derby successes in 2001, emulating Mick the Miller and Patricias Hope. Seamus Cahill and Bernie Doyle joined Wimbledon from Catford and Reading Stadium respectively in 2002. Catford closed in 2003, resulting in three new trainers, John Simpson, Tony Taylor and John Walsh. Catford Racing Manager Derek Hope took over from the departing Simon Harris, who left for Coventry. In 2003 Wimbledon underwent £70,000 in track improvements, following criticism received during the 2002 Derby. Consequently, the trip was changed to and the was changed to . Trainer Tommy Foster retired in 2004.\nWestmead Hawk won the 2005 and 2006 Greyhound Derby, becoming the fourth greyhound to attain two wins. Trainer Ray Peacock died in 2007, with racing Manager Derek Hope leaving to join William Hill, being replaced by Gary Matthews. In 2008 Richard Rees, son of Philip Rees Jnr., became a third-generation trainer at Wimbledon; Philip Rees Jnr retired due to ill health. Tony Morris, who stood as a track bookmaker, also retired after a long career at Wimbledon. In 2010 Wimbledon underwent major changes in time for the Derby; the grandstand was switched to the far side of the stadium, and the physical makeup of the track was altered, meaning new track records would be set. The changes cost around £400,000, which were partly funded by a £195,370 grant from the British Greyhound Racing Fund.\nThe GRA allowed the Grand National to go to Central Park Stadium in Sittingbourne in 2012, and leading trainer Norah McEllistrim left for Brighton &amp; Hove Greyhound Stadium. Bob Rowe switched to Belle Vue as the Racing Manager, along with the Oaks.\nAfter sharply falling attendances for many years, and with the stadium becoming dilapidated, its closure was announced by the GRA and the final meeting was held on 25 March 2017. This attracted a large crowd, many of whom were turned away due to reduced capacity restrictions, caused by much of the stadium being closed off for public safety. The last ever race was won by Glitzy King, trained by Brian Nicholls, who provided many of the dogs in the final few months of the stadium's existence.\nSpeedway.\nUntil 2005, the stadium was also home for over 50 years to the now defunct Wimbledon Dons speedway team. It was famous for hosting the Internationale meeting every season from 1962 until 1981, also hosting a qualifying round of this competition in 1961.\nSpeedway arrived at Wimbledon in the 1928 pioneer season, and a team was entered in the league competitions from 1929 to 1939. The team was re-formed after the war and the Dons raced in the top flight National League Division One from 1946 to 1964. The Dons were multiple winners of the league in the 1950s, and were founding members of the British League in 1965. From 1946, reopening after the war, average weekly attendances were in excess of 30,000, until the early 1950s, when the sport declined rapidly in popularity. However, Wimbledon remained one of the top teams, with healthy crowd figures, and upon the closure of Wembley in 1956 were the only team in London (excluding sporadic appearances by New Cross in 1959/1960 and 1963) until 1963 when Hackney entered the Provincial League, and 1964 when West Ham reopened in the National League (now known as the 1st Division Elite League).\nWimbledon's tenure in the top flight came to an end in the 1980s and the Greyhound Racing Association, the owners of the stadium at the time, decreed that speedway would end at the end of the 1986 season. However, David Pickles, a London stockbroker, gathered together a consortium in the 1986/87 close season that ensured that the Dons would continue to run. They employed the ex-England team manager John Berry, and enjoyed reasonable success on and off the track in their first season. After a disagreement with Berry and the other members of the board, Pickles dramatically resigned as chairman of the club during the match with Exeter in September 1987, selling his shares back to the other members. With a few reshuffles at board level and the leaving of Berry, the remaining members eventually took Wimbledon back to the British League Division One in 1991, but the move proved disastrous and with only a couple of months of the season having been ridden, the financial losses proved to be so great that they were forced to disband the team. In June 1991 Wimbledon rode their final meeting, which was eventually curtailed due to the weather. Although there was no longer any league racing at the Plough Lane stadium, the team continued their league fixtures for the 1991 season, moving to Eastbourne, and were known during this period as the Eastbourne Dons.\nHaving been defunct for eleven years, the team were then reopened again at Wimbledon Stadium in 2002, but were finally disbanded completely in 2005 as a result of a dispute between the team's promoters and the owners of the stadium, over a proposed large rent increase.\nStock car racing.\nPlough Lane also hosted Motor Racing events promoted by Spedeworth International, including Superstox, Stock Cars, Hot Rods and Bangers. The first stock car meeting at Wimbledon was on 29 September 1962 (the Superstox World Championship), and the circuit quickly became Spedeworth's flagship venue, with the World Final being held there every year up to and including 1974. The World Championship, along with other key race meetings such as Carnival Night, became very popular and were often 'ticket only' events filled to capacity. The stadium also boasted its own stock car racing teams in 1966 (London Sparrows) and 1971-72 (Canaries/Dons). The 1966 team shared its base with New Cross Stadium. The Unlimited Banger World Final also used to take place at Wimbledon until the event moved to Foxhall Stadium in 2008, citing the introduction of the London low emission zone as making it too expensive for the transporters to travel to the venue.\nOther notable events.\nWimbledon Stadium was the scene for part of the music video for the 1978 Queen song \"Bicycle Race\", in which 65 professional female models rode on bicycles (nude/partially-clothed) around the stadium.\nBanger racing at the stadium was featured in episode 12, series 1 of the 1970s ITV police series \"The Sweeney\", named \"Contact Breaker\".\nClosure and demolition.\nIn 2007 the stadium was purchased by development company Galliard Homes, when the Greyhound Racing Association was put up for sale (along with all of its assets) by parent company Wembley PLC. Following this, local professional football team AFC Wimbledon expressed interest in building their new football stadium on the site of the greyhound track. A joint planning application made by Galliard Homes and AFC Wimbledon to build the new football stadium, together with 600 residences, on the site of the greyhound stadium was approved by the London Borough of Merton in December 2015 despite the plans being in contravention of the \"London Plan\". Attempts to prevent the closure of the stadium failed; a £20 million rival planning bid to build a new greyhound stadium, submitted by Irish businessman Paschal Taggart, owner of Shelbourne Park Greyhound Stadium, and a bid by pressure group 'Save Wimbledon Stadium Action Group' to have the stadium granted listed status by Historic England both came to nothing. The stadium finally closed to the public on 25 March 2017, and demolition of the stadium and associated buildings commenced on 16 March 2018.\nCompetitions.\nWimbledon hosted the following competitions throughout its history.\nThe Derby\nSt Leger\nGrand National\nLaurels\nOaks\nPuppy Derby\nJuvenile\nChampion Hurdle\nCearns Invitation\nChampion Stakes\nDerby Consolation/Invitation\nThe International\nThe Key\nThe Key was a competition held from 1936 over the stayers distance and then the marathon distance.\n1936 -1957 (725 yards), 1936 -1975 (940 yards), 1975-1994 (868 metres)\nWimbledon Gold Cup\nThe Wimbledon Gold Cup was a competition held from 1929 originally over hurdles and later the stayers distance.\n1936 -1975 (500 yards hurdles), 1975-1982 (460 metres hurdles), 1986-1994 (660 metres)\nWimbledon Spring Cup\nThe Wimbledon Spring Cup also known as the Spring Stakes was a competition held from 1929 the standard distance and later the stayers distance.\n1929 -1959 (500 yards), 1936 -1975 (700 yards), 1975-1994 (660 metres)\nTwo-Year Old Produce Stakes\nThe Wimbledon Two-Year Old Produce Stakes was a competition held from 1935 until 1974.\nIn 1974 the track announced that the race would end blaming changing ties and increased expenses.\n1935 -1974 (500 yards)"

Cienfuegos did not play in the 1927–28 season, contending again from 1928 to 1929 through 1930–31. After eight long years of absence, Cienfuegos reappeared in the 1939–40 tournament. In the 1949–50 season, the team was renamed as the \"Elefantes de Cienfuegos\" (Cienfuegos Elephants). \"The pace of the elephant is slow but crushing\", exclaimed the slogan of the Cienfuegos franchise that contended until the 1960–61 season.

The body has approximately 100,000 registered members nationally in 1100 clubs across the country, which includes swimmers, coaches, officials, administrators and volunteers. The body oversees the management and development of the sport from the national team at the elite level, the conduct of national and international events, through to grass roots participation.\nIn 1985, the organisation had approximately 90,000 registered members.\nHistory.\nCompetitive national swimming championships were first held in 1894. Australia had swimmers at most major international swimming events since the 1896 Summer Olympics.\nThis interest led to the creation of the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia, the precursor to Swimming Australia, which was founded in 1909 at a meeting of state swimming representatives at the Sports Club on Hunter Street in Sydney's CBD. There they established a charter which included the key features of the promotion of uniformity of rules and regulations across Australia; the adjudication all matters of disputes between affiliated associations; the control and management of swimmers visiting Australia; the control and management of Australian representatives in any contest of international nature; and control the recognition of all \"best on record\" performances.\nWithin a short time the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia had extended its charter to include negotiation with the recently formed International Swimming Federation (Fédération Internationale de Natation, FINA).\nJames Taylor was the foundation president and served for the first 35 years of the body's existence from 1909 to 1944.\nDuring 1985, under a new corporate structure, the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia was incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory and became Australian Swimming Inc.\nOn 1 October 2004, Australian Swimming became a company limited by guarantee and changed its name to Swimming Australia Ltd. Glenn Tasker served as the chief executive officer until June 2008, and the organisation's headquarters is located at Unit 12, 7 Beissel Street, Belconnen, ACT. In 2013, Mark Anderson was appointed CEO.\nThe Australian Swim Team underwent a rebranding in 2014 and was renamed the Australian Dolphins Swimming Team.\nIn 2022, it established the Swimming Australia Hall of Fame.\nSwimming Australia supports and runs the Swimming Australia National Training Centre at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.\nAustralian Swimmers of the Year.\nSwimming Australia announces a number of awards annually, most notably the Australian Swimmer of the Year Award.\nStakeholders and affiliations.\nSwimming Australia's key stakeholders includes:\nSwimming Australia is affiliated to the following bodies:\nWhilst the following organisations are affiliated with Swimming Australia:\nSwimming Australia is also a foundation member of AUSTSWIM and is involved in the development of an Australian Water Safety Organisation.\nSexual abuse allegations.\nIn July 2014 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a Royal Commission of inquiry initiated in 2013 by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments, began an investigation into the responses of the Offices of the Directors of Public Prosecutions in Queensland and New South Wales to determine whether to prosecute allegations of child sexual assault; the response of Scone Swimming Club to the convictions of Stephen John Roser for indecent assault and for committing acts of indecency against a child; and related matters. Six former students, a number of swimming executives, government officials, Margaret Cunneen , Anthony Moynihan , Nicholas Cowdery , Lloyd Babb , The Honourable Justice Leanne Clare and Paul Rutledge gave evidence or made statements before the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission heard from women who alleged they had been abused as children and that despite informing officials, the alleged perpetrators did not face criminal trial on the basis of recommendations provided by government prosecutors in both New South Wales and Queensland. In April 2015 Swimming Australia president John Bertrand issued an apology to former swim students who were victims of sexual abuse.\nAllegations against various swimming coaches were reported as first aired in the media up to ten years earlier; and new cases were alleged following the Royal Commission hearings."

This is an annual rowing race between Amsterdam and Ouderkerk aan de Amstel Austel.\nHistory.\nWillem III Rowing Club was founded on 22 August 1882 by five friends: 15-year-old Arent Daniel Meyjes, his younger brother Gottfried and the brothers Egbert, Fije and Kees Bok. The boys were too young to join the existing rowing clubs, and therefore decided to start their own club. Their first base was the shipbuilding yard 'De Gouden Leeuw' the Meyjes brothers' father in the Kleine Kattenburgerstraat in Amsterdam. The fleet consisted of one (borrowed) sloop, the membership fee was 5-10 guildercent per week, and the annual budget amounted to 25 guilders. When naming their club after Willem III of the Netherlands, the boys did not realize that they needed permission from the monarch. They applied for this permission in 1885, which was granted on 18 December 1886 by the king.\nBoathouses.\nIn the following year the club and fleet grew, as a result of which the original boathouse became too small. The club moved to a new, larger, boathouse on the Hoogte Kadijk at the wharf 'Koning William'. Quickly, this housing became too small and in 1890 the club moved to a floating boathouse in the Oosterdok (opposite the current Maritime Museum. In 1896 the boathouse was moved to the river Amstel between the Govert Flinckstraat and the Stadhouderskade and in 1898 it was moved again to a spot close to the Amstelcanal. When Willem III existed 10 years it had 35 members and 60 supporters. By the turn of the century, the club had grown to 80 members and 77 supporters, and it owned 8 boats. In 1906, membership became open to women.\nTo handle the ongoing growth, a second floating boathouse was added in 1899. However, both boathouses were fragile. During a storm in 1903 one of the houses sank (and was lifted again) and in 1907 the other boathouse started to drift during a storm. To end these problems, the club started to construct a building close to the Amstel, opposite the Trompenburgstraat, which was opened in 1909. Because of the threat of war, the number of members dipped to 251 in January 1940, but subsequently growth picked up strongly, forcing the club to limit the number of members to 500. At the end of 1943, the Germans ordered the destruction of the housing of all rowing clubs on the banks of the Amstel, and in February 1944 the building on the Trompenburg was in fact demolished. Virtually the entire fleet was moved to an empty laundry in Nigtevecht. The members continued to gather in a rented room on the Ceintuurbaan.\nAfter the war, Willem III moved to the building of the 'Deutscher Turn und Rudernverein' (designed for 80 members) that it had to share with RIC. There was a pressing lack of space, which made it necessary to construct a new club house. In 1947 the general meeting decided to build a new club house at the current location. After solving the financial problems, construction could start in 1953, partly thanks to important contributions from the members themselves. The building was opened on 19 June 1954.\nRecent developments.\nThe building was expanded in 1996, doubling the boat storage, and adding a room for indoor row trainers. In 2000 and 2001 the change rooms were completely renovated and made accessible to handicapped people. In 2005 the renovation of the second floor, including the club room, was started. Willem III started 2006 with 800 members and supporters."

They may be translucent or opaque and are manufactured in many different colours. Balls from different manufacturers vary significantly in the way they perform contacting the club, flying through the air and rolling on the grass.\nTypes of Balls.\nPark golf balls are divided into three categories based on their construction.\nOne-piece balls are made of a single kind of plastic resin, shaped into a sphere and hardened. They are the most durable kind of ball but their performance is limited by the properties of the resin. These balls are also the cheapest and often available as rentals at park golf courses.\nTwo-piece balls have an inner core and outer covering made of different materials. By combining two materials, the advantages of both can be used in the same ball. For example, a ball may have a durable resin core, while the outer layer offers a better feeling to the player hitting the ball. In this way, the two-piece ball improves on the one-piece ball. However, due to the more complicated manufacturing process, they are also more expensive.\nThree-piece balls, sometimes called multi-layer balls, are constructed of several different resins and have a non-spherical core. They are difficult to produce and are designed to have a specific characteristic (such as the ability to curve in the air or stop quickly on the green). They are the most expensive balls on the market and currently only made by two companies, Mizuno and Asics.\nCommercial Balls.\nIn 2006, the following two- and three-piece ball were available on the market in Japan."

        "text": "The Skeleton tank also known as the Spider tank was an experimental prototype tank built in 1918 by the Pioneer Tractor Company, Winona, Minnesota for $15,000 ($ in ). The prototype was ready for trials by October 1918. Designed with several innovative features, some of which were controversial at the time, the Skeleton Tank project did not proceed beyond the single prototype.\nDesign.\nThe objective of this prototype was to develop a lightweight vehicle capable of crossing wide trenches in a manner similar to the then-conventional heavy British tanks. Unlike the British tanks with their fully enclosed chassis, the Skeleton Tank achieved the requisite lozenge shape by supporting its tracks with a skeleton-like framework formed from ordinary iron pipes joined by standard plumbing connections. Suspended between these track frames was an armored fighting compartment carrying a machine gun turret. The engines were also housed in this armor-protected box.\nThis arrangement dramatically reduced the weight of the vehicle as compared to the larger British and French tanks while preserving the trench-crossing capabilities of those machines, and there was a belief that most enemy bullets and cannon rounds would pass harmlessly through the structure. However, it eliminated the possibility of mounting weapons in sponsons as in the British tanks and thus limited the armament that could be carried.\nMotive power consisted of two Beaver four-cylinder engines with a final drive joining to a gearbox suspended between the rear horns of the tracks. This allowed a maximum speed of .\nSpecifications.\nThe Skeleton Tank weighed 9 tons and carried a boxy fighting compartment protected by a of armor, which was in line with the armor thicknesses on other Allied tanks.\nThe crew of two consisted of the driver and the commander/gunner who manned the .30 (7.62 mm) caliber machine gun in the turret.\nIt was long, which compared favorably in trench-crossing potential to the then-standard heavy British Mk IV and Mk V tanks with lengths of but weights of 28 to 29 tons, and the French Schneider CA1 and Char d'Assault St. Chamond with lengths of and and weights of 13.5 and 23 tons respectively.\nIt was wide, narrower than the to of the British tanks, and slightly higher at vice for the Mk IV/V due to its turret.\nIt was never ordered into production.\nSurvivor.\nThe cosmetically restored Skeleton Tank is preserved under a canopy at the United States Army Ordnance Museum at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.\nBibliography.\nNotes\nReferences "

The team had difficulty in arranging fixtures against the counties, and prior to the Test match in early September had played only four matches that are now rated as first-class (as well as many fixtures against weaker opposition), despite having already been in England for almost four months.\nThe Test was a late addition to the programme, being arranged at the instigation of the Surrey secretary, C. W. Alcock, who asked Lord Harris to put together a side. A. N. Hornby, Tom Emmett and George Ulyett refused to play, having unpleasant memories of the Sydney Riot of 1879, but Australia were also seriously handicapped, being without their star bowler, Fred Spofforth.\nThe Australians won 4, drew 3 and lost 2 of their first-class fixtures. Their only loss other than to England was to Nottinghamshire. That defeat was by only one wicket and came in a match in which they played a man short.\nAustralian tour party.\nThe Australian party consisted of: W.L. Murdoch (captain), A.C. Bannerman, J.McC. Blackham, G.J. Bonnor, H.F. Boyle, T.U. Groube, A.H. Jarvis, P.S. McDonnell, W.H. Moule, G.E. Palmer, J. Slight, F.R. Spofforth, G. Alexander (player-manager)."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1882",
        "text": "The Australia national cricket team toured England in 1882. The team is officially termed the Third Australians, following two previous tours in the 1878 and 1880 seasons. At the time, there was no Test cricket and so, as in 1880, the single match between England and Australia was rated first-class only. It has since been retrospectively recognised as a Test match. It also became historically famous as the match which created The Ashes.\nTest match.\nFirst day.\nMurdoch won the toss for Australia and chose to bat first. The decision proved a poor one though, as Australia were dismissed for 63 in 80 overs, taking just over two hours. The captain himself tried to offer resistance with a defensive 13, and the experienced Blackham top-scored with 17, but the only other batsman to reach double figures was Garrett with 10. Barlow and Peate took nine of the ten wickets between them, having received more assistance from the pitch than had been anticipated.\nBarlow and Grace opened for England but Grace was soon beaten by the pace of Spofforth and bowled for 4. A steady succession of wickets followed with only Ulyett (26 off 59 balls) and Read (19 off 54 balls) providing any real resistance. Spofforth collected 7 for 46 off 36.3 overs, including 18 maidens. Four of his seven dismissals were clean bowled. Despite Spofforth's excellent bowling, England had established a first-innings lead of 38, being all out for 101. Stumps were called at the end of England's first innings.\nSecond day.\nAustralia began their second innings. Openers Bannerman and Massie fared much better than in the first innings, putting on 66 for the first wicket — more than the whole team's total in the first innings. The loss of Massie triggered a mini-collapse with Australia losing 4 for 13 over the next few overs before Murdoch added a much-needed 29, but the last four wickets then fell for eight runs. Bannerman was top scorer with 55, and Australia were all out for 122 in 63 overs, an overall lead of 84.\nSome of the Australians were demoralised by their second-innings collapse but fast bowler Spofforth, enraged by some gamesmanship on the part of Grace, was determined to win. \"This thing can be done\", he is said to have declared. England had reached 15/0 before Spofforth made the first breakthrough, bowling Hornby for 9. He removed Barlow next ball, also clean bowled but Ulyett was able to prevent him achieving a hat-trick. Grace and Ulyett added of 36 for the third wicket until Spofforth had Ulyett caught behind by Blackham for 11. Grace fell two runs later, caught by Bannerman off Boyle for 32. England were then 53 for 4 but, with six wickets in hand and only 31 runs needed, they were still expected to win.\nEngland had reached 66 for 4 when Spofforth bowled a dramatic over. Lyttelton, having made a slow 12 from 55 deliveries, was bowled off the first ball and his middle stump was uprooted. Off the fourth ball, Spofforth caught and bowled Steel for a duck, and then bowled Read for another duck. The over was a three-wicket maiden which left England on 66 for 7. In Spofforth's next over, after he bowled Lucas for 5, England were 75 for 8, needing ten more runs for victory, but with only two wickets remaining. In the next over, Boyle removed Barnes for 2 and then, with the last ball, bowled Peate for 2. \nEngland were all out for 77 off 55 overs in 122 minutes, and Australia had won a sensational match by seven runs. Spofforth's match figures were 14 for 90. Contemporary accounts report that there was palpable tension among the spectators with the crowd steadily increasing throughout the day as news of the match spread. When Peate was out, the spectators were momentarily silent, but then they rushed onto the field to congratulate the Australians.\nMock obituaries and aftermath.\nEngland's astonishing collapse had shocked the English public, and the press savaged the players. It was the first time England had been beaten in England. On 31 August, in \"\", there appeared a now-obscure mock obituary:\nTwo days later, on 2 September, a second, more celebrated mock obituary, written by Reginald Brooks under the pseudonym \"Bloobs\", appeared in \"The Sporting Times\". It read as follows:\nIvo Bligh as captain of the England team which toured Australia in 1882–83, promised to regain \"those ashes\". He spoke of them again several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.\nIn the twenty years following Bligh's campaign, the term \"The Ashes\" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series—at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when George Giffen, in his memoirs (\"With Bat and Ball\", 1899), used the term as if it were well known.\nThe true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when Pelham Warner took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain \"the ashes\". As had been the case on Bligh's tour twenty years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term, and, this time, it stuck."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in England in 1884",
        "text": "The Australia national cricket team toured England in 1884. The team is officially termed the Fourth Australians, following three previous tours in the 1878, 1880 and 1882 seasons. The 1884 tour was a private venture by the thirteen players who each invested an agreed sum to provide funding, none of Australia's colonial cricket associations being involved. Billy Murdoch captained the team and George Alexander acted as player-manager. The Australians played a total of 32 matches in England, 31 of which have first-class status.\n1884 was the first English season to feature more than a single Test match. A three-match series was scheduled which included the inaugural Tests at both Old Trafford and Lord's. The third Test was played at the Oval which had staged the Tests in 1880 and 1882. England won the Test series 1–0 with an innings victory in the second Test at Lord's, while the first and third Tests were drawn. The 1884 series was the first Ashes series in England, following publication of the mock \"ashes\" obituary after the 1882 Test.\nThe tour was dogged by financial controversy with the Australians accused by the British press of being interested only in money. The allegations were refuted by the Australian press but it later became clear, when an England team arrived in Australia the following winter, that there had been a financial dispute between Alexander and the English team manager James Lillywhite, resulting in the two teams at first boycotting each other. The dispute was never evident while Murdoch's team was in England as they completed all their scheduled fixtures, winning eighteen matches and losing seven with seven drawn.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had a 13-man squad captained by Billy Murdoch while George Alexander was player-manager. Squad details below state the player's colonial team at the time, his age at the beginning of the tour, his batting hand and his type of bowling:\nThe 1884 squad was very similar to the 1882 squad with Alexander, Cooper, Midwinter and Scott replacing Tom Garrett, Tom Horan, Sammy Jones and Hugh Massie. Cooper and Scott were making their first visit to England.\nAustralia used the same eleven players in all three Tests, Scott making his debut in the first Test, and in the majority of their first-class matches as Alexander was effectively a reserve who made only five appearances on the tour and Cooper, who also made just five appearances, suffered a long-term injury. Cooper had an accident on the outbound voyage and tore ligaments in the spinning finger of his right hand.\nEngland Test selections.\nEngland selected a total of 16 players in the three Tests. Six players (Barlow, Grace, Peate, Shrewsbury, Steel and Ulyett) played in all three matches. O'Brien (first Test) and Christopherson (second Test) made their Test debuts. Hornby captained England in the first Test and Harris in the other two.\nDetails of the England players include their ages at the beginning of the 1884 season, their batting and bowling styles, and the county club they represented in 1884:\nTour preparations and voyages.\nThe Fourth Australian team was selected after Christmas 1883 at which time Victoria were playing New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in a match which ended on New Year's Eve with a three wicket win by Victoria. Another match was arranged to start on New Year's Day, also at the MCG, between the Fourth Australians and a Combined XI. All the tour selections except Spofforth were playing, though Scott played for the Combined XI. Murdoch scored a career-high 279 not out and McDonnell 111 in a total of 619, the result being a draw. A return match with the Combined XI was arranged in February at the Association Ground in Sydney. Scott played for the Fourth Australians, replacing Alexander, and Spofforth played for the Combined XI, the Fourth Australians winning by 9 wickets.\nUnlike other Australian touring teams, the 1884 team organised the project themselves and so it was a private business venture which involved none of the Australian colonial cricket associations. The players invested agreed sums to fund their travel and cover any losses.\nAfter one final match in Adelaide, which was the last time South Australia needed odds (i.e., extra men) to compete, the tourists left Melbourne on 11 March 1884 aboard the P &amp; O steamer \"Sutlej\" and arrived at Plymouth on 29 April. With a programme of 32 fixtures arranged, the first game in England began on 12 May at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and the last game against the South of England was completed on 12 September. The team travelled home on the SS \"Mirzapore\" and reached Melbourne again in early November. Murdoch enjoyed a shipboard romance on the return voyage with an heiress called Jemima Watson whom he married at Fitzroy, Victoria in December, only a few weeks after the \"Mirzapore\" berthed.\nThe outward bound voyage had a short stopover at Colombo where the Australians played a drawn game on Galle Face Green against a Ceylon XVIII in a one-day match on 1 April. The return voyage also stopped off in Colombo and the team played another odds match, again on Galle Face Green and drawn, on 23 October.\nTour itinerary.\nThe following is a list of the matches played by the Fourth Australians, all but one of which are first-class fixtures:\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nThis was the inaugural Old Trafford Test and, as Chris Harte described it, \"the first time that a match of such importance had been staged outside of London\". Selection of an England home Test team in the 19th century was the privilege of the host club and Lancashire selected five local players in their squad of twelve, although Jack Crossland missed out and was made twelfth man. Barlow, Hornby, Pilling and Steel all played as it was believed their presence would boost the gate receipts.\nChris Harte commented that the match was also the origin of Old Trafford's \"reputation for wet weather\", the game being drawn after rain had made the first day unplayable. The match was therefore reduced to two days play and it was reported that the wicket dried much quicker than expected and conditions were never difficult for batting. Even so, England were all out for 95 in their first innings, Boyle taking six wickets for 42 runs conceded (i.e., 6/42) with his medium-paced spin and Spofforth 4/42. Shrewsbury, displaying \"masterly technique\", scored 43 to save his team from real embarrassment. In their first innings, Australia \"hit with more vigour and confidence than their opponents\" and scored 182, a lead of 87. Their top scorer was Midwinter with 37. The wicket had dried out on the final day and England were able to bat out time and secure the draw, scoring 180 for the loss of 9 wickets (i.e., 180/9). Grace was top scorer with a patient 31 and Joey Palmer was the best of the Australian bowlers \"with his controlled off- and leg-cutters\".\nSecond Test.\nThis was the inaugural Lord's Test and England won by an innings after a century by A. G. Steel and fine bowling by Ted Peate and George Ulyett. The game ended just after lunch on the third day.\n\"Wisden\" recorded that the main elements of England's success were \"the magnificent batting of A. G. Steel and the bowling of Ulyett\". Batting first, Australia were reduced to 160/9 despite an innings of 63 by Giffen; but then Scott and Boyle added 69 for the final wicket, \"Wisden\" reporting that Scott played \"cool, confident, skilful cricket\" in an innings of 75. At close of play on the first day, England were 90/3 so the match was evenly poised, with Lucas on 28 and Shrewsbury on 27. Steel commenced his innings on the second morning and shared successful partnerships with Ulyett, Barlow and Lyttelton. While Steel was in, 261 runs were added and he made 148 including thirteen boundaries. It was the highest score made against the Australians during the season. By close of play, Australia had lost four wickets in their second innings for only 73 runs. Barlow later recorded that the score was 135/5 when he went out to join Steel and recalled Lord Harris, the England captain, saying to him: \"For Heaven's sake, Barlow, stop this rot!\" Barlow and Steel added 98 for the sixth wicket. Despite another good effort by Scott on the final day, Australia failed to avoid the innings defeat. Ulyett bowled very well but may have been helped by the state of the ground. However, Ulyett is best remembered in this match for taking what Pelham Warner called \"one of the historic catches of cricket\" when he caught and bowled Bonnor, noted for his powerful hitting. Warner recorded of Steel's innings that George Giffen talked about it most enthusiastically as late as 1911, when the two were in conversation at Adelaide. When Scott was dismissed for 75 in the Australian first innings, he was caught by his own captain Murdoch off the bowling of Steel. Murdoch was on as a substitute for an injured English player and this was the first time in Test cricket that a batsman was dismissed by a catch taken by a substitute fielder.\nSoon afterwards, the London press reported that the entire proceeds of the match, a sum of £1,334, had been awarded to the Australians. This had been agreed beforehand by Alexander and Harris to enable the tourists to cover their costs, but the press disapproved and accused the Australians of being mercenary and acting outside the spirit of the game. Harte commented on the extreme bias of the press as, in all their other games, the Australians received only a share of the gate money, \"an arrangement appreciated by the county clubs as the visitors' popularity always boosted takings\". In fact, Alexander had attempted to secure payment of half the whole gate (main stands and outer grounds) for every match but the counties refused to share main stand revenue. The agreement brokered by Lord Harris was for the Australians to receive half of all outer ground revenue plus the entire gate for the Lord's Test.\nThird Test.\nThe final Test at the Oval was played in hot weather and Murdoch created a then-record score of 211, the first double-century in Test cricket. Murdoch was helped by three missed chances off the bowling of Ulyett when he had made 46, 171 and 205. England followed on but had only lost two wickets when time ran out and the match was drawn.\nAfter McDonnell had made 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott completed the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: the first time in Test cricket that an entire team including the wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl. On this occasion, the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took a catch to dismiss Midwinter.\nThe two main features of England's first innings were Scotton's \"stonewalling\" and Read's (batting at number ten) \"hard and rapid hitting\". Scotton's 90 in six hours and Read's 117 in two enabled England to reach a respectable 346 but they still had to follow on, 205 runs behind. But the time taken by Scotton's innings left Australia with not enough time to bowl England out again and the result was a draw.\nThe Australian innings of 551 is still the Test match record for the highest total without a bowler conceding 100 runs (E Peate had an analysis of 2-99).\nOther matches.\nThe tour began well for the Australians with an innings victory in their opening match at Uckfield against a team chosen by Lord Sheffield which included W. G. Grace, George Ulyett, Billy Barnes, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. Although Fred Spofforth, Harry Boyle and Billy Midwinter were all playing, the Australian bowling was performed by George Giffen and Joey Palmer only, and they both took ten wickets in the match. However, the key performance in conditions that helped the bowling was Alick Bannerman's innings of 94 which alone outscored the Sheffield XI's first innings total of 86.\nThe Australians had mixed success in their next five matches, winning against Surrey and an All-England XI but losing to Oxford, MCC and the Gentlemen. An innings of 71 by Tup Scott in a low-scoring match was the key to defeating Surrey by 8 wickets. Centuries by Grace, A. G. Steel and Barnes gave MCC an innings victory at Lord's and Warner described this feat as \"remarkable\".\nThe next ten matches prior to the Old Trafford Test were played mainly in the north of England and the Australians did very well in this period, through June and into early July. They lost only to the North by an innings at Old Trafford when their batting struggled against Ted Peate and Ulyett while good scores by A. N. Hornby and Barnes ensured the North's victory. Giffen had a memorable game when the Australians played Lancashire at Old Trafford, taking a hat-trick in the Lancashire innings and then scoring 113. That match was drawn but the Australians defeated both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire by the same three-wicket margin. Spofforth, Palmer, Peate and Tom Emmett dominated the match at Bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total. At Trent Bridge, the bowling of Giffen and Palmer enabled the Australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win. In the return match against the Gentlemen at the Oval, the last three English batsmen including Lord Harris were all stumped by Jack Blackham.\nBetween the first and second Tests, the Australian victory over Middlesex, whose batting could not cope with Spofforth, was their only win in four matches at Lord's. The Australians struggled in a drawn game against Sussex for whom George Wyatt and Henry Phillips both scored centuries. Spofforth with 14 wickets and George Bonnor with an innings of 68 in a low-scoring match put the Australians back on track when they easily defeated a strong Players XI at the Oval.\nAn innings of 60 by Lord Harris helped Kent recover from a first innings deficit before the Australians, batting last, collapsed to lose by 96 runs at Canterbury. The first match against Gloucestershire was drawn, W. G. Grace scoring 116 not out for his county. The Australians won the second match convincingly with an innings total of 402 (Giffen 91, Billy Murdoch 89) before dismissing Gloucestershire for only 83. This began a good finish to the tour as the Australians won five of the last seven matches following the third Test. They twice defeated the South by an innings, Spofforth taking a total of 24 wickets in these two matches, but were again beaten by the North, for whom Dick Barlow scored a century and took ten wickets in the match.\nStatistical summary.\nMurdoch, Percy McDonnell and Giffen all scored 1,000 runs for the Australians in the 1884 season while Scott, Bannerman and Bonnor topped 900. Murdoch scored two centuries including his 211 at the Oval; Giffen, McDonnell and Scott one apiece. The outstanding bowler, as on previous tours, was Spofforth who took 205 wickets for the Australians at an average of 12.50 with a best performance of 8/62. Palmer took 130 wickets at 16.14 and the other main bowlers were Giffen (81 wickets) and Boyle (62). Midwinter took 15 wickets while the other players bowled occasionally only. Blackham was the wicket-keeper in 28 out of the 31 first-class matches, Murdoch standing in for him in the other three. Blackham held 23 catches and completed 16 stumpings. Eight fielders held more than twenty catches each, the most being Bonnor's 31.\nPutting the Australian performances into perspective, only eight Englishmen made 1,000 runs and only Harris scored more than Murdoch. Louis Hall with four completed the most centuries while Harris, Grace, Ulyett and Billy Bates made three apiece. Spofforth was easily the highest wicket-taker, beating the best English bowler Ted Peate by 70 while Palmer was third overall. Seven other Englishmen managed 100 wickets in the season.\nIn his history, Harry Altham wrote that the 1884 Australians have been equated with the 1882 team but he himself disagreed with that assessment. He added that George Giffen considered England's team in the final Test to have been the strongest of the nineteenth century.\nControversy and aftermath.\nAlthough there had been a prior agreement on the matter, bad feeling about the proceeds from the Lord's Test lingered and, at the end of their tour, the Fourth Australians faced more recriminations from the British press. Among other things, they were accused of \"introducing a bloodthirsty spirit\" and \"playing too obviously for money's sake\". This criticism was countered by \"The Australasian\" of 11 October, whose cricket writer Tom Horan, though himself no supporter of Murdoch's team, objected to the \"spiteful criticism from certain portions of the English press\" and pointed out the \"narrow-minded and insulting abuse levelled at the Australian cricketers\". In his history of Lord's, however, Warner stated that the Australians had \"evidently come into favour\" and that \"the rows and bickerings of the past were happily over and done with\".\nThe problems spilled over into the next Australian season when an English team formed by Alfred Shaw, James Lillywhite and Arthur Shrewsbury toured. A disagreement between Alexander and Lillywhite led to members of the Fourth Australians refusing to play against the tourists in certain matches and then being banned by the colonial authorities from playing in others. Having agreed contracts for matches with the colonial authorities, Lillywhite offered Alexander 30% of the gate receipts from the first two Tests, but Murdoch and the rest of the team insisted on 50%. One outcome was that Australia had to make eleven changes to their team for the second Test after terms could not be agreed with the Fourth Australians. The Fourth Australians had made up the team in the first Test but refused to play in the second Test in which nine debutants were necessary alongside Tom Horan and Sammy Jones.\nWhen the Fifth Australians toured England in 1886, the team was selected and managed by the Melbourne Club which was mindful of the past controversy. As a result, Murdoch, McDonnell and Bannerman were omitted despite still being leading batsmen. Boyle was unavailable, as were Horan and Massie who had toured in 1882, while Alexander, Cooper and Midwinter were no longer in contention for places. Scott was appointed captain and the other survivors of 1884 were Blackham, Bonnor, Giffen, Palmer and Spofforth."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team in England in 1888 played 37 first-class matches including three Tests. England won the series 2–1, after losing the first Test. The next time England would come back from one down to win a three match Test series at home was in July 2020, after they beat the West Indies 2–1.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nAustralian captain Percy McDonnell won the toss and chose to bat first. The visitors scored 116 runs in their innings, during which only Percy McDonnell, Jack Blackham and Test debutant Jack Edwards scored 20 runs or more. The English bowlers, led by Bobby Peel, who claimed four wickets and Johnny Briggs, who took three, ran through the Australian batting line-up. At the close of play on the opening day, England had scored eighteen runs for the loss of three wickets (18/3).\nResuming at 11.30 on day two, the score was lifted to 22, on which score England lost Walter Read, W. G. Grace (failing to add to his overnight ten), and Tim O'Brien. When Steel fell four runs later, England were seven wickets down and still eleven runs short of avoiding the follow-on. Thanks to Briggs, who top-scored for England with seventeen runs, the hosts managed to reach 53 from exactly fifty overs, after 55 minutes of play on the second day. The famous combination of John Ferris and Charlie Turner took eight of the wickets to fall, Turner picking up a five-for.\nWhen Ferris and Turner arrived at the wicket in Australia's second innings, they found their side on eighteen for seven, with Lohmann and Peel demolishing the top- and middle-order. Turner scored a dozen and Ferris twelve, but The Daily Telegraph remarked that \"it has to be said that never in the annals of cricket has such a fortunate innings as that of Ferris been compiled\".\nEngland needed 124 to win, but it managed to get only halfway. Of the home team's second innings of 62, Grace scored 24, \"far and away the best batting display of the match,\" said the \"Daily Telegraph\". Allan Steel, the captain, also chipped in with an unbeaten ten, but he was the only other batsman to reach double figures. Turner and Ferris claimed five wickets each, making for match figures of ten for 63 and eight for 45 respectively. The aforementioned newspaper, however, believed that Peel's first innings' four for 36 was a far better performance, as the wicket had been easier than at any other stage of the match.\nThis win was Australia's first over England since that at Sydney three years earlier. After that, the Antipodeans had been defeated on seven successive occasions. In the eight years since the 1880 visit, this was only Australia's second win in England, the other being the famous Test at the Oval in 1882."

        "text": "The Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is held once every four years. ODI cricket is one of three forms of cricket played at international level. Unlike Test cricket, ODIs consist of one innings per team and is played over the course of single day. Australia and England played in the inaugural ODI match on 5 January 1971 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The inaugural Cricket World Cup took place in England in 1975 and 12 tournaments have been held since. The first three editions were all held in England and each innings was limited to a maximum of 60 overs. Since the 1987 Cricket World Cup, all matches have consisted of 50 overs per innings.\nTop order batsman and former Australian captain Ricky Ponting holds several World Cup records. Playing in five tournaments between 1996 and 2011, he has played in more World Cup matches than any player with 46. He also holds the record for the most consecutive matches played. As a slip fielder, Ponting has also taken the most catches at the World Cup with 28. Captaining his side from 2003 to 2011, Ponting holds the World Cup record for the most matches played as captain with 29. India batsman Sachin Tendulkar has scored 2,278 runs making him the only player to score more than 2,000 runs at the World Cup. He has also scored the most World Cup half-centuries with 15 and shares the record with Pakistan's Javed Miandad for the most number of World Cup tournaments played with 6. \nAustralian fast bowler Glenn McGrath holds the record for the most World Cup wickets taken with 71, the record for the best figures taken in an World Cup with 7/15 and has the best bowling average at the Cricket World Cup with 18.19. Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara is the record holder for the most number dismissals and stumpings taken as a wicket-keeper at the World Cup with 54 and 13, respectively. The World Cup record for most catches as a wicket-keeper is held by Australian gloveman Adam Gilchrist with 45. Gilchrist and New Zealand's Tom Latham holds the record for the most dismissals in a single tournament by a designated wicket-keeper with 21.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, ties and no results and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records are correct of the 2023 Cricket World Cup.\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses, ties and no results.\nA total of 20 of the 29 ODI teams have played in at least one edition of the Cricket World Cup. The teams that have not played are the Africa XI, the ACC Asia XI, Hong Kong, the ICC World XI, Jersey, Nepal, Oman, Papua New Guinea and the United States. Six teams have played in all thirteen editions of the Cricket World Cup—Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The West Indies, who had played in every World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1975, failed to quality for the 2023 edition. Australia has played and won the most matches at the Cricket World Cup and has the highest winning percentage.\nTeam scoring records.\nHighest totals.\nThe highest innings total scored at the Cricket World Cup came in the group stage match between South Africa and Sri Lanka at the most recent edition in 2023. Playing at the Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium in Delhi, South Africa posted a total of 428/5. This broke the record of 417/6 set by Australia at WACA Ground in Perth against Afghanistan at the 2015 tournament. The third match of Group B in the 2007 World Cup saw India becoming the first team to break the 400-run barrier in a single innings at the World Cup. Playing against Bermuda at the Queen's Park Oval in the Port of Spain, India posted a score of 413/5. The 400-run mark has been passed on four other occasions in the World Cup.\nHighest successful run chases.\nPakistan claimed the highest successful run chase in Cricket World Cup history when they scored 345/4 chasing a target of 345 runs. This came during their group stage match against Sri Lanka at 2023 World Cup at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad. This bettered the previous record set at the 2011 World Cup where England set 328 runs for victory and Ireland reached the target with 5 balls to spare at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore.\nLowest totals.\nThe lowest innings total scored in World Cup came in the 2003 Pool B match at Boland Park in Paarl where Canada was bowled out by Sri Lanka for 36 runs. This broke the long standing record of 45 runs set at the 1979 World Cup where Canada was dismissed by tournament hosts England at Old Trafford. Both of these were ODI record scores at the time they were scored.\nHighest match aggregates.\nThe highest match aggregate in a World Cup match came in the 2023 Cricket World Cup group stage match at HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala where Australia and New Zealand combined to score 771 runs in the match. This broke the record of 754 runs set 21 days earlier in the same World Cup, between South Arica and Sri Lanka.\nResult records.\nAn ODI match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their innings. If both sides have completed their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher number of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by runs).\nThe greatest winning margin by runs at the World Cup was Australia's victory over the Netherlands at the Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium in Delhi at the most recently edition in 2023 where Australia won by a margin of 309 runs. This is followed by India's 302-run victory over Sri Lanka at the same tournament eight days later. Both of these eclipsed the previous record of Australia's defeat of Afghanistan during the 2015 World Cup by 275 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by 10 wickets).\nCricket World Cup matches have been won by a margin of 10 wickets on 12 occasions, the most recent being New Zealand's defeat of Sri Lanka in 2019.\nGreatest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThe group stage of the 1979 World Cup saw England run down the target of 46 runs to defeat Canada by a margin of 8 wickets with 277 balls remaining in the 60-over innings, the largest victory by balls remaining in ODI cricket history.

Both of these matches resulted in Australia defeating India. The first took place in the opening match of Pool A of the 1987 World Cup. The match was played at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, the same venue where the same two teams played out second tied Test a year earlier. The victory to Australia came on the second last ball of the match where Steve Waugh bowled Maninder Singh. The second match was four and a half years later at the 1992 World Cup where Australia was the hosting tournament. Played at the Gabba in Brisbane, this was the third match for both teams in group stage. The final ball of the rain affected second innings saw Steve Waugh run out Venkatapathy Raju to secure the win for the hosts.\nNarrowest win margins (by 1 wicket).\nSeventy ODI matches have been won by a margin of one wicket with seven of them occurring at the Cricket World Cup. The most recent occurred in 2023 at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Pakistan were bowled all out for 270 inside of 47 overs. In reply, South Africa made 206/4 before losing 46/5. However, tailender Keshav Maharaj struck the winning runs for the Proteas off the bowling of Mohammad Nawaz with 16 balls remaining.\nNarrowest win margins (by balls remaining).\nForty ODI matches have been won on the final ball of the match with one of them occurring at the Cricket World Cup.

On the final delivery of the match, the bowler Courtney Walsh saw Jaffar well out of his crease and could of dismissed him by run out but graciously decided to bowl the delivery again. Qadir scored winning runs and secured the victory.\nTied matches.\nA tie can occur when the scores of both teams are equal at the conclusion of play, provided that the side batting last has completed their innings. , there have been 43 matches that have ended in a tie in ODI cricket history, with five occurring at the Cricket World Cup. The first came in the second semi-final of 1999 World Cup at Edgbaston where South Africa's Allan Donald got run out on the third last ball of the match. Due to Australia finishing ahead of South Africa at the end of the Super Six stage with the superior net run rate, Australia advanced to the final. There they defeated Pakistan by eight wickets. The next three which took place in 2003, 2007 and 2011 respectively all occurred in the group stage with the teams sharing the points. The most recent tied match came in the 2019 Cricket World Cup final where both England and New Zealand finished their innings on 241 runs. For the first time in ODI cricket history a Super Over was used as a tie-breaker. The teams were still unable to be split after the Super Oval as both teams scored 15 runs so a boundary countback was invoked. With England having scored more boundaries in both the main game and the Super Over, 26 to 17, they were declared the winner and the World Cup champions.\nIndividual records.\nBatting records.\nMost runs.\nA run is the basic means of scoring in cricket. A run is scored when the batsman hits the ball with his bat and with his partner runs the length of of the pitch.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs at the Cricket World Cup with 2,278.

A further eight players have an batting strike rate of above 100.\nMost half-centuries.\nA half-century is a score of between 50 and 99 runs. Statistically, once a batsman's score reaches 100, it is no longer considered a half-century but a century.\nSachin Tendulkar of India has scored the most half-centuries at the Cricket World Cup with 15. He is followed by India's Virat Kohli on 12 and in third with 11 fifties to his name, Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan.\nMost centuries.\nA century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings.\nIndia's Rohit Sharma has scored the most centuries in the Cricket World Cup with seven.

A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nSri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara has taken the most dismissals in ODI cricket as a designated wicket-keeper with 482. He narrowly sits ahead of the Australia gloveman Adam Gilchrist with 472 ODI career dismissals.

Since then Pakistan's Sarfaraz Ahmed and Quinton de Kock of South Africa also achieved the milestone at the 2015 and 2023 World Cups respectively. A further nine wicket-keepers have taken five dismissals in a World Cup innings.\nMost dismissals in a single tournament.\nAustralian Adam Gilchrist set the record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in the Cricket World Cup at the 2003 edition with 21.

A fair catch is defined as a fielder catching the ball, from a legal delivery, fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nFormer Australian captain Ricky Ponting holds the record for the most catches at the Cricket World Cup by a non-wicket-keeper with 28.

He broke Ricky Ponting of Australia's long standing record of 11 set at the 2003 World Cup in the second semi final against Australia and secured his 13th of the tournament in the final against New Zealand. The latest edition of the World Cup in 2023 saw New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell also take 11 catches to draw even with Ponting.\nOther records.\nMost matches.\nRicky Ponting of Australia holds the record for the most matches played at the Cricket World Cup with 46. India's Sachin Tendulkar despite playing in one more tournament than Ponting is in second on 45.\nMost tournaments.\nPakistan's Javed Miandad made an appearance in every Cricket World Cup from the inaugural edition in 1975 through to 1996, playing total of 33 matches across 6 tournaments. The feat was matched by India's Sachin Tendulkar who played 45 matches from 1992 to 2011. A further 18 players have appeared in five World Cups with the Bangladeshi pairing of Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim the latest to do so in 2023.\nMost consecutive matches.\nThe most capped World Cup player, Australia's Ricky Ponting, also holds the record for the most consecutive matches played. Missing only the opening pool match against Sri Lanka at the 1996 World Cup due to the forfeit over security concerns in Colombo, Ponting went on to play in all of Australia's next 46 matches. He is followed his compatriot Glenn McGrath with 39 straight matches from 1996 to 2007. India's Sachin Tendulkar only missed one World Cup match in his career, the group stage match against Zimbabwe in 1999. His father died and he flew home to India for the funeral.

Stephen Fleming, who skippered New Zealand from 1999 to 2007 is second with 27 matches. India's captain from 1992 to 1999, Mohammad Azharuddin, is third on the list with 23.\nYoungest players.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest to appear at the Cricket World Cup was Nitish Kumar who, at the age of 16 years and 283 days, played in Canada's second group stage match at the 2011 tournament against Zimbabwe eclipsing the record that Bangladesh's Talha Jubair had set at the 2003 World Cup playing against the West Indies at 17 years and 70 days old.\nOldest players.\nThe Netherlands' fifth and final match in the 1996 Cricket World Cup saw Nolan Clarke set the record for the oldest player to appear in an ODI match at 47 years and 257 days. This broke the World Cup record set at the previous tournament where John Traicos representing Zimbabwe played in their final group stage match against England at the age of 44 years and 306 days.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nThree ODI cricket partnership records have been set at the World Cup. West Indians Marlon Samuels and Chris Gayle for the second wicket, the South African pairing of David Miller and JP Duminy for the fifth wicket and most recently Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins set the eighth wicket ODI partnership record against Afghanistan at the 2023 tournament. The oldest World Cup partnership records are for the ninth and tenth wicket where both were set at the 1983 tournament.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe. This broke the previous highest partnership set at the World Cup where Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid came together to score 318 in India's defeat of Sri Lanka at the 1999 tournament. This was also an ODI record at the time of posting. These are the only two partnership totals greater than 300 runs to be achieved at the World Cup.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nDavid Shepherd of England holds the record for the most Cricket World Cup matches umpired with 46. He sits narrowly ahead of the West Indies' Steve Bucknor on 45 and Pakistan's Aleem Dar who has officiated in 34 matches from 2003 to 2019."

        "text": "Samuel Thomas Bowen (born September 18, 1952) is an American former outfielder in Major League Baseball who played between 1977 and 1980 for the Boston Red Sox. He batted and threw right-handed. In a three-season career, Bowen posted a .136 batting average (3-for-22) with one home run, one RBI, three runs, and one stolen base in 16 games played.\nAmateur career.\nWith very few opportunities at the major league level, Bowen was not able to fulfill his real potential after a solid career at Valdosta State University.

        "text": "Henry Tefft Clarke, Jr. (August 4, 1875 – March 28, 1950) was an American baseball player and coach, lawyer and politician. He played Major League Baseball pitcher for the Cleveland Spiders in 1897 and the Chicago Orphans in 1898. He was also a coach for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He later served as a Nebraska state legislator and railroad commissioner.\nEarly years.\nClarke was born in August 1875 at Bellevue, Nebraska. His father, Henry T. Clarke, Sr., was a well-known merchant who served in the Nebraska territorial legislature. Clarke was educated in the public school at Bellevue until 1882. He attended the public schools in Omaha, Nebraska from 1882 to 1892. He graduated from Omaha High School in 1892 as the class valedictorian. He was brother to fellow player, coach Maurice Gordon Clarke.\nWilliams College.\nIn 1892, Clarke enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts and played on the college's varsity baseball team. In 1893, he made his debut in a victory over the Yale Law School. \"The New York Times\" reported: \"Williams had a new pitcher, Clarke, '96 during the first half of the game. He did creditably but showed lack of experience.\" A later article made note of Clarke's pitching skills as a sophomore in 1894: \"He will be remembered by Eastern college men for good work in the box his sophomore year at Williams College, when he gave Lewis a close rub for the position of 'Varsity pitcher.'\" In May 1894, \"The New York Times\" reported that Clarke had been \"fairly effective,\" except in the first inning, and hit a \"beautiful home run\" in a loss to Harvard.\nUniversity of Chicago.\nIn the fall of 1894, he transferred to the University of Chicago. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1896 and remained there for a year of post-graduate work. He played for Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons football team in 1895 and 1896, and also played for the Stagg's Chicago Maroons baseball team in 1895, 1896 and 1897. He was the captain of Chicago's 1897 baseball team. Chicago's baseball team compiled records of 15-5, 19-11, and 17-4 during the three years Clarke was a player. In a review of the 1897 baseball season, \"Outing\" magazine wrote: \"Henry Clarke, their captain, has proved himself an able leader and is head and shoulders above every other pitcher in this section.\" The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" gave much of the credit for Chicago's 1897 record to Clarke: \"The largest element in the success of the institution by the Midway was the phenomenal pitching of Henry Clarke. If victory can be accredited to any one man that man was Clarke last year.\"\nWhile attending the University of Chicago, Clarke was also president of his class, president of the glee club, and a member of the Lion's Head and the O. &amp; S. senior honorary society.\nMajor League Baseball.\nIn May 1897, Clarke won a tryout with the Boston Beaneaters. The \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" reported that, during Clarke's tryout, Boston manager Frank Selee had been remarked that Clarke had \"good speed, an excellent change of pace, combined with curves that kept the Boston men guessing.\" Clarke signed instead with the Cleveland Spiders, joining a pitching staff that included Cy Young. Between June 26 and August 2, 1897, Clarke appeared in five games for Cleveland, compiling a record of 0 wins and 4 losses and an earned run average of 5.87. Clarke also appeared in two games as an outfielder in 1897 and compiled a batting average of .280.\nClarke also briefly returned to Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Chicago Orphans in 1898. He appeared in only one game as a pitcher for Chicago, a 5-4 victory over the Cleveland Spiders. His 1898 record was 1-0 with a 2.00 earned run average.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nClarke enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School in the fall of 1897. He received his law degree from Michigan in June 1899. While attending law school, he served as the assistant coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1898 and the head coach in 1899. In February 1899, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" wrote:\nNext to the presence of a lot of new player the question of having a good all round coach is important. There will be no doubt on that score this year ad the management has hired Henry Clarke, the famous ex-Chicago pitcher, who for the past two years has been a student in the law department here and was last year assistant coach of the baseball team. . ... He brings to the duties of his advanced position a knowledge of the game in all its departments, a long schooling on the best college teams, and a valuable experience in National League company. His aid to the battery candidates will be invaluable and as he was regarded as Chicago's crack batsman for two years his development of Michigan's comparatively weak stick work will be watched with interest.\nIn addition to his position as head coach, Clarke also appeared as a player in several of Michigan's games in 1899. In mid-April 1899, the Wolverines played two games against Milwaukee, a professional baseball team from the Western League. After Michigan gave up seven runs in the second game, Clarke came into the game as a pitcher and pitched the final six innings. He held the Milwaukee team scoreless for two innings, but he gave up eight runs in the sixth inning, two in the seventh and one in the eighth. Michigan lost the game 18-1.\nClarke also appeared in two games against the Hamilton Club of Chicago in May 1899. Michigan won both games by scores of 4-3 and 6-1. During Clarke's two seasons as a baseball coach, the team compiled records of 15-6 and 14-5 and finished 2nd and 1st in the Western Conference.\nClarke was also the coach of Michigan's all-freshman football team in 1898.\nLegal and political career.\nIn the fall of 1899, Clarke was admitted to the Illinois bar and joined the Chicago law firm of Church, McMurdy &amp; Sherman.\nClarke returned to Nebraska in 1900 and established a law partnership with Frank Crawford, a classmate from the University of Michigan who also served as Michigan's first football coach in 1891. They practiced law together as Crawford &amp; Clarke from 1900 to 1905.\nIn 1904, Clarke was elected as a Republican to the Nebraska House of Representatives. He was reelected to the same office in 1906. Clarke was the sponsor of a child labor bill that passed the Nebraska legislature and was signed into law in 1907. He was also active in the passage of a pure food law.\nIn March 1907, Clarke was appointed as a Nebraska railroad commissioner by Governor George L. Sheldon, following a vacancy on the commission. He was elected to the position in a special election in the fall of 1907. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1910.\nClarke worked from at least 1918 to 1920 as a traffic manager and attorney for the Omaha Grain Exchange.\nClarke was a member of the Masons, the Elks, the Royal Arcanum, the Omaha Club, the Fontanelle Club, the Omaha Commercial Club, the Lincoln Commercial Club, the Lincoln Country Club and the Episcopal church.\nFamily and later years.\nClarke was the son of Henry T. Clarke Sr. and Martha A. Fielding Clarke.\nClarke married in September 1901 to Grace Louise Allen. They had three children, Allen Gordon Clarke, William Cleveland Clarke and Henry T. Clarke III.\nClarke spent the last year of his life at the Emory John Brady Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He reportedly suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died in Colorado Springs in March 1950 at age 74."

They currently play in the Leinster Senior League, and in the past had first-class status, and played against several sides that were touring England, including the Australians (twice), South Africans (three times) and West Indians (as late as 1923).\nHistory.\nTheir first first-class matches came in 1895 when they played home and away matches against Cambridge University, also playing at home against the MCC and away against Leicestershire. They would not play first-class cricket again until 1922 when they played Essex and four times against Northamptonshire between 1924 and 1926. The two games in 1926 are their final first-class games to date. The team for two of those games against Northamptonshire featured the Irish writer Samuel Beckett.\nThe club has produced more than 150 players for Ireland, the most prominent probably being Ed Joyce, who played fifty times for Ireland before going on to represent England.

Listed at , , Brown batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Beeville, Texas.\nBrown spent 30 years in professional baseball, including 12 major league seasons, but is best remembered as the pitcher who delivered the most home runs to Lou Gehrig, 15, including two grand slams.

Spencer was a 3-year starter playing nose guard and fullback. At fullback, he dominated in the backfield and ran for more than 600 yards, averaging a solid 9.1 yards per carry. By the time Spencer was through, he ended his high school career by setting team records in tackles and sacks.

Spencer started all 16 regular season games for the Cowboys in 2009, starting at outside linebacker opposite teammate DeMarcus Ware.\nWhile Dallas was able to win their first playoff game in over a decade, the Cowboys fell to the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. Spencer pitched in two tackles and a sack in the Wild Card game against Philadelphia, and had an outstanding game against the Vikings in the Divisional Round, recording 10 tackles and a sack in a 34-3 Dallas loss.\n2010 season.\nSpencer followed up his 2009 season with a very solid 2010 season, as he again started all sixteen games. For the first time in Spencer's Dallas career, the team finished with a losing record, at 6–10 (the Cowboys were 13–3 in 2007, 9–7 in 2008, and 11–5 in 2009).

He missed all of the preseason after a surgical procedure that at the time was said to be for a bone bruise on his left knee. He came back to play against the Kansas City Chiefs registering 2 tackles and one quarterback hurry. After experiencing pain in his knee following the game, he underwent season-ending microfracture surgery.\n2014 season.\nAfter remaining a free agent for over a month, Spencer re-signed with the Cowboys with a one-year deal on April 26. Recovering from career threatening knee surgery, there were questions of how much he would play in 2014. His recovery ramped up at the end of training camp and was able to come back for the fourth game against the New Orleans Saints.\nHe was solid against the run and steadily improved as a pass rusher, finishing with 17 quarterback pressures (tied for fourth on the team). In the playoffs against the Detroit Lions he played a season-high 40 snaps and finished the game with 3 tackles, one sack and forced a fumble in the fourth quarter that would have ended the game, had DeMarcus Lawrence not fumbled the ball while returning it.

        "text": "Matthew Erickson Moore (born August 9, 1984) is a former American football quarterback. He was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2007, and also played for the Carolina Panthers, Kansas City Chiefs, and Miami Dolphins. He played college football at UCLA and Oregon State.\nEarly years.\nAfter playing youth football for six years with Palmdale Falcons Youth Football, Moore attended William S.

He was slated to redshirt, but was pressed into duty due to injuries to Cory Paus and Drew Olson against Cal. He appeared in six games as a true freshman, becoming the first Bruins' true-freshman quarterback to start since Cade McNown. The Bruins defeated Stanford in Moore's debut, making him the first true-freshman QB in his first game to lead UCLA to victory. He led the team to seven scoring drives against the Cardinal. He saw action against Arizona, USC, Washington State, and New Mexico in the Las Vegas Bowl as a reserve. Moore was 7 for 11 for 64 yards and one touchdown in the annual rivalry game against USC. For the season he completed 33 of 62 passes for 412 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n2003.\nMoore started four of the eight games he appeared in at UCLA. He threw for 555 yards, two touchdowns, and six interceptions as a sophomore, completing 52 of 103 passes. He started the season opener against Colorado, but suffered a leg injury that sidelined him for the next three games. He had difficulty regaining the starting job with just eight pass attempts over the next three games. He moved back in front of Olson on the depth chart for the Oct 26 game at the Rose Bowl against Arizona State, passing for 190 yards and a touchdown in UCLA's 20–13 win. He also started the team's next two games against Stanford and Washington State.\nAt the end of the season, Moore transferred from UCLA. (LA Times, December 5, 2003).\n2004.\nMoore did not play in 2004 while attending the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, California. Although he had not played baseball since high school, he was selected in the 22nd round of the 2004 MLB draft by the Los Angeles Angels after scouts saw him play in a Southern California semi-pro baseball league and invited him to private workouts with the team.\n2005.\nAlthough he also strongly considered Colorado State, Moore enrolled at Oregon State in January 2005 and participated in spring training with the team. Head coach Mike Riley announced him as the leader on the depth chart entering the 2005 season. He finished the season with 2,711 yards passing, the ninth-highest total for a single season at OSU. His .594 completion percentage was third among the 20-best single season yardage performances in school history. Moore injured his right knee in the second quarter of the 10th game of the season against Stanford and missed the remainder of the year. His 271.1 yards passing per game was second in the Pac-10, trailing only USC's Matt Leinart (293.5). Making yet another record-breaking debut, he threw for 367 yards in the season opener against Portland State, the most ever by a Beaver quarterback in his first start. Moore threw for a career-high 436 yards against Arizona, had 317 yards at Louisville, and 311 against Arizona State. He hit Mike Hass on a 63-yard touchdown strike against Washington State that gave OSU the lead 37–33 after the team trailed 30–13 late in the second quarter. He also had two 58-yard passes—one to Anthony Wheat-Brown in the team's upset of No. 18 California in Berkeley and the other one week later (again to Hass) in his return to the Rose Bowl.\n2006.\nMoore started all 14 games for the Beavers and was an All-Pac-10 honorable mention leading the Beavers to a 10-win season capped off by a Sun Bowl victory against Mizzou. After a 2–3 start, Moore and coach Mike Riley received a great deal of criticism from fans. Both found redemption after winning the next 8 of 9 games. This streak included a win over #3 ranked USC and a Civil War win at home. On the season, Moore completed 229 of 378 passes for 3,022 yards and 18 touchdowns with seven interceptions. He set an Oregon State record for the most consecutive pass attempts without an interception with 183 before having that streak end in the Sun Bowl. He was named MVP of the Sun Bowl after throwing for 356 yards and four touchdowns and rushing for one touchdown. The 4 passing TDs were a Sun Bowl record. It was the second-highest scoring game in the Sun Bowl's 73-year history. He was 5-for-7 for 55 yards on the winning drive, setting up a 2-point conversion to put the Beavers up 39–38 with 22 seconds left to play.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nMoore was not selected in the 2007 NFL Draft, but he was courted by the Dallas Cowboys and the Carolina Panthers, among other teams. Eventually, Moore signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys. On signing with Dallas, Moore stated, \"They had two quarterbacks on the roster; it was the Cowboys,\" adding \"seemed like an easy choice to me at the time.\"\nDuring the preseason, Moore completed 21 of 29 pass attempts for 182 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, while also logging a 100.1 quarterback rating. On September 1, the Cowboys waived Moore during their final preseason cuts. The Cowboys intended to sign Moore to their practice squad had he passed through waivers. However, the following day, he was claimed off waivers by the Panthers.\nCarolina Panthers.\n2007 season.\nAfter being signed by the Panthers, Moore was listed as the third-string quarterback behind veterans Jake Delhomme and David Carr. Delhomme suffered a strained right elbow injury, early in the season, during a game against the Atlanta Falcons. Moore saw his first regular season action on October 7, 2007, against the Saints, during the Panthers' . Near the end of the first quarter, Moore entered the game after Carr suffered a back injury, due to a sack. Moore's first NFL completion was a 43-yard pass to Keary Colbert; his playing time was brief as Carr returned to the field for the game's second half. The following day, Delhomme determined it would be best to undergo season-ending ligament-replacement surgery for his elbow injury. As a result of Delhomme's season-ending surgery and Carr's back injury, the Panthers signed veteran quarterback Vinny Testaverde to their roster.\nMoore later briefly relieved Carr towards the end of a against the Tennessee Titans. Moore also entered the Panthers' week 12 loss to the Saints, after Carr's ineffective performance. A balky back kept Testaverde from starting this game, and the Panthers' head coach John Fox stated that if healthy enough, Testaverde would start the next game over both Carr and Moore.\nAfter six brief appearances during the season, Moore started his first NFL game on December 16, 2007, against the Seattle Seahawks; Testaverde was ruled unable to play, because of \"general soreness.\" He led the Panthers to victory against the Seahawks while completing 19 of 27 passes for 208 yards without a turnover. The following week, the Panthers suffered a loss against the Cowboys, while Moore had 15 completions on 28 pass attempts for 182 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. During the game, Steve Smith hauled in Moore's first NFL touchdown pass. The Panthers ended the season with a road win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which Moore completed 15 of 24 pass attempts for 174 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. After these performances, Moore was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month for December. Overall, in the 2007 season, Moore finished with 730 passing yards, three touchdowns, and five interceptions.\n2008 season.\nMoore played in all four 2008 preseason games for the Panthers; during the final preseason game against the Steelers, Moore injured his leg. Moore was cleared to practice as two x-rays and an MRI revealed no broken bones. However, during a practice, Moore injured his leg, and an x-ray revealed a broken fibula. The Panthers' general manager Marty Hurney initially stated Moore would not be placed on injured reserve. Despite this, Moore was sidelined the entire 2008 season, and even spent the last 12 weeks of the season listed as inactive.\n2009 season.\nMoore saw his first action of the 2009 season when backup quarterback Josh McCown was injured during the Panthers' week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Moore finished with 63 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Moore also played briefly against the Arizona Cardinals, attempting one pass which was incomplete.\nAfter starter Jake Delhomme broke his finger in a week 12 loss to the New York Jets, Moore started against the Buccaneers on December 6, 2009, the following week. He completed 14 of 20 passes for 161 yards and an interception, en route to a 16–6 Panthers' victory. The following week, he completed 15 of 30 passes for 197 yards and a touchdown in a 20–10 loss to the New England Patriots.\nOn December 20 (in his 6th start) Moore had the best game of his career when he led the Panthers to a 26–7 upset victory over the Minnesota Vikings. In the victory he completed 21 of 33 passes for 299 yards, 3 touchdowns, and 0 interceptions, and improved to a career 4–2 as a starter. He drew praise from head coach John Fox and top receiver Steve Smith, who caught nine passes from Moore for 157 yards and a score.\nOn December 27 Moore completed 15 passes on 20 attempts for 171 yards, and for the second week in a row, three touchdowns and no interceptions, as Carolina beat the New York Giants 41–9. Moore had a career-high 139.8 passer rating. The victory came during the final game to be played in Giants Stadium and essentially eliminated the Giants from the playoffs. The Giants' home loss was their worst since 1998. Moore again drew praise from analysts, including Tony Dungy who said that Moore \"looked liked a pro-bowler\".\nMoore started the last game of the Panthers' season on January 3, 2010, as the Panthers beat the Saints 23–10. The Saints, who were the No. 1 seed in the NFC, were handed their third loss of the season as they rested most of their starters. The game was the coldest home game in team history for the Panthers. Moore completed 14 passes on 23 attempts for 162 yards and a touchdown. The win improved the Panthers to .500 with an 8–8 record (4–1 while starting Moore) to finish the season.\nIn his five games as a starter for the 2009 season, Moore threw eight touchdown passes with one interception. The strong finish by Moore and the Panthers, combined with earlier poor play by Jake Delhomme, led to speculation that Moore would challenge, if not replace, Jake Delhomme's role as the starting quarterback for the 2010 season despite Delhomme's large contract. This turned out be the case as Delhomme was cut from the Panthers on March 4, 2010.\n2010 season.\nMoore was declared the starter for the 2010 season after Delhomme's release. Despite this, the Carolina Panthers drafted rookie Jimmy Clausen with their second round pick (48th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. Though Moore had clearly established himself as the Panthers' number one quarterback, he faced pressure for the starting job from Clausen, possibly resulting in his poor play throughout the rest of the season. Moore suffered a concussion during the season opener at the New York Giants, and he was benched the following week in a loss against the Buccaneers following poor play. On September 20, 2010, Moore was removed as the Panthers' starting quarterback in favor of rookie Jimmy Clausen, after throwing four interceptions in the first two games.\nAfter sitting out for three straight games, Moore was again declared the Panthers' starting quarterback on October 18, 2010, following poor play by Clausen. In his first game back as a starter against the San Francisco 49ers, Moore completed 28 passes on 41 attempts for 308 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, setting career highs in yards and completions.\nIn a week 9 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Moore injured his shoulder after a hit from Sedrick Ellis. He was placed on injured reserve by the Panthers, ending his season.\nMiami Dolphins.\n2011 season.\nMoore was signed by the Dolphins on July 28, 2011, to back up Chad Henne. He switched numbers, from 3 to 8. On October 2, 2011, Moore entered the game against the San Diego Chargers in the first quarter after Henne went down with a shoulder injury. He completed 17 of 26 passes for 167 yards and an interception, compiling a 67.3 quarterback rating. On November 6 he became the first Miami quarterback since Chad Pennington in 2008 to throw three touchdown passes in a game, in their 31–3 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Chiefs. He repeated that feat in week 11, blowing out the Bills 35–8, and had the highest QB rating of the week. Following the season, he was announced as the Dolphins' 2011 season MVP. Overall, Moore finished the 2011 season with 2,497 yards, 16 touchdowns, and nine interceptions.\n2012 season.\nDuring the offseason, Moore was battling for the starting quarterback role against newly drafted Ryan Tannehill and newly signed David Garrard. Moore became the second-string quarterback. On November 28, 2012, in a week 8 game against the Jets, Moore went in for Tannehill after he left the game with injuries to his left knee and thigh. Moore went 11 for 19 on his passes with a touchdown, leading to a 30–9 victory over the Jets.\n2013 season.\nOn March 8, 2013, Moore re-signed with the Dolphins, agreeing on a two-year deal to remain a backup for Tannehill. He did not see much action in the 2013 season. His lone appearance came against the Buffalo Bills, where he was 2-of-6 for 53 yards and two interceptions in a 19–0 loss.\n2014 season.\nIn the 2014 season, Moore saw action in two games. On September 28, against the Oakland Raiders, he came into the end of the 38–14 victory in relief of Ryan Tannehill. On November 2, he was 2-of-4 for 21 yards in the 37–0 victory over the Chargers.\n2015 season.\nIn the 2015 season, he only appeared in one game. In the 44–26 victory over the Houston Texans, he completed one pass for 14 yards and ran out the clock at the end of the game in relief of Tannehill.\n2016 season.\nOn March 15, 2016, Moore re-signed with the Dolphins, agreeing on a two-year deal worth $3.5 million to remain a backup for Tannehill.\nOn December 11, 2016, during a week 14 game against the Cardinals, Moore saw his first action as quarterback for the season. He replaced Tannehill in the fourth quarter, after Tannehill was injured on a low hit by Cardinals' defensive end Calais Campbell. The injury would later be confirmed as a sprained left MCL and ACL. Moore led a game-winning field goal drive, highlighted by Moore's 29-yard pass to wide receiver Kenny Stills deep in the final quarter to put the Dolphins on the 3-yard line. After a couple of plays, Dolphins' kicker Andrew Franks kicked a 21-yard field goal in heavy rain to win the game 26–23, keeping the Dolphins' playoff hopes alive. He started the next game against the Jets, completing 12 of 18 passes for 236 yards and a career-high four touchdowns with one interception as the Dolphins beats the Jets by a score of 34–13, improving their record to 9–5 and clinching their first winning season since 2008. It was Moore's first start since 2011. With his performance, Moore was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.\nMoore was announced the starting quarterback for the Dolphins against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the of the 2017 National Football League playoffs as Tannehill did not appear to be fully recovered. This was Moore's first playoff game. The Dolphins lost 30–12 to the Steelers in Pittsburgh.\n2017 season.\nDuring week 7 against the Jets, Moore entered the game after Jay Cutler suffered a chest injury in the third quarter. Moore finished with 188 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Dolphins won by a score of 31–28. Due to Cutler's injury, Moore started the week 8 game against the Baltimore Ravens, throwing for 176 yards and 2 interceptions as the Dolphins lost by a score of 40–0. Both of his interceptions were returned for touchdowns. During the week 11 game against the Buccaneers, Cutler took a hit to the head on the final play of the first half and was relieved by Moore, who threw for 282 yards and 1 touchdown as the Dolphins lost by a score of 30–20. Due to Cutler being in the concussion protocol, Moore started the team's next game and finished with 215 passing yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions in the 35–17 loss.\nKansas City Chiefs.\n2019 season.\nMoore spent the 2018 season out of football, though he did receive offers to play. In 2019, he worked as a scout for the Miami Dolphins during the draft process. He had started working as an assistant coach for a high school football team when he signed with the Chiefs on August 26, 2019, following an injury to backup quarterback Chad Henne.\nMoore took over as the Chiefs' quarterback after Patrick Mahomes injured his knee on October 17, 2019, in a week 7 game on \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Denver Broncos.

        "title": "2007 Australian Open – Women's singles",
        "text": "Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova in the final, 6–1, 6–2 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2007 Australian Open. It was her third Australian Open singles title and her eighth major singles title overall. Ranked as the world No. 81, she became the first unseeded player to win the title since Christine O'Neil in 1978.\nAmélie Mauresmo was the defending champion, but lost to Lucie Šafářová in the fourth round.\nThis marked the final Australian Open singles appearance for three-time champion Martina Hingis, who lost in the quarterfinals to Kim Clijsters.\nDaily review.\nDay 1: 15 January.\nThe First day of play at Melbourne Park saw defending champion Amélie Mauresmo advance in straight sets to the second round, along with a string of Russian top-10 players (Kuznetsova, Petrova, Dementieva, among others). US Open semifinalist and Auckland champion Jelena Janković also sailed through in straight sets, but rising teen Nicole Vaidišová had to survive a tough three set challenge from Jill Craybas to advance. 2005 and 2003 champion Serena Williams showed glimpses of the form that saw her rise to World No.1 when she swept past 27th seed Mara Santangelo 6–2 6–1 despite a relatively poor service percentage of 45%.\nDay 2: 16 January.\nThe second day was ravaged by heat in excess of 40 deg Celsius (104 deg Fahrenheit) causing the Extreme Heat Policy to be implemented. Many matches were delayed due and play continued merely on the two roofed courts. Maria Sharapova was playing in Rod Laver Arena, but before the Extreme Heat Policy came in use. As a result, the roof could not yet be closed and the match had to be played in full heat. She was particularly distressed during the match squandering a 1–0 lead in sets and a 5–0 lead in the decisive set, but eventually defeated Camille Pin 6–3, 4–6, 9–7, who was two points away from victory serving for the match at 7–6. Fourth seed Kim Clijsters, on the other hand, advanced soundly in twelve straight games 6–0 6–0, defeating Hobart finalist Vasilisa Bardina. Three time winner and six time finalist Martina Hingis also swept through with little difficulty, losing only two games to 2005 semifinalist Nathalie Dechy. Ana Ivanovic lost as many games to Vania King to advance to the second Round. The only seeds to fall were Eleni Daniilidou of Greece who fell 4–6 0–6 to Aiko Nakamura, and Flavia Pennetta, who lost to 2006 Hasselt finalist Kaia Kanepi of Estonia in straight sets. Former World No. 8, Australian wildcard Alicia Molik also advanced. 12 first round matches, including those of Patty Schnyder and Dinara Safina were postponed until Wednesday.\nSeeded Players Out: Flavia Pennetta, Eleni Daniilidou\nDay 3: 17 January.\nThe third day's rain delays did not affect the woman's draw. Minor upsets of seeded players No. 14 Francesca Schiavone, No. 18 Marion Bartoli, and No. 23 Ai Sugiyama were at the hands of Lucie Šafářová, Victoria Azarenka, and Anastasiya Yakimova respectively. No. 2 Amélie Mauresmo advanced soundly 6–2, 6–2 against Olga Puchkova, as did No. 5 Nadia Petrova against Gisela Dulko 6–1, 6–2. Fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced 6–2, 6–1. Former World Number One, Serena Williams, advanced 7–6(4), 6–2 for the right to play Petrova in round three. At the end of Wednesday there were three American women remaining in the draw: Williams, Ashley Harkleroad and Laura Granville. Other seeded women to win were: No. 7 Elena Dementieva, No. 10 Nicole Vaidišová, No. 11 Jelena Janković, No. 16 Shahar Pe'er, No. 20 Tatiana Golovin, No. 21 Katarina Srebotnik, and No. 26 Maria Kirilenko. Unseeded Maria Elena Camerin of Italy and Czech Eva Birnerová also advanced to the third round.\nDay 4: 18 January.\nLighter rains than the previous day were experienced resulting in minimal delays. Women's Number One, Maria Sharapova advanced soundly over fellow Russian Anastasia Rodionova, 6–0, 6–3. Number 4 seed, Belgian Kim Clijsters also advanced in straight sets over Akiko Morigami, 6–3. 6–0. No. 6 Martina Hingis, No. 8 Patty Schnyder, No. 9 Dinara Safina, No. 19 Li Na, No. 22 Vera Zvonareva, No. 29 Alona Bondarenko, and No.30 Tathiana Garbin all passed their second round tests in straight sets as well. Other seeded women #12 Anna Chakvetadze, #13 Ana Ivanovic, and #15 Daniela Hantuchová required three sets to advances to the third round. Crowd favourite, Aussie Alicia Molik, clawed her way into the third round against Kaia Kanepi after being down one set, 1–6, 6–3, 6–2. The only seeded Australian woman in the draw, Samantha Stosur, on the other hand, fell to Croat Jelena Kostanić Tošić, 6–4, 2–6, 6–2. Young American Ashley Harkleroad upset number 17 Anna-Lena Grönefeld of Germany, 6–2, 6–2. Her compatriot Laura Granville was beaten by 12th seeded Anna Chakvetadze. Unseeded Japanese player Aiko Nakamura also advanced, defeating Indian Sania Mirza, 6–3, 6–2.\nDay 5: 19 January.\nAmélie Mauresmo advanced in straight sets, 6–3, 6–1 over Czech Eva Birnerová to advance to the fourth round. She would move on to face Lucie Šafářová who won after only one set when opponent Anastasiya Yakimova had to retire. Former World Number One Serena Williams survived a miserable first set to defeat number 5 fiery Russian Nadia Petrova 1–6, 7–5, 6–3. Also advancing to be Serena's opponent was Serbian upstart Jelena Janković who won her match against Belarusian Victoria Azarenka soundly 6–3, 6–4. Number 3 Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced in straight sets over fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko 6–1, 6–4. Her opponent in the fourth round would be #16 Israeli Shahar Pe'er who survived a scare against #20 Tatiana Golovin being down a set to win 3–6, 7–5, 7–5 in one of the best matches on Day 5. Also advancing were number 7 Elena Dementieva and number 10 Nicole Vaidišová who won their matches in straight sets against unseeded Maria Elena Camerin and number 21 Katarina Srebotnik, respectively.\nDay 6: 20 January.\nNumber one Maria Sharapova continued easily moving through the draw after surviving her Day 2 scare due to heat. She defeated 30 seed Tathiana Garbin 6–3, 6–1. Her opponent in the fourth round would be fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva, who surprisingly defeated number 13 Ana Ivanovic soundly 6–1, 6–2. Australian fan favourite Alicia Molik won her first set 6–3 against Swiss Patty Schnyder on Rod Laver Arena, but could not continue her pace, as Schnyder won 3–6, 6–2, 6–0. Number 4 Kim Clijsters defeated Alona Bondarenko 6–3, 6–3 in a quick match. Number 6 Martina Hingis continued the great play of her comeback, winning 6–2, 6–1 against Aiko Nakamura. Clijsters, Hingis, and Schnyder will all benefit from playing on the roofed courts during the rain experienced on Day 6, as their opponents on Day 8 will have to play on Day 7 as well. The matches delayed by rain were: #9 Dinara Safina v #16 Li Na, #12 Anna Chakvetadze v Jelena Kostanić Tošić, and #15 Daniela Hantuchová v Ashley Harkleroad. The winners of those matches would play Hingis, Schnyder, and Clijsters, respectively. The roofed centre courts are always seen as an unfair advantage to the top players or the home country players, as they are able to complete matches on days affected by rain or heat, whereas their opponents are delayed and face playing on back-to-back days.\nDay 7: 21 January.\nDay 7 saw five seeded players defeated by their opponents. Unseeded Lucie Šafářová advanced to the quarterfinals courtesy of a 6–4, 6–3 surprising upset of defending champion and number two seed Amélie Mauresmo. Her opponent in the next round will be tenth-seed Nicole Vaidišová who posted a 6–3, 6–3 upset of seventh-seed Elena Dementieva. Rising star Israeli Shahar Pe'er caused another upset by winning a 6–4, 6–2 over third-seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova to become the first Israeli woman to make a major quarter-final. Her opponent in the quarterfinals will be Serena Williams, who is enjoying her current role as a loose cannon, defeating eleventh-seed Jelena Janković in a 6–3, 6–2 win. The last remaining Asian representative, nineteenth-seed Li Na, won in a 6–2, 6–2 decision over ninth-seed Dinara Safina to advance to the fourth round. Twelfth-seed Anna Chakvetadze won against Croat Jelena Kostanić Tošić 6–4, 6–4. The young Ashley Harkleroad nearly caused another upset but failed to, with fifteenth-seed Daniela Hantuchová winning the match 6–7, 7–5, 6–3. The Li, Chakvetadze, and Hantuchová matches were delayed from day 6.\nDay 8: 22 January.\nThe other four fourth round matches all took the court on the eighth day, with three of the top eight seeds in play advancing. Top seed Maria Sharapova was pushed to two close sets by fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva but eventually prevailed 7–5, 6–4. Fourth-seeded Belgian Kim Clijsters beat Daniela Hantuchová, who was playing for the second day in a row 6–1 7–5 to advance to the quarterfinals, where she was drawn to face Martina Hingis, who needed three sets to battle past the number one ranked Chinese player Li Na after being a set down. She won 4–6, 6–3, 6–0. The final match of the day was the only women's match to be played on Melbourne Arena, with the others all being on Rod Laver Arena. There the twelfth-seeded Russian Anna Chakvetadze pulled off a surprisingly easy 6–4, 6–1 victory over former semi-finalist Patty Schnyder of Switzerland to advance to her first ever Grand Slam quarterfinal, and would next meet Sharapova.\nDay 9: 23 January.\nThe bottom half quarter-final line-up was scheduled to play today, with only two women's singles matches taking the court. The first pitted seven-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams against Shahar Pe'er of Israel. The unseeded Williams lost the first set 6–3 but grew in confidence in the second set to take it 6–2 and push it to a deciding set. Pe'er looked on-form for victory when she went up 6–5 in the final set, and just a few points from her first major semi-final, but it was Williams who then showed her fighting spirit by winning the next three games to wrap up the 3–6, 6–2, 8–6 victory and become one of the ten lowest-ranked women in the Open Era to compete in a Grand Slam semi-final.\nThe other quarter-final followed after with Nicole Vaidišová beating compatriot Lucie Šafářová 6–1, 6–4 to make her second major semi-final after the 2006 French Open. Vaidišová completely overpowered her fellow Czech in the first set, needing just thirty minutes to take it and compiling a 14–4 winner to unforced error ratio. Although Šafářová gave more of a battle in the second set, Vaidišová was still too good for her and managed to close out the one hour eleven-minute match with ease. In the semi-finals she will face Serena Williams, the first meeting between the pair.\nDay 10: 24 January.\nTop-seeded Maria Sharapova opened up play as the remaining four players in the top half of the draw took to the court. She was drawn to face another Russian Anna Chakvetadze. Sharapova showed her fighting spirit early on in the first set, coming back from 4–2 and 5–3 deficits to bring things to a first set tie-break, where she again fell behind at 5–3, before winning the last four points to take the first set 7–6(5). In the second set, Sharapova took several break point opportunities in the second set, before letting Chakvetadze back into the match but eventually she made it through to the semi-finals with a 7–6(5), 7–5 victory.\nTaking to the court after was Belgian Kim Clijsters and Swiss Martina Hingis in the last quarter-final to be contested, and one of the most anticipated match-ups thus far in the tournament. Last year, Clijsters beat Hingis at exactly the same stage before losing to Amélie Mauresmo. The fourth-seed squandered the first set, making 23 unforced errors, but began to find her game in the second set. She raced to a 5–2 lead in the second set, but let it slip before eventually winning 6–4 to push it to a deciding set. Hingis raced off to an early 2–0 lead in the last set, but all energy had been drained from her and she lost six of the last seven games of the match to hand Clijsters the victory, despite having forty-two unforced errors less than the Belgian. The semi-finals will feature Maria Sharapova against Kim Clijsters.\nDay 11: 25 January.\nBoth semi-finals were on the schedule on Day 11, with Serena Williams against Nicole Vaidišová first to take the court. Vaidišová broke early on for a 2–0 lead, but she squandered that advantage. At 5–4, the Czech had a chance to serve out the first set and take the advantage, but Williams fought back to take it to a tie-break and take the first set. In the second set, Williams continued to dominate moving ahead 5–1 and just points from wrapping up the victory, but it was Vaidišová who showed her fighting spirit saving four match points at 5–3 to Williams and then saving another in the last game of the match before Williams finally wrapped up the 7–6(5), 6–4 victory by converting her sixth match point and reach her first Grand Slam final since her Australian Open win two years previously.\nImmediately after, it was decided that she would face Maria Sharapova in the final, after the Russian ended the Australian Open career of Kim Clijsters, who is set to retire at the end of the season with a 6–4, 6–2 victory. The two broke each other constantly in the first set, with Clijsters eventually having the advantage at 4–3, before Sharapova reeled off six consecutive games to go up a set and 3–0. She held onto her serve for the rest of the match and broke once more in the last game to take the match and move into her third Grand Slam final.\nDay 13: 27 January.\nThe women's final was scheduled to be played on the Saturday, with two of the biggest stars on the WTA Tour in Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams set to face each other. The fans who expected a tough battle were eventually disappointed though, as Williams dominated the top-seeded Russian from start to finish. Her game was completely on form throughout the match, with Sharapova only managing to hold service once in the first set as Williams hit winner after winner. The second set was no different, although Sharapova managed to hold twice in the last set but Williams was too good and prevailed 6–1, 6–2 to win her eighth Grand Slam title and her third Australian Open title. At the trophy presentation, Williams dedicated her win to Yetunde Price, her elder half-sister who was shot in September 2003. Williams became the third-lowest-ranked major titlist since 1975, after Evonne Goolagong and Chris O'Neil who won here in 1977 and 1978 respectively."

        "title": "Statis Pro Baseball",
        "text": "Statis Pro Baseball was a strategic baseball simulation board game. It was created by Jim Barnes in 1970, named after a daily newspaper column he wrote for an Iowa morning newspaper, and published by Avalon Hill in 1978, and new player cards were made for each new season until 1992. A licensing dispute with Major League Baseball led Avalon Hill to cease production of new cards. The game, however, came with instructions for players to create their own cards, so each year many people produce their own player cards, and some even sell them online.\nDue to the nature of the gameplay, the game was suitable for both solitary and head-to-head play.\nGame set.\nThe game set included player cards for most Major League players from the previous season, for all of the Major League Baseball teams, with position players and pitchers receiving different types of cards. In earlier sets, National League pitchers were assigned two cards—one for pitching and one for hitting—but this was changed by 1988, when each team was assigned a single card representing all its pitchers.\nThe set also included a rectangular game board, which resembled a baseball diamond. Around the diamond were arrayed spots to place the stack of cards for the batters and pitchers for each team. There were also several cards which allowed results from bunting, base stealing, extra bases, etc. to be determined (see below).\nTo facilitate play, a large deck of 98 cards with random results was used. These were called Fast Action Cards (FACs), and were used instead of dice, which many similar games utilized. Each card had four results—two per side, one right-side up, one upside-down—which increased the possible number of results. The random numbers utilized an octal (base 8) system (using 1–8) and ran from 11 to 88, excluding numbers ending in 9 or 0 (i.e., 11–18, 21–28 ... 81–88), for a total of 64 numbers. The cards also contained further information used for gameplay (as detailed below).\nAdditionally, the game included \"out\" sheets to enable the player to determine how outs were made during a particular at-bat (see below for more detail). Finally, tracking play was done with scorecards, similar to those used to track the results of a real Major League game, but with additional spaces for information necessary for the game.\nPlayer cards.\nBatter cards contained the following information:\nIn addition, each batter would have ranges for the following results (proportionate to the batter's likelihood of achieving each result):\nPitcher cards contained the following information:\nIn addition, each pitcher would have ranges for the following results (proportionate to the pitcher's likelihood of achieving each result):\nOriginally the game was played with a set of dice and a yellow cardboard square which had result numbers 11–88 as well as results for clutch hitting, pitching, and defense arranged in a circle within the square. A metal spinner was affixed to the center of the square. Play was incorporated by rolling the dice to get a number between 2–12 which would determine if the play result would come from the pitchers card or the batters card. Then the spinner would be spun and the resulting number or other occurrence would give the play result.\nBasic gameplay.\nMuch like a real game, a game of Statis Pro Baseball would begin by choosing teams, pitchers, and line-ups. This could be done with two players, each managing a different team, or with one player managing both. In order to simulate a real season, each player card indicated which positions a players was allowed to play, and for how many games during a full season (e.g., a card might indicate a player could play 100 games at shortstop, 30 games at third base, and 10 games at catcher; similarly, a pitcher might indicate 10 games as a starter, and 25 as a reliever).\nEach at-bat was simulated the same way. First, a Fast Action Card (FAC) would be drawn to determine a PB number, from 2 to 12. This would be compared to the PB rating on the pitcher's card, which ranged from 2–5 for bad pitchers to 2–9 for great pitchers. If the PB number was \"in range\", a new FAC would be drawn, and the random number would be compared to the pitcher's card to determine the result of the at-bat. If the PB number was \"out of range\", the resulting random number would be compared to the batter's card to determine the result.\nFor example, suppose a PB 2–9 pitcher is in the game, and that the PB number drawn is 6. This is \"in range\" (that is, between 2 and 9). Next, a random number is drawn—assume that number is 41. Looking at the hypothetical pitcher's card, we see that 41 is a strikeout. Thus, the at-bat is complete. If, however, the original PB number drawn was 10, it would be \"out of range\" and the random number would be compared to the batter's card. For this hypothetical batter, 41 is a home run. Using this example, it can be seen that the results depend a lot on whether the PB is \"in\" or \"out\" of range—simulating whether the pitcher or the batter controls that at-bat. Thus, 2–9 pitchers will be more effective because they control more at-bats than 2–5 pitchers.\nMost of the results of any given PB and Random Number draw will be obvious to those who know baseball—1B, 2B, 3B, HR, K, BB are all familiar from boxscores. If, however, the random number falls into the Out range on either the batter or pitcher card, another FAC must be drawn to determine the type of out. Matching the CHT code with the FAC, the type of out could be determined. The outs used standard baseball scorekeeping (1=Pitcher, 2=Catcher ... 9=Right fielder), matched with codes unique to Statis Pro. These codes were then matched with the out charts to determine the exact result, based on number and position of the runners on base. The codes were as follows (using shortstop as an example):\nFinally, if the code had an asterisk next to it, a final FAC would be drawn to check for error. This was done by comparing the error range on the FAC to the error rating of the fielder. For example, if the fielder's error rating was E2 and the error rating on the FAC was F8 to F10, then there would be no error.\nClutch play.\nIn order to simulate \"clutch\" play, every player was assigned rating for BD (clutch hitting) and CD (clutch defense). These situations would be initiated by PB numbers on cards reading either BD or CD.\nBD would only apply if runners were on base. In that case, a second FAC would be drawn for the Random Number. For pre-1988 cards, each batter was assigned a BD rating of 0, 1, or 2. The BD rating plus the Random Number would be compared to the BD Chart on the game board, possibly resulting in an extra-base hit. For 1988 and later, each batter had a unique BD rating on his card—the Random Number would be compared to the card, and the Chart could be ignored. If the Random Number fell outside the hit range on either the Chart or the card, play would resume with a new PB number.\nIf CD was drawn as the PB number, a second FAC would be drawn to determine the position involved. Next, a third FAC would be drawn for a Random Number. Using the CD rating of position player (pre-1988, CD0 through CD2; 1988 and later, CD1 through CD4) and the Random Number, the CD chart would be consulted to determine the outcome of the play.\nUnusual plays.\nVery occasionally, a PB number of Z would be drawn. Z indicated an unusual play, and would result in drawing of a second FAC for the Random Number, and then consulting the Unusual Play Chart. Random Numbers of 11–44 covered unusual plays such as ejections, catcher interference, rainouts, etc. Numbers 44–78 covered unlikely defensive plays, such as triple plays (although many were applicable only if specific combinations of runners were on base). Finally, numbers 81–88 indicated that an injury had occurred. This led to the drawing of another Random Number to determine the result of the play and who was injured. Then, using another Random Number matched with the player's INJ rating, the number of games to be missed could be determined (the fewer games missed in real-life, the fewer games missed in the simulation).\nAdvanced gameplay.\nThough an entire game could be played as described above, Statis Pro had a number of advanced features to simulate managerial/coaching decisions such as bunting, base-stealing, hitting-and-running, taking extra bases, playing the infield in, etc. In most cases, these would be done by the manager of the hitting team announcing a decision before the draw of a PB number for a new batter.\nIn order to steal a base, for example, the manager would announce which runner was stealing. A FAC would be drawn, and the resulting Random Number would be compared to the base-stealing chart on the game board. The results varied based on whether the runner was stealing second, third, or home. Depending on the draw, it might be necessary to consult the runner's SP (base-stealing) rating.\nTo sacrifice bunt, the process would be the same as for stealing, except that the sacrifice bunting chart would be used. The results would depend on the Random Number and the batter's Sac (sacrifice bunting) rating.\nFrom the pitching side, in order to simulate fatigue, every pitcher would be assigned a two Reduction Ratings (one for starting, one for relief). Each time the pitcher surrendered a hit, walk, run, wild pitch, or hit batsman, his rating would be reduced by one point (e.g., a walk and then a home run would be 4 points - one each for the walk and the hit, and then two for the runs scored). Once a pitcher's Reduction Rating reached zero, a PB number would no longer be drawn for each hitter—instead, all at-bats would begin with a FAC Random Number draw being compared to the hitter's card. Because of this, it was usually advisable to remove a pitcher once his reduction hit zero (or even before).\nOnline community.\nSince Avalon Hill ceased production, many players have resorted to creating their own player cards, using the formulas provided in the game instructions. Some have even created new FACs to make the Random Number and PB Number draws more truly random. Others have created new rules in order to add further realism to the game (such as rules for foul balls, special rules for different ballparks, etc.)."

        "title": "Northern Cape (cricket team)",
        "text": "Northern Cape (formerly Griqualand West) is a first-class cricket team that nominally represents the South African province of Northern Cape in the CSA Provincial Competitions. The team is selected and supported by Northern Cape Cricket and plays its home games at the De Beers Diamond Oval in Kimberley.\nAt organisational level, Northern Cape Cricket is responsible for the administration and development of cricket in the province and among its primary functions are management and promotion of the Northern Cape team. Originally founded sometime before 1884 as the Kimberley Cricket Club, the organization developed at provincial level as the Griqualand West Cricket Board until 2015 when it was renamed Northern Cape Cricket to comply with a government directive that provincial sporting bodies should have their governance structure aligned with the geo-political structure of the country.\nThe team was called Kimberley to 1890–91 and Griqualand West to 2014–15. It has been called Northern Cape from the beginning of the 2015–16 season. For the purposes of the SuperSport (now Sunfoil) Series, Griqualand West merged with Free State to form the VKB Knights (originally the Diamond Eagles) from October 2004, but Griqualand West (renamed Northern Cape in 2015) has retained its independent status as a team in the CSA Provincial Competitions.\nTeam history.\nBeginning as Kimberley Cricket Club, the team is first recorded in the 1884–85 season playing in the Champion Bat Tournament. In 1888–89, they won two odds matches against the English touring team known then as R. G. Warton's XI. As a result of those victories, Kimberley were awarded the new Currie Cup as the most accomplished domestic team in South Africa. In the 1889–90 season, they were successfully challenged for the trophy by Transvaal but they recovered it in 1890–91. The first matches as Griqualand West were played in December 1890 for the Champion Bat Tournament and, from 1891–92, the team was known by its provincial name only.\nIn 1897, the Barnato Memorial Trophy was given to the Griqualand West Coloured Cricket Board, a union for all black cricket players that had been set up in 1892. Griqualand West participated in the first Barnato Tournament in 1898–99, along with Eastern Province, Queenstown, Southern Border, and Western Province. In 1904, Griqualand West was one of the three founding members of the South African Coloured Cricket Board (SACCB). In total, there were thirteen editions of the SACCB-run Barnato Cup tournaments, which were played between 1904 and 1951–52. Griqualand West won the competition in 1910 and hosted it in 1904 and 1913.\nIn 2004–05, the format of the Sunfoil (then SuperSport) Series was changed, with the reduction of eleven provincial teams into six franchises. After missing the first season of the franchise tournament due to a legal dispute, Griqualand West partnered Free State to create the then Diamond Eagles who were renamed VKB Knights ahead of the 2010–11 season. Just before the beginning of the 2015–16 season it was announced that the organisation was to be renamed Northern Cape Cricket, in line with the national government directive that provincial sporting bodies should have their governance structure aligned with the geo-political structure of the country.\nVenues.\nVenues have included:\nSquad.\nIn April 2021, Cricket South Africa confirmed the following squad ahead of the 2021–22 season."

His brother Andrew, was also a rugby union centre and has played for the Wales national rugby union team. In 2003, Bishop represented Wales at under–21 level.\nBishop began his professional career in the 2003–04 Celtic League, playing for the Celtic Warriors.\nHe joined the Ospreys in 2004 after the disbandment of the Celtic Warriors, scoring a try on his debut against Munster. In September 2005 suffered a serious knee injury in a game against Munster. At the time, Bishop had recently been called into the training squad for the Wales by head coach Mike Ruddock. This injury kept Bishop out of competitive rugby for nearly three years, first returning to play for Bridgend Ravens in 2007, before making his competitive return to the Ospreys in September 2008, against Glasgow. Bishop was released by the Ospreys at the end of the 2008–09 season, making six appearances following his return from injury, and 22 in total for the club.\nFollowing his release, Bishop joined Sale Sharks on a one year contract. He departed the club at the conclusion of the season.\nIn August 2010 he joined Newport Gwent Dragons on a two month trial. He made his first appearance in a preseason friendly against London Irish and came off the bench in the first match of the season against Connacht. Bishop ultimately did not sign a longer term contract, and subsequently joined Edinburgh on a short term deal.\nFollowing the completion of his contract at Edinburgh, Bishop joined Birmingham Moseley in January 2011. In June 2011, Bishop signed with Neath RFC, but shortly after joined National League One team Jersey, prior to the beginning of the season.\nDuring his first season with Jersey, Bishop helped the club gain promotion to the RFU Championship, their fourth promotion in five seasons. Jersey maintained their position in the Championship throughout Bishop's time with the club, narrowly avoiding relegation in 2014. Bishop retired at the end of the 2014–15 season, and served as club captain on numerous occasions."

It is the oldest in the country, having been formed in 1863, and is headquartered at 31 Maitland Crescent, Colombo 7, close to the headquarters of Sri Lanka Cricket.\nHistory.\nThe idea of a gentlemen's team for British colonists in Ceylon was first mooted among the patrons of the Colombo Club- a social club for the British upper class then located at the Galle Face Green (not to be confused with the 1871 club of the same name and location). The beginnings of the club proper can then be traced back to a notice in the Colombo Journal of 5 September 1832, which called for \"\"...gentlemen who may be inclined towards forming a Cricket Club...\" to \"...meet at the Library (located in the Pettah) at 2 o'clock precisely on the 8th instant\"\". Sources then differ as to the exact date of the formation of the club, some citing 8 September, October, or November of the same year, with all sources agreeing that a cricket club was formed sometime in 1832. The newly formed club was located in Slave Island, on the land that later became the Rifle Green (now the site of the Defence Services School). The first officially recorded game of cricket in the country was that between the eventual CCC and a team fielded by the 97th Regiment of the British Army stationed in Ceylon at the time, in November 1832. The club soon became a hub for cricketing activity in the country, becoming the \"de facto\" governing body for cricket in Ceylon.\nThe Colombo Club went through an expansion phase in 1863, becoming the Colombo Gymkhana Club, a parent/umbrella organisation that acted as a social club while at the same time administering a number of different sports clubs- the CCC included (alongside the CH&amp;FC for rugby and hockey in 1892 and the Queen's Club for tennis and squash in 1899). The CCC is thought to have been formally named with its current name sometime in 1863, and moved to Galle Face Green sometime during this period as well.\nIn 1894, the club moved again, this time to its present address at Maitland Crescent. It remained a Europeans-only club until 1962, and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2013.\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold. Updated as on 31 July 2022"

There were 94 competitors from 15 nations, a large increase from the 9 fencers who had competed in 1904. The event was won by Nedo Nadi of Italy, the first of his two victories in the event. His countryman Pietro Speciale took silver, while Richard Verderber of Austria took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). The organizers of the 1912 Games explicitly rejected the 1908 organizers' view that foil fencing was not suitable for competition. The only fencer from 1904 to return was silver medalist Albertson Van Zo Post of the United States. France and Italy were the strongest nations in foil fencing; a dispute over the rules led to the French team boycotting the fencing competitions.\nBohemia, Denmark, Great Britain, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, and South Africa each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its third appearance, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a four-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches. However, there were significant disputes over particulars of the rules, which led to the French boycott.\nResults.\nFinal.\nThe first tie-breaker was hits received in victories; Verderber and Berti each were hit 10 times in their 4 wins, while Alaimo was hit 11 times in his 4 wins.

        "title": "Fencing at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's épée",
        "text": "The men's épée was a fencing event held as part of the Fencing at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the fourth appearance of the event, which had been introduced in 1900. The competition was held from 11 to 13 July at the Östermalm Athletic Grounds. There were 93 competitors from 15 nations. Each nation could enter up to 12 fencers. The event was won by Paul Anspach of Belgium. His countryman Philippe le Hardy took bronze. Silver went to Denmark's Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier, the only medal won by the perennial Olympian who competed in seven Games over 40 years. The medals were the first in the men's épée for both nations.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the eight finalists from the 1908 Games returned: fourth-place finisher Robert Montgomerie of Great Britain, fifth-place finisher Paul Anspach of Belgium, and eighth-place finisher Martin Holt of Great Britain. 1904 bronze medalist Albertson Van Zo Post (this time correctly recognized as American rather than Cuban) also returned. The event was heavily impacted by boycotts by two of the top fencing nations over rules disputes. A dispute over the target area for foil fencing resulted in France initially boycotting the foil events and, at the last minute, expanding the boycott to all fencing events. A dispute over the maximum length of the épée blade resulted in Italy boycotting the épée events (though Italy did compete in other fencing events). These disputes would result in the creation of the \"Fédération Internationale d'Escrime\" to establish a governing body for the sport. \nAustria, Greece, Portugal, and the Russian Empire each made their debut in the event. Belgium, Germany, Great Britain, and the United States each appeared for the third time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was held over four rounds. In each round, each pool held a round-robin, with bouts to 1 touch. Double-touches counted as touches against both fencers. Rather than hold separate barrages to separate fencers tied in the advancement spot (as had been done in 1908), the head-to-head results of bouts already fenced were used.\nResults.\nFinal.\nThree of Holt's matches were double-losses: those against le Hardy, Boin, and Seligman."

        "text": "The 1990 CART PPG Indy Car World Series season was the 12th national championship season of American open wheel racing sanctioned by CART. The season consisted of 16 races, and one non-points exhibition event. Al Unser Jr. was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was Eddie Cheever. The 1990 Indianapolis 500 was sanctioned by USAC, but counted towards the CART points championship. Arie Luyendyk won the Indy 500, his first-ever victory in championship-level competition, and the fastest 500 until the 2013 Indianapolis 500.\nAl Unser Jr. won a total of six races, one pole position, and had a total of ten podium finishes en route to the championship. He finished 4th at Indy, and won his first career oval race a week later at Milwaukee. He also tied a series record by winning four consecutive races during a stretch in July–August. Unser's victory at the Michigan 500 was his first superspeedway win. Michael Andretti was Unser's nearest competitor, winning five races and four poles. Andretti narrowed Unser's points lead to 37 points with two key victories late in the season. In the second-to-last race of the season at Nazareth, Unser crashed out, giving Andretti a huge opportunity to close the gap. Andretti managed only a 6th-place finish, and could not capitalize on Unser's misfortune. Unser left Nazareth with a 27-point lead, enough to clinch the championship regardless of the results at the season finale at Laguna Seca.\nFor 1990, Bobby Rahal's team owned by Maurice Kranes merged with Rick Galles's and it became a two-car effort known as Galles-KRACO Racing. Al Unser Jr. and Rahal became teammates, and Rahal got use of the Chevy Ilmor V-8 engine for the first time. Despite the upgrade in equipment, Rahal suffered a snake bitten season in 1990, finishing second five times, including runner-up finishes at both the Indy 500 and the Michigan 500. Despite finishing in the points in 14 races, it was the first season of his Indy car career he failed to win any races, and he managed only a 4th-place ranking in the final championship standings. Other team and driver shifts for 1990 included shake-ups at Penske and Patrick. Emerson Fittipaldi left Patrick Racing to join the Penske, and the original Patrick Racing Team transferred ownership to Chip Ganassi to become Chip Ganassi Racing. Pat Patrick returned with a new team, taking over the Alfa Romeo Indy car effort.\nThis was the final year in which March Engineering chassis were run.\nDrivers and constructors.\nThe following teams and drivers competed for the 1990 Indy Car World Series.\nSeason Summary.\nSchedule.\nTwo new races were added to the schedule in the form of street courses at Denver and Vancouver. Pocono was dropped from the schedule with the series citing safety concerns.\n- The Toronto race was supposed to run 183 miles, but was shortened by rain.&lt;br&gt;\n Oval/Speedway&lt;br&gt;\n Road/Street course&lt;br&gt;\n Non-championship event&lt;br&gt;"

It is based on the international level of ice hockey with teams from 1994 as opposed to domestic (intra-national) ice hockey leagues.\nGameplay.\nThere are several gameplay modes that can be chosen from the main menu of the game. These include exhibition mode, playoff mode, and an Olympic mode that is loosely based on the 1994 Winter Olympics. The object of the Olympic mode is to simply win the gold medal while the defeated team receives a silver medal. In order to qualify for the gold medal game, the player must rank in the top four in either \"League A\" or \"League B\" during the round-robin format; an \"X\" refers to a win while an \"O\" refers to a defeat. Achieving this will promote the player's team to a playoff of eight teams that will determine the gold and silver medal recipients. Teams that belong to opposite leagues eventually play against each other in the playoff mode.\nPeriods can either last for one minute, two minutes or three minutes long. Referees can be set to either \"real\" (similar to real international hockey), \"normal\" (similar to the NHL), or \"free\" (involving a visually challenged referee who only calls for icing). In the \"real\" mode, penalties are given for every body check while most body checking is allowed in \"normal\". However, both participants that are involved in a fight are penalized in both \"normal\" and \"real\" mode. This is offset by using extremely short durations in the penalty box due to the unrealistically low period durations."

        "text": "The Commonwealth Games sports comprise all the sports officially recognised and approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). There are a total of 16 core sports and a further 4 core para-sports that are competed at every games. In addition, the CGF allow organising committees to choose from various optional sports and disciplines to complete their games' program.\nAt the 1930 British Empire Games, the precursor to the modern Games, there were six sports: athletics, aquatics (swimming and diving), boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, and wrestling.\nSports, disciplines, events.\nIf a number of activities are controlled by the same international federation then the Commonwealth Games Federation recognises each activity as a discipline, which belongs to the respective sport. For example, shooting, which is organised by the International Shooting Sport Federation, is a sport at the Commonwealth Games that comprises four disciplines: clay target, full bore, pistol, and small bore. Furthermore, events for elite athletes with a disability (EAD) comprise a separate discipline within a sport from events for able-bodied athletes. This is the case both for sports where events for EAD and able-bodied athletes are organised by the different federations, as with athletics and World Athletics and the International Paralympic Committee, and for sports where there is a single federation, as with lawn bowls and the World Bowls.\nSports and disciplines feature separate events for which athletes can receive medals. For example, boxing has a number of weight divisions, gymnastics and diving have a number of styles, while athletics has numerous events based upon a wide range of activities.\nTypes.\nThe Commonwealth Games sports are divided into three main types: core sports, optional sports, and recognised sports. Sixteen core sports and four core para-sports must be included in the Games program, while the host nation may choose to include a number of optional sports and disciplines. Recognised sports are sports which have been approved by the CGF but are deemed to need further growth before their inclusion. The host nation may also apply for the inclusion of a maximum of four team sports to the CGF General Assembly, as the Melbourne organising committee did with basketball for the 2006 Games.\nThe CGF recognises Commonwealth Games records for a number of sports. In 2002, the CGF introduced the David Dixon Award for the outstanding athlete of the Games.\nCore, Optional and Discontinued Commonwealth Games program.\nThe following sports (or disciplines of a sport) make up the core, optional and discontinued Commonwealth Games official program and are listed alphabetically according to the name used by the CGF. The figures in each cell indicate the number of events for each sport contested at the respective Games; a bullet () denotes that the sport was contested as a demonstration sport. The Commonwealth Games Charter requires games to include 20 core sports, disciplines and para-sports.\nPara-sports were first included in the official program as demonstration sports in 1994 before being fully integrated into the main program in 2002. Between 1962 and 1974, Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were organised directly preceding the able body games; a \"p\" below denotes that a para-sport was part of the Paraplegic Games program for that year.\nEleven sports consist or have consisted of multiple disciplines. Disciplines from the same sport are grouped under the same color:\n Aquatics –\n Archery –\n Athletics –\n Basketball –\n Cycling –\n Gymnastics –\n Lawn bowls – \n Shooting –\n Table tennis –\n Triathlon –\n Wrestling\nDemonstrations sports.\nCommonwealth Games programs have also contained a number of demonstration sports, also variously called exhibition sports. The following sports or disciplines have been demonstrated at the Commonwealth Games for the years shown, but have never been included in the main program.\nIn 2014 and 2018, rugby league nines competitions were held preceding the games. These were endorsed by the CGF but were not listed as official demonstration sports.\nChanges from 2026.\nIn October 2021, the CGF announced a new games roadmap that will, starting with the 2026 Games, change the requirements for sports competed at the games. The roadmap suggests that approximately 15 sports should be competed at each games. There will be a new category of \"Compulsory Sports\", containing just athletics and swimming as well as their para-sport disciplines, and these will be the only sports that hosts are required to include in their program. The category of \"Core Sports\" will be expanded to include all other current core and optional sports; however, these will not be mandatory and it will be at the hosts' discretion how many are included in their program. Hosts will also be permitted to propose other sports beyond this core list for inclusion based on their popularity in the host nation or region."

A maximum of four riders from each nation was allowed. The entries closed on 1 June 1912. Every rider had to ride only one and the same horse in the event.\nResults.\nThe start and finish were both on the grounds of the Field Riding Club. In consequence of the hot weather prevailing, the ground was very hard. All the competitors were previously shown the course, which was marked with red flags. In addition to this, a map of the course and definite instructions were given by the guides to the competitors.\nTrial 1 – Long distance ride.\nSaturday, 13 July: 8 a.m. (Starting interval five minutes) Course of the \"Fältridtklubben\" (Stockholm Cross Country Riding Club) Riders had 4 hours to cover a distance of 55 kilometres. Jacques Cariou set the fastest time. One rider had a deduction for being 40 seconds too slow and one rider retired.\nTrial 2 – Cross country ride.\nSaturday, 13 July: The five kilometres course could not be called difficult, the obstacles consisting chiefly of fences, with or without ditches, and streams, however only the heat was oppressive. 15 minutes were allotted. Points were deducted both for going over time (which no rider did) and for faults. Three riders were disqualified due to riding the wrong way. The raw score was 130 points; it was divided by 13 and rounded to two decimal places to get a standardized score for the overall competition.\nTrial 3 – Individual riding over steeplechase course.\nMonday, 15 July: The third trial was a steeplechase, which took place at Lindarängen. 5 minutes and 50 seconds were allotted. Deductions were taken both for time and for obstacles, though no rider incurred any obstacle faults. Three riders had a deduction for going over time, which causes two points every second. One rider did not start and one rider was disqualified due to riding the wrong way. Bryan Lawrence did not finish the race after falling at a grass-covered ditch outside the course. The accident causing a slight concussion of the brain, from which the rider soon recovered, however. Raw scores were out of 100, divided by 10 to get a standardized score.\nTrial 4 – Prize jumping (Show jumping test).\nAfter the presentation on Monday afternoon of the prizes won in track and field events, the Stadium had been transformed into an obstacle-course, with flower-beds here and there.\nTuesday, 16 July: The fourth trial was an obstacle jumping course, which took place in the Olympiastadion. 15 obstacles, which were of small dimensions and fewer in number than for the other prize jumping events, had to be cleared perfectly. 2 minutes and 45 seconds were allotted. Deductions were taken both for time and for not completely clearing obstacles. One rider did not start and two riders were disqualified. Raw scores were out of 150, which were divided by 15 and rounded to two decimal places to get a standardized score.\nThe obstacles:\nTrial 5 – Prize riding (Dressage test).\nWednesday, 17 July: The prize riding was also held in the Olympiastadion. The score for the final event was determined by a panel of 7 judges, each giving a score of up to 110. The maximum raw score was therefore 770, which was divided by 77 and rounded to two decimal places to standardize it for the overall competition."

        "text": "The Israel national ice hockey team () is the national men's ice hockey team of Israel. Israel was ranked 35th as of May 2017 by the International Ice Hockey Federation. In 2019, the team won the gold medal in the 2019 IIHF World Championship Division II Group B tournament in Mexico City.\nIts greatest achievement in its history was winning its division II group in 2005 and being promoted to division I for the first, and thus far only, time. Israel was relegated back to division II a year later.\nWorld Championships record.\nEliezer Sherbatov drew international attention when he first played in the 2005 IIHF World U18 Championship Division III, in Bulgaria, at the age of 13, becoming the youngest player to step on the ice in an under-18 ice hockey world championship. He scored 9 points (4 goals + 5 assists) in 5 games, as the team won a bronze medal, Israel's first in hockey in a championship tournament.\nThe team was promoted to the IIHF World Championship Division I in 2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. The following year the team was relegated again to Division II. In 2010, Israel was relegated to Division III.\nHowever, in 2011 the team finished first in Division III Group B, earning a promotion back to Division II. Israel won all five of its games by a combined score of 57–9, and was promoted to the IIHF Division II WHC to be played in 2012. Sherbatov led the tournament in points, goals, assists, and +/-, earning 26 points (14 goals + 12 assists) in just four games. He was named the best forward of the tournament.\nAt the 2012 IIHF World Championship Division II tournament in Bulgaria, the Israeli team was able to stay in the second division. Beginning in 2015 and still as of 2020, Sherbatov was captain of the national team.\nIn 2019, the team won the gold medal in the 2019 IIHF World Championship Division II Group B tournament in Mexico City, Israel's first gold medal in hockey. With the win, the team qualified for the World Championships Division 2A. Sherbatov was named Best Forward, and had the best +/- rating, was the top goal scorer, and was the top scorer with 15 points (7 goals + 8 assists) in 5 games.\nOlympics.\nIsrael has tried to qualify for the Olympics four times. In their first attempt in 1996 for the 1998 Winter Olympics they played Greece in a preliminary match in Metula, which they lost 10-2. However, Greece used ineligible players, so Israel played another preliminary match against Yugoslavia, in Kaunas. Israel lost the game 5-3, but ended up being disqualified anyways due to use of ineligible players from Russia. The scores for both forfeited matches are recorded as 5-0.\nIsrael's second attempt was in 2012 for the 2014 Winter Olympics, where they were the lowest-ranked country attempting to qualify at 40th place. Israel was placed in a preliminary qualifying group with Croatia, Serbia and Mexico for a round-robin qualifier in Zagreb, in which they lost every game.\nIn 2015 Israel attempted to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics, and were placed in the first preliminary round. In their group matches held in Tallinn, they were unable to qualify for the second preliminary round, beating Bulgaria but losing to Estonia and Mexico.\nIsrael's most recent attempt was in 2019 for the 2022 Winter Olympics. For the first time, they were ranked high enough to skip the first round of qualification, and were placed in the second pre-qualification round held in Brașov. In their group they lost to Romania and Iceland, but were able to beat Kyrgyzstan in overtime.\nTeam.\nRoster.\nRoster for the 2024 IIHF World Championship.\nCoaches.\nList of coaches for each tournament"

        "title": "Jim O'Brien (American football)",
        "text": "James Eugene O'Brien (born February 2, 1947) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker and wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). O'Brien played for the Baltimore Colts from 1970 to 1972 and the Detroit Lions in 1973. O'Brien is best remembered for kicking the game-winning field goal in the final seconds of Super Bowl V, making him the first of only three placekickers to accomplish such a feat.\nEarly life.\nJim O'Brien was born on February 2, 1947 in El Paso, Texas. He later moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he graduated from Aiken High School. \nCollege career.\nO'Brien enrolled at the United States Air Force Academy in 1966, but received a medical discharge for ulcers.\nO'Brien then attended the University of Cincinnati, originally on a basketball scholarship. On the Cincinnati football team, he split duties between placekicker and wide receiver. In 1968, O'Brien led the nation in scoring with 142 points, with 44 receptions for 1,107 yards and 12 touchdowns as a receiver and making 13 field goals and 31 PATs as a placekicker. During his senior season in 1969, O'Brien set an NCAA Division I record by averaging 21.9 yards per catch. \nHe was invited to the North–South Shrine Game and the Coaches All-America Game during his college career.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Colts (1970-1972).\nO'Brien was selected by the Baltimore Colts in the third round of the 1970 NFL draft. \n1970 season.\nIn O'Brien's rookie year, he made 36 of 38 PATs and 19 of 34 field goals, with a long of 48 yards. He also recorded one reception for 28 yards in the final regular season game against the New York Jets. The Colts ended the 1970 regular season with an 11-2-1 record and defeated the Cincinnati Bengals and Oakland Raiders in the playoffs to earn a spot in the Super Bowl.\nSuper Bowl V.\nIn Super Bowl V, the Colts faced the Dallas Cowboys in Miami, Florida. The Cowboys took an early lead on two field goals by Mike Clark before Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas completed a tipped pass to tight end John Mackey for a 75-yard touchdown. O'Brien's subsequent PAT attempt was blocked, leaving the game tied at 6-6. Later in the second quarter, the Cowboys scored a touchdown on a Craig Morton throw to Duane Thomas to take a 13-6 lead. Unitas was also knocked out of the game and replaced by Earl Morrall.\nIn the third quarter, O'Brien missed a 52-yard field goal that fell short of the goal post. The game's next score did not occur until the fourth quarter. Morton was intercepted by Colts safety Rick Volk who returned the ball to the Cowboys' 3-yard line. Colts running back Tom Nowatzke scored two plays later, capped by an O'Brien PAT to tie the game again at 13-13. \nWith the game still tied late in the fourth quarter, the Cowboys had possession with a chance to win. An offensive holding penalty followed by a Morton interception to linebacker Mike Curtis gave the Colts the ball back on the Cowboys' 28-yard line. The Colts ran two plays on offense before bringing in O'Brien on third down to kick a 32-yard field goal with nine seconds remaining.\nO'Brien later claimed that he was concentrating so hard that he \"remember(ed) everything but not much.\" O'Brien made the kick, and the Colts took a 16-13 lead with five seconds remaining in the game. O'Brien performed a squib kick on the ensuing kickoff, leaving one second remaining on the clock. Morton threw an interception to Colts safety Jerry Logan on the final play, sealing the Colts victory.\nO'Brien's game-winning field goal in the final seconds was the first in Super Bowl history. This feat has since been accomplished three more times, twice by Adam Vinatieri with the New England Patriots and once by Harrison Butker with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n1971 season.\nIn the 1971 season, O'Brien made 35 of 36 PATs and 20 of 29 field goals, with a long of 50 yards made against the New England Patriots in week three. In that same game, O'Brien had three made field goals of over 40 yards and two PATs. The Colts went 10-4 before losing in the to the Miami Dolphins where O'Brien had two missed field goals. \n1972 season.\nIn 1972, O'Brien's field goal percentage dropped to a career-low 41.9%, having made only 13 of 31 attempts with a long of 42 yards. He did not miss a PAT during the season, going 24 for 24. However, on offense he had his best season at wide receiver. O'Brien had 11 receptions for 263 yards and two touchdowns during the season. He also had three rushing attempts for nine yards. His first career touchdown reception came against the New York Jets in week six on a 13-yard pass from quarterback Marty Domres. The Colts went 5-9 on the season and did not make the playoffs.\nIn July 1972, O'Brien was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for a draft pick. Citing his declining field goal accuracy, Colts head coach Howard Schnellenberger and general manager Joe Thomas asked O'Brien to remain on the team as a wide receiver. O'Brien disagreed and was traded. \nDetroit Lions (1973).\nO'Brien spent one season in Detroit. He made eight of 14 field goals with a long of 39 yards. He went 14 for 14 on PATs. On offense, he had two receptions for 14 yards. O'Brien was released by the Lions in the final round of cuts before the start of the 1974 season.\nNew York Giants (1975).\nAfter one year out of the NFL due to an off-the-field eye injury, O'Brien was signed by the New York Giants in May 1975. O'Brien spent the offseason competing for the kicking position before he was cut in September 1975 prior to the start of the regular season.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring from the NFL, O'Brien moved to Southern California where he is a construction manager."

        "title": "Audax (cycling)",
        "text": "Audax is a cycling sport in which participants attempt to cycle long distances within a pre-defined time limit. Audax is a non-competitive sport: success in an event is measured by its completion. Audax has its origins in Italian endurance sports of the late nineteenth century, and the rules were formalised in France in the early twentieth century.\nIn the present day, there are two forms of Audax: the original group-riding style, Euraudax, governed by Unions des Audax, and the free-paced (\"allure libre\") style usually known as Randonneuring, governed by Audax Club Parisien. The original form is mostly popular in France, but also in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Randonneuring is popular in many countries including Malaysia, France, Great Britain, Singapore, Australia, Canada, the USA and China.\nIn late nineteenth-century Italy, day-long \"challenge\" sports became popular. Participants aimed to cover as much distance as possible and prove themselves \"audax\" (\"audacious\"). The first recorded audax cycling event took place on June 12, 1897, when twelve Italian cyclists attempted the challenge of cycling from Rome to Naples, a distance of 230 km, during daylight hours. Similar events became popular elsewhere, and in 1904 French journalist Henri Desgrange produced Audax regulations, which belonged to his \"Auto\" newspaper.\nUnder the Audax regulations, riders rode as a group. Successful riders were awarded a certificate called a Brevet d'Audax. A group of successful audax cyclists formed the Audax Club Parisien (ACP), which took over the organisation of Audax events on Desgrange's behalf. In 1920, there was a disagreement between Desgrange and the ACP. Desgrange withdrew ACP's permission to organise events under his Audax regulations, and ACP created its own allure libre (free-paced) version of the sport, where successful riders were awarded certificates called Brevets des Randonneurs. Desgrange continued to promote the original Audax rules, and on July 14, 1921, the Union of Parisian Audax Cyclistes (UACP) was formed, which became the Union of French Audax in January 1956.\nEuraudax.\nParticipants in the original form of audax ride in a group, at a steady pace set by a road captain. The group aims to cycle at 22.5 km/h between stops. The route is planned with designated stopping points. In longer audax events the group may ride between 16 and 20 hours in a day before stopping at a designated sleeping location. The goal of the audax is for all group members to finish within the time limit.\nRandonneuring (allure libre form of audax).\nRandonneuring is similar to the original Audax style in that riders attempt to complete long-distance cycling events. However, instead of riding together in a group, participants are free to cycle at their own pace (French: allure libre), stop or sleep wherever they want and form groups randomly, provided they stay within the time limit.\nIn some countries (e.g. USA), a clear distinction is drawn between 'Audax' and 'Randonneuring'. In others, such as Australia and Great Britain, the original Audax style is relatively unknown, and 'Audax' and 'Randonneuring' are used interchangeably.\nOrganisations.\nThe official organisation for the original audax style is the Union des Audax in France. The official organisation for randonneuring is Audax Club Parisien."

        "text": "Kevin Reece Wilson (born October 23, 1961) is an American football coach and former player who is the head coach at the University of Tulsa. He was the offensive coordinator at Ohio State University from 2017 to 2022. Wilson was head coach at Indiana University from 2011 to 2016, and offensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma from 2002 to 2010.\nPlaying career.\nWilson played offensive line and linebacker at Maiden High School in Maiden, North Carolina. He was all-conference for two seasons and for his senior season was named to the \"Charlotte Observer\" All-Piedmont team.\nHe went on to play center and guard for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels football team as a walk-on. After two seasons as a walk-on he earned a scholarship. He earned a degree in Education in 1984, and then became a graduate assistant for three years while working on a master's degree in Physical Education.\nWhile at North Carolina Randy Walker was a Tar Heels assistant. When Walker left Northwestern to become head coach at Miami University in 1990, Wilson became his assistant there.\nCoaching career.\nNorth Carolina.\nAfter playing for the North Carolina Tar Heels, he spent three seasons (1984–1986) as a graduate assistant coach while he worked on his master's degree. In 1987, he became the offensive line coach at Winston-Salem State University. Wilson was the offensive coordinator for the 1988 season for the North Carolina A&amp;T Aggies.\nFoard High School.\nIn 1989, he became the head coach and athletic director of Fred T. Foard High School in Newton, North Carolina, near his hometown of Maiden, where the Tigers went 0–10. \"[Wilson] was dealt a very ugly hand. There was very little talent and probably less commitment.\" Considering the environment in which Wilson was raised, it's no surprise he grew frustrated quickly that so many players at Fred T. Foard didn't share his passion for football.\nMiami.\nFollowing one year coaching on the high school level, Wilson returned to college coaching for the Miami University RedHawks in 1990, under head coach Randy Walker, and coached there as offensive line coach, quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator until 1998.\nNorthwestern.\nWhen Walker moved to Northwestern University Wilson went with him, serving as the offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, and assistant head coach, from 1999 to 2001. Wilson's power-spread offense led the Wildcats to a Big Ten Conference co-championship in 2000 and led conference in rushing for the first time in 54 years.\nOklahoma.\nAfter spending 19 seasons under the tutelage of his mentor Walker (four as a player at North Carolina, three as a graduate assistant there, nine as a coach at Miami, and three as a coach at Northwestern), Wilson left his long-time mentor to become the running game coordinator and the offensive line coach at Oklahoma in 2002. Wilson caught Stoops' attention after Wilson adopted \"Leach-style\" passing offense that was then morphed into the spread run game. In December 2005, Wilson was named the offensive coordinator for the Sooners prior to the 2006 season, replacing Chuck Long who left to become the head coach at San Diego State. Oklahoma named James Patton to replace Wilson as offensive line coach, Patton served under Wilson at both Northwestern and Miami, and Wilson recommended Patton to Sooners' head coach Bob Stoops. In 2008, Wilson won the Broyles Award, which is given to the top assistant in college football annually. He was also named the \"FootballScoop Offensive Coordinator of the Year\".\nIndiana.\nIndiana athletic director Fred Glass announced the dismissal of Bill Lynch and the rest of the coaching staff on November 28, 2010, following a third straight season with only one conference victory. Glass announced the hiring of Wilson on December 7, giving Wilson his first collegiate head coaching position. Just thirteen days later Wilson hired New Mexico defensive coordinator Doug Mallory and Nebraska linebackers coach Mike Ekeler (also LBs) as co-defensive coordinators. Mallory, the son of former Indiana head coach Bill Mallory, was Indiana's defensive backs coach from 1994–1996. Wilson also hired Rod Smith from Michigan and Kevin Johns from Northwestern to be co-offensive coordinators. Wilson took over a Hoosiers team that had finished 10th or 11th in the Big Ten in each of the previous three seasons and had not been to a bowl since losing to Oklahoma State in the 2007 Insight Bowl.\nUnder Wilson's first year, the Hoosiers had a 1–11 record. In his second year, Indiana improved to 4-8 on the year with Wilson's team exhibiting an explosive offense, going from 80th nationally in pass offense to 19th and leading the Big Ten with 311.2 yards per game, in spite of losing the starting quarterback Tre Roberson in the season's second game.\nIn 2015, Indiana finished the regular season with a 6-6 record and showed a much more competitive level of play in the Big Ten. Indiana received an invitation to play in the Pinstripe Bowl, their first bowl game since 2007. After the season ended, Wilson signed a 6-year, $15.3 million contract extension that ran through 2021. Wilson resigned from Indiana on December 1, 2016, after multiple internal investigations into mistreatment of players.\nOhio State.\nOhio State announced January 10, 2017 that Wilson had been hired as the offensive coordinator and tight ends coach under head coach Urban Meyer. In the 2017 season, Wilson assisted the Buckeyes to a 12-2 season which included a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a win over the University of Southern California in the Cotton Bowl Classic.\nIn the 2018 season, Wilson worked as Co-Offensive Coordinator with Ryan Day. Wilson would be a part of 13-1 season with another Big Ten Championship Win, this time over Northwestern, and a Rose Bowl victory against Washington.\nWilson worked as Co-Offensive Coordinator with Mike Yurcich under their new head coach, Ryan Day. The Buckeyes finished the season 13-1, with another Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a trip to the College Football Playoffs.\nTulsa.\nThe University of Tulsa announced on December 5, 2022, that Wilson would be the next head football coach for the Golden Hurricane, but would remain with Ohio State through the end of their College Football Playoff run.\nWilson's offensive statistics.\nUniversity of Oklahoma\nWilson's 2008 up-tempo and no-huddle Oklahoma offense resulted in the Sooners scoring at least 60 points in every one of their last 5 conference games and a 65-21 victory over undefeated Texas Tech. The Sooners' quarterback, Sam Bradford, finished the 2008 season with 4720 passing yards and 50 passing touchdowns. It was after the 2008 season that Wilson received the Broyles Award as the top assistant coach of the year.

He played professionally as a tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. \nBrock played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes and was selected in the first round of the 1980 NFL Draft with the 18th overall pick. After his playing career, he served as the head football coach at United States Military Academy from 2007 to 2008. Brock was fired on December 12, 2008, after compiling a 6–18 record in two years as head coach.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nBrock played football at Jesuit High School in his hometown of Portland before attending the University of Colorado at Boulder where he played under coaches Bill Mallory and Chuck Fairbanks. He was selected to the first team All-American by \"The Sporting News\". as a senior in 1979. He was also selected as first team all Big Eight Conference and the John Mack Award winner, Colorado's award for offensive MVP.\nNFL.\nBrock played for the New Orleans Saints from 1980 to 1992. He finished his career with the San Diego Chargers from 1993 to 1995. He played in Super Bowl XXIX for the Chargers. Stan's older brother Pete also played in the NFL for the Patriots, starting at center in Super Bowl XX, which coincidentally was played in New Orleans.\nBrock was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame in 1997.\nCoaching career.\nAfter his playing career, Brock became a coach in the Arena Football League (AFL), where he served as the head coach of the Portland Forest Dragons (1997–1999) and the Los Angeles Avengers (2000–2001). He also was a color analyst for radio broadcasts of Saints games for several seasons, succeeding Archie Manning, who resigned position when son Peyton entered the NFL with the Indianapolis Colts.\nOn January 29, 2007, he was named the head coach at Army after the resignation of Bobby Ross. During his time as head coach, the Black Knights posted a 6–18 record and lost twice to Navy by a combined score of 72–3. On December 8, 2008, Brock was fired by the USMA on December 12, 2008, after two years as head coach, and six days after the Black Knights completed their 2008 season with a 34–0 loss to archrival Navy.\nDevelopment and implementation of the \"Brock Bone\" offense.\nFollowing a 3–9 record in his first season as Army's head coach, Brock and his staff decided to change his offensive system from the pro set to something more similar to Navy's triple option, something Brock had once described as \"a stupid idea.\" During spring training for the 2008 season, Brock elected to close spring practices to implement his new offense. The offense Brock developed was dubbed \"the Brock Bone\" by ESPN commentator Shaun King. The Brock Bone seems to employ a higher percentage of fullback dives than are ordinarily seen in a triple option offense. Coach Brock has commented, \"People think that we're just calling fullback dive, but when that’s what they give you, that’s what they give you.\" Army ran the Brock Bone during the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and finished the season ranked 110th out of 119 NCAA Division I FBS teams in total offense.\nBroadcasting career.\nOn January 14, 2015, Portland, Oregon television station KOIN hired Brock as sports anchor.\nFamily.\nBrock and his wife, Lori, have four daughters: Sarah, Jessica, Rachel and Emily."

The renovation was completed by architect Chet Williams, known for his work across Texas including the design of Whispering Pines Golf Club in Trinity, TX. \nThe second course is the Jackrabbit course, which is used in qualifying rounds for the various USGA Championships the club has hosted, while Cypress Creek is the primary tournament venue. In 2020, golfers for the U. S. Women's Open played the first or second round at Jackrabbit with the other rounds at Cypress Creek because of the December tournament date caused by a global pandemic. The Jackrabbit course opened in 1964 and was designed by George Fazio, later renovated by nephew Tom Fazio.\nThe competitive course record at Cypress Creek is held by Chad Campbell, who shot a 10-under-par 61 in the third round en route to winning the Tour Championship in 2003, the last held at Champions.\nTournaments.\nThe club also hosts the Champions Cup Invitational, one of the premiere two-man best-ball amateur events, since 1961.\nNotable History.\nBen Hogan.\nBen Hogan was a frequent visitor to Champions and played in several tournaments hosted at the club. He played the last tournament of his career on the Cypress Creek course in 1971 after making a quintuple-bogey on Hole #4, a challenging par 3. Hogan hit his tee shot into the vegetation on the bank of the Cypress Creek and injured his knee searching for his ball. After deeming it unplayable, he returned to the tee box and hit two more shots into the Creek. He played his seventh shot onto the green and two putt for a score of 9. \nPhil Mickelson.\nPhil Mickelson visited Champions Golf Club in 1999 for putting lessons from Jackie Burke. Mickelson quipped that Billy Ray Brown warned him about missing short putts in front of Jackie, because Burke was notorious for punching unsuspecting students saying \"It's got to hurt when you miss those!\""

An arbitration panel appointed by the UK National Anti-Doping Panel concluded that Bailey had committed an anti-doping rule violation, but that the exceptional circumstances of the case were such that there was no fault or negligence to be apportioned to Bailey and therefore no suspension under the anti-doping rules should be applied. The panel heard evidence, including psychiatric evidence, over three days and heard that Bailey had during the testing process, developed a genuine, if unjustified, belief that the water offered to him by the testing officials was contaminated in some way. The panel also noted that Bailey did take a drugs test three days after the original incident that was negative and stressed that they did not consider Bailey a cheat or someone trying to cover up drug taking. The case is believed to be the first case where a player who has refused to take a test has not been punished.\nHonours.\nLeeds Rhinos\nWarrington Wolves\nToronto Wolfpack"

        "text": "The Kentucky Derby Museum is an American Thoroughbred horse racing museum located on the grounds of Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Dedicated to preserving the history of the Kentucky Derby, it first opened its doors to the public in the spring of 1985. Much of its early funding came from a donation from the estate of James Graham Brown.\nThe museum consists of two floors of exhibit space, including a 360-degree theater that shows the HD film \"The Greatest Race\". Through the film and exhibits, visitors can learn what goes into the breeding and training of a young foal and the path it takes to the Kentucky Derby's winner circle. Every Kentucky Derby win is honored in the Warner L. Jones Time Machine, where visitors can watch any Kentucky Derby from 1918 to the present day. Exhibits highlight the stories of owners, trainers and jockeys as well as the importance of African American jockeys and trainers to the race and the Thoroughbred industry. Guided tours of Churchill Downs' barn and infield areas, jockeys' quarters, \"millionaires row\" and press box are also offered. Exhibits were designed by Bruce Burdick's San Francisco design firm The Burdick Group.\n2010 renovation.\nThe museum was devastated by flash flooding on August 4, 2009, and remained closed for recovery and cleanup. Every exhibit on the main floor of the museum was affected in some way by water damage. Since the exhibits needed to be dismantled and many were destroyed, the museum's board of directors decided to embrace the opportunity for a renovation. The museum underwent major renovations and reopened on April 18, 2010, in time for the 2010 Kentucky Derby. Though a significant renovation had been planned, the flood damages accelerated the time schedule and increased the expected size of the renovation project.\nChampions' trophies.\nThe museum has documented the whereabouts of most of the trophies given to Derby winners. As of 2007, it is still working to locate ten missing trophies, eight of which are from the 1924 design currently in use, and two are of a different design given out in 1922 and 1923. The missing trophies for the year and its winner are as follows:\nChampions' cemetery.\nThe museum has arranged for the reburial on its grounds of five past Derby winners whose original graves were threatened by land development. The past champions now interred here are:\nThe 2006 Derby winner Barbaro (2003–2007) is interred just outside an entrance to Churchill Downs, and also outside the museum. Owners Roy and Gretchen Jackson chose to bury his remains in a location where his admirers would not have to pay an admission fee."

        "text": "Sailing/Yachting is an Olympic sport starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule.\nThe Sailing program of 1912 consisted of a total of four sailing classes (disciplines). For each class two races were scheduled from 19 July 1912 to 22 July 1912 off the coast of Nynäshamn at the Baltic Sea.\nVenue.\nWhen Sweden was assigned to host the 1912 Olympic Games two cities wanted to be the venue for the sailing program. Gothenburg and Stockholm.\nGothenburg claimed that it was a much shorter passage for the oversees entries (about ) than it was to Stockholm. Stockholm however got the sailing program because of then all Olympic events should be in the same vicinity. As specific location Nynäshamn, about from Stockholm was chosen.\nThe Royal Swedish Yacht Club was requested to organize the sailing event. Discussions took place whether the races would take place at the same time period of the other Olympic events. Finally the decision was taken to hold them just after the other Olympic events. Also several other races were organized in conjunction of the Olympic races.\nCourse area.\nA inner and an outer course was created of the coast of Nynäshamn:\nCompetition.\nOverview.\nA maximum of 2 boats per country per class was allowed.\nCountries.\nSource:\nClasses (equipment).\nSource:\nAlthough one of the oldest organized sporting activities, sailing in the early first part of the 20th century was not uniformly organized. This had a lot to do with national traditions as well as with the fact that there were no standardized boat types with uniform building instructions and measurements. Also a lot of development was done in the area of boat design and boat building. The shape of a boat, specifically its length, its weight and its sail area, are major parameters that determine the boat's speed. Several initiatives were started to create a formula that made it possible to have boats race each other without having to calculate the final result. But the different countries initially could not agree on an international system. At the Olympics of 1900 it was clear that sailing was not ready for international competition, and something had to be done.\nIn 1906 international meetings were organize to solve the problem. Finally in Paris, October 1907 the first International Rule was ratified. Delegates from this meeting went on to form the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU), the precursor to the present International Sailing Federation (ISAF).\nThe agreed formula gives a result in meters (Metre). During the meeting in 1907 the IOC made the decision to open the 1908 Summer Olympics for the following Metre classes:\nMedal summary.\nSource:\nMedal tables.\nThe official report used a points system to rank participating nations in the sport: \nOther information.\nSailors.\nDuring the sailing regattas at the 1912 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:"

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, when it was not held because of World War II.\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, played by the only two teams remaining in contention, and the result determines which country is declared the world champion. It is a one-off match decided in regulation time. In case of a draw, extra time is used. If scores are then still level, a penalty shoot-out determines the winner, under the rules in force since 1986; prior to that, finals still tied after extra time would have been replayed, though this never proved necessary. The golden goal rule would have applied during extra time in 1998 and 2002, but was not put in practice either.\nThe only exception to this type of format was the 1950 World Cup, which featured a final round-robin group of four teams; the decisive match of that group is often regarded as the \"de facto\" final of that tournament, including by FIFA itself.\nThe team that wins the final receives the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and its name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy. Of 80 different nations that have appeared in the tournament, 13 have made it to the final, and 8 have won. Brazil, the only team that has participated in every World Cup, is also the most successful team in the competition, having won five titles and finished second twice. Italy and Germany have four titles each, with Germany having reached more finals than any other team, eight. Current champion Argentina has three titles, Uruguay and France have two each, while England and Spain have one each. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands and Croatia have played in the final without winning. Only teams from Europe (UEFA) and South America (CONMEBOL) have ever competed in the final.\nArgentina defeated France on penalties in the latest final, staged at Qatar's Lusail Stadium in 2022.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

They initially played three other teams founded around the same time, Niagara, Brighton and Royal Engineers. London Canadians were founded at the same rink in 1902, and both teams participated in Europe's first ice hockey league, held from November 1903 to February 1904. Princes took second position in the five-team league.\nThe team began taking on European opposition in 1906, playing Sporting Club de Lyon. In 1907, they played Lyon again, and also Brussels Club des Patineurs. In 1908, they faced C. P. P. Paris in the first match in Britain under Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (international) rules. That winter, they entered the first international ice hockey tournament, held in Berlin, as \"England\", beating Germany and France. In January 1909, again playing as England, they won a further international tournament held in Chamonix, beating France in the final after forty minutes of overtime.\nOver the next few years, along with London Canadians' successors, Oxford Canadians, Princes began taking European tours to popularise the game and encourage the standardisation of rules. However, with the outbreak of World War I, Princes Skating Club closed, and with it the ice hockey team.\nIn 1927, a new Princes team were founded, playing out of the Westminster rink. They moved to Queens in 1930 and entered the first season of the English League the following year, but in 1932 merged into Queens Ice Hockey Club."

        "text": "Cambridge University Ice Hockey Club at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, is one of the oldest ice hockey teams in the world.\nWhile the team claims a history dating back to 1885, the first strong evidence for their existence comes on 16 March 1900, when they played Oxford University Ice Hockey Club in the first Ice Hockey Varsity Match, at Princes Skating Club in London, losing 7–6. This match was played, on Oxford's insistence, with bandy sticks and a lacrosse ball. The Cambridge team was led by J. J. Cawthra, who later played for England. The following day, the two universities joined together to play Princes Ice Hockey Club.\nCambridge played a second varsity match at Princes in 1901, this time winning 6–5. In 1903, they entered the first ice hockey league in Europe, but came last out of the five teams competing.\nThe squad then switched to playing European tours, popularising the sport, and from 1909 to 1913 and 1920 onwards playing an annual varsity match. From 1932, these matches were played in England, and although no longer able to compete with the top professional sides, they were watched by over 10,000 supporters.\nIn 1931, the club joined the English League, but when it finished in 1936 they did not follow most of the teams into the English National League, instead joining the lower-level London and Provincial League in 1938. In 1948, they played a season in the Southern Intermediate League, and in the 1970s they played two seasons in the Southern League. They then joined the Inter-City League and finally played in the inaugural season of the British Hockey League. Since then, they have contested an annual varsity match and compete in Division One of the British Universities Ice Hockey Association. Until 2019, when the Cambridge Ice Arena was completed, the team had to travel to Planet Ice Peterborough to train. This new full-size rink is the team's first permanent home, located adjacent to the Newmarket Road Park &amp; Ride site."

        "title": "Ice Hockey Varsity Match",
        "text": "The Ice Hockey Varsity Match is a longstanding competition between the Cambridge and Oxford University Ice Hockey Clubs.\nTradition places the origin of the match in 1885, when a game is said to have been played in St Moritz. This date is recognised by the Hockey Hall of Fame, and prior to the 1985 Varsity Match, the International Ice Hockey Federation formally recognised the game played a century earlier as having been the first ice hockey match played in Europe. However, there is no contemporary evidence that the 1885 match took place, and Oxford now claim that it was a bandy match. If the 1885 date is accepted, this is the oldest rivalry in ice hockey.\nThe oldest surviving evidence of the competition is a team photo and roster from 1895, for a game played on Blenheim Lake in Oxford, although this was definitely a bandy match. The first match usually counted as an ice hockey contest is that of 16 March 1900 at Princes Skating Club, although at Oxford's insistence, it was played using bandy sticks and a lacrosse ball.\nThe following year, another Varsity Match was played at Princes, this time with hockey skates and a puck. However, a 1902 match at Blenheim Lake was again a bandy match.\nThe competition became established in 1909; the two universities then met each other on a European rink each year until World War I. From 1927, the match has been played for the Patton Cup, named for Peter Patton, the first President of the British Ice Hockey Association. It was then played most years until 1932, when it returned to England, being played at Richmond Ice Rink. The annual matches of the 1930s may no longer have been of professional standard, but they were able to attract crowds up to 10,000 strong. In 2016, the Patton Cup was replaced by the King Edward VII Cup.\nOther than a gap during World War II, the matches have continued annually ever since, and from 1996 alternated between Oxford Ice Rink and a rink nominated by Cambridge. After a two-decade campaign, championed by Prof. Bill Harris, Cambridge University opened their own rink for the 2019-2020 season and hosted the 2020 Match. Oxford, historically strengthened by Rhodes Scholars have won more than two-thirds of the encounters."

        "text": "The Kansas City Blues were a minor-league hockey team based in Kansas City, Missouri that played in the Central Hockey League (CHL) from 1967 to 1972, and again in the 1976–77 season, mainly as an affiliate of the in-state St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nThe 1967 Blues were owned by Missouri Lieutenant Governor (1968-1972) William S. Morris, and represented the return of hockey to Kansas City for the first time in nearly 20 years. Morris was determined to bring an NHL team to Kansas City and tried to lay the groundwork by convincing his friend Sid Soloman, owner of the St. Louis Blues, to create a farm team in Kansas City. The Blues made history on February 21, 1971, when Blues goalie Michel Plasse became the first goaltender to score a goal in a professional hockey game, scoring against the Oklahoma City Blazers. This goal was witnessed by few as a snow storm was moving through the Kansas City area causing even Morris to leave the arena early.\nAlthough the Blues weren't always winners on the ice, they brought an exciting brand of hockey to Kansas City. Claude Cardin, who played in three seasons for the team, was once featured on the cover of a prominent Kansas City magazine with a chart of all of the scars on his face superimposed on his picture. Hardly any of his face was visible. Hockey from 1967 to 1972 featured fights that erupted into bench clearing brawls and some that erupted outside the rink with fans joining the action. Few players wore helmets in those days. Many future St. Louis Blues players made appearances on the ice at the American Royal Building, if only briefly, which was a thrill for fans of hockey of that era.\nThe first incarnation of the Kansas City Blues played their home games at the American Royal Building, while the second incarnation played their home games at Kemper Arena, once the NHL's Kansas City Scouts moved to Denver and became the Colorado Rockies."

        "text": "Field handball (also known as outdoor handball or grass handball) was a soccer-like outdoor form of what is now (indoor) handball. It was played at the Olympics once, at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. It was dominated by Germany, winning all World Championships (except when banned in 1948), with German teams (two of them post-war) never been beaten or tied by a non-German squad.\nThe sport is played on a grass field (similar to an association football field, using the same goals) between long, wide. The field has two parallel lines from the goal line, which divides the field into 3 sections; each section can have up to 6 players of each team. The goal area is a semicircular line with a radius, and the penalty mark at from the goal. The goal is the same as in soccer, wide and high.\nThe game is played with the same ball as the indoor type, by two teams of 11 players (plus 2 reserves), and in two periods of 30 minutes each. Compared to soccer and American football, a forward handball pass is slower and shorter with the round ball being thrown rather than getting kicked like the soccer ball, or being aerodynamically shaped like the gridiron football. \nIndoor handball used to be the winter alternative only. With quicker action and spectators being closer to it, similar to basketball, it gradually grew in popularity to replace field handball also in summer. The last IHF World Men's Outdoor Handball Championship was played in 1966 as the teams from both German states dominated the sport."

A first baseman who batted and threw right-handed, Horton played for the Boston Red Sox (1964–67) and Cleveland Indians (1967–70).\nCareer.\nHorton made his major league debut at age 19 in . He was a reserve first baseman for two seasons with the Red Sox until he was traded to the Indians in for Gary Bell, who won 12 games for the Red Sox during their pennant drive after going 1–5 in Cleveland. In 106 games played as an Indian, Horton batted .281 with 10 home runs and 44 runs batted in.\nAfter batting .249 in with 14 homers and 59 RBIs, Horton enjoyed his finest season in , batting .278 and establishing career bests with 27 home runs and 93 runs batted in.\n was a curious season for Horton. He batted .269 with 17 home runs and 59 RBIs in a season full of ups and downs. On May 24 of that year in the second game of a doubleheader, he hit three home runs in an 8–7 loss to the New York Yankees but was reportedly upset about not hitting a fourth. Exactly one month later, again against the Yankees and in the first game of another doubleheader, he fouled off a “folly floater” from Steve Hamilton. He asked for another \"Folly Floater,\" Hamilton threw it and Horton again popped it foul behind home plate, but this time into Thurman Munson's mitt for an out. An embarrassed Horton crawled back into the dugout.\nOn July 2, Horton hit for the cycle in a 10–9 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. His playing career ended unexpectedly on August 28, after he took himself out in the fifth inning of the second game of a doubleheader against the California Angels. He was treated and recovered, but the stress of professional baseball forced him to leave the game prematurely; he had played his last game three months shy of his 26th birthday. His manager, Alvin Dark, in his book \"When in Doubt, Fire the Manager,\" would call Horton's sudden exit “the most sorrowful incident I was ever involved in, in my baseball career.”\nIn his very short career, Horton batted .268 with 76 home runs and 297 RBIs in 636 games played. His early exit from the game has often been tied to Indian lore with the Curse of Rocky Colavito.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

When he was playing for the Philadelphia Phillies in , he is credited as the inventor of a scheme where he positioned himself, along with a pair of field glasses, behind a whiskey advertisement on the outfield wall. There was a specific letter \"O\" that he would open or close to signal to the batter what pitch was going to be delivered. Later, in , he devised another scheme where he was still placed behind the outfield wall, but instead would relay the catcher's signs by wire to a buzzer box inside the third base coach's box. The third base coach would then signal to the batter the sign. This latest scheme was discovered, however, when Tommy Corcoran of the Cincinnati Reds, tripped over he thought to be a vine coming out from under the ground, as he was rounding third base. Upon further inspection, the vine turned out to be a telegraph wire, and he proceeded to pull up out of the ground until it reach the spot where Murphy relayed his signals.\nPost-career.\nMurphy died at the age of 71 in Providence, Rhode Island, and is interred at St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket, Rhode Island."

Jones competed in both the 2-man and 4-man events in four Winter Olympics.\nHigh school.\nJones attended Robert B. Glenn High School in Kernersville, North Carolina and was a standout track and football star. Jones was a big part in helping lead the school to a boys track state championship in 1986. Jones graduated from Glenn High School in 1987.\nCollege career.\nJones attended Duke University, where he played football and ran track while earning a Mechanical Engineering degree. Graduating from Duke in 1991, he still holds five team football records for Duke in kick returns and was also a record-setting track athlete.\nBobsledding career.\nJones' track coach at Duke convinced him after graduating to try out for the U.S. Bobsled team. Combined with a desire to see the world, Jones accepted the invitation to join the team. He won the National Brakeman and Side Push Championship twice in both 1992 and 1995, along with the World Cup and Overall Championship in 1992–93.\nJones made his Olympic debut in 1994 in Lillehammer, finishing 13th in the 2-man event.

        "text": "The Jamaica national bobsleigh team represents Jamaica in international bobsleighing competitions. The men's team debut in the 1988 Winter Olympic Games four-man bobsleigh in Calgary, Alberta, was received as underdogs in a cold weather sport represented by a nation with a tropical environment. Jamaica returned to the Winter Olympics in the two-man bobsleigh in 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2014, and 2022; a women's team debuted in 2018.\nBeginnings.\nThe debut team, consisting of Devon Harris, Dudley Stokes, Michael White, Freddy Powell, and last minute replacement Chris Stokes, qualified at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Calgary, Alberta. Their coach was Howard Siler, an Olympic bobsledder for the United States in 1972 and 1980. Their \"underdog\" status as an unlikely competitor in a cold weather sport represented by a nation with a tropical environment quickly gained them popularity at the Games. They had little experience in the sport and had to appeal to other teams for basic equipment in order to compete; sporting camaraderie across national boundaries followed. In the third out of four runs, they lost control of the sleigh, crashed, and did not officially finish. Dudley Stokes and Michael White entered the two-man bobsleigh event, finishing 30th out of 41 teams.\nEvolution.\nThe team returned to the Olympics at the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in Albertville, France, and finished 25th. They qualified for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. Critics were stunned when they finished in 14th place, ahead of the United States, Russia, Australia, and France.\nAt the 2000 World Push in Monaco, the team won the gold medal.\nAt the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, the 2-man team of Winston Watts (pilot) and Lascelles Brown (brakeman) set the Park City bobsled track record and the Olympic record for the push-start segment of the 2-man race at 4.78 seconds. Jamaica failed to qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, and the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada. The two-man bobsled team qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.\nJamaica National Women's Bobsleigh team.\nJamaica competed in women's bobsleigh, with a crew of two coached by Norwegian Trond Knaplund, consisting of pilot Porscha Morgan and Wynsome Cole on brakes, winning World Push titles in 2000 and 2001. They achieved the fastest push times in all runs, resulting in a landslide victory. These women initiated the Jamaican women bobsleigh team/program and were seen as contenders in the sport. The programme suffered a setback because of lack of funding, and brakeman Wynsome Cole suffered injuries due to a crash, resulting in the team having to withdraw from a few of the competitions.\nThe team returned to competition at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, with KayMarie Jones and Salcia Slack competing in a North American Cup race in November 2014, ending an over 10 year absence of a Jamaican female crew in international competition. One of the athletes on the revived team was NaTalia Stokes, daughter and niece of former Jamaican bobsledders Chris and Dudley Stokes.\nModern day.\nJamaica qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, lacked funding, but within two days the cryptocurrency Dogecoin community raised on the team's behalf $30,000 of the approximately $40,000. An online campaign was set up, seeking to raise an additional $80,000 through the crowdfunding platform Tilt. The campaign closed on 22 January 2014, and surpassed the target goal having collected $129,687.\nFollowing the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, Todd Hays, former Olympic medalist and former coach of the Dutch and United States bobsleigh teams, was appointed head coach and technical director of the Jamaican team. However, he had to leave his role after one season due to a lack of funds to pay his salary, although he continued to work with the team in an unofficial capacity. Ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the Jamaican Bobsleigh Federation invested significantly in the team, buying a new sled for the women's crew of Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian and Carrie Russell, and filling a number of coaching positions, with former British, Dutch and Brazilian coach Jo Manning becoming High-Performance Director, former Olympic and World Champion Sandra Kiriasis joining as driving coach and Dudley Stokes being appointed as coach responsible for performance, mental preparation and general logistics. In January 2018, the Jamaica women's team qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. However the men's team missed out on Olympic qualification by one position in the world rankings. Days ahead of the start of bobsleigh training at the Games, Kiriasis parted ways with the Jamaica Bobsleigh Federation after she was told she would be demoted from her position as driver coach to the role of track and performance analyst. On 21 February, Fenlator-Victorian and Russell finished 19th in the two-woman Olympic bobsleigh event.\nCurrent.\nThe current team:\n2018 Winter Olympic team:\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1988 team inspired the reggae parody song \"Jamaican Bobsled\" by The Rock 'n' Roll Animals, played on the GTR radio station and later released on the CD \"Yatta, Yatta, Yatta\". The song was recorded after Jamaica had announced that they would be entering a bobsledding team into the Olympics, but before the Olympics had actually started; nevertheless, the lyrics accurately predict that the team would crash during one of their runs.\nIn 1993, Disney released \"Cool Runnings\", a film loosely based on and inspired by the team's experience in the four-man Bobsleigh at the 1988 Winter Olympics event.\nThe 1988 four-man team were referenced in the 1999 Futurama episode Xmas Story.\nThe 2014 team was the inspiration for \"The Bobsled Song\" written by Sidney Mills from Steel Pulse, Jon Notar, and Groove Guild. The music video features 8-bit graphics. The song is timed to sync up to the team's Sochi bobsled run. The song was widely shown on television Olympics coverage in the lead-up to the team's run."

        "title": "2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 79th midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was played at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York City, home of the New York Yankees, on July 15, 2008, and began at 8:47 p.m. ET. The game ended at 1:38 a.m. ET the following morning. The home American League won 4–3 in 15 innings, giving home field advantage in the 2008 World Series to the AL champion, which eventually came to be the Tampa Bay Rays.\nBy length of time, this was the longest MLB All-Star Game in history (4 hours and 50 minutes), and it also tied the mark for the longest game by innings played at 15 with the 1967 All-Star Game. Second baseman Dan Uggla of the Florida Marlins committed three errors, an All-Star Game record, none of which resulted in a run. J. D. Drew of the Boston Red Sox was named Most Valuable Player due to his two-run game-tying home run in the seventh inning. Drew won a Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid and the Ted Williams Trophy. It was the second All-Star Game in which the winning run was batted in by the Texas Rangers' Michael Young.\nBackground.\nAs with each All-Star Game since 1970, the eight starting position players of each league, as well as the American League's designated hitter, were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and a second fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.\nThe game was the sixth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series, the AL having clinched each of the first five opportunities. The AL entered the game on an 11-game unbeaten streak (10–0–1) as the NL continued to look for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia, still holding a 40–37–2 lead in the series.\nVenue selection.\nThe announcement of Yankee Stadium as the site of the game was made by MLB Commissioner Bud Selig and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on January 31, 2007, at New York's City Hall. Though it was the fourth game hosted at the Stadium and the eighth held in New York City, it was the first time since 1977 that the game had been played in the city (the last time also at Yankee Stadium). It had been speculated for months that the game would be held in Yankee Stadium, accelerated by the announcement that the 2008 season would be the 84th and final one for the stadium before the team moved into the new Yankee Stadium in 2009. Thus, it was seen as a fitting tribute to the old stadium that it host an All-Star Game in its final season.\nIt was the first All-Star Game to be played in a venue scheduled to close after that season.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2008 All-Star Game starters (excluding pitchers) began on April 29. Because the game was in an American League ballpark, fans were asked to select their favorite AL designated hitter in addition to all the position players. The top vote-getters at each position, and top three among outfielders, were named to start the game.\nVotes were cast online and at the 30 MLB ballparks. Monster was the sponsor of the online portion of balloting. There was a limit of 25 votes per e-mail address, but no limit to the number of ballots cast at the stadium. The deadline to cast votes was July 2. Rosters were announced on July 6. Alex Rodriguez led all players in votes for the second consecutive year with 3,934,518 votes, while Chase Utley led all National League players with 3,889,602 votes.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the Monster All-Star Final Vote to determine the 32nd and final player of each roster. Ballots were cast online between July 6 and 10 with the player in each league receiving the most votes added to the team rosters. The winners were Corey Hart of the Milwaukee Brewers and Evan Longoria of the Tampa Bay Rays. A record 47.8 million votes were cast in the balloting, shattering the record set the previous year of 23.2 million. Longoria's nine million votes more than doubled the individual record of 4.4 million set by San Diego Padres pitcher Chris Young in 2007.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAmerican League.\nSelected to start but unable to play due to injury. Milton Bradley took his place in the starting lineup.\nSelected to start but unable to play due to injury. Matt Holliday took his place in the starting lineup. David Wright took his place on the roster.\nWon the Monster All-Star Final Vote.\nUnable to play due to injury. Carlos Mármol took his place on the roster.\n&lt;br&gt;Lincecum was not available to the National League due to flu-like symptoms he suffered earlier in the day.\nGame.\nCeremonies.\nTo commemorate the last all-star game at Yankee Stadium, every living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame was invited to the game. Forty-nine players, coaches, and administrators accepted the invitation. Many of them participated in a pre-game parade that went up Sixth Avenue from Bryant Park to Central Park. During the pre-game ceremonies, the Hall of Famers were introduced and assumed their playing position on the field. Instead of announcing the league lineups separately and in batting order, as is usually done, both teams' starters were introduced simultaneously by position, and the players stood in position next to the Hall of Fame members on the field.\nThe colors were presented by the West Point Cadet Color Guard.\nA recording of O Canada was played, and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was sung by Sheryl Crow, during which a B-2 stealth bomber flew over. Four Yankees, all members of the Baseball Hall of Fame – Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Reggie Jackson and Rich Gossage – threw the ceremonial first pitch, with balls delivered to them by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\nDuring the seventh-inning stretch, Josh Groban sang \"God Bless America\".\nUmpires.\nThe six umpires working the 79th All-Star game were announced on June 25. The crew was led by Derryl Cousins, a thirty-year MLB veteran working his third All-Star game and his first behind the plate.\nCoaches.\nTigers manager Jim Leyland and Yankees manager Joe Girardi were selected as coaches by manager Terry Francona. The staff also included Brad Mills (bench coach), John Farrell (pitching coach), Dave Magadan (hitting coach), Luis Alicea (first base coach), DeMarlo Hale, (third base coach), and Gary Tuck (bullpen coach). Girardi also caught in the bullpen in the eighth and ninth innings for some of the American League relievers.\nNew York Mets manager Willie Randolph and San Diego Padres manager Bud Black were selected as coaches by manager Clint Hurdle. Randolph was later replaced by Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella after Randolph was fired by the Mets on June 16.\nGame summary.\nThe game-time temperature was , with the wind blowing out to center field at eight miles per hour. Cliff Lee threw the first pitch at 8:47 EDT. Starting pitchers Lee and Ben Sheets set the tone for the game by each throwing two scoreless innings. The game stayed scoreless until the fifth inning when Matt Holliday led off the inning with a home run off Ervin Santana to give the National League a 1–0 lead. The NL added a run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Lance Berkman to score Hanley Ramírez. The American League finally got on the board in the bottom of the seventh inning on a two-out, two-run home run by J. D. Drew off Edinson Vólquez, tying the game at two.\nIn the eighth inning, Miguel Tejada singled, and with one out attempted to steal second base. Catcher Dioner Navarro made a poor throw to get Tejada, and the ball ended up in center field, allowing Tejada to advance to third base on the error. Tejada scored on a sacrifice fly by Adrián González, and the NL retook the lead. In the bottom half of the inning, after Brian Wilson retired the first two batters, Billy Wagner gave up a single to Grady Sizemore. Sizemore proceeded to steal second base (one of a record six stolen bases by both sides), and pinch-hitter Evan Longoria hit a ground rule double to left field to tie the game once again. With Mariano Rivera in to pitch with one out in the ninth inning for the American League, Rivera struck out Ryan Ludwick and Navarro threw out Cristian Guzmán as he attempted to steal second, thus ending the inning. Ryan Dempster struck out the side in the bottom of the ninth to force the game into extra innings.\nIn the tenth inning for the American League, Michael Young and Carlos Quentin reached base on consecutive errors by Dan Uggla. Carlos Guillén was intentionally walked to load the bases with none out. With the infield and outfield drawn in, NL pitcher Aaron Cook induced ground balls from Sizemore and Longoria and the potential winning runs in both at bats were forced out at home. Cook successfully escaped the jam by getting Justin Morneau to ground out to Tejada to end the inning. The AL had another chance to win in the eleventh when Young singled with one out in the eleventh and Drew and Navarro on first and second. Navarro tried scoring from second on the hit, but was thrown out at home by Nate McLouth. Cook got Quentin to ground out to third and keep the game going.\nThe NL then had their chance to score in the twelfth off Joakim Soria, with the bases loaded and one out. Soria struck out Dan Uggla, and was relieved by George Sherrill, who struck out Adrián González to end the threat. In the bottom of the inning, Carlos Guillén hit a long fly ball that bounced off the left field wall for a double. After advancing to third base after a Grady Sizemore groundout, Cook, pitching his third inning of relief, struck out Longoria. Morneau was intentionally walked, and advanced to second base on defensive indifference. Cook got Ian Kinsler to ground out to end the inning.\nSherrill pitched scoreless innings in the 13th and 14th, while Carlos Mármol and Brandon Webb did the same for the NL, and the game moved into the 15th inning, tying the record set in 1967 for the longest All-Star Game in terms of innings played. At this point, each team was down to their final pitchers, raising concerns of the game finishing in a tie due to lack of pitchers. In the bottom of the 15th, Morneau led off with a single off Brad Lidge. A diving play by Ludwick robbed Kinsler of a base hit for the first out. Navarro then singled to move Morneau to second base, and Drew walked to once again load the bases. This time, the AL would capitalize; Michael Young flew out to right field, and Morneau was able to tag and just beat the throw from Corey Hart to score the winning run for a final score of 4–3. The American League's unbeaten streak in the All-Star Game was extended to 12 in a row. Young was credited a walk-off sacrifice fly.\nHome Run Derby.\nThe State Farm Home Run Derby took place on July 14. Josh Hamilton set a Home Run Derby record for most home runs in one round with 28. Justin Morneau won the derby.\nBroadcasters.\nThe All-Star Game was shown live in the United States on Fox Sports, with Joe Buck and Tim McCarver in the booth and sportswriter Ken Rosenthal as a field reporter. Yogi Berra visited the booth in the third inning.\nFor telecasts in other countries, the game was produced by Major League Baseball Properties under the name MLB International, with Gary Thorne and Rick Sutcliffe as the English-language announcers. In the U.S., the feed was simulcast by Fox Sports en Español with Spanish-language commentary.\nThe British rights-holder for this game, five (now known as Channel 5) ended its coverage at 6 a.m. BST with the game still in the 12th inning. The network explained that it had a commitment to carry the children's cartoon show \"The Wiggles\" that it could not break. The situation is similar to the infamous Heidi Game on the U.S. network NBC in 1968.\nThe radio rights in the U.S. were held by ESPN Radio; the announcers were Dan Shulman and Dave Campbell."

The ground is located on Point Gellibrand, the southernmost point of Williamstown which juts into Port Phillip Bay. The ground is currently the home of the Williamstown Football Club in the Victorian Football League, and the Williamstown Cricket Club in the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association.\nHistory.\nThe ground was established as early as the 1850s as a venue for cricket in Williamstown, and for the Williamstown Cricket Club which formed around the same time.\nSenior football was not played regularly at the Williamstown Cricket Ground until 1886. The Williamstown Football Club was unable to agree to terms with the cricket club for use of the ground, forcing the football club to play its matches without charging for admission at the unfenced Gardens Reserve; as a direct result of this dispute, a new senior football club, the South Williamstown Football Club, was established, and received permission to play its matches at the cricket ground. In 1888, the dispute ended; the two football clubs amalgamated, and the new club began playing all of its home games at the ground with the agreement of the cricket club.\nOne major grandstand, the W. L. Floyd Pavilion, was built during the 20th century, and is located on the south-western flank. It was initially opened in 1930, and in 1963 it was named after Larry Floyd, who served as club secretary in the 1930s and 1940s. The ground's location at Point Gellibrand, jutting slightly out into Port Phillip Bay, makes the seaside ground picturesque, but also windswept, often affecting play during football games and making for cold conditions during winter.\nThe venue was redeveloped between 2010 and 2012, which included refurbishing the Floyd Pavilion. A Crimean War era military bunker was unexpectedly uncovered beneath the outer during the redevelopment work."

        "title": "Ron Jacobs (basketball)",
        "text": "Ronald Jacobs (December 27, 1942 – December 24, 2015) was an American basketball coach. Jacobs was head coach of the men's basketball team of Loyola Marymount University. After turning the program around in just one season, he was invited by Philippine businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. to coach the Philippines men's national basketball team. Jacobs brought the Philippines back to prominence in basketball during the 1980s. He revolutionized the way basketball was played in the Philippines. He raised the level of technology in playing the game and turned every contest into a learning experience by showing how to win with science, hard work, team play and discipline.\nCareer.\nLoyola Marymount.\nJacobs was named West Coast Conference Coach of the Year for piloting the Loyola Marymount's basketball varsity to the NCAA Tournament in 1980. He had turned the program around in just a season from a lowly 5-21 pushover to a legitimate contender.\nJacobs became an overnight hero at the Loyola Marymount campus in Los Angeles and there emerged a popular clamor for him to take over as athletic director. This did not sit well with some in the school's Board of Trustees. Jacobs eventually left the university, exasperated by the politics that smeared his name.\nPhilippines.\nAs Jacobs reassessed his future, an invitation to visit Manila fell on his lap. Ambassador Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco, Jr. was appointed project director for basketball by Ferdinand Marcos. Having effectively sidelined then FIBA and BAP President Gonzalo \"Lito\" Puyat, Cojuangco sent BAP secretary-general Honesto Mayoralgo to the US to look for an American coach who could reinvigorate the sport in the Philippines. Mayoralgo was an Ateneo graduate who tapped his contacts in Jesuit schools to seek recommendations and was pointed at Jacobs' direction.\nJacobs came to the Philippines in 1980 along with another NCAA coach Ben Lindsey. Cojuangco, willing to give any amount just to get any of the two coaches, was to choose who among the two top-notch coaches he would hire to run the state of affairs of Philippine basketball. The jockeying for the position intensified so deeply that the two coaches, once good friends, eventually ended up bitter at each other. Jacobs allegedly threw negative statements behind Lindsey's back and he eventually earned Cojuangco's job for the coveted and lucrative position. Lindsey left the Philippines in a huff, fueling speculations, and Jacobs stayed behind.\nPhilippine men's national team (1981 to 1986).\nJacobs's first task was to improve the quality of basketball in the Philippines. After watching some Philippine Basketball Association games, he came up with the idea of naturalizing American collegiate players as Filipinos, to pass basketball technology to Filipino cagers.\nJacobs formed his first team in 1981; it had eight American players (Steve Schall, Steve Lingerfelter, Bruce Webster, Willie Polk, Eddie Joe Chavez, Jeff Moore, Dennis Still and Michael Antoine), two Filipino-Americans (Willie Pearson and Ricky Brown) and two local players (both from San Beda - JB Yango and Frankie Lim). The starting unit for that team included the 7'0 Steve Schall, the 6'8 Dennis Still, the 6'3 Jeff Moore, the 6'1 Eddie Joe Chavez and the 6'0 Ricky Brown. Steve Lingerfelter, at 6'9, was Schall's backup at the slot while Willie Pearson similarly languished at the bench. This team was sent to the 1981 William Jones Cup tournament where they beat a solid American team made up of US NCAA Division I collegiate players by more than 20 points in the finals and an average winning margin of more than 30 points against the others. The 1981 team encountered a backlash as Filipinos found it hard to accept the victory as the Americans were the ones responsible for the victory, with Yango and Lim being fielded sparingly. Jacobs eventually threw his program out of the window when Cojuangco feared the non-acceptance of the Filipinos.\nJacobs' next project was to retain the gold medal in the 1981 SEA Games. Noting the lack of competition, Jacobs decided to field former UE Red Warriors coach Pilo Pumaren instead as coach and gave him enough leeway to run the team. This 1981 team was made up mostly of MICAA and National Seniors players like Ricky Relosa, Bokyo Lauchengco, Itoy Esguerra, Ed Cordero, among others. The gold medal was won with President Marcos himself watching at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum, witnessing the near brawl from the solid kick made by Itoy Esguerra in the face of a Malaysian opponent in the finals.\nJacobs, for the first time, was to handle a national team consisting entirely of Filipino players for the 1982 Asian Youth title. In 1980, the Philippines lost to China - a bitter setback since the Philippines won the first 5 stagings of the tournament. The 1980 team included players like Zaldy Latoza, Elpidio Villamin, Bay Cristobal, Rey Lazaro among others and handled by Turo Valenzona. Jacobs decided to get players mostly from La Salle. This move by Jacobs drew raised eyebrows from the local basketball community as after all, Jacobs was closely associated with then La Salle coach Filomeno \"Pilo\" Pumaren. Jacobs choices were less talented, less athletic and unknown players in the collegiate ranks like La Salle players Jun Tan, Jong Uichico, Teddy Alfarero, Derrick Pumaren, Rey Cuenco of Arellano University and Alfie Almario. The only deserving players in Jacobs' list, as far as Philippine basketball leaders then were concerned, were Hector Calma of Adamson University, Louie Brill and Elmer Reyes of San Beda College. It was contended that the team Jacobs formed was weak since dominant collegiate players like Joey Loyzaga, Terry Saldaña and Sonny Cabatu were left out. Another criticism was that all players selected were above 19 years of age - the Asian Youth were only for players who were 19 years old and below. Hector Calma was reportedly a ripe 23 years old already by then. No team from 1970 to 1984 fielded in a legitimate lineup, and only when the media reported this in 1987 did the Philippines under Joe Lipa field a legitimate Youth team made up of Benjie Paras, Nelson Asaytono, Bong Alvarez, Eric Reyes, Jun Reyes, Bobby Jose among others.\nEven with the criticisms, the RP Youth team mangled the opposition heading towards the semifinals where met South Korea. This was the game Jacobs feared the most, especially since South Korea was bannering the very young but promising rookie Hur Jae. The Philippines won the game, 77-74, which featured a mini-brawl with the usual taunts and threats. The team was to meet China, who won over Japan, in the finals. In the finals, the Philippine side featured Alfie Almario's timely sniping from the outside, Hector Calma's masterful quarterbacking, and Teddy Alfarero's matching up well against China's star forward Wang Libin. The Philippines won the game 74-63 with Imelda Marcos and an overflow crowd of 25,000 in the Araneta Coliseum witnessing the game. Appreciation and the heart of the Filipino fans fell most on Calma and Almario. During the awarding ceremony, Imelda Marcos went to Calma and Almario and gave both players a hug with kisses on both sides of cheeks that drew an emotional applause from the crowd.\nIn 1983, Jacobs decided to retain the services of Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, owing to the lack of big men that the country faced. Having read through the FIBA rules where naturalized players can only play after 3 years of residency, he immediately submitted Moore and Still's application for naturalization. He then sought for a shooter in the US to provide the outside sock and eventually train the likes of budding shooters like Allan Caidic of UE, Pido Jarencio of UST, Jojo Lastimosa of Ateneo, and Ato Agustin of Lyceum. He recruited Arthur \"Chip\" Engelland of Duke University, who would be eligible to play by 1987 for the national team.\nIn 1984, the Philippines, under Jacobs, played in the ABC tournament held in Qatar. They won their first three games in the eliminations only to be forfeited because of the ineligibility of Engelland, Moore and Still. Howls of protest from the team did not prosper despite the initial assurance made by the ABC, eventually raising the suspicion that the Philippine team was set up to lose via technicality. The team went down 0-3 and the American members were barred from playing. The team didn't qualify for the quarterfinals and ended up in the classification round, where they beat the remaining rivals convincingly despite playing only their 9 Filipino players. Hence, they became the only team in the history of the ABC to have won all its games in the tournament but ended up 9th overall.\nIn the latter part of 1984, the Philippines won the Asian Interclub title to earn the right to play in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup to be held in Girona, Spain. The Philippines, playing as the Northern Consolidated Cement basketball team featuring Moore, Engelland and Still, went up against the Golden Eagles from the USA representing North America, CA Monte Líbano, representing Brazil (bannered by the De Souza brothers, wily point guard Milton Setrini, and the eminent Oscar Schmidt) representing South America, Banco di Roma Virtus (featuring Dino Meneghin) of Italy and Košarkaški klub Cibona featuring Drazen Petrovic for Europe. The Philippine NCC team lost to Cibona of Zagreb 111-86 in the first game and on the Second day lost to the Golden Eagles of the USA 81-73. In the third game, they lost by a solitary point against the Brazilians, 78-77. But in the Fourth game, the Philippine NCC team toppled the Italians by more than 19 points, 98-79. Reports from Girona said that the team won the hearts of the Spanish basketball fans as they saw the smallest basketball team in the World Cup for Champion Clubs play competitively against taller opponents from Europe and America. Ron Jacobs later admitted that he did not instill in his players' minds to give their best for the World Cup for Champion Clubs, as they treated the tournament as just part of their preparation for the coming Asian Basketball Confederation Championships.\nIn 1985, an even bigger victory came in the William Jones Cup in Taiwan. Ranked 4th overall, the Philippine team wasn't expected to do well, especially since the Americans were represented by solid NCAA Division I players like Harold Pressley, Joe Wolf, Kenny Gattison, Kevin Henderson, Jay Bilas and Tommy Amaker and coached by Purdue's Gene Keady, fresh from being awarded 1984 NCAA national coach of the year and Big 10 Coach of the year. Keady was assisted on the bench by Bruce Weber, his assistant at Purdue that would later become a decorated coach himself. But Jacobs' boys pulled off one surprise after another as Moore worked like a horse, Engelland was at his pinpoint accuracy best, Calma was at his prime handling the court generalship role, and the tandem of Samboy Lim and Allan Caidic doing wonders both inside and outside. In the finals, the team found itself to be in a dilemma, as center Dennis Still was hobbled by a bum knee while Jeff Moore encountered some back problems. But showing true guts and courage, the two players overcame the odds, and, with Engelland sniping away from the outside with 42 points and Lim, Caidic and Franz Pumaren doing equal damage from the arc, the SMB team won against the Americans overtime of the final, 108-100. Tommy Amaker didn't know what hit him - he was astonished how Calma outran and outfoxed him all throughout the game. It came to a point when the foreign press described Calma as the \"point guard whiz\" from the Philippines while being astonished by Samboy Lim's high-flying and daredevil ways. Jacobs in an interview said \"I thought the American team that beat us in the Interclub World Tourney was weaker than the American team we beat in the Jones Cup finals\". In saying those words, Jacobs meant that they could have won two successive trophies if only they treated the World Interclub tourney seriously.\nWith the momentum on their side, Jacobs' team their last pre-ABC tournament in the Philippine Basketball Association's Reinforced Conference, with each team featuring one import with a maximum height of 6'5. In one semifinals tiff held at the ULTRA, Jacobs' went up against Robert Jaworski's Ginebra San Miguel in what may be considered as one of the best PBA games of all time. Ginebra lost Robert Jaworski via a busted lip midway in the second quarter on account of a wayward elbow from Moore that forced him to rush to the emergency room of the nearby Medical City in Pasig. Given up for lost, the Philippine team ran roughshod against the Gins minus their leader. When Jaworski came back to the coliseum with less than 8 minutes left in the 4th canto, the crowd erupted seeing the Big J with a bandage on his upper lip. The Big J entered the game, his team behind 15 points. The crowd was already in a frenzy by then, and every Ginebra shot was punctuated by heavy cheering matched only by every NCC missed shot. The game ended with Ginebra winning and Jacobs shaking his head in disbelief.\nHowever, this did not stop Jacobs' wards in their drive for the championship. Having topped the semifinals round, they earned the first seat in the finals and waited for the winner of the Manila Beer-Ginebra series. They dethroned Great Taste Coffee in the semifinals. Jacobs secretly longed to have Manila Beer in the finals, knowing fully well how difficult to go up against a Ginebra team with the crowd behind them. Similarly, Jacobs had difficulty finding an antidote to Michael Hackett, unlike Manila Beer's Francois Wise who Still can dominate one-on-one. Manila Beer beat Ginebra in sudden death to barge into the finals. It was a rout - Jacobs led a 4-0 sweep, including a 32-point victory in the last game, 138-106 - regarded as the most lopsided finals ever in PBA history.\nIn December 1985, the ABC Championship was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with the Philippines as favorites to win the championship alongside China. In the semifinals, the Philippine team demolished China to earn the right to meet South Korea in the finals. The team finally regained its ABC Championship, last won in 1973 when the tournament was in Manila, on January 5, 1986, with Samboy Lim and Allan Caidic leading in the scoring end.\nAs early as 1985, Jacobs was already mapping out a grand plan to ensure continuity with his system. Knowing fully well that Still and Moore were already in their 30s, he eyed Benjie Paras and Alvin Patrimonio to take over the slots left by Still and Moore. Engelland, on the other hand, was relatively younger and was already honing Allan Caidic, Naning Valenciano and Pido Jarencio's shooting skills. Jacobs was also expecting Jojo Lastimosa to take over the slot to be vacated by Engelland in the future.\nThen the People Power Revolution took place in February 1986 that forced the departure of Cojuangco. Jacobs suddenly found himself without a job as the BAP under Puyat regained control of Philippine basketball fiefdom. Jacobs left for the US but later returned sometime in 1994.\nPBA (1994-2002).\nIn the 1994 Asian Games held in Hiroshima, the Philippine national team was composed mainly of players from the 1994 PBA All-Filipino champions San Miguel Beer. Coach Norman Black backstopped a team featuring Allan Caidic, Ato Agustin, Dong Polistico, Alvin Teng, Hector Calma plus three players from Purefoods (Alvin Patrimonio, Jerry Codinera, Rey Evangelista), 1 player from Alaska (Johnny Abarrientos) and 2 topnotch amateurs (Marlou Aquino and Kenneth Duremdes). Jacobs was sent by Cojuangco to provide advice to Black. Jacobs was seen in one game in the semifinals, where Jacobs and Quinito Henson almost came to blows with Norman Black as the latter despised the two's incessant interference in his coaching. Eventually, this team ended up 4th place and out of the medal race in the tournament.\nBlack was then eased out of the San Miguel Beer bench to give way to Jacobs, who was given the reins in 1997. Jacobs handled a moribund San Miguel team that had only Nelson Asaytono as his offensive weapon. In that only season as head coach, Jacobs piloted SMB to two third-place finishes - an outstanding feat especially considering the lineup that the Beermen possessed.\nIn 1998, the Basketball Coaches Association of the Philippines (BCAP) under Chito Narvasa petitioned to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) that Ron Jacobs had no right to coach a PBA team, being a foreigner. The DOLE agreed and Jacobs was made a consultant and gave the coaching job to his protege Jong Uichico. A few weeks after, Jacobs was being contemplated upon by then PBA Commissioner Jun Bernardino to handle the 1998 Centennial team that was tasked to win the gold at the 1998 Asian Games in Thailand. Again, the BCAP stepped in and protested Jacobs' pending appointment. Bernardino instead appointed Alaska coach Tim Cone to handle the reins of the national team, who copped a bronze medal.\nIn 2000, Jacobs later served as an assistant coach of Ginebra.\nPhilippine men's national team (2002).\nIn 2002, Bernardino formally appointed Jacobs to handle the national team to play in the 2002 Asian Games. Armed with a blueprint designed to earn the gold medal, Jacobs proposed having two national team selections made up of 24 of the most outstanding PBA players to go up against PBA teams with import reinforcements. While many questioned Jacobs' preference to play in the PBA (which was to revert to amateur rules during the time), no one doubted what Jacobs had in mind for he was the only one who understood what he was doing. But Jacobs suffered a near-fatal stroke, and the coaching mantle was eventually turned over to Uichico who was earlier appointed as Jacobs' chief second and scout. The fourth place standing in the Asian Games ended up as being one of the biggest disappointments in Philippine sports in year 2002.\nProtégés.\nToday, several of Jacobs disciples are coaching or occupying front office jobs in Philippine basketball:\nLater life and death.\nOn December 22, 2001, Jacobs suffered a stroke while driving home to his apartment in Pasig. Jacobs became bedridden, unable to speak and walk. For the remainder of his life, he continued to live in the Philippines with his wife, Menen.\nJacobs died on the evening of December 24, 2015, in Makati, three days short of his 73rd birthday from complications of the stroke he suffered 14 years prior."

He played college football for the University of Oregon and professional football for the Portsmouth Spartans (1931–1933) and their successor, the Detroit Lions (1934–1938). He later formed the Christensen Diamond Products Company, which became a publicly traded company manufacturing industrial, drilling and military equipment with plants in Europe, Asia, South America and North America.\nEarly years.\nChristensen was born in Pendleton, Oregon in 1909. He attended Pendleton Prep and Aberdeen Prep before enrolling at the University of Oregon. He played college football as a tackle for the Oregon Ducks from 1928 to 1930. At the end of the 1930 season, Christensen was selected as an All-Pacific Coast player. He also played for the Western All-Stars in the annual East-West Shrine Game.\nProfessional football.\nChristensen played professional football in the National Football League for eight years for the Portsmouth Spartans (1931–1933) and the Detroit Lions (1934–1938). He started in 74 of 95 games that he played. He was selected as a first-team All-NFL player in 1931, 1933, 1934 and 1936, and a second-team All-NFL player in 1932 and 1935. He was also the captain of the first Detroit Lions professional football team in 1934 and was a starter on the 1935 Detroit Lions team that won the 1935 NFL Championship Game. Teammate Glenn Presnell recalled, \"George Christensen was a good tackle, he weighed about 230 and was the biggest man on the team.\"\nIn 1969, the Associated Press selected all-decade teams to commemorate the NFL's 30th anniversary. Christensen was named as one of five tackles on the All-1930s teams.\nIn July 1939, Christensen was hired as the line coach for the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nChristensen is one of ten players that were named to the National Football League 1930s All-Decade Team that have not been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nChristensen Diamond Products.\nAfter retiring from football, Christensen became employed by Koebel Diamond tools, which sold diamond tools to the automotive companies in Detroit.\nIn 1944, Christensen went into business with his former teammate, Frank Christensen, to whom he was not related. The two men began manufacturing diamond bits as the Christensen Diamond Products Company in Salt Lake City. George was responsible for procuring diamonds for the business, eventually negotiating a direct allocation from the DeBeers diamond syndicate.\nIn 1946, the company introduced diamond core bits to the mining industry. The company had a technological breakthrough in the late 1940s when it perfected a tungsten carbide matrix for diamond bits at an oil field in Colorado. The two men also formed Christensen Machine Company, which later became Hughes Christensen, to manufacture precision tools and gauges for military ordnance and radar. In 1957 Christensen Diamond Products opened a manufacturing plant in Celle, West Germany to serve international\nmarkets. Eventually, the Christensens' operations became international with manufacturing plants in Canada, France, Germany, and Japan.\nDeath.\nIn 1968, he died at his home in Colorado of a heart attack at age 58."

        "text": "The 2009 Ashes series was that year's edition of the long-standing and storied cricket rivalry between England and Australia, and was part of the Australian cricket tour of England in 2009. Starting on 8 July 2009, England and Australia played five Tests, with England winning the series 2–1. England thus reclaimed The Ashes from Australia, who had won the previous series in 2006–07. Andrew Strauss became just the second England captain in 20 years, alongside Michael Vaughan in 2005, to win the Ashes.\nThe first Test was held at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, the first Test match ever to be held at the ground, and resulted in England saving a draw with one wicket to spare, and Ricky Ponting surpassing 11,000 Test runs, becoming Australia's leading Test run scorer as the series progressed. The second Test at Lord's was preceded by the announcement that Andrew Flintoff would be retiring from Test cricket at the end of the series. The England all-rounder then took his first Lord's five-for to seal a 115-run victory, England's first against Australia at the ground in 75 years. Rain prevented play for large amounts of the Third Test at Edgbaston, including the entire third day, making the draw an inevitable result. Australia pegged the score back to 1–1 with an innings victory at Headingley after bowling out England for 102, their lowest Ashes total since they were bowled out for 77 at Lord's in 1997. This left the Fifth Test at The Oval to decide the series.\nAustralia began the match needing only a draw to retain the Ashes, but an inspired bowling performance from Stuart Broad to remove Australia for just 160 runs, and a maiden Test century for Jonathan Trott in England's second innings left Australia chasing 546 with two days left to play. An innings of 121 from Michael Hussey gave the Australians hope, but he gradually ran out of partners before losing his own wicket to give England a 197-run win in the match and a 2–1 series victory.\nBackground.\nThe 2009 Ashes series began with Australia leading by 31 series to 27, with five drawn series. Australia had won nine of the last 10 Ashes series, including winning the most recent series 5–0 in 2006–07, but the 2005 series, the last to be held in England, was won 2–1 by the home side.\nAustralia's last two Test series before the Ashes were played against South Africa, the first in Australia and the second in South Africa. Although South Africa won their tour series 2–1, Australia recovered to win the return series by the same scoreline.\nMeanwhile, England warmed up for the 2009 Ashes with two Test series against the West Indies, the first in the West Indies and the second in England. The first series comprised five matches and was won 1–0 by the West Indies, but the second only included two Tests, England winning both.\nThe immediate preparation for the Ashes consisted of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, held in England in June 2009. Australia struggled in their group, losing to the West Indies and Sri Lanka by seven and six wickets, respectively, and were eliminated at the first hurdle. England also suffered a shock four-wicket defeat to the Netherlands in their first match, but they recovered by defeating Pakistan by 48 runs to qualify for the Super Eights. There, they were paired with South Africa, India and the West Indies, but defeat to South Africa and a narrow victory over India meant that they needed a victory against the West Indies to reach the semi-finals. They lost the match via the Duckworth–Lewis method, and were eliminated.\nAustralia completed their Ashes preparations with tour matches against Sussex and the England Lions, but both matches finished as draws. Meanwhile, England's schedule was completed with a draw against Warwickshire.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nEngland won the toss and captain Andrew Strauss chose to bat. England slumped to 90/3 early but recovered with a fine partnership of 138 runs between Pietersen and Collingwood. Hauritz dismissed Pietersen for the crucial fifth wicket when he offered a simple catch to short leg, attempting to sweep from outside the off stump. England ended the day at 336/7 after Siddle picked up two crucial wickets in the last four overs of play.\nSwann's unbeaten 47 off 40 balls took England to 435. Australia's openers started brightly facing eight overs before lunch. Flintoff, the fastest bowler in the match, captured the only wicket when Hughes' bottom-edge was well caught by Prior. Katich and Ponting steadily took control with sensible batting. Ponting reached a major milestone in his career scoring his 11,000th run and joining Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara and Allan Border. By the end of the day both batsmen had scored centuries, Katich's first against England and their unbeaten partnership of 189 runs had Australia at 249/1 at stumps.\nKatich and Ponting added 50 runs to the overnight total before their partnership was broken by Anderson who had been given the new ball earlier. Anderson collected his second wicket of the day (Hussey) when Prior took an easy catch. Ponting was soon to follow, chopping the ball onto his stumps as he attempted a cut shot off Panesar's bowling. After lunch, Australia consolidated their position without losing a wicket and passing England's total and at tea were 458/4. Play was delayed unexpectedly for two hours due to rain and when play resumed it was under lights – the first time artificial light was used in a Test Match in Britain. At stumps Australia were in a strong position with 5 wickets in hand and a lead of 44 runs.\nResuming in fairly muggy, heavy clouded conditions North and Haddin punished the English attack. North reached his deserved century scoring centuries on both his Test and Ashes debuts. At lunch Australia had reached 577/5. After lunch, Haddin became the destroyer-in-chief, flicking three successive Anderson deliveries to the boundary and closed in on his second Test ton with booming sixes off the ineffective English attack. When Haddin was finally dismissed, Ponting declared the Australian innings at 674/6, the largest total against England since 1934 and fourth highest in The Ashes series. In the short time before tea England failed miserably to hold on, losing Cook and Bopara. The rain started as tea was taken and play ended for the day with England 219 runs behind and in dire straits to save the match.\nResuming on 20/2, England lost three wickets in the first 90 minutes of play and reached lunch on 102/5. Paul Collingwood lasted 245 balls and batted for five hours and 43 minutes before being caught at gully by Michael Hussey. The last man partnership of James Anderson and Monty Panesar managed to bat England into a lead. With every dot ball cheered, England managed to bat until 18:40 to secure a draw. Australia captain Ricky Ponting later accused the England team of time-wasting by allowing their 12th man, Bilal Shafayat, and physiotherapist, Steve McCaig, to twice run onto the pitch.\nSecond Test.\nEngland started the day with the news that former captain and talisman Andrew Flintoff was going to retire from Test cricket after the Ashes, Monty Panesar had been dropped in favour of Graham Onions and Steve Harmison had been left out of the squad. England won the toss and chose to bat first. They started exceptionally well with Strauss and Cook opening and going in for lunch 126/0. There was bad luck for the Australians after the interval when Strauss hit a ball back towards bowler Nathan Hauritz who, in trying to take the catch, dislocated his finger. England's pre-lunch form continued into the afternoon, until, with the score 196/0, Cook was dismissed LBW by Johnson just short of his century on 95. England soon lost Bopara for 18 and, from 222/2, England started to collapse: the next four middle order batsmen fell for just 74 with Australia's bowlers looking far better than they had done earlier in the day. Strauss continued past 150 to reach 161 with Broad on 7 going into day 2 and England on a possible shaky 364/6.\nEngland started the way they had finished on day 1 – with fast wickets for few runs. Strauss was eventually bowled out on his second ball of the day for his previous day's total of 161. After that, two quick wickets meant that England were on 378 with only one wicket left. Onions and Anderson started slowly but gathered confidence with a partnership of 47 until Anderson was caught by Hussey ending England's innings on 425 all-out. The Australians had just under an hour before lunch and James Anderson claimed two wickets with the crucial wicket of Ricky Ponting. A 93 run partnership seemed to have the Australians back in the game but 6 wickets for 53 runs put England into a very strong position going into day 3 with Hauritz and Siddle on 3* each.\nHaving bowled Australia out for 215, England decided not to enforce the follow on. In England's 2nd Innings, openers Strauss and Cook started brightly as they looked to score quick runs to increase their lead in the match. After reaching 32 in 42 balls, Cook was trapped LBW by spinner Nathan Hauritz while England were on 61. Strauss fared little better against Hauritz and was out against him shortly afterwards by a catch from Michael Clarke. These two wickets brought Bopara and Pietersen to the crease and also signalled a slowing of the run rate. This partnership lasted 28 overs when Hauritz, showing few ill-effects from his dislocated middle finger on Day 1, got another England wicket. Simon Katich caught Bopara for 27 from 93 balls. When Pietersen fell 7 overs later, caught behind to Siddle, the score 174 for 4. It was left to Collingwood and wicketkeeper Prior to accelerate the run-rate for England. Matt Prior in particular enjoyed success hitting a quick-fire 61 off 42 balls (an innings which included 9 boundaries) until he was dismissed run out by a quick piece of fielding from Marcus North. Upon Prior's dismissal came Andrew Flintoff, playing in his last test for England at Lord's. Flintoff with Collingwood made a fifty partnership in 8 overs with Collingwood reaching his half-century. When Collingwood was dismissed caught behind off Siddle, Stuart Broad came on as next batsman but failed to face a ball as the umpires stopped play due to rain. Almost immediately afterwards, heavy showers meant that play was abandoned for the day with England 311 for 6, a lead over Australia of 521.\nPlay was delayed due to early showers until 11:15. Andrew Strauss immediately declared England's second innings closed on 311 for 6, leaving Australia a target of 522 to win in two days of play. England started strongly, reducing Australia to 128/5, but a counter-attack by Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin brought Australia back into the game, reaching 313/5 at the close of play, with an outside chance of reaching the target of 522. The highest total ever to have been reached by a test side in the fourth innings to win was 418 (West Indies vs Australia, 2002–03 at St John's).\nRequiring another 209 runs to win, Australia hopes were high with Michael Clarke on 136 and Brad Haddin on 80. England broke the partnership early when Andrew Flintoff made Haddin edge one to Paul Collingwood. Graeme Swann then bowled Clarke with his first ball of the day, and Flintoff then bowled both Nathan Hauritz and Peter Siddle to claim his first five-wicket-haul at Lord's, on his final appearance as a Test player at the ground. The feat also meant he became one of the few players to grace \"both\" Lord's Honours Boards (because of the 142 he made against South Africa six years prior). With only one wicket left, Mitchell Johnson aggressively powered to 63 before he was clean-bowled by Swann to wrap up England's first Ashes Test victory at Lord's since 1934 at 12:42.\nThird Test.\nAustralia chose to bat first after winning the toss. Play began at 17:00 after a long rain delay. At the start of the day, Australian opener Phillip Hughes announced via his Twitter page that he had been dropped from the side. His replacement, all-rounder Shane Watson, put on 85 runs for the first wicket with Simon Katich before Katich was trapped LBW in Graeme Swann's first over. Over the course of the day's 30 overs, Watson accrued 62 runs not out as Australia finished the day at 126/1.\nEngland started the day in fine form as Graham Onions removed Shane Watson and Michael Hussey with the first two balls of the day, before taking the wicket of Ricky Ponting soon after as the Australian captain tried to hook a quick bouncer. The Australians only added another 30 runs before James Anderson took the next wicket, sparking a sequence of four Anderson wickets in four overs for just 10 runs. Anderson and Onions shared the last two wickets between them as Nathan Hauritz and Ben Hilfenhaus put on 34 for the tenth wicket. England opened their innings with the momentum in their favour, but they had to face the same batting conditions as the Australians had, and Alastair Cook was removed for a duck in the second over. Ravi Bopara was the next to fall as he continued his poor run of form and put on just 23 runs. However, Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell batted until the end of the day to take England into the third day at 116/2.\nHeavy overnight rain left the pitch unplayable on Day 3. The umpires examined the pitch at 12:00 and 14:30, by which time large puddles had formed, forcing play to be abandoned for the day.\nThe fourth day began in the same fashion as the first three had: with a one-hour delay for rain. Play eventually got underway at 12:00, but the partnership only lasted another eight overs, as Strauss was caught behind by Graham Manou off Hilfenhaus. Collingwood was next to fall to Hilfenhaus, caught by Ponting at second slip with the last ball before lunch. Bell reached his half-century just after lunch, but was trapped LBW by Johnson five overs later. Matt Prior and Andrew Flintoff then developed a strong partnership, putting on 89 runs for the sixth wicket. Flintoff and Stuart Broad then combined for another 52 runs before Flintoff was caught out by a Nathan Hauritz ball that spat out of the rough and caught him on the glove. The last three wickets went for 66 runs, with Broad top-scoring with 55 to take England to 376 all out, 113 runs ahead of the Aussies. The Australian innings began well, with the openers putting on 47 runs before two quick wickets fell to Onions and Swann in consecutive overs: Katich edged Onions to Prior, and then Swann tormented Ponting before clean-bowling him with the last ball of his over. The day ended with Australia on 88/2.\nThe final day of the Third Test was the only day on which play began on schedule. Victory was a definite possibility for both sides, but England's 25-run lead gave them a slight advantage despite the time constraints. Australia drew level with England in the 10th over of the day, with both batsmen heading towards half-centuries. Watson was the first to reach 50, but was out off his next ball, edging the last ball of Anderson's first over of the day to Prior. Hussey was next to reach 50; however, he only put on 14 more before himself edging to Prior off Broad, in only Broad's second over of the innings. Australia's fifth-wicket partnership proved largely impenetrable for the remainder of the day, as Clarke and North pushed towards centuries and Australia towards a 200-run lead in the evening session. North looked the most likely to reach his century first, but – when still on 96 – he mistimed a drive that Anderson caught spectacularly at gully. Clarke then took another eight overs to reach his century with a four off Bopara, at which the two captains agreed to end the match as a draw.\nFourth Test.\nEngland won the toss and decided to bat first. However, within four overs they were already a wicket down as Andrew Strauss was caught for just three runs. He was then followed by Ravi Bopara (1), Ian Bell (8) and Paul Collingwood (0) before the end of the 19th over. Alastair Cook had managed to stay in throughout all this, but he was soon caught on 30 runs by Michael Clarke off Stuart Clark. After Cook's wicket, only Matt Prior offered any resistance, finishing the innings on 37 not out, while the five bowlers scored just six runs between them, three of them getting ducks. Although England responded well by getting Simon Katich out for a duck off series debutant Steve Harmison, the Australian innings began to gather pace and they were 69/1 off 15 overs by tea. The Australian second wicket partnership reached its century, but then three wickets came in relatively quick succession as Shane Watson fell for 51, Ricky Ponting for 78 and Michael Hussey for just 10 in the space of three overs. Australia finished the day on 196/4, with Michael Clarke on 34 and Marcus North on 7.\nResuming with a 94 run lead Clarke and North extended their partnership to 152 runs before it was broken by Graham Onions. After the lunch break, North continued with good support from the Australian tail and reached his century with a six. Clark was the best of the others with three sixes in his score of 32 (22 deliveries), and Australia finished with a total of 445. Stuart Broad recorded his best Test effort with figures of six wickets for 91 runs. The English openers started comfortably in the quest to erase the 343 run deficit. But just as it seemed they were in control, Ben Hilfenhaus struck twice in two balls, first removing Strauss with a ball that swung in subtly and then Bopara was dismissed for leg before, despite replays showing a deft inside edge onto his pad. Johnson produced a spell of left arm swing bowling that captured the prime wickets of Bell (3), Collingwood (4) and opener Cook. Nightwatchman Anderson was left with Prior at stumps with England in trouble at 82/5, still 261 runs behind Australia's total.\nHilfenhaus dismissed Anderson with the third ball of the third day, when the batsman nicked a short ball outside off stump and was caught at second slip by Ponting. It came the delivery after Anderson scored a 4. Prior and Broad added a further 34 runs before Hilfenhaus had Prior taken behind by a diving Haddin. Broad and Swann then took the attack to the Australian bowlers, at one point taking 47 off 2.4 overs. Their eighth-wicket partnership of 108 from 79 balls was the second-fastest century stand in Test history, behind Kiwis Nathan Astle and Chris Cairns against England in 2002 (118 from 65 balls). Broad was out with the score at 228/8 attempting to hit a boundary off a wide delivery from Johnson and was caught by Watson in the deep. After lunch, Harmison continued to frustrate the Australian bowlers with 19 from 28 deliveries, until Swann (62) and Onions (0) fell to Johnson, and the innings concluded after 61.3 overs at 263 to give Australia a victory by an innings and 80 runs.\nFifth Test.\nWith a 10-day break between the 4th and 5th Tests, England looked at their squad following their batting performances at Headingley. Many names were thrown up as possible replacements for the failing middle order of Bopara, Bell and Collingwood, including Jonathan Trott and Robert Key, as well as Mark Ramprakash, whose last test came in 2002, and Marcus Trescothick, who then ruled himself out of the running. The fitness of Andrew Flintoff was also questioned, as many commentators said that he would have to play if England were to win the Test. Flintoff remained in the squad, the only change being the introduction of Trott for Bopara, with the confirmation that the South African-born batsman would make his Test debut at The Oval.\nEngland won the toss and captain Andrew Strauss chose to bat on a pitch quite uncharacteristic of what would be considered normal at The Oval. Although they lost Alastair Cook to an outside edge off Peter Siddle early in the innings, England recovered to reach 108/1 at lunch, with Strauss making his fifty in just 89 balls. However, the captain put on just five more after the break before being caught behind by wicket-keeper Brad Haddin. The next two wickets fell to Siddle in relatively quick succession: Paul Collingwood was caught at mid-on by Michael Hussey, before Ian Bell – who had reached his half-century off 73 balls – inside-edged onto his own stumps for 72. In came debutant Jonathan Trott, who took 12 balls to open his Test scoring tally, and continued to score slowly as he lost partners in Matt Prior and Andrew Flintoff, who made just seven runs in the first innings of his final Test match to take England to 247/6. Trott himself was next to fall, run out by Simon Katich: Trott clipped the ball to the leg side, but Katich made a smart stop and, with just one to aim at, threw the ball at the stumps, catching Trott well out of his ground. The eighth wicket stood for another 39 runs, when Graeme Swann was caught behind off Siddle for the Australian's fourth wicket of the innings, and with that play was closed for the day with England at 307/8.\nEngland added just 25 more runs for their last two wickets at the start of Day 2, Hilfenhaus trapping Anderson LBW for 0 in the second over of the day (ending his 54 innings sequence without a duck), before dismissing Broad for 37. Shane Watson and Simon Katich took Australia to 66/0 before rain forced lunch to be taken three minutes early, with the resumption of play delayed until almost 14:30. After lunch the Australian openers lasted just two overs before the start of a massive Broad-inspired batting collapse. First to fall was Watson, LBW on 34, then Ricky Ponting was deceived by a cutter from Broad and played onto his own stumps for just eight runs. Michaels Hussey and Clarke were next to go, Hussey LBW for a duck, before Clarke was caught low at short extra cover by Jonathan Trott. After a spell in which Broad took four wickets for just eight runs, Swann returned to the attack and immediately took the wicket of Marcus North, although replays subsequently showed that the Australian number 6 got an inside edge to the ball before it struck his pad. Katich reached his half-century in the 37th over of the innings, but was out the very next ball, caught by Alastair Cook at short leg. Broad completed his five-wicket haul in the 39th over, bowling Brad Haddin to give him wicket-to-wicket figures of 5/19 and leave only the Australian bowlers to dismiss. Swann took the next two wickets – albeit that of Stuart Clark was given incorrectly – leaving it to Flintoff to bowl Hilfenhaus and end the Australian innings for 160 runs. The English openers returned to the crease and put on 27 before Cook edged North to first slip for just nine. Mitchell Johnson then combined well with Simon Katich at short leg for the next two wickets, Katich catching Bell low before Johnson thumped a bouncer into Collingwood, looping the ball up for Katich to catch easily, leaving the home side at 39/3. Nevertheless, Strauss and Trott recovered well to take England into the third day at 58/3.\nStrauss and Trott built a partnership of 118 before the England captain edged to Michael Clarke at first slip just before the lunch break on day three. With the final ball of the morning session, Prior drove a ball from North to the off side and hit Ricky Ponting at silly point square in the jaw. The Australian captain, looked nonplussed, simply spat out some blood. After lunch, Prior was run out while attempting to sneak a run, despite hitting the ball straight to Katich, who threw down the stumps at the bowler's end. The next man in was Andrew Flintoff, playing in his final Test innings, and he added 22 off 18 before being caught on the long-on boundary. A lofted straight drive from England's most promising all-round prospect, Stuart Broad, brought up the 400 lead, but an attempted slog found his top edge and he was caught by Ponting off North for 29. Meanwhile, Trott progressed towards his maiden Test century, ably supported by Graeme Swann, who reached his half-century in just 44 balls. However, the England spinner was eventually caught behind, top-edging a pull shot off a bouncer from Hilfenhaus. Trott then became the 18th England cricketer to make a century on debut with a four off Hilfenhaus's next over, but he and Anderson only managed to add another 31 before Trott was caught by North at point off Stuart Clark, prompting a declaration from Andrew Strauss. England's score of 373/9 declared meant that in order to win the match Australia would need to make 546 runs in just over two days on a pitch that had not yet produced more than 400 over the course of the match. England, on the other hand, needed only to take 10 Australian wickets. The Australian openers managed to get to 80 without loss by the end of play.\nStarting the day at 80/0, Australia lost both Simon Katich and Shane Watson LBW in quick succession within the first five overs. Ponting and Hussey then built an impressive partnership, sharing a stand of 127 runs before Ponting was run out by a direct hit from Andrew Flintoff fielding at mid-off, which marked an important turning point in the match. Michael Clarke was then run out in the very next over following some sharp fielding from Andrew Strauss at slip, while Marcus North was next to go when he left his ground to reach for a Graeme Swann delivery but missed, allowing keeper Matt Prior to stump him before he could get back. Hussey and Haddin steadied the innings as Hussey reached his first century in 28 Test innings after earlier being dropped by Paul Collingwood on 55, but Haddin was eventually out for 34 attempting a big shot over mid-wicket, where he was caught in the deep by Strauss. Harmison took the wicket of Mitchell Johnson for a duck in the next over, and then removed Siddle and Clark in consecutive balls. Hilfenhaus survived the hat-trick ball, but the match only lasted another two overs as Hussey was caught by Cook at short leg off the bowling of Swann. England won the match by 197 runs, to claim a 2–1 series win."

        "title": "Joe Fortunato (American football)",
        "text": "Joseph Francis Fortunato (March 28, 1930 – November 6, 2017) was an American professional football player who spent his entire 12-year National Football League (NFL) career playing linebacker for the Chicago Bears. A five-time Pro Bowl selection, he was the captain and signal-caller for the Bears defense, leading to an NFL Championship in 1963. Fortunato is one of only four players, and the only defensive player named to the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team who has not yet been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPrior to the NFL, Fortunato played fullback and linebacker for Mississippi State University, and made All-American in 1951.\nEarly life.\nFortunato was born on March 28, 1930, in Mingo Junction, Ohio. He worked in his grandparents’ grocery store as a child and in the steel mill as a teen.\nCollege career.\nVMI.\nFortunato initially attended Virginia Military Institute (VMI) where he was a member of the VMI Keydets football team in 1949.\nMississippi State University.\nIn 1950, he transferred to Mississippi State College—now known as Mississippi State University, reuniting him with head coach Slick Morton who was previously the head coach at VMI. He played both fullback and linebacker since college football had reverted to primarily single-platoon football, meaning those players that were on offense had to switch to defense, and vice versa, when ball possession changed.\nAs a junior in 1951, Fortunato was tabbed first-team All-American and first-team All-SEC.\nIn his senior season, he was selected honorable mention All-American and All-SEC after leading the Bulldogs with 779 rushing yards and five touchdowns. He became one of the first Bulldogs to rush for over 1,000 yards in a career, scoring six total touchdowns and registering four interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nFortunato was selected in the seventh round of the 1952 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, 80th overall. He did not join the Bears until the 1955 season due to a military commitment. He became a full-time starter during his rookie season under Hall of Fame coach and team owner George Halas.\nTogether with fellow linebackers Bill George and Larry Morris, Fortunato formed the Bears' greatest linebacker threesome of all-time. However, after a disappointing season in which the team finished 8-4 and missed the playoffs, Halas decided to step down as head coach.\nIn February 1956, former Bears quarterback and Hall of Famer, Paddy Driscoll was hired by Halas as his successor as head coach. Driscoll lead the Bears to the NFL Western Division a 9-2-1 record, which was tied for best in the league that year. The Bears lost to the New York Giants in the 1956 NFL Championship game. The 47-7 loss in that game, coupled with a 5-7 season the following year, compelled Halas to reassign Driscoll and return as head coach in February 1958.\nUnder Halas's leadership, the Bears rebounded by finishing with an 8-4 record in both 1958 and 1959. The Bears continued to win at least eight games in 1960, 1961, and 1962, but missed the playoffs in six consecutive seasons. During the latter stages of the 1962 season, George Allen replaced veteran Clark Shaughnessy as Halas' top defensive assistant, effectively making him the Bears' defensive coordinator.\nAllen's presence had a formative effect and in 1963, Fortunato guided the Bears league-leading defense (as captain and signal-caller) in scoring, total, rushing and passing as well as turnovers. After the Bears won the 1963 NFL championship, Fortunato stood on a chair in the locker room and delivered a short speech on Allen’s importance to the team and tossed him the game ball.\nFortunato led the Bears in tackles for seven consecutive seasons. In addition to his 16 career interceptions, Fortunato also recovered 22 fumbles, which was an NFL record at the time of his retirement. The record stood until Bears teammate Dick Butkus passed him.\nDuring his career, Fortunato played in 155 of 156 possible games, starting 153. The Bears had eight winning seasons in his 12 years.\nCoaching career.\nA knee injury ended Fortunato's playing career shortly before the 1967 NFL season. He stayed on with the Bears as an assistant coach, leading the linebackers in Halas' final season as head coach. He became defensive coordinator after Jim Dooley was elevated to Bears head coach prior to the 1968 season.\nPersonal life.\nHe left the Bears after one year as defensive coordinator and made his home in Natchez, Mississippi. He owned and operated Big Joe Oil Company, which explored for and drilled wells. He became known for his charity work in Mingo Junction, where a highway was named after him, and Natchez, where he started the Joe Fortunato Celebrity Golf Classic to raise funds for education in Mississippi.\nHe was a recreational bluegill fisherman.\nAwards and recognition.\nFortunato played 12 seasons for the Bears (1955–1966), where he served as team captain. He made the Pro Bowl five times, and was named to the NFL 300 Greatest Players team.\nFortunato was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1978 and the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1990.\nIn 2017, he was added to Mississippi State University's Ring of Honor on Davis Wade Stadium, which is the highest recognition for Mississippi State Football. He was the seventh Bulldog selected for that honor, following Johnie Cooks, Jack Cristil, Kent Hull, D.D. Lewis, Shorty McWilliams and Jackie Parker.\nAlso in 2017, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Fortunato to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2017.\nHe was a recipient of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) HEROES award in 2000 for his founding of the Joe Fortunato Celebrity Golf Classic.\nDeath.\nFortunato died on November 6, 2017. Upon his passing, Bears Chairman George McCaskey issued a statement acknowledging that Fortunato \"was a key figure in one of the greatest linebacker trios in Bears history alongside Hall of Famers Bill George and Larry Morris.\""

        "title": "Sailing at the 1936 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Sailing/Yachting is an Olympic sport starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule. The Sailing program of 1936 consisted of a total of four sailing classes (disciplines). For each class seven races were scheduled from 29 August 1936 to 8 September 1936 at the Firth of Kiel.\nVenue.\nFor the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics a choice had to be made between the Berliner Müggel Lake district or the Kiel area. Finally the Organizing committee made the decision in favour of the big boats and picked Kiel.\nAs a result of the distance between Berlin to Kiel, a special committee for Yachting sprung to life to assist the Organizing Committee for the XIth Olympiad. Since Kiel was mainly a military port this committee had to cooperate not only with the local authorities but also with the German Fleet Command in Kiel to ensure the success of the races.\nCourse areas and courses.\nOne race area was created to the East of Schilksee and two in the harbor area more into the Firth of Kiel. Near the course areas tribunes on barges and on land were placed for spectators.\nThe sailing was done on the triangular type Olympic courses. The start was made in the center of a set of 8 numbered marks that were places in a circle. This made it possible to begin and finish every race sailing against the wind, regardless of the direction of the wind. During the starting procedure the sequence of the marks was communicated to the sailors. Starting upwind ensure a fair start of every race. This mark system is, at least in certain German lakes, still in use in many places.\nThe German Navy, was besides the organization of the race management responsible, with the help of the shipping lines, for keeping the race areas free of undesirable traffic.\nMedal summary.\nSource:\nOther information.\nSailors.\nDuring the sailing regattas at the 1936 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:"

In 2000, the Tier IV Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tournaments of Beijing was moved to Shanghai, allowing the city to hold both the ATP event, now part of the International Series, and the WTA event.\nIn 2004, as the ATP was increasing its presence in Asia, having brought the Tennis Masters Cup to Shanghai in 2002, working on moving several events to different new locations, the ATP and WTA Shanghai tournaments were both relocated, with the women's, now a Tier II tournament, returning to Beijing, and the men's moving to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. After the 2005 edition, the tournament moved once more to a new country, in India, taking place in the city of Mumbai first, in 2006 and 2007, and then moving again to Bangalore for the 2008 edition. The first event to be held in the new location, though, was cancelled due to security fears, and the first Bangalore Open consequently postponed to the next season. In 2009 a new tournament in Asia was created to replace it, the Malaysian Open, located on Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."

        "text": "John Bradshaw Butler (November 12, 1927 – May 11, 2013) was an American professional football player who was a cornerback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). In 2012, he was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nButler was an undrafted free agent whom the Pittsburgh Steelers brought onto their roster in 1951 based on a recommendation that Art Rooney Sr. received from his brother Silas Rooney, who was a priest serving as athletic director at St. Bonaventure University. Butler would become a defensive back and occasional wide receiver for the Steelers.\nAs a rookie, Butler intercepted five passes for 142 yards. In 1953, he had nine interceptions and returned two of them for touchdowns. Four interceptions came in a game against the Washington Redskins on December 13, 1953. One of the interceptions resulted in a 35-yard return for a touchdown to win the game for the Steelers 14-13. The following year Butler set a record with two interception returns for touchdowns. In 1957, he led the league in interceptions with a career-best 10.\nOffensively, Butler scored a touchdown against the New York Giants. It was late in the game and Butler had caught the game-winning touchdown pass from Jim Finks.\nIn 1958, Butler added nine more interceptions to his growing list. During the 1959 season after garnering two interceptions, Butler was forced to retire due to a leg injury he received when tight end Pete Retzlaff of the Philadelphia Eagles rolled into Butler's knee.\nButler never made more than around $12,000 as a player with the Steelers. Following his playing career, Butler spent 46 years with the BLESTO Scouting Combine (44 as its director). During this time, his contributions to the NFL included scouting and evaluating over 75,000 college athletes and starting the Combine scouting process that is still in use today.\nButler was named to four straight Pro Bowls from 1956 to 1959. He had 52 interceptions during his career and 865 yards. At the time of his retirement in 1959, Jack tied for first with Safety Bobby Dillon in career interceptions, garnering 52 in his 9-year career.\nIn 2004, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's second HOVG class. \nIn October 2008, Butler was named as one of the 33 Greatest Pittsburgh Steelers of all time. The Steelers named players to this team as part of their 75th anniversary season celebration. He was named to the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team.\nHe was named as a senior nominee for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for 2012 and was elected as a member on February 4, 2012.\nDeath.\nButler died at UPMC Shadyside in Pittsburgh on May 11, 2013. He was admitted for a staph infection around his artificial knee, a problem that almost killed him in 1959 and recurred every five to seven years since."

Since the sailing conditions of the coast near Seoul are not very suitable for Olympic sailing Busan was chosen for the 1988 Sailing event. \nA total of two race areas were created of the coast of Busan.\nBusan in Korea was reportedly a light wind venue but no one realised until too late that this information came from the airport which was located in a sheltered valley. It turned out to be that the 1988 Olympic Games were one of the windiest ever with one day of racing postponed due to too much wind. One day of racing saw around 30 knots of wind with 5 knots of current going against the wind. There was a lot of equipment damage and rescues for many classes resulting in many sailors did not finish and requests for redress.\nRemarks.\nSailing.\nFor the first time, a female-specific event, Women's 470, was on the program.

        "text": "Chris Mason (born 17 December 1969) is an English former professional darts player. He used the nickname Mace the Ace.\nBDO and first PDC spell.\nMason began his career in the British Darts Organisation, making his World Championship debut at the 1996 BDO World Championship. He lost 0–3 to Andy Fordham. After joining the World Darts Council in 1996, Mason competed in the 1996 World Matchplay, losing to Alan Warriner. In October 1996, Mason reached the final of the Sky Sports World Pairs partnered by Steve Raw, where they were narrowly beaten by Phil Taylor and Bob Anderson. Mason then competed in the 1997 WDC World Championship, where he lost 1–3 to Gerald Verrier and 0–3 to Taylor in the group stage.\nShortly after the BDO and PDC agreed the Tomlin Order in June 1997, some BDO players participated in the World Matchplay event between 1997 and 2001, and in the World Grand Prix event between 1998 and 2001. Mason went back to playing in the BDO World Championship after the Tomlin Order, but continued to play in other PDC televised majors outside of their World Championship. After a second round defeat in the BDO world championships in 1998, he went on to reach the semi-finals of the 1998 World Matchplay, narrowly losing 11–13 to Ronnie Baxter. The following year, Mason reached the quarter-finals of the 1999 World Matchplay, losing 11–16 to Taylor. Mason also reached the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix events in 1999 and 2000, losing to Peter Manley and Taylor respectively.\nMason enjoyed his best achievement in the 1999 BDO World Championship, when he recovered from 1–4 down in sets in his best-of-nine quarter-final match against Martin Adams, survived many match darts against him before eventually winning 5–4 in sets, winning by 6–4 in legs in the deciding set. This match is regarded as one of the best matches on television, and it included 29 180s between the players; 13 for Mason and 16 for Adams. He lost the semi-final 2–5 to reigning BDO World Champion, Raymond van Barneveld, three of those sets on deciding legs.\nMason avenged the defeat to van Barneveld the following year by beating van Barneveld 3–1 in the first round, averaging over 100. Mason also beat Fordham in the quarter-finals before losing 4–5 to Ted Hankey in the semi-finals, after leading 4–2. This match holds the 180 record for a 9 set match with 38 180's hit in the match, 16 of them from Mason, marking the second consecutive year that he had lost to the eventual champion in the semi-finals.\nMason's last appearance at Lakeside was a first round defeat to Mervyn King in 2001. He also reached the semi-final of the BDO's other major tournament, the Winmau World Masters in 2000, losing to the eventual champion, John Walton.\nMason hit the perfect 9 dart game in the last 32 stage of the Winmau World Masters, watched by good friend Bobby George, who said \"it was OK apart from the treble 19 wasn't quite in the middle\".\nPDC career.\nIn late 2001, the news came through that virtually all PDC televised tournaments would be closed off to players who did not play in the PDC World Darts Championship. As a result, Mason became one of the \"Skol Six\" who decided to play the PDC World Championship from 2002 onwards, so that they could continue to play in other PDC televised events.\nMason lost in the first round of the 2002 PDC World Championship to Dave Askew, but reached the quarter-finals in 2003 – losing to eventual champion, John Part. He missed most tournaments in 2003 and 2004 while he served a prison sentence – but he returned to play in the 2004 World Grand Prix in October, and reached the quarter-finals of the event for the third time, this time losing to Steve Beaton.\nMason has many titles to his name including the Irish Masters and the Vauxhall Pro Open on 3 occasions. Mason won the Irish Masters which was screened by Sky and also has lifted the Scottish Open and the English Open titles to his impressive résumé. Mason was Taylor's opposition at the 2002 World Matchplay when Taylor hit the first PDC nine-dart finish to be televised live on British screens.\nMason has reached the quarter-finals in a few other PDC events, including the 2005 UK Open, the 2006 Las Vegas Desert Classic, and the 2006 World Matchplay.\nRetirement.\nWhilst commentating on the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, on broadcaster ITV, Mason announced that he intended to retire from darts following the forthcoming qualifying rounds of the 2011 PDC World Championship, declaring that \"even if I do qualify, which is unlikely, the World Championships will be my swansong\". It was later announced by the PDC that he declined the opportunity of a Pro Tour Card for 2011, effectively confirming his decision – although he would be eligible to compete in qualifiers for Pro Tour event or switch to the BDO circuit instead. Chris has recently hinted that he may get back into darts but it would be a very professional job stating that he would begin to give 100% as he claimed he only gave 70% during his career.\n2012, out of retirement.\nIn January 2012, he entered the Professional Darts Corporation Pro Tour 'Q School' qualifying tournament. Over the four days Chris did not get a Tour Card but can play in all UK Open and European events as an associate member of the PDC.\nControversy.\nMason's personal life has been under much scrutiny. Mason was convicted of assault and assault with intent to resist arrest in March 1990 and sentenced to 180 hours community service. This was followed by a three-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months for actual bodily harm and, in August 1993, by three years' probation for assault causing actual bodily harm.\nPrison sentence.\nOn 14 April 2003, Mason and two friends Mark and Simon Gibson, were found guilty of aggravated burglary with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The victim of the attack, Poole scaffolder Neal Harley, was left with a broken nose, scalp cuts, facial swelling and bruising. The attack was sparked by a Yorkshire terrier dog named Doris which Mark Gibson had bought for Harley's fiancée Jane Graham while they were having a relationship some years earlier and had been \"hostile\" towards her new boyfriends. On 3 April 2002, Ms Graham had agreed to care for the dog but later returned it as it behaved too aggressively. Prosecutor, Mark Worsley, said that because of this Mark Gibson decided to confront Mr Harley and turned up that night with a hammer and his accomplices, saying: \"Come on boys, let's do him\". The Gibson brothers received five- and six-year sentences and Mason received a three-year sentence on 2 June 2003, but he served just over a year.\n2007 World championship.\nMason hit the headlines for criticising Phil Taylor in the newspapers before their last 16 match at the 2007 World Championship and allegedly swearing at him during the post-match handshake on-stage after Taylor beat him 4–0. He did apologise to Taylor after the tournament ended, but received a £750 fine and a four-month ban (suspended for 12 months) from the Darts Regulation Authority.\nBenefit fraud.\nIn June 2010, he was given a community order at Newcastle Magistrates Court for benefit fraud charges after he admitted to not declaring £45,000 of winnings between 2006 and 2007 while claiming benefits. He had been arrested whilst preparing to compete at the UK Open televised tournament.\nTelevision pundit.\nIn 2007, Mason became one of ITV's pundits on the inaugural Grand Slam of Darts, initially alongside the 1996 BDO World Champion, Steve Beaton, but since then by the 2001 World Grand Prix champion and 1993 World Championship runner-up, Alan Warriner-Little. It was ITV's return to broadcasting tournament darts after an absence of over a decade. Mason has remained a feature of ITV's darts coverage as a match summariser and co-commentator during ITV's coverage of the Grand Slam of Darts up to 2010, the European Championship, the Players Championship Finals, The Masters, as well as the UK Opens from 2014 onwards.\nPersonal life.\nMason took the decision to move from Kilkenny, Ireland to Stoke-on-Trent late in 2006. A few top players had made Stoke their home and Mason made the move partly so he could practice with Andy Hamilton. However, shortly after the World Championship Hamilton switched to practising with Taylor – who broke off from mentoring Adrian Lewis.\nMason is a supporter of football club Chelsea F.C."

A Country New South Wales representative , Cusack played his club football in Australasia's National Rugby League for the Sydney Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs, and in the Super League for Hull FC.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Young, New South Wales, Cusack was educated at St. Gregory's College in Campbelltown, New South Wales. He was discovered by Arthur Beetson during a game for their 1st team and trialed with the Sydney Roosters.\nPlaying career.\nCusack made his National Rugby League premiership début with the Sydney Roosters in the 1998 NRL season. A front-rower, Cusack was one of the last remaining top-level league players to hold a job outside football, working part-time as a plumber. He played in the 2000 NRL Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos. Cusack was awarded the 2002 Sydney Roosters season's \"Clubman of the Year\" and played in their 2002 NRL Grand Final victory over the New Zealand Warriors. He was also a member of the Roosters side that won the 2003 World Club Challenge, and appeared in the 2003 NRL Grand Final loss to the Penrith Panthers. Cusack played for the Roosters from the interchange bench in their 2004 NRL grand final loss to cross-Sydney rivals, Canterbury-Bankstown.\nIn 2005, Cusack joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs, that year winning the George Piggins Medal as the club's best and fairest player for the season. He served as a co-captain at the club, along with Roy Asotasi and David Kidwell.\nIn the 2006 NRL season, Cusack played 24 games as South Sydney finished last on the table. The season also saw Souths lose 66–0 against the New Zealand Warriors which is the club's worst ever defeat since entering the competition in 1908.\nIn November, 2007 Cusack signed to play in the Super League with English club Hull F.C. on a two-year contract.

        "title": "Manchester Rugby Club",
        "text": "Manchester Rugby Club, founded in 1860 as Manchester Football Club, is one of the oldest rugby union clubs in the world. Home matches are played at Grove Park in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport.\nThe club has a Senior Men's section (1st XV, 2nd XV and 3rd XV), a Senior Women and Youth Girls section (Manchester Women &amp; Girls' Academy), and also Minis, Juniors and Colts (Manchester Academy). The club's home colours are red and white narrow hooped shirts, white shorts and red and white hooped socks. Away colours are navy shirts with red piping, navy shorts and navy socks. The men's 1st XV currently play in Regional 1 North West, the fifth tier of the English rugby union system. The Women's 1st XV compete in Championship North 2, in the third tier of the English rugby union system.\nHistory.\nAlthough officially founded in 1860 as Manchester Football Club, a Manchester team actually first played in 1857, when the Gentlemen of Manchester and the Gentlemen of Liverpool came together to play a friendly game. Richard Sykes, a former Captain of Football at Rugby School set up the Manchester team and provided the ball. The game was advertised as \"Rugby versus the World\" and some fifty players arrived to play. There is no record of the score, however it appears that five tries were scored and so there must have been a winner.\nLiverpool FC, who later merged with St Helens RUFC to form Liverpool St. Helens F.C, came into being not long afterwards. It is not known why Manchester did not also form at this date but the Liverpool and St Helens clubs' merger in 1986 left Manchester as one of the oldest rugby clubs in the world.\nFrom 1919 until 1968 the club's home ground was at Moor Lane on Kersal Moor, now the home of Salford City F.C.\nManchester had very strong links with the early RFU, with two former presidents of MFC also taking the same office as President of the RFU (James MacLaren 1882-1884 and Roger Walker) 1894–1896. Other members who have been President of the RFU are J.W.H.Thorpe (1898-1900), James Milnes (1934), J.Reg.Locker (1967) and Dr.T.A.Kemp, MD, FRCP (1971). The club has provided a number of international players since 1871. The club provided four England players in the world's first ever international match against Scotland in 1871 (Richard Osborne, William MacLaren, Arthur Sumner Gibson and H.J.C. Turner). Another former player was Albert Neilson Hornby, the first ever player to captain England at both rugby and cricket. The earliest international jersey is still on display in the clubhouse. Andrew Bulteel and Ernest Marriott both played for England in the last 20 a-side match against Ireland in 1875. \nManchester FC were also the first recognised association football side in Manchester. In 1894 Newton Heath (present day Manchester United) were banned from changing their name to Manchester FC by the FA and RFU because of the existence of the rugby side. The full story of Manchester FC's association football history is detailed in \"Manchester A Football History\" where it is revealed they hold many Mancunian firsts. They were also the first English club side to play football competitively in Scotland when they faced Queen's Park F.C. in the second round of the FA Cup in 1883–84, losing 15–0.\nManchester Rugby Club are the current holders of the unenviable record of the longest ever losing streak in club rugby. \nThe Cheshire based rugby union side finally laid to rest the ‘record breaking’ ghost of eighty seven consecutive league losses spanning just more than three years on 24th March 2012. This was following some poor financial decisions by the rugby management, after being promoted to National League One when the club narrowly avoided bankrupsy.\nManchester Women's Rugby.\nManchester Women's Rugby was founded at Manchester Rugby Club in 1991 in the year of the first ever Women's Rugby World Cup. The club has gone from strength to strength, rising through the leagues to compete in Championship North 2 in the third tier of the RFU English Rugby Union system. The club has established a Women &amp; Girls' Academy section, offering development and competitive rugby to U13, U15, U18 and Senior Women.

        "title": "Shaft (golf)",
        "text": "The shaft of a golf club is the long, tapered tube which connects the golfer's hands to the club head. While hundreds of different designs exist, the primary purpose of the golf shaft remains the same: to provide the player with a way to generate centrifugal force in order to effectively strike the ball. When properly gripped the player can hit the ball further and more accurately, whilst applying less force.\nHistory.\nEarly golf clubs had wooden shafts, most commonly made of hickory. These shafts were resilient and withstood the forces created by the golf swing, but unlike modern, more stiff shafts, their high flexibility required a skilled swing to produce consistent results.\nPrior to 1935, hickory was the dominant material for shaft manufacturing, but it proved difficult to master for most golfers, as well as being quite frail. Steel would become the ubiquitous choice for much of the second half of the twentieth century. Although heavier than hickory, it is much stronger and more consistent in its performance. Prior to steel, a player would need a slightly different swing for each shaft given the inherent inconsistencies in the hickory shafts. The graphite shaft was first marketed in 1970 at the PGA Merchandise Show but did not gain widespread use until the mid-1990s and is now used on almost all woods and some iron sets, as the carbon-fiber composite of graphite shafts boasts increased flex for greater clubhead speed at the cost of slightly reduced accuracy due to greater torque. Steel, which generally has lower torque but less flex than graphite, is still widely preferred by many for irons, wedges and putters as these clubs stress accuracy over distance.\n\"Graphite\" shafts began to emerge in the late twentieth century. The graphite shaft was invented by Frank Thomas in 1969 while working as Chief Design Engineer for Shakespeare Sporting Goods, in collaboration with Union Carbide. The original graphite shafts manufactured by Shakespeare Sporting Goods were filament wound, had extremely consistent properties and were extremely expensive. Subsequent, less expensive flagwrapped versions of the graphite shaft introduced by other manufacturers several years later had inconsistent properties and as a result professionals and skilled amateurs were initially skeptical of the new technology when compared to steel; however, advances in technology, developed by Bruce Williams, an engineer working with an Ohio-based composites company, eventually changed this perception. Graphite shafts are now more common than steel.\nDesign.\nThe shaft is roughly .58 inch/14.7 millimeters in diameter near the grip and between 35 and 48 inches/89–115 cm in length. Shafts weigh between 45 and 150 grams depending on the material and length.\n\"Graphite\" shafts are woven from carbon fiber and are generally lighter in weight than steel shafts. Graphite shafts became popular among amateurs, because lighter weight helped generate increased club-head speed. The carbon fiber also dissipated some of the stinging vibrations that were caused by poorly struck shots.\nModern composite shafts have three layers of fiber winding, adding substantial rigidity, and in turn, performance.\nShafts are quantified in a number of different ways. The most common is the shaft flex. Simply, the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when placed under a load. A stiffer shaft will not flex as much, which requires more power to bend and \"whip\" through the ball properly (which results in higher club speed at impact for more distance), while a more flexible shaft will whip with less power required for better distance on slower swings, but may torque and over-flex if swung with too much power causing the head not to be square, resulting in lower accuracy. Most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes. The most common are: L (Lady), A (Soft Regular, Intermediate or Senior), R (Regular), S (Stiff), and X (Tour Stiff, Extra Stiff or Strong). A regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed (80-94 mph), while an A-Flex (or senior shaft) is for players with a slower swing speed (70-79 mph), and the stiffer shafts, such as S-Flex and X-Flex (Stiff and Extra-Stiff shafts) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed, usually above . Some companies also offer a \"stiff-regular\" or \"firm\" flex for players whose club speed falls in the upper range of a Regular shaft (90-100 mph), allowing golfers and clubmakers to fine-tune the flex for a stronger amateur-level player.\nOn off-center hits, the clubhead twists as a result of a torque, reducing accuracy as the face of the club is not square to the player's stance at impact. In recent years, many manufacturers have produced and marketed many low-torque shafts aimed at reducing the twisting of the clubhead at impact, however these tend to be stiffer along their length as well. Most recently, many brands have introduced stiff-tip shafts. These shafts offer the same flex throughout most of the shaft, in order to attain the \"whip\" required to propel the ball properly, but also include a stiffer tip, which cuts back drastically on the lateral torque acting on the head.\nLastly, shafts are quantified by their \"kick point\", which is the point on the shaft where the flex is the greatest. They are generally defined as \"low-kick\", \"medium-kick\" and \"high-kick\", but the difference between all of these is only a few inches. Low-kick shafts flex the most at a point closer to the clubhead, which causes less of the shaft to flex and produces a higher launch angle. The higher the kickpoint, the lower the launch angle. Because kickpoint also has an effect on how much of the shaft flexes, it can be used to fine-tune the shaft's flex to the player's individual swing tempo.\nWidely overlooked as a part of the club, the shaft is considered by many to be the transmission of the modern clubhead. Current graphite shafts weigh considerably less than their steel counterparts, (sometimes weighing less than 50 grams for a driver shaft) allowing for lighter clubs that can be swung at greater speed. Since 1999 performance shafts have been integrated into the club making process. These shafts are designed to address specific criteria, such as to launch the ball higher or lower or to adjust for the timing of a player's swing to load and unload the shaft at the correct moments of the swing for maximum power. Whereas in the past each club could come with only one shaft, today's clubheads can be fit with dozens of different shafts, creating the potential for a much better fit for the average golfer.\nCharacteristics.\nNew drivers come out all the time with new concepts of how its design is supposed to make you hit the ball further, however that is not the case. It all comes down to the shaft. The shaft is 80 percent of the club and can improve your distance by 20 yard. It is important to get the correct fitting in order for you to see the results you want."

        "title": "Cricket Tasmania Premier League",
        "text": "Cricket Tasmania Premier League, or Tasmanian Premier Cricket, refers to the hierarchically graded cricket competitions played in Tasmania, Australia. The Cricket Tasmania Premier League comes under the administration of Cricket Tasmania.\nGrade Cricket in Australia is the next level below First class cricket, and as such, Male and Female players seeking selection for Tasmania's representative sides, the Tasmanian Tigers, must first prove themselves in the Premier League Competition.\nThe club cricket competition in Tasmania is divided up into three main regional zones, South, North and North-west. Grade sides also compete for a number of competitions in first class cricket, one-day cricket and Twenty20 versions of cricket.\nHistory.\nWith the establishment of the STCA a structured form of competition between clubs started to evolve. However, it was not until the 1869-70 season that a Premier Club was formally recognised, through the consequence of a series of Challenge matches between Derwent, Break o’Day and Wellington, which saw one club merge as the Champion. It would take another twenty years before there was a formal club pennant competition played for premiership points.\nAside from the Challenge series the clubs played social engagements with minor clubs such as Albert, Military, Tradesmen, New Town, Waratah and St Johns to name a few. Trial matches for selection in the Association team to play the Northern Association in the annual intra-colonial fixture, and matches between Hutchins School and the High School, were significant events played on the Battery Ground.\nBut with only one suitable senior playing field available on the Domain and matches often played over three successive Saturdays (with occasional mid-week afternoons allocated to achieve a result) there was great demand from other clubs to use the facility. The playing schedule included specific dates for major matches such as the annual North v South fixture and, with intercolonial matches also slotted into the programme when arrangements were finalised there were rarely more than three meetings between the senior clubs each season.\nBeing able to commit to playing cricket was not easy for many Hobartians; in fact only men of substance were able to do so. On occasions when a club was unable to raise sufficient players from its own ranks players from another club would fill the vacancies. Names from Hutchins and High School dominated the scorecards. It would be many years before labourers and the common folk would have both time and money to become members of the Association and senior clubs.\nA fourth senior club, Lefroy, had a short existence but in 1889 the club, together with its assets and liabilities, was taken over by Break o’Day. Perhaps the most significant part of the acquisition was Charles Eady, then a lad of 19 years; he and Ken Burn (who played with Wellington) would become the two most significant cricketers produced by Tasmania for almost a century.\nBreak o’Day and Wellington, rather than Derwent, shared the spoils of victory until the introduction of District Cricket in 1905-06 when the three old clubs were disbanded and a pennant competition with three grades was implemented between five new clubs – North Hobart, South Hobart, East Hobart, West Hobart and New Town.\nThe Great War was devastating. During this period the Southern Tasmanian Cricket League was formed to administer the game until the Tasmanian Cricket Association resumed control in 1919 when the district competition of pre-war days was abolished with the original clubs, Derwent, Break o’Day and Wellington, continuing on. When the Defence Act was relaxed in 1923 district cricket was re-introduced but with only four clubs – Eastern Suburbs, South Hobart, North-West Hobart and New Town – none with a direct association with the former district clubs established in 1905.\nIn subsequent years other clubs were admitted; some remain while others disbanded or changed names. Eastern Suburbs became Sandy Bay in 1926; Glenorchy and Kingston (later renamed as Kingborough) were admitted in 1931; Clarence (1956) and University (1961) followed and in 1987 South Hobart and Sandy Bay amalgamated. Lindisfarne was admitted in 1992.\nA system of Grade finals has been in place since 1954-55. In 1967 club boundaries were abolished and the district structure was again replaced by club cricket. The limited over one-day and T20 formats were incorporated into the competition in 2003 and 2010 respectively.\nThe Tasmanian Cricket Association Grade competition was renamed the Cricket Tasmania Premier League in 2010. There are now ten clubs playing in five senior Men's grades (1st, 2nd, 3rd, Under 17 and 15’s). In addition, all ten clubs field teams in a Women’s 1st Grade and under-pinning the CTPL Cricket Tasmania's Community Cricket team administers Junior and Youth Leagues for boys and girls from primary and secondary schools.\nChronological History Notes.\nCricket Tasmania Premier League Club Teams.\n Brighton District(Brighton District Eagles)\n Clarence(Clarence Kangaroos)\n Glenorchy(Glenorchy Magpies)\n Greater Northern Tasmania(Greater Northern Raiders)*\n Kingborough(Kingborough Knights)\n Lindisfarne(Lindisfarne Lightning)\n New Town(New Town Bucks)\n North Hobart(North Hobart Demons)\n South Hobart/Sandy Bay(South Hobart/Sandy Bay Sharks)\n University Of Tasmania(University Of Tasmania Lions)\nCricket Tasmania Premier League Representative Teams.\n TCA Chairman's XI(Tasmanian Cricket Association)\n TCA XI(Tasmanian Cricket Association)\n NTCA XI(Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association)\n NWTCA XI(North West Tasmanian Cricket Association)\n Jamie Cox Plate XI(Tasmanian Cricket Association)\n Tasmanian Under 19's XI(Tasmanian Cricket Association)\nCompetitions.\nGrade Cricket.\nGrade cricket is one level below first class cricket competition and consists of games played over at least two days, but sometimes, three, often played over two weekends. In Tasmania there are three senior grades, known simply as \"1st Grade\", \"2nd Grade\", and \"3rd Grade\", and two junior grades, \"Under-17\" and \"Under-15\". Historically, there have been \"4th grade\" and \"5th grade\" competitions.\nKookaburra Cup.\nThe Kookaburra Cup is Tasmania's grade cricket limited overs competition. Games are 50 overs per side, and are played in accordance with current ICC regulations for One Day International.\nJamie Cox Plate.\nThe Jamie Cox Plate is an opportunity for young Tasmanian players of talent to showcase their abilities. It was first held in 2003 and has since become an annual competition held between select XI's of talented players representing the TCA, NTCA, NWTCA and Tasmanian under-19 teams. \nPrevious Winners:\nGrade Twenty/20 Comp.\nThe Twenty/20 comp is a new competition held between Tasmanian club sides according to the rule of the innovative Twenty20 version of cricket. It is designed to equip developing players to play that version of the game at inter-state, and possibly international level later in their careers, as well as giving an exciting new attraction to the grade season.\nGreater Northern Cup.\nIn the current absence of an NTCA competition there is a combined table which incorporates the NTCA clubs and the NWTCA clubs and goes towards deciding an overall \"Greater Northern\" champion.\nThe Premier Club.\nThe Premier Club is the list of clubs who have been champions of the Tasmanian Cricket Association.Up to the end of the 2022/2023 season the complete list of the Premier Club looks like this:"

With the exception of 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule.\nThe Sailing program of 1920 was open for a total of sixteen sailing classes (disciplines), with fourteen Sailing events being contested: the 8.5 metre and 9 metre classes were cancelled as there were no entrants. For each class, three races were scheduled from 7 July 1920 to 10 July 1920, off the coast of Ostend at the North Sea.\nVenue.\nRoyal Yacht Club of Belgium.\nOstend offers a fair condition for sailing on the North Sea. Though there are tidal conditions, the current is reasonable predictable. Local knowledge does not have too much influence of the races. The wind conditions are also good for sailing. However, in the case of the 1920 Summer Olympic regatta's the prevailing breeze did not show. Most races had to be sailed under light air conditions.\nAn unprecedented and unique Olympic situation happened with the races in the 12' Dinghy. When in the second race one of the marks was taken hostage by the tidal current and went drifting the race had to be nullified. Since the organizers did not have the time to resail the race and both teams were of Dutch origin the Belgian organization requested the Dutch Olympic Committee to resail the finals in The Netherlands. As a result, the first Olympic event held in the Netherlands was not in 1928 but already in 1920. As venue of this final the \"Buiten IJ\" in Amsterdam was chosen.\nCompetition.\nOverview.\nA maximum of 2 boats per country per class was allowed.\nCountries.\nSource:\nClasses (equipment).\nSource:\nThe Olympic Sailing event of 1920 was without any doubt the most strangest in history so far. With a program of no less than 16 classes and an entry list that consists of 7 out of 14 classes with just competitor and only one class with more than 3 yachts.\nAfter World War I the International Sailing Authority had obvious no clue in what direction sailing had developed since 1912. The Nordic countries had developed the Skerry Cruiser classes and the International rule classes had adopted in 1919 a new edition of the rule which was not yet implemented in the countries. Therefore, the entries were open for the old, as well the new rule and two Skerry classes. Besides that, an advice from 1908 was followed by putting two \"one design\" classes on the program. By doing this the 1920 Olympics acted as a test laboratory from which the IYRU could draw conclusion for the further development of the sport. These lessons learned, not too many different classes and moving towards one design classes, did show during the next Olympic Sailing event and are still taken into account.\nMedal summary.\nSource:\nOther information.\nSailors.\nDuring the Sailing regattas at the 1920 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:"

The Metre classes (6 and 8) had their races from 21 to 26 July.\nVenue.\nMeulan.\nMeulan was the venue for the Olympic regatta's in the \"French National Monotype\". The host club for the 1924 Olympic Sailing at Meulan was the \"Cercle de la Voile de Paris\".\nLike in 1900 the race conditions at Meulan during the Olympic regatta were not ideal. The light breeze during the first elimination series could hardly make the sailing interesting. When the wind picked up in the second series the conditions must have improved. During the first semi-final the wind came from South East. As a result, the yachts could sail most of the course without tacking or jibing, therefore not challenging the capabilities of the sailors. In the second semi-final however the wind shifted to East-North-East so that tacking was needed in the final legs of the laps.\nLe Havre.\nLe Havre was the venue for the Olympic regattas for the \"6 and 8 Metre\". The host club for the 1924 Olympic Sailing at Le Havre was the \"Société des Régates du Havre\".\nDue to the Easterly winds the courses at Le Havre were mostly reaches.

It also gave issues for those sailors who were competing not only in the Snowbird but also in one of the other classes.\nCourse areas.\nThe courses had been well prepared. The marks were laid by the United States Lighthouse Service in the form of large Government buoys, and kelp beds under the lee of Point Fermin were marked by the United States Navy Department as restricted area. Visiting yachts were kept at a safe distance from the racing boats by the US Coast Guard. Tows were arranged by the US Navy to and from Los Angeles Harbor to the race area's. On the Pacific side of the San Pedro Breakwater the Star, 6 Metre and 8 Metre yachts had their races. Those classes had to pass the Angels Gate light in order to reach the course area. The Snowbird stayed inside the breakwater to protect them from the ocean swell.\nCompetition.\nSource:\nRace schedule.\nSource:\nMedal summary.\nSource:\nMedal table.\nSource:\nNotes.\nStar.\nThe 1932 Olympics featured for the first time the Star as Olympic discipline. This turned out to be so far the longest run for a sailing discipline in the Olympics. The Star was an Olympic class from 1932 to 2012 with the exception of 1976.\nSnowbird.\nThe USOC proposed to discontinue the 12' Dinghy in favor of a small V-bottom Catboat locally known as the Snowbird as the single handed one design class. This proposal was approved by the IYRU and IOC. The locally available Snowbirds were equipped with new masts, sails and rigging.\nMedical assistance.\nFor medical incidents during the Yachting events a United States Navy boat and a US Coast Guard boat were on duty during the races. This boats were equipped with an inhalator and crew furnished by the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nSeven local physicians provided voluntary service (in alphabetical order):\nOther information.\nSailors in multiple disciplines.\nThree sailors attempted to sail in the Snownbird and the Star. This was a challenge since the schedule of the Snowbird was modified due to the light air weather conditions in the mornings of the regattas.\nSailing.\nDuring the Sailing regattas at the 1932 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:"

It was their last points of the season. Quarterback Bobby Layne had been lost for the season two weeks earlier, and backup Tobin Rote led the Lions' rally, scoring 24 unanswered points in the second half to win, 31–27, with Tom Tracy (a Detroit back who hadn't played in four games that played due to injury to John Henry Johnson) scoring two touchdowns. Gene Gedman, another back with little playing time for Detroit, scored the go-ahead touchdown in less than a minute into the fourth quarter. Y.A. Tittle threw three interceptions in the fourth quarter (the last to Roger Zatkoff) and lost a fumble in a disastrous fourth quarter for the 49ers, who had four turnovers in the final frame and saw Joe Perry suffer a broken jaw.

        "text": "Frank Maloney (September 26, 1940 – March 30, 2020) was an American football player and coach. He was the head coach at Syracuse University from 1974 to 1980, succeeding College Football Hall of Fame inductee, Ben Schwartzwalder. Prior to coaching at Syracuse, Maloney was an assistant coach at the University of Michigan under Bump Elliott (1968) and Bo Schembechler (1969–1973). After departing Syracuse he joined the management team for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball.\nCoaching career.\nMaloney's tenure at Syracuse was marked by inconsistency. The fan base turned on him as the Orange failed to achieve the national status they had enjoyed under Schwartzwalder, perhaps, failing to remember that Schwartzwalder's last few seasons were mediocre ones (only one winning season in his last five), and his 1970 team had been stricken by racial unrest. Maloney's program was also limited by archaic facilities. Archbold Stadium, Syracuse's home field since 1907, was in need of replacement. Nonetheless, Maloney did recruit a number of future NFL stars such as Joe Morris and Pro Football Hall of Fame member Art Monk.\nMaloney was the subject of criticism, not only from the fans and alumni, but also from the 1959 national championship team, members of which started a campaign calling for his ousting. Ironically enough, this call from program alumni came during the 1979 season, Maloney's best at Syracuse, when the Orangemen qualified for the Independence Bowl, beating McNeese State. Also, Maloney and the 1979 Orangemen bore the burden of playing an entire season on the road, as Archbold Stadium was demolished following the 1978 season, and the Carrier Dome would not be ready until 1980. The 1979 team played \"home\" games at Rich Stadium in Orchard Park, Schoellkopf Field at Cornell University in Ithaca, and Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nAfter coaching the Orangemen for seven seasons and presiding over the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980, Maloney was fired and replaced by Dick MacPherson.\nChicago Cubs.\nIn 29 seasons in the Chicago Cubs ticket office, including the last 27 as its director, Maloney oversaw nine single-season attendance records, including Wrigley Field's first two-million fan season in 1984 and its first three-million fan season in 2004. Maloney stepped down from his post having helped the Cubs to seven consecutive seasons with three million fans at Wrigley Field starting 2004. Maloney retired at the end of the 2010 calendar year. He remained with the club as a consultant in 2011. He died of brain cancer in Chicago in 2020."

        "text": "The EuroLeague Women (officially known as the \"FIBA EuroLeague Women\") is the pre-eminent basketball league in Europe for women's basketball clubs.\nUnlike the EuroLeague Men, the competition is entirely organized by FIBA Europe.\nHistory.\nEuroLeague Women is the main women's club basketball competition in Europe.\nFirst established by FIBA in September 1958, the inaugural European women's club competition consisted of 10 teams and came about following the success of an equivalent tournament for men's clubs earlier in the same year. The men's tournament consisted of 46 games, with over 100,000 spectators turning out to watch.\nAt the initial tournament Slavia Sofia of Bulgaria were crowned champions, beating Soviet Dynamo Moscow 64–40 at home and then 44–34 on the Muscovites court. The two-game home-and-away format for the final remained until 1976, before changing to a single-game format the following year.\nDuring its formative years, the tournament was dominated by Daugava Riga from Latvia (then Soviet Union) who appeared in 16 finals between 1960 and 1977, winning all 16 of them. The Latvian club maintains two records that are difficult to see being bettered, with 18 overall titles, as well as the record for winning 12 consecutive championships.\nIn the nineties, the competition underwent two key changes. The first was the introduction of the Final Four in 1992; and the second was the rebranding of the competition in 1996, when it went from being known as European Cup for Women's Champion Clubs to what it is known as today: EuroLeague Women.\nThe Final Four format was given its farewell in Ekaterinburg in 2011, when Halcón Avenida defeated Spartak Moscow Region 68–59; before the 2011/2012 season heralded in a new direction for EuroLeague Women with the Final Four replaced by a Final Eight tournament.\nIstanbul were granted the honour of hosting the first Final Eight tournament where Spanish club Ros Casares Valencia prevailed victorious, defeating Rivas Ecópolis 65–52 in the final. In its second year, the EuroLeague Women Final Eight moved to Ekaterinburg, where tournament hosts UMMC Ekaterinburg prevailed 82–56 over Fenerbahçe in the final.\nIn 2014, Ekaterinburg was once again the host of what would ultimately be the final edition of the Final Eight, with the tournament destined to return to a Final Four format for this season. After shocking the home-town favourites UMMC Ekaterinburg in the semi-finals, Galatasaray then went on to become the first Turkish club to lift the title, defeating cross-city rival Fenerbahçe 69–58 in the gold medal game.\nIn February 2022, the Russian teams and officials were expelled from the tournament by FIBA for the playoffs due to the country's invasion of Ukraine. EuroLeague Women suspended Russian clubs UMMC Ekaterinburg, Dynamo Kursk, and MBA Moscow.\nFormat.\n2004–2011.\nThe 24 clubs were divided into four groups of six teams, each with home and away games.\nThe four best-placed clubs in each group qualified for the eighth-final play-offs.\nThe Eighth-finals were established according to the standings (games won, games lost, goal-average) of each team in the preliminary round. This round was played in a home and away game.\nThe winners of the eighth-final round qualified for the quarter-final round.\nThe winners of the quarter-final round qualified for the Final Four, organized by one of the qualified clubs.

        "text": "The 1950 National Football League playoffs took place after the regular season ended with a tie for first place in both the American and National conferences. The ties forced one-game playoffs to determine who would play in the NFL championship game. It was the only time in the NFL's championship game era that two such tiebreaker playoff games were needed in the same year. The Cleveland Browns and New York Giants tied for first place in the American Conference, while the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams tied for first place in the National Conference. The Browns proceeded to beat the Giants 8–3, and the Rams beat the Bears 24–14 in their playoff game. Cleveland then beat the Rams in the championship game the following week. The home teams won all three games in this postseason.\nPlaying their first year in the NFL after four years in the rival All-America Football Conference, the Browns battled with the Giants for the lead in the American Conference for most of the regular season. Cleveland ended with a 10–2 win–loss record, having lost its only two games against the Giants. The Giants, meanwhile, lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Cardinals. In the National Conference, the Bears and Rams were also near the top of the standings in the second half of the 12-game season, and both ended with 9–3 records.\nThe Browns and Giants and the Rams and Bears played their playoff games on December 17. In Cleveland against the Giants, the Browns won a low-scoring game in freezing conditions on two field goals by placekicker Lou Groza and a late-game safety. The Rams beat the Bears in 92-degree heat in Los Angeles, thanks largely to a strong performance by quarterback Bob Waterfield, who threw three touchdowns to end Tom Fears. The results set up a championship matchup between the Browns and Rams. The Browns won the game 30–28 on a Groza field goal with 28 seconds to play.\nBackground.\nWhen the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) folded in late 1949, three of its teams – the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts – were absorbed by the NFL. This forced a realignment of the NFL's divisions into the American and National conferences. The Browns went into the American Conference along with teams mostly from the NFL's old Eastern Division, while the 49ers and Colts went into the National Conference with teams from the old Western Division. Under NFL rules at the time, the teams with the best records in each conference after the 12-game regular season met in the NFL championship to determine the winner of the league.\nThe Browns and the New York Giants jockeyed for first place in the American Conference for most of the regular season. Cleveland ended with a 10–2 win–loss record, both of its losses coming against the Giants. The Giants ended with the same record, having lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Cardinals. In the National Conference, the New York Yanks, Chicago Bears, and Los Angeles Rams were at the top of the standings for most of the season. The Yanks faded with four losses in the final five games, however, leaving the Rams and Bears tied at 9–3 at the end of the season. The Rams lost two of their games against the Bears, while the Bears lost to the Yanks, Cardinals, and Green Bay Packers.\nWith both conferences tied, two playoffs were scheduled to determine which teams would play in the annual championship game. Cleveland won a coin toss to get home-field advantage in its matchup against the Giants on December 17. Chicago played Los Angeles on the same day in Los Angeles. It was the first and only time in the championship game era between 1933 and 1966 when both of the NFL's divisions ended in ties for first place, resulting in two playoff games.\nConference playoff games.\nAmerican Conference.\n \n \nCleveland and New York met in Cleveland on a frozen field as a stiff wind gusted through the stadium. Cleveland drove deep into New York's territory in the first quarter, but a stop by the Giants led to a Lou Groza field goal that put the Browns up 3–0. The game was a defensive struggle through the middle periods. Neither team scored again until the fourth quarter, when Giants quarterback Charlie Conerly led a drive to the Cleveland 36-yard line. From there, Conerly handed the ball to back Gene \"Choo Choo\" Roberts, who sprinted outside the right of the line and appeared headed for a touchdown. Cleveland linebacker Bill Willis chased him down and tackled him at the 4-yard line, however. Bob McChesney then caught a pass from Conerly in the end zone for an apparent touchdown on third down, but it was called back on an offside penalty. Cleveland's Tommy James intercepted Conerly's pass on the next play, but the Browns were called for holding, negating the turnover. The Giants got a new set of downs, but were unable to score a touchdown. A penalty sent them back to the 13-yard line, from where Randy Clay kicked a field goal to tie the score. On the Browns' ensuing drive, coach Paul Brown decided to switch strategies and focus on quarterback keeper plays, calculating that the Giants would be unprepared for runs by Otto Graham. Cleveland advanced to New York's 22-yard line thanks to 45 yards of rushing by Graham, which set up a 28-yard field goal that gave the Browns a 6–3 lead. On the Giants' final possession as time ran out, Martin tackled Conerly in his own end zone, resulting in a safety and making the final score 8–3. The Browns and Giants had only 91 combined passing yards during the game.\nNational Conference.\n \n \n \nThe Bears and Rams faced off at Los Angeles Coliseum in 92-degree heat. The scoring began with a 43-yard field goal by Los Angeles quarterback Bob Waterfield in the first quarter, putting the Rams ahead 3–0. Chicago responded early in the second quarter with a 65-yard drive on eight plays, capped by a 22-yard touchdown run by Al Campana. The Bears' lead was short-lived, however. Waterfield threw two touchdown passes to end Tom Fears later in the second quarter, putting the Rams ahead 17–7 at halftime. The Rams pulled away with a third touchdown pass to Fears in the third quarter. Chicago tried to mount a comeback at the end of the game, but could only manage one touchdown, a 4-yard rush by halfback Fred \"Curly\" Morrison. The Los Angeles defense stopped the Bears on another fourth-quarter drive that reached the Rams' 2-yard line. Following the stop, a fight broke out at midfield between Chicago's George Blanda and the Rams' Dan Towler, leading to a bench-clearing fight that officials and coaches had to break up. The game ended shortly thereafter with the Rams ahead 24–14. Waterfield threw for 280 yards on 14 completions, while Chicago quarterback Johnny Lujack had only 198 yards on 14 completions. While Los Angeles was not known for its defense, it stopped Chicago on two long drives that could have gone for touchdowns. The win was an important one for Joe Stydahar, the Rams' head coach. He was in his first year coaching the Rams, and was going up against Bears coach George Halas, whom he had played under for several years.\nNFL Championship Game.\nLos Angeles had made it to the NFL championship game in 1949, making its appearance against the Browns its second straight. The Rams had one of the most potent offenses in NFL history in 1950. It featured Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin at quarterback, Tom Fears and Bob Boyd at end and Elroy Hirsch at halfback. The Rams averaged 309 passing yards per game, a record that stood until 1984. The team's running unit, led by Dick Hoerner, Vitamin Smith and Dan Towler, averaged more than 140 yards a game. Los Angeles averaged 38.8 points per game in 1950, an NFL record that still stood as of 2007.\nWhile the Rams were unmatched offensively, the Browns' defense gave up half as many points during the regular season. Brown announced before the game that he would employ an umbrella defense against the Rams, similar to the one the Giants had used effectively against the Browns. His plan was to show Los Angeles the umbrella formation at first but switch back to the team's usual formation soon after. He abandoned the umbrella defense after the Rams scored a touchdown on their first play.\n \n \n \n \nThe championship game took place on Christmas Eve in Cleveland a week after the conference playoffs. On the Rams' first play after the opening kickoff, Waterfield passed to Glenn Davis for an 82-yard touchdown, giving Los Angeles an early 7–0 lead. Martin was covering Davis, but slipped on the slick turf, leaving the receiver open. Graham and the Browns' offense responded with a drive later in the first quarter that evened the score, but the Rams went ahead again by a touchdown on a three-yard Hoerner rush. Cleveland scored a second touchdown in the second quarter, this time a 37-yard pass from Graham to Lavelli. Groza's extra point attempt failed, however, because of a high snap, putting the Browns behind by one point. Waterfield missed a 15-yard field goal attempt at the end of the first half, leaving the score at 14–13 at halftime.\nCleveland took the lead again in the third quarter on a 39-yard touchdown pass to Lavelli, his second of the day. The Rams responded with a touchdown run by Hoerner and another touchdown quickly thereafter when Motley fumbled and Los Angeles's Larry Brink took it into the end zone. Down 28–20 as the fourth quarter began, Cleveland was helped by interceptions by Thompson and Lahr that put its offense in good field position. On a drive with 10 minutes left to play, Cleveland went for it on fourth down three times and made the necessary yards each time, advancing to the Los Angeles 14-yard line. From there, Graham threw a touchdown pass to Bumgardner, who dove to catch it in the corner of the end zone. After several more defensive stands, the Browns had the ball back and drove toward the Rams' end zone as the game drew to a close. Graham fumbled, however, and the Rams recovered with three minutes left. Cleveland's defense held, and Los Angeles punted, giving the Browns the ball back at their own 31-yard line with 1:49 left in the game. Graham scrambled up the middle for 16 yards on the first play, and then turned to his receivers. A pass to Bumgardner and two to Jones on the sidelines, followed by another to Bumgardner, put the ball at the Los Angeles 11-yard line. Graham ran a quarterback sneak on the next play to place the ball at the middle of the field in preparation for a field goal. After a time out, Groza came in and kicked the field goal with 0:28 left on the clock to put Cleveland ahead 30–28. The Rams fumbled the ensuing kickoff and the Browns recovered, appearing to seal the victory. The officials ruled that Groza had kicked prematurely, however, and Los Angeles returned his rekick to their 46-yard line. An interception by Lahr on a sideline pass stopped the drive and gave Cleveland the win."

        "text": "The individual show jumping was an equestrian event held as part of the Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. The competition was held on 16 July 1912 as the Stockholm Olympic Stadium. There were 31 competitors from 8 nations. Each nation was limited to a maximum of six riders. The event was won by Jacques Cariou of France, the nation's first victory in the individual jumping. The victory came with a challenge prize presented by Count Gyula Andrássy the Younger of Hungary. Rabod von Kröcher earned Germany's first medal in the event with his silver. Emmanuel de Blommaert of Belgium took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nChile, Germany, Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden each made their debut in the event. Belgium, France, and Russia all competed for the second time, having previously appeared at the first competition in 1900.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1,533 metre course consisted of 19 jumps (15 physical obstacles, 4 of which were jumped twice). Each jump had a maximum of 10 points, so the total possible was 190 points. Long jump obstacles had a maximum distance of 4 metres. The maximum height of jumps was 1.4 metres. \nThe deductions possible were: 2 points for a first refusal, 4 for a second, 6 for a third; 4 points for a horse falling; 6 points for the rider being unseated; 1 point for touching the obstacle without knocking it down; 4 points for knocking an obstacle down with the horse's fore legs, 2 points for knocking it down with the hind legs; 1 point for landing with hind legs on the end line of a long jump, 2 points for the hind legs inside the end line (or touching the surface of the water) or the fore legs on the line, 4 points for the fore legs inside the end line (or touching the water); and 2 points for every 5 seconds over the time limit of 3:50.0 (400 metres per minute).\nOnly \"gentlemen\" were permitted. Thus, professionals, women, and non-commissioned officers were ineligible. Military school horses were excluded, but all other horses were allowed.\nResults.\n3 minutes and 50 seconds were allotted. 190 points was the maximum score.\nThe jump-off for the gold medal used a shortened course of only 6 obstacles. Cariou had 5 faults throughout the jump-off, while von Kröcher had 7."

        "text": "The team jumping was an equestrian event held as part of the Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme. It was the first appearance of the event. Unlike the team eventing competition, the team jumping was not simply a sum of scores from the individual jumping competition. Instead, riders competed in the team event separately a day after the individual event. Different riders could be used in the two events, and teams were limited to 4 riders while each nation could send 6 individuals.\nResults.\n3 minutes and 50 seconds were allotted. 190 points was the maximum score. The top three jumpers for each team counted their scores, which were summed to give a team score."

        "text": "Major League Baseball 2K7 (or MLB 2K7) is a Major League Baseball licensed baseball simulation video game developed by Kush Games and published by 2K. Released on February 27, 2007, it is the only 2007 MLB licensed game available for the Xbox and Xbox 360. It is also available for the PlayStation Portable, the PlayStation 2 and, for the first time, the PlayStation 3, though its competition came in the form of \"\" from 989 Sports. Portable versions for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable were released. It is the first baseball game to be released for the Nintendo DS and the last major release for the original Xbox game console.\nFor the third year in a row, Derek Jeter is the cover athlete, and ESPN baseball broadcasters Jon Miller and Joe Morgan serve as announcers, despite the loss of the ESPN license to Electronic Arts in 2005. Steve Physioc and Jeanne Zelasko cover the pre-game.\nHistory.\nAccording to lead developer Ben Brinkman, \"MLB 2K7\" will be skipped as a Wii title; the first game for the Wii will be \"MLB 2K8\". \"MLB 2K7\" was officially announced as gold on February 23, 2007 and was shipped on February 26; its previous release date had been advertised as March 5. This was presumably to prevent early adoption of \"\" on Sony platforms. However, the GBA and DS versions were conspicuously absent from the announcement.The reported release date for those handhelds is March 19, 2007. It differs vastly from its 2006 release of \"MLB 2K6\".\nA demo was released on Xbox Live Marketplace for Xbox 360 owners on February 26, 2007, allowing them to play Game 7 of the 2006 National League Championship Series starting in the 7th inning.\nThe game and the demo of the game for the 360 and all other game formats were only available in North America and Japan with no plans to release the game in the Europe for PAL systems.\nGameplay.\nThe new iteration features a stunningly lifelike batter/pitcher interface on seventh generation console systems, as well as more detailed models and AI tweaks. Last year's \"Inside Edge\" also returns, with a tweak in that playing to a player's strengths causes a boost in ability.\nOther new features, as published by 2K Sports, include:\nOther additions include a ramped up player and manager ejection system, including a minigame in which the player controlling the manager will tap a button to argue with the umpire; in multiplayer, the opponent will take control of the umpire and try to precision tap a button to eject the opponent's manager. A managerial ejection will cause the player's team to be controlled by the CPU. Umpires also have their own personalities and AI, meaning each umpire will have a unique style of calling a game. An important feature is the use of the joystick's force feedback during same-machine multiplayer - as the invisible icon reaches the edges of the strike zone, the rumble will increase. (PlayStation 3 owners are not able to enjoy this feature due to the lack of such a feature in the gamepad.) Other minor touches include ball boys retrieving baseballs, fans catching foul balls, and dynamic bullpen activity. The PS2 features are tuned fielding, improved baseruning, 2K sports online play, and Inside Edge.\nDownloadable content.\nOn June 28, 2007, the Xbox 360 version received an online update, and announced that a line of classic stadiums would be appearing on Xbox Live Marketplace, starting with Olympic Stadium for free. \"MLB 2K7\" owners have reported in dedicated forums that the update created a save game glitch on their system. This glitch has not been acknowledged nor addressed by the publishers or developers of the game, although players have independently confirmed downloading Olympic Stadium will fix this glitch. Also it adds players who were not in the original roster such as Alex Gordon and Daisuke Matsuzaka, who had signed with the Boston Red Sox, after the game was made.\nOn July 9, 2007, four packages were made available:\nReception.\nThe seventh generation console versions of the game were released to generally positive reviews. The Xbox 360 version was received more positively due to better technical performance. The March 2007 issue of Game Informer awarded the game an 8.5/10 score for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Xbox 360 version of the game received ratings of 7.9/10 from IGN, a B from 1UP and an 8.4/10 from Team Xbox. IGN's score for the PlayStation 3 version was lower (7.5/10).\nOf the sixth generation console versions, IGN awarded both the Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions a 7.0/10. However, IGN strongly criticized the current generation versions for having too many bugs, unimproved player models, incorrect commentary, and most of all, extremely illogical player ratings. GameSpot gave the Xbox version a 6.8 while giving the PS2 version a 6.7 due to the Xbox version supporting progressive scan.\nThe handheld versions received negative reviews due to shallow gameplay. GameSpot stated in its 2.5/10 review of the DS version that it \"lacks basic features every sports game should have.\" The PSP version fared better, averaging a 58% score at GameRankings, but most reviews unfavorably compared it to the PSP version of Sony's \"MLB 07: The Show\". GameSpot awarded the game a 7.3/10, stating \"MLB 2K7 is packed with content and solid gameplay.\"\nSoundtrack.\nThe chiefly alternative rock soundtrack includes the following artists and songs:\n\"(Only 12 of the 21 songs are included on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions.)\""
