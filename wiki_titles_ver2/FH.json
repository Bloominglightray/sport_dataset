        "text": "The equestrian statue of Frederick VII in front of Christiansborg on Slotsholmen in Copenhagen, Denmark, was modelled by Herman Wilhelm Bissen and completed posthumously by his son Vilhelm Bissen in 1873. It was created to commemorate King Frederick's central role in Denmark's transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy.\nDescription.\nThe statue shows Frederik VII of Denmark on horseback, wearing a long coat.\nThe granite plinth is decorated with bronze plaques on all sides. That on the front features a gilt oak wreath and the inscription \"5/IUNI/1849\" in gilt letters. The bronze plate on the left hand side features Frederik VII's motto: \"FOLKETS KIÆRLIGHED/MIN STYRKE\" (The people's love, my strength). The inscription on the right hand side reads \"FREDERIK D: SYVENDE/GRUNDLOVENS GIVER.\" (Frederik the Seventh, granter of the constitution). The inscription on the rear side reads \"FØDT 1808./KONGE 1848./DØD 1863.” (Born 1808, King 1848, died 1863).\nHistory.\n \n \nWhen crown prince Frederick ascended to the Danish throne in 1848, following the death of his father, he became the ninth absolute monarch of Denmark since 1660. On 21 March 1848, a demonstration with 10,000 people gathered on the plaza in front of Christiansborg Palace, demanding a new government and democratic reforms. The king immediately agreed and the Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849.\nThe statue was created on the initiative of a committee chaired by Carl Ploug to commemorate the monarch's role in ensuring Denmark's transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy. It was financed through contributions from the Danish state, the City of Copenhagen and private donations. Herman Wilhelm Bissen was charged with the design of the statue which was later completed by his son Vilhelm Bissen. It was cast by Parisian bronze casters at Vilhelm Bissen's workshop at Carlsberg. The monument was unveiled on 6 October 1873. It survived the fire of the second Christiansborg Palace in 1894."

        "text": "Alex Stewart (born August 24, 1964) is a former Jamaican-born American football defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Minnesota Vikings and Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at Cal State Fullerton.\nEarly years.\nStewart was born in the West Indies (Kingston), Jamaica on August 24, 1964. In December 1977, his family migrated to Canada to avoid the political turmoil of his native country.\nHe eventually moved to the United States. Stewart first played high school football at Malverne High School in Malverne, New York, before transferring to play football at Uniondale High School in Uniondale, New York.\nCollege career.\nHe moved on to Nassau Community College but did not play football. He began his college career at Fresno City College for two seasons and earned J.C. Grid-Wire All-American honors. He later moved on to the University of Southern California. After the firing of head coach Ted Tollner and not playing in any games, he decided to transfer to Cal State Fullerton to play out his final year of eligibility.\nAs a senior, he was played mostly at nose guard. After being slowed by injuries early on the year, he finished with 38 tackles and 9 sacks in eight games. He was named the North's outstanding defensive player (registering 3 sacks) at the 1988 Senior Bowl and also played in the 1989 Blue-Gray Game.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft measurables.\nAt the 1989 NFL scouting combine, he ran a 4.7 40-yard dash, had a 37.5 inches vertical leap, a 10-feet-3 broad jump and recorded 27 consecutive repetitions at 225 pounds in the bench press, which outdid almost every lineman.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nStewart was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the eighth round (219th overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft to play defensive end, which was his natural position. He was in contention for a starting spot on the defensive line, until breaking his wrist a few weeks before the season.\nOn October 12, he was sent to the Dallas Cowboys as part of the Herschel Walker trade.\nDallas Cowboys.\nWhen he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, he was still on the disabled list and spent his time on the practice squad. He was waived on November 9, 1989, after suspicions of steroid use.\nAfter waiving Stewart, the Cowboys threatened to waive the other Vikings players that came in the Herschel Walker trade, in order to get all of the conditional draft picks. Head coach Jimmy Johnson eventually had second thoughts on the February 1 deadline and traded three future draft choices (third-round and tenth-round in 1990 and a third-round in 1991) to the Vikings for the right to retain the original full package of draft choices, plus Issiac Holt, Jesse Solomon and David Howard.\nHouston Oilers.\nOn April 3, 1990, he signed as a free agent with the Houston Oilers. A sprained knee limited his play in training camp and was eventually cut.\nBC Lions.\nStewart was signed by the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in October 1995, but was released before the start of the season.\nPersonal life.\nHis brother Andrew Stewart played defensive end in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals. He also played in the CFL with the Ottawa Rough Riders (1993), BC Lions (1994–1995), Toronto Argonauts (1996–1997), Saskatchewan Roughriders (1998–1999), and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (1999)."

        "text": "The Great Britain men's national rugby sevens team is the men's international rugby 7s team that is the representative team of Great Britain. The team competes in the annual World Rugby Sevens Series as well as the Olympic Games and European Games. Historically, Great Britain was represented in rugby 7s by England, Scotland and Wales but the inclusion of Rugby 7s at the Olympic and European Games, together with funding issues has resulted in the formation of a permanent combined team from 2023. The separate England, Scotland and Wales teams play in the Rugby World Cup Sevens and the Commonwealth Games.\nAfter first having played at the World Games in 2001 and 2005, Great Britain made their debut at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where they won the silver medal, losing the final to Fiji.\nHistory.\nWhen rugby sevens was admitted to the Summer Olympics in 2009, it was not initially known how Great Britain could qualify. As the three nations that make up Great Britain, England, Wales and Scotland, all compete separately in international competition, it was suggested that if any of them gained a qualifying spot then Great Britain would qualify. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), stated that Great Britain must select a lead nation to be the only one able to gain the qualification spot. The individual British rugby unions selected England to be the lead nation as the Rugby Football Union was the only British union to fund a full-time rugby sevens programme. England secured Great Britain's qualification to the 2016 Summer Olympics by finishing fourth in the 2015 Sevens World Series.\nWales rugby sevens winger Lloyd Lewis has said that the decision to combine three nations to form GB sevens teams will limit players' opportunities. He added that a GB team means that there will be more competition for places and less availability for Welsh players.\nEligibility.\nWhile England was the team that qualified Great Britain for the 2016 Olympics, the Great Britain national rugby sevens team is able to select players from Wales and Scotland as well as England similar to the British and Irish Lions in rugby union. Northern Irish players according to the British Olympic Association's rules as British citizens would have been eligible to play for Great Britain; however the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) controversially ruled that Northern Ireland players would be compelled to represent the Ireland national rugby sevens team as rugby in Ireland is organised on an All-Ireland basis. However, it was stated that Northern Irish and Ulster contracted players could legally challenge that determination, particularly if Ireland failed to qualify.\nTournament history.\nSummer Olympic Games.\nA silver medal for Great Britain in the 2016 Olympics is a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players together for the first time on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players have been selected to represent Great Britain during the 2023–24 SVNS tournament beginning in December 2023."

The team played their first competitive match at the 2016 Summer Olympics after England finished in an Olympic qualifying place at the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series.\nThey qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics through England winning the 2019 Rugby Europe Women's Sevens Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Kazan. Great Britain finished in fourth place after losing in the bronze medal match to Fiji. They participated at the 2021 Canada Women's Sevens and won the tournament back to back in Vancouver and Edmonton.\nHistory.\nWhen rugby sevens was admitted to the Summer Olympics in 2009, it was unknown how Great Britain could qualify. England, Wales and Scotland; three of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom that Great Britain represents at the Olympics, all compete separately within international sevens competition. It was suggested that if any of them finished in an Olympic qualifying spot then Great Britain would qualify through them. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Rugby Board (IRB) clarified that Great Britain must select only one nation to be the only one able to obtain qualification as it was viewed that the three individual nations could give Great Britain three chances to qualify compared with other nations only having one. The individual British rugby unions selected England to be the lead nation due to their professional sevens set-up. This also meant that Wales and Scotland could no longer participate in the repecharge competition on behalf of the Sevens Women Grand Prix Series if they qualified due to participation in the repecharge being limited to nations who could qualify for the Olympics. England secured Great Britain's qualification to the 2016 Summer Olympics by finishing fourth in the 2015 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series after defeating the United States in the third place playoff in Amsterdam.\nFollowing qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics, a new Great Britain Sevens organization was set up called GB Rugby Sevens. Despite England being the nation that qualified Great Britain for the Olympics, it was announced that the Welsh Rugby Union and the Scottish Rugby Union would join the Rugby Football Union for Women in forming the executive board and committee to decide the selection of the team. In May 2015, Joe Lydon was appointed as the performance manager responsible for recruiting the head coach for the Great Britain women's rugby sevens team.\nEligibility.\nWhile England was the team that qualified Great Britain for the Olympics, the Great Britain national rugby sevens team is able to select players from Wales and Scotland as well as England in accordance with IOC eligibility rules based on passport ownership. The Rugby Football Union for Women will make recommendations for the team however the British Olympic Association will be the body that makes the final determination for places. Players would be eligible for selection if they had played in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, Rugby Europe International Sevens or any other invitational tournament 14 months before the Olympics.\nNorthern Irish players, according to the IOC's rules as British passport holders, would have been eligible to represent Great Britain. However the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), which governs rugby in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland together, demanded that Northern Irish players only play for the Ireland national rugby sevens team. However, it was stated that Northern Irish players could legally challenge that demand, particularly if Ireland failed to qualify due to differences in World Rugby and IOC qualifying criteria.\nTournament record.\nWorld Rugby Sevens Series.\nThe women's team, along with the men's, competed in the first two (Dubai) of the 2021–22 Sevens Series as a sole team, rather than the individual teams (England, Scotland, Wales). This was in keeping with an agreement to continue playing as one team throughout 2021. Points accumulated by the team were later distributed to the constituent nations fairly, and in proportion."

        "title": "Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union, was a case taken by a member of the Auckland University Rugby Football Club and a member of the Teachers Rugby Football Club against the decision of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) Council to accept an invitation for the All Blacks to tour South Africa. The invitation came just four years after the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand had divided the New Zealand public over the All Blacks refusal to participate in the sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era. The decision primarily concerned whether the two plaintiffs had sufficient standing to challenge the NZRFU decision. The decision marked the adoption of the principles of \"R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex p National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses\" [1982] AC 617 approach to standing in judicial review into New Zealand law. \nBackground.\nOn 20 May 1985 the two plaintiffs, as members of two Auckland rugby union clubs, sought to overturn a decision by the NZRFU Council to accept an invitation for the All Blacks to tour South Africa. As Cooke J noted, They claimed that the decision failed to comply with the object of promoting, fostering and developing amateur rugby union football throughout New Zealand, and that for various specified reasons it gives the game a tarnished and sullied image and will reflect adversely on the game. These contentions we will refer to as the against-the-objects ground. They also claimed that the decision was outside the powers of the Council and could only have been made by the Union in general meeting. This we will refer to as the wrong body ground. They claimed therefore that the decision was invalid and unlawful, and sought a declaration and injunction.\nThe NZRFU as defendants sought to strike out the statement of claim as, \"disclosing no cause of action and as frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process.\" On 6 June the defendants strike out application was heard in the High Court by Sir Ronald Davison, the Chief Justice, who struck out the claim and dismissed the action, declining to grant the plaintiffs standing. The plaintiffs appealed.\nJudgment.\nThe plaintiffs succeeded in their appeal, clearing the way for the claim to proceed to a substantive hearing. Cooke J delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The judgment considered two points of law. \nThe first point concerned whether the NZRFU Council was the wrong body to make the arrangement of matches and tour. The Court agreed with the Chief Justice that the Council was not the wrong body to accept the invitation and held that the appeal failed on this point.\nThe second point concerned whether the plaintiffs had the requisite standing to bring their action against the NZRFU. The Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that implied contracts linked each of them with the NZRFU. However it approved earlier judgments that standing could be granted to those claiming an incorporated association acted beyond its powers even where no contract existed. Here Cooke J said, In cases where an incorporated association is alleged to have acted against its objects but the plaintiff cannot show a contract, we think that all the circumstances have to be considered - case by case or category of case by category of case - in order to determine as a question of mixed law and fact whether or not he or she has sufficient standing.\nThe Court noted that the plaintiffs were connected to the club by a \"chain of contracts\" and that the plaintiffs were \"at grass roots level; but it is the players, who are all at that level, for whom basically the organisation exists\". The Court also noted that in exercising its discretion to grant standing regard had to be had to the plaintiff's claims that the NZRFU was acting contrary to the fundamental goals of its constitution and that \"the decision challenged is probably at least as important as - if not more important than - any other in the history of the game in New Zealand.\" As Cooke J noted, The decision affects the New Zealand community as a whole and so relations between the community and those, like the plaintiffs, specifically and legally associated with the sport. Indeed judicial notice can be taken of the obvious fact that in the view of a significant number of people, but no doubt contrary to the view of another significant number, the decision affects the international relations or standing of New Zealand.\nThe Court also noted that although the NZRFU was a private, voluntary association, its decision in this case put it in a \"position of major national importance\"; that the plaintiffs could not be dismissed as \"mere busybodies, cranks or other mischief makers\"; that unless persons such as the plaintiffs were granted standing they would have no \"effective way of establishing whether or not the Union is acting within its lawful powers\"; and that,\nAs a result of the disturbances accompanying the 1981 South African tour of New Zealand many citizens, including normally law-abiding citizens, were alleged to have gone too far when indulging in protest activity. The importance of preserving law and order was rightly stressed. The Courts applied the law impartially. There were numerous prosecutions, many of them successful. It is now no less appropriate that the lawfulness of the Union's decision under its own constitution to arrange the proposed tour should be open to test in the Courts.\nSignificance.\nWith standing granted, the hearing of the substantive action began in the Wellington High Court on 8 July, with the All Blacks due to leave for South Africa on 17 July. On 11 July the plaintiffs applied for an interim injunction to prevent the team leaving as it became clear the hearing would not be finished before the All Blacks were due to depart. Casey J ruled that, \n[T]he plaintiffs in my opinion have put forward a strong prima facie case at this point for their proposition that the present tour cannot benefit rugby in this country. The correspondence and other evidence demonstrates much the same split in the community [as in 1981] over the issue, and those opposed cannot be brushed aside as irresponsible trouble makers or publicity seekers, as some of the evidence and opinions from the Union suggests. It is impossible to regard the leaders of nearly all our major churches, or a unanimous House of Representatives or the Auckland and North Harbour Rugby Unions in this light. Nor is the case answered by counting the heads of those who support the tour and suggesting they may be in a majority.\nWith the injunction granted the All Blacks tour of South Africa was halted. However an unofficial New Zealand team dubbed the New Zealand Cavaliers did tour South Africa in 1986."

On February 8, Nessman confirmed that Kinney's suspension would continue until the end of the season; the \"San Jose Mercury News\" reported that the suspension \"is believed to be related to academics.\" After Kinney's second suspension, when the team was 9–6, San Jose State's scoring average went down 15 points to 49.8, and the team never won another game on the way to a 9–20 final record. Nessman was fired immediately after the season.\nProfessional career.\nOn August 6, 2013, Kinney signed with Özel Gelişim Koleji of the Turkish Basketball Second League.

In 22 games, he averaged 5.9 points, 2.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.1 steals per game as the Suns finished their first season with a dismal 4–22 win/loss record and a last place finish.\nCameron played in a career-low 18 games (not including his development player season) for the Suns in 1994 and subsequently averaged 4.3 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.0 steals per game. In 1995, the Suns showed improvement with a 9–17 win/loss record on the season. Cameron's production increased as he averaged 7.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.2 steals in 26 games. He was also selected to the Future Forces game held during the NBL All-Star Weekend in Adelaide. In the following season, Cameron's points numbers dropped to 5.8 per game despite starting in most of the Suns' games.\nCameron's best season in the NBL came in 1997 with career-highs of 12.3 points and 1.6 steals, in addition to 4.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. On 8 August 1997, Cameron hit the 20-point mark for the first time in his career in a win over the Adelaide 36ers. Cameron's best NBL season corresponded with the Suns also having their best season in 1997 as they finished with a 14–16 win/loss record a seventh-place finish, one win off a playoff spot that Brisbane nabbed with 15 wins.\nWhile his points averages did drop in 1998, Cameron still managed to average a career-high 4.7 rebounds and score a career-high 22 points on 27 March in a win over the Canberra Cannons. 1998 marked the end of the Suns brand as the club changed their name to the Crocodiles for the 1998–99 NBL season. With 151 games played out of the Suns' 164, Cameron was the only player to have played in all six Suns seasons.\nFinal years in NBL (1998–2000).\nCameron was one of six Suns players to stick with the club for the Crocodiles' inaugural season in 1998–99. But with the name change came a career-low season for Cameron as he averaged just 2.4 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 26 games.\nAfter parting ways with Townsville following a disappointing 1998–99 season, Cameron moved back to Brisbane and re-joined the Bullets for the 1999–2000 NBL season. In what was Cameron's final season in the NBL, he averaged 5.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 28 games.\nPost-NBL career.\nSouth West Metro Pirates (2003).\nBetween 1999 and 2003, Cameron played in the Queensland Basketball League (QBL) for the Mackay Meteors and the South West Metro Pirates. Playing for the Pirates in 2003, Cameron guided them to a maiden QBL championship and a trip to the ABA National Finals. There, the Pirates faced off against the Canberra Gunners on 29 August for a spot in the semi-finals. Unfortunately, with a 102–83 loss, they were knocked out of the championship race, and the following day, they faced fellow eliminated quarter-finalist Forestville Eagles, also losing this encounter 118–102. Despite their two losses, Cameron was named to the ABA Finals All-Star Five alongside NBL players Daniel Egan and Chris Stauber.\nBendigo Braves (2004–2007).\nIn 2004, Cameron moved south to join the Bendigo Braves of the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL). In just his second season with the Braves, he returned to the ABA National Finals playing alongside future Perth Wildcats legend Shawn Redhage. The Braves won all but five regular season games in 2005 and were successful in claiming the SEABL South championship with a 105–99 grand final win over the Kilsyth Cobras. The Braves went on to cap off a spectacular season with a 102–98 ABA Grand Final win over the Sydney City Comets, as Cameron earned Grand Final MVP honours. Two seasons later, the Braves repeated as SEABL South champions and booked themselves a place in the 2007 Australian Club Championships (ACC) with another South Grand Final defeat of the Kilsyth Cobras. In the 74–63 win, Cameron earned Grand Final MVP honours. Despite having the confidence of their 2005 win behind them, the Braves were convincingly beaten 100–70 by Big V champions the Dandenong Rangers in their quarter-final match-up. In what was Cameron's final game for the Braves, he scored 12 points in the disappointing loss. In 98 games for the Braves over four seasons (being co-captain for the last three alongside Ben Harvey), Cameron averaged 14.9 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.\nReturn to South West Metro (2008–2010).\nIn 2008, Cameron returned to Queensland where he re-joined the South West Metro Pirates as a player/coach. He made an immediate impact over the first three games, averaging 18 points and 8 rebounds while earning Player of the Week honours for Round 3. The Pirates held top position on the ladder for a long stretch of the 2008 season, and with an 8–0 record by mid-June, Cameron earned the Coach of the Month honours for the season's second month. They were competition front-runners from Rounds 7 through 11 and showed they were up to any challenge thrown at them. On 30 June, the Pirates played the UNLV Runnin' Rebels college basketball team in their fifth of six exhibition games on their tour of Australia. Hosting the Rebels at the Queensland Academy of Sport's Athletics Centre, the Pirates were easily defeated 97–55 despite a notable 14-point effort from Cameron. Cameron and teammate Brendan Teys were superb throughout the QBL season and helped the Pirates win their quarter-final match-up against the Logan Thunder. The Pirates unfortunately lost to the Townsville Heat in the semi-final despite having won the earlier season match-up with the Heat in Round 2. Cameron was subsequently named the QBL Coach of the Year.\nReturning to the Pirates in 2009 as captain/coach, Cameron guided the club to a third straight semi-final, but again could not get them over the hump as they were beaten by the eventual champions Cairns Marlins in a 37-point thrashing. In what was his final game as coach of the Pirates, Cameron recorded 13 points and 10 rebounds in the 115–78 loss. In January 2010, Cameron was replaced as coach of the Pirates by former NBL player and Australian Boomer Stephen Black. Cameron did return as just a player for the Pirates in 2010, alongside fellow returnees Nate Niesler and Troy Thomson, and continued to captain the team. However, he managed just 13 games for the Pirates in 2010 due to injury and subsequently retired from basketball at the end of the season."

        "text": "The men's tournament in ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics was held in Gangneung, South Korea between 14 and 25 February 2018. Twelve countries qualified for the tournament; eight of them did so automatically by virtue of their ranking by the International Ice Hockey Federation, one, South Korea, automatically qualified as hosts, while the three others took part in a qualification tournament.\nAfter five consecutive Olympic tournaments in which the National Hockey League (the world's premier professional league) allowed its players to participate in the Olympics and adjusted its schedule to accommodate the tournament, the NHL announced in 2017 that it would prohibit any player under NHL contract, including those not actually playing for an NHL team, from participating in the Olympics. The NHL secured the cooperation of the International Ice Hockey Federation and the IOC ensuring that nations would not be allowed to ask NHL players to participate.\nUnlike the NHL, the vast majority of European leagues accommodated an Olympic break, headlined by Russia-based KHL's 33-day break, Sweden-based Swedish Hockey League's 14-day break, Switzerland-based National League's 25-day break, German-based Eishockey Liga's 26-day break, Czech Republic-based Extraliga's 18-day break, and Slovakia-based Tipsport liga's 14-day break. Conversely, Finland-based SM-liiga did not accommodate a break, but allowed its top players to leave the clubs and participate in the Olympic Games.\nThe Russian national team, competing under the name of the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR), won the gold medal, defeating the German national team with a score of 4–3 in overtime in the final. For Germany, winning the silver medal was the greatest achievement in the history of German ice hockey and the first medal win since the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, when West Germany won the bronze medal.\nDefending champion Canada secured third place and bronze, defeating Czech Republic 6–4 in the bronze medal game.\nQualification.\nCanada, Russia, Sweden, Finland, United States, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Slovakia qualified as the top eight teams in the IIHF World Ranking in 2015.\nSouth Korea qualified as host team. To field a competitive team, the South Korean government agreed to grant one American and six Canadian hockey players that were playing in Korean leagues dual citizenship to make them eligible for the national team. The remaining three teams qualified from qualification tournaments.\nMatch officials.\n14 referees and 14 linesmen were selected for the tournament.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+9).\"\nTiebreak criteria.\nIn each group, teams will be ranked according to the following criteria:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking after preliminary round.\nFollowing the completion of the preliminary round, all teams will be ranked 1D through 12D.

        "title": "Basketball in Germany",
        "text": "Basketball is one of the most popular sports in Germany, and is played on both the amateur and professional levels. Basketball has a long history in Germany, with its popularity having developed slowly. \nBeginning.\nBasketball was first introduced to Germany in 1896, by August Hermann, a physical education pioneer. Hermann's son Ernst had emigrated to Boston and introduced the game of basketball to his father. Originally, Hermann was searching for a sport for girls to play as an alternative to soccer. August held the first game in Germany in the city of Braunschweig where he was a well-known advocate and instructor of physical education and sports. Thereafter, he invented a number of sports and wrote rule books. He wrote the rule book for \"Korbball\" (basketball) that same year. He adopted the name Korbball because at the time, American expressions and names were frowned upon. Hermann was a board member of the \"Central Committee on Public and Youth Games in Germany\" and in this capacity, he attempted to publicize the game of basketball for girls. Despite these efforts, basketball didn't take hold until several decades later. In 1921, basketball was included in the guidelines for physical education for girls, but only a few schools participated. Because of the lack of participation and lack of sport association affiliation, basketball had no significant following. Basketball developed very slowly. Germany was one of the last countries in Europe to adopt basketball as a major sport.\nIncrease in popularity.\nIn 1933, Hermann Niebuhr—who had become involved with basketball at an American college in Istanbul—returned to Germany and re-introduced basketball to several universities and sports clubs. Niebuhr is considered the \"Father of German Basketball.\" As a result of implementing basketball at universities in Munich, Breslau, Gera, Wünsdorf and Bad Kreuznach, foreign students began to play. Foreign students and German physical instructors were either from the United States or had traveled to the United States and saw basketball games there. These were the first to request increasing basketball's presence. In 1935, basketball became an organized sport. In April 1935 there were four organized basketball teams in Germany and that increased to 153 by 1937. The first national basketball championships were organized in 1939.\nBerlin Olympics.\nIn 1936, the International Olympic Committee included basketball as an official medal event. The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin. Though the basketball games were played outdoors in poor conditions, there was significant media coverage of the sport in Germany. Germany placed 17th out of 21 teams.\nMembers of the German Olympic Team.\nDespite increased interest in the sport during the late 1930s, World War II stopped all development of basketball in Germany.\nNew beginning following World War II.\nFollowing World War II, the United States government sent the Harlem Globetrotters to Germany in 1951 to help counter communism. The game drew 75,000 spectators which set a world record for the largest crowd to watch a basketball game. Although The International Basketball Federation (French: Fédération Internationale de Basketball or FIBA) was created in 1932, Germany was not one of the first eight European teams. Germany's first appears in the European Championships was in 1951 in Paris. They placed 15th out of 18 teams. In 1956, the International Basketball Federation (French: Fédération Internationale de Basketball or FIBA) was relocated to Munich from Geneva.\nDeutscher Basketball Bund.\nThe German Basketball Federation, or Deutscher Basketball Bund, was founded in 1949.\nThe Bundesliga.\nThe German Basketball League (the Basketball-Bundesliga, or BBL) was created in 1964. On 1 October 1966, the first season began. This is the highest level tier of professional club basketball competition in Germany. It currently has 18 teams, competing for the national champion title.\nConnection with basketball in America.\nThere is a strong American connection and many of the German teams recruit players from American universities. There are also many Germans who are recruited to play at the college level and in the National Basketball Association, or NBA."

        "text": "Super Bowl LIII was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2018 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams, 13–3. The game was played on February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta and was the first Super Bowl played at the stadium.\nThe Patriots' victory was their sixth, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl championships. New England, after finishing the regular season with an 11–5 record, advanced to their 11th Super Bowl appearance, their third in a row, and their ninth under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Rams finished the regular season with a 13–3 record under head coach Sean McVay, the youngest head coach in the Super Bowl at 33, as they advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance and their first since relocating back from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016. Super Bowl LIII was a rematch of 2001's Super Bowl XXXVI, the first championship won by Belichick and Brady and the beginning of the Patriots dynasty. It was the 13th meeting in a major sports championship between the Greater Los Angeles and Greater Boston areas and the first championship between the two regions in the NFL. The game also marked the first Super Bowl appearance of a Los Angeles-based team since the Los Angeles Raiders appeared in 1983's Super Bowl XVIII and the Rams' first as a Los Angeles team since 1979's Super Bowl XIV. This would also mark the Rams' last Super Bowl appearance until Super Bowl LVI in which they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals.\nSuper Bowl LIII was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in NFL history, as both teams' defenses took over the first three quarters. The game marked the first Super Bowl in which neither team had a touchdown through the first three quarters, as the Patriots and the Rams fought to a 3–3 tie entering the fourth. In the final quarter, New England scored 10 unanswered points to claim victory, including the game's only touchdown by running back Sony Michel. The Patriots' one touchdown tied them with the New York Jets in Super Bowl III for the fewest by a winning Super Bowl team, while the Rams became the second Super Bowl team to not score a touchdown after the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI. Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who caught 10 passes for 141 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Brady and Belichick became the oldest starting quarterback and head coach to win the Super Bowl at 41 and 66, respectively, and Brady was also the first starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl in his 40s. It marked the final Super Bowl of the Patriots dynasty, as Brady departed New England after the 2019 season.\nThe broadcast of the game on CBS, along with the halftime show headlined by U.S. pop group Maroon 5, saw the smallest Super Bowl audience in 10 years. Due to its low-scoring nature and both teams' offensive struggles, the game has been regarded as one of the worst Super Bowls, although the defensive performances of both teams are considered among the greatest.\nBackground.\nHost-selection process.\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host Super Bowl LIII in 2019, LIV in 2020 and LV in 2021. NFL owners voted on these cities on May 24, 2016, with the first round of voting determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding a different site for Super Bowl LIV and the third round deciding the site for Super Bowl LV. The four finalists for Super Bowl LIII, all in the Southeastern United States, were:\nAfter three votes, Atlanta was awarded Super Bowl LIII at the NFL owners' meeting on May 24, 2016. The losing candidates, except for New Orleans which removed itself from the voting for all games except Super Bowl LIII due to event conflicts in 2020 and 2021, were then pitted against SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California for Super Bowl LIV and Super Bowl LV hosting rights. Miami eventually won the rights to host Super Bowl LIV and Los Angeles won the rights to host Super Bowl LV. However, on May 23, 2017, NFL owners opted to award Super Bowl LV to Tampa and give Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles after it was announced that SoFi Stadium would open in 2020 due to construction delays. New Orleans would be awarded Super Bowl LVIII.\nThe NFL unveiled the official logo for Super Bowl LIII in February 2018; it is a navy blue-tinted version of the design that was introduced at Super Bowl LI, and the overall branding of the game featured use of blue and red. The host committee logo featured a stylized overhead rendition of Mercedes-Benz Stadium's roof.\nTeams.\nNew England Patriots.\nThe Patriots finished the 2018 season with an 11–5 record to earn the #2 seed in the AFC and their 17th season with at least ten wins in their 19 years under 66-year-old head coach Bill Belichick. They went on to join the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills as the only teams in NFL history to ever reach three consecutive Super Bowls. Though the team had only two Pro Bowl selections, they scored 436 points (fourth in the league) while giving up only 325 (seventh fewest).\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady earned his 14th Pro Bowl selection at age 41, finishing the season with 4,355 passing yards and 29 touchdowns, with only 11 interceptions, while also rushing for 35 yards and two more scores on the ground. These totals made him just the second quarterback in NFL history to amass 70,000 career passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards. His top receiver from the previous season, Brandin Cooks, was traded to the eventual Super Bowl rival Rams, but Julian Edelman, who not only had missed the previous season with an torn ACL injury but was suspended for the first four games of the regular season after testing positive for PEDs, returned to catch 74 receptions for a team-leading 850 yards and six touchdowns, while also returning 20 punts for 154 yards. Other key receivers included Chris Hogan (35 receptions for 553 yards and three touchdowns) and Josh Gordon (40 receptions for 720 yards and three touchdowns), though Gordon would end up leaving the team to focus on his mental health after 11 games when faced with a suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Tight end Rob Gronkowski added 47 receptions for 682 yards and three touchdowns. Meanwhile, the running game featured a dynamic new weapon, rookie halfback Sony Michel, who lead the team with 931 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns, along with veteran James White who racked up 1,176 yards from scrimmage while leading the team in receptions (87) and total touchdowns (12). On special teams, receiver Cordarrelle Patterson returned 23 kickoffs for 663 yards and a touchdown, an average of 28.8 yards per return (third in the NFL), while also catching 21 passes for 247 yards, rushing for 228 yards and scoring four touchdowns on offense.\nOn defense, defensive end Trey Flowers led the team with 7.5 sacks and also forced three fumbles. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy led the team in total tackles (92), while also recording 3.5 sacks, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries. In the secondary, safety Duron Harmon led the team in interceptions for the second year in a row with four, while Pro Bowl cornerback Stephon Gilmore intercepted two passes and forced two fumbles. Safety Patrick Chung also made an impact with 84 total tackles to go with an interception and a fumble recovery. The Patriots secondary also featured twin brothers Jason McCourty and Devin McCourty, who both had an interception each. Devin had 82 tackles, while Jason had 70.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nThe Rams finished the 2018 season earning the #2 seed in the NFC, before knocking off the fourth seeded Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round and top seeded New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship to earn their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history. The Rams went from 2004 to 2016 without recording a winning record. After relocating from St. Louis back to Los Angeles and posting a dismal 4–12 season in 2016, the team's fortunes changed with the hiring of 30-year-old head coach Sean McVay, the youngest head coach in NFL history. Under McVay and second year quarterback Jared Goff, who recovered from a lackluster winless rookie season to record a triple digit passer rating, the Rams improved to an 11–5 record in 2017. Then in 2018, they won their first eight games and finished the year with a 13–3 record, tying the Saints for the best record in the NFC. New Orleans won the top seed since they had defeated the Rams in the regular season.\nThe Rams offense ranked second in the NFL in both points scored (527) and yards gained (6,738). Goff continued to improve in his third season, setting new career highs in passing yards (4,688, fourth in the NFL), passing touchdowns (32), passer rating (101.1), rushing yards (108) and rushing touchdowns (two). His top receiver was Robert Woods, who caught 86 passes for 1,219 yards and 6 touchdowns. Brandin Cooks, an off-season pickup from the Patriots via trade, also made a big impact with 80 receptions for 1,204 yards and 5 scores. The team's #3 receiver, Cooper Kupp, suffered a season ending injury after catching 40 passes for 566 yards in 8 games, forcing Goff to rely heavily on other targets like Gerald Everett (32 receptions) and Josh Reynolds (29). Pro Bowl running back Todd Gurley was the team's leading rusher with 1,251 yards (fourth in the NFL) and 17 touchdowns, while also catching 59 passes for 580 yards and five more touchdowns. His 17 rushing touchdowns led the league, while his 22 total touchdowns gave him 132 points, fifth in the NFL. Running back C. J. Anderson, who made the Rams his third different team in 2018 after signing up with them in December, also was a key aspect of the running game, finishing the season with 405 yards and leading the team in rushing in both of their playoff victories. On special teams, JoJo Natson returned 26 punts for 280 yards, while kicker Greg Zuerlein made 87.1% of his field goals, including a franchise postseason record 57-yard kick to defeat the Saints in overtime in the NFC championship game.\nThe Rams defense featured Pro Bowl defensive tackle Aaron Donald, who led the league in sacks with 20.5, as many sacks as the rest of the team combined. He also had 59 tackles (25 for loss), four forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. Veteran defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh was second on the team with 4.5 sacks, while also getting 59 tackles and recovering two fumbles. Pro Bowl linebacker Cory Littleton led the team in total tackles with 125, while also picking up four sacks, three interceptions and blocking two punts. The Rams also had a strong secondary, led by John Johnson (119 tackles and four interceptions), Marcus Peters (three interceptions), Lamarcus Joyner (78 tackles) and Aqib Talib.\nPlayoffs.\nIn the playoffs, the Patriots earned a first-round bye as the AFC's second overall seed. In the divisional round, they defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 41–28, scoring touchdowns on five of their first six possessions. Brady passed for 343 yards and a touchdown, while running back Sony Michel rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns. They then defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 37–31 in the AFC Championship Game, scoring the game-winning touchdown in overtime. The Patriots held a 14–0 lead at halftime, before the Chiefs rallied to take the lead 21–17 in the fourth quarter. From there, both teams took turns taking the lead, until the Chiefs forced overtime with a 39-yard field goal by Harrison Butker to tie the game 31–31. The Patriots won the coin toss to start their offense for overtime, where Rex Burkhead scored a two-yard touchdown to win the game. Michel ended up rushing for a combined total of 242 yards and five touchdowns in the Patriots' two playoff games, setting an NFL record for postseason rushing touchdowns by a rookie. The Patriots defense held Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce, who had both gained over 1,300 receiving yards during the season, to a combined total of just four receptions for 65 yards.\nMeanwhile, the Rams also had a first-round bye as the NFC's second overall seed. They started off the divisional round by defeating the Dallas Cowboys 30–22. The Rams gained 273 yards on the ground with running backs Todd Gurley and C. J. Anderson rushing for over 100 yards each. They then defeated the New Orleans Saints 26–23 in the NFC Championship Game, scoring a game-winning field goal in overtime. The Saints jumped out to an early 13–0 first quarter lead, before the Rams rallied to close the lead to 13–10 at halftime. In the fourth quarter, Greg Zuerlein tied the game at 20–20, with just over 5 minutes remaining. The Saints moved the ball to the Rams' 13 yard line, but could not gain a first down. On third down, quarterback Drew Brees threw a pass to receiver Tommylee Lewis, who was covered by Nickell Robey-Coleman. Though Robey-Coleman knocked Lewis to the ground early and the pass fell incomplete, the obvious penalty was not called and the Saints' Wil Lutz kicked a 31-yard field goal to take the lead. The Rams took possession and sent the game to overtime with a 48-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein. Although the Rams lost the coin toss and had to start their defense for overtime, Brees threw an interception on the Saints' first drive and Zuerlein kicked a 57-yard field goal to win the game.\nPre-game notes.\nThe game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI between the Patriots and the Rams; the Rams at the time were based in St. Louis. However, only one player, Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady, remained on either roster from that contest. Bill Belichick, the Patriots' head coach in the previous contest, also remained in that position for this game. Super Bowl LIII featured record setting age differences between each team's starting quarterbacks and head coaches, pitting 41-year-old Brady against 24-year-old Jared Goff, as well as 66-year-old Belichick against 33-year-old Sean McVay.\nThe then-St. Louis Rams won their sole Super Bowl title in Atlanta, Super Bowl XXXIV, hosted at the now-demolished Georgia Dome in 2000, which was located adjacent to Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Rams elected to wear their royal blue and yellow throwback uniforms for the game, which they have previously worn for six home games including a home playoff game during the 2018 season. The Patriots wore their standard white away uniforms.\nGambling establishments had the Patriots as 2 ½ point favorites and projected 56 total points would be scored.\nBoston and Los Angeles teams of other professional sports have met in the championship rounds, popularizing the \"Beat L.A.\" chant and the hashtag \"#BeatLA\". The Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers have contested a record eleven NBA Finals since the Lakers moved from Minneapolis in 1960. Furthermore, Los Angeles Galaxy and New England Revolution have contested three MLS Cups. The Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers faced off in the 2018 World Series, and with the Patriots and Rams meeting in Super Bowl LIII, it was only the second time in 50 years that two cities' MLB and NFL teams have competed for the league title in the same season (or calendar year), the first time being in 1969 when the New York Jets and Baltimore Colts competed for Super Bowl III in January 1969 followed by the 1969 World Series featuring the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles. The Patriots faced another Los Angeles-based team in the same playoffs, the Chargers in the divisional round, en route to their Super Bowl meeting with the Rams.\nAssociated events.\nPre-game events and entertainment were centered around downtown Atlanta, with State Farm Arena having hosted Super Bowl Opening Night, the Georgia World Congress Center hosting the Super Bowl Experience and Super Bowl Live at Centennial Olympic Park. State Farm Arena also hosted the inaugural \"Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest\", a three-night concert series that was headlined by Ludacris and Migos (night 1), Aerosmith and Post Malone (night 2), and Bruno Mars and Cardi B (night 3). The show competed with a \"Super Saturday Night\" concert held by DirecTV at a temporary venue near Atlantic Station, headlined by the Foo Fighters and featuring Roger Taylor, Zac Brown, Tom Morello, Perry Farrell and Dave Koz as special guests.\nThe NFL officially launched its centennial commemorations at Super Bowl LIII, ahead of its 100th season. A themed, two-minute advertisement was aired during the game.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LIII was broadcast by CBS as part of an annual rotation between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. It was the 20th time CBS broadcast the game.\nJim Nantz served as play-by-play announcer and Tony Romo worked his first Super Bowl as color commentator. CBS' coverage utilized a total of 115 cameras, including 8K resolution cameras (for the first time in a U.S. network sports telecast) in the end zones, as well as field-level and \"up close\" augmented reality graphics (with the latter generated by a wireless, handheld camera).\nAs with CBS's previous Super Bowl (Super Bowl 50), ESPN Deportes aired a Spanish-language broadcast of the game, the second out of three Super Bowls the network would eventually sub-license.\nAdvertising.\nWith a base price slightly higher than $5 million for a 30-second ad, the cost of commercial time remained even with the previous three events. There were fewer spots sold overall in comparison to the previous Super Bowl; CBS aired more than double the number of promos for its own programming (as well as that of its subscription service CBS All Access) than NBC did at Super Bowl LII. Despite this, Kantar estimated its total revenue to be the third-highest in Super Bowl history, at $382 million.\nPerennial Super Bowl advertiser Anheuser-Busch made its largest-ever advertising purchase for a single game, with a total of eight different commercials of various lengths (covering five-and-a-half minutes of airtime) across seven product brands, including three being advertised during the game for the first time. Mercedes-Benz aired a minute long ad for the 2019 A-Class Sedan featuring cameos by Ludacris. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures aired a half-minute long Teaser for highly anticipated . CBS rejected an ad from medical cannabis company Acreage Holdings advocating for legalization.\nFor the first time in its history, the NFL itself won \"USA Today\"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey determining the best commercial aired during the game, with an advertisement launching a campaign celebrating its 100th season.\nLead-out programs.\nCBS's lead-out program was the series premiere of the talent competition series \"The World's Best\". After late local programs, CBS also aired a special Sunday-night episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\".\nRatings.\nInitial overnight Nielsen Ratings measured a 44.9 rating for the game, down 5% from the previous year and the lowest rating for a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XLIII ten years prior. 98.2 million viewers were measured, the fewest since Super Bowl XLII. Jemele Hill of \"The Atlantic\" attributed the low ratings \"to the game being the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, moderate national interest in the Rams, the lingering bad taste from the huge blown call in the NFC Championship Game, and Patriots fatigue\". In New Orleans, whose Saints had lost the NFC Championship in part because of the blown call, ratings were down 51% compared to Super Bowl LII as Louisianans boycotted and refused to watch the game. Outside the Boston market, where the 57.1 overnight rating was the highest among local markets, the highest-rated markets were in Richmond, Virginia and Buffalo, New York (the latter having traditionally high ratings for sporting events and being the home of the Patriots' division rivals the Buffalo Bills); Los Angeles was near the national average. A downturn of approximately 5% was noted during the halftime show. The fewer television viewers did not migrate to online or mobile platforms; viewership online and on mobile only totaled 2.5 million viewers, which was not an appreciable enough change to affect the overall viewership decline.\nStreaming.\nDigitally, this was the first Super Bowl available through CBS's subscription service CBS All Access. The game was also available via the CBS Sports app, CBSSports.com, the Yahoo! Sports app, Tumblr app, the NFL app. The Yahoo! Sports app and Tumblr app streams were part of a long-term deal between then NFL and Verizon Media.\nRadio.\nThe game was broadcast on radio nationally on Westwood One. SiriusXM carried the game in eight languages and hometown broadcasts from Boston's WBZ-FM and Los Angeles's KSPN and KCBS-FM, along with the main feed on Sirius XM NFL Radio.\nInternational.\nIn Canada, the game was aired by CTV, CTV 2 and TSN. Unifor purchased time on the Canadian broadcast to air an attack ad criticizing General Motors' decision to close the Oshawa Car Assembly plant, defying demands from the company to pull the ad because they deemed it to be misleading.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, ESPN Australia aired an ESPN-produced broadcast of the game that featured the \"Monday Night Football\" commentary crew of Joe Tessitore, Jason Witten and Booger McFarland (McFarland was in the booth rather than the Booger Mobile, the controversial sideline vehicle he used that was abandoned before the end of the 2018 \"MNF\" season). It would prove to be Witten's last commentary appearance for the time being, due to his unretirement and return to the Dallas Cowboys. Additionally in Australia the game was broaadcast for the second year in a row by Melbourne Radio Station 1116 SEN and commentated by Gerard Whateley.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the game was broadcast on the free-to-air channel BBC One, and paid-subscription channels Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Mix and Sky Sports USA.\nEntertainment.\nThe musical artists who agreed to perform at the show—including Gladys Knight, Maroon 5, Travis Scott, and Big Boi—were criticized by media outlets, other artists and members of the public for performing at Super Bowl LIII because of the NFL's alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the pre-game national anthem. Several artists, including Jay-Z and Cardi B, turned down offers to perform at the game in support of Kaepernick.\nQuinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies became the first male cheerleaders to perform at a major US sporting event. Scott Winer was the first openly gay cameraman to film the Super Bowl.\nPre-game.\nThe NFL had Mercedes-Benz Stadium's retractable roof open for the pre-game ceremonies and closed it prior to kickoff.\nAtlanta natives Chloe x Halle performed \"America the Beautiful\". Gladys Knight, also from Atlanta, performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". D.C. resident Aarron Loggins performed a sign-language interpretation for both songs.\nBernice King—the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr.—and civil rights movement leaders Andrew Young and John Lewis participated in the coin toss ceremony. King had the honors of flipping the coin.\nHalftime show.\nOn January 13, 2019, the NFL announced that pop band Maroon 5 would headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show. They were joined by Big Boi of Outkast and Travis Scott as guests. A short clip featuring the cast of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" and a clip from the 2001 episode \"Band Geeks\" was aired as a tribute to series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died in November 2018 due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The full clip of the \"Sweet Victory\" song, including a dedication to Hillenburg, was played inside the stadium prior to the game.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nThe Patriots received first possession as Cordarrelle Patterson returned the opening kickoff 38 yards to the Patriots' 39-yard line and the team picked up 27 yards with their next five plays. On quarterback Tom Brady's first pass attempt of the day, cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who was notable for a non-call on pass interference in the NFC Championship two weeks earlier, deflected a pass intended for wide receiver Chris Hogan, allowing linebacker Cory Littleton to make an interception, setting the Rams up at their own 27-yard line. The turnover had no avail, as the Patriots forced a three-and-out and the game's first punt. The Patriots drove 45 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 19-yard catch by tight end Rob Gronkowski. Placekicker Stephen Gostkowski missed a field goal attempt from 46 yards, still keeping the game scoreless. The Rams picked up a first down at the Patriots' 49-yard line on the very next play but were again unable to move the ball beyond that point and again, the Patriots threatened to score when Brady completed a 25-yard pass to Julian Edelman at the Rams 45-yard line. But on the next play, Brady was strip-sacked by Rams defensive end John Franklin-Myers, but Patriots center David Andrews recovered the fumble. However, the team was only able to get as far as the Rams' 40 before fourth down and had to punt with 18 seconds left in the first quarter.\nAfter forcing another three-and-out to start the second quarter, the Patriots managed to drive 39 yards in seven plays, most of which came from another 25-yard completion from Brady to Edelman. Gostkowski finished the possession with a 42-yard field goal, giving New England a 3–0 lead with 10:29 left in the second quarter. After the next three drives ended in punts, the Patriots took the ball and drove 36 yards to the Rams 32-yard line. New England elected to go for a 4th-and-1 conversion instead of a field goal, but Brady's pass to Gronkowski was broken up by safety John Johnson, turning the ball over on downs with 1:13 left in the half. Los Angeles could not get the ball past midfield, so they punted it back to New England to end the half.\nThe two teams went into their locker rooms with the Patriots leading, 3–0, the second lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history and the lowest since the 2–0 halftime score in Super Bowl IX after the 1974 season. In the entire first half, the Rams had gained just 57 yards and two first downs, both record lows for coach Sean McVay. This was also the first time that McVay's Rams had ever been shut out in a first half.\nSecond half.\nThe defensive duel continued into the second half as both teams punted twice (one of them was a Super Bowl record 65-yard punt by the Rams' Johnny Hekker). With 6:33 left in the third quarter, the Rams opened their first drive of more than five plays and their first not to end in a punt, moving the ball 42 yards in 10 plays. On the third play of the drive, Rams quarterback Jared Goff completed a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Brandin Cooks and later made his first third-down conversion with an 18-yard pass to Robert Woods on 3rd-and-6. On 3rd-and-7 from the Patriots' 26-yard line, Goff was sacked for a 9-yard loss by Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower, but Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein was able to kick a 53-yard field goal, the second-longest in Super Bowl history, to tie the game at 3–3 with 2:11 left in the third quarter. It would be their only score. The Patriots took the ball back and drove to the Rams' 44-yard line but could not go any further and had to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter. For the first time in Super Bowl history, both teams had gone three quarters without scoring a touchdown.\nAfter forcing the Rams to punt, the Patriots mounted the longest drive of the game as Brady completed an 18-yard pass to Gronkowski, a 13-yard pass to Edelman, a 7-yard pass to running back Rex Burkhead and a 29-yard pass to Gronkowski, bringing them to the Rams' 2-yard line. Running back Sony Michel finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run for the game's only touchdown, extending his rookie postseason rushing touchdown record to six and giving New England a 10–3 lead with 7 minutes left in regulation. On the first play of Los Angeles' next drive, Goff completed a 19-yard pass to Cooks and later converted a 3rd-and-9 with an 11-yard throw to wide receiver Josh Reynolds. On the next play, his 17-yard completion to Woods moved the ball to the Patriots' 27-yard line. However, on the next play, Goff's potential game-tying touchdown pass to Cooks was broken up by cornerback Stephon Gilmore and safety Duron Harmon, and then Goff threw a pass that was intercepted by Gilmore on the 3-yard line with 4:17 remaining.\nThe Rams needed to force a punt or turnover; however, they were unable to contain the Patriots on the ground. On the second play of the Patriots' possession, Michel stormed through the line for a 26-yard run. After he picked up 10 more yards with his next two carries, Burkhead's 26-yard run gave the Patriots a first down on the Rams' 33-yard line. Three plays later, Gostkowski succeeded on a 41-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 13–3 lead with 1:12 left on the clock. Taking the ball back on their own 25, Goff completed a 10-yard pass to Woods, as well as completions to Cooks for gains of 24 and 21 yards, moving the ball to the Patriots' 30-yard line. With 8 seconds left, the Rams decided to kick a field goal, which would have been followed by an onside kick attempt, but Zuerlein missed wide left from 48 yards, securing the Patriots' sixth Super Bowl title.\nTotals.\nBrady completed 21 of 35 passes for 262 yards, with one interception. Edelman was his top target with 10 receptions for 141 yards, while Gronkowski made six receptions for 87 yards in his final game with the Patriots. Michel was the top rusher of the game with 94 yards and a touchdown. Gilmore had five solo tackles and an interception. Goff finished the day 19-for-38 passing, for 229 yards and an interception. Cooks was his top receiver with eight receptions for 120 yards. Littleton had 10 tackles (six solo) and an interception. Hekker punted nine times for 417 yards, an average of 46.3 yards per punt, and put five punts inside the 20. The Rams were only the second team in Super Bowl history to not score a touchdown, the first having been the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI after the 1971 season.\nBrady became the first player in NFL history to win six Super Bowls, surpassing Charles Haley's only NFL record of five. Brady, also, at age 41, became the oldest quarterback to win and appear in a Super Bowl (although he did not play, the oldest quarterback ever to appear in a Super Bowl was Steve DeBerg in Super Bowl XXXIII at the age of 45), and, at the time, Bill Belichick was the oldest coach to win a Super Bowl, at age 66, until Bruce Arians surpassed that record at age 68 in Super Bowl LV. Edelman was named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player, and he was the first wide receiver to win the award since Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII after the 2008 season. Despite holding the Rams to just three points, no Patriots defender received a vote.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\n1Completions/attempts&lt;br&gt;2Carries&lt;br&gt;3Long gain&lt;br&gt;4Receptions&lt;br&gt;5Times targeted\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LIII had seven officials. The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers. John Parry became the second referee in a row to retire after officiating the Super Bowl after Gene Steratore, who retired after Super Bowl LII.\nCelebration.\nOn the morning of February 5, the Patriots celebration duck boat parade was held in Boston, starting at Boylston Street and ending at City Hall Plaza. The date of the parade was unseasonably warm for New England. The high temperature for the day was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, with a low of 40. Temperatures in Boston during this time of year average in the mid to low 40's. It was attended by an estimated 1.5 million fans."

        "title": "Super Bowl LIV",
        "text": "Super Bowl LIV was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2019 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers, 31–20. The game was played on February 2, 2020, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, which is the home of the Dolphins. This was the eleventh Super Bowl hosted by the South Florida region and the sixth Super Bowl hosted at Hard Rock Stadium, which hosted 5 previous Super Bowls (XXIII, XXIX, XXXIII, XLI, XLIV)\nThis was the Chiefs' first Super Bowl victory since Super Bowl IV and their first NFL championship since joining the league in the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes led Kansas City to a 12–4 regular season record and the team's third Super Bowl appearance overall. With the emergence of quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, the 49ers finished the regular season with a 13–3 record and advanced to their seventh Super Bowl appearance overall.\nThe first half of the game was back and forth between both teams, with the game tied at 10 at halftime. In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a Robbie Gould field goal and a touchdown run by Raheem Mostert giving them a 20–10 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the final 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to Travis Kelce and Damien Williams, to take the lead just before the two-minute warning. The Chiefs then stopped the 49ers on defense, and a late touchdown run by Damien Williams, as well as a Kendall Fuller interception, sealed the victory and ended the Chiefs' 50-year championship drought as well as earning Andy Reid his first NFL championship as a head coach. Mahomes was named Super Bowl MVP, having completed 26 of 42 pass attempts for 286 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, as well as rushing for 29 yards and one touchdown.\nThe game's broadcast in the United States by Fox, along with the halftime show headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, was seen by an estimated 103 million viewers—a slight increase over Super Bowl LIII in 2019 (which had seen the smallest audience for the game in 10 years). Due to the seating capacity of Hard Rock Stadium, this game also had the fourth lowest attendance in Super Bowl history (behind Super Bowl I, Super Bowl LVIII, and Super Bowl LV the following year). This was the first time in four years that the Super Bowl did not feature the New England Patriots since they were eliminated in the wild-card round by the Tennessee Titans.\nThe 49ers and Chiefs rematched against each other four years later in Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. The Chiefs defeated the 49ers again, this time 25–22 in overtime.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host either Super Bowl LIII in 2019 or Super Bowl LIV. NFL owners voted on these cities in May 2016, with the first round of voting determining who would host Super Bowl LIII and the second round deciding the venue for Super Bowl LIV. The league had also originally announced in 2015 that Los Angeles would be eligible as a potential Super Bowl LIV site if there were a stadium in place and a team moved there by the start of the 2018 season.\nThe league opened the relocation window in January 2016, selecting the former St. Louis Rams to return to Los Angeles; their new stadium in Inglewood, California was, at the time of the vote, not scheduled to open until August 2019 (it began construction in November 2016, giving nearly three years to construct the stadium). This meant the new stadium was scheduled to be open in time for the game (and the league selected the relocating team just in time to be considered for Super Bowl LIV), but, under the current construction timetable, would require a waiver of league policy to host Super Bowl LIV, as the league does not allow stadiums in their first year of existence to host the Super Bowl to ensure stadium construction delays and unforeseen problems do not jeopardize the game. In May 2016, the league granted this waiver and confirmed that Los Angeles was still in consideration for Super Bowl LIV.\nThe two remaining finalists for Super Bowl LIV were Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, which last hosted Super Bowl XLIV in 2010; and Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, which last hosted Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. Miami was selected as the host site at the NFL owners meeting on May 24, 2016.\nDavid Grutman—founder of the popular LIV nightclub at Fontainebleau Miami Beach—stated that he had no issues with the coincidence of Miami hosting Super Bowl LIV, embracing it as free publicity. The club—which first opened in 2008, has regularly hosted professional athletes, and also operates a club and luxury seating section at Hard Rock Stadium—had been named in honor of the hotel first opening in 1954, and as an homage to New York City's Studio 54. Of the NFL's onerous enforcement of venues using league trademarks (such as \"Super Bowl\") for promotional purposes, Grutman stated that \"we don't write the words Super Bowl LIV on anything. This is their mark and their weekend, and we're just so happy that they're doing it in Miami.\"\nTeams.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nThe San Francisco 49ers finished the 2019 season with an NFC-best record under third-year head coach Kyle Shanahan. San Francisco's rise to the top came as a surprise to the league. They had finished the previous season and had not recorded a winning record since 2013.\nOne big reason for the 49ers' success was the emergence of quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Garoppolo began his career in 2014 as a backup to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, winning Super Bowls XLIX and LI. After two uneventful seasons, Garoppolo's playing time increased substantially in 2016, due to Brady's suspension and because of several large late-game leads. Garoppolo showed potential, with a 113.3 passer rating over a span of six games. The following season, with San Francisco struggling at , they traded a second-round draft pick for Garoppolo, who led the 49ers to five straight wins to finish the season. Although he missed most of the 2018 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament sustained vs. the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, Garoppolo recovered in time for the 2019 season, starting all 16 games.\nSan Francisco's offense finished second in the NFL in points scored (479) and fourth in yards (6,079). Garoppolo completed 69.1% of his passes (fourth in the NFL) for 3,978 yards and 27 touchdowns (fifth), with 13 interceptions. His top pass-catcher was tight end George Kittle, who caught 85 passes for 1,053 yards and five touchdowns. Other key targets included rookie Deebo Samuel (57 receptions, 807 yards, 159 rushing yards, six total touchdowns) and veteran Emmanuel Sanders (36 receptions, 502 yards, three touchdowns). The 49ers ground game was led by running back Raheem Mostert, who had bounced around five different teams in his first two seasons before settling into San Francisco in 2017. Although Mostert did not start any games in 2019, he led the team in rushing with 772 yards and eight touchdowns, with an average of 5.6 yards per carry, while also catching 14 passes for 180 yards and two more touchdowns. Running backs Matt Breida (623 rushing yards, 19 receptions) and Tevin Coleman (544 rushing yards, 21 receptions, 180 receiving yards, seven total touchdowns) also made big impacts on offense, while fullback Kyle Juszczyk made the Pro Bowl, catching 20 passes for 239 yards. San Francisco's offensive line was led by 13-year veteran tackle Joe Staley, a six-time Pro Bowl selection.\nThe 49ers defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest yards allowed (4,509) and first in fewest passing yards (2,707). The team had an outstanding defensive line, featuring linemen DeForest Buckner (61 tackles, 7.5sacks, four fumble recoveries), Arik Armstead (54 tackles, 10 sacks), Dee Ford (6.5 sacks), an off-season pickup from the Chiefs, and rookie Nick Bosa (47 tackles, nine sacks, two fumble recoveries). The linebackers were led by Fred Warner (team leading 118 tackles, three sacks, three forced fumbles) and Dre Greenlaw (64 tackles, one sack). Defensive back Richard Sherman led the team in interceptions with three, earning his fifth career Pro Bowl selection before adding two more interceptions in the playoffs.\nThis was the 49ers' seventh Super Bowl appearance and their first since Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens 34–31. The 49ers had a record in their previous six appearances. A sixth Super Bowl victory would have tied the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers with the most Super Bowl championships in the league.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs finished the 2019 season with a record under Andy Reid, who was serving in his 21st consecutive season as an NFL head coach. The 2019 season marked the Chiefs' fourth straight AFC West title and sixth playoff appearance in seven seasons under Reid.\nPatrick Mahomes, their first round draft pick from 2017, quarterbacked the team. Mahomes had previously won the NFL Most Valuable Player award in the 2018 season, when he threw for 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns as he led the Chiefs to a record, along with a trip to the AFC championship game. In 2019, the team had to overcome some important personnel losses. Two of their top players from 2018, running back Kareem Hunt and linebacker Dee Ford, played elsewhere in 2019, while Mahomes and wide receiver Tyreek Hill both missed several games with injuries. Still, the team was able to repeat a record and earn the No.2 seed.\nMahomes was selected for the 2020 Pro Bowl, despite missing two games due to a dislocated patella; he threw passes for 4,031 yards and 26 touchdowns with only five interceptions, and rushed for 218 yards and two touchdowns. In the two games Mahomes missed, backup Matt Moore filled in and threw for 659 yards and six touchdowns, with no interceptions. The Chiefs' passing attack was ranked second in the NFL. Mahomes' top receiver was Pro Bowl tight end Travis Kelce, who caught 97 passes for 1,229 yards and five touchdowns, making him the first NFL tight end to have four consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 yards in pass receptions. His other targets included Hill, who earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection despite missing four games, catching 58 passes for 860 yards and seven touchdowns, Sammy Watkins with 52 catches for 673 yards and three touchdowns, and Demarcus Robinson with 32 catches for 449 yards and three touchdowns. Rookie receiver Mecole Hardman added 26 catches for 538 yards and six touchdowns. On special teams, Hardman ranked third in the NFL in kickoff return yards (704) and fifth in return average (26.1 yards), while also returning 18 punts for 167 yards, earning him a Pro Bowl selection as a special teams returner. The Chiefs' running game was ranked 23rd in the league, led by Damien Williams, who was their leading rusher with 498 yards and five touchdowns, while also catching 30 passes for 213 yards and two more scores. LeSean McCoy also contributed 465 yards and four touchdowns, along with 28 receptions. Kicker Harrison Butker led the NFL in scoring (147 points) and field goals (34), while ranking sixth in field goal percentage (89.4%). The Chiefs' offense was ranked fifth in the NFL in points scored (451) and sixth in yards gained (6,067).\nKansas City's defense ranked seventh in league in points allowed (308). Their defensive line featured two Pro Bowl selections, Chris Jones, who recorded nine sacks, and Frank Clark who had eight sacks and three forced fumbles, along with Emmanuel Ogbah, who had 5.5 sacks in 10 games. Linebackers Anthony Hitchens and Damien Wilson led the team in tackles with 88 and 81, respectively. The Chiefs defense was bolstered late in the season when they claimed 16-year veteran linebacker Terrell Suggs off waivers from the Arizona Cardinals in week 14. Suggs finished the season with 4forced fumbles and 6.5 sacks. Tyrann Mathieu, in his first season with the Chiefs, tallied four interceptions, two sacks and 75 tackles, which was enough to earn his second career Associated Press first-team All-Pro selection as a defensive back. He was also listed second-team All-Pro as a safety. Rookie safety Juan Thornhill added three interceptions and 57 tackles, but was lost for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in week 17. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland had two interceptions and two fumble recoveries, which he returned for 114 yards and a touchdown.\nThis was the Chiefs' third Super Bowl appearance and their first since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. The Chiefs were in their two previous Super Bowl appearances: they lost Super BowlI in 1967 to the Green Bay Packers (35–10) and won Super Bowl IV in 1970, defeating the Minnesota Vikings 23–7. This was also Andy Reid's second Super Bowl appearance as a head coach, after Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005 when he was Philadelphia Eagles head coach, which they lost 24–21 to the New England Patriots. Entering Super Bowl LIV, Reid's 221 victories made him the head coach with the most wins without a Super Bowl championship since the advent of the Super Bowl game.\nPlayoffs.\nIn the playoffs, the 49ers earned a first-round bye as the NFC's first seed. In the , they defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 27–10. The 49ers dominated this game, outperforming the Vikings in time of possession (38:27–21:33), first downs (21–7), rushing yards (186–21) and total yards (308–147). In the , the 49ers led by 27–0 at half time over the Green Bay Packers on their way to a 37–20 win. San Francisco set the record for the fewest passes in an NFC championship victory, throwing the ball only eight times. Instead they relied mostly on their running game, with 42 rushes for 285 yards, including a franchise record 220 yards and four touchdowns by Raheem Mostert.\nMeanwhile, the Chiefs also had a first-round bye as the AFC's second seed. In the , they fell behind 24–0 to the Houston Texans, but rallied to take a 28–24 half time lead; they dominated the second half and ended with a 51–31 win. During the comeback, the Chiefs scored touchdowns on an NFL record seven consecutive drives, including five touchdown passes by Mahomes. Their next opponent was the 6th-seeded Tennessee Titans, who advanced to the AFC championship by beating the New England Patriots and Baltimore Ravens, mainly due to the dominating performance of running back Derrick Henry, who gained over 200 yards from scrimmage in each game. The Chiefs defeated the Titans, holding Henry to just 61 total yards, with negative yardage in the second half. Kansas City rallied back from a 17–7 deficit in the second quarter by scoring four unanswered touchdowns to win the game 35–24. Mahomes threw 294 yards and three touchdowns, and also led Kansas City in rushing with 53 yards on the ground, including a 27-yard touchdown scramble.\nPre-game notes.\nThe Chiefs were the designated home team for Super Bowl LIV, as the home team alternates between the two conferences annually. As the designated home team, the Chiefs elected to wear their standard red home jerseys with white pants. The 49ers wore their standard white away jerseys with gold pants. This was the first time two teams with red as a primary uniform color met in the Super Bowl. The 49ers reportedly sought special permission to wear their all-white third jersey combination, which would have required special approval from the league; approval was not granted.\nGambling establishments had the Chiefs as 1.5-point favorites to open and set the projected total points to 52.5. Both figures moved to 1 and 53 shortly thereafter.\n49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan joined his father Mike Shanahan as the first father-son duo to lead their teams to a Super Bowl as head coaches. The elder Shanahan previously won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII as head coach of the Denver Broncos.\n49ers offensive assistant Katie Sowers became the first woman and the first openly gay person to coach in any Super Bowl.\nHall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, who played for both teams during his NFL career, joked on Twitter saying: \"You heard from me first. I \"guarantee\" my team will win the Super Bowl!\"\nMarlins Park hosted Super Bowl Opening Night. Bayfront Park hosted Super Bowl Live, while the Miami Beach Convention Center hosted the Super Bowl Experience.\nTeam facilities.\nThe Chiefs used the Miami Dolphins practice facility in Davie and stayed at the JW Marriott Turnberry. The 49ers practiced at the University of Miami in Coral Gables and stayed at the JW Marriott Marquis.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LIV was televised by Fox, per the three-year rotation between CBS, Fox and NBC, the NFL's three network broadcast partners. The broadcast team for Fox consisted of Joe Buck on play-by-play and Troy Aikman on color commentary in their sixth and final Super Bowl together on Fox before their departures to ESPN in 2022. Buck's father Jack had announced the Chiefs' Super Bowl win 50 years prior for CBS Sports.\nFox Deportes aired the game in Spanish with Adrian Garcia-Marquez on play-by-play and Rolando Cantú as color commentator.\nProduction.\nSimilarly to its \"Thursday Night Football\" broadcasts, Fox produced its Super Bowl LIV broadcast in 1080p high definition with HLG high-dynamic-range color, upconverted to a 4K ultra-high-definition feed available through participating pay TV providers and the Fox Sports app on supported streaming devices. Fox ruled out a native 4K telecast, citing the intensive internal bandwidth requirements needed to process 4K camera feeds during a telecast of this scale. Fox also introduced a new on-air appearance for football telecasts (which also included Fox's XFL broadcasts that began the following weekend). Fox's new graphics included a new scoreboard, which also included real-time quarterback and rushing statistics between plays, as well as the use of illustrated portraits of key players as opposed to photos.\nFox constructed a broadcast plaza in South Beach along Ocean Drive, which originated FS1's studio programs during the week leading up to the game and served as the main location for its pregame show. The campus also featured public activities such as the \"Fox VIP Screening Room\", a Lego sculpture gallery promoting the upcoming Fox series \"Lego Masters,\" and a \"The Masked Singer\"-themed ferris wheel.\nAdvertising.\nFox charged between $5 million and $5.6 million for 30 seconds of commercial time during Super Bowl LIV. On November 22, 2019, Fox announced that it had sold its entire in-game advertising inventory. As part of NFL initiatives to adjust and optimize commercial load during games, Fox aired four breaks per quarter rather than five, but each break was longer. Fox's executive vice president of sports sales Seth Winter said these changes had increased the early demand for commercial time during the game.\nTwo candidates in the 2020 presidential election bought spots during the game, including the presidential election campaigns of Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg. The game fell on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, the first major contest of the 2020 Democratic primaries. It was reported that due to concerns from other advertisers, only Fox network promos would air alongside the political ads during their respective breaks. In contrast to its largest collection of Super Bowl ad buys in 2019, perennial sponsor Anheuser-Busch purchased only four 60-second spots, fewer than previous years.\nThe Super Bowl Ad Meter survey conducted by \"USA Today\" was won by a \"Groundhog Day\"-themed spot for the Jeep Gladiator (tying into the game itself falling on Groundhog Day), starring Bill Murray. The A.V. Club chose as the best ad of the night one for attorney Darryl Isaacs, whose law firm paid for a large-budget space opera homage. \nLead-out programs.\nOn May 13, 2019, Fox announced that its lead-out program would be the season three premiere of \"The Masked Singer\".\nStreaming.\nDigitally, the game was available via Fox Sports' streaming platforms, the Yahoo! Sports mobile app and the NFL mobile app. The Yahoo! Sports app and stream was part of a long-term deal between the NFL and Verizon Media.\nRadio.\nNationally, Westwood One broadcast the game in the United States. Kevin Harlan, the Chiefs' radio broadcaster from 1985 to 1993, called the play-by-play, joined in the booth by Kurt Warner on color commentary; Laura Okmin and Tony Boselli contributed sideline reports, while Gene Steratore served as rules analyst.\nLocally, each team's flagship station, KNBR/KSAN in San Francisco and KCFX in Kansas City (all Cumulus Media stations), also carried the game in their local metropolitan areas. For Kansas City, Mitch Holthus was on play-by-play with Kendall Gammon on color commentary and B.J. Kissel with sideline reports, while San Francisco had Greg Papa on play-by-play with Tim Ryan on color commentary. By coincidence, it was KCFX's last Chiefs game under a 30-year-long contract, as the team's games moved to Entercom's WDAF-FM in the 2020 season.\nViewing statistics.\nFox reported an overall digital, broadcast and subscription audience of 102 million, an increase of 1.3 million from Super Bowl LIII. Nielsen Ratings measured 99.9 million viewers to the main Fox broadcast, also up from the 98.2 million who had watched Super Bowl LIII on CBS, while the Fox Deportes Spanish broadcast drew 310,000 viewers. An uptick to 103 million was noted during the halftime show. Viewership declined at a rate of approximately 5 million viewers per hour over the course of the game.\nInternational.\nIn Canada, Super Bowl LIV was televised by CTV, TSN, RDS (in French) and DAZN. In December 2019, considering an appeal of a prior decision at the request of Bell Media, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned a ruling that had allowed the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to restrict use of the simultaneous substitution (simsub) regulations for the Super Bowl in order to allow access to the U.S. commercials (which they had deemed, by public response, to be an integral part of the telecast). The court held that the CRTC's exception in policy overstepped its power under the Broadcasting Act, citing that it does not allow the CRTC to \"impose terms and conditions on the distribution of programming services generally\".\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the game was televised on the free-to-air channel BBC One and paid-subscription channels Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Mix. In Italy, it was on the free-to-air Italian channel Canale 20 and paid-subscription channel DAZN. In Latin America, the game was broadcast by ESPN and Fox Sports. In Brazil, Super Bowl LIV was televised by ESPN Brasil and exhibited in the movie theatre chains Cinemark, UCI and Kinoplex. In Australia, the game was televised on the free-to-air Seven Network and pay TV ESPN Australia (with Seven airing the Fox feed and ESPN using a secondary broadcast produced by ESPN International with the \"Monday Night Football\" commentary team of Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland, in what would be their final game due to a major revamp of the \"MNF\" booth the following season). It was also broadcast on Melbourne radio network 1116 SEN and commenated by Gerard Whateley for the third straight year. In Germany, the game was televised on the free-to-air German channel Prosieben and paid-subscription channel DAZN. In France, the game was broadcast on TF1 for the second consecutive year and by the paid-subscription channel BeIN Sports. In Sweden, the game was broadcast on free-to-air channel TV6.\n9.55 million viewers watched the Canadian broadcast and 3.66 million watched the Mexican broadcast. 18 million Canadians and 12 million Mexicans watched at least one minute of the game.\nEntertainment.\nPre-game ceremonies.\nThe game was held one week after the Calabasas helicopter crash that killed former basketball star Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others. The victims were honored in a tribute, with 49ers and Chiefs players lined up at opposite 24-yard lines in homage to Bryant's jersey number 24. Also honored was former All-Pro defensive end Chris Doleman, who died from glioblastoma five days earlier.\nPlayers and coaches selected to the NFL's 100th Anniversary All-Time Team were introduced in an on-field ceremony. Those living members in attendance wore red jackets with the NFL's 100th anniversary patch on them.\nYolanda Adams performed \"America the Beautiful\", while Demi Lovato performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\nFour 100-year-old World War II veterans participated in the coin toss ceremony: Colonel Charles E. McGee, Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Lombardo, Staff Sergeant Odón Sanchez Cardenas and Corporal Sidney Walton. McGee had the honors of presenting the coin.\nHalftime show.\nThe halftime show was led by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. Guests performers J Balvin and Bad Bunny featured during the show, as well as Lopez's daughter, Emme Muñiz. Lopez's five outfits were designed by Versace and her styling team designed 213 costumes and 143 pairs of shoes for Lopez and her dancers. Shakira's three outfits were by Norwegian designer Peter Dundas and featured nearly 2 million Swarovski crystals. The show was produced by NFL Network, Jay-Z and Roc Nation. The primary sponsor was Pepsi.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nSan Francisco won the coin toss and deferred, allowing the Chiefs to start with the ball. After forcing the Chiefs to punt on the opening drive, San Francisco drove 62 yards in 10 plays, including a 32-yard run by receiver Deebo Samuel. Robbie Gould finished the drive with a 38-yard field goal to give the 49ers a 3–0 lead. Kansas City responded by driving 75 yards in 15 plays. Patrick Mahomes completed five of seven passes for 40 yards on the drive, while Damien Williams rushed four times for 26 yards. Mahomes scored on a one-yard touchdown run to give the Chiefs a 7–3 lead with 31 seconds left in the first quarter.\nOn the second play of the second quarter, a heavy pass rush forced 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to throw a hurried pass that was intercepted by defensive back Bashaud Breeland, giving Kansas City a first down on their own 44-yard line. Mahomes completed a 28-yard pass to Sammy Watkins on the next play, sparking a 43-yard drive that ended with Harrison Butker kicking a 31-yard field goal, giving the Chiefs a 10–3 lead. San Francisco responded by moving the ball 80 yards in seven plays, with five plays gaining more than 10 yards each. On the last play, Garoppolo threw the ball to fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who managed to make the catch through tight coverage by safety Daniel Sorensen, break a tackle attempt by Sorensen and then dive into the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown. The game was tied at 10–10 with five minutes left in the half. After a Kansas City punt, Garoppolo's 42-yard pass to George Kittle could have set San Francisco up in the red zone, but that was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty against Kittle. With the penalty pushing them back to their own 35-yard line, the 49ers let the remaining six seconds expire to end the half with the score tied 10–10, the fourth time a Super Bowl had been tied at the midway point.\nSecond half.\nSan Francisco took the second half kickoff and drove 60 yards in nine plays, with Emmanuel Sanders catching two passes for 20 yards, Samuel rushing for 14 yards and Juszczyk hauling in a 14-yard reception. Gould finished the drive with a 42-yard field goal, giving the 49ers a 13–10 lead. Linebacker Fred Warner intercepted Mahomes on the next drive, returning it three yards to the San Francisco 45-yard line. Garoppolo started the ensuing drive with a 16-yard pass to Samuel. Three plays later, on 3rd-and-8, he threw a 26-yard pass to receiver Kendrick Bourne and then followed it up with a 10-yard pass to Juszczyk on the Chiefs 1-yard line. Raheem Mostert ran the ball into the end zone on the next play, increasing the 49ers' lead to 20–10 with 2:35 left in the third quarter.\nOn Kansas City's next drive, they drove the ball to the 49ers 23-yard line. On a 3rd-and-6, Mahomes threw a pass intended for Tyreek Hill that was slightly behind the receiver. Hill tried to reach back for it, but the ball bounced off his arm and was intercepted by cornerback Tarvarius Moore, who returned it seven yards to the 49ers 20-yard line with 11:57 left in the game. After the Chiefs defense rallied to force a punt, Kansas City got the ball with 8:53 left in the game and went on to score touchdowns on their next three drives. First, they moved the ball 62 yards in 10 plays. After a challenge by San Francisco succeeded in overturning a completed pass, the Chiefs faced 3rd-and-15 with 7:13 left in the game. Mahomes called the play \"Jet Chip Wasp\", which resulted in a 44-yard completion from Mahomes to Hill from the Chiefs 35-yard line. Two plays later, Moore committed pass interference while trying to cover tight end Travis Kelce in the end zone, moving the ball 20 yards to the 49ers one-yard line, and Mahomes threw to Kelce for a touchdown on the next play. San Francisco had to punt after three plays and Kansas City quickly stormed back for another score, advancing 65 yards in seven plays, the longest a 38-yard completion from Mahomes to Watkins. On 3rd-and-goal from the 49ers 5-yard line, Mahomes threw the ball to Williams, who just managed to stretch the ball across the goal line before going out of bounds. The touchdown was a close call, but was upheld by a booth review, giving Kansas City a 24–20 lead with 2:44 remaining in the game.\nWith the chance to mount a game-winning drive, the 49ers drove to the Chiefs 49-yard line but turned the ball over on downs after three incomplete passes and Garoppolo getting sacked on 4th-and-10 by Chiefs linebacker Frank Clark with 1:33 left in the game. Trying to run out the clock with the ground game, Williams carried the ball on the next two plays, first picking up four yards and then went the distance for a 38-yard touchdown, increasing Kansas City's lead to 31–20 with 1:12 remaining and essentially putting the game away. Chiefs defensive back Kendall Fuller made an interception on the 49ers' following drive, allowing the Chiefs to run out the clock and secure the Super Bowl, their first in 50 years and second overall.\nPostgame.\nMahomes finished the game with 26 completions on 42 attempts for 286 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions, while also rushing for 29 yards and a touchdown, gaining him the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award (MVP). He joined Terry Bradshaw and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to win the MVP despite throwing multiple interceptions. Mahomes was the youngest player ever to win the award at 24 years and 138 days. He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl, after Doug Williams in Super Bowl XXII and Russell Wilson in Super Bowl XLVIII.\nOther notable statistical performances included Hill's nine receptions for 105 yards and Watkins' five catches for 98 yards. Williams was the top rusher of the game with 17 carries for 104 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 29 yards and another score. For San Francisco, Garoppolo completed 20 of 31 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. Samuel had three carries for 53 yards, setting the Super Bowl record for rushing yards by a wide receiver, and caught five passes for 39 yards.\nWith this win, Kansas City became the first NFL team to come back from a 10-point (or more) deficit in three playoff games in the same season. The Chiefs Super Bowl win also completed a ten-year stretch in which each current Missouri-based team in the four major American sports leagues won a title (joining the St. Louis Cardinals, who won the 2011 World Series; the Kansas City Royals, who won the 2015 World Series; and the St. Louis Blues, who won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals). In addition, Sporting Kansas City, Kansas City's Major League Soccer franchise, won the MLS Cup in 2013.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\nCompletions/attemptsCarriesLong gainReceptionsTimes targeted\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LIV had seven officials.

        "title": "Cockermouth Cricket Club",
        "text": "Cockermouth Cricket Club was founded in 1823 in the historic market town of Cockermouth. That year is on the club's crest along with \"The Daffodils\" (of William Wordsworth fame), Cockermouth Castle and the club colours of green and gold. The early years saw the club renting its Sandair home from the wealthy Senhouse family. It is commonly misconceived that the club played on the grounds in front of the large Senhouse mansion at one time but Cockermouth Cricket Club have, in its long history, only ever had one ground; Sandair. This was eventually purchased from the Senhouse family and became property of the club. Many photographs which adorn the walls of the current Sandair pavilion are testament to the growing interest in the area during the Victorian era. In particular, a photograph of Cumberland versus Westmorland exists from the late 1800s fixture on the Sandair Ground.\n1900 to 1950.\nWithin this period, the club's facilities developed dramatically. Initially, the Player's Pavilion was located on the Gote Road side of the playing area (opposite where the modern day pavilion is). Eventually though, the pavilion transferred to the side of the ground where it is today, albeit in a smaller guise than the modern building. Two changing rooms, tea rooms and toilet facilities are what comprised the early pavilion. There was no vehicle access to the pavilion at this time so players walked across the playing area to access the pavilion.\nIt was around this time that two families whose names were to become synonymous with the Sandair club became involved with the club. The Denhams and the James. Several members of these families are honoured either by memorial plaques or by life membership of the club.\n1950 to 2000.\nDuring this golden period for the club on the field, facilities improved greatly and several members of the club came to prominence both on and off the field. In terms of facilities, further pavilion developments saw: a licensed bar introduced, changing room expansions, kitchen improvements and outdoor toilets moved inside.\nMany individuals have shaped the Cockermouth Club over the past 75 years. Some have stayed at the club for a short while, others for longer. Either way, the ethos and tradition laid down over many years has shaped the way that the club conducts itself even in the modern era.\nThe first of these individuals is Raymond Glover Layton Denham. J.D. as he is commonly known, played for the club First and Second XI's, captaining the latter in the late 1970s / early 1980s. In his heyday, Denham bowled leg-cutters and was a hard-hitting lower order batsman. His service to the club both during and since his playing days has been immeasurable. The Sandair Ground would not be anything like the standard it is today were it not for his hard work. Even in winter, barely a day goes by without Raymond Denham doing some work on the ground or with the machinery in the garages adjoining the ground.\nMaurice Andrews played mainly for the club's Second XI although he did move frequently between the Firsts and Seconds depending on selection at the time. He was noted for having a 'rocket arm', which could reach the stumps from anywhere on the ground. He also once recorded the incredible figures of 1 over 0 maidens 18 runs and 3 wickets during a fixture against Edenhall. It was after his playing career finished that Maurice's most notable work for the club took place. As treasurer, he single-handedly raised thousands of pounds for the club through a variety of channels; especially enjoying the traditions of raffle draws and 'pie and pea' fixtures.\nMost notable of the luminaries in a playing sense is Ken White, father of current club Captain Gareth. In a remarkable First XI career, which started as a 15-year-old in 1957, Ken played for the Firsts in the: 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s; a career spanning six decades, in which over 25,000 First XI runs and well over 1,000 First XI wickets were taken. Ken also captained the Firsts for 14 years winning several Cumberland Senior League Division One titles, Burton Cups and also to the club's first ever Meageen (County) Cup crown in 1966.\nGeorge Todhunter is the man who has been fundamental in the club's organisation and development over the past 25 years or so. Without his endeavours, the facilities players and spectators enjoy today, would be simply in the pipeline. From the 1970s onwards, George's expertise in architecture and design have helped the pavilion facilities develop into a thoroughly modern area. The 2009 floods, which decimated Sandair, saw George undertaking a variety of jobs. The whole ground was re-laid, partly funded by grants sourced by George and pavilion and flood defence work, in order to prevent future damage, was implemented in time for the club to start the 2010 season back on their home ground."

        "text": "Brendan Austin Rodgers (born August 9, 1996) is an American professional baseball second baseman for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was drafted third overall by the Rockies in the 2015 MLB draft.\nEarly life.\nBrendan Austin Rodgers was born on August 9, 1996, in Winter Park, Florida, to Greg and Julie Rodgers, owners of an apparel and promotions company. Rodgers' father and his two brothers both played soccer, and he only began playing baseball at the urging of a neighbor. He grew up playing on youth baseball teams with Bo Bichette, the son of Major League Baseball (MLB) player Dante Bichette, and when Rodgers was five years old, the elder Bichette told his parents that he had \"a serious future in baseball\". After playing second base during his first year at Lake Mary High School, Rodgers switched to shortstop for the next three seasons. During his senior season at Lake Mary, Rodgers batted .368 with eight home runs and 23 runs batted in (RBI). Outside of his high school team, Rodgers played for the Orlando Scorpions, a traveling team previously attended by Chris Sale, Zack Greinke, and Jonathan Lucroy.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Colorado Rockies selected Rodgers out of high school with the third overall pick of the 2015 MLB Draft. He had previously committed to playing college baseball for the Florida State Seminoles, but he signed with the Rockies on June 17 for a $5.5 million signing bonus. After signing, Rodgers began his professional baseball career with the Grand Junction Rockies, a Rookie-level team in the Pioneer League. He played there for the entire 2015 season, batting .273 with three home runs and 20 RBI in 37 games and 143 at bats. Rodgers was promoted to the Low-A Asheville Tourists for the 2016 season, where he impressed manager Warren Schaeffer by batting .358 with seven home runs and 27 RBI through the first month of the South Atlantic League season. This included his first career grand slam on May 7 during a 16–7 Asheville victory over the Delmarva Shorebirds. He played 110 games in Asheville, batting .281 with 19 home runs and 73 RBI in 442 at bats.\nHe spent 2017 with both the Lancaster JetHawks and the Hartford Yard Goats, batting a combined .336 with 18 home runs, 64 RBIs and a .940 OPS in 89 games between both teams. In 2018, he played for both Hartford and the Albuquerque Isotopes, compiling a combined .268 batting average with 17 home runs and 67 RBIs in 114 games.\nColorado Rockies.\nHe opened the 2019 season back with Albuquerque. On May 17, 2019, Rodgers' was promoted to the major leagues for the first time. He made his major league debut that night versus the Philadelphia Phillies.\nRodgers only appeared in 7 games in the pandemic shortened 2020 season for the Rockies, before landing on the injured list due to lingering problems in his right shoulder. In late 2021 Spring Training, Rodgers suffered a strained hamstring, requiring at least a month of recovery.\nOn June 1, 2022, Rodgers enjoyed his first career three home run game. His third home run in the contest was a walk-off home run off of Cole Sulser to defeat the Miami Marlins, 13-12. In 2022 he led the NL in double plays grounded into (25), and batted .266/.325/.408.\nOn February 28, 2023, in a spring training game against the Texas Rangers, Rodgers suffered a dislocated left shoulder that jeopardized the start to his season."

        "title": "2016 World Series",
        "text": "The 2016 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2016 season. The 112th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians, the first meeting of those franchises in postseason history. The series was played between October 25 and November 2 (although Game 7 ended slightly after 12:00 am local time on November 3). The Indians had home-field advantage because the AL had won the 2016 All-Star Game. This was the final World Series to have home-field advantage determined by the All-Star Game results; since , home-field advantage has been awarded to the team with the better record. Many consider the 2016 World Series to be one of the greatest World Series of all time, due to the underdog story behind both teams, the games being tightly contested, the series going the full distance, and game 7 going to extra innings.\nThe Cubs defeated the Indians 4–3 to capture their first World Series championship since 1908, and their first while playing at Wrigley Field. The deciding seventh game, won by Chicago 8–7 in ten innings, was the fifth World Series Game 7 to go into extra innings, and the first since 1997 (which, coincidentally, the Indians also lost). It was also the first Game 7 to have a rain delay, which occurred as the 10th inning was about to start. The Cubs became the sixth team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series. \nThe Cubs, playing in their 11th World Series overall and their first since 1945, won their third championship and first since 1908, ending the longest championship drought in North American professional sports history. It was the Indians' sixth appearance in the World Series and their first since 1997, with their last Series win having come in 1948. Cleveland manager Terry Francona, who had previously won World Series titles with the Boston Red Sox in 2004 and 2007, fell short in his bid to become the third manager to win his first three trips to the Fall Classic, after Casey Stengel and Joe Torre.\nThe 2016 World Series was highly anticipated; the two teams entered their matchup as the two franchises with the longest World Series title droughts, a combined 176 seasons without a championship. At the series' conclusion, numerous outlets listed Game 7 as an instant classic, and the entire Series as one of the greatest of all time. It would also mark the Indians' last World Series appearance with that nickname, as they changed their name to the \"Cleveland Guardians\" in 2022.\nBackground.\nChicago Cubs.\nThe Cubs made their 11th appearance in the World Series; their only previous two championships were in and . They lost their eight other appearances, in , , , , , , , and .\nThe Cubs qualified for the postseason by winning the National League Central, ending the regular season with the best record in all of MLB (103–58) for the first time since 1945; they also posted their highest winning percentage since 1935, and won their most games since 1910. The division title was their sixth since division play began in 1969, and their first since 2008. The Cubs entered the postseason as the No. 1 seed in the National League, and they defeated the 5th-seeded San Francisco Giants 3–1 of the NL Division Series before clinching their first NL pennant since 1945 with a 4–2 series win over the 3rd-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series.\nFor Cubs manager Joe Maddon, it was his second appearance in the World Series as manager – in , he managed the Tampa Bay Rays, who lost 4–1 to the Philadelphia Phillies. This made him the eighth person to manage pennant winning teams in both leagues.\nIt was also Maddon's third World Series appearance overall – in , he was bench coach for the Anaheim Angels.\nCleveland Indians.\nThe Indians made their sixth appearance in the World Series. They won two championships in and . They lost their three most recent appearances in the Fall Classic in , , and .\nThe Indians qualified for the postseason by winning the American League Central, their eighth division title and their first since 2007. The Indians were the #2 seed in the American League, and they defeated the 3rd-seeded Boston Red Sox 3–0 in the AL Division Series before clinching the pennant with a 4–1 victory over the 4th-seeded Toronto Blue Jays in the AL Championship Series.\nFor Indians manager Terry Francona, it was his third appearance in the World Series. He won his previous two appearances – 2004 and 2007 – as manager of the Boston Red Sox, in sweeps of the St. Louis Cardinals and the Colorado Rockies.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between Francona and Maddon. Maddon's Rays defeated Francona's Red Sox in the 2008 American League Championship Series, while Maddon's Rays defeated Francona's Indians in the 2013 American League Wild Card Game.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nFormer Indians and Cubs player Kenny Lofton threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 1 while Rachel Platten sang the national anthem. Corey Kluber started for the Indians, and Jon Lester started for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber, who had missed nearly all of the 2016 season after tearing ligaments in his left leg in the season's third game, was added to the Cubs' World Series roster and started as their designated hitter. Schwarber struck out twice, but also doubled and drew a walk. The double made Schwarber the first non-pitcher to get his first hit of the season in the World Series.\nKluber made World Series history by striking out eight hitters in the first three innings. Roberto Pérez became the first ever ninth-place hitter with two homers in a World Series game, the first Indians player to hit two homers in a Series game, and the first Puerto Rican-born player to hit two homers in a World Series game. In the first, the Indians loaded the bases off Lester on a single and two walks before José Ramirez's single drove in a run, then Lester hit Brandon Guyer with a pitch to force in another. Perez's home run in the fourth made it 3–0 Indians. In the eighth, Justin Grimm walked Guyer with two outs and allowed a single to Lonnie Chisenhall, then Hector Rondon allowed Perez's second home run of the night. Andrew Miller and Cody Allen finished the victory for the Indians despite Miller having to pitch out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, and the Indians took Game 1 of the series 6–0. Francona's World Series winning streak reached nine with this victory.\nLeading off the first inning, Dexter Fowler became the first African-American to play for the Cubs in a World Series.\nGame 2.\nFormer Indians player Carlos Baerga threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 while LoCash performed the national anthem. The start time for the game was moved up an hour, because of the possibility of heavy rain in the forecast. Looking to tie the series at one game apiece, the Cubs sent Jake Arrieta to the mound against the Indians' Trevor Bauer who was still healing a lacerated pinkie resulting from an accident with a drone. The Cubs also featured six players under age 25 in the starting lineup, a postseason record. The Cubs started things off early as Kris Bryant singled in the first inning and Anthony Rizzo doubled to score Bryant and give the Cubs an early 1–0 lead. Arrieta started well too, retiring the first two batters before walking back-to-back batters in the bottom of the first. However, Arrieta got a flyout to end the inning. The Cubs struck again in the third following a two-out walk by Rizzo and a single by Ben Zobrist. A single by Kyle Schwarber scored Rizzo from second and pushed the Cubs' lead to 2–0. Bauer was forced from the game in the fourth, and the Cubs struck again in the fifth. Rizzo walked again off Zach McAllister, and Zobrist tripled to plate Rizzo. Another run-scoring single by Schwarber off Bryan Shaw and a bases-loaded walk by Addison Russell pushed the lead to 5–0.\nArrieta continued to pitch well, walking three batters but holding the Indians without a hit into the sixth inning. In the sixth, a double by Jason Kipnis ended the no-hitter, moved to third on a groundout and scored the lone Indians run of the game on a wild pitch by Arrieta. Arrieta allowed another single and was lifted for reliever Mike Montgomery. Both teams threatened in the seventh but could not score and, following a single by Mike Napoli in the bottom of the eighth, Aroldis Chapman entered to finish the game for the Cubs. The win marked the Cubs' first World Series game victory since 1945 and tied up the series at one game all. The game marked Indians manager Terry Francona's first loss in ten World Series games.\nGame 3.\nFor Game 3, former Cubs player Billy Williams threw the ceremonial first pitch before the start of the game, Fall Out Boy lead singer Patrick Stump sang the national anthem, and Bill Murray sang \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" during the seventh-inning stretch, to mark the Cubs' first World Series night game at home. Chicago pitcher Kyle Hendricks started against Cleveland pitcher Josh Tomlin.\nThe game's only run came off a Coco Crisp single that scored Michael Martínez from third in the seventh inning. Josh Tomlin, Andrew Miller, Bryan Shaw, and Cody Allen combined to shut out the Cubs. Allen earned his sixth postseason save as Javier Báez struck out swinging to end the game, leaving the tying and winning runs in scoring position. It was the fourth time in which the Cubs had lost in a shutout during the 2016 postseason.\nGame 4.\nFor Game 4, former Cubs pitchers Greg Maddux and Ferguson Jenkins threw the ceremonial first pitches before the start of the game while Cubs anthem singer John Vincent sang the national anthem, and actor Vince Vaughn sang \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" during the seventh-inning stretch.\nThe Cubs struck first when Dexter Fowler doubled to lead off the first and scored on Anthony Rizzo's one-out single, but Kluber held them to that one run through six innings before Francona turned it over to the bullpen. In the second, Carlos Santana's leadoff home run off Lackey tied the game; then, with two on, Kluber's RBI single put the Indians up 2–1. Kris Bryant committed two errors in that inning. Next inning, Jason Kipnis hit a leadoff double and scored on Francisco Lindor's single. In the sixth, Lonnie Chisenhall's sacrifice fly with two on off Mike Montgomery made it 4–1 Indians. Next inning, Justin Grimm allowed a leadoff double and one-out hit-by-pitch before being relieved by Travis Wood, who gave up a three-run home run to Kipnis put to the Indians ahead 7–1. The Cubs got one run back in the eighth, on a Dexter Fowler home run off Andrew Miller, which was the first run he gave up in the post-season. With the victory, the Indians were just one win away from their 1st World Series championship since 1948.\nGame 5.\nFor Game 5, former Cubs star and Hall of Fame member Ryne Sandberg threw the ceremonial first pitch before the start of the game, former Cubs public address announcer Wayne Messmer performed the national anthem, and Eddie Vedder (a Chicago native and die hard Cubs fan) sang \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" during the seventh-inning stretch. José Ramírez hit a home run for Cleveland in the second inning off Jon Lester, but the Cubs, facing elimination, scored three runs in the fourth inning off Trevor Bauer. Kris Bryant led off the inning with a home run. After Bryant's home run, Anthony Rizzo doubled and Ben Zobrist singled. Addison Russell's RBI single put the Cubs up 2–1. After Jason Heyward struck out, Javier Baez's bunt single moved Zobrist to third before David Ross's sacrifice fly made it 3–1 Cubs. The Indians cut their deficit to 3–2 off Lester in the sixth on Francisco Lindor's RBI single that scored Rajai Davis from second base. With the tying run on second base in the seventh inning, Maddon brought in Aroldis Chapman, who threw scoreless innings, earning his first save of the series and fourth overall in the postseason. The win was the first World Series game victory for the Cubs at Wrigley Field since 1945.\nGame 6.\nThe last living member of Cleveland's 1948 World Series championship team, Eddie Robinson, attended Game 6 at Progressive Field. Former Indians pitcher Dennis Martínez threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the game while country singer Hunter Hayes sang the national anthem.\nThe Cubs scored three runs in the first inning, all with two outs, on a Kris Bryant home run and a two-run double by Addison Russell after two singles off Josh Tomlin. In the third inning, the Cubs loaded the bases on a walk and two singles off Tomlin, who was relieved by Dan Otero. Following the pitching change, Russell hit the 19th grand slam in World Series history to extend the Cubs lead to 7–0. Russell's grand slam was the first in a World Series game since Paul Konerko of the crosstown Chicago White Sox in , as well as the first by a visiting player since Lonnie Smith in . In the bottom of the fourth, Mike Napoli drove in Jason Kipnis, who doubled to lead off, with an RBI single to cut the deficit to 7–1. In the bottom of the fifth, Kipnis drove a ball over the left field wall for a home run to make it a 7–2 game. In the top of the ninth with a runner on and two outs, Anthony Rizzo hit a two-run home run to right to make it 9–2. In the bottom of the inning, Aroldis Chapman allowed a leadoff walk to Brandon Guyer and was relieved by Pedro Strop, who threw a wild pitch to move Guyer to second and Roberto Perez's RBI single made it 9–3 Cubs with Perez thrown out at second for the second out. After Carlos Santana walked, Travis Wood relieved Strop and got Jason Kipnis to pop out to short to end the game and force a Game 7.\nRussell's six RBIs tied a World Series single-game record. Arrieta became the first NL starting pitcher to notch two road wins in a single World Series since Bob Gibson in .\nGame 7.\nGame 7 of the series would go down as a classic, with some calling it the greatest Game 7 in World Series history, comparing it to 1924, 1960, 1991, 1997, and 2001 for its drama and tension. Former Indians player Jim Thome threw the ceremonial first pitch before the game while members of the Cleveland Orchestra string section performed the national anthem. The pitching matchup was between MLB earned run average (ERA) champion Kyle Hendricks, who had started Game 3 for the Cubs, and Corey Kluber, who had won games 1 and 4 and was pitching on three days' rest. Kluber came into the game 4–1 in the postseason with a 0.89 ERA.\nDexter Fowler led off the game with a home run for Chicago off Kluber, becoming the first player ever to hit a lead-off home run in a World Series Game 7. The Indians tied the game in the bottom of the third inning with an RBI single by Carlos Santana after Coco Crisp doubled and advanced to third on a Roberto Pérez sacrifice bunt. The Cubs scored two runs in the fourth inning with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Kris Bryant running aggressively to tag up from third on the short fly ball and slide under the tag at home) and a double by Willson Contreras. To start the fifth inning, Javier Báez hit a home run to center making it 4–1 on the first pitch he saw to knock Kluber out of the game. ALCS MVP Andrew Miller came on in relief and gave up a walk to Bryant and RBI single to Anthony Rizzo to push the lead to 5–1 (Bryant's aggressiveness again instrumental as he was attempting to steal second on the hit, allowing him to score all the way from first). In the bottom of the fifth inning, Hendricks retired the first two batters. A two-out walk to Santana, which included a pitch that was called a ball and appeared to be a strike, persuaded Joe Maddon to relieve both his starter and the catcher. This move, along with others throughout the series, would be highly criticized afterward, as it appeared to some that Hendricks was pulled out too soon.\nJon Lester, who had started Games 1 and 5, came on in relief for the first time since the 2007 ALCS, coincidentally also against the Indians. David Ross (who usually caught for Lester and was playing in his final game) committed a throwing error that allowed Jason Kipnis to reach base and put runners on second and third. A wild pitch that ricocheted off Ross's helmet allowed Santana and Kipnis to score, narrowing the Cubs' lead to 5–3. To atone for his blunders, the 39-year-old Ross hit a home run to center, in his last official at-bat of his career, in the top of the sixth to make it a 6–3 game, becoming the oldest player to hit a home run in a World Series Game 7.\nLester retired the first two batters in the eighth inning, but was pulled after a José Ramírez single that Russell did not field cleanly at short. Maddon opted to use Aroldis Chapman, who had thrown 42 pitches in Game 5 and had also pitched in Game 6, despite the fact that the Cubs had already built a large lead. Brandon Guyer promptly hit a run-scoring double off Chapman, making the score 6–4. The next batter was Indians center fielder Rajai Davis, who had hit 55 career home runs in 11 seasons entering this game, and who was hitting .132 in the postseason up to that point. Davis hit a dramatic 2-run home run off Chapman, just barely clearing the left field wall and the left field foul pole, scoring Guyer and tying the game, making the score 6–6. Davis's home run was the latest-occurring game-tying home run in World Series Game 7 history. Many fans and Chapman himself believe he blew the lead due to his unnecessary use in Game 6.\nThe Cubs squandered a scoring chance in the top of the 9th. Ross led off with a walk and Jason Heyward grounded into a fielder's choice to take pinch runner Chris Coghlan off the bases. Heyward stole second and advanced to third on a throw to second by Yan Gomes that got away from Kipnis. At this point Cleveland's Terry Francona made a defensive change in left, replacing Coco Crisp by inserting Michael Martinez in right and moving Guyer to left; this was eventually to backfire for the Indians. Javier Baez attempted a squeeze bunt with two strikes—another decision by Maddon which drew criticism—and fouled it off for the second out. Dexter Fowler would eventually ground out on a spectacular game-saving play by shortstop Francisco Lindor to end the top of the ninth. To the shock of many observers, Aroldis Chapman was asked by Maddon to return to the mound for the bottom of the ninth, but he promptly retired the Indians in order, facing Carlos Santana, Jason Kipnis, and Francisco Lindor.\nWith the game tied 6–6 after nine innings, a sudden cloudburst resulted in a 17-minute rain delay. During the delay, Cubs right fielder Heyward called his teammates into a weight room behind Chicago's dugout and told them, \"We're the best team in baseball... for a reason... Stick together and we're going to win this game.\" After the game, many of Heyward's teammates credited him with renewing their spirits.\nWhen play resumed in the top of the tenth, Kyle Schwarber promptly led off with a single off of Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw. Maddon replaced Schwarber with pinch-runner Albert Almora. Kris Bryant then hit a deep fly ball to center, and Almora tagged up and advanced to second base in what was called the \"savviest baserunning play of the season.\" After an intentional walk to Anthony Rizzo, Ben Zobrist stepped up to the plate. Zobrist had been 0-for-4 in the game, but he delivered a clutch RBI double into the left field corner, scoring Almora and breaking the tie, making the score 7–6. Zobrist later said, \"I was just battling, grinding up there. Fortunately, that last one he left over the plate and up to where I could just slap it down the line, and that was all I was trying to do.\"\nAfter another intentional walk to Addison Russell, Miguel Montero, who had replaced Ross at catcher and was hitting just .091 in the postseason, delivered another clutch single onto left, scoring Rizzo and making the score 8–6. Trevor Bauer, the losing pitcher of Games 2 and 5, relieved Shaw and got out of the bases-loaded jam by striking out Heyward and retiring Baez on a flyout to escape further damage.\nCarl Edwards Jr. was called on to finish off the Indians in the bottom of the tenth, but after retiring the first two hitters (Mike Napoli and José Ramírez), he walked Brandon Guyer, who took second base on defensive indifference. Rajai Davis, following up on his eighth-inning heroics, lined a single to center, making it a one-run game, and the score 8–7. Maddon then called on Mike Montgomery, who had zero career saves. Montgomery retired Michael Martinez (the replacement for Crisp who had scored the game-winning run in Game 3 but had struck out in his only two at-bats of the Series) with an infield grounder fielded by Bryant, who threw to Rizzo. This ended the game and the World Series, with the Cubs winning the series and ending their 108-year World Series championship drought. Zobrist was awarded the World Series MVP award after hitting .357 in the series and delivering the go-ahead hit.\nAfter Game 7.\nRizzo called the rain delay \"the most important thing to happen to the Chicago Cubs in the past 100 years. I don't think there's any way we win the game without it.\" Cubs president Theo Epstein said that when he heard about the meeting called by Heyward, \"Right then I thought, 'We're winning this game.'\"\nThe Cubs became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Series since the 1985 Kansas City Royals. They were also the first since the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates to do so while winning Games 6 and 7 on the road, and the second team since the 1979 Pirates to win Game 7 as the visiting team, with the 2014 San Francisco Giants also having achieved that feat in Kansas City; almost one year later, the 2017 Houston Astros did the same thing in Los Angeles. Yet another Game 7 would be won by a road team in , when the Washington Nationals did so in Houston. With the Game 7 victory, Joe Maddon is 3–0 in postseason series against Terry Francona, having also won the 2008 ALCS and the 2013 Wild Card Game against him. Game 7 was the 60th extra inning game in World Series history, and the fifth time a Game 7 went into extra innings. This was the first extra inning Game 7 to be won by the visiting team, as the home team won the previous four times in 1912, 1924, 1991, and 1997.\nWith the Cubs winning, the Indians became the owners of MLB's longest active championship drought, which stood at 68 years, and currently stands at 75 years. Their last title came in ; however, earlier in 2016, the Cleveland sports curse had already been broken, with the Cleveland Cavaliers having won the city's first championship since 1964 by defeating the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals.\nGame 7 of the 2016 World Series won the 2017 ESPY Award for Best Game.\nThis marked the last World Series in which the visiting team's championship presentation took place in the locker room instead of the playing field. Following the 2017 World Series, every World Series presentation would take place on the field, regardless of whether or not the home or road team won the championship.\nComposite line score.\n2016 World Series (4–3): Chicago Cubs (NL) beat Cleveland Indians (AL).\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFox televised the series in the United States, under contract with Major League Baseball giving it exclusive rights to the World Series through 2021. Joe Buck was the network's play-by-play announcer, with John Smoltz as color commentator and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Fox Deportes also aired the Series and provided a Spanish-language simulcast over-the-air via Fox's SAP audio, with Carlos Álvarez and Duaner Sánchez announcing.\nSportsnet in English and RDS in French televised the series in Canada. Sportsnet used the MLB International feed produced by the MLB Network; Matt Vasgersian was MLB International's play-by-play announcer with the Toronto Blue Jays' play-by-play announcer Buck Martinez as their color analyst and MLB Network correspondent Lauren Shehadi and analyst Mark DeRosa as field reporters. Alain Usereau and former Montreal Expos player Marc Griffin handled the French-language telecast for RDS. BT Sport televised the series live in the United Kingdom and Ireland. WAPA-TV transmitted the series to Puerto Rico, with Rafael Bracero at the helm of the station's sports commentary of the series.\nRatings.\nInitial reports often utilize \"fast national\" ratings, which are subject to revision. Game 7 had over 40 million viewers, the largest audience for a baseball game since Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, while the series as a whole was the first to average double-digit ratings nationally since .\nRadio.\nESPN Radio's national network covered the World Series through affiliated stations, with Dan Shulman providing the play-by-play and Aaron Boone serving as color analyst. Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer appeared as a guest analyst for select innings of Games 1 and 2.\nLocally, the teams' flagship stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers. In Cleveland, WTAM (1100) and WMMS (100.7) carried the Indians' play-by-play with Tom Hamilton and Jim Rosenhaus, while in Chicago, WSCR (670) carried the Cubs' play-by-play with Pat Hughes, Ron Coomer, and Len Kasper. The affiliate stations of the teams' regional radio networks were contractually obligated to carry the national ESPN Radio feed; even so, since both WSCR and WTAM are clear-channel stations, most of the eastern and midwestern United States was able to hear the local broadcasts.\nCelebration.\nFollowing the team's win in Game 7, Cubs fans congregated outside of Wrigley Field and the surrounding Wrigleyville neighborhood to celebrate the championship. On November 4, the team's victory parade began at Wrigley Field and headed down Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue at downtown for a noon rally at Grant Park. Country singer Brett Eldredge sang a cover of \"Go, Cubs, Go\" during the rally. The city of Chicago estimated that over five million people attended the World Series parade and rally celebration, making it one of the largest gatherings in history, and according to some sources, the largest gathering in the history of the United States. After the season, the Cubs chose to make two traditional White House visits during then-President (and White Sox fan) Barack Obama's final week in office on January 16, 2017, and during President Donald Trump's tenure on June 28, 2017.\nHistorical Notes.\n\"Back to the Future\" prediction.\nIn the 1989 film \"Back to the Future Part II\", the Chicago Cubs are depicted as the 2015 World Series champions, defeating a fictional American League team from Miami whose mascot is an alligator in four-game sweep starting October 17 and ending on October 21. The team now known as the Miami Marlins was not formed until four years later, with a billfish as a mascot. Screenwriter Bob Gale, who co-wrote the script of \"Back to the Future PartII\", originally intended it as a joke, saying \"Being a baseball fan, I thought, 'OK, let's come up with one of the most unlikely scenarios we can think of\", referencing both the Cubs' long championship drought and the fact that Florida did not have a baseball team in 1989. He also explained that the October 21 prediction was based on the postseason structure at the time of the writing of the film, and thus could have been accurate had MLB not added the Division Series in 1994 and Wild Card Game in 2012.\nThe film's prediction of the Cubs winning the World Series proved to be incorrect by one year, although it did pick the correct date on which the Cubs' 2015 season ended, when they lost to the New York Mets in a four-game sweep of the NLCS. The official \"Back to the Future\" Twitter account acknowledged this following the Cubs' win in 2016 by tweeting \"Way to go Cubbies\" and posting a still image from the film stating the same, and a follow-up tweet that said the 1994 players' strike, in which that year's World Series was canceled, caused a \"disruption in the space-time continuum\". Following the Cubs win, Michael J. Fox, star of the movie, reacted to the Cubs' win by tweeting \"Only off by a year, not bad\" and a congratulatory message to the Cubs organization.\nAftermath.\nCubs.\nThe 2015–2020 Cubs had the greatest sustained run of success since the dead-ball era, but the Cubs’ teams after 2016 would fail to return to the World Series. The 2017 Cubs returned to the NLCS, but lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. In 2018, the Cubs finished tied with the Milwaukee Brewers for the division, but lost the tie-breaker game and were relegated to the 2018 NL Wild Card Game against the Colorado Rockies, which the Cubs would lose, as well.\nIn addition, the Cubs' 2016 championship core slowly moved on via free agency, trade, or retirement:\nBy the 2021 trade deadline, the Cubs had fully committed to a re-build, as established players such as Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, and Javier Baez were traded away for young players and prospects. Many fans and media drew a comparison with the 2016 Cubs to the 1986 New York Mets, as both teams had a young core when they won a World Series, both clubs had staged thrilling comebacks to win their respective World Series in seven games, and they both looked like a start to a potential dynasty; however, neither would return to another World Series. \nAs of 2023, Kyle Hendricks is the last remaining member of Cubs' 2016 World Series team. Meanwhile, Soler won a second World Series ring with the Atlanta Braves in , even winning World Series MVP. Chapman won his second ring with the Texas Rangers in . Bench coach Dave Martinez later became a manager and skippered the Washington Nationals to its first World Series title in .\nIndians.\n2016 was also the high point for the Indians. The 2017 Indians won 22 straight games – the second-longest winning streak in MLB history – on their way to a 102–60 record and AL Central title. However, they lost to the New York Yankees in five games in the ALDS after taking a 2–0 series lead. The Indians won their division again in 2018, but were swept by the Houston Astros in the ALDS.\nDuring the 2020–21 off-season, the Indians had traded star shortstop Francisco Lindor, along with longtime rotation stalwart Carlos Carrasco, to the New York Mets. Currently, the only remaining player Cleveland's roster is José Ramírez. The 2016 win in the ALCS was the last postseason series victory for the team until the 2022 American League Wild Card Series. This would also mark the Indians' last World Series appearance with that nickname, as they changed their name to the \"Cleveland Guardians\" in 2022."

        "text": "The 2015 Dubai World Cup was a horse race held at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday 28 March 2015. It was the 20th running of the Dubai World Cup. It was the first running of the race since the synthetic Tapeta surface was replaced by a dirt track.\nThe winner was Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum's Prince Bishop, an eight-year-old bay gelding trained in Dubai by Saeed bin Suroor and ridden by William Buick. Prince Bishop's victory was the first in the race for his jockey, the seventh for his trainer and the first for his owner.\nThe contenders.\nThe return to dirt saw a strong North American challenge, headed by the American Horse of the Year California Chrome, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The other runners from the United States were Lea, the six-year-old winner of the 2014 Donn Handicap and the four-year-old Candy Boy (Robert B. Lewis Stakes), who had recently been transferred to race for a UAE-based stable. The two-horse Saeed bin Suroor/ Godolphin entry comprised African Story (winner of the race in 2014) and Prince Bishop, who was contesting the race for the fourth time, having finished tenth in 2011, seventh in 2013 and ninth in 2014. Japan sent two representatives; Hokku Tarumae, a dirt specialist who had won the Champions Cup and been named Champion Dirt Horse at the JRA Awards, and the Japan Cup winner Epiphaneia, rated the second-best racehorse in the world in the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings. The sole European runner was the much-travelled British eight-year-old Side Glance (whose biggest win had come in the 2013 Mackinnon Stakes) and the nine-runner field was completed by the locally trained American import Long River. Betting is illegal in Dubai, but British bookmakers made California Chrome the 5/4 favourite ahead of Lea (4/1) and Epiphaneia (13/2). African Story and Hokku Tarumae were next in the market on 8/1 ahead of the 14/1 shot Prince Bishop.\nThe race.\nHokko Tarumae broke quickly and set the pace in the early stages from African Story, California Chrome (racing four wide) and Long River with Prince Bishop detached from the rest of the field in last place. The Japanese horse maintained his advantage on the back straight and approached the final turn with the lead from California Chrome, African Story and Lea as Prince Bishop made rapid progress on the outside. By this point Long River, Side Glance and Epiphaneia were beaten, whilst Candy Boy was staying on but well behind the leading five. Entering the straight, California Chrome moved up to challenge Hokko Tarumae, but both horses were overtaken by Prince Bishop who quickly went into a clear lead. In the final stages Hokko Tarumae and African Story faded whilst Lea and Candy Boy made steady progress. Prince Bishop extended his advantage to win by two and three quarter lengths from California Chrome, with Lea one and quarter lengths back in third. There was a five length gap back to Candy Boy, who took fourth by a short head from Hokko Tarumae, with another four lengths back to African Story. Long River, Side Glance and Epiphaneia finished seventh, eighth and ninth at long intervals.\nWinner's details.\nFurther details of the winner, Prince Bishop"

        "text": "The Southland Bowling League (SBL) was a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bowling-only conference. The SBL was founded in 2015 for schools that sponsor women's bowling teams, but did not have bowling sponsored by their primary conferences. The SBL champion received an automatic bid to the NCAA Bowling Championship since the NCAA first awarded such bids in 2018. While the conference operated independently, administrative services were provided by the Southland Conference. The SBL merged into Conference USA (CUSA) after the 2022–23 season, with CUSA inheriting the SBL's automatic championship berth.\nThe SBL received at least three bids to the NCAA Championship in each season of its existence. Following the inaugural SBL Championship, four league teams (Arkansas State, Sam Houston State, Stephen F. Austin, and Vanderbilt) received at-large bids to the 2015 NCAA Championships, filling half of the eight available spots. The same four teams would receive at-large bids to the 2016 NCAA Bowling Championships and 2017 NCAA Bowling Championships. In 2018, the first year for automatic bids to the NCAA Championship and also the first year for a 10-team championship event, Vanderbilt earned the automatic bid and Arkansas State and Sam Houston received at-large bids. In 2019, Sam Houston State earned the automatic bid, while Arkansas State, Stephen F. Austin, and Vanderbilt received at-large bids. In 2021, Vanderbilt earned the automatic bid, while Arkansas State, Louisiana Tech, Sam Houston, and Youngstown State received at-large bids. In 2022, six of the eight members made the NCAA Bowling Championships field with Vanderbilt earning the automatic bid, while Arkansas State, Louisiana Tech, Sam Houston State, Stephen F. Austin, and Youngstown State all receiving at-large bids. In the league's final season in 2023, the same six members from 2022 made the NCAA Bowling Championships field, with Arkansas State earning the automatic bid.\nIn July 2021, it was announced that Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin left the Southland for the Western Athletic Conference. After the two schools announced they would join the WAC in fall 2022, they were expelled by the Southland Conference and joined the WAC a year ahead of the originally planned schedule. Despite leaving the Southland Conference in all other sports, Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin remained in the SBL and both participated in the 2022 and 2023 SBL Championships.\nFinal members.\nAll of the SBL's final members now compete in CUSA bowling.\nOn August 7, 2018, the SBL and Youngstown State University announced that Youngstown State's bowling program was joining the league for competition beginning in the 2018–2019 season. Youngstown State replaced Monmouth, who accepted an invitation to join the MEAC.\nNCAA Bowling Championship participation.\n\"Source:\"\nBold: Champion&lt;br&gt;\nItalics: Runner-Up"

        "text": "Amsterdam Basketball was a Dutch professional basketball club from the city of Amsterdam, established in 1995 and dissolved in 2011. The club won the Dutch championship seven times and the Dutch Cup five times.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1995–1997).\nAfter it was announced that the Graydons Canadians, a team from Amsterdam would not participate in the Eredivisie of 1995–96, Ed de Haas, Carlo Brunink and Oscar Kales founded the club. The club immediately started playing in the highest division in the Netherlands, and was named \"Finish Profiles Amsterdam\" after the new main sponsor. In the first season Tyrone Marionneaux was the head coach and Finish Profiles ended on a 9th place.\nIn the 1996–97 Jan Willem Jansen became head coach and new players like Mario Bennes were acquired, which led to the team winning the NBB Cup and reaching the league Finals. The club also played for the first season with the name Amsterdam Astronauts, which referred to the home arena of the club, the Apollohal.\nFirst European games and Dutch titles (1997–2002).\nIn 1997–98 the club debuted in Europe and started a second team, that would play in the Promotiedivisie. From that point some good years for the club began, as one of the all-time great coaches in Dutch basketball history Ton Boot started coaching the team. In the 1998–99 season the club won its first Dutch championship and reached the semifinals of the Korać Cup, in which it lost to Racing Basket Paris. In that semifinals the team played against later NBA All-Star Tony Parker.\nIn the 2000–01 season the 3rd straight Dutch title was one.\nBefore the 2001–02 season the club moved to Sporthallen Zuid, which had a capacity of 3,000. Another championship was won in the Sporthallen. The club had a tough season the following year, as newly formed EiffelTowers Nijmegen took the trophies.\nGolden Years (2003–2009).\nIn the 2003–04, season Israeli head coach Arik Shivek became head coach of Amsterdam, and some memorable players were acquired in Joe Spinks, Mario Bennes (who played earlier with the club), Chris McGuthrie and Teddy Gipson. The club also got a new main sponsor in Demon and was renamed \"Demon Astronauts\". \nIn 2004–05, the fifth national title was won, after Amsterdam beat Landstede Basketbal 4–0 in the Finals.\nIn 2005–06 and 2006–07, Amsterdam played as the \"Amsterdam Astronauts\" and ended in the 2nd and 6th places in the Eredivisie.\nIn May 2007, businessman Roel Pieper got the job of chairman of the club. MyGuide became the new main sponsor of the club. In 2008–09 and 2009–10, the club won their sixth and seventh titles, both by beating EiffelTowers Den Bosch 4–3 in the Finals. Also, captain Peter van Paassen won the league MVP award in both seasons.\nEven though Amsterdam won their 2009 title on May 31, they had to wait till June 15 to officially get their title. Amsterdam player Orien Greene had used cannabis, but because the letter to inform the club never arrived the club got to keep their title.\nTo add to the turmoil, both main sponsors of the club (MyGuide and Eclipse-Jet) went bankrupt, so the team played without a sponsor in the 2009–10 season.\nRebuilding and disappearance (2009–2011).\nThe team was renamed \"ABC Amsterdam\". The team, led by domestic players as DBL All-Stars Jessey Voorn, Dimeo van der Horst and Ramon Siljade did manage to reach the Playoffs in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons.\nThe team was dissolved on August 11, 2011, after it couldn't find a main sponsor that was willing to invest enough money to keep the club in the DBL. For the first time since the foundation of the Eredivisie, no team from Amsterdam played in the league. In the 2012–13 season, BC Apollo entered as new team from Amsterdam.\nHonours.\nDomestic competitions.\nDutch League \nDutch Cup\nEuropean competitions.\nFIBA Korać Cup\nNotable players.\nTo appear in this section a player must have either: played at least one season for the club, set a club record or won an individual award while at the club, played at least one official international match for their national team at any time or performed very successfully during period in the club or at later/previous stages of his career."

Khalid El-Amin was immediately fouled, and he made both free throws to put the Huskies up by three points. The Blue Devils, who were out of timeouts, had a final chance to tie the game and force overtime, but Langdon, one of college basketball's best three-point shooters, was unable to get off a shot in the final seconds when he got triple-teamed and fell to the floor, and UConn escaped with a 77-74 victory, giving Jim Calhoun's Huskies their first national championship.\nAftermath.\nThe victory against Duke marked the start of a dynasty for the Huskies, as they would go on to win five more national championships in 2004, 2011, 2014, 2023, and 2024. UConn is now tied with North Carolina for the third most national championships, trailing only Kentucky (8 titles) and UCLA (11 titles).\nDespite the loss to UConn, Duke would rebound and win another national championship two years later.

A host for the third edition has not been confirmed.\nThe various Europe-wide championships in the same disciplines that are held outside this quadrennial framework (e.g. annually in the cases of cycling, gymnastics, rowing and triathlon; biennially in the cases of athletics and aquatics) are unaffected by this event.\nOverview.\nEuropean Championships Management, co-founded by Paul Bristow and Marc Joerg, developed the event concept, and manages and implements the European Championships on behalf of the participating Federations.\nThe 2018 European Athletics Championships were held in Berlin, while Glasgow hosted the Aquatics, Cycling, Gymnastics, Rowing and Triathlon along with a new European Golf Team Championships. The championships were being staged under one new brand with the 'Mark of a Champion', a star-like logo.\nThe second edition saw aquatics and golf remove themselves from the programme, while canoe sprint and paracanoe, sports climbing, beach volleyball, table tennis and rowing joined the event.\nAt the end of the second edition, European Athletic Association indicated that athletics would leave the programme for 2026 and, as with aquatics in 2022, would hold its championships on the same dates but under its own branding.\nThe European Broadcasting Union is a key partner in the event, broadcasting across Europe's free to air channels via its Eurovision Network, with an estimated audience of 1.03 billion. It is also being broadcast across radio and multiple digital platforms.\nThis competition is not related to the European Games organised by the European Olympic Committees in the 'Olympic tradition'.\nFirst edition (2018).\nThe European governing bodies for athletics, aquatics, cycling, golf, gymnastics, rowing and triathlon, co-ordinated their individual continental championships as part of the first edition between 2 and 12 August 2018, hosted by the cities of Berlin (already chosen as the host for the 2018 European Athletics Championships) and Glasgow (already chosen as the host for the 2018 European Aquatics Championships, and which now also hosted the events of the other sports).\nThe initial participating continental governing bodies, and championships, are:\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the umbrella body for the continent's free-to-air channels, was the broadcast partner for the combined championships, which were expected to generate more than 2700 hours of programming. Athletics alone, expects a 20% rise in television viewing figures compared to a traditional single-sport European Athletics Championships.\nAll of Europe's major free-to-air broadcasters will televise the European Championships in 2018. The European Broadcasting Union, which holds the broadcast rights on all platforms, has confirmed coverage across the top five markets, BBC in the United Kingdom, ARD/ZDF in Germany, France Televisions in France, RAI in Italy and TVE in Spain. Other EBU members already signed up include VRT (Belgium), HRT (Croatia), DR (Denmark), YLE (Finland), RTÉ (Ireland), NOS (Netherlands), NRK (Norway), TVP (Poland), SRG SSR (Switzerland) and SVT/TV4 (Sweden). The level of coverage is also enhanced by a deal with Eurosport. In total, over 40 EBU members have signed agreements as of April 2018. Discussions are ongoing with broadcasters in the remaining territories in Europe, plus other global territories like China, Japan and USA.\nGlasgow 2018 has five Official partners (People Make Glasgow, Scottish Government, Strathmore Water, Spar &amp; Eurovision) and Berlin 2018 has six Official partners (Spar, Le Gruyère, Nike, Toyo Tires, Generali &amp; Eurovision) with another tier of Official supporters across the two host cities.

        "text": "This is a list of the top 40 Nippon Professional Baseball home run hitters. In the sport of baseball, a \"home run\" is a hit in which the batter scores by circling all the bases and reaching home plate in one play, without the benefit of a fielding error. This can be accomplished either by hitting the ball out of play while it is still in fair territory (a conventional home run), or by an inside-the-park home run. Sadaharu Oh holds the Nippon Professional Baseball home run record (as well as the world lifetime home run record) with 868. He passed Hank Aaron (who is currently second on the Major League Baseball career home run list) with 755, on September 3, 1977. The only other NPB player to have hit 600 or even more home runs is Katsuya Nomura with 657. Slugger Noboru Aota retired in 1959 as the Japanese professional baseball career leader with 265 career homers. He was surpassed in 1963 by Kazuhiro Yamauchi, the first Japanese professional baseball player to hit 300 home runs. (Yamauchi finished his career with 396 home runs.) Sadaharu Oh assumed the top spot in 1968, later becoming the first NPB hitter to surpass 600 home runs during the 1974 season. Listed are all Nippon Professional Baseball players with 300 or more home runs hit during official regular season (i.e., excluding playoffs or exhibition games). Players in bold face are active as of the 2024 Nippon Professional Baseball season (including free agents).\nList.\n\"Stats updated as of 2023 season.\""

        "title": "Chris Commons (basketball)",
        "text": "Christopher Earl Commons (born December 8, 1984) is an American professional basketball player. Brought up in Toledo, Ohio, he played high school basketball at Central Catholic High School. Commons initially competed at the collegiate level for the University of Findlay before transferring to the University of South Carolina Aiken. At USC Aiken, he played in the NCAA Division II and earned all-league honors.\nUpon his departure from college, Commons joined Al Ittihad in Bahrain. He then moved to Germany to play with BSV Wulfen. In 2010, he signed with the Brunei Barracudas in Southeast Asia. Commons returned to the US in 2011 to compete for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Steamers, only to finish the season with the Finnish club Korikobrat. For the following four years, he represented the Windsor Express of Canada, where he garnered All-Star accolades and won two championships.\nEarly life and high school.\nCommons spent his childhood in Toledo, Ohio near his grandparents, but he was mainly looked after by his mother Rena. His father worked at a charter bus company and was absent for most of the year. Chris attended the Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church three times each week with his extended family. Commons started playing basketball in fourth grade, and he supposedly tried to improve his shooting skills early on by nailing a milk crate to a tree in his yard. He also watched Chicago Bulls games on television in his bedroom.\nFor middle school, Commons went to McTigue Junior High and played basketball on the school team. At the time, he was known as having a quiet personality, while his childhood friend and teammate Norman Mars was more verbal. Commons later attended Central Catholic High School in Canton, Ohio. In high school, he joined forces with Mars on the Central Catholic Irish basketball team, and the duo became the forefront of the team. Commons had a low impact in his first two years, but he rapidly rose to stardom starting in his junior season. As a senior, he was averaging team-highs of 21.3 points and 6.8 rebounds per game for the Irish. For the first half of his final season at Central Catholic, Commons was the top high school scorer in the city of Toledo.\nCollege career.\nFindlay.\nCommons played two seasons of college basketball with the Oilers of the University of Findlay on a full-ride scholarship. At Findlay, he improved as a shooter and developed physically in order to succeed against stronger NCAA Division II competition. On November 22, 2003, he led his team with six rebounds. Commons replicated the feat on January 29, 2004 to help the Oilers defeat Grand Valley State. In 32 games as a freshman, he averaged 7.7 points, 2.5 rebounds, and a team-high 0.8 blocks per game. Commons quickly became the leader of the team during his sophomore season. He debuted by scoring a career-high 30 points along with five rebounds in a win over Urbana on November 17, 2004. Commons posted 21 points against Ferris State on December 2, helping the Oilers prevail by two points. On February 19, 2005, he added 28 points to beat Ashland.\nAt the 2005 NCAA Division II Tournament, Commons led Findlay with 29 points and nine rebounds vs. Ferris State on March 15. The Oilers' victory put them in the Elite Eight round, but they would lose in their following contest. Commons lifted Findlay to the No. 1 ranking in Division II, and he pushed his team to a school-best 30–4 record by the end of the season. He averaged 15.5 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks per game as a sophomore. Commons was also hoping to graduate early and double major in criminal justice and forensic science.\nUSC Aiken.\nIn spite of his success at Findlay, Commons was suspended indefinitely from the school's basketball program on robbery charges in August 2005. Only two weeks after his release from jail in 2007, he began receiving offers to continue his career at colleges such as Columbus State, Grand Valley State, and Northwest Missouri State. Findlay, on the other hand, was not interested in having him back. He ultimately chose to finish his collegiate career at USC Aiken, where he would represent the Pacers under head coach Vince Alexander. The Pacers' coach was impressed by the new arrival's potential, and he \"wanted to see him prove a lot of people wrong.\" Commons reflected, \"I learned a lot of lessons, I've been through a lot of tough stuff and to be where I'm at now, I'm blessed.\"\nThe junior had an immediate impact on the Pacers, debuting with a career-best 38-point effort against Mars Hill on November 17, 2007. He also added 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocks, along with seven turnovers, in the win. As of February 2021, it was tied for the sixth-best scoring performance by a player in school history. On December 1, Commons recorded 31 points and 13 rebounds vs. Armstrong Atlantic. He posted 36 points and six rebounds on January 19, 2008, against Columbus State.\nProfessional career.\nOn October 5, 2009, Commons signed his first professional contract with Al Ittihad of the Bahraini Premier League. He received praise from Vince Alexander, who said, \"Once again, as we always are for all our former players who sign professional contracts, we are excited for Chris and his family.\" Commons averaged about 35 points and 11 rebounds per game in Bahrain. However, he left the team in the following month. He returned to pro basketball on January 25, 2010, finishing the rest of the season with BSV Wulfen of the Basketball Regionalliga in Germany. He joined the team to replace Ryon Howard, who had suffered an injury earlier. He appeared in four games for BSV, averaging 24.4 points per game and shooting 57.9% from the field.\nFor the 2010–11 season, Commons signed with the Brunei Barracudas of the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL). Team manager Benny Ang had been keeping track of the player long before the deal was made. Commons would join Christopher Garnett as one of the team's two imports. In an early season loss to defending champions Philippine Patriots on October 16, 2010, he posted 17 points and 11 rebounds. On October 23, he scored a game-high 38 points against Satria Muda BritAma to lead the Barracudas to their first win of the season. He had another notable performance on November 10, when he recorded 37 points vs. the Singapore Slingers. Despite his scoring effort, the Barracudas fell, 74–81. By January 2011, after finishing with a 3–10 record, the team was eliminated from postseason contention.\nOn November 17, 2011, Commons was selected with the 11th overall pick by the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Steamers in the 2011 Premier Basketball League (PBL) draft. He said, \"I'm very excited. With all the basketball turmoil going on it's a blessing to get a chance to play basketball anywhere. Things have really taken off for me.\" He was seen by head coach John Bucci as a veteran who could lead the younger players on the roster. Commons joined teammates Vincent Sampson and Rob Robinson as one of the Steamers' top scorers. In his debut, a loss to the Rochester Razorsharks on December 31, he posted a season-high 34 points and six rebounds. On January 16, 2012, Commons recorded a double-double of 28 points and 11 rebounds vs. the Charleston Gunners. He broke the 30-point barrier for the second time on March 15, when he scored 32 points along with 12 rebounds to defeat the Lake Michigan Admirals. In a rematch the next day, Commons scored 33 points but was unable to capture the victory. At the end of the season, Commons averaged 19.3 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.9 blocks per game.\nTo start the 2012–13 season, Commons signed with Korikobrat, a Finnish club that competed in the Korisliiga. In his first game with the team, on October 3, 2012, he scored 19 points, grabbed six rebounds, and blocked three shots in a loss to Tampereen Pyrintö.\nOn August 11, 2017, Commons signed with Rotterdam Basketbal of the Dutch Basketball League (DBL). On December 24, Commons was released by Rotterdam after averaging 17 points and 7.9 rebounds per game.\nPersonal.\nIn August 2005, Commons was suspended indefinitely from the Findlay basketball team after being charged for robbery and complicity to commit robbery. Allegedly, he took part in three robberies, all of which involved a weapon. Oilers' head coach Ron Niekamp said, \"It was devastating for us to lose a player of that caliber.\" Commons was accused of the crime along with Ronnell Scott and his cousins Carlton and John Jackson. He allowed them to use his sports utility vehicle without knowing their full intentions. Despite Commons' minimal involvement, Scott and the Jacksons largely blamed him for the incident. Commons said, \"I never went in any store. I didn't mastermind it. I didn't need for nothing. I was on full scholarship. I come from a well taken care of family. I didn't ask for nothing.\" In January 2006, he began an eight-month sentence at the Correctional Reception Center near Columbus, Ohio. Commons was forced to complete 100 hours of community service, and he was ordered to four years of community control. In jail, he embraced his passion for cooking and often played basketball, scoring 69 points in one game. For one month after his release, Commons remained under house arrest."

He played college basketball with the UC Davis Aggies, and was a three-time all-conference selection in the Big West Conference. As a senior in 2014–15, he was named the Big West Player of the Year.\nHawkins is the son of National Basketball Association (NBA) player Hersey Hawkins. In high school in Arizona, he set state scoring records, and was named a \"Parade\" All-American as a senior. He began his college career with Arizona State, but transferred after one season to UC Davis. As a member of the Aggies, he twice led the Big West in scoring.\nEarly life.\nHawkins was born in Philadelphia to Jennifer and Hersey Hawkins, who was playing basketball professionally with the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA. Hawkins went to high school at Estrella Foothills High in Goodyear, Arizona, where he was a member of three state title teams.

After an unfulfilling season at Arizona State, Hawkins transferred to the University of California, Davis, whose basketball program was coached by Jim Les, a former college teammate of Hawkins' father at Bradley. Forced to sit out a year due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules, Hawkins led the Big West Conference in scoring (20.3 points per game) in his first season with UC Davis in 2012–13, when he also earned first-team all-conference honors.

He played in the Reese's College All-Star Game, earning most valuable player honors after scoring a game-high 20 points. At the end of his career, Hawkins and his father had combined to score 4,687 points in college, the second most in Division I history for a father–son combo behind only Dell and Stephen Curry (5,020).\nProfessional career.\n2015–16 season.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft, Hawkins joined the Philadelphia 76ers for the Utah Summer League, but got no playing time for the 76ers, and later joined the Sacramento Kings for the Las Vegas Summer League where he was sidelined with a right ankle injury. On August 21, 2015, he signed with the Miami Heat, but was waived on October 19 after appearing in two preseason games.\nOn November 2, 2015, Hawkins was acquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA Development League as an affiliate player of the Heat. On November 14, he made his professional debut in a 98–95 loss to the Iowa Energy, recording three points in 13 minutes off the bench.\nOn December 31, 2015, Hawkins was traded to the Idaho Stampede in exchange for the returning player rights of Shane Gibson.

        "text": "The Indian cricket team were scheduled to tour Sri Lanka in December 2015 to play Pakistan. The tour was planned to consist of three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Despite several locations being suggested to host the matches, neither side could agree on when and where to play the games and the series did not go ahead.\nBackground.\nOriginally the tour was scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates between 8 December 2015 and 9 January 2016, with the teams playing three Test matches, five ODIs and two T20Is.\nOn 24 August 2015 Zaheer Abbas, the president of cricket's governing body, said that the series might be delayed. In October 2015 Shahryar Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), said that Pakistan would consider pulling out of the 2016 World Twenty20 tournament if this series did not go ahead.\nIn November 2015 the PCB and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) were still in talks about agreeing the location of the series, with the BCCI suggesting it could be held in India, rather than the UAE. A day after the BCCI made its suggestion, the PCB stated that Pakistan could not play a series in India and that the series would only be possible if it was played in the UAE. The PCB's Shaharyar Khan said that a decision regarding the series lies with the Pakistan prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.\nOn 22 November 2015 a meeting with the BCCI and PCB took place, where the possibility of holding the series in Sri Lanka was presented as an option. This would consist of three ODI matches and two T20I matches. The BCCI confirmed that the series would take place in Sri Lanka, with other options being Bangladesh and England, the latter proposed for the Summer of 2016.\nHowever, the Indian government had not granted permission for the series to take place, stating that the final decision rests with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. In response to the delay from the Indian government, the PCB said that they would host a one-off T20 tournament that features five domestic sides if the series does not go ahead.\nAn outcome on the future of the series was scheduled to be announced on 9 December. However, despite a meeting taking place between ministers from both India and Pakistan, no decision was reached regarding the series.\nOn 19 December 2015 the BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur had all but ruled out the series from happening, with a short window before India's tour to Australia in January. He said that the decision lies with Pakistan and the PCB to make.\nAnti-Pakistan protests in Mumbai.\nOn the morning of 19 October, BCCI president Shashank Manohar and PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan were to discuss a proposed India-Pakistan series in December. Just prior the meeting a group of 50 workers from the Shiv Sena, a far-right nationalist political party, stormed into the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai, shouting anti-Pakistan slogans and demanding the cancellation of the series. They also threatened to stop Aleem Dar from officiating in the Mumbai ODI of the ongoing India-South Africa ODI series.\nAleem Dar, a member of the elite panel of ICC umpires, who had officiated in the first three ODIs of the series, and was also scheduled to umpire in the fourth and fifth ODIs in Chennai and Mumbai, was withdrawn from the ODIs in response to the above incident by the ICC. Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar, a part of the commentary team, decided to leave India before the 5th ODI at Mumbai."

        "text": "The 2015 Copa América final was the final match of the 2015 Copa América, an international football tournament organized by CONMEBOL that was played in Chile.\nThe match was held on 4 July 2015 in Santiago's Estadio Nacional, and contested by hosts Chile, and Argentina. Following a goalless draw, Chile defeated Argentina in a penalty shootout to win their first title and qualify for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia. \nA new trophy was supposed to be created for the tournament and was to be unveiled on 4 July 2015 at the final. No trophy was unveiled amidst the FIFA corruption scandal.\nBackground.\nThis edition was the seventh hosted by Chile. The match marked the third time Chile had reached a final. They had never won the competition; their last finals appearance was in 1987, when they were defeated by Uruguay. Meanwhile, Argentina reached its fifth final in Chilean territory. Their previous finals appearance was in 2007, when they were defeated by Brazil, while their last championship (including worldwide tournaments) was won in 1993.\nIncluding the editions from 1916 to 1967, when the \"Campeonato Sudamericano\" had a round-robin tournament format without a final match; it was the fifth appearance of Chile, and the twenty-seventh of Argentina, in the top two.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nBoth sides had opportunities to open the scoring, and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo made a close-range save from Sergio Agüero, who had been set up by Lionel Messi. However, soon afterwards, Argentina made the first substitution due to a hamstring injury, with Ángel Di María making way for Ezequiel Lavezzi. Chile finished the first half with three yellow cards, while Argentina had none.\nChile began the second half with attacking momentum, and the first Argentine yellow card went to Javier Mascherano for deliberate handball. With 15 minutes remaining, both teams made substitutions, with Argentina switching their center-forward from Agüero to Gonzalo Higuaín, and Chile making an alteration in midfield, replacing Jorge Valdivia with Matías Fernández. Minutes later, Arturo Vidal went down in the penalty area, but no foul was called. With nine minutes remaining of regulation time, Argentina made their final substitution, Javier Pastore was replaced by Éver Banega; soon after his entrance into the game, Banega was fouled by Charles Aránguiz, who was booked. Argentina then had their best chance of the game with only seconds remaining in regular time. Argentina staged a counterattack after Chile lost the ball. Messi dribbled past two Chilean defenders before passing the ball to Lavezzi near the penalty area, Lavezzi then passed the ball to Higuaín, who charged down the right side with a tight angle to shoot. His shot was inches wide of the inside of the post, however, and instead the ball hit the outside of the net. After regulation time, the game remained goalless.\nEarly into extra time, Chile made their second substitution, replacing Eduardo Vargas with Ángelo Henríquez. In the final minutes of extra time, Chile had a corner, which was cleared by Lucas Biglia and Higuaín. During the second period of extra time, Chile had their best chance to take the lead, after a goal throw from Claudio Bravo failed to be properly cleared away by Mascherano, leaving Alexis Sánchez to run down the pitch and shoot, only for his shot to go over the crossbar. Later on, Messi was fouled, giving a free kick to Argentina, which Gary Medel cleared three times from the Chilean penalty area to take the game into a penalty shootout.\nMatías Fernández took the first penalty, dispatching it past Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero, and Messi netted Argentina's first attempt to keep the scores level after the first round. Second was Vidal, who scored, despite Romero making contact with his shot. Higuaín then missed, with an attempt which went too high. Aránguíz scored from a powerful attempt and then Bravo saved Banega's shot. Alexis Sánchez scored the winning penalty, a Panenka-style finish.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "David Augustus Hughes III (born June 1, 1959) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Boise State Broncos and was selected in the second round of the 1981 NFL draft. He spent the first five season of his NFL career with the Seattle Seahawks (1981–1985) and the final one with the Pittsburgh Steelers. As a fullback, he was primarily a blocker, gaining just over 1,000 yards in his pro career.\nEarly years.\nThe son of David Hughes Jr. and Dorothy (Kim-Kruetter) Hughes, Hughes was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and raised in Kailua, on the windward side of Oahu. He has two sisters (Debbie and Diane) and one brother (Dean). When Hughes was eleven, his father died.\nHughes said his father's death had an impact. \"I fell away from my family,\" said Hughes. \"In junior high and high school I got involved with drugs and alcohol. I thought I was pretty cool. But inside I was very unhappy.\"\nHughes attended the Kamehameha Schools in Honolulu and graduated in 1977. He was a standout athlete at Kamehameha, receiving letters in football, basketball, and track. In football, Hughes was a member of three consecutive Oahu Prep Bowl and Interscholastic League of Honolulu championship teams. As a senior in the fall of 1976, he was named football offensive player of the year for the state of Hawaii.\nBoise State.\nHughes played college football at Boise State from 1977 to 1980, starting at fullback all four years and tallying 1,826 rushing yards (5.2 yards per carry). As a sophomore in 1978, he was named to the All Big Sky Conference first-team, and also received honorable mention on the AP Division II All-America team.\nHughes, quarterback Joe Aliotti, and halfbacks Cedric Minter and Terry Zahner were christened Boise's \"Four Horsemen,\" and the quartet played key roles as seniors on the Broncos team that won the NCAA Division I-AA title in 1980. Minter and Hughes were also chosen to play in the 1980 East–West Shrine Game. Hughes is a member of the Boise State University Athletics Hall of Fame and in 2005 was named the first-team fullback on the Boise State Bronco 35 team, which honored the top BSU football players from 1970 to 2005.\nNFL career.\nIn the 1981 NFL Draft, Hughes was picked in the second round (31st overall) by the Seattle Seahawks. He was a member of the 1983 team that made it to the NFL playoffs for the first time in franchise history. He was second on the team in rushing that season with 327 yards. In his six years in the NFL, Hughes totaled 1,041 yards rushing, 864 yards receiving, and 663 yards in kickoff returns. He has seven career touchdowns. While playing for Pittsburgh in 1986, a knee injury ended his playing career.\nAfter football.\nIn 1983, Hughes met Kalua Kaiahua from Napili and had a spiritual experience where there was an \"opening the doors of faith in God.\". After his NFL career ended, Hughes became active in religious ministry. In 1994, he and his family returned to Idaho and settled in Eagle, adjacent to Boise. There he pursued his ministry and served as running backs coach for Eagle High School, the Class A-1 (Division II) state champions in 1998.\nHughes and his \"ohana\" (family) relocated to the Seattle area in 1999 to accept a position on staff at Antioch Bible Church in suburban Redmond. He also volunteered as an assistant football coach at Eastlake High School, where he taught his players the \"highest values ... of sportsmanship, team play and doing [their] best in sports as in life.\" Hughes served as the Mission pastor for Antioch Bible Church (a non-denomination church) in Redmond for almost 14 years before stepping away to start a ministry in the inner city area of Seattle. He currently assists the football team at Rainier Beach High School, and still is in the weight room every day. His ministry, Paraclete 46, focuses on urban student athletes and their families in providing resources and guidance.\nPersonal life.\nWhile a senior at Boise State University, Hughes married Holly Ann Mahealani Haleamau on February 14, 1981. They have five children: Lahela, Kela, Keoni, Kaniela, and I`okepa."

        "text": "Buffalo Hill Golf Club is a public 27-hole parkland golf course located in Kalispell, Flathead County, Montana. The course was founded in 1918. Prior to becoming a golf course the land was owned by the affluent Conrad family† and used as a buffalo pasture. The golf course is located southwest of Glacier National Park and north of Flathead Lake.\nDave Broeder—who was appointed as PGA head professional in 1990—had worked at the club since 1974. He announced his retirement in early 2018 and was succeeded by Casey Keyser. The Championship 18 Course at Buffalo Hill was designed by noted golf course architect Robert Muir Graves.\nHistory.\nIn 1918, land was purchased where part of the Cameron 9-hole course now stands. The Cameron course is named for Dave Cameron, a former Kalispell mayor and early golf administrator in the area. Another nine holes were built with sand greens and no irrigation on the fairways. This 18-hole course continued to operate until the late 1930s when the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built the rustic log clubhouse. The WPA also improved the golf course by building a 9-hole irrigated grass course. Some holes are still in service today while others have been modified during subsequent expansions.\nIn 1964, the club made a major improvement with the construction of nine more holes, four of which are incorporated into the Championship 18 course. In 1974, members of the Kalispell Golf Association decided to expand the course to 27 holes with construction of new golf holes around and over the Stillwater River.\nThe nearly $1,000,000 expansion project, led by expansion committee chairman Otis Robbins, was financed by donations from the Buffalo Hill members, sales of debenture bonds, and matching funds from the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. An 82-acre tract of land was donated by Kalispell furniture merchant Duane Bitney and businessman Sid Torgerson for the project. The cooperative efforts and commitment to the completion of this expansion reflected the heart, dedication, and vision of the leaders of the Kalispell Golf Association of that era.\nPGA head professional George Haddow served at Buffalo Hill for 25 years. After Haddow's resignation in late 1976, Butte, Montana, native Charles \"Skip\" Koprivica was hired as the new head professional in December 1976. Kalispell native and LPGA Tour golf professional Alice Ritzman played the course in her youth before her successful career on the LPGA Tour.\nChampionship 18 Course.\nOn August 11, 1978 the legendary Arnold Palmer—accompanied by fellow PGA Tour professional Bob Dickson—was on hand to celebrate the Grand Opening of the \"Championship 18 Golf Course\". In 1967, Dickson became the first amateur golfer since 1935 to win both the U.S. Amateur and British Amateur. He turned professional and joined the PGA Tour in 1968. Mac McLendon had originally been scheduled to appear with Palmer for the dedication but could not attend due to a bout with tendonitis.\nDesigned by Robert Muir Graves—with the expert assistance of construction superintendent John Steidel—the course was referred to as a \"monument\" and rivals as one of the best golf courses in the Pacific Northwest. Since the 1990s the golf course has continued to make improvements by rebuilding tee boxes, upgrading irrigation systems, reshaping bunkers, improving sand quality and, most recently in 1999, rebuilding of four new greens on holes 12, 13, 16 and 17. In 2011, the Cameron 9-hole golf course was remodeled to accommodate a new driving range and practice facility.\nTournaments hosted.\nBuffalo Hill Golf Club has hosted many important tournaments over the years. The club is best known for the annual \"Labor Day International Classic\" tournament which is a 54-hole event first played in 1939. Dozens of players from the Canadian province of Alberta attend each year along with a large contingent of local and regional players. The first round consists of two trips around the Cameron 9-hole course, which plays to a par 33, and the second and third rounds are contested on the Championship Course.\nCourse location.\n1176 N. Main Street\nKalispell, MT 59901\nNotes.\n‡ The tournament course record is 64 by Scott Desmarais of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The non-tournament course record of 63 was posted by Logan Lindholm of Kalispell."

Before the start of the season, one player was declared academically ineligible, one was lost for the season to a knee injury, and another ended his playing career on medical advice due to post-concussion symptoms. In December, two more players were dismissed from the team after having been charged with theft. This left the Flyers with only six players who began the season on scholarship; in addition, no player on the remaining roster, whether on scholarship or a walk-on, was taller than 6'6\" (1.98 m).\nDespite these roster limitations, the Flyers finished 27–9 overall and 13–5 in A-10 play, ending in a tie for second place in the league.

Cold shooting on the night was the Flyers downfall at only 31% for the game. Returning home to UD Arena, the Flyers looked to get back on track facing a hot shooting Davidson Wildcat team. The key stretch was a 19–0 second half run in the 80–74 victory. Four Flyers had double figure scoring nights, led by Scoochie Smith's 18 points. Freshman big man, Steve McElvene, broke the Freshman single season block record with his 34th block.\nDayton looked to avenge last season's buzzer-beater tip-in loss at George Washington by welcoming the Colonials back to UD Arena.

For his efforts on the week Cooke was named Atlantic 10 player of the week.\nBack home after the New York road trip, the Flyers welcomed rival Saint Louis in a battle for the legendary/elusive/never been seen Arch-Baron Cup. The game was tied 10–10 before the Flyers went on a huge run to blow out the Billikens 73–37. Kendall Pollard led the Flyers with 18 points and 8 rebounds and Steve McElvene tied the blocked shots in a game record with 6. The five game winning streak brought the Flyers record to 17–3 (7–1, A10).\nThe next game brought a rematch with the only team to beat the Flyers in the Atlantic 10 so far, the LaSalle Explorers. The Flyers started off slow with LaSalle holding an early 10–2 lead, but the Flyers went on a big 28–13 run to close out the half 30–23.

        "text": "Frank Weston Moore (born April 22, 1957) is an American college basketball coach who is the current women's basketball head coach at NC State. A head coach at all three levels of NCAA women's college basketball since 1987, Moore has been named Coach of the Year eight times by three conferences and over 20 regular season or conference tournament championships.\nMoore grew up in Dallas and played college basketball at Johnson Bible College. He began his coaching career as a men's basketball coach at Johnson Bible in 1984. Then in 1987, Moore became head coach for a struggling women's basketball program at Maryville College and instantly turned the program into a winner, with five NCAA Division III Tournament appearances and over 130 wins in six seasons. The Women's Basketball Coaches Association awarded Moore three regional Coach of the Year honors.\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Moore was a women's basketball assistant coach at NC State under Kay Yow. Then from 1995 to 1998, Moore was head coach at Francis Marion, where he achieved an appearance in the 1998 NCAA Division II Final Four. In his first NCAA Division I head coaching position, Moore was head coach at Chattanooga from 1998 to 2013, during which he led the Mocs to 12 Southern Conference (SoCon) regular season championships and nine NCAA Division I Tournament appearances. With over 350 wins at Chattanooga, Moore has the most career wins in program history and won five Coach of the Year honors from the SoCon.\nMoore returned to NC State in 2013, this time as head coach. In his first seven seasons, Moore led NC State to four NCAA Tournament appearances and the 2020, 2021 and 2022 ACC Tournament titles. He was the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coach of the Year in women's basketball in 2017 and 2022.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Texas City, Texas, Moore grew up in Dallas. At Johnson Bible College (now Johnson University) in Knoxville, Tennessee, Moore played at point guard and graduated in 1984 with a degree in religious studies. Moore then enrolled at the University of Tennessee, where he earned a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1986 and master's in the same subject in 1987.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career (1984–1995).\nFrom 1984 to 1987, Moore was a men's basketball assistant coach at Johnson Bible College.\nAfter completing graduate school, Moore became women's basketball head coach at Maryville College in 1987. Moore inherited a Maryville team that won only a single game the previous season. He immediately turned around the program to a 15–12 record in his debut season and would have winning records in all of his six seasons as head coach, with five straight appearances in the NCAA Division III Tournament from 1989 to 1993 and three Converse/Women's Basketball Coaches Association District 5 Coach of the Year honors in 1990, 1992, and 1993. Moore's cumulative record at Maryville was 131–36.\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Moore was an assistant coach for NC State women's basketball under Kay Yow. During those two seasons, NC State went 34–24 and qualified for the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA Division I Tournament. Moore also directed Yow's basketball camp in the summer of 1994.\nFrancis Marion (1995–1998).\nIn his second head coaching job, Moore was head women's basketball coach at Francis Marion College from 1995 to 1998, during which he went 69–20. Following a 21–8 season in 1996–97, Moore was the Peach Belt Conference Coach of the Year. The 1997–98 Francis Marion team finished 30–3, advanced to the Final Four round of the 1998 NCAA Division II Tournament, and was ranked fifth in the final coaches' poll.\nChattanooga (1998–2013).\nIn 1998, Moore took his first NCAA Division I head coaching job at Chattanooga. After a 10–17 debut season, Moore led Chattanooga to the Southern Conference regular season title and Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) appearance in 1999–2000. Moore served as head coach at Chattanooga for 15 seasons and ended his tenure there with the most career wins in program history at 358.\nIn the 2003–04 season, Chattanooga set a school record for wins with a 29–3 record and had a historically best 27-game winning streak that included an NCAA tournament first round win over Rutgers.\nOn April 26, 2010, Moore accepted a job offer to be head coach at East Carolina. However, three days later, Moore reversed his decision in order to stay at Chattanooga.\nUnder Moore, Chattanooga won 12 SoCon regular season titles, including 11 straight from 2000 to 2010 and in his final season in 2013. Chattanooga also won nine SoCon Tournament titles (2001–04, 2006–08, 2010, and 2013) and appeared as an automatic qualifier to the NCAA Tournament in those years. Moore won six SoCon Coach of the Year honors in 2000, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2013. Chattanooga also had four WNIT appearances in 2000, 2005, 2009, and 2012.\nNC State (2013–present).\nOn April 5, 2013, Moore resigned from Chattanooga to become head coach at NC State, 20 years after he first was an assistant coach there. In Moore's debut season, NC State finished 25–8 and fourth in the ACC standings with an appearance in the NCAA Division I Tournament. Then in 2014–15, NC State finished 18–15 and advanced to the third round of the WNIT. The 2015–16 team finished 20–11 with no postseason tournament appearance.\nIn 2016–17, NC State improved to 23–9 and appeared in the second round of the NCAA tournament. The ACC named Moore Coach of the Year in women's basketball on March 1, 2017.\nAppearing in that round for the first time since 2007, NC State qualified for the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 in 2018 and 2019.\nIn the 2019–20 season, NC State finished 29–4 and won the ACC tournament for the program's first conference tournament title since 1991. However, due to COVID-19, the 2020 NCAA tournament was canceled.\nMoore's 2020-2021 NC State continued the success of the previous seasons success by repeating as ACC tournament champions, and earning road wins against two teams ranked No. 1 in the regular season (South Carolina and Louisville). The Wolfpack earned a top seed in the 2021 NCAA tournament, a program first.\nThrough the 2019–20 season, Moore had a 168–62 overall record including 77–37 in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) play, with five NCAA Division I Tournament appearances."

He was also a guard on the basketball team, selected All-Southern by some writers in 1922.\n1921.\nIn a 34–0 victory over Middle Tennessee State Normal, \"The Commodore\", Vanderbilt's yearbook, reported the lone plus of the passing game, stating \"Practically the only thing of note was the aerial efficiency—Kuhn to Ryan and Kuhn to McCullough.\" The Commodores upset the Texas Longhorns 20–0. On a third down, at some point near the middle of the second quarter, Texas' Ivan Robertson, with the Commodores' Tom Ryan and Tex Bradford running after him, threw a pass not near a single Longhorn; which was intercepted by Vanderbilt's captain Pink Wade. Wade returned the interception for 65 yards and the first touchdown of the game. In the effective Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) championship game, Vanderbilt tied the favored Georgia Bulldogs in the final quarter using a trick onside punt kicked by Ryan. Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked in behind Ryan, and rushed to recover the 25-yard onside kick. Smith jumped up to get the ball off the bounce among a hoard of Bulldogs, after they had let it bounce, including the outstretched arms of the Bulldogs' Hartley, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. Vanderbilt therefore tied for a conference title. Ryan was on Walter Camp's list of all players worthy of mention.\n1922.\nRyan did not return for the 1922 season, preferring to stay an adjunct of the oil industry in Tampico, Mexico.\n1923.\nThe school's last football conference title to date came in 1923. In the 3–0 loss to national champion Michigan, Ryan had a fine game, out-punting the famed Harry Kipke.\n1924.\nVanderbilt beat Georgia Tech in Atlanta for the first time since 1906 on a Hek Wakefield drop kick. The punting battle between Doug Wycoff and Ryan was one of the few noted features of the game. The first touchdown drive of the 16–0 win over Minnesota ended when Ryan broke through a hole created by Bob Rives, finishing a 63-yard march. Ryan was selected All-Southern by his teammates."

However, the tour was cancelled after protests from the anti-apartheid movement.\nIt was replaced by a Rest of the World team.\nRevised tour schedule.\nThe original tour schedule contained 28 matches. The Cricket Council, the governing body of English cricket, met at Lord's on 12 February 1970 when they decided to revise the tour programme, cutting it from 28 to 12 matches. Grounds at which the police would find it difficult to maintain order were excluded from the itinerary. The fixture list was published in that year’s Wisden Cricketers' Almanack."

        "text": "The 2015 Giro d'Italia began on 9 May, and stage 11 occurred on 20 May. The race began with a team time trial from San Lorenzo al Mare to Sanremo.\nStage 1.\nThe 2015 Giro started with a team time trial in Liguria, a feature included every year since the 2006 Giro d'Italia. The course was flat, but almost entirely along the Riviera del Flori cycle path. It concluded on the Lungomare Italo Calvino in Sanremo, finish to the Milan–San Remo race between 2008 and 2014. were believed to be the favourites, having won the Tour de Romandie team time trial a week before the race started, along with , the winners of the previous year's team time trial in Belfast who desired a win in the team time trial by including multiple time-trial specialists in their lineup.\n were the first team to start, with teams starting after every five minutes. They recorded a time of 20' 25\" but their time was only good enough for the second slowest time on the stage. Their time was shortly bettered by , who were 11 seconds faster. The first competitive time was set by . The Kazakh team set a time of 19' 39\" which was good enough to hold the lead for an hour. Some of the favourites for the stage like , and set competitive times but they could not knock Astana off the hot seat. Eventually, only two teams were able to beat Astana's time. The first team to beat their time was . They stopped the clock in 19' 26\", a time which was good enough for the stage-winning time. The only team to go closer to 's time was , who were the fastest at the checkpoint. However they faded in the second half of the course, handing the win. Simon Gerrans was first over the line, making him the first leader, although he claimed later that he would not keep it for long, and that Michael Matthews would probably take it in the sprint the next day.\nAs for the general classification contenders, Alberto Contador of was the best-placed rider as he was only 7 seconds off the lead. His advantage over Fabio Aru of was 6 seconds and his advantage over Rigoberto Urán of was 12 seconds. Richie Porte of suffered the most as he lost 20 seconds to Contador and he lost significant time to other general classification contenders.\nStage 2.\nThe first road stage was also held along the Ligurian coast. On the parcours, there were two intermediate sprints, in Savona and Varazze, along with a fourth category climb of the Pratozanino, but other than that, there were only one other ascent that ended still with more than to go. As a result, it was still expected to result in a sprint in Genoa, where two laps of a circuit were completed, to complete the day's running.\nThe day's breakaway was formed by five riders, consisting of 's Marco Frapporti, 's Łukasz Owsian, Eugert Zhupa of , Giacomo Berlato of and Bert-Jan Lindeman representing . They managed to obtain a lead over the peloton of nine minutes, however, it was then that the peloton, led by started pursuit to ensure that their riders would keep the pink jersey. En route, Frapporti took maximum points at both sprints ahead of the mountain sprint.\nOwsian soon attacked for the mountain sprint, however, Lindeman countered from his wheel and took maximum points, granting him the blue jersey. At this point, the five were about three minutes ahead of the peloton. soon worked hard to bring the field back together and the breakaway was finally concluded when Owsian, the last surviving breakaway rider, was caught with to go. Several crashes took down some sprinters and domestiques but the biggest time loss was suffered by Domenico Pozzovivo as he was caught behind the crashes, and lost 1' 09\" in the process. André Greipel was the first to sprint for the win but he was overtaken by Moreno Hofland, who in turn was overtaken by Elia Viviani of . Viviani ultimately beat Hofland to the sprint by about a wheel, granting him the red jersey. Finishing 7th on the stage as the highest placed rider, Michael Matthews took the maglia rosa although he did not pick up any time bonuses and was still tied on time with Simon Gerrans, Simon Clarke and Esteban Chaves. Matthews also took the white jersey as the best young rider.\nStage 3.\nThe first medium-mountain stage was held in the Cinque Terre area. The course was relatively short, but included two climbs - the third-category Colle Caprille and the second category Barbagelata, the summit of which came with to go. It had a long descent, which concluded ahead of the finish in Sestri Levante. There were also two intermediate sprints, in Torriglia and in Montebruno. Pre-race analysis suggested that the stage would either be won by a breakaway, or an attack on the second category climb.\nThe day's breakaway was formed by 25 riders. The best placed men in the breakaway were Simon Clarke and Esteban Chaves of as they were at the same time as maglia rosa wearer Michael Matthews before the beginning of the stage. would set a hard tempo in the peloton and the breakaway was only allowed to have a maximum lead of around 3 minutes before the peloton chipped into the lead. During the climbs in the middle of the course, several sprinters fell off the back of the peloton. During the climb of the second category Barbagelata, the breakaway was reduced to around a dozen riders before Pavel Kochetkov of took maximum points at the summit of the climb, ensuring he would take the blue jersey.\nDuring the descent, Domenico Pozzovivo crashed out of the race and he was taken to hospital. Italian television reported that Pozzovivo was moving and breathing for himself when he was taken away in the ambulance. He was bleeding from wounds to his face. As the stage wore on, Adam Hansen, on his 34th birthday, attacked out of the breakaway and he was joined by Maciej Paterski and Clarke. They caught Kochetkov with around left but the peloton caught them with around to go. In the mass sprint, Fabio Felline sprinted for the win but it was Matthews who passed him with to go to take the stage win. As a result of the time bonuses, he extended his general classification lead to 6 seconds over Clarke.\nStage 4.\nThe second of three consecutive medium mountain stages took the riders on a short and technical course. The stage featured a series of climbs - the third category Colla di Velva, the uncategorised Passo del Bracco, the third category Passo del Termine and the third category ascent of Biassa. After passing through the finish line for the first time, the riders took a lap on a circuit where they tackled the ascent of Biassa before taking on the descent and flat ride to the finish. The finish at La Spezia was last featured in 1989 when Laurent Fignon won the stage en route to winning the Giro.\nFor the second successive day, the breakaway featured a huge number of riders as 30 riders joined the break. The biggest surprise from the breakaway was Roman Kreuziger of , one of Alberto Contador's main lieutenants in the mountains. Despite Kreuziger's presence, the breakaway was allowed to establish a lead of around 10 minutes. soon dictated the pace on the ascent of Passo del Termine and their pace decimated the peloton. Several riders fell off the back of the peloton including the maglia rosa wearer Michael Matthews. 's pace was able to reduce the peloton to only around 20 riders and the breakaway's advantage continually decreased as the stage wore on.\nAs the final climb to Biassa was approaching, Davide Formolo made his move for , whose general classification hopes was dashed when Ryder Hesjedal was distanced on the climb of Passo del Termine. Giovanni Visconti and Amaël Moinard tried to follow his move but Formolo continued to increase his advantage. On the climb of Biassa itself, the first attack of the general classification contenders was made when Fabio Aru accelerated. He was followed by Contador and Richie Porte while Rigoberto Urán found himself unable to follow their pace. The trio of general classification contenders were able to catch the remnants of the breakaway while Formolo continued to stay out front. Visconti and Moinard eventually failed in their bid to catch Formolo as the chase group caught them. Formolo eventually soloed to his first professional win by 22 seconds ahead of the remaining breakaway riders plus the trio of general classification contenders. Aru tried to sprint for bonus seconds but it was Simon Clarke and Jonathan Monsalve who took the remaining time bonuses. Clarke celebrated as he crossed the finish line, unaware that Formolo already won the stage, before Visconti pointed out that Formolo was the stage winner. Clarke later clarified that his jubilation was for having continued his team's dominance at the Giro. Clarke, however, took the maglia rosa as the new leader of the general classification.\nStage 5.\nAfter four tough stages, the race headed to its first mountain finish. The stage was expected to be the first showdown between the main contenders as they battled it out for time gaps in the general classification. Before undertaking the final climb, the riders tackled the climb of Foce Carpinelli first into the stage. Following the descent, the course gradually went uphill with around left before the climb of Abetone officially started from the finish. The early segment of the climb averaged only 2.8% before the riders undertook the most difficult section of the climb which averaged 7.2%. The finishing kilometres approaching the summit eased up a bit, averaging 4.7%.\nNo riders were able to break clear until after when the day's breakaway was finally formed, consisting of 's Axel Domont, 's Serghei Țvetcov, 's Silvan Dillier, 's Sylvain Chavanel and 's Jan Polanc. The peloton let their advantage go up to around 11 minutes before led the chase. As the stage wore on, it became more likely that the breakaway could survive to the end. The breakaway continued to work together and by the time they started the climb of Abetone, they had an advantage of 5' 33\" over the peloton. Chavanel was the first to attack in the breakaway but he was chased down by his fellow breakaway companions. Țvetcov was eventually gapped by Chavanel's attack.\nChavanel tried to attack again but the strongest from the remaining breakaway riders was Polanc, who gradually built a gap. Chavanel tried to chase him but Polanc increased his advantage. From behind, Diego Rosa was the first to attack and he was chased by Ivan Basso. After both were caught, Stefano Pirazzi and Mikel Landa had a go but neither rider could build a substantial gap and both were eventually caught. At this point, maglia rosa wearer Simon Clarke was dropped. Just as the peloton rode through the most difficult section of the climb, Alberto Contador attacked and only Fabio Aru and Richie Porte could follow him. Another general classification contender, Rigoberto Urán, could not follow the trio as he would lose 28 seconds by the stage's end. Porte and Aru traded attacks but each time, the attacks would be nullified. Landa would join the elite group of riders, forming a quartet of chasers. Back at the front, Polanc gradually built his advantage before soloing to the stage win. Contador, Porte, Aru and Landa caught every remnant of the breakaway before the trio of contenders tried to sprint for bonus seconds, dropping Landa in the process. Chavanel was caught shortly before the finish but he hung on for second place, 1' 31\" back, with Aru outsprinting Contador and Porte to take the 4-second time bonus for third place. The peloton finished the stage scattered behind and as a result, Contador became the new maglia rosa wearer with Aru in second, only 2 seconds behind him and Porte in third, a further 18 seconds back.\nStage 6.\nAfter three successive tough stages, the race headed from Montecatini Terme to Castiglione della Pescaia in a day for the sprinters. The stage was mostly flat except for the middle sector where the short fourth category climb of Pomarance was found. The middle sector was undulating, featuring short climbs, before the riders tackled a long descent and a final flat stretch to the finish.\nTwo breakaways were formed at different times. The first riders to attack were 's Marek Rutkiewicz and 's Eduard-Michael Grosu, attacking after had passed before 's Marco Bandiera, 's Alessandro Malaguti and 's Alan Marangoni joined them after . had hoped the someone in the break could take Alberto Contador's pink jersey but the sprinters' teams, namely , , and , worked hard to keep the break under control. The breakaway's lead maxed at around five minutes before it started to go down to around three minutes at the final intermediate sprint. At this point, news of headwinds and side winds broke out and as a result of the winds, the breakaway's lead quickly went down and with left in the stage, all riders were together again.\nSoon, the teams of the general classification contenders, namely , and , worked at the front to keep their team leaders out of trouble. As the peloton passed the banner signalling remaining, the sprinters' teams went at the front to build their lead-out trains. In the finishing sprint, a crash took down several riders, including Contador. The crash was caused by Italy's Daniele Colli colliding with a spectator's camera lens, causing Colli to suffer a broken arm. As the chaos scattered behind, Greg Henderson perfectly led out André Greipel as Greipel took the stage win, his third at the Giro. With the win, Greipel took the red jersey to lead the points classification. With the crash happening inside the final , the general classification remained unchanged but Contador's challenge for the Giro was put in doubt after X-rays discovered that Contador dislocated his left shoulder in the crash. His injury prevented him from putting on the pink jersey during the podium presentations. Nonetheless, Contador stated that he would try to continue riding the Giro despite the injury.\nStage 7.\nAt long, the course featured the longest stage of the Giro d'Italia since 2000. The route only featured one categorised climb - the fourth category Monterotondo. Despite that, there were other uncategorised climbs during the course which made it difficult for the pure sprinters to survive for a final sprint. The stage was expected to be won by a puncheur or a rouleur.\nDespite suffering a shoulder injury, Alberto Contador was able to start the stage. The day's break was formed by four riders, consisting of 's Marco Bandiera, 's Nicola Boem, 's Pierpaolo De Negri and 's Nikolay Mihaylov. The peloton let them have an advantage of around 10 minutes with controlling the chase and protecting Contador. Due to a strong headwind, the peloton's pace averaged only around . Bandiera took maximum points at the intermediate sprint, after which he pulled out a piece of paper to wish his father a \"happy birthday\". The break's advantage eventually began to fall quickly after hit the front of the peloton.\nBandiera once again took maximum points at the second intermediate sprint but the break was caught with left. , once again, kept station at the front to protect Contador from any danger. Several sprinters fell off the back once the peloton reached the final stretch of the stage. The previous day's stage winner, André Greipel, tried to stay with the peloton but he also fell off the back. Michael Matthews sacrificed his chances for Simon Gerrans but they were not well-placed for the sprint. Eventually, it was Diego Ulissi who came to the front. No one was able to match his speed as he won his first stage since his nine-month suspension. Contador and the other general classification favourites finished safely within the peloton and as a result, Contador kept the maglia rosa.\nStage 8.\nThe stage featured the second summit finish of the race. The riders did tackle two climbs on the course - the second category Forca d'Acero and the first category Campitello Matese. The climb of Forca d'Acero was around long and topped at approximately to the finish. The ascent of Campitello Matese was long and featured an average gradient of 6.5%. The latter climb was expected to feature another showdown between the main general classification contenders. The stage also featured the first main test for Alberto Contador's left shoulder after his crash two days earlier.\nThe first kilometres of the stage featured some riders trying to break clear of the peloton but each time, the peloton would catch them. At one point during the stage, the peloton split and maglia rosa wearer, Contador, found himself in a second group at one minute behind the other main general classification contenders. However, the second group managed to bridge over the gap and Contador was even able to increase his lead over Aru in the general classification to 4 seconds after he took time bonuses in the intermediate sprint. At this point, Steven Kruijswijk of attacked and he was chased by ten riders as the peloton eased up the pace. Kruijswijk was able to build an advantage but he was chased by 's Carlos Betancur, 's Franco Pellizotti and 's Kristof Vandewalle. The peloton let the quartet build an advantage of around 9 minutes and soon, Pellizotti was dropped to the chasing group. The peloton slowly decreased their advantage with setting a very fast pace.\nOn the lower slopes of the climb, Betancur tried to go solo but Kruijswijk responded with a counter-attack that dropped Betancur. From behind in the chasing group, Sébastien Reichenbach and Beñat Intxausti attacked to catch Kruijswijk. They passed Kruijswijk with around to go. From behind in the peloton, Fabio Aru attacked. At first, only his teammate, Mikel Landa was able to follow him but Contador, Richie Porte, Rigoberto Urán and others were able to chase them. Landa eventually went in pursuit of the stage win and after some time, Damiano Cunego attacked as well. Aru and Porte tried to throw in more attacks but Contador and Uran would be able to follow them. Up front, Reichenbach seemed to put Intxausti in difficulty when Intxausti attacked for the win. He would not be caught as he took another Giro stage win. Landa went across the line 20 seconds behind in second while Reichenbach finished in third place, 11 seconds further back. The four main general classification favourites, along with Dario Cataldo, finished together as Contador stayed in pink.\nStage 9.\nAfter a hard day in the mountains, the riders faced around 4,000 metres of vertical climbing during the stage. The route featured 3 climbs - the second category Monte Terminio, the first category Colle Molella and the second category Passo Serra. The first ascent to Monte Terminio was expected to possibly take out the non-climbers while the crucial portion of the stage was expected to be the ascent of Passo Serra, which topped out with around to the finish.\nThe whole group of riders stayed together until the mark when 11 riders broke clear to form the day's breakaway. In terms of the general classification, the best-placed men in the breakaway were Amaël Moinard, who was at 4' 45\" back in the general classification, and Ryder Hesjedal, who was at 6' 49\" back of the pink jersey of Alberto Contador. The peloton allowed the gap to reach 5' 53\" at the top of the climb of Monte Terminio, at which point Moinard was the virtual maglia rosa. On the descent, Sérgio Paulinho attacked from the peloton but he was unable to keep his lead and soon, he dropped back to the peloton. Up front, Simon Geschke took the first two KOM sprints to take the blue jersey and on the descent of Colle Molella, Dario Cataldo of attacked from the peloton but brought him back. Soon, Tom-Jelte Slagter attacked the lead group and he was able to build a gap, taking the second intermediate sprint in the process.\nOn the descent, a motorcycle crashed on a sharp curve, causing the peloton to slow down in the process. With to go, the advantage of Slagter over the peloton was increased to nearly 6 minutes. In the chasing group, Paolo Tiralongo and Jesús Herrada attacked but they were brought back. Kenny Elissonde was next to attack and he was chased by Tiralongo but they were brought back as well. Tiralongo attacked again on the ascent of Passo Serra and this time, he was able to pull away. Back in the peloton, picked up the pace to reduce Slagter's advantage. On the climb of Passo Serra, Fabio Aru attacked and he was quickly chased down by Contador, Richie Porte and Mikel Landa. Rigoberto Urán struggled once again as he was unable to follow the attacks. Back at the front, with left, Tiralongo caught Slagter and after a while, Slagter was dropped and Tiralongo was soon on his own. From the remnants of the break, Steven Kruijswijk attacked in pursuit of Tiralongo but Tiralongo stayed out front, winning the stage solo. Kruijswijk was 21 seconds behind when he crossed the finish line in second and the remnants of the break finished 2 to 6 seconds further back. From the group of the maglia rosa, the four riders worked together to distance Urán further. As the elite group of favourites closed in on the finish, Aru sprinted to take some seconds and he was able to gain one second on Contador and Porte. Urán finished 46 seconds behind Contador and as a result, he fell to 2' 10\" behind Contador in the general classification. Contador, meanwhile, saw his lead drop to 3 seconds over Aru as Contador stayed in pink ahead of the first rest day.\nStage 10.\nThe second week of the Giro started with an entirely flat stage that was expected to end in a bunch sprint. The riders were taken across the Adriatica coastal road and located in the middle of the stage was the fourth category climb of Monte di Bartolo which was long with an average gradient of 3.5%. From there on, the stage was entirely flat until the finish in Forlì. The last time Forlì hosted a Giro stage finish was in 2006 when Robbie McEwen won the sixth stage in a bunch sprint.\nThe day's breakaway was formed by an all-Italian group, consisting of 's Nicola Boem, 's Alessandro Malaguti, 's Matteo Busato, 's Alan Marangoni and 's Oscar Gatto. The breakaway was able to establish a lead of around 5 minutes before the sprinters' teams began to chip into the lead. Despite the sprinters' teams' desire to catch the break, the five-man breakaway was not ready to give up as their gap hovered at around 2 to 3 minutes during the flat ride to the finish. Noticing that the peloton was not moving quick enough, and sent riders to attack but the break's lead remained relatively healthy.\nBack at the front, the five continued to work together but with around remaining, Gatto suffered a mechanical, causing him to drop back to the peloton. With around to go, the gap to the breakaway was a minute but with the breakaway helped by a tailwind, it seemed more and more likely that the breakaway would survive. As the break closed in on the finish line, Marangoni attacked for the stage win but he would be caught close to the finish. Eventually, it was Boem who outsprinted Busato for the stage win. With the stage win, Boem took the red jersey as leader of the points classification. Giacomo Nizzolo led the peloton across the line 18 seconds later as Alberto Contador kept the maglia rosa. However, one rider notably absent from the group was Richie Porte, as he suffered a flat tyre with around to go. Despite 's efforts to bridge the gap to the peloton, Porte lost 47 seconds on the day to drop him to fourth place in the general classification. Later in the day, he was given a two-minute penalty for an illegal wheel change – he had received a wheel from fellow Australian, 's Simon Clarke. As a result, Porte dropped out of the top 10 and he was now 3' 09\" behind Contador in the general classification.\nStage 11.\nAfter an almost entirely flat stage, the riders tackled the hills for a lumpy ride. The route contained three categorised climbs - the third category Passo Del Trebio, the third category Valico Del Prugno and the fourth category Tre Monti, which was passed four times during the stage. However, the route also contained several uncategorised climbs. After passing the Valico Del Prugno, the riders entered the Imola Circuit. The finishing circuit of the stage was long and the riders tackled it three times. Each circuit contained the climb of Tre Monti but only the third passing of the climb was categorised.\nNo rider was able to break away until after the first intermediate sprint, from the start. Giacomo Nizzolo won the intermediate sprint and shortly after the intermediate sprint, 10 riders slowly made their way into the break. General classification-wise, the best-placed man in the breakaway was Ryder Hesjedal, who was 6' 16\" behind maglia rosa wearer Alberto Contador. The break was only allowed to build a gap of 3' 48\" before the peloton started the chase. Along the way, Luca Paolini and Carlos Betancur fell off their bikes but they did not suffer serious injuries and Betancur made it back into the break. With to go and as the riders entered the finishing circuit, the break's lead was down to 57 seconds but the break began to build their lead again. With around to go, Stefan Küng put in a dig from the peloton and though he tried to bridge the gap to the break, he was caught by the peloton shortly afterwards.\nBack up front, Ilnur Zakarin attacked with to go as the break was closing in on the categorised climb of Tre Monti. He was able to continually increase his gap on the six remaining breakaway riders and he slowly built a gap of around 1 minute on his chasers. As the peloton continued to chase the break, Rigoberto Urán suffered a crash and though he was gapped by around 30 seconds, he was able to make it back to the peloton. Then, as the peloton closed in on the summit of the final ascent of Tre Monti, Contador surprised everyone with an attack. Fabio Aru tried to respond to his attack but Contador was able to build a short gap before being brought back shortly. On the final run-in, Maciej Paterski and Philippe Gilbert attacked out of the peloton but the duo were not able to catch the break. Meanwhile, Zakarin continued to have a steady advantage over his chasers as he eventually soloed across the finish line, 53 seconds ahead of his fellow breakaway riders. Paterski and Gilbert finished 58 seconds behind Zakarin while the peloton crossed the line 1' 02\" behind. All of the main general classification riders finished safely within the peloton as Contador stayed in pink heading into the second half of the race."

        "text": "The 2015 Giro d'Italia was the first of cycling's Grand Tours to take place in the 2015 road cycling season. It was the 98th edition of the Giro d'Italia. The race started on 9 May in San Lorenzo al Mare and ended on 31 May in Milan. Although it took place principally in Italy, the route also led the riders into Switzerland.\nThe 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race. In October 2014, five UCI Professional Continental teams were awarded wildcard places in the race by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro, to complete the 22-team peloton. As there were nine men in each team, the initial startlist consisted of 198 riders. However, as 's George Bennett was forced to withdraw before the race start due to a blood test that revealed a low level of cortisol, only 197 riders started the first stage. These came from 36 countries; more than a quarter of the peloton (59 riders) were Italian, while no other nation had more than 15 riders participating in the race.\nThe final stage in Milan was completed by 163 riders, with 34 failing to finish the race. The race was won by Alberto Contador (riding for the team). Contador wore the general classification leader's pink jersey for the first time on stage 5, the race's first summit finish. He maintained the lead for several days, despite injuring his shoulder in a crash on stage 6. Contador lost the lead to Fabio Aru () on stage 13 after being held up in another crash, but regained it the following day, when he beat his rivals by several minutes in the race's only individual time trial. Despite coming under pressure from Aru and his teammate Mikel Landa in the final week of racing, Contador preserved his lead to the end of the Giro. Aru finished second, nearly two minutes behind Contador, and won the young rider classification; Landa completed the podium, more than a minute behind Aru. The points classification was won by Giacomo Nizzolo (), while the mountains classification was won by Giovanni Visconti (). Astana won both team classifications.\nTeams.\nAll 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to attend the race.

The United States scored 2 quick goals midway through of the game, switching the lead to the Americans, but the Swiss' weren't done until Jake Gardiner scored the third goal ten minutes before the end of the game which put the United States in the semifinals.\nCanada vs Belarus.\nThe game was nearly wrapped up after the first period, in which Canada scored four goals, including one after just 27 seconds by Brent Burns. The Canadians were in full control and never let up and ended up winning convincingly 9–0 while putting up 50 shots.\nSweden vs Russia.\nAfter around 20 minutes the game looked already decided in favour of Russia, but the Swedish team fought back and tied it up with five minutes to go. Only 26 seconds after the equalizer Evgeni Malkin scored the go-ahead goal for the Russians who advanced after scoring an empty netter late in the game.\nFinland vs Czech Republic.\nThe last quarterfinal of the day was the closest one as Finland and the Czech Republic matched up.\nThe teams went toe to toe until it was 3–3 with 15 minutes to go.

        "text": "The 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup was the second edition of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, an annual pan-European rugby union competition for professional clubs. It is also the 20th season of the Challenge Cup competition in all forms, following on from the now defunct European Challenge Cup. Due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup taking place during September and October 2015, the competition began slightly later than usual, with the first round of the group stage, on the weekend of 12/13/14/15 November 2015, and ended with the final on 13 May 2016 in Lyon.\nGloucester were the 2014 1–5 champions, having beaten Edinburgh 19–13 in the final.\nMontpellier won the cup, defeating Harlequins in the final 26–19. \nTeams.\n20 teams qualified for the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup; a total of 18 qualified from across the Premiership, Pro12 and Top 14, as a direct result of their domestic league performance, with two coming through a play-off. The distribution of teams was:\nAs of 24 May 2015, the following clubs qualified for the Challenge Cup:\nChampions Cup play-off.\nThe following teams took part in play-off matches to decide the final team in the Champions Cup. The play-off was held between Premiership side Gloucester, as Challenge Cup winners, and teams from the Pro12 and Top 14.\nThe play-off was a two-match series, with the winner of the first match progressing to the second, and the winner of that second match qualifying for the Champions Cup. The two losing sides both joined the Challenge Cup.\nQualifying Competition.\nIn December 2014, EPCR announced an expanded format for the qualifying competition.\nSix teams were to compete in two pools of three. Each team played the other once, either home or away. The winner of each pool then played a two-legged final against last year's qualifying sides, and the winners, on aggregate, took the two remaining places in the Challenge Cup.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams were seeded and split into four tiers; seeding was based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team was seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower tier. So, Pau – who were Pro D2 champions – will be seeded above Agen – who qualified through the Pro D2 play-off.\nTeams were taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw was used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1; the remaining team went into Tier 2. This allocation indirectly determined which fourth-seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others entered Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Qualifying Competition, a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro12, Rugby Europe 1 and Rugby Europe 2 were automatically included in Tier 4, despite officially being ranked 1/2 from \"that competition\".\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe draw for the Challenge Cup took place on 17 June 2015 in Neuchatel, Switzerland.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16 draw\"&gt;European Rugby Pool Draws for 2015/16 season - EPCRugby.com&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe following restrictions applied to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 17 June 2015.\nTeams will play each other twice, both at home and away, in the group stage, that will begin on weekend of 12/13/14/15 November 2015, and continued through to 21/22/23/24 January 2016, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams will be awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nThe eight qualifiers were ranked according to performance in the pool stages, and competed in the quarter-finals, which were held on the weekend of 8/9/10 April 2016. The four top seeds hosted the quarter-finals against the lower seeds, in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 22/23/24 April 2016. In lieu of the draw that was used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that home advantage would be awarded to a side based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\".\nHome advantage was awarded as follows:\nThe winners of the semi-finals would contest the final, at Parc Olympique Lyonnais (called \"Grand Stade de Lyon\" by EPCR), on 13 May 2016."

        "text": "The 2015–16 European Rugby Champions Cup was the second European Rugby Champions Cup championship (21st overall), the annual rugby union club competition for teams from the top six nations in European rugby. The European Rugby Champions Cup replaced the Heineken Cup, which was Europe's top-tier competition for rugby clubs for the first nineteen years of professional European rugby union.\nAs a result of the 2015 Rugby World Cup being held in England, the tournament started slightly later than in previous seasons, with the opening round taking place on the weekend of 13/14/15 November 2015. The tournament was won for the first time by Saracens who beat Racing 92 in the final on the 14 May 2016, at Parc Olympique Lyonnais (called \"Grand Stade de Lyon\" by competition organiser European Professional Club Rugby) in the Lyon suburb of Décines. \nTeams.\n20 clubs, from the three major European domestic leagues, competed in the Champions Cup. Nineteen clubs qualified directly as a result of their domestic league performance, with the final team coming from a play-off.\nThe distribution of teams was as follows:\n20th team play-off.\nThe following teams took part in play-off matches to decide the final team in the Champions Cup. The play-off was held between Premiership side Gloucester, as Challenge Cup winners, and teams from the Pro12 and Top 14. The losers of this play-off joined the Challenge Cup.\nThe play-off was a two-match series, with the winner of the first match, Gloucester, progressing to the second, and the winner of that second match, Bordeaux Bègles, qualifying for the Champions Cup.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captains and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nIn each Champions Cup season, the 20 competing teams are seeded and split into four tiers, each containing 5 teams.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, clubs are ranked based on their domestic league performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships, so a losing quarter-finalist in the Top 14 would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season. This represented a change for the English Premiership, which seeded teams for the 2014–15 Champions Cup without reference to their play-off performance, meaning Northampton Saints, who came top in the English Premiership, were seeded third - as the highest ranked losing semi-finalist. As a knock-on from this, Leicester Tigers, which came third in the league, dropped to fourth.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top seed clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second seed clubs to Tier 1, the remaining side being put into Tier 2. The draw also determines which fourth seed enters Tier 2, the place being given to the fourth seed from the league of the second seed placed in Tier 2. The other two sides fall into Tier 3.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16 draw\"&gt;European Rugby Pool Draws for 2015/16 season - EPCRugby.com&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe tiers are shown below. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe pool draw took place 17 June, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.\nThe following restrictions applied to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 17 June 2015.\nTeams played each other twice, both at home and away, in the pool stage, that began on the weekend of 13/14/15 November 2015, and continued through to 22/23/24 January 2016, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams were awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers were used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nFormat.\nThe four top teams hosted the quarter-finals against the four lower teams in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format according to their ranking after the pool stages. The quarter-finals were played on the weekend of 8/9/10 April 2016.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 23/24 April 2016. In lieu of the draw that previously determined the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\". Semi-final matches must be played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.\nHome country advantage was awarded as follows:\nThe winners of the semi-finals contested the final, at Grand Stade de Lyon, on 14 May 2016."

        "title": "Euclid Golf Allotment",
        "text": "The Euclid Golf Allotment, also known as the Euclid Golf Historic District, is a historic district located in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, in the United States. Roughly bounded by Cedar Road, Coventry Road, West St. James Parkway, and Ardleigh Drive, the site contains primarily residential homes built between 1913 and 1929. The historic district is built on land formerly owned by John D. Rockefeller and at one time leased to the Euclid Golf Club for its back nine holes, and it takes its name from this historic factoid. The Euclid Golf Allotment is a largely undisturbed example of an early 20th century planned community containing American Craftsman, Colonial Revival, French Renaissance Revival, Italian Renaissance Revival, Prairie School, Shingle Style, and Tudor Revival architecture.\nThe Euclid Golf Allotment was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The Euclid Golf Allotment includes the western half of the Fairmount Boulevard District, another national historic district established in 1976.\nPre-development.\nFounding Forest Hill.\nThe modern city of Cleveland Heights is built atop a geological structure known as the Portage Escarpment, a geological feature some wide that connects the Appalachian Plateau in the east to the Erie Plain in the west. Early residents of Cleveland settled along The Flats, a low-lying plain on either side of the Cuyahoga River bounded by steep slopes. Although farms initially occupied the Erie Plain above The Flats on both sides of the river, by the American Civil War middle- and upper class homes dominated these areas. Through the middle and late 1800s, a thriving business district grew on the east side of the Cuyahoga around Public Square (conceived in 1796 as the center of the town) and later Clinton Square (built in 1835). The city continued rapidly expanding eastward through the 1800s. As Cleveland became an industrial powerhouse in the late 1800s, it developed an extremely wealthy upper class. Euclid Avenue became the preferred address for more than 300 of the wealthiest families in the United States.\nEuclid Avenue reached its zenith in the 1890s, but began a three-decade rapid decline thereafter as extensive retail development drove the upper class eastward. The early pressures placed on Euclid Avenue-dwellers led to the creation of the Forest Hill estate. In 1873, wealthy Clevelander John D. Rockefeller purchased east of his home at 424 Euclid Avenue. In June 1874, Rockefeller sold of this land to investors who wished to build a sanatorium on the site. A hotel was built atop the highest hill on this land, and Rockefeller and fellow Standard Oil investor Stephen V. Harkness founded a commuter rail line, the Lake View and Collamer Railroad, to serve the sanatorium. But the hospital never opened, and the sanatorium venture failed. Rockefeller purchased the land back in 1877 transformed the hotel into his summer home, and named the estate Forest Hill. Much of the estate, however, was managed as timber farm.\nFounding of Euclid Heights and the Euclid Club.\nThe development of electric streetcars made the development of suburbs far outside Cleveland's city limits practical for the first time in the 1890s. In 1890, railroad baron Patrick Calhoun purchased atop nearby Cedar Hill, and in 1893 established the planned community of Euclid Heights. It was common at the time for deed restrictions governing type of construction, land use, occupancy, and more to be used when zoning laws and regulations did not exist, and Calhoun's Euclid Heights prohibited retail within the development to prevent Euclid Heights from becoming another Euclid Avenue. (Depreciation in residential home values was quite common at the time, and it was not unrealistic for a family to fear loss of their home due to retail development.)\nTo further enhance the value of the development, Calhoun organized the Euclid Golf Club. With a course designed by British professional golfer W.H. \"Bertie\" Way, the club opened in 1901. The clubhouse was located on Norfolk Road, between Derbyshire and Cedar roads. The first, second, and ninth greens were located due west of the clubhouse, in the area framed by Euclid Heights Road and Cedar Road. The fourth through eighth greens ran largely north and south in the area framed by Cedar Road, Harcourt Drive, North Park Boulevard, and Bellfield Avenue. The back nine holes were in the area framed by Cedar Road, Grandview Avenue, North Park Boulevard, and Demington Drive. The club didn't own the land beneath the back nine, however. This was part of Rockefeller's Forest Hill estate. Calhoun asked Rockefeller, an avid golfer, to lease the necessary area to the club. Rockefeller agreed to do so, and required no lease payment—provided no golf was played on Sunday.\nEncroachment of Cedar Heights and Shaker Heights.\nThe Euclid Club was hindered by another development, Cedar Heights. Concurrent with the development of Euclid Heights, William and Edmund Walton, Jr. purchased a pasture adjacent to the western boundary of Forest Hill. They built two roads, Grandview Avenue and Bellfield Avenue. They began developing the lots on the east side of Grandview Avenue, the west side of Bellfield Avenue, and between Grandview and Bellfield Avenues, and constructed middle-class homes similar to their previous development in Little Italy. Cedar Heights was marketed only sparingly and developed slowly. But the development sat squarely and inconveniently between the front nine and back nine of the Euclid Club.\nThe creation of the Shaker Heights development largely doomed the golf club. A community of Shakers founded a commune and farm in the area in 1822, but their numbers had dwindled to just 27 by 1888. In a series of transactions, the Shakers sold the land to a group of Cleveland investors in 1891 who called themselves the Shaker Heights Land Company. The company then donated of land along Doan Brook, Horseshoe Lake (aka Upper Shaker Lake), and Lower Shaker Lake in December 1895 to the city of Cleveland as a park, with the proviso that the city build a road along the park (which effectively connected the Shaker Heights development to Cleveland). Rockefeller donated another as well, to connect this park to Lake Erie (creating Rockefeller Park). Sales remained meager, however, and the company sold its land holdings in 1896 to a syndicate of Buffalo investors led by William Henry Gratwick, Sr. (owner of the Gratwick Steamship Company) and John J. Albright (president of the Ontario Power Company). Once more, sales were minimal. Eight years later, the land was overgrown and its value was 25 percent below its $316,000 ($ in dollars) purchase price. In 1904, the Van Sweringen brothers, Oris Paxton and Mantis James, took over as land agents for the company, formed a syndicate of local investors, and began purchasing lots for development from the Shaker Heights Land Company. As with Calhoun's Euclid Heights, the Van Sweringens used deed restrictions to significantly constrain development to residential housing, and to require that all housing be of the highest quality in terms of design, siting, and construction.\nThe development of Shaker Heights adjoined the Rockefeller estate. Rockefeller was intrigued by the possibility of developing Forest Hill, and allowed the Van Sweringens to produce a brochure showing how a possible development of the eastern half of his \"back nine\" could be developed into yet another planned community. But nothing came of this venture. In 1906, Rockefeller agreed to allow the Van Sweringens to build a streetcar line across the Forest Hills estate. The line followed Cedar Road, and then traveled in the center of Fairmount Boulevard to Lee Road. Although a part of Fairmount Boulevard had existed since 1858, the portion from Cedar Road southeast to Lee Road was only developed at this time—cutting right across the Euclid Club's back nine.\nClosure of the Euclid Club.\nA significant number of Euclid Club members quit in 1909 and founded the Mayfield Country Club about to the east in Lyndhurst, Ohio. The Euclid Club discontinued its operations in 1912, The rest of the members left in 1913 to form the Shaker Heights Country Club, which opened in 1915. The Euclid Club briefly reopened the links in 1915, but ceased operations again the same year.\nBuilding the Euclid Golf Allotment.\nIn 1913, Barton R. Deming convinced John D. Rockefeller to enter into a purchase agreement for the formerly leased to the Euclid Club. The Canadian-born Deming and several of his brothers had moved to Cleveland in 1893. After working for other companies for several years, he and his brothers formed Deming Brothers, a real estate development company, in 1903 and developed several high-quality neighborhoods in East Cleveland. Deming's brother, Grant, owned several other real estate development firms, which had done business with Rockefeller in developing other parts of the Forest Hill estate. Through this work, Barton Deming came to know John D. Rockefeller.\nDeming founded the B.R. Deming Company to develop the Euclid Golf Allotment. Under the agreement struck by Deming and Rockefeller, Deming could plat or make improvements to the property only with the approval of Abeyton Realty Company, a firm founded by Rockefeller in 1909 to oversee his real estate ventures. The Euclid Golf lots were to be smaller than those in Euclid Heights, for Clarence C. Terrill, manager of Abeyton Realty, felt that the overly large lot size had inhibited Calhoun's sales. While Rockefeller bankrolled the improvements, Deming had control over sales.\nInitially, the Euclid Golf development ran into financial trouble. Lot prices fell due to competition from neighboring developments. The situation worsened when Euclid Heights developer Patrick Calhoun declared bankruptcy in 1916, and his vast Euclid Heights holdings were sold at a sheriff's sale at rock-bottom prices. Deming was forced to renegotiate his agreement with Rockefeller in 1915. In order to retain his position as the sole sales agent for Euclid Golf until July 31, 1916, Deming was forced to invest $89,747 ($ in dollars) of his own money into the development. In return, Abeyton Realty invested $320,000 ($ in dollars) in laying drinking water, electrical power, natural gas, and sewer lines and building new paved roads, complete with gutters and curbs. The new agreement also required Deming to sell lots at a minimum price and no less. Once Deming made his initial investment payment, he was permitted to purchase the rest of the property for $430,000 ($ in dollars).\nSales were strong thereafter, and on October 3, 1919, Deming paid $463,158.40 ($ in dollars) for the remainder of the Euclid Golf Allotment.\nLayout and architectural principles.\nDeming platted the Euclid Golf Allotment according to the principles of the \"garden city movement\", then a popular design strategy for wealthy suburbs. He retained as much of the natural beauty of the area as possible, and imitated other developers freely when their practices proved successful. For example, despite its past use as a golf course, the Euclid Golf Allotment was heavily wooded with mature deciduous trees. Deming required that builders retain as many of these as possible during home construction, so that the value of the land would be as high as possible. (Many of these trees still exist in the 2000s.) Deming also decided to dig Fairmount Boulevard on either side of the Cleveland Railway line which already existed on the property. A wide roadway was created on both sides of the railway line, and Deming's engineers mimicked the design of Fairmount Boulevard in Shaker Heights (laid out by the F. A. Pease Engineering Company).\nTo meet the requirements of the amended agreement with Rockefeller, Deming first had to lay out streets (which would then allow him to plat the development). These streets all gently curved, both because this met the design principles of the \"garden city\" movement but also because it allowed streets to conform to the sloping, ravine-ridden geography of the site. All the streets also connected easily and naturally to those of surrounding developments.\nSeven deed restrictions significantly limited the type and design of structures which could be erected in the Euclid Golf Allotment. Six restrictions were initially placed on construction. The first limited structures to private residential homes, specified a minimum expenditure for construction, established setback rules, and required the approval of the B.R. Deming Company before construction could begin. The goal of the restriction was to assist the builder in achieving the highest possible quality, rather than to limit him. The second restriction established minimum expenditure levels and setback rules for garages and outbuildings, and prohibited outhouses. The third limited fence height to , and established setback rules for fences. The fourth restriction barred a wide range of uses for structures, including apartments, boarding houses, taverns, and a wide range of public entertainment venues (such as dance halls and movie theaters). The fifth prohibited occupants from manufacturing or selling alcohol on the premises. The sixth deed restriction regulated the placement and size of advertising signs or similar devices. A seventh restriction, added to plots sold later, required that landscaping adhere to standards set by the B.R. Deming Company. All deed restrictions expired on May 1, 1950.\nHome construction.\nTo entice buyers, and to demonstrate how architectural creativity was not stifled by the deed restrictions, Deming hired the architectural firm of Howell &amp; Thomas to design several model homes for the development. Nearly all the model homes were built before 1920, and 12 of the 45 structures built on Fairmount Boulevard were model houses designed by Howell &amp; Thomas. The very first model house was Deming's own home, constructed on a narrow, curving, steep parcel of land at 2645 Fairmount Boulevard. The $6,000 home ($ in dollars) was designed to act as a gateway to the development, impressing visitors with its high quality and stylishness as they entered the Euclid Golf Allotment. Construction on the Deming house began on started May 4, 1914, and it was largely complete by the end of the year.\nSt. James Parkway was the first street Deming platted. Eighteen of the 22 homes built in Euclid Golf Allotment in the 1910s were constructed on North St. James. West St. James Parkway was the next to be developed. Deming was frustrated by the existence of Roxboro Elementary School and Roxboro Junior High School on the south side of the western half of West St. James Parkway, and by several low-quality duplexes on the south side of the eastern half of West St. James. To protect the Euclid Golf Allotment, Deming contracted with Howell &amp; Thomas to design 14 cottages for construction on the north side of West St. James to screen these low-quality homes from the rest of the development. These were built in the 1910s, with four more in the 1920s. Ten of the 18 houses were in the Colonial Revival style. Deming even purchased three of the remaining lots on the south side of West St. James and built high-quality cottages (2600, 2594, and 2580-2582 West St. James Parkway) to provide an additional screen for the Euclid Golf Development.\nNon-residential construction.\nAlthough nearly all the buildings constructed in the Euclid Golf Allotment were private, single-family homes, two structures were not. The first of these was the Heights Medical Building at 2460 Fairmount Boulevard. By the mid-1920s, Deming had turned his attention to the intersection of Cedar Road and Fairmount Boulevard. He had hoped to build apartment buildings east of the intersection, whose tall forms would come even with the higher part of the escarpment on which Euclid Golf Allotment was built. But a number of two- and three-story businesses had been built there by this time. The Heights Medical Building (now restaurants, retail, and offices) was a compromise structure. Designed by the firm of Steffens &amp; Steffens and finished in 1926, the Heights Medical Building was more architecturally similar to structures in Euclid Golf Allotment, but its usage was more similar to that of the lower-quality business structures in Cedar Heights and Euclid Heights nearby.\nThe other major non-residential structure in the Euclid Golf Allotment was St. Paul's Episcopal Church. St. Paul's had been the church of choice of the old Euclid Avenue aristocracy, but the decline of the avenue induced the church to move to Euclid Golf Allotment (where many of its parishioners had taken up residence). The church purchased several lots at the intersection of Coventry Road and Fairmount Boulevard (2747 Fairmount Blvd.), and hired architect J. Byers Hayes of the noted Cleveland architectural firm of Walker and Weeks to design the structure. Construction began on the parish hall in 1927, and services were first held there in April 1928. The bell tower was finished in 1929. The Great Depression halted additional construction for a decade. Construction began on the sanctuary in 1941, but shortages of construction materials during World War II forced work to halt for several years. Hayes revised his plans for the sanctuary in 1947 to reduce its cost, and construction began again in 1949. The sanctuary was finished in 1951.\nAbout the historic district.\nThe Euclid Golf Allotment was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.\nThe historic district contains , all of which are residential except for St. Paul's Episcopal Church (intersection of Coventry Road and Fairmount Blvd.) and Heights Medical Building (intersection of Fairmount Blvd. and Cedar Road). A portion of the Fairmount Boulevard Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, is contained within the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District.\nThe Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District continues to be laid out in accordance with \"garden city\" principles. The main road running through historic district if Fairmount Boulevard. Parcels on Fairmount Boulevard typically are wide and deep. Secondary roads running through the historic district include Ardleigh Drive, Chatfield Drive, Delamere Drive, Demington Drive, North St. James Parkway, Roxboro Road, Scarborough Road, Tudor Drive, West St. James Parkway, and Woodmere Drive.\nThere are 432 structures in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District. Fifty-four of these structures are in the Fairmount Boulevard Historic District, and 48 of these 54 are historic. Of the 378 remaining structures, 363 are historic. These include 229 residences, one commercial building, and 133 outbuildings (primarily garages). All of the residences are single-family homes, except for a single duplex and two cottages. Most of the homes in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District were designed by leading Cleveland-area architects, including Charles Sumner Schneider, Maxwell Norcross, Mead &amp; Hamilton, Howell &amp; Thomas, and Walker &amp; Weeks.\nAlthough deed restrictions regulated many aspects of construction and siting, they did not restrict the style of architecture in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District. Homes were designed in an array of architectural styles, and most homes were designed with elements from several styles. Generally speaking, homes built from 1913 to 1919 are more eclectic and rely on Native American architectural styles, while those built after 1919 tend to draw on more European architectural traditions and tend to be more accurate revival designs. Homes in the Colonial Revival architectural style are the most common in the historic district, representing about half of all structures. Colonial Revival homes built in the 1910s tend to include elements of the Arts &amp; Crafts, Prairie, and Queen Anne architectural styles. Colonial Revival homes built in the 1920s tend to be more purist in style. There are 75 homes in the Tudor Revival architectural style, representing 26.4 percent of all structures in the historic district. Three distinct subgenres of the Tudor Revival style—Early English, Jacobean, and Cottage—are represented in the allotment.\nOne-hundred-and-thirty-three (47.5 percent) of the homes in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District were built between 1913 and 1919. One-hundred-and-thirty-four homes (47.5 percent) were built between 1920 and 1929. Four homes (1.4 percent) were built in the 1930s, and 11 homes (3.9 percent) were constructed after 1950.\nMost utility lines run in the rear of the houses. Sidewalks are wider than usual, and original sidewalks (made of slate paving) are common. Wide road verges exist between the sidewalk and roadway. Most of the trees in the historic district existed when the development was constructed in the 1910s and 1920s.\nThe Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District retained much of its original character as of 2002. The facades of few homes had been significantly altered, although about two-thirds of slate roofs had been replaced with asphalt or composite shingle roofs. Other changes, such as modern windows instead of leaded glass and enclosure of porches, were also made, but these tended to be minimal. Additions to homes tend to be very uncommon, although generally in the same architectural style as the original structure."

        "text": "Ryan K Russell (born January 17, 1992) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He played college football at Purdue University.\nEarly years.\nRussell attended Creekview High School. As a senior defensive lineman, he registered 62 tackles (17 for loss) and 5 sacks, while being named second-team All-district.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Purdue University. His best season came as a freshman, playing as a defensive end in a 4-3 defense, registering 11 starts, 33 tackles (4.5 for loss), one sack, 3 forced fumbles and 3 fumbles recovered. As a sophomore, he tallied 13 starts, 37 tackles and 4 sacks.\nAs a junior the team switched to a 3–4 defense in mid-October and he was moved to the Jack linebacker position, recording 11 starts, 35 tackles (5.5 for loss) and 2 sacks.\nAs a senior, he was moved back to defensive end, replacing the graduated Bruce Gaston. He had 44 tackles (6.5 for loss) and 3 sacks, finishing his career as a four-year starter with 149 tackles (25 for loss) and 10 sacks.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nRussell was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (163rd overall) of the 2015 NFL draft, after dropping because his physical skills didn't match his on-field production. In training camp he was tried at left defensive end and at the three-technique defensive tackle positions. During the season, he appeared in one game and was declared inactive in 11. After being limited with an abdomen strain, he was placed on the injured reserve list on December 2, in order to activate offensive tackle Chaz Green from the reserve/PUP list.\nIn the 2016 training camp, he was given the chance to start after the suspensions to defensive ends DeMarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory. On September 3, he was released after struggling during the preseason games. The next day, he was signed to the Cowboys' practice squad. He was released on September 6.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn September 21, 2016, Russell was signed to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on November 12, and had his first career sack against the Seattle Seahawks. He played in 8 games as a reserve defensive end, collecting 4 tackles and one sack.\nIn 2017, he appeared in 14 games, starting the last 7 contests, while registering 17 tackles. He missed the fifth and sixth games with a dislocated left shoulder, which limited him the rest of the year. His 2 sacks came in each of the final two contests. He wasn't re-signed after the season.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn July 29, 2018, Russell signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills. On September 1, he was released by the Bills to reach the league's 53-man roster limit. It was later reported in the media that he had a shoulder injury, which prevented him from playing again that season.\nPersonal life.\nFollowing the death of close friend and former teammate Joseph Gilliam in 2018, Russell suffered from a severe bout of depression. He moved to Los Angeles and began writing.\nIn August 2019, he came out publicly as bisexual in an essay for ESPN. He did so to live honestly and without fear of being outed; he also cited the fear of not being able to support his mother and grandfather if he lost his career. At the same time he introduced his boyfriend Corey O'Brien, a dancer; they opened Corey &amp; Russ, a YouTube channel; as of June 2020, they have over 15,600 followers.\nFormer NFL offensive tackle Ryan O'Callaghan, who came out as gay after he left the league, said that as of August 2019 every NFL team had at least one closeted gay or bisexual player. Sarah McBride, national Press Secretary for Human Rights Campaign, praised Russell for \"creating more space and opportunity for young LGBTQ people to dream big and to pursue their goals\". In April 2021, he penned an article in \"The Guardian\" against the anti-trans laws being proposed in multiple American states, stating that \"sport is one of the strongest conduits to help show society what it is capable of when we come together, but it has to be used for the better of all of us\". He penned another \"The Guardian\" article in July 2022 stating how NFL players that come out typically find themselves unemployed not long after. In 2023, Russell, under the name R.K. Russell, published a memoir, \"\". The book has been optioned for a television series by Sony Pictures TV."

        "text": "The Cricket Writers' Club is an association for cricket journalists working in print, television or radio. It was established in 1947, and contains around 90% of those eligible for membership. During the 1946–47 Ashes series, the Australian and British cricket media spent around eight months travelling around together covering the matches, and during this time they established an informal \"Empire Cricket Writers' Club\". This placed the idea in the minds of a number of journalists for a formal association, and so in June 1947, the Cricket Writers' Club was started. \nAlthough it was established significantly later than other such organisations around the world, it triggered the creation of the Football Writers' Association and the Sports Writers' Association in the United Kingdom within six months. In 1950, the Cricket Writers' Club began awarding a Young Cricketer of the Year award, and have since introduced a number of other awards which are presented at their annual dinner."

        "text": "The Kowloon Tsai Swimming Pool () was the first public swimming pool complex in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Since the old Victoria Park Swimming Pool was demolished in 2014, it stands as the oldest existing public swimming pool in Hong Kong.\nThe pool complex is located in Kowloon Tsai Park and comprises a main 50 metre pool, a leisure pool, and a children's pool.\nHistory.\nIt was decided in 1958 to build a swimming pool in Kowloon. On 5 January 1960 the chairman of the Urban Council announced that a swimming pool would be built at Kowloon Tsai, on an area of land levelled to provide a safer approach for aircraft approaching the new runway at Kai Tak Airport.\nThe pool's construction cost about $3.5 million, of which more than $2 million was contributed by the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. Works began on 30 March 1962 by contractors Hung Yue and Co. The pool's opening date was delayed by slow construction. The complex was finally opened on 5 June 1964 by Governor David Trench and Lady Trench. The Urban Council invited 2,000 children to attend the ceremony. Sir David unveiled a memorial plaque at the pool's entrance and fired a pistol to start the first school swimming race held there.\nKowloon Tsai Swimming Pool was the first public swimming pool in Kowloon, and patronage in the first 30 days of operation averaged 4,784 people per day, well exceeding use of the territory's only other existing pool at Victoria Park. It is located in Kowloon Tsai Park, the first phase of which also opened in 1964. The opening of the pool was publicised internationally in a British Pathé newsreel, which stated a construction cost of £125,000 and highlighted the lack of bathing beaches in the densely populated vicinity. The pools are surrounded by various one-storey buildings housing changing rooms and offices. The pool water was originally supplied by a well sunk under the park specifically for this purpose.\nOriginally, the pool's operation hours would end at 4:00 pm because it was situated under the airport flight path, hence the Civil Aviation Department prohibited the use of outdoor floodlighting there.\nPlanned demolition.\nThe government plans to demolish the pool and replace it with a new complex with indoor and outdoor pools. The Architectural Services Department invited private architectural firms to bid on the project in late 2015."

Based at Neptune Stadium, Neptune is the only basketball club in Ireland with its own stadium.\nHistory.\nThe club's senior men's representative team has won the Irish National League title 11 times. Known as Burgerland Neptune throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the team won seven championships between 1983 and 1991 thanks to American import Terry Strickland and the support of Irish investor Jackie Solan. Neptune won a further four titles between 1995 and 2003. In 2013, Neptune won their fifth National Cup title and first since 1992.\nIn July 2015, Neptune withdrew from the Premier League following a major loss of player personnel, deciding instead to join the second-tiered National League Division 1 for the 2015–16 season. Neptune continued on in Division 1 for the 2016–17 season and subsequently won the 2017 Hula Hoops Presidents Cup. In March 2018, they were promoted back into Basketball Ireland's Men's Super League. After initially being relegated back down to Division 1 following the 2018–19 season, the withdrawal of cross-town rival UCC Demons led to Neptune remaining in the Super League for the 2019–20 season.\nIn the 2021–22 season, Neptune reached the final of both the National Cup and the League playoffs."

        "title": "Jordan Richards (American football)",
        "text": "Jordan Richards (born January 21, 1993) is a former American football safety. He played college football at Stanford and was selected by the New England Patriots in the second round of the 2015 NFL Draft.\nCollege career.\nRichards played college football at Stanford, where he was a team captain and first-team All-Pac-12 Conference player during his final senior collegiate year. Although recruited as one top the top 100 receivers in the country, he was switched to defense and played all 13 games as a true freshman.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nRichards accepted an invitation to play in the 2015 East–West Shrine Game and practiced well throughout the week leading up to the game. He played for the West team under former Seattle Seahawks quarterback and Washington Redskins head coach Jim Zorn. Richards recorded three combined tackles, as the West lost 19–3 to the East. He attended the NFL combine and completed all of the required combine and positional drills. Richards lackluster performances in the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, and broad jump was thought to negatively effect his stock. His time in the three-cone drill finished in the top five amongst all safeties at the combine. On March 19, 2015, Richards opted to participate at Stanford's pro day, along with James Vaughters, Ty Montgomery, Andrus Peat, Lee Ward, A. J. Tarpley, Alex Carter, Henry Anderson, David Parry, and five others. Over 75 team representatives and scouts from every NFL team attended as Richards decided to redo his vertical jump (), broad jump (), 40-yard dash (4.59), 20-yard dash (2.64), 10-yard dash (1.58), and short shuttle (4.32). He performed well and was able to get better times and lengths in everything but the broad jump and short shuttle. His positional drills were led by the New England Patriots' director of player personnel Nick Caserio. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Richards projected to be a fifth to seventh round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and analysts. His fall from a perspective third round pick was mostly due to his lack of preferred athletic ability and his mediocre performance at the combine. He was ranked as the seventh best strong safety prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com and was ranked the 23rd best safety in the draft by NFL analyst Charles Davis.\nNew England Patriots (first stint).\n2015.\nThe Patriots selected Richards in the second round (64th overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. Richards was the fourth safety selected in 2016, behind Damarious Randall (No. 30, Packers), Landon Collins (No. 33, Giants), and Jaquiski Tartt (No. 46, 49ers). His selection in the second round was heavily criticized by draft analysts and the media due to his draft projection being a fifth to seventh round pick and was partially due to the fact the team already had Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung as established starters at safety. Many journalists and analysts speculated his selection by Patriots' head coach/general manager Bill Belichick was due to his solid performance in the three-cone drill, his intelligence, and high football acumen. On May 8, 2015, the Patriots signed Richards to a four-year, $3.71 million contract with $1.15 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $959,307.\nRichards was not able to attend team activities held in the spring due to Stanford following the quarters semester system and the NFL's graduation rule that does not permit players that haven't completed or graduated from their school to attend team activities. Upon arriving at training camp, he competed with Nate Ebner, Tavon Wilson, Duron Harmon, and Brandon King for the role as a backup safety. Head coach Bill Belichick named Richards the backup strong safety behind Chung to start the regular season.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Patriots' season-opening 28–21 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers. On September 27, 2015, Richards recorded two solo tackles and deflected a pass, as the Patriots routed the Jacksonville Jaguars. He made his first career regular season tackle on Jaguars' running back Corey Grant and stopped him after an eight-yard reception in the first quarter. Richards was a healthy scratch and was inactive for two games in Weeks 13–14. On December 20, 2015, Richards earned his first career start and recorded three solo tackles and defended a pass in a 33–16 defeat over the Tennessee Titans. He started at free safety after Devin McCourty was unable to play after sustaining an ankle injury the following week against the Houston Texans. The following week, he earned his second consecutive start at free safety and recorded a season-high seven combined tackles during their 26–20 loss at the New York Jets.\nThe Patriots finished atop the AFC East with a 12–4 record. On January 26, 2016, he played in the first career playoff game as the Patriots defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–20 to advance to the AFC Championship. They suffered a 20–18 loss in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl 50 Champions, the Denver Broncos.\nRichards completed his rookie season with 20 combined tackles (16 solo) and two pass deflections in 14 games and two starts. He played in 21.8% of the Patriots' defensive snaps and 51.4% of all of their special teams play.\n2016.\nRichards entered training camp competing for a job as the backup safety against Ebner, Harmon, King, Brock Vereen, Vinnie Sunseri, and Cedric Thompson. He was named the third strong safety on the depth chart behind Chung and Harmon to begin the season.\nOn November 27, 2016, Richards suffered a knee injury while covering a punt return in the Patriots' 22–17 victory over the Jets. The injury caused him to miss the next three games. He made three combined tackles (one solo) in 11 games and zero starts and was limited to special teams throughout the season.\nThe Patriots finished first in their division with a 14–2 record. On February 5, 2017, the Patriots appeared in Super Bowl LI and defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a 34–28 overtime victory. Richards was a healthy scratch for all three playoff games \n2017.\nRichards started the Patriots' season-opener against the Chiefs and recorded six combined tackles and forced the first fumble of his career in a 42–27 loss. Richards started as a hybrid outside linebacker and was tasked with covering one of the Chiefs' tight ends in dime packages. He recorded twice as many tackles then he did the entire 2016 season and played 41 defensive snaps, well above his total of 16 snaps for 2016. During a Week 6 matchup against the Jets, Richards earned his second start of the season as a hybrid coverage linebacker and recorded three solo tackles in a 24–17 win for New England. Richards helped the Patriots reach Super Bowl LII, but lost 41–33 to the Philadelphia Eagles with Richards recording five tackles in the game.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn August 31, 2018, Richards was traded to the Falcons for a conditional 2020 seventh-round draft pick. He played in 15 games with 12 starts, recording 39 tackles and three passes defensed.\nOakland Raiders.\nOn April 5, 2019, Richards signed with the Oakland Raiders on a one-year deal. He was released during final roster cuts on August 30, 2019.\nNew England Patriots (second stint).\nOn October 2, 2019, Richards was re-signed by the Patriots. He was released on October 22.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nOn October 24, 2019, Richards signed with the Baltimore Ravens. In Week 17 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Richards recovered a punt fumbled by punter Jordan Berry in the end zone for a touchdown during the 28–10 win.\nOn February 13, 2020, Richards signed a one-year contract extension with the Ravens. He was released from the Ravens on September 5, 2020, and signed to the practice squad the next day. He was elevated to the active roster on September 12 for the team's Week 1 game against the Cleveland Browns, and reverted to the practice squad on September 14. He was elevated again on September 19 for the Week 2 game against the Houston Texans, and reverted to the practice squad again after the game. He was promoted to the active roster on September 28, 2020.\nOn January 30, 2021, Richards signed another one-year contract extension with the Ravens.\nOn August 23, 2021, Richards was released by the Ravens and re-signed to the practice squad on September 1, 2021. He was released on September 8, 2021. On September 28, 2021, Richards was re-signed with to the Ravens practice squad. He was released again on October 27, 2021. He was re-signed on November 8, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nRichards is a Folsom High School alumnus along with many other professional sports players. His father, Terry, a native of Natick, Massachusetts, played football at Tufts University from 1975-1979 as a defensive lineman. Richards majored in public policy at Stanford."

        "text": "The women's individual archery event at the 2015 Pan American Games was held from 14 to 18 July 2015 at the Varsity Stadium in Toronto, Canada. One of five archery events as part of the 2015 Pan American sporting programme, it was the tenth time the women's individual recurve competition had been contested at the Games. Thirty-two archers from thirteen nations qualified for the event.\nThe defending champion from the 2011 Pan American Games was Alejandra Valencia of Mexico. As she had achieved four years previously, Valencia was seeded first following the 72-arrow ranking round but was unexpectedly defeated by Colombia's Maira Sepulveda in the 1/8 elimination round. Five-time Olympic athlete Khatuna Lorig of the United States emerged as champion, defeating Colombia's Ana Rendón in the final in four sets to take her first Pan American gold medal. Valencia's Mexican teammates Aída Román and Karla Hinojosa contested the bronze medal match, Hinojosa defeating the 2012 Olympic silver medalist to take third place.\nBackground.\nAn individual archery event for women has been a part of the Pan American Games programme since the sport's debut in 1979 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The United States was the dominant nation in terms of gold medals won in the event, and at the previous Pan American Games held in 2011 in Guadalajara, Mexico, Alejandra Valencia became the second archer from outside the United States to win the women's individual gold medal, following Yaremis Pérez Ruiz of Cuba in 1999. Valencia's victory over the American Miranda Leek four years previously also marked the first Mexican win in a Pan American archery event. Her compatriot Aída Román won the bronze medal ahead of Venezuela's Leidys Brito.\nQualification.\nThere were thirty-two places available for the women's individual event, with the host nation Canada automatically receiving three spots. Qualification for the remaining twenty-nine positions took place over three tournaments: the Pan American Olympic Festival held in July 2014, the Pan American Championships in October 2014, and a final qualification round in March 2015. Eight nations (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela) also successfully qualified the maximum berth of three archers, with the Dominican Republic qualifying two and Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala qualifying one archer apiece.\nMexico selected the defending bronze medalist from the 2015 Pan American Games, and silver medalist from the 2012 Summer Olympics, Aída Román to spearhead their three-member team, with defending champion Alejandra Valencia and Karla Hinojosa rounding out the squad. The United States entered a team of mixed experience, pairing five-time Olympian Khatuna Lorig alongside Ariel Gibilaro and La Nola Pritchard, who both made their Pan American Games debut. The head of the United States national archery organisation Denise Parker, herself the 1987 and 1991 Pan American Games individual women's champion, said 2015 represented a \"season of change\" in the United States archery team with the selection of newcomers in both the women's and men's teams. She however pointed to the a bronze medal won at the 2015 Archery World Cup stage held in Shanghai in May as proof of the women's potential for success.\nGeorcy-Stéphanie Picard and Virginie Chénier were selected as part of the Canadian team after finishing first and second in the Canadian national trials, partnering Kateri Vrakking who finished third. The 41-year old Vrakking, a five-time national champion, had been initially passed over as Canada's third entry with Archery Canada, the national archery organisation, instead selecting as their third representative nineteen year-old Shannon Davidson, who had finished fifth in the national trials. Following accusations of age discrimination, which Archery Canada denied, and threats of legal action, Davidson's selection was reversed and Vrakking was named to the team.\nYesenia Valencia was chosen to represent Guatemala at their maiden appearance at a Pan American Games women's archery event, having won a position in the final qualification round in March 2015.\nReport.\nPre-event.\nPrior to the beginning of the competition, Mexican sports newspaper \"Esto\" reported that reigning champion Alejandra Valencia expressed doubts that she would retain her title to become the first back-to-back Pan American female individual archery champion. Valencia stated instead that her target was simply to perform well and beat her own personal records. In preparation for the Games, the Mexican archery squad had pitted the women's team of Valencia, Aída Román and Karla Hinojosa against the men's team of Juan René Serrano, Luis Álvarez and Ernesto Boardman and held practice rounds in the rain. Román, who had been named by Mexican news agency Notimex as the world's best archer of 2014, aimed to improve on her bronze medal achievement in Guadalajara four years earlier.\nRanking round.\nThe event commenced with the ranking round on the morning of 14 July amid spells of light rain and gusts of wind. Alejandra Valencia topped the ranking round for the second Pan American Games in a row, heading the table on 655 points. Fellow Mexican Aída Román finished in second with an identical score of 655 points, but was seeded second after shooting one fewer arrow inside the central 10 ring. Khatuna Lorig and Karla Hinojosa both tied on 651 points to rank third and fourth respectively.\nKateri Vrakking was the highest scoring Canadian archer, finishing with the 14th seed on 612 points. Vrakking's teammates Georcy-Stéphanie Picard and Virginie Chenier were not far behind, ending the round 15th and 18th respectively and setting up an all-Canadian tie in the first elimination round. Vrakking expressed satisfaction with her performance, stating she was feeling confident ahead of the knock-out rounds after finding her rhythm. She added that she was unperturbed by the intermittent drizzle or the home crowd in attendance, which Justin Skinner of the Toronto newspaper \"The City Centre Mirror\" described as \"sizeable\" despite the weather.\nElimination rounds.\nCool and windy conditions continued into the morning of 15 July, which proved challenging for many of the archers. Khatuna Lorig began by defeating Elena Abullerade in the opening round, ending El Salvador's participation in the event. Argentina's trio of Ximena Mendiberry, Fernanda Faisal, and Florencia Lenhold Juárez were all also eliminated in the first round. In the all-Canadian affair between Picard and Chenier, Picard came back from two sets down to force and ultimately win the subsequent one-arrow shoot-off, placing her arrow in the 8-ring to Chenier's attempt in the 7-ring. As the two both belonged to the same archery club and shared the same coach, Chenier described the match as \"like training, but with a little more people and more nervousness\". Despite her loss, Chenier expressed satisfaction with her shooting, and the pair's coach Sylvain Cadieux praised their performances, saying they each knew what to expect from one another and that he was pleased that the match came down to a shoot-off.\nThe 1/8 elimination round, the second knock-out round of the competition, began with top seed Valencia losing in five sets to Colombia's Maira Sepulveda, who finished 16th in the ranking round, while Valencia's Mexican teammates Román and Hinojoa defeated Picard and Sarah Nikitin of Brazil respectively to advance to the quarter-finals. Picard said afterwards that she felt she had played better than in her earlier match against Chenier, but was unable to fully master the gusts of winds that pushed her arrows towards the right, bowing out of the tournament to Román in straight sets. Román admitted that it took time for her to adapt to the 14 °C air temperature, but was able to play her best towards the end of the day's session, which concluded with the quarter-finals at 11am. Román defeated Cuba's Maydenia Sarduy to progress to the semi-finals to face Khatuna Lorig, while Hinojosa beat Colombia's Natalia Sanchez to face off against Sanchez's compatriot Ana Rendón in the other last four contest, a result that exceeded her own expectations.\nThe final rounds of the competition began three days later on the morning of 18 July with the two semi-final matches. In the first match Rendón was too strong for Hinojosa, the Mexican failing to land an arrow in the target's central 10 ring as the Colombian won in straight sets to advance to the final. She was joined in the gold medal match by Lorig, whose match with Román was a tight affair which necessitated a one-arrow shoot-off after the two could not be split after five sets. Lorig's winning shot was determined to be closer to the centre of the target by a matter of centimetres and was thus declared the winner. Notimex described the result as a \"bitter déjà vu\" for Román, who had experienced a loss in similar circumstances in the final of the women's individual event at the 2012 Summer Olympics against South Korea's Ki Bo-bae, in which Román finished with the silver medal.\nMedal matches.\nThe matches determining the medal winners commenced immediately after the semi-final encounters. As the two losing archers from the semi-finals, Hinojosa and Román met to decide the bronze medal match. Hinojosa's win over Román in five sets was considered a surprise by Notimex, and \"Esto\" characterised the encounter as an apprentice winning against a master in their report of the match, highlighting that Hinojosa on her Pan American Games debut overcame her vastly more experienced and Olympic medalist teammate. In an interview following the match Hinojosa dedicated her bronze medal victory to her parents and her friends and set her sights on securing a spot for the 2015 World Archery Championships. She also expressed her admiration for Román, stating that defeating Román gave her motivation to put in more effort, \"because Aída will never give up.\"\nIn the gold medal final Lorig won comfortably over Rendón, earning the United States their first and only archery title at the 2015 Games. Nick Butler of \"Inside the Games\" called her win \"the biggest of her illustrious career\", which came on a day that saw a flurry of gold medals for the United States and helped them topple Canada from the head of the Pan American Games medal table. Rendon's silver medal was the eighth achieved by Colombia at the 2015 Pan American Games and her second after her gold medal victory in the women's team event."

It was the first tour of Pakistan by a Test-playing nation since the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in 2009. Pakistan won the T20I series 2–0 and won the ODI series 2–0 after the third match finished as a no result. It was Pakistan's first ODI series win in two years. Pakistan ODI captain Azhar Ali said \"it's been an exciting and emotional series for many reasons. It became important for us, as many of us never played in Pakistan, and winning makes it more significant because it gives you confidence\".\nSummary.\nBefore the tour, several Zimbabwean cricketers expressed their concerns about travelling to Pakistan, but were committed to the trip. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq had described the tour as \"a big joy for all of Pakistan cricket fans, players and for the PCB officials\". Tony Irish, the executive chairman of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA), said that \"we are very concerned about the safety of players and any match officials who may be sent to Pakistan, should this tour go ahead\". The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that it was awaiting the outcome of a security report before deciding if it were to send officials, with the possibility that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) would use its own officials if the ICC was unable to supply them.\nZimbabwe Cricket (ZC) were in talks with its own government regarding concerns over security. ZC caused confusion after issuing a press release on 14 May stating the tour had been suspended, but they retracted it just 15 minutes later. On 17 May ZC confirmed that the tour would go ahead. The ICC did not appoint any of its match officials, but made provision for the PCB to use their own umpires. The Zimbabwe team received state guest importance, including more than 4,000 police officers for their security when they arrived in Pakistan at Allama Iqbal International Airport on 19 May to start the tour.\nOnly five players in the Pakistan T20 squad had played a home international match before this tour. Batsman Umar Akmal said that \"it will be an amazing feeling, it would mean so much to me. Cricketers around the world take playing at home in front of their own crowds for granted\". Tickets for both of the T20 matches sold out within two days, with 60,000 people attending the first game.\nIn the ODI series, Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura was suspended for the last two matches, due to a bowling a slow over-rate in the first match. Hamilton Masakadza became the Zimbabwean captain for the final two matches in Chigumbura's absence.\nDuring the second ODI match, there was a loud explosion outside the stadium that was thought to have been caused by an electricity transformer. It was later revealed to be a suicide attack that killed a civilian and a Punjab Police officer, while he was trying to stop the suicide bomber. The initial report of the transformer explosion was used to avoid a panic. Despite the attack, the third and final match of the series went ahead as scheduled.\nAfter the matches had concluded, it was revealed that the PCB had paid the players in the Zimbabwe squad US$12,500 each for the tour. This was paid in two amounts, the first when Zimbabwe arrived in Pakistan, and the second after the tour dates had been fulfilled."

        "title": "2015 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 2015 Belmont Stakes (known as the 147th Belmont Stakes presented by DraftKings for sponsorship reasons) was the 147th in the Belmont Stakes series. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\" and sometimes called the \"final jewel\" in thoroughbred horse racing's traditional Triple Crown series, was held on June 6, 2015, three weeks after the Preakness Stakes and five weeks after the Kentucky Derby. The Belmont Stakes was the 11th race of a 13 race card which included 10 stakes races. Post time for race 11 was 6:52 pm EDT.\nAfter winning both the 2015 Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, American Pharoah won the Belmont and became the first horse to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. As the 12th Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah ran the race in 2:26.65 which was the sixth-fastest of all time and the second-fastest (following only Secretariat in 1973) amongst Triple Crown winners.\nPre-race.\nThe New York Racing Association, which runs Belmont Park, located in Elmont, New York, announced that attendance for the event would be limited to 90,000. By Friday, June 5, all tickets had been sold out. To ease congestion at Belmont Station from racing fans leaving the venue, which led to hours-long waits the previous year, the Long Island Rail Road invested $4 million to improve mass transit in the area, and the New York Racing Association put in another $1 million. The LIRR added platforms to accommodate 10-car trains, positioned additional empty trains along the branch line to allow more trains to move out of the station, and upgraded staircases and signs. They also altered the schedule at other stations along the branch line to move more trains through Belmont Station. To slow down the flow of people leaving at the same time, the NYRA also brought in the Goo Goo Dolls to perform a post-race concert. On May 29, 2015, the NYRA announced that the daily fantasy sports service DraftKings had acquired presenting sponsorship rights to the race. The deal, whose financial terms were undisclosed, included branding across the event site, the awarding of VIP tickets to a league winner through a promotion, and advertising exclusivity during NBC's telecast of the event.\nTwo weeks before the event the connections for several horses announced that they would be entering the race after bypassing the Preakness Stakes. These included the following participants of the 2015 Kentucky Derby: Frosted, who finished fourth; Materiality, sixth; Keen Ice, seventh; Mubtaahij, eighth; Carpe Diem, tenth; Frammento, eleventh; and War Story, who was sixteenth. When the field was ultimately drawn for the race on June 3, Carpe Diem and War Story were not entered. A total of eight horses were to participate, all but one of whom had run in either the Derby or, as was the case of Tale of Verve, in the Preakness. The exception was Madefromlucky, who won the Peter Pan Stakes and had last faced American Pharoah in the Arkansas Derby. Every horse entered was a descendant, through his sire, of Mr. Prospector.\nAmerican Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks. Of the group, Frosted, who ran wide on the turn in the Kentucky Derby but rallied strongly to finish fourth, just three lengths from the lead, was considered by some commentators to pose the strongest challenge to American Pharoah. While acknowledging that a Triple Crown win \"is something every single person is rooting for\", Justin Zayat, of Zayat Stables, LLC, which owns American Pharoah, anticipated a strong run from Materiality.\nRace description.\nThe day began with a rainstorm early in the morning which stopped after about an hour. The inner two-thirds of the track were sealed by the maintenance crew, and the track was rated fast by the 11:35 a.m. post time of the first race. The Belmont took place under sunny skies.\nAmerican Pharoah, ridden by jockey Victor Espinoza, was leaning back in the starting gate when it opened and was a touch late at the start, but he soon pulled out to an early lead, which he maintained for a gate-to-wire win. American Pharoah steadily increased his lead throughout the race. He was challenged by Materiality until the top of the stretch when Materiality faded, ultimately finishing last, and Frosted pulled into second. Keen Ice ran in the middle of the pack until a late rally brought him into third over Mubtaahij, who was fourth. American Pharoah crossed the finish line leading by lengths, with a winning time of 2:26:65 for the race, the second fastest among Triple Crown winners. His margin of victory was the fourth-largest for a Triple Crown winner at the Belmont Stakes. American Pharoah was also the first Belmont winner since Afleet Alex in 2005 to have run all three Triple Crown races.\nThe win was the fourth attempt at a Triple Crown for trainer Bob Baffert, who at age 62 was the second-oldest trainer to win a Triple Crown. It was the third attempt for jockey Victor Espinoza, who was the first Latino jockey to win the Triple Crown, and, at age 43, the oldest at the time.\nChart.\nSource:\nTimes: — 0:24.06; — 0:48.83; — 1:13.41; mile—1:37.99; —2:02.33; final—2:26.65.\nFractional Splits: (:24.06) (:24.77) (:24.58) (:24.58) (:24.34) (:24.32)\nPayout.\nThe 147th Belmont Payout Schedule"

        "title": "Hong Kong Golf Association",
        "text": "The Hong Kong Golf Association (HKGA) is Hong Kong's national golf association. The HKGA is primarily concerned with managing and overseeing the development of the sport of golf in Hong Kong. The HKGA provides guidance on the running of national championships, supports in the training of players, and also helps to finance a national team that represents Hong Kong in international competitions. The HKGA currently oversees 40 amateur tournaments annually, and is involved in the running of The Hong Kong Open.\nIn addition, the HKGA also provides a centralised handicapping service for more than 15,000 subscribers that conforms to standards set by the USGA.\nHistory.\nThe establishment of the HKGA was predicated by a growing interest in the game of golf by the local population of Hong Kong. While golf had been in Hong Kong since around 1889, it was primarily the domain of the expatriate population. This developing interest in golf by locals created the need for an authoritative body to oversee the development of the sport.\nThe HKGA was officially established in 1968 to co-ordinate efforts in growing the game of golf in Hong Kong. The organisation now acts as the governing body for amateur golf in Hong Kong.\nOrganisational structure.\nThe HKGA has an Executive Committee formed through the membership of constituent golf clubs in Hong Kong. These clubs include the Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club, Discovery Bay Golf Club, The Hong Kong Golf Club, and Shek O Country Club.\nThe Executive Committee includes a President, Vice-President, and Delegates from each of the four constituent clubs (as well as alternates from each club), an Honorary Secretary, and an Honorary Treasurer position. The positions of President and Vice-President are assigned annually through a rotating nomination by the four constituent clubs.\nHong Kong national teams.\nThe HKGA has focused on building an internationally competitive national team through the financing of a developmental squad training programme. Currently, the HKGA has both a Men's and a Women’s National Team. Selection for these teams is based largely on tournament performance. The majority of national team players are ranked as top amateurs by the World Amateur Golf Rankings.\nInitiatives.\nIn addition to building and supporting a competitive national team, the HKGA is also involved in several other golf-focused initiatives. These initiatives have facilitated a growing interest in golf by the local population of Hong Kong. The HKGA now supports more than 1,600 junior golfers, and has over 100 individuals in its junior development programme.\nHSBC Junior Golf Programme.\nAn effort to provide Hong Kong's youth with a structured introduction to golf. The programme includes various initiatives, such as the HSBC Golf for Schools Programme, the HSBC Junior Development Programme, and the organisation of a match between top junior golfers from Hong Kong and China.\nHSBC Golf for Schools Programme.\nThis programme provides children between the ages of 6–12 with the opportunity to try golf at their local schools through an introductory training system called ShortGolf. The primary goal of the programme is to introduce golf to primary school students across Hong Kong, and to make the sport more accessible by providing children the opportunity to be exposed to golf. The programme also provides basic-level golf instruction to teachers so that they will be able to continue lessons independently. The program has seen great support. In 2014 at the Hong Kong Open, golfing professionals Robert-Jan Derksen and Liang Wen-Chong ran a seminar open to the public for all four-tournament days. The program concludes with on-course golf lessons, and the opportunity to earn an official HKGA handicap index.\nHSBC Junior Development Programme.\nA talent-identification programme that tracks performance in HKGA-sanctioned junior tournaments. Top performers are offered the chance to become part of the HKGA Junior Squad for weekly coaching and talent development.\nHKGA squads.\nThe HKGA supports several different golfing squads with the primary mission of developing golfing talent in Hong Kong. These squads include: the Junior Squad, the Elite Junior Squad, the Men’s and Ladies’ Squad, and the Hong Kong National Team. Invitations are extended based on performance at pre-defined local tournaments, performance at talent identification days, or on the recommendation of a golf professional. Minimum handicap requirements are also set.\nJunior Squad.\nThe entry-level HKGA squad that provides a structured instructional development programme for Hong Kong’s top junior golfers under the age of 18. The programme includes weekly training classes, on-course practice, tournament entry, and other development initiatives.\nElite Junior Squad.\nTop Junior Squad members are promoted to the Elite Junior Squad, which consists of golfers between the ages of 11 and 17.\nMen's and Ladies' squads.\nTop Elite Junior Squad members are promoted to the HKGA Men’s and Ladies’ squads once they have reached the age of 18.\nHong Kong National Team.\nThe Hong Kong National Team consists of the top golfers in Hong Kong. There is no set age restriction, and eligibility is determined by performance. In addition to attending training sessions and participating in tournaments, National Squad members are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the game by attaining at least a Level 1 R&amp;A rule accreditation certification.\nTournaments.\nCurrently, the HKGA runs 40 different amateur men's, women's, and junior golf tournaments annually. With the best-known of these being the Hong Kong Open Championship, a professional tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours."

        "title": "David Levin (ice hockey)",
        "text": "David Levin (, ; born September 16, 1999) is an Israeli professional ice hockey player. He currently plays for HSC Csíkszereda in the Erste Liga (ice hockey).\nHe previously played for the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and for Dinamo Riga of the Kontinental Hockey League.\nBorn in Israel, Levin initially only played inline hockey due to the scarcity of ice rinks in Israel. At the age of 12 he moved to Canada in order to pursue a hockey career, living with relatives in the Greater Toronto Area, and it was in Canada that Levin first played organized ice hockey. He was drafted first overall in the 2015 OHL Priority Selection, and began playing for the Wolves in the 2015–16 season. Internationally Levin has played for the Israel national team.\nPersonal life.\nLevin was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Pavel and Lena Levin, and is Jewish. Pavel is originally from Riga, Latvia, and was a professional soccer player in Latvia before signing with Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. in 1990 and moving to Israel. He retired soon after due to a leg injury, and married Lena, who was from Moscow and moved to Netanya, Israel, and then to Zoran, Israel. David has a younger brother, Mike, who in 2018 as a 13-year-old had already received offers from the Vaughan Kings and Toronto Junior Canadians of the Greater Toronto Hockey League.\nLevin was eight years old when he first discovered North American ice hockey, as his father was watching an NHL game on TV. \"I asked him what he's watching. He told me that's the best league in the world, so I told him that's my dream now,\" Levin told \"The Jerusalem Post\". At home Levin spoke Russian, while in school he used Hebrew; prior to moving to Canada he did not speak any English, and in order to develop a facility with English he decided to not attend a Hebrew-language school.\nDue to the scarcity of ice rinks in Israel, with the closest rink a four-hour drive, Levin grew up playing inline hockey at a roller rink in Netanya, starting when he was four-years-old. He played starting in 2010 in several tournaments in Europe for the Israeli national inline team, winning awards in the process, but desired to play ice hockey instead. While he tried skating at the Canada Center in Metula, it did not go well and his ice hockey dream faded until he saw a YouTube clip of the development of player Sidney Crosby.\nWhen he was 12, and despite not speaking English, Levin moved to Richmond Hill, Ontario, in the York Region, in order to further his hockey career, and lived with his aunt, uncle, and cousin Alla, Yafim and Rebecca Tovberg, who had previously lived in Israel. The Tovbergs subsequently moved into Toronto so that Levin would be able to play in a more competitive league.\nAs an Israeli citizen, Levin is required to serve three years with the Israel Defence Forces, and had to register for the draft when he turned 18 in September 2017. However, as that much time away from playing hockey would effectively end his career, he was able to obtain a deferment - initially until June 2018, after the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. He is now expected to return to Israel to serve when he is 26 years old.\nPlaying career.\nLevin attended The Hill Academy in Vaughan, just north of Toronto, a school known for developing elite sports talent. He also joined the Greater Toronto Hockey League's Don Mills Flyers, an Ontario triple-A junior club in the highest youth hockey division, for the 2014–15 season, which named him alternate captain. During that season he scored 39 goals and 41 assists for 80 points in 55 games. Don Mills made the league final, with Levin tying for the tournament lead in scoring, though they lost in overtime.\nHowever, because Levin was originally from Israel and did not live with his parents, the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), one of three major junior hockey leagues in Canada, was not going to allow him to enter the 2015 OHL Priority Selection; instead he would have had to wait another year and enter the league as an import (a foreign player). This was appealed, with the argument that his aunt and uncle were both his legal guardians and Canadian citizens, and Levin was granted an exception.\nAllowed to be drafted, the Sudbury Wolves in Ontario selected the 15-year-old Levin first overall, and he was awarded the Jack Ferguson Award, awarded to the first-overall selection, as a result. Sudbury coach David Matsos said: \"You can teach a lot of things. You can teach kids how to skate better, put weight on and do those sorts of things in the weight room. But you can't teach hockey sense. This guy thinks at a different level. He is probably one of the most elite, skilled players that I've seen.\" Levin noted: \"Coincidentally, the main colors of the Sudbury jersey are the Israeli colors of blue and white. Because that makes me think of Israel, when I'm stepping on the ice, I try to do my best for people in Israel including those who think they can be hockey players too. I want to show everyone they should never give up.\"\nLevin played his first OHL game in September 2015 just after turning 16 years old, and finished the 2015–16 season with nine goals and 21 assists (30 points) in 41 games, though he missed 19 games due to a broken hand. He also playing 5 games for Canada Black in the World U-17 Hockey Challenge.\nHe improved in the 2016–17 season to 18 goals and 35 assists for 53 points in 66 games, good for second on the team in scoring, and helped Sudbury reach the playoffs, where he was second on the team with six points in six games.\nIn the 2017–18 season, he was an alternate captain on Sudbury, and had an injury-plagued season and fell to 29 points in 46 games.\nIn the 2018–19 season, he sustained a knee injury in late October 2018 that resulted in him missing the majority of the second half of the season.\nAfter the 2019–20 season, in which Levin had 27 goals and 46 assists in 57 contests, he received the Gord Ewin Most Improved Award with the Wolves. As of 2020, he had the eighth-most games played in a Wolves uniform, at 259.\nHe attended the 2018 Toronto Maple Leafs development camp, and played in the 2018 Traverse City NHL rookie prospect tournament with the Carolina Hurricanes. In September 2019, he attended rookie camp with Arizona Coyotes, and participated in the Coyotes main veteran's training camp.\nOn October 23, 2020, Levin signed a tryout contract with Dinamo Riga of the Kontinental Hockey League. After playing 14 games and scoring 1 goal in the KHL, he moved to HC Zemgale/LUA of the Latvian Hockey Higher League. He ended the season in Kristianstads IK, the last-placed team in the HockeyAllsvenskan, and helped them avoid relegation to the Hockeyettan with a win in a survival play-in series.\nOn July 22, 2021, Levin signed with the Bratislava Capitals of the ICE Hockey League. Following his tenure with Bratislava, in September 2022, Levin agreed to terms with UK EIHL side Nottingham Panthers.\nFor the 2023–24 season, Levin moved to Romania to join Erste Liga side HSC Csíkszereda.\nInternational play.\nIn 2015 Levin was invited to try out at the Hockey Canada under-17 development camp, and was selected to play on one of the three teams Canada sent to the World U-17 Hockey Challenge. At the 2015 tournament he recorded one assist in five games. The World U-17 Hockey Challenge is not sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), so Levin is not regarded as a Canadian for international play, and is still eligible to play for the Israel men's national ice hockey team; however, he has expressed an interest to play for Canada in the future. He joined the Israeli national team for the 2023 World Championship Division IIA tournament.\nPlaying style.\nWhen he first joined Sudbury, Levin was praised for his offensive skills. Throughout his time with the Wolves, Levin was recognized for his hockey sense. David Matsos, his coach there, called him \"one of the most elite, skilled players\" he'd ever seen; this Levin credited to his father, who served as his first coach in Israel and runs a hockey school there. Levin also developed his defensive skills during his second season with Sudbury, which he showed during the 2017 playoffs. Due to his late start to ice skating, Levin's major weakness was originally his overall skating, though he worked to improve it."

        "title": "South Florida Bulls baseball",
        "text": "The South Florida Bulls baseball team is the intercollegiate men's baseball program representing the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. The team competes in the American Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I. Founded in 1966, the baseball team is one of the oldest teams at the university. The Bulls have captured eleven conference titles (six regular season and five tournament) and 14 NCAA tournament appearances. The team plays their home games on campus at USF Baseball Stadium at Red McEwen Field and are coached by Billy Mohl.\nHistory.\nBeefy Wright era.\nThe baseball team was founded in spring 1966 as one of the original varsity sports teams at USF. Beefy Wright was the first coach of the team. They played most home games during their first season at Al Lopez Field in West Tampa, around 12 miles from campus, but some games were played at Cuscaden Field in Tampa's Ybor City neighborhood. The Bulls first played as independents in the NCAA College Division, now known as Division II. For their second season the team started playing at a new on-campus stadium originally known as USF Baseball Field, and later called Red McEwen Field.\nThough the team had winning records in five of their first eight seasons, they were never selected for the NCAA tournament. In 1973, the final season in the College Division, second baseman Mike Campbell was named the first All-American in program history. They moved to NCAA Division I beginning in 1974. On March 8, 1974, just the sixth game for the team since joining Division I, Steve Ruling threw the first no-hitter in USF baseball history to complete a sweep against UConn. Beefy Wright left the school after the 1974 season, and was replaced by Jack Butterfield.\nJack Butterfield era.\nDespite only coaching the team for two seasons, Jack Butterfield led the Bulls to their two best records ever up to that point. To this day, Butterfield has the best winning percentage of any USF baseball coach (.715). He left after the 1976 season to become a scout for the New York Yankees.\nRobin Roberts era.\nRobin Roberts took over the team in 1977. Roberts had been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame the year prior for his 18-year MLB pitching career, most notably with the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1978, the school's first season in the Sun Belt Conference, he was named the Sun Belt coach of the year. He would be given this honor again in 1980, 1981, and 1982. In 1982, Roberts' Bulls won the regular season and tournament Sun Belt titles, the first two conference titles for the baseball team. This came after a season in which the Bulls went 45–13 (a .776 win percentage), which stands to this day as their best-ever record. They qualified for their first NCAA tournament, where they lost in the regional round to eventual national champion Miami.\nRoberts would coach the Bulls until his retirement in 1985. In a ceremony before his final game, Roberts had his number 36 jersey retired by the team and honored on the outfield wall. He was the first to have his number retired by the USF baseball team.\nEddie Cardieri era.\nEddie Cardieri, an assistant under Roberts since the 1983 season, was promoted to be Roberts' replacement for 1986. He immediately found success, and the Bulls won the regular season and tournament Sun Belt titles in his first season, while Cardieri was named Sun Belt coach of the year. In the regional final of the 1986 NCAA tournament, they lost to eventual national runner-up Florida State.\nThe Bulls next qualified for the NCAA tournament in 1989 following a regular season Sun Belt championship. They were once again eliminated in the regional round by Florida State, who would end up in the semifinal of the College World Series. The following season, the Bulls made it to the NCAA tournament for the third time in their history after winning both the regular season and tournament Sun Belt titles again, and Cardieri was again named the Sun Belt coach of the year. These would be their last Sun Belt titles as they moved to the Metro Conference beginning with the next season.\nAgainst Charlotte on May 9, 1992, USF's Mark Reed threw the first and only perfect game in USF baseball history. The Bulls won the first and only title of their short stint in the Metro Conference with the 1993 regular season conference championship. Cardieri was named as the Metro Conference coach of the year for that season, and the Bulls were given an at-large bid for the NCAA tournament.\nThe Metro Conference merged with the Great Midwest Conference to form Conference USA beginning in the 1995 season. USF won the regular season and tournament titles for the inaugural year of the new conference, and appeared in the first of three straight NCAA tournaments. They appeared in the NCAA tournament again in 2001 and 2002 before moving from Conference USA to the Big East Conference in 2005.\nEddie Cardieri resigned after a 23–35 season in 2006, his 21st year with the Bulls. He stands today as by far the winningest coach in USF baseball history with 731 victories (Robin Roberts, the next winningest coach in team history, only had 262 wins).\nLelo Prado era.\nLouisville head coach Lelo Prado, who grew up in Tampa, was hired by USF to fill Cardieri's shoes for the 2007 season. He formerly played and coached for the Division II University of Tampa and led them to two national titles as coach. Despite the Bulls posting winning records in five of Prado's eight seasons (including 2009 when Prado was Big East coach of the year), they never won a conference title or appeared in an NCAA tournament. Prado stepped down to an advisory role following the 2014 season, and in 2018 became an assistant athletic director at USF.\nMark Kingston era.\nIllinois State head coach Mark Kingston was hired as Prado's replacement. In 2015, his first season, he brought the Bulls back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2002. In 2017, he did it again on top of the team earning their best record in over 20 years. He left to become the head coach at South Carolina after the 2017 season.\nBilly Mohl era.\nUSF pitching coach Billy Mohl was promoted to the head coaching job beginning in 2018. He brought the Bulls to the NCAA tournament in his first season. In 2021, his Bulls were predicted to finish last of the eight teams in the American Athletic Conference in the annual media day poll, and ended the regular season in sixth. The team got hot at the perfect time, however, and reached the championship game of the AAC tournament where they defeated rival Central Florida for their first conference title in 25 years. They stayed hot in the NCAA tournament and defeated powerhouses Florida and Miami in the Gainesville Regional to qualify for their first-ever Super Regional, where they lost to No. 2 Texas. Two years later however, after losing most of the notable members of the 2021 Super Regional team to the MLB Draft, the Bulls had their worst season since their inaugural year with a record of just 21–39.\nUSF Baseball Stadium.\nOpened in 2012 on the same site as the former stadium, Red McEwen Field, the USF Baseball Stadium is a 1,500-seat facility with the potential to hold a capacity crowd of 3,211.\nIndividuals.\nPlayers.\nPerfect Games.\nThere has been one perfect game thrown in USF history:\nNo Hitters.\nBulls pitchers have thrown three no hitters in school history (not including Reed's perfect game):\nMajor Leaguers.\nSouth Florida has produced 127 players drafted into Major League Baseball including four first round selections. 19 of these players have gone on to play in the MLB, including two active players.\nAll-Americans.\nSeven members of South Florida baseball teams have been selected as First Team All-Americans.\nConference Player of the Year.\nFour Bulls have been named the conference player of the year.\nCoaches.\nConference Coach of the Year.\nUSF head coaches have won 10 conference coach of the year awards.\nUSF Athletic Hall of Fame members.\nTwo USF baseball players have been inducted into the USF Athletic Hall of Fame:\nMedia.\nUnder the current American Athletic Conference TV deal, all home and in-conference away baseball games are shown on one of the various ESPN networks or streamed live on ESPN+. Live radio broadcasts of baseball games are also available worldwide for free on the Bulls Unlimited digital radio station on TuneIn."

        "title": "Alliance (esports)",
        "text": "Alliance is a professional gaming and esports organization based in Sweden that was formed in April 2013. They have teams in \"TrackMania\", \"Dota 2\", \"Hearthstone\", the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, \"Fortnite\", \"Apex Legends\" and \"VALORANT\", and previously had teams in \"League of Legends\" and \"StarCraft II\".\nIn December 2016, the organisation announced that it had become player-owned after parting with its parent organisation, GoodGame agency which was owned by Amazon through its subsidiary Twitch. The \"Dota 2\" team won The International 2013, then the largest single prize money payout in esports history. The \"League of Legends\" team is one of the five teams that won a season of European League of Legends Championship Series with Fnatic, G2 Esports, Mad Lions and Rogue.\nHistory.\nThe organization was founded in April 2013, picking up the Dota 2 team No Tidehunter as well as player Naniwa.\nThe organization expanded into \"League of Legends\" in December 2013, which competed in European League of Legends Championship Series. They entered \"Super Smash Bros.\" in November 2014 with the signing of Armada, a Fox and Peach player.\nAlliance left \"StarCraft II\" in July 2014 with the release of their last player, SortOf. The League of Legends team was rebranded as Elements in January 2015 due to the team ownership rules in the League of Legends Championship Series preventing GoodGame Agency from owning multiple teams.\nOn 12 December 2016, Twitch spun Evil Geniuses and Alliance into player-owned organizations. According to Alliance member Jonathan Berg, all original members in addition to Armada got a percentage of the company.\n\"Dota 2\".\nA few months after being picked up by Alliance, the \"Dota 2\" team won The International 2013, defeating former TI champions Natus Vincere in the grand finals 3–2. The team finished the group stages with a perfect 14–0 record, and only lost 3 games throughout the whole tournament (losing 1 game to Team DK, and the aforementioned 2 games to Na'Vi).\nAt The International 2014, the defending champions failed to make it out of the group stages, finishing tied for 11th place with a 6–9 record. After the tournament, their long stable roster fell apart, with the departure of Gustav \"s4\" Magnusson, Henrik \"AdmiralBulldog\" Ahnberg, and Jerry \"EGM\" Lundkvist.\nWhile Starladder i-League is ongoing, Alliance announce the departure of MyNuts and use Kebap as a Standin for their series against Virtus.Pro\nThe team welcomes their previous teammate EGM back to Alliance\nThey would go on to win both WCA, the biggest prize pool event that was not directed by Valve, beating LGD in a best of 5; with a score of 3–2. Following this they went to Starladder almost missing the tournament due to weather complications. Despite a rocky start the team beat out TI reigning champions Evil Geniuses 2–0 in a best of three in the final. After their back to back victories at lans the team decided to drop out of the upcoming tournaments and focus on the Shanghai Major.\nThe team split up after the sixth rendition of the International, which resulted in AdmiralBulldog retiring to pursue streaming full-time, and Akke retiring to pursue a career in programing and S4 joining OG. S4 went on to win the Boston Major and the Kiev major, after leaving Alliance for OG.\nThe post TI6-shuffle squad featured former Ninjas in Pajamas players Limmp, Handsken and Jonassomfan as well as Loda and EGM. This squad had mediocre success failing to qualify for any major events during the TI6-TI7 season; ultimately leading to EGM being kicked on the last day of the \"Drop period\" before TI7 rosters had to be locked. They picked up Pablo as his replacement. After The International 2017, for which Alliance did not qualify, the team announced that they would part ways with its players Simon “Handsken” Haag, Linus “Limmp” Blomdin and Jonas “jonassomfan” Lindholm.\nOn April 10, 2023, the Alliance Cybersports organization announced on its official website that the Alliance.LATAM lineup playing in the South American DPC has left the organization.\n\"League of Legends\".\nThe Alliance \"League of Legends\" team formed in December 2013, and was granted the spot vacated by Evil Geniuses in the European League of Legends Championship Series due to Evil Geniuses moving to the North American LCS.\n2014.\nIn the Spring Split, Alliance finished 3rd in the regular season with a 16–12 record, behind SK Gaming and Fnatic. Alliance mid-laner Henrik “Froggen” Hansen was voted as the MVP of the Spring Split with 28% of the vote. In the playoffs, they finished 4th, losing to Fnatic in the semifinals 2–1, then lost to ROCCAT 2–0 in the 3rd place game.\nIn the Summer Split, Alliance topped the regular season standings with a 21–7 record. They then won the playoffs with a 3–1 over Fnatic in the finals, giving the team a spot in the 2014 League of Legends World Championship. At the World Championship, Alliance finished 3rd in their group, failing to advance to the knockout stage. The team was upset by Brazilian team KaBuM! e-Sports, which denied them a chance to play in a tiebreaker for a chance to progress to the knockout stage.\nAt Intel Extreme Masters San Jose, the team was eliminated by Cloud9.\nThe team picked up Martin \"Rekkles\" Larsson on 24 November 2014. After a Riot Games rules change concerning sponsorship, Alliance LoL left the organization and rebranded itself as Elements.\n2015.\nElements was created in January 2015 from the \"League of Legends\" roster of Alliance after rebranding itself due to a new sale of sponsorships rule established after the 2014 season. The initial starting roster of Elements included Wickd, Shook, Froggen, Rekkles, and Nyph.\nAfter a 4–4 record at the end of the fourth week of the spring split, Elements replaced Wickd with former Millenium top laner Kevin \"kev1n\" Rubiszewski. In the sixth week of the split they replaced Nyph with former Evil Geniuses support Krepo, who had previously played with Froggen on CLG.EU and EG. Nyph stayed in the team as an assistant coach. One week later, Wickd returned to the toplane position while kev1n became a sub. Nyph replaced Mart as the new head coach, joining the team during the picks and bans.\nElements went 7–11 in the EU Spring LCS regular season to finish 7th, failing to make the playoffs.\nRekkles left the team in April and was replaced at AD Carry by Erik “Tabzz” Van Helvert.\nElements changed four of the players on the roster for the Summer 2015 Split.\nIn early May 2016, German football club FC Schalke 04 bought Element's LCS spot."

The competition at these Games will comprise a total of 172 table tennis players coming from their respective NOCs; each may enter up to six athletes, two male and two female athletes in singles events and up to one men's and one women's team in team events. Host nation Brazil has automatically qualified six athletes; a team of three men and women with one each competing in the singles.\nThe top 22 male and top 22 female players on the International Table Tennis Federation's Olympic ranking list as of May 2016 will be qualified for the singles event at the Games. No nation can have more than two players per gender in the singles at these Games, so some players below the twenty-eighth position are given a qualifying place based on ranking.\nForty places will be awarded to the table tennis players with a maximum of two per NOC and gender through the following continental qualification tournaments between July 1, 2015 and April 24, 2016: six each from Africa and Latin America, eleven each from Asia and Europe, and three each from North America and Oceania. One invitational place per gender will be allocated by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).\nFor the team events, the highest-ranked NOC from each continent that already contains two qualified players for the singles adds a quota place to form a team of three players and thereby secures a direct qualifying place for the Games based on the ITTF Olympic Team Ranking list. The remaining ten teams are allotted to the nine highest-ranked NOCs in any continent and to the host nation Brazil (if not qualified by any means) that have two players qualified for the singles. If less than nine nations, the next best team with a single player secures a place for the Olympics.\nEvents.\n†: Athlete qualified for team event only."

        "text": "The \"Parade\" All-America Boys Basketball Team was an annual selection by \"Parade\" that nationally honored the top high school boys' basketball players in the United States. It was part of the \"Parade\" All-American series that originated with boys basketball before branching to other sports. Started by the Sunday magazine in 1957, it had been the longest ongoing selection of high school basketball All-Americans in the country at the time of its final selections in 2015. Many of the honorees went on to star as college and professional basketball players. As of March 2011, there were 162 \"Parade\" All-Americans that were playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nAt its onset, the selections were handled by a New York–based public relations firm, Publicity Enterprises, which was led by Haskell Cohen, who was a former sportswriter as well as the publicity director for the NBA at the time (1950–1969). The first All-America team in 1957 consisted of three five-player teams, and the first-team selections appeared on television on \"The Steve Allen Show\". The following year, 20 players were selected and participated in the first annual \"Parade\" All-American high school game. The list later expanded to 40 of the nation's top players, divided into four teams of 10 each. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known then as Lew Alcindor, became the first sophomore in 1963 to be named a \"Parade\" All-American. Fifteen years later, Earl Jones became the next sophomore to earn first-team honors, and subsequently joined Abdul-Jabbar as the first two players to be named to the first team on three occasions. \"It was a real thrill for me to make it on the \"Parade\" list early, when I was just a sophomore. The recognition is a great thing for kids to shoot for,\" said Abdul-Jabbar as part of the announcement for the 2000 team.\nStarting in 2011, the selections were compiled in conjunction with \"Sporting News\" and their writer, Brian McLaughlin. Candidates also began to be limited to players in their senior year. The selections went to a single-team format in 2012, and the size was reduced from 40- to a 20-player first team in 2014. McLaughlin described the selections as mostly Division I college-bound players that had a stellar senior year in high school. Additionally, \"Parade\" differentiated itself from most other All-American teams by not focusing solely on a player's standing among college recruiters. For example, some selectors might choose top recruits that had been injured much of their senior year. \"Parade\" discontinued its boys' basketball All-America selections after 2015."

He debuted for the Bulls in 2013.\nEarly years.\nDoyle was born in Birmingham and lived in the area his whole life, attending King's Norton Boys' School. It was during his time at King's Norton Sixth Form that he began a brief career at a local Sports Direct store.\nFootball career.\nDoyle debuted for the Birmingham Bulls in 2013, after attending rookie camp in late 2012. Although he originally arrived as a tight end, he quickly switched to wide receiver. After making a strong impression in camp, he was named as a starter for the opening game, away to the newly promoted West Coast Trojans, where he was the only Bulls receiver to complete a catch. The Bulls came away as 3-0 winners. Doyle received no further passes in a year where the Bulls struggled to a 2-8 finish.\nDoyle held onto his role as a starter going into 2014, despite a large rookie intake. As the season progressed, Doyle became known for difficult catches in tight windows, hauling in the ball in double coverage in a narrow defeat to the Lancashire Wolverines and securing the win over the Yorkshire Rams with a clutch catch in traffic on a vital third and long situation, allowing the Bulls to kneel out the rest of the clock.\nIn the very next game, against the Gateshead Senators, Doyle caught his first touchdown for the Bulls on a precise slant route. He made his longest reception weeks later against the Sheffield Predators, with a 35-yard catch and run.\nDuring the 2015 season, Doyle doubled his touchdown record, with a 47-yard reception against the Ouse Valley Eagles, and got his first rushing touchdown on an \"End-around\" play during the 50-0 victory over the Cambridgeshire Cats.\nCoaching.\nOn August 26th, Doyle was named as an assistant wide receivers coach by newly appointed offensive coordinator Gary Hodgen, to work under wide receiver coach Jon McNulty.

In 2011, it was announced that the competition would be expanded to include Argentina, which resulted in the competition being rebranded as The Rugby Championship and Argentina competed in the competition for the first time in 2012.\nThere was still no professional league in Argentina per rules of the Argentine Rugby Union.

This conclusion is drawn from an ancient relief that depicts athletes with clubs and ball. In modern era the cricket in Greece is connected with Corfu where this sport is pretty popular. The sport was imported to Corfu by the British when the Ionian Islands were under British rule (1815–64). The first teams in the island were created after the departure of the British, shortly after 1864. In 1893, the still existing club Kerkyraikos G.S. (Corfiot Athletic Club) was founded. Other cricket clubs were founded in subsequent years. In 1925 the club GSK Vyron was founded, and in 1976 the club AO Faiax was founded. The Hellenic Cricket Federation was founded in 1996.

        "text": "The Arizona State Sun Devils men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents Arizona State University. It plays its home games at Mullett Arena in Tempe.\nThe Sun Devils initially competed in the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). Since the 2015–16 season, it has competed as an independent in NCAA Division I—one of six active independent programs. Arizona State also maintains both WCHL Club Level teams with the WCHL D-1 Sun Devils, and the PAC-8 D-2 Sun Devils, respectively.\nHistory.\nHockey began as a sport at Arizona State in the fall of 1983 with ASU students gathering at Tower Ice Plaza in Central Phoenix to play pick up hockey amongst each other. As collegiate club hockey evolved throughout the country, so did hockey at Arizona State. By the late 80s ASU was fielding a full-fledged ice hockey team competing in Division II of the American Collegiate Hockey Association. In 1993, General Manager Mike Hoffarth led the program to achieving ACHA Division I status propelling the Sun Devil hockey program into the national spotlight by qualifying for the ACHA Division I National Tournament just two years later in the 1995–96 season. Then Head Coach, Gene Hammett would lead the program to three straight National Tournament appearances from 1995 to 1998.\nASU qualified for 10 ACHA Division I National Tournaments since competing at the Division I level in the American Collegiate Hockey Association, and developed 12 ACHA Division I All-Americans. In the 2013–14 season, the team won its first ACHA National Championship, defeating Robert Morris University-Illinois.\nOn November 18, 2014, Arizona State athletic director Ray Anderson announced that the Sun Devils would move to NCAA Division I ice hockey. The transition was funded by a $32 million donation by multiple parties (including former ASU hockey players). As a transitionary season, the Sun Devils played a split schedule between ACHA and NCAA games during the 2015–16 season, before migrating exclusively to NCAA play the following season. The Sun Devils were expected to begin as an independent, but pursue conference membership in the future.\nIn the 2018–19 season, Arizona State received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history, in only its third season as a Division I team. They were defeated by the Quinnipiac Bobcats in the regional semifinals.\nOn October 6, 2020, the Sun Devils announced that for logistical reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it would enter into an agreement to play all of its games as non-conference away games against Big Ten opponents, playing each of its seven hockey members four times in a 28-game season. This would assure the team a full season schedule, and avoid conflicts with the Coyotes at Gila River Arena due to the delay of the 2020-21 NHL season. The team still played as an independent, and were not eligible to qualify for the conference tournament.\nOn July 5, 2023, the Sun Devils announced that they will be joining the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) starting in the 2024-2025 season.\nPlayer hall of fame inductees\nSteve Hammett, Forward 1994–1998: Inducted 2009\nGreg Powers, Goaltender 1995–1999: Inducted 2009\nAdam Blossey, Defense 2001–2005: Inducted 2009\nTony Bonacorso, Defense 2004–2008, Inducted 2010\nIan Smith, Forward 1999–2003, Inducted 2010\nExecutive Hall of Fame Inductees\nGene Hammett, Head Coach 1992–2000: Inducted 2008\nMike Hoffarth, General Manager 1988–1999: Inducted 2008\nDon Mullet, Donor: Inducted 2008\nJohn Wold, Head Coach, General Manager, Oversight Committee 2001–present: Inducted 2009\nWayne Reid, Assistant Coach, Director of Hockey Ops, Oversight Committee 1992–present: Inducted 2009\nDoug Maire, Video Coach, Projects Manager Executive Hall of Fame Inducted 2013, Lifetime Service Award 2014\nNational Tournament Appearances\n1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98*, 2000–01*, 2003–2004, 2006–07, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–15\nFinal Four appearances: 2013, 2014, 2015\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nACHA Division I All-Americans\nSteve Hammett, Forward: 1997–98\nGreg Powers, Goaltender: 1996–97, 1997–98, 1998–99\nIan Smith, Forward: 2000–01, 2001–02 (Team USA, World University Games 2002)\nNils Satterstom, Forward: 2000–01\nAdam Blossey, Defense: 2003–04, 2004–05 (Team USA, World University Games 2005)\nTony Bonacorso, Defense: 2006–07, 2007–08 (Team USA, World University Games 2008)\nJoe Schweiger, Forward: 2008–09 (Eastern Michigan), 2009–10, 2010–11\nMark Schacker, Goaltender: 2010–11, 2011–12\nKale Dolinski, Forward: 2012–13\nColin Hekle, Forward: 2012–13\nRyan Clark, Defense: 2012–13\nJoe D’Elia, Goaltender: 2012–13\nArena.\nPrior to 2022, the Sun Devils played most of their home games at the Oceanside Ice Arena in Tempe.

        "title": "Lucha Libre World Cup (2015)",
        "text": "The Lucha Libre World Cup (2015) was a professional wrestling event and tournament organized by Mexican professional wrestling promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) with the financial backing of the Grupo Modelo brewery, with Victoria Beer as the official sponsor. The tournament included a number of three-man tag teams, referred to as \"trios\" in \"Lucha Libre\", two of which represented AAA itself, another team from outside AAA to represent Mexico as well as teams representing Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Lucha Underground, Ring of Honor (ROH), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah as well as an \"International team\". The tournament was originally announced as \"Copa Victoria\", but later rebranded as the \"Lucha Libre World Cup\".\nBackground.\nThe event featured eight professional wrestling matches, in which some wrestlers may have been involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others were matched up with no back story outside of the tournament. Wrestlers themselves portrayed either villains (referred to as \"\"Rudos\" in Mexico) or fan favorites (\"Tecnicos\"\" in Mexico) as they competed in matches with pre-determined outcomes. AAA originally announced that together with Grupo Modelo, specifically \"Victorian Beer\", to arrange \"Copa Victoria\", a trios tournament with teams from around the world competing in a one night tournament. At the time of the announcement AAA revealed that the first team to represent AAA would be the team of Alberto el Patron (team captain), Myzteziz and Rey Mysterio Jr. In late April it was announced that former AAA regular Kenzo Suzuki would captain a team representing All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) that would also include Tiger Mask III and Masamune. In addition former holder of the AAA World Tag Team Championship, Taiji Ishimori, would captain a team representing Pro Wrestling Noah consisting of himself, Yoshihiro Takayama and Atsushi Kotoge. It was also announced that Matt Hardy would captain the team representing the U.S. based Total Nonstop Action and Lucha Underground. The other two team members would be Mr. Anderson (TNA) and Johnny Mundo (LU). AAA also invited their rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to take part in the tournament, but they declined the offer. AAA announced that they would hold qualifiers to determine the second team representing AAA, with the winners of three qualifying matches earning the right to represent AAA. Fênix, Electroshock and El Hijo del Fantasma; La Parka, El Texano Jr. and Cibernético took place on April 30 with Psycho Clown, El Zorro and Averno to took place May 2. Winning their respective matches, El Hijo del Fantasma, El Texano Jr. Psycho Clown became members of the second AAA team. It has also been revealed that Blue Demon Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Solar would represent Mexico. The team called \"The Rest of the World\" would be represented by the Scottish Drew Galloway, Puerto Rican El Mesías and Angélico from South Africa.\nTournament rules.\nAAA vice president Dorian Roldán explained the rules in a video uploaded to AAA's official YouTube channel. The tournament would consist of trios matches structured in quarterfinals, semi-finals and a final, plus an extra match to determine the third place. The bouts are slated to have a 15-minute time limit. If the time limit is reached without a clear winner, each of the participating teams selects one member, and the two picked wrestlers face off in a 5-minute sudden death in which the winning wrestler gets the victory for his team. There will be as many sudden deaths as necessary to determine a victor.\nAftermath.\nAt the press conference after the show Rey Mysterio dedicated the victory to Perro Aguayo Jr. who had died a few weeks earlier after an accident during a match where he wrestled against Rey Mysterio. Following the event it was announced that Dr. Wagner Jr. had suffered a \"Second degree cervical sprain\" from the finish of the 3rd place match and would be unable to wrestle for 20 to 25 days. Dr. Wagner Jr. would wrestle the following Friday on a show in Tijuana.\nReception.\nApolo Valdés, who writes about lucha libre on the sports website \"MedioTiempo\" rated the show as an 8.5 out of 10, noting that while the winning team was predictable the matches were very entertaining. He also hope that some of the competitors would return to AAA at a future date, listing ACH, Drew Galloway, Masamune, Matt Hardy and Johnny Mundo as those he would like to see at future AAA events. Josh Boutwell, who writes a weekly Lucha column for wrestleview stated that the event had a very special atmosphere, making it feel like a SuperBowl level event for AAA. He cited the semi-final match between the Dream Team and Team ROH/LU as the best match of the night. His biggest complaints related to the feed, especially on the English language feed and gave the show itself an \"A\". Rob Barry of \"Voices of Wrestling\", which regularly covers Lucha Libre had a very different take on the show, calling it \"a new leader for worst show of the year\", citing the English commentary and the refereeing as particularly bad and that the show dragged on.\nAwards.\nAt final of the event, before the podium medals were given to its respective winners, there was given awards to some wrestlers. Judging panel gave \"Wrestler of the Night\" award to Rey Mysterio Jr., \"Dive of the Night\" award to Angélico, and \"Match of the Night\" award to bout contested between Dream Team and Team ROH/Lucha Underground."

        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines women's lacrosse team is the intercollegiate women's lacrosse program representing the University of Michigan. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wolverines play their home games in Ann Arbor, primarily at Michigan Stadium with the indoor Oosterbaan Field House as a secondary option. Women's lacrosse was established as a varsity sport in 2014, and the team played in the American Lacrosse Conference during its inaugural season before joining the Big Ten in 2015. The team is currently coached by Hannah Nielsen.\nHistory.\nPrior to the establishment of its varsity program, women's lacrosse was a club sport at the University of Michigan. In 2011, the club team compiled a record of 15–6 under the direction of head coach Jen Dunbar. On May 25, 2011, Michigan officially promoted its women's lacrosse team to varsity status, the same day that the school's varsity men's program was announced. Unlike the men's team, the women's team was not originally scheduled to begin play until 2013. In May 2011, the most pressing priorities for the new women's program were the search for its first head coach and its application for membership in the American Lacrosse Conference, which counted among its members other Big Ten schools such as Northwestern, Ohio State, and Penn State, as well as more distant institutions such as Florida, Johns Hopkins, and Vanderbilt.\nIn 2014, Michigan played its inaugural varsity season as a member of the American Lacrosse Conference under head coach Jennifer Ulehla. Prior to being named head coach on September 8, 2011, Uleha had been an assistant coach at Florida and with the U.S. National Elite Team as well as an assistant coach at Temple and James Madison. The program's first official varsity game was at Villanova on February 22, while its home opener was against Marquette on February 28 at Oosterbaan Field House. On June 3, 2013, the Big Ten Conference announced that it would begin sponsoring women's lacrosse in 2015; together with men's lacrosse, which would debut the same season, they would respectively be the conference's 27th and 28th official sports. Alongside Michigan, the five other teams competing in the new conference included Maryland, Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, and Rutgers. As of 2015, head coach Uleha's coaching staff consists of assistant coaches Becca Block and Alyssa Murray.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Michigan's season results as an NCAA Division I program:\n†NCAA cancelled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nStadium.\nMichigan plays its home games at both Michigan Stadium and Oosterbaan Field House. For both the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the team scheduled its first two games of the year at Oosterbaan, and then played the remainder of its home schedule (six games, in both cases) at Michigan Stadium. Oosterbaan Field House, which was built in 1970, has a total capacity of 1,000 and a FieldTurf playing surface. Michigan Stadium boasts a capacity of 107,601 and was built for the Michigan football team in 1927; however, it did not host a varsity lacrosse game until 2012, when the Michigan men's lacrosse program played its first game there. The women's team played its first game at Michigan Stadium on March 20, 2014, losing to Winthrop, 14–12."

        "text": "The men's épée competition in fencing at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was held on 9 August at the Carioca Arena 3. There were 38 competitors from 20 nations. South Korea's Park Sang-young won the individual gold, the first victory for South Korea in the event after bronze medals in 2000 and 2012. Géza Imre took silver, Hungary's first medal in the event since 1996. Imre, at age 41, was the oldest individual fencing medalist since 1952. Gauthier Grumier of France earned bronze.\nIn the final, Imre led 14-10 before Park scored the final 5 points to win 15–14.\nBackground.\nThis was the 27th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFive of the eight quarterfinalists from 2012 returned: gold medalist Rubén Limardo of Venezuela, bronze medalist Jung Jin-Sun of South Korea, fifth-place finisher Paolo Pizzo of Italy, sixth-place finisher Silvio Fernández of Venezuela, and seventh-place finisher Yannick Borel of France. Géza Imre of Hungary was the reigning (2015) World Champion; other World Champions competing in the event were Nikolai Novosjolov (2010 and 2013), Anton Avdeev (2009) and Pizzo (2011). France's Gauthier Grumier was the top seed in the tournament.\nNo nations made their debut in the event, though one Kuwaiti athlete competed as an Independent Olympic Athlete. France and the United States each appeared for the 25th time, tied for most among nations.\nQualification.\nNations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Men's épée was the second event this applied to, so each nation could enter a maximum of two fencers in the event in 2012. The team épée was back in 2016 (sabre the missing weapon for men), so the limit was three for 2016.\nThere were 35 dedicated quota spots for men's épée. The first 24 spots went to the 3 members of each of the 8 qualified teams in the team foil event. Next, 7 more men were selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 from Europe, 2 from the Americas, 2 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa. Finally, 4 spots were allocated by continental qualifying events: 1 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 1 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa.\nAdditionally, there were 8 host/invitational spots that could be spread throughout the various fencing events. Brazil used 3 of those places in the men's épée, resulting in a total of 38 competitors.\nCompetition format.\nThe épée competition, following the format introduced in 1996, consisted of a six-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers. Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout."

The medals were presented by Paul Tergat, IOC member, Kenya and Donald Anthony Jr., Executive Board Member of FIE. There were 35 competitors from 19 nations. The event was won by Daniele Garozzo of Italy, the nation's ninth victory in the men's foil (matching France for most all-time) and first since 1996. The silver medalist was American Alexander Massialas, earning the United States' first medal in the event since 1960. Timur Safin of Russia took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 27th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Five of the eight quarterfinalists from 2012 returned: gold medalist Lei Sheng of China, silver medalist Alaaeldin Abouelkassem of Egypt, fifth-place finisher Andrea Cassarà of Italy, seventh-place finisher Ma Jianfei of China, and eighth-place finisher Aleksey Cheremisinov of Russia. 2008 silver medalist, 2012 top-16 finisher, and reigning world champion Yuki Ota of Japan also returned. Cheremisinov had been world champion in 2014, while American Miles Chamley-Watson had taken the title in 2013. The top-ranked fencer going into the Games was another American, Alexander Massialas.\nThe Czech Republic made its debut in the men's foil. France and the United States each made their 25th appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nQualification.\nNations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two.

Brazil had already qualified a men's foil team (with the corresponding three places in individual foil), so used no spots in the individual men's foil.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2016 tournament continued to use that format. Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout. Standard foil rules regarding target area, striking, and priority were used."

The event was won by Áron Szilágyi of Hungary, the fourth man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the sabre and 14th to win multiple medals of any color. It was Hungary's 14th gold medal in the event, half of all possible. Daryl Homer earned the United States' first medal in the event since 1984 with his silver, while Kim Jung-hwan took South Korea's first individual men's sabre medal ever with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 28th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics.

Russia had three different fencers win the three world championships since the 2012 Games: Veniamin Reshetnikov in 2013, Nikolay Kovalev in 2014, and Aleksey Yakimenko in 2015; with the national limit reduced to two fencers for the 2016 sabre competition, only Kovalev and Yakimenko entered the event.

The first 14 spots went to the top ranked individual fencers in the world rankings (adjusted to allow only two per nation). Next, 8 more men were selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 each from Europe, the Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Africa. Each nation could only earn one spot from this continental ranking, but this could be added to a world ranking place (for a total of two).

Only nations without any fencers already qualified could enter these events, and only one fencer per nation could\nAdditionally, there were 8 host/invitational spots that could be spread throughout the various fencing events.

Qualification was primarily based on the FIE Official Ranking as of April 4, 2016, with further individual places available at 4 zonal qualifying tournaments.\nFor the team events, 8 teams qualified in each event. Each team must be composed of 3 fencers. The top 4 ranked teams qualified. The next best ranked team from each zone (Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Oceania) qualified as long as it was ranked in the top 16. If a zone had no teams ranked between 5th and 16th, the best placed nation not already qualified would be selected regardless of zone.\nFor individual events with corresponding team events, the 3 fencers from the team event qualified for individual competition automatically. 7 more places were awarded based on the rankings (ignoring fencers from countries with team qualifications and considering only the top fencer from each country): the top 2 fencers from each of Europe, Asia-Oceania, and the Americas, and the top 1 fencer from Africa, qualified. 4 more places (1 per zone) were awarded through zone qualifying tournaments; only countries without a qualified fencer in an event were eligible to participate in these zone qualifying tournaments.\nFor individual events without corresponding team events, the top 14 fencers in the rankings (adjusted to include only the top 2 fencers per country) qualified. The next 2 best ranked fencers from each zone (but from different countries) also qualified. 10 spots were allocated through zone qualifying tournaments (4 for Europe, 3 for Asia-Oceania, 2 for the Americas, and 1 for Africa); only countries without a qualified fencer in an event were eligible to participate in these zone qualifying tournaments and each country could send only 1 fencer.\nThe host country was guaranteed a minimum of 8 quota spots."

The top two teams at the end of the round robin stage qualify for the final. The winner of the final is declared the champion.\nIn the 2015 season, the league has terminated the \"last set importance\" which gave the trailing team an opportunity to continue playing if they win the fifth set as played out in the 2014 season. In the 2015 season, the fifth set continues in the conventional way, where the first team to score 6 games wins the set, with a 13-point tie-breaker to decide the winner, if the two teams are tied at 5–5.\nIf the two teams are tied (in terms of games won) at the end of the five Sets, a super shoot-out is played in a men's singles format to determine the winner of the match. It is played as a 19-point super tiebreaker. The first team to win 10 points, 9–9 final point wins the Super Shoot-Out and hence the Match. A 2-point difference is not required, and it is not time bound (unlike the 2014 season). The match-winner is the team that wins the most games and hence points, at the end of the five sets.\nThe league standings are determined on the basis of the win–loss percentage of overall games won versus lost therefore making every game played count. The two teams with the best percentage ratios qualify for the finals. In the event that two teams are tied for the second place, the following criteria determines which team qualifies for the finals:\nTeams.\nFive teams will compete in the 2015 IPTL season.

Next year is an Olympic year, so I don’t see us adding another team, but we’ll continue building on from here.”\nWhat the Players said:\nStan Wawrinka: “Do not be fooled: everybody knows why we play this event.\"\nMarcelo Melo: “Stan asked to play with me, which was great. He’s such a great player. I think he helped me more today than I helped him! It was great to have him as my doubles partner today!”\nNick Kyrgios: “Last year we had some good players but I don't think we had the same chemistry as a team, to be honest. We all got along pretty well from day one. Our energy on the bench was great and when we lost we supported each other and came back each day and gave our best. Every game counts so that was key. My team as a whole worked a lot better together this year.” He added, “For me this is a massive opportunity to be in the same team with Stan - Grand Slam Champion, Marcelo - number one doubles player in the world, Carlos - one of the greatest players to have ever played. For me sitting on the bench its massive watching them and seeing how they train. The relationships I now have. That's priceless!”\nDustin Brown: “It's been great. I watched IPTL last year on my TV so to be part of it this year it’s been great. Ii was very happy when I got the call after Wimbledon. Our team bonded really well and to be on personal terms with guys I used to only see on TV or play on the Play Station, is fantastic. It's great to be able to call these guys and ask for help. We have a really good chemistry on and off the court and that definitely made the difference in us getting the win today.”\nBelinda Bencic: “I had a great year and I am very happy to have been in this position. It really helps me with next year and my preparations. I am really looking forward to 2016 and I'd like to be back for the IPTL.”"

        "text": "Jon Harris is an American college basketball coach who is the former men's head coach at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE), an NCAA Division I program competing in the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). A high school star at Edwardsville High School, Harris played collegiately at Marquette University. He was named the SIUE Cougars' new coach in April 2015 after spending thirteen years as an assistant in five different Division I programs. On March 11, 2019, SIUE announced that Harris' contract had not been renewed.\nHarris is currently (Fall 2019) a Recruiting Specialist for Next College Student Athlete, a company that facilitates the contacting of college coaches by high school and middle school students.\nBiography.\nJon Harris was born in Edwardsville, Illinois in 1981, the son of Robert \"Bob\" and Mary Ann Harris. He followed in his father's footsteps by starring in basketball at Edwardsville High School (EHS), remaining in town with an aunt when his father's employment was transferred to Chicago. Harris was the 1998 \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" Player of the Year, a \"USA Today\" honorable mention All-American, and an Associated Press (AP) All-State selection. This was despite the team's failure to advance beyond the sectional semifinals in the IHSA state tournament— as a junior, the EHS Tigers lost to Alton in a six overtime game; as a senior, the Tigers fell to Collinsville on a 70-foot \"buzzer-beater\" with both games played at SIUE's Vadalabene Center.\nAfter graduating from EHS, Harris attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, in his sophomore through senior seasons, coached by Tom Crean. Although he started only 22 games, he had major playing time in every game under Crean, and was team captain as a junior and senior. He finished his playing career ranked #20 on the Conference USA rebounding list and was a career 53% shooter from the floor. Teamed with Dwyane Wade, Harris' 2001–02 Golden Eagles team went 26–7, finishing in the NCAA Tournament and earning a #9 AP ranking. The Golden Eagles fell victim to one of the notorious 12 vs. 5 upsets to Tulsa (one of three that year).\nHarris graduated from Marquette in 2002 with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He is married to the former Heidi Bowman, who was also a four-year basketball star at Marquette, earning Conference USA All-Conference honors in 2001. They have three children, Hailey, Leah, and Jaxon.\nCoaching career.\nHarris began his coaching career immediately after graduation, joining Tom Crean's staff as graduate assistant; that 2002–03 team, led by future NBA All-Star Dwyane Wade, built a record of 27–6 on the way to the Final Four. Following that first season at Marquette, Harris moved to the staff of Tod Kowalczyk at Green Bay, becoming, at age 22, the youngest full-time assistant coach in the country. In his five seasons at Green Bay, Harris was instrumental in developing eight All-Horizon League players, and while recruiting Indiana for Green Bay, he got to know then-Purdue assistant Cuonzo Martin. When Martin was named the head coach at Missouri State, he quickly hired Harris as one of his first assistants. The Bears improved from 11 wins in 2008–09 to 24–12 and the CIT championship in 2009–10, and to 26–9 with the school's first Missouri Valley Conference regular season title and the second round of the NIT the following season. When Martin moved on to Tennessee, Harris was his first assistant hired. After seasons of 19–15, 20–13, and 24–13, Martin took the coaching job at California, and Harris followed, but he stayed only one season in Berkeley before returning home for the SIUE job.\nAfter four seasons with a record that was worse than the previous four years, on March 11, 2019, SIUE announced that Harris's contract had not been renewed after a four-year record of 31 and 88 losses. However, Harris's full staff of assistant coaches Brian Barone, Charles \"Bubba\" Wells, and Mike Waldo and Director of Operations Casey Wyllie were all retained, and Barone was later named as interim head coach."

        "title": "List of international cricket five-wicket hauls at the Riverside Ground",
        "text": "The Riverside Ground is a cricket ground in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. It is the home of Durham County Cricket Club and has hosted Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. It has a capacity of 17,000 spectators for international matches, for which temporary stands are erected. The Riverside hosted six Test matches between 2003, when England played Zimbabwe, and 2016. It hosted its first ODI in 1999 when Pakistan defeated Scotland by 94 runs in the qualifying round of that year's Cricket World Cup, and T20Is have been played at the ground since 2008. Women's ODI and T20I matches have also been played on the ground.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Test match at the Riverside Ground was Richard Johnson in 2003 who, making his Test debut for England against Zimbabwe, finished with bowling figures of 6 wickets for 33 runs. These remained the best Test bowling figures at the Riverside until 2013 when Australia's Ryan Harris took 7 wickets for 117 runs in the fourth Test against England. Stuart Broad is the only bowler to have taken two five-wicket hauls in Test matches at the ground, doing so in the same Test match, also making him the only bowler to have taken ten wickets in an international match at the Riverside. , nine bowlers have taken ten Test match five-wicket hauls at the ground; every Test match in which a five-wicket haul has been taken at the Riverside Ground has resulted in an England victory.\nAs of August 2015, two bowlers have taken five-wicket hauls during ODIs at the Riverside. New Zealand's medium pace bowler James Franklin took 5 wickets for 42 runs against England during their tour in 2004 and England's Graeme Swann achieved 5 for 28 against Australia in the final ODI of the 2009 NatWest Series. No five-wicket hauls have been taken in T20I cricket or in Women's international matches on the ground.\nTests.\nA total of 11 five-wicket hauls were taken in the six Test matches played on the ground.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nTwo five-wicket hauls have been taken in ODIs on the ground."

        "title": "Artistic gymnastics in the United States",
        "text": "Artistic gymnastics is a type of gymnastics in which athletes compete with short routines on various equipment, including bars, beams, rings, pommel horses, vaulting tables, and on a sprung floor. Gymnastics is well-established in the United States, where available programs range from recreational classes, casual summer camps, and children's leagues; to highly competitive collegiate leagues and four national teams (a junior and senior men's team and a junior and senior women's team). Although this is not unique to the United States, due to the physically demanding nature of the sport there are fewer options for adult gymnastics outside the elite level, although local parks and recreation departments often have limited offerings.\nOrganization.\nUSA Gymnastics is the national governing body for several gymnastics disciplines in the United States: artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, trampolining, tumbling, acrobatic gymnastics, \"Gymnastics for All\", and parkour). Since its establishment in 1963, USAG has been responsible for selecting national teams, providing training facilities, encouraging participation and building a strong gymnastics program that involves all types of athletes. USA Gymnastics is a member of the continental \"Pan American Gymnastics Union\", referred to as \"PAGU\" and is also part of the international governing body for gymnastics, International Federation of Gymnastics.\nElite program.\nThe international elite level is the highest level one can reach in USA Gymnastics for artistic gymnastics, permitting gymnasts to compete in domestic elite competitions, be recruited to U.S. national teams and represent the United States at the World Championships and the Olympic Games. It is estimated that a competitive gymnast's chances of reaching this level are 1-5%. To qualify for elite status, there are various criteria a gymnast must meet. As of 2015, first-year elite trialists must score 51.500 (Junior) or 53.000 (Senior) in the 2015 National Elite Qualifier event to gain international elite status. For returning elite participants, gymnasts must have competed at the previous year's U.S. Nationals. To qualify for the 2015 U.S. Nationals, there are no automatic qualifiers for Juniors and qualification spots are decided from 2014 scores or results from 2015 Classic. For seniors, they receive automatic qualification if they represented the U.S. during the season or at the 2014 World Championships. In the men's program, gymnasts qualify to the National Championships through a National Qualifier event.\nUSA Gymnastics at the Olympics.\nCurrently, the United States is ranked second in the medal table for artistic gymnastics, behind the Soviet Union. The United States is ranked first in the medal table for currently active NOCs, and first for all NOCs in the women's gymnastics.\nNational teams.\nUSA Gymnastics has four national teams; Two for women (Junior and Senior) and two for men (Junior and Senior). The national team represents the U.S. in international competitions such as the Olympic Games, Pan American Games and World Championships. USA Gymnastics typically funds around 12-16 National team spots for seniors and 6-8 for juniors but places can be awarded based on need. The men's U.S. National Team has a Senior team and its Junior team is divided into two age groups; 15-16 and 17-18.\nCollege gymnastics.\nCollege gymnastics is an ever-growing sport in the United States. All of the college gymnastics is governed by the NCAA, excluding club gymnastics, which is headed by the NAIGC (National Association of International Collegiate Clubs). College gymnastics is a select college program with only 84 schools sponsoring it, throughout the three athletic divisions. In women's gymnastics, there are 82 schools sponsoring the sport, throughout Divisions I, II and III. Conversely, in men's gymnastics, only 16 schools sponsor an NCAA men's gymnastics team; all of which are in I, excluding Springfield College which is in Division III. There are many club teams for men's gymnastics, however. This is largely due to the fact that schools run out of money to fund the program and therefore it is cut from the school's program. An excellent example of this would be the Temple Owls team, who cut the program following the 2014 season, due to reasons such as \"title IX, student welfare and facility needs\".\n Title IX has been a factor in the abolition of a few gymnastics programs; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and James Madison University both cut their women's gymnastics programs in the 2000s, as did Cal State Fullerton, just after the 2010-11 season, due to \"budget constraints\". Although many programs have folded in recent years, some have opened. Notably, Lindenwood University added their gymnastics program for the 2012-13 season and were the first school in 10 years to add a gymnastics program, since University of Arkansas added their program in 2001.\nCollege gymnastics is a head count sport therefore, meaning that the NCAA limits the total number of individuals that can receive athletic scholarships but allows an individual to receive up to a full ride scholarship. For women's gymnastics, it is 12 for DI and 6 for DII and for men's gymnastics, it is 6.3. No financial aid is award for DIII teams, like all NCAA sports. Gymnastics scholarships are fiercely competitive with many high school gymnasts wanting full-ride scholarships to top schools. Typically, women's gymnasts will need to be at least Level 10 to make a DI team but it is common to find Elite-level gymnasts, the top level of gymnastics, too. For DII scholarships, coaches would prefer a Level 10 gymnast but it is not unusual to find Level 9s earning full-ride scholarships to schools of this division. In DIII, Level 9s or Level 8s will probably compete for these teams, not on scholarships though. For top schools, such as the University of Florida, the University of Alabama and the University of Oklahoma, their rosters are likely to be filled with former elites, possibly even Olympians and National Team members, and strong Level 10 gymnasts. These teams have the luxury to be selective with recruiting because many talented gymnasts approach them, instead of vice versa. In 2014, it was estimated that there were 19,000 female high school gymnasts and 1,733 college gymnasts in the country; making the chances of a high school gymnast earning a college scholarship around 9.0%. In men's gymnastics, most of the DI teams look for Level 10s and Elites, too. Unlike women's gymnastics, there are less male high school gymnasts wanting scholarships increasing the chances of earning a college scholarship to 19.1%. \nAnother factor added to the contest to earn a college scholarship in gymnastics is the, which has only recently started to occur, interest in college gymnastics from international gymnasts. In previous years, college gymnastics has seen gymnasts from Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Mexico. Typically, international recruits will be former Olympians, such as Marissa King, Brittany Rogers and Olivia Vivian. The most 'culturally diverse' women's gymnastics programs could be known to be teams such as UCLA Bruins, Oregon State Beavers, Florida Gators and LSU Tigers; all of whom have had 2+ international team members every year since 2010. Generally, not as many international gymnasts compete in men's gymnastics, but there is still a handful of international collegiate gymnasts.\nDuring the regular season, teams will compete in dual meets against other schools. Typically, but not exclusively, teams will choose their schedule/opponent based on if they are in the same conference as one another. Most school's gymnastics programs compete in indoor arenas with a capacity of around 5,000-15,000; often shared with the school's basketball team. The Utah Red Rocks have the highest average home attendance and have done for several years, averaging 14,858.33 spectators during the 2015 season. Most programs have a schedule of around 10-12 meets during the regular season, competing every week. Once the regular season concludes, teams prepare for their Conference Championships. Based on performances at the Conference championships, teams advance to NCAA Regionals and are seeded accordingly. To qualify for regionals, the NCAA uses a specially formulated method called the Regional Qualifying Score (RQS). This formula is used for teams and individuals, calculated by a teams's/individual's best six regular season scores, three of which must be away, then the highest score is eliminated and the remaining five scores are averaged. At Regionals, of which there are six hosted in the nation, the top two teams and top two all-rounders, who are not on a qualifying team, advance to Nationals. Alternatively, if a gymnast, who is not on a qualifying team, wins an individual event (i.e. Bars), she will receive an automatic berth to Nationals, just to compete on that single event. The final event of the season is the National Championships. In the semifinals, the 12 teams are split into 2 sessions. The top 3 teams in each session advance to the Team Finals, also called the 'Super Six'. Also, there are event finals for the top gymnasts on each event. The men's format differs slightly.\nCollege gymnastics receives adequate television coverage with programming contracts from SEC Network, Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network, who often broadcast meets during the regular season. However, some Pac-12 Conference coaches, including Greg Marsden and Chris Waller, have been demanding more television coverage for women's collegiate gymnastics.\nClub gymnastics.\nCurrently, there are around 86,800 athletes enrolled in artistic gymnastics disciplines in the United States. This figure makes up just under 85% of the total number of athletes enrolled in any gymnastics discipline in USA Gymnastics; clearly showing that artistic gymnastics is the most popular gymnastics discipline in the country.\nJunior Olympic program.\nIn both, the men's and women's artistic programs, the main program is the Junior Olympic program. For women, there are ten levels ranging from Level 1 to Level 10. Levels 1-3 are developmental levels and are for young athletes. Levels 4-5 are compulsory levels which cannot be skipped, and contain harder skills, which are set, and from Level 6 onwards; is the optional levels. In optionals, gymnasts can choose the routines they do instead of being given them. The men's J.O. program differs slightly. Levels 1-3 are part of the Essential Elements program. Levels 4-7 are compulsory levels and from Level 8 onwards, gymnasts compete in optionals. In the women's program, there is also the Xcel program. This gives gymnasts to give competitive gymnastics a try but not to compete in levels.\nThe J.O. program competitive season usually lasts from December–April; with the J.O. Nationals held in May. Teams travel to invitationals to compete against other clubs and to win medals and get experience. Also, it is not uncommon for college recruiters to be at the bigger meets so that is another incentive and also, top teams win prize money at many events. USA Gymnastics sanctions over 4,000 invitationals during the year. \nIn the Women's Artistic Junior Olympic program, a televised Level 10 event called the Nastia Liukin Cup takes place every March; and has done since 2010. The event is named after 2008 Olympian, Nastia Liukin and is held in conjunction with the AT&amp;T American Cup; taking place the Friday night before. To earn a qualification berth to the Nastia Liukin Cup, gymnasts compete in selected invitationals during the season and the top gymnasts in the Junior and Senior divisions compete at the Cup. Since 2014, there has been a separate competition for both age divisions. In the past, various U.S. National Team members have come from the competition; including 2012 Olympic Champion, Gabby Douglas, who came 4th in the inaugural 2010 competition.\nJ.O. Nationals is an important event in the Junior Olympic Women's Artistic calendar and is the final event of the season. At Nationals, there are eight age divisions; ranging from Junior A-D and Senior A-D and gymnasts are allotted into these categories depending on their birth date. To qualify to Nationals, a gymnast must place in the Top 7 in the all-around at Regionals in her age division. Additionally, gymnasts who placed 8th and 9th are the reserves but compete in the J.O. National Invitational Tournament; a competition that is held at Nationals but isn't as big as Nationals. This competition still gives the gymnasts experience and often, gymnasts who didn't have a good performance at Regionals can find redemption competing at this event."

Their head coach was Chris Holtmann, serving his second year. The Bulldogs played their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 9,100. This was Butler's third season in the Big East Conference. They finished the season 22–11, 10–8 in Big East play to finish in a tie for fourth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament to Providence.

Butler received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed and defeated Texas in the second round before losing in the Third Round to Notre Dame.\nOff season.\nWith starting point guard Alex Barlow graduating in May 2015, Butler needed to add some depth in the guard position to back up Kellen Dunham and Tyler Lewis, who will be coming off of a redshirt season in 2014–15 due to transfer rules. On March 29, 2015, Jordan Gathers, a 6'3\" combo guard from St. Bonaventure in the Atlantic 10 Conference announced his commitment to Butler after sitting out a season due to a hip injury. Barely a week and a half later, Butler gained another transfer from the Atlantic 10, this time in Kethan Savage from George Washington University. Savage, a 6'3\" guard, will have to sit out a year per NCAA transfer regulations and will be available for the 2016–17 season. Gathers completed his degree at St. Bonaventure in three and a half years and therefore is immediately eligible to play.\nThere were also some changes in the coaching staff in the off season. On April 27, Butler announced the hire of Ryan Pedon, former assistant to Illinois head coach (and former Butler assistant) John Groce, as an assistant coach. Emerson Kampen, who was promoted to an assistant coaching position following Chris Holtmann's appointment as interim HC, was named Butler's new basketball analyst for the 2014-15 season.\nAnother major change occurred in August when it was announced that the playing surface in Hinkle Fieldhouse — the oldest playing surface still in use in the NCAA — was being sanded down to prepare for the new Bulldog logo at center court. The new design does not include the word \"Butler\" underneath the bulldog, and replaces the word \"Bulldogs\" on both end lines with \"Butler.\" Also, the home sideline will have \"Hinkle Fieldhouse\" painted on it.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#11284B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#11284B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#11284B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East Conference Play\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#11284B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#11284B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament"

The Spartans, led by 21st-year head coach Tom Izzo, played their home games at the Breslin Center and were members of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 29–6, 13–5 in Big Ten play to finish in second place. They defeated Ohio State, Maryland, and Purdue to win the Big Ten tournament. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, their 19th straight NCAA tournament appearance. As the No. 2 seed in the Midwest region, they were upset by No. 15 seed Middle Tennessee in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NCAA tournament history.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2014–15 season 27–12, 12–6 in Big Ten play to finish in third place. They received an at-large bid as the No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 18th straight trip to the tournament. The Spartans advanced to the Final Four, their seventh trip to the Final Four under Tom Izzo, before losing to eventual National Champion, Duke.\nOffseason.\nThe Spartans lost Branden Dawson (11.9 points and 9.1 rebounds per game) to the NBA draft and Travis Trice (15.3 points and 5.1 assist per game) to graduation following the season.\nRecruiting class.\nThe Spartans 2015 recruiting class was ranked 18th in the nation. Leading the class was the No. 22 overall recruit, Deyonta Davis.\nPreseason.\nFor the first time since 1991 and for the first time in Tom Izzo's tenure as head coach at Michigan State, Michigan State made a preseason trip abroad. Beginning August 22, 2015, they traveled to Italy for 11 days for sightseeing and four games against international teams. The first of the four games was a win against a newer Italian professional club team. They followed up this game with games against the Russian, Italian, and Georgian National Teams on consecutive nights. Michigan State finished the trip 1–3 with a win over the club team and losses to the national teams. Despite the losses, head coach Tom Izzo stated, “This trip was as good as anything I’ve done in my 20 years.” The high points from the trip were Gavin Schilling's performance (17 points each in the final two games) and Denzel Valentine who scored in double figures in all but the last game. Eron Harris and Alvin Ellis III were allowed to travel with the team, but were not allowed to play due to their preseason legal issues.\nPrior to the season beginning in November, the Spartans were ranked No. 13 in the preseason AP and Coaches Polls.\nExhibition games.\nThe Spartans defeated Northern Michigan 94–53 in their first exhibition game on November 4, 2015. Bryn Forbes led all scorers with 23 points and Denzel Valentine notched a triple double with 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Though the Spartans only led 38–33 at the half, they pulled away in the second for an easy victory.\nIn the final exhibition game on November 9, the Spartans rolled over Ferris State 93–57. Forbes again led all scorers with 16 points and Valentine added 15 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists. Freshman guard Matt McQuaid added nine points and eight assists.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference regular season.\nNovember.\nThe Spartans began their season at home against Florida Atlantic on November 17, 2015. The Spartans won easily as Matt Costello led the way with 15 points. Denzel Valentine added 13 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. Freshman Deyonta Davis also added 13 points as MSU won the game 82–55.\nThe Spartans next game was part of the Champions Classic in Chicago, Illinois, playing the No. 3-ranked team in the country, Kansas, on November 18. The Champions Classic, an event that features four premier college programs: Duke, Kentucky, Kansas, and Michigan State, is an annual event where the four teams alternate playing each other. In this match-up of two major college programs, Denzel Valentine led the Spartans's from an 11-point deficit in the second half to an upset of Kansas with a triple double, scoring 29 points with 12 rebounds and 12 assists. It was only the 13th triple double in Spartan history and Valentine's first. Bryn Forbes added 13 points and freshman Matt McQuaid added 9 points on three of three shooting from behind the arc. MSU pulled out the win, 79–73 win.\nMSU followed this impressive neutral court win with a home court rout of Arkansas–Pine Bluff, 92–46, on November 20. Javon Bess led the Spartans with 16 points while Valentine chipped in 11 assists. On November 23, as the Spartans moved up to No. 3 in boll polls, they routed Eastern Michigan, 89–65. Davis led Spartan scorers with 16 points, while Costello notched 10 rebounds, and Valentine dished out seven assists.\nThe Spartans then traveled to Fullerton, California, to participate in the DirecTV Wooden Legacy. In the first game of the tournament on Thanksgiving, a blowout of Boston College, Valentine repeated his performance against Kansas, notching a triple double again (29 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists). The win marked Tom Izzo's 500th career win, all with Michigan State. The semifinals of the Wooden Legacy saw the Spartans facing Boise State on November 27 for a chance to play in the championship game. The Spartans prevailed again for their sixth straight win to open the season. Valentine scored a career-high 32 points with nine rebounds and six assists as the Spartans won 77–67. In the championship game held in the Honda Center, in Anaheim, California, on November 29, the Spartans faced Providence, led by player of the year candidate, Kris Dunn. Former Spartans Magic Johnson and Branden Dawson were in attendance, as was Chris Paul. Bryn Forbes led the Spartans with 18 points. Valentine added 17 as MSU outlasted Providence 77–64. The Spartans finished the month of November 7–0.\nDecember.\nOn December 2, the Wooden Award Watch List was released listing the top 50 players to be considered for the player of the year. Denzel Valentine was included on the list.\nThe Spartans returned home to open December by facing No. 24 ranked Louisville in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge on December 2. Louisville mixed defenses, going from man-to-man to zone, sometimes in the same possession, to take an early lead against MSU. The Spartans again rallied from behind, led by Valentine and Forbes, to beat Louisville 71–67. Forbes totaled 20 points while Valentine had 25. Following the win over Louisville and losses by No. 2 Maryland and No. 1 North Carolina, MSU hosted Binghamton with a chance to claim the No. 1 ranking in both polls. The Spartans demolished Binghamton 76–33. The Spartans held Binghamton to 12 points in the first half and started the game with an impressive display of passing which led to a dunk by Valentine. Valentine himself outscored Binghamton in the first half 13–12. At 9–0, the Spartans were off to their second best start in school history with the No. 1 ranking on the way. When the polls were released on December 7, the Spartans were ranked No. 1 in both polls for only the fourth time in school history.\nAs the newly minted No. 1 team, the Spartans continued their impressive start by routing Maryland–Eastern Shore, 78–35 on December 9 in East Lansing. On December 12, Florida traveled to East Lansing to face the Spartans. Michigan State took advantage of the match-up to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their 2000 National Championship which they had won against Florida. The Spartans encountered stiff competition from Florida, but prevailed again, winning 58–52, their lowest scoring output of the season. Valentine again led the way for the Spartans, totaling 17 points. The school also celebrated the Big Ten champion football team at half time. They followed the victory with a rout of Northeastern a week later. The win made the Spartans 12–0, matching the best start in school history.\nOn December 20, Denzel Valentine suffered a knee injury in practice. The injury required surgery to repair torn cartilage the next day and Valentine was expected to miss two to three weeks of games, likely missing games against Oakland, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and, perhaps, Penn State. Though characterized as minor, the injury was expected to have a great effect on the Spartans as Valentine led the team in scoring, rebounds, and assists. Eron Harris would replace Valentine in the starting lineup and be counted on to step up his production in Valentine's absence. Two days later, the Spartans faced Oakland in Auburn Hills. The Spartans trailed Oakland by as many as 15 and trailed by 13 at the half. The Spartans rallied in the second half to take the lead, but were forced to go to overtime to get the win, outlasting Oakland 99–93. Bryn Forbes led the way for the Spartans without Valentine, scoring 32 points and Eron Harris added 27. The win set the record for best start to a season for Michigan State at 13–0 and marked an undefeated non-conference schedule.\nOn December 28, Tom Izzo's father, Carl, died at the age of 90. Carl and Izzo's mother, Dorothy, were common faces around the Michigan State program. They each accompanied him on NCAA tournament trips over the years.\nBig Ten regular season.\nDecember.\nThe Spartans started the Big Ten regular season still without Valentine on December 29 by visiting Iowa. Iowa controlled the game from the start, limiting Forbes to 3 points and winning by 13, 83–70. Iowa led by as many as 19 points during the game and the Spartans never closed to within 10 in the second half. Izzo characterized the game not as \"a disappointing loss. I thought it was a disappointing effort.\" As a result of the win over the top-ranked Spartans, Iowa fans stormed the court despite having chanted \"overrated\" before the end of the game. The Spartans closed 2015 with their first loss of the season, falling to 13–1 and 0–1 in conference play.\nJanuary.\nAfter the loss to the Hawkeyes, the Spartans flew to Texas to watch the Spartan football team take on Alabama in the College Football Playoff. While in Texas, they practiced in freshman Matt McQuaid's high school gym. Following the football game, they flew to Minneapolis, Minnesota to open 2016 by taking on Minnesota on January 2. In Minneapolis, the Spartans rebounded from their first loss of the season by defeating a game Minnesota squad 69–61. Forbes led the way for the Spartans scoring 20 points and Matt Costello added 17. Following the game, Valentine presented Izzo with a game ball in remembrance of his father's passing. Izzo attended the funeral of his father the next day.\nOn January 7, Michigan State returned home for their first home game in 25 days to face Illinois. Denzel Valentine was medically cleared to play for the game, but Izzo held him out of the game. The Spartans did not need him as they romped over a short-handed Illinois team, 79–52. MSU led by as many as 30 points. Forbes led all scorers with 17 and McQuaid set a career high with 10 points. The win moved the Spartans to 15–1 overall and 2–1 in the Big Ten.\nOn January 11, MSU traveled to Penn State. Valentine was available to play, but did not start. He came off the bench and had a rough start going 0–4 from the field in the first half. Forbes led the way in the first, scoring all of his game-high 20 points in the first half, going 6–8 from beyond the arc. The Spartans led by 13 at the half and pushed the lead to as many as 31 in the second half. Valentine chipped in 10 points in the second half. The win moved the Spartans to 3–1 in conference and 16–1 overall with a rematch against Iowa looming.\nDespite having Valentine back for a home game against Iowa on January 14, Michigan State once again struggled. Iowa jumped out to an early lead and dominated the Spartans in East Lansing. Bryn Forbes struggled with foul trouble and was held to a season-low 2 points. Costello led the Spartans with 15 while Valentine had 14. Iowa made nine three-pointers and were led by Peter Jok's 22 points. “It was just a flat-ass butt kicking to be honest with you,” MSU coach Tom Izzo said. The Spartans, undefeated against every team not named Iowa, fell to 3–2 in conference play and 16–2 overall.\nThe Spartans next traveled to Madison, Wisconsin on January 17 to face the struggling Wisconsin Badgers. Prior to the game, Michigan State announced that Tum Tum Nairn would be sidelined indefinitely with plantar fasciitis. Izzo used a completely new lineup to start, with freshmen Deyonta Davis and McQuaid starting as well as Harris. The lineup made little difference as the Spartans trailed by five at half. Despite Michigan State playing better and taking the lead in the second half, Wisconsin found themselves within four points with less than a minute remaining. Bronson Koenig made a three for the Badgers which was followed by a quick Spartan turnover by Harris. Down by one, the Badgers got a basket down low to take a one-point lead. The Spartans got two shots off before the clock expired, but neither fell. The Spartans lost their second consecutive game, 77–76, falling to .500 in the Big Ten at 3–3 and 16–3 overall. Costello scored a career-high 18 and Valentine led the Spartans with 23. As a result, the Spartans fell out of the top ten rankings, slipping to 10th in the Coaches Poll and 11th in the AP Poll.\nOn January 20, MSU took on unranked Nebraska at Breslin Center. The Cornhuskers, winners of three straight games, had beaten the Spartans in their last two meetings. MSU started off strong, going up 5–0 and leading Nebraska to call a timeout 50 seconds into the game. However, Nebraska rallied to take the lead and the teams were tied at the half. However, despite a Valentine circus shot three in the last 10 seconds and an open look for the win as the clock expired, the Spartans fell to Nebraska 72–71. Shavon Shields had 28 for the Huskers. Valentine contributed 24 for MSU. Bryn Forbes struggled again, going 1–8 with three points. He had many open looks, but could not drain a shot. The Spartans also struggled from the free throw line, going 12–21 from the line. The loss was the third straight for the Spartans, falling to 16–4 and 3–4 in conference. This marked the worst conference start for the Spartans since the 2002–03 season.\nNeeding a win, MSU's next game saw ESPN visit for its Gameday program on January 23. The Spartans debuted \"Mean Green\" uniforms for the game against Maryland. The Spartans led for a majority of the game. Forbes, mired in a three-game slump, shot the lights out, scoring 25 points. Costello also had a big game, scoring 15 points, racking up 12 rebounds, three blocks, and two steals. Valentine added 24 points, just missing his third triple double with 14 rebounds and eight assists. Maryland was led by Melo Trimble, who scored 24 points but was limited to three assists with good defense by Harris. The Spartans pulled away for the much needed victory, pulling out a 74–65 win. Izzo commented on his team's effort as \"the hardest we played in years.\" The Spartans moved to 17–4 overall and 4–4 in conference.\nThe Spartans next traveled to Evanston, Illinois, to take on Northwestern on January 28. The Spartans set a season high for made three-pointers with 16 in routing the Wildcats, 76–45. Valentine led all scorers with 19. McQuaid set a new career high with 17 points. The Spartans held Northwestern to a 20.7% shooting percentage from the field. Deyonta Davis continued to improve his game, setting an MSU freshmen-high for blocks with six, a career-high 11 rebounds, and added eight points. Notably, Tom Izzo moved into second place all time for wins at a Big Ten school, breaking a tie with Gene Keady. It was Izzo's 513th win at MSU. He still trails Big Ten leader Bob Knight, who has 661. MSU's record moved to 18–4 overall and 5–4 in conference.\nThe Spartans returned home to end January to face last place Rutgers on January 31. The Spartans routed Rutgers on their way to tying a school record for three-point field goals made in a game, hitting 17. Forbes made six, all in the first half. Valentine also contributed six three-pointers, scoring a game-high 20. Costello notched another double double with 12 points and 13 rebounds. The Spartans finished January at 6–4 in conference and 19–4 overall.\nFebruary.\nThe Spartans entered February with five days off before facing perhaps the most difficult stretch of the season, including a trip to Purdue and a game against Indiana in Breslin Center. The Spartans began the trip by traveling to face rival Michigan on February 6. In their only meeting of the regular season, the Spartans jumped out early on the Wolverines and never looked back. MSU led by as many as 27 on their way to an easy 89–73 win on Michigan's home floor. The Spartans kept up their hot shooting from behind the arc, shooting 63% and hitting 14 threes. Forbes hit seven of his eight three-pointers in the first half and scored 29 to lead all players. Valentine added 21 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. The win moved the Spartans to 20–4 overall and 7–4 in conference. With a loss by Purdue later that day, the Spartans moved into a tie for fourth place in the conference.\nPrior to the match-up with Purdue, Tom Izzo announced that Nairn could be out for perhaps another month with his plantar fasciitis injury. When he returns, Izzo said he would likely be only a defensive replacement and point guard relief, playing only three to eight minutes a game. Valentine was also named Big Ten player of the week for his near triple-double against Michigan, his third time being so honored this season.\nOn February 10, MSU traveled to West Lafayette, Indiana to face Purdue. Purdue jumped on the Spartans from the opening tip led by Raphael Davis and led by as many as 18 early in the second half. However, MSU showed toughness and fought its way back behind Valentine who again just missed a triple-double with 27 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. The Spartans took the lead with 1:59 remaining at 72–68, but didn't score for the remainder of regulation. Purdue tied it and Valentine had a weak attempt to win it as the clock expired. In overtime with the teams tied at 81, a controversial foul call on Valentine with 4.9 seconds remaining gave Raphael Davis two free throws for the win. He made the first, but missed the second. However, Purdue big man A. J. Hammons secured the rebound and the win. The win was the first by Purdue over the Spartans since 2011. The loss dropped the Spartans to 20–5 and 7–5 in conference all but assuring they would be unable to win the Big Ten regular season championship.\nOn February 12, Izzo was announced as one of 14 finalists for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nOn February 14, first-place Indiana paid a trip to Breslin Center. Indiana led for a good portion of the first half, but MSU rebounded to take a one-point lead at the half, 41–40. In the second half, the Spartans took control of the game behind Valentine's 30 points and career-high 13 assists. MSU led by as many as 22 and came away with the win, 88–69. Costello had a career-high 22 points and Forbes added 14. Surprisingly, Nairn made an appearance and played less than three minutes in the game. Kenny Goins, who had played a major role for the Spartans front line in the last few games, left the game in the first half with a knee injury and it was revealed after that he would miss two to four weeks. The win put MSU at 8–5 in conference and 21–5 overall while temporarily dropping Indiana out of first place.\nOn February 15, Valentine was named Big Ten Player of the Week for the second consecutive week and fourth time overall. On February 16, Valentine was named Naismith Trophy Player of the Week.\nWisconsin brought its seven-game win streak to Breslin Center on February 18. MSU took the lead early on a 14–3 run and never looked back, winning 69–57. Valentine scored 24 points with seven rebounds and 10 assists. The output gave Valentine at least 20 points and 10 or more assists in three consecutive games, the most in the Big Ten in 20 years. Davis led the way with defense on Wisconsin's Nigel Hayes who lit up the Spartans in their first meeting, holding Hayes to 1–13 from the floor as the Izzone mercilessly chanted, \"Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!\" Forbes added 17 points and Harris added 10. The win jumped the Spartans from eighth place in the conference to a four-way tie for fourth place with a record of 9–5 and 22–5 overall.\nOn February 24, MSU visited Ohio State, owners of a four-game winning streak. The Spartans started slow, but still led 36–31 at the half. Forbes got hot in the second half, hitting seven of 10 three-pointers in the game, for 20 points in the second half. Valentine added 17 points, eight assists, and five rebounds as MSU pulled away to win 81–62. The Spartans moved into sole possession of fourth place in the Big Ten at 11–5 and 23–5 overall. In the win, Valentine passed Draymond Green for 17th all time in scoring at Michigan State.\nOn February 28, Penn State, winners of three straight games and four of their last five (with wins over then-No. 4 Iowa and then-No. 22 Indiana), visited the Breslin Center. MSU started slow, beginning three of 15 from the field, but were still up 28–9 at one point and, with almost five minutes left in the first half, PSU head coach Pat Chambers was ejected from the game with a double technical. The Spartans led 52–27 at the half and never looked back leading by as many as 35. Valentine had 19 points, eight rebounds, and six assists. Davis and Forbes added 15 points each and Costello added 10 points and 11 rebounds. MSU moved into a four-way tie for second in the conference with the win and moved their record to 12–5 and 24–5 overall.\nMarch.\nWith two games remaining in the regular season, MSU would be guaranteed at least a double bye in the Big Ten tournament with wins in those two games, at Rutgers and home versus Ohio State. With Indiana's win over Iowa (clinching the sole Big Ten title), MSU was guaranteed the No. 2 seed in the conference tournament with wins in its last two games.\nOn March 2, MSU visited Rutgers looking to strengthen its hold on the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament. However, MSU got off to a slow start and trailed for portions of the first half. However, Forbes got hot from the three-point line late in the half, making five including one with less than 10 seconds remaining in the half. As a result, MSU led by one at the half. In the second half, MSU ran away with the game, led by Forbes. His Big Ten single-game record of 11 three-point field goals (his only baskets of the game) helped MSU to a 31-point blowout. Izzo was disappointed with the performance in the first half. The Spartans moved to 25–5 overall and 12–5 in conference with one game remaining in the regular season.\nOn March 4, Izzo was named one of 12 semifinalists for the Naismith Trophy Men's Coach of the Year.\nOn Senior Day at Breslin Center, March 5, the Buckeyes looked for revenge for their home loss to the Spartans the prior weekend. Ohio State started off well and led for portions of the first half, but MSU took a 47–37 lead to the half. In the second half, MSU ran away with it, shooting 66.7% from the field in the game. Senior Denzel Valentine led the way with 27 points and 13 assists. The Spartans finished with 91–76 victory to clinch the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament. MSU finished the regular season with a 26–5 overall record and 13–5 in conference, good enough for second place in the Big Ten. The 26 wins tied the most for a Michigan State team in the regular season. The team still had the opportunity, with postseason victories, to earn the most wins ever for a Michigan State basketball team in a season.\nOn March 8, \"USA Today\" named Valentine National Player of the Year over Oklahoma's Buddy Hield. The Big Ten also announced that Valentine was the Big Ten's Player of the Year. Forbes was named Second Team All-Big Ten and Costello was voted second team by the media and third team by the coaches. Valentine was the fifth player under Izzo and eighth in Michigan State history to be named Big Ten Player of the Year. On March 9, NBCSports.com named Valentine National Player of the Year and First Team All-American. On March 9, Valentine was named to the \"Sporting News\" All-American Team.\nBig Ten tournament.\nIn the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament, MSU faced Ohio State for the third time in 18 days. And, like the prior two games, MSU blew out OSU, winning 81–54. Valentine led the way with 19 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists. The win moved MSU to 27–5 overall as they moved on to the semifinals vs. Maryland.\nIn the semifinals, MSU faced Maryland for the second time this season. The game was close throughout and offense was hard to come by in the second half. But, MSU was able to hold off Maryland to win 64–61. Valentine led the Spartans with 18 points, 7 rebounds and 10 assists. The Spartans moved to 28–5 overall and to the Big Ten Championship against Purdue.\nIn the Big Ten Championship, MSU took an early lead at halftime and led by as many as 13 in the second half. However, Purdue came back to keep it close, but MSU again pulled out a close game, winning 66–62. With the win, MSU set the record for most Big Ten tournament Championships with five (Ohio State has also won five, but one has been vacated due to NCAA violations). Valentine again led the way with 15 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists. Costello also set MSU's career block record, passing Branden Dawson, with 145. MSU's record moved to 29–5 and, presumed by many analysts, to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nFollowing the Big Ten Championship, MSU learned that it would not receive a No. 1 seed, instead receiving a No. 2 seed in the Midwest bracket. This marked the 19th consecutive year the Spartans have made the NCAA Tournament. Despite receiving the No. 2 seed, MSU was considered by many the favorite to with the NCAA Championship.\nMichigan State faced off against No. 15-seeded Middle Tennessee in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament on March 18. Middle Tennessee led throughout the game and withstood every run made by the Spartans. MSU could not overcome the Blue Raiders and were upset by a score of 90–81. Costello led the Spartans with 22 points in his final MSU game. Valentine, disappointed in his performance, had 13 points and 12 assists. Costello, Forbes, and Valentine ended their MSU careers with what some argue was the biggest upset in NCAA Tournament history.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| European summer exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nAwards and honors.\nDenzel Valentine\nOn March 20, 2016, Valentine was named one of four finalists for the Naismith Trophy.

Todd's 1998 BCHS team achieved the best finish in school history during the 1997–98 campaign as it advanced to the semi-final round of the 1998 KHSAA Sweet Sixteen Tournament where it fell to eventual champion, Elizabethtown. In 1999, Todd took over the women's basketball program at Lexington Catholic High School. From 1999 to 2006, the coach compiled a stellar 225–26 record which included three KHSAA State Championships (2001, 2005, 2006) and two runner-up finishes. Todd's 2005–06 team would earn the coach national recognition as the EA Sports National Coach of the Year award as it finished 35–1 on its way to a championship and a KHSAA record No. 3 ranking in the final USA Today national girls' basketball poll. The team featured five All-State players and seven players that signed scholarships to play in Division I. Todd finished his 14 seasons coaching in the high school ranks with a combined record of 391–80 (.830) and is the only coach in KHSAA girls' basketball history to win over 375 games and have less than 100 losses.\nIn July 2017, Todd's achievements coaching high school basketball were recognized as he was inducted into the Kentucky High School Basketball Hall of Fame in Owensboro, Kentucky. In 2019, Todd was inducted into the Berea Community School Athletics Hall of Fame as well as the Lexington Catholic High School Hall of Fame.\nFollowing his run at Lexington Catholic, Todd moved into the collegiate coaching ranks at Division III Transylvania University beginning in 2006–07 season. Todd took over a team that had a losing record the previous season and immediately improved them to a 19–9 record and a third-place finish in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. After nearly upsetting conference champion Manchester in the conference tournament final, Transylvania received the first of the three invitations to the NCAA Women's Division III Basketball Championship it would get during Todd's tenure. In his eight seasons at Transylvania, his teams won three conferences regular season and two tournament championships, accumulating a record of 157–64.\nTodd then accepted the same position at Morehead State University, leading the Morehead State Eagles, his team was picked to finish last in the twelve-team race, but finished 8–8 and in sixth place after fading from an early third place. In 2018–2019 Todd had arguably his best season as a coach as he led the Eagles to a 24–11 year capped off by a Women's National Invitational Tournament bid, only the second ever in program history. In the opening round, the Eagles traveled to Columbus, Ohio, to play the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference. After trailing most of the first half, Todd's team fought back to score an upset win over the Buckeyes 71–61, which many would consider being the program's biggest victory in the modern era. Todd's Eagles then traveled to Bowling Green, Kentucky to face Western Kentucky and eventually lost in heartbreaking fashion against the Hilltoppers in the round of 32 by a score of 68–65.\nWhile at Morehead State, Todd coached five players to First-Team All-OVC honors, two players to Second-Team All-OVC honors, two All-OVC Newcomer Team members, and one All-OVC Tournament Team member. He helped the program achieve unparalleled recruiting victories as it has signed four previous ESPN Top 100 players.\nTodd left Morehead State at the end of the 2020–2021 season to accept the same position at his alma mater, Eastern Kentucky, who in the same year departed the Ohio Valley Conference for the Atlantic Sun Conference, a league which MSU remained in.\nIn his first season, Todd led EKU to a 15–16 overall record, which improved the team's win total by six wins from the previous year. EKU earned a home game in the 2021–22 Atlantic Sun Conference Women's Basketball Tournament, defeating 6-seed Kennesaw State by a score of 71–57 to advance to the quarterfinals.\nDuring the 2022–23 season, Todd signed a total of six players out of the transfer portal, including Marquette's Antwainette Walker, who helped lead the program to an 18–14 overall record and its second consecutive trip to the Atlantic Sun Conference Women's Basketball Tournament. In the regular season, EKU would travel to Dublin, Ireland to compete in the 2022 MAAC/ASUN Dublin Challenge, defeating Rider 85–64 in the historic National Basketball Arena, home of the Ireland National Basketball programs and the Basketball Ireland headquarters. Additionally, the Colonels visited Army West Point and defeated the women's team by a vast 83–62 final score. EKU would go on to win 11 games in Atlantic Sun Conference play, ending the season with a 73–55 loss to Austin Peay in the conference quarterfinals. Antwainette Walker was named to the National Basketball Hall of Fame Ann Myers Drysdale Shooting Guard of the Year Award as well as the Dawn Staley Late Season Watchlist, both awards recognizing the top guards across NCAA Division I. She finished the season named the ASUN Newcomer of the Year and Kentucky Herald Leader Women's Player of the Year. Todd was named the Kentucky Herald Leader Women's Coach of the Year, the first honor of his career.\nIn 2023–24, Todd coached the Colonels to a 22–12 overall record and 9–7 mark in ASUN Conference play, EKU's first 20-win season since 2004–05. Eastern Kentucky opened the regular season with a 9–2 record, the best start to a season in program history, only suffering losses to the Tennessee Lady Vols coached by Kellie Harper on the road, cutting the deficit to just one point in the fourth quarter in Food City Center, and nationally ranked No. 4 Utah Utes in the 2023 Great Alaska Shootout Championship in Anchorage, Alaska. Todd earned his 700th career win as a head coach as the team upset UAB in the first round of the shootout. Todd and the Colonels won nine games in league play, earning the 5-seed in the Atlantic Sun Conference Women's Basketball Tournament, defeating Lipscomb 99–68 in the quarterfinals, the team's third consecutive season making the tournament. Two players were named All-Conference, including Antwainette Walker who was named the ASUN Preseason Player of the Year and Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year Watchlist. Todd became the fastest coach in Eastern Kentucky program history to record 50 wins, doing so in just three short seasons. He led EKU to its first appearance in the Women's National Invitational Tournament since 2002 and the first national postseason tournament since 2013, falling to Purdue Fort Wayne 83–75 in the opening round, Todd's third WNIT as a Division I head coach. Eastern Kentucky spent a program record eight weeks receiving votes in the CollegeInsider.com Women's Mid-Major Top 25 Poll, released on each Tuesday during the regular season. Also, Todd pushed the program to a record No. 162 ranking in the NCAA NET poll on Jan. 26, 2024.\nThe 2023–24 season marks Todd's fourth season at the helm.\nHead coaching record.\nSource:"

        "text": "Kananaskis Country Golf Course is a public 36-hole golf course situated in Kananaskis Country, a park system west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: in the foothills and front ranges of the Canadian Rockies.\nThe course opened in 1983 at a cost of $25.5 million. The facility is located south of Kananaskis Village, Alberta. There are two 18-hole golf layouts, named Mt. Lorette and Mt. Kidd after the mountains under which they play. The course ranks frequently in the top courses in Canada including the rankings of \"Score Golf Magazine\". The two courses host about sixty thousand rounds of golf annually with eighty-five percent played by Albertans. \nDuring the June 2013 Alberta floods, Kananaskis Country \"sustained the most extensive damage in its 36-year history.\"Alberta's government committed $18 million to rebuild the course and to protect it from future flood damage.\nHistory.\nThe course was built while Premier Peter Lougheed was in office at a cost of $25.5 million ($ million in ) using energy resource money from the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund to diversify Alberta's economy. Since its opening in 1983, Kan-Alta Golf Management Ltd has had the lease to operate the Kananaskis Country Golf Course. Kan-Alta Golf was the construction manager for the restoration of the golf course following the 2013 flood.\nArchitect.\nThe courses were designed by Robert Trent Jones. He described the course's location in the Rockies as \"the best natural setting I’ve ever been given to work with.\" Early in his career Jones had formed a partnership with Canadian architect Stanley Thompson, and he helped design several courses in Canada, including Capilano in Vancouver and Banff in the Canadian Rockies. Between 1931 and 1999, Jones designed or re-designed about 500 golf courses in at least 40 U.S. states and 35 other countries.\nGary Browning was the architect who led the flood restoration project. The project upgraded the course to six tees per hole including a very short forward distance.\nCourses.\nThe Kananaskis River runs through both golf courses. \nMount Lorette is the north course. The front nine goes through the forest and a couple of lakes are encountered starting at the fifth hole. The river is seen starting on the 14th hole and runs alongside a stretch of four holes.\nMount Kidd is the south course. The river runs along and comes into play through most of the first 12 holes before the course proceeds into the woods on the southeast segment of the property. Mount Kidd is the shorter of the courses. Holes 2 and 5 meet near a bend in the river. Mount Kidd also features the two longest par fives on the property. The course features a double green near the clubhouse. It serves the 18th of Mount Lorette and the 9th of Mount Kidd.\nRatings.\nSCOREGolf’s Golfers’ Choice Awards has recognized Kananaskis Country Golf Course as \"Best of the Best\" in the following categories: Best Value in the West, Best Service in the West, Best Condition in the West, Best par 4 in the West, Best Par 5 in the West, and Best Golf Destination in the West. Golf Digest rated the Mount Kidd and Mount Lorette in the top 50 Courses in North America for \"Great Value.\"\n\"Score Golf Magazine\" rated this facility at 7.6400, making it among the top courses in Alberta.\nIn 2011, \"ScoreGolf\" listed Mt. Kidd as the third Best Public Course in Alberta, with Mt. Lorette taking fifth place and \"Golf Week\" included Mt.Kidd on its list of Best Canadian Golf Modern Courses. In November 2011, the golf publication, \"Golf Digest\" included Kananaskis Country Golf Course on its top 75 golf resorts biennial list.\nEconomic Impact.\nIn 2011, the Kananaskis Country Golf Course showed a province wide net economic impact of $14 million, 175 full-time equivalent jobs sustained province wide, and a $4.4 million federal, $1.9 million provincial and $800,000 local taxes generated.\n2013 Alberta floods.\nThe Kananaskis I.D. in which the Kananaskis Country Golf Course is located was severely flooded in the June 2013 Alberta floods, the costliest insured natural disaster in Canadian history. Of the thirty six holes, all but four were flood damaged. Buildings on higher ground, valued at $15 million, were not damaged.\nOn 16 July 2014, Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (AESRD) finalized and signed an agreement with Kan-Alta Golf Management Ltd., a company with alleged connections the provincial government to rebuild the golf course.\nCalgary Herald journalist McClure reported a \"secret deal\" involving AESRD, \"resulted in over $5.4 million\" paid to Kan-Alta Golf \"to cover business losses and other expenses\" at the Kananaskis Country Golf Course, as a result of the 2013 flood damage. Also, \"another $145,000 in property taxes owed by Kan-Alta Golf Management Ltd. were forgiven by government appointees on the local improvement district and reimbursement sought from the province.\" This was confirmed by Alberta Municipal Affairs. McClure added that \"another $8 million in compensation and some portion of the $15-million estimate for rebuilding the 36-hole facility may yet be paid to Kan-Alta.\"\nAccording to an independent report by Deloitte LLP in September 2015, Alberta taxpayers would have to pay up to $16.9 million to break the contract with Kan-Alta. The contract between the PC government of Alberta and the company \"dates back to the course’s opening in 1983 when documents show the firm — owned by friends and former associates of former Premier Don Getty who have donated $2,600 to the Tories in recent years — was awarded the contract to operate the facility even though government documents show they were not the lowest bidder.\" The contract will be put out to public tender until 2026. \"No one in our government wants to be in the golf course business … and in 2026 this will be put out to public tender."

David Miller was sent to open the innings for the first time in the series with Quinton de Kock, who put on 72 runs together. de Kock put on 118 runs together with Faf du Plessis (60 off 63 balls), on course, reaching his hundred off 114 balls. The team finished with 7/270 after 50 overs.\nIndia, chasing 271, began well before losing Shikhar Dhawan in the 11th over. Virat Kohli (77 off 99) batted in two notable partnerships — with Rohit Sharma (65 off 74) for the second wicket and MS Dhoni (47 off 61) for the third wicket. Morne Morkel (4/39 off 10 overs) picked up the wickets of Dhoni and Kohli in his 9th and 10th overs, as India's middle order fell, before finishing off at 6/252 after 50 overs.\n4th ODI.\nIndia won the toss, chose to bat first compiled a total of 299 losing 8 wickets. Rohit Sharma's dismissal in the fifth over brought Virat Kohli to the crease, who batted in two century partnerships. He put on 104 runs with Ajinkya Rahane (45 off 53 balls) for the third wicket and 127 with Suresh Raina (53 off 52 balls) for the fourth wicket. Kohli finished with 138 off 140 balls before being dismissed in the 49th over by Kagiso Rabada, who finished with figures off 3/54 off his 10 overs.\nChasing 300, South Africa lost early wickets, and then at regular intervals, losing 3 wickets for 32 runs between the 10th and 20th over. AB de Villiers came to the crease on Faf du Plessis's dismissal in the 15th over, and brought his hundred up off 98 balls, with a six in the 43rd over. Losing wickets at the other end at regular intervals, his partnership with Farhaan Behardien of 56 runs was the highest of the South African innings. They finished 9/264 in the 50 overs. With his hundred, his 22nd, de Villiers went past Herschelle Gibbs and Hashim Amla as the most hundreds by a South African batsman.\n5th ODI.\nSouth Africa won the toss and chose to bat first on a flat pitch. It lost its first wicket with Hashim Amla getting dismissed for 23 in the fourth over. Quinton de Kock made his second hundred of the series, coming off 78 balls and put on 154 runs with Faf du Plessis for the second wicket before losing his wicket in the 27th over. du Plessis got his hundred as well off 105 balls before being retiring due to cramps, after scoring 133 from 115 balls. AB de Villiers batted on and reached his hundred off 57 balls and was dismissed at 119 off 61 balls, before the team completed its innings at 4/438.\nChasing 439, India lost its first wicket in the fifth over and second in the eighth over, before Shikhar Dhawan (60 off 59) and Ajinkya Rahane (87 off 58) put on 112 runs for the third wicket. Wickets continued to fall henceforth, before the team was dismissed in the 36th over for 224.\nMany records were equaled or broken on course of the match. South Africa's total of 438 was the joint third-highest in ODIs. It was only the second time that three batsmen from the same team scored individual centuries in an ODI innings. Bhuvneshwar Kumar's concession of 106 runs off his ten overs was the second-highest in an ODI. Hashim Amla became the fastest to reach 6,000 runs in ODIs, in 123 innings.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nOn a pitch which looked heavily in favour of spinners, Virat Kohli won the toss and India elected to bat. Despite a good start and base given by Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara, India were bowled out for 201 in their 1st innings. However, the Indian spinners stuck to make sure that South Africa, despite AB de Villiers's 63, conceded a lead of 17 runs. India again had a strong foundation laid by Vijay and Pujara after Shikhar Dhawan picked up a pair. But a collapse of 38/8 meant that South Africa needed 218 to win the Test. The Indian spinners led by Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja bowled South Africa out for 109 to hand India a 108 run victory. The match was the fourth consecutive match in India which finished within three days.\n2nd Test.\nThe 2nd Test started with Indian captain Virat Kohli's surprise decision to bowl first. India included Stuart Binny and Ishant Sharma in place of Amit Mishra and Umesh Yadav. The Indian spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, took 8 wickets between them to dismiss South Africa for 214. Indian openers Murli Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan started positively and at the end of Day 1 India was in a strong position. However, strong and persistent rain on next 4 days meant that the match ended in a draw without any further play.\n3rd Test.\nIndia batted first and despite a strong start, a middle-order collapse meant India were all out for 215. The day ended with Dean Elgar and Hashim Amla batting. The first session on day 2 changed the game decisively in India's favour after South Africa were reduced to 17/5. Despite a counter-attacking innings from JP Duminy, India bowled them out for 79. The Indian 2nd innings was a repeat of their 1st innings with India suffering a middle-order collapse to be all out for 173, setting South Africa a target of 310 runs. The 2nd day ended with Dean Elgar and Hashim Amla batting. The 3rd day of the match was the final day as South Africa, despite a long partnership from captain Amla and Faf du Plessis were dismissed for 185 with Ravichandran Ashwin taking seven wickets. The pitch for the match was heavily criticized for offering extreme turn and variable bounce. The pitch was later rated as being poor by the ICC.\n4th Test.\nThe fourth and final Test of the series was the only one which went beyond the third day. India again won the toss and chose to bat but a familiar batting collapse took place. However, a 98 run partnership between Ajinkya Rahane and Ravichandran Ashwin resulted in the first 300 run innings of the series. Rahane scored the first century of the series as well. South Africa's reply was a repeat of their earlier batting collapses, with batsmen after batsmen falling to spin bowling. India in their 2nd innings on back of second century for Rahane and a fighting 88 from captain Virat Kohli, declared at 267 to set South Africa a target of 481. However, a marathon blockathon from Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis and Temba Bavuma could not help South Africa, as India won by 337 runs in the final session of the series. Rahane for his two centuries was named the man of the match, while Ashwin's 31 wickets made him the man of the series. Rahane became only the 5th Indian batsmen to score two centuries in a match while Ashwin's 31 wickets were the second highest for an Indian bowler behind Harbhajan Singh's 32 wickets in the 2001 series against Australia.\nAnti-Pakistan protests at Mumbai.\nOn the morning of 19 October, BCCI president Shashank Manohar and PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan were to discuss a proposed India-Pakistan series in December. Just before the meeting, a group of 50 workers from the Shiv Sena, a political party, stormed into the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai, shouting anti-Pakistan slogans and demanding the cancellation of the series. They also threatened to stop Aleem Dar from officiating in the Mumbai ODI.\nAleem Dar, a member of the elite panel of ICC umpires, had officiated in the first three ODIs, and was also scheduled to umpire in the fourth and fifth ODIs, in Chennai and Mumbai. In response to the above incident ICC decided to withdraw Dar from the last two ODIs. Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar, a part of the commentary team, decided to leave India before the fifth ODI at Mumbai."

        "text": "The Stony Brook Seawolves women's lacrosse team is a college women's lacrosse program representing Stony Brook University. The school competes in the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The team plays its home games at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, located on the university's campus in Stony Brook, New York. \nStony Brook has appeared in 10 consecutive NCAA Tournaments since 2013, advancing to the quarterfinals four times. Stony Brook completed an undefeated regular season in 2018, in which the Seawolves were ranked at No. 1 in all major polls for nearly the entire year. From 2017 to 2019, Stony Brook won 29 straight regular season games. The Seawolves currently own a 69-game winning streak in conference play, the longest active streak in any Division I sport, and a 38-game home win streak, the longest active in Division I women's lacrosse.\nUnder head coach Joe Spallina, Stony Brook has built an identity of a national powerhouse constructed out of overlooked Long Island recruits. Kylie Ohlmiller, who played for Stony Brook from 2015 to 2018, holds both the NCAA career and single season records for points and assists. Courtney Murphy, who played for Stony Brook from 2014 to 2018, broke the NCAA career and single season records for goals.\nHistory.\nFormation and beginnings (2001–2011).\nStony Brook University formed their women's lacrosse team in 2001 with Danie Caro as their first head coach, with the announcement that the program would begin play during the 2003 season. In the team's first season, the Seawolves finished in third place in the conference but advanced to the semifinals in the America East playoffs, losing 15–4 to Boston University.\nCaro left the program in 2005 and was replaced by former Maryland player and four-time national champion Allison Comito. Under Comito, the Seawolves returned to the semifinal round of the America East playoffs in both 2006 and 2007. The 2007 team went 13–4, the first time Stony Brook had won double-digit games, and the team tied for first place in the America East. Comito resigned following the 2011 season, amassing a 42–54 record in her six-year tenure as head coach.\nSpallina establishes success (2012–2014).\nJoe Spallina, who had won three straight Division II titles as the coach at Adelphi University, succeeded Comito. In Spallina's first season, the Seawolves improved their win total by ten, from 4 to 14, as the Seawolves finished second in the America East. Stony Brook defeated UMBC 9–7 in the America East semifinals before losing to Albany in the conference finals, falling one game short of their first NCAA Tournament. Stony Brook finished with a 14–5 record in Spallina's first season as head coach.\nStony Brook had their most successful season yet in 2013, going undefeated in conference play for the first time, winning their second regular season conference championship and beating Vermont 18–4 and Albany 14–3 in the America East playoffs to win their first America East Tournament and advance to their first NCAA Tournament. There, they defeated Towson 8–6 in the first round for their first NCAA Tournament victory but lost in the second round to No. 1 Maryland. Still, the team's final 17–3 record bore the program the most single-season wins to date, beginning the first of six consecutive conference championships. For the first time in team history, Stony Brook was ranked Top 10 in a major national poll. Also on March 9, 2013 against Longwood, Claire Petersen set the NCAA single-game assist record with 11.\nStony Brook returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2014 after a 17–4 season where they tied for first place in the America East regular season, including victories over New Hampshire and Albany in the America East playoffs. In the first round, the Seawolves faced Towson again and won 10–8, advancing to the second round where they lost to Syracuse. Spallina became Stony Brook's all-time winningest coach after the season.\nOhlmiller and Murphy break records (2015–2018).\nIn 2015, the first season which Kylie Ohlmiller and Courtney Murphy played together, Stony Brook finished with an 18–2 record. On March 17, the Seawolves beat No. 6/7 Florida on the road in Gainesville, the team's first victory over a Top 10-ranked opponent in program history. They started the season 11–0 before losing to No. 20 Johns Hopkins. After disposing of UMBC and Albany in the America East Tournament, Stony Brook earned the No. 6 seed in their third straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Coming out of a first round bye, the Seawolves lost 8–4 to Princeton.\nStony Brook entered the 2016 season ranked No. 11/8. Although they lost to ranked opponents Florida, Northwestern, and USC to start the season 2–3, the Seawolves would embark on a 15-game winning streak, including wins against No. 9/8 Stanford and No. 20 Johns Hopkins.

        "text": "The 2015 Giro d'Italia began on 9 May, and stage 12 occurred on 21 May.\nStage 12.\nThe 12th stage of the Giro featured another chance for the Classics specialists to take a stage victory. The first of the stage was entirely flat before the riders tackled three categorised climbs on the route - the fourth category Castelnuovo, the third category Crosara and the fourth category Monte Berico. Along with the three climbs, the uncategorised climb of Perarolo was also located on the route. The ascent of Monte Berico started at around from the finish, averaging 7.1% and going all the way to the finish. The short climb provided a chance for the general classification contenders to make some differences in the overall standings.\nFor the first , no rider could break away from the peloton as the riders' pace was at around during that stretch. Finally, 5 riders, consisting of 's Patrick Gretsch, 's Davide Appollonio, 's Enrico Barbin, 's Kenny Elissonde and 's Nick van der Lijke, were able to build a gap on the peloton. However, they were not allowed to build a big lead as the peloton only allowed them to have an advantage of around 2 minutes. The peloton began to reel them in one by one with around still remaining with Gretsch being the last rider reeled in by the peloton. Afterwards, Gianfranco Zilioli of attacked but Louis Vervaeke of joined and dropped him but he was not able to build much of a gap and soon, he was also caught. As the riders approached the summit of Crosara, Beñat Intxausti also attacked but his only focus was maintaining the blue jersey. Maglia rosa wearer, Alberto Contador, also gave in a little dig to put him in the right place on the descent.\nOn the descent, several riders crashed including Simon Gerrans, dropping him out of contention for the stage win. At the front, Alexandre Geniez attacked but his descending style got him off-road and he was also caught. The peloton also split on the descent but they eventually regrouped into a smaller peloton. With around to go, Franco Pellizotti of attacked and although he tried to go solo, 's Tanel Kangert chased and joined him. The duo were able to build a gap of nearly 30 seconds as the riders closed in on the ascent of Monte Berico. In the final kilometre, Kangert was able to distance Pellizotti but Kangert was also caught with around left. After a while, Philippe Gilbert attacked and no one was able to catch him as he took his second Giro stage win. From behind, the peloton split into three groups with Contador taking second place and the 6 bonus seconds, 3 seconds behind Gilbert. With Fabio Aru finishing 8 seconds in arrears of Contador and coupled with the time bonuses he gained, Contador stayed in pink and extended his general classification lead over Aru to 17 seconds.\nStage 13.\nAfter two stages partially designed for Classics specialists, the riders tackled an entirely flat course designed for pure sprinters. No climbs were included on the route and no uphill roads were included on the stage. The final could have introduced winds that sparked echelons in the peloton and rain could have also been a factor on the stage, especially on the expected bunch sprint in the finale.\nUnlike the previous stage when a break was not allowed to go away easily, a break was already established early, consisting of 's Rick Zabel, 's Jérôme Pineau and 's Marco Frapporti. The break was not allowed to build a large gap, however, as the peloton only allowed them to have an advantage of around two and a half minutes before chasing them. At one point during the stage, the break was stopped by a crossing train and as a result, the peloton also slowed down to allow the break to build a gap again. However, the advantage of the breakaway went down from two minutes to just around one minute. Frapporti won the first intermediate sprint while Zabel won the second intermediate sprint. However, the peloton was quickly closing in on the three breakaway riders.\nWith the chase being led by the sprinters' teams, the gap was down to around 30 seconds with around left and with left, the lead of the trio was down to 14 seconds. The trio would eventually be caught from the finish. After all riders regrouped, led the peloton for around before took over with to go, trying to set up their sprinter, Giacomo Nizzolo. However, with left, a crash took down most of the riders. Among those caught in the crash were general classification contenders, Alberto Contador and Richie Porte. As the crash took place just outside the banner, time lost would stand. Meanwhile, up front, took over the peloton as the riders were closing in on the finish. perfectly led out their sprinter, Sacha Modolo, as Modolo took the stage win ahead of Nizzolo and Elia Viviani. Main general classification contenders, Fabio Aru and Rigoberto Urán, both of whom were able to escape the crash, finished four seconds behind Modolo; Contador finished 36 seconds behind Aru, while Porte lost two minutes on the day. As a result of the crash, Aru took over the maglia rosa ahead of the individual time trial, with a 19-second advantage over Contador. It was the first time in his career that Contador lost a leader's jersey in a Grand Tour after wearing the jersey previously during the race.\nStage 14.\nFeaturing the only individual time trial of this year's Giro, the stage was the longest individual time trial since 2009 when Denis Menchov won Stage 12, a test, on his way to overall victory. The riders travelled from Treviso to Valdobbiadene, the home of prosecco and tiramisu. The first of the stage was flat while the rest of the stage was hilly, including the fourth category climb of San Pietro Di Feletto in the middle of the stage. After the climb, a short descent followed before the riders went up a hill again. Another short descent followed before a short climb to the finish. The stage was considered as the most crucial of the Giro and was expected to build huge time gaps between the riders. Following tradition, the riders set off in reverse order of the general classification, starting from the last-placed rider to the leader of the standings. Thus, Marco Coledan of , who was 3h 15' 15\" behind maglia rosa wearer Fabio Aru at the start of the day, was the first rider off the start ramp.\nHowever, Coledan was not the first rider to cross the finish line as Michael Hepburn, the third rider off the start ramp, set a time of 1h 21' 05\" to set the early time to beat. Shortly after, Nikolay Mihaylov beat Hepburn's times at the intermediate time checks before setting the best time at the finish of 1h 20' 32\", 33 seconds faster than Hepburn's time. Christopher Juul-Jensen and Alexander Porsev went close to beating Mihaylov's time but they both fell short at the finish. After a while, Luke Durbridge took Mihaylov out of the hot seat, setting a time of 1h 19' 28\", bettering Mihaylov's time by more than a minute. Time trial specialist, Kristof Vandewalle went close to beating Durbridge's time but Vandewalle came back from a crash and fell short by 5 seconds. However, both Vasil Kiryienka and Patrick Gretsch went faster than Durbridge's time. Gretsch set a time of 1h 18' 15\" to knock Durbridge off the hot seat but Kiryienka immediately beat Gretsch with a time of 1h 17' 52\", 23 seconds better than Gretsch. Kiryienka's time would not be beaten as he took his third Giro stage win.\nThe focus would eventually shift to the general classification favourites. Change in weather and wind direction played a factor in the stage result and it made it hard for the late starters to set faster times than the early starters. Riders like Jurgen Van den Broeck, Andrey Amador and Leopold König set good times that were enough to move them up the standings. Soon, the four main overall contenders, Richie Porte, Rigoberto Urán, Alberto Contador and Aru went off the start ramp. Porte was the first to set off and although he was expected to set a good time, he struggled as he only finished with a time of 1h 22' 12\" in 55th place, 4' 20\" behind Kiryienka. Urán, who was a favourite for the stage victory, struggled as well and he could not repeat his performance in the previous year's stage 12 time trial. He could only set a time of 1h 20' 37\", 2' 45\" behind in 23rd place. After some time, Contador went off the start ramp and despite the effects of his injury and his tweaked time trial position, he set the fastest time of all the general classification favourites. Despite being 1' 05\" off Kiryienka's pace at the first intermediate time check, Contador put significant time gaps into his main rivals, even catching his three-minute man, Mikel Landa, on the course as he eventually recorded a time of 1h 18' 06\", the third best time and just 14 seconds behind Kiryienka's time. Aru did his best to limit his losses but he could only finish with a time of 1h 20' 53\", 3' 01\" behind Kiryienka and more importantly, 2' 47\" behind Contador. As a result of the huge time gaps, Urán rose to fourth place in the overall standings, 4' 14\" behind, while Porte suffered as he dropped to 17th place in the general classification, 8' 52\" in arrears. More importantly, Contador retook the maglia rosa by 2' 28\" over Aru in second with Amador in third at 3' 36\" behind.\nStage 15.\nTo end the race's second week, the riders tackled the second high-mountain stage of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, the first of two Dolomites stages. There were three categorised climbs on the course - the second category La Fricca, the first category Passo Daone and the final first category ascent to the summit finish at Madonna di Campiglio. The ascent to Madonna di Campiglio was well known for its appearance in 1999 when Marco Pantani won the stage finishing at the ski resort. Pantani was eventually expelled from the race before the next stage due to a high hematocrit level. This stage was expected to feature another showdown between the race's main general classification favorites.\nAfter four successive stages marred by bad weather, the riders rode the stage under clear blue skies. No rider was able to break away until the middle of the climb to La Fricca when a ten-man group slowly made their way to the front. The best-placed rider in the breakaway was Giovanni Visconti of , who was 6' 04\" behind maglia rosa wearer, Alberto Contador, before the stage. The break was only allowed to build a gap of around 2 minutes before the peloton began the chase. As the break began to close in on the climb of Passo Daone, Visconti, 's Kanstantsin Sivtsov, 's Hubert Dupont and 's Brent Bookwalter attacked out of the breakaway and managed to build a gap again while the other six breakaway riders chose to wait for the peloton to catch up to them. On the ascent of Passo Daone, general classification contenders, Richie Porte and Rigoberto Urán were both dropped by the peloton. Porte eventually lost 27 minutes on the day and withdrew from the race the next day while Urán lost 8 minutes on the day to drop out of the top 10. Up front, Bookwalter was distanced on the ascent and at the top of the climb, Visconti took the maximum mountains classification points. In the peloton, Contador found himself isolated with no teammates around him while rival Fabio Aru still had five riders for support.\nOn the descent, several riders crashed and chief among them was Contador's teammate Roman Kreuziger, in ninth place overall. As the four-man break neared Madonna di Campiglio, Sivtsov and Visconti dropped back to help their teammates, leaving Dupont as the lone breakaway rider. He was eventually caught after the second intermediate sprint, where Contador sprinted to take two bonus seconds. On the final ascent, continued to set the pace and the group of favourites continued to dwindle down until eight riders remained with to go. When Tanel Kangert finally let go of the pace, Mikel Landa sparked the attacks at the front. He was chased down by Contador while Aru struggled behind. Aru and Yuri Trofimov eventually bridged the gap to Contador and Landa. Contador would also put in an attack but his three companions were able to chase him down. Trofimov was dropped shortly after but as the trio up front neared the final kilometre, Trofimov rejoined the group, and attacked past them, taking advantage of the general classification battle between Contador and Aru. Landa chased after Trofimov, catching and passing him with to go. Landa stayed up front to take the stage win, two seconds ahead of Trofimov. Contador gained one second on Aru at the finish and also took the time bonuses for third place. The riders finished scattered behind, shaking up the general classification standings once more as Contador extended his lead over Aru to 2' 35\" while Andrey Amador held on to his third place, 4' 19\" behind in arrears. Contador stayed in pink ahead of the second and final rest day with six stages remaining in the Giro. Following Porte's withdrawal, thus turned their hopes to Leopold König, in fifth place overall after the stage.\nStage 16.\nThe queen stage of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, the first stage in the third week of the race consisted of five categorised climbs. The first climb, the second-category Campo Carlo Magno, commenced immediately after the start and saw the riders reach an altitude of . After the descent, and a short false-flat section, the riders climbed the Tonale Pass, which was also a second category climb, followed by the third-category ascent to Aprica, with the riders crossing the finish of the stage for the first time on its summit. Although averaging 3.5%, the gradient topped 15% at the start of the ascent. The first intermediate sprint occurred partway through the ascent. Having descended from there and after passing the second intermediate sprint in Tirano, the riders had to tackle the Mortirolo Pass. The climb was not especially high, at , but with an average gradient of 10.9% and reaching 18% halfway through the ascent. After a long descent, the riders ascended to Aprica again, with the finish occurring at an altitude of .\nAfter a sunny day to Madonna di Campiglio, the rain again played a factor on the stage. On the ascent of Campo Carlo Magno, several riders attempted to build a breakaway until nine riders were able to build a gap on the descent. The best-placed rider in the breakaway was 's Ryder Hesjedal, who was sitting in 13th place, 11' 17\" behind maglia rosa wearer, Alberto Contador. Two additional riders, 's Sander Armée and 's Simon Clarke, bridged over to the break to make it 11 riders in the breakaway. Their advantage only reached around two minutes after of racing, prompting Hesjedal to attack his breakaway companions on the first ascent to Aprica. He was able to quickly build a gap of around one to two minutes on the descent. At this point, 's Diego Rosa fell off his bike, while Contador had a mechanical problem. At the same time, and immediately pressed on the pace at the front, sparking a bit of controversy over respect and fair play. Contador immediately received the wheel of teammate, Ivan Basso, but by the time he was riding again, his group was nearly a minute behind the group containing Fabio Aru. Aru's group immediately caught the breakaway riders, including Hesjedal. With a deficit of 52 seconds at the start of the Mortirolo, Contador attacked out of his group.\nOn the ascent of Mortirolo, several riders continued to fall off the back, with Mikel Landa pressing on the pace at the front. Contador quickly caught the dropped riders, working with several riders in order to bridge the gap to Aru. His deficit hovered around 40 to 50 seconds before he slowly closed the gap with the help of riders like compatriot Igor Antón. With around to go, Aru's group was within sight of Contador and after a bit more effort, he finally bridged the gap to the leading chasers which consisted of two riders, Aru and Landa with Steven Kruijswijk further up the front. Contador soon attacked on his own, immediately pursued by Kruijswijk while Landa was instructed by Aru to give chase as well. Aru struggled to catch the leading group and he continued to lose time on the ascent. He was passed and dropped by Yuri Trofimov and Hesjedal as they closed in on the summit. At the top, it was Kruijswijk who led the leading trio while Trofimov and Hesjedal were almost a minute behind. Third-placed overall, Andrey Amador, also caught and dropped Aru as they passed the summit over a minute and a half behind the leading trio.\nOn the long descent, Contador set a fast pace, quickly followed by Kruijswijk and Landa. Trofimov descended the Mortirolo aggressively, dropping Hesjedal in the process. He came within ten seconds of Contador's group before dropping back. Aru also set an aggressive pace on the descent, catching up to Amador before stopping due to a mechanical problem. When Aru changed his bike, he forgot to pick up a bidon and as he was already within of the finish, he was not allowed to get a bidon or he would be penalised. As a result, Aru had to finish the rest of the stage without having a drink. At one point, Aru had Trofimov, Hesjedal and Amador within his sights on the ascent to Aprica but he continued to drop back and he lost more time to Contador. With the leading trio within of the finish, Kruijswijk attacked but he was quickly chased by Contador and Landa. In turn, Landa attacked in pursuit of another stage win and although Contador tried to give chase, Landa continued to increase his advantage. Landa would not be caught as he took his second successive stage victory, 38 seconds ahead of Kruijswijk and Contador with Amador's group finishing more than two minutes behind after distancing Hesjedal by a few metres. Landa's stage victory marked the first time that a rider won multiple stages at the 2015 race. The riders behind finished within scattered groups but at considerable distances behind as only fifteen riders finished within ten minutes of Landa's time. Trofimov's strong ride allowed him to enter the top 5 while Kruijswijk's and Hesjedal's ride moved them inside the top 10. Aru crossed the line nearly three minutes behind his teammate, Landa, and in the process, Landa moved up to second overall, 50\" ahead of Aru in third but 4' 02\" behind Contador, who retained his maglia rosa with five stages left.\nStage 17.\nThe only stage of the 2015 Giro d'Italia to go outside of Italy, the stage was the last chance for the sprinters to win a stage before the final flat stage to Milan. from the start of the stage, the riders tackled the only categorised climb of the route - the third category ascent of Teglio. Following the descent, the course was mostly flat with only two short and uncategorised climbs near the end of the stage. At around from the end of the stage, the riders reached Switzerland, finishing near the Lake of Lugano.\nJust into the stage, 's Iljo Keisse, 's Marco Bandiera and 's Giacomo Berlato immediately went on the attack. Despite the fact that no one in the breakaway posed a threat in the general classification, the trio was only allowed an advantage of around three minutes, with the sprinters' teams controlling the pace. At the first intermediate sprint, the break took the first three places before points classification leader, Elia Viviani, outsprinted Giacomo Nizzolo to increase his lead in the classification. At the second intermediate sprint, the break took the first three places again before Nizzolo outsprinted Viviani to negate Viviani's earlier advantage gained. Up front, the breakaway's advantage began to drop quickly and with remaining, the advantage was down to less than a minute before the peloton slowed the pace a bit. However, with left, the break's lead was just around 30 seconds before the break was finally caught with remaining in the stage.\nWith around remaining, Adam Hansen and Patrick Gretsch attacked off the front on a short uncategorised ascent. Darwin Atapuma tried to give chase and he successfully did so after a few seconds of chasing. Hansen soon took off solo with Gretsch and Atapuma returning to the peloton. Hansen, riding in his 11th consecutive Grand Tour, was able to build a lead of 20 seconds before the -led peloton brought the gap down quickly. Shortly before the race reached Switzerland, Hansen was caught and took over the pacing in the peloton. With left from the finish, Tom-Jelte Slagter attacked in a bid to win the stage. He was quickly chased by Philippe Gilbert but both riders were unable to build a substantial gap. Luca Paolini was next to attack with around remaining and he was able to build a decent gap. However, the peloton quickly gave chase and with around remaining, Paolini was caught. During the finale, Luka Mezgec tried to sprint for his second Giro stage win but did a perfect lead-out once again, setting up Sacha Modolo for his second stage win and his team's fourth in the race. Nizzolo overtook Mezgec to take second on the stage and he assumed the lead in the points classification after Viviani missed out on the top 10. The general classification contenders finished safely within the peloton and with no change overall, Alberto Contador kept the maglia rosa.\nStage 18.\nProbably the last chance for a breakaway to bring home a victory, the stage featured the first category climb of Monte Ologno near the end of the stage. The first of the stage was mostly flat but had several lumps along the way before the riders tackled the climb of Monte Ologno. The climb was expected to test everyone, especially the general classification contenders, as it was long at an average gradient of 9%. After reaching its summit and after a very short descent, the riders ascended an uncategorised climb before descending again. Another short uncategorised climb was located along the way but the descent went all the way until remaining, where the riders tackled a flat ride to the finish in Verbania.\nA fast start to the stage prevented any break from forming until into the stage when a 14-man group attacked out of the peloton. However, shortly after the break was made, 's Roberto Ferrari and 's Damiano Cunego crashed up front. While Ferrari dropped down to a chase group with 's Fabio Felline and 's Jesús Herrada, Cunego withdrew from the race. The peloton caught the chase group and allowed the break to have a maximum advantage of around 13 minutes, almost making sure that someone from the break would take the stage win. It was not until the climb of Monte Ologno that the day featured more drama in terms of the general classification and the stage win.\nOn the ascent of Monte Ologno, the break split into two with some riders from the breakaway dropping back on the climb's steep gradients. The gap between the two breakaway groups hovered at around a minute. Behind, a crash took place, bringing down most of the riders but the most notable rider caught behind it was 's Mikel Landa, who was sitting in second place overall. At the front of the peloton, maglia rosa wearer, Alberto Contador, told his team, , to up the pace. After a while, Contador attacked solo and he immediately built a gap of around two minutes. Contador's attack was presumed by many as payback for what happened on the Mortirolo two days earlier but Contador said after the stage that he told his team to press on the pace even before Landa was caught behind in the crash. A chase group consisting of most of the top 10 riders formed in pursuit of Contador with Landa joining that group after a huge effort. Further up the climb, Contador dropped his chain but he was quickly helped by his mechanic and he was able to keep his lead. Eventually, the only rider to catch up to Contador was 's Ryder Hesjedal, who caught up to Contador at the summit of the climb at around 7 minutes behind the breakaway with the chase group a further minute behind the duo.\nOn the descent, Davide Villella, who was an original part of the breakaway, was caught by Hesjedal and Contador. Villella, who was Hesjedal's teammate, helped the duo build and maintain their advantage over their chasers. Contador's group maintained a minute-and-a-half advantage over their chase group but still at a large deficit behind the breakaway riders. Up front, the first breakaway group led the second breakaway group by nearly a minute before 's Philippe Gilbert attacked from the second breakaway group and he was able to get to the front group on the descent. With left for the break, Gilbert immediately attacked and he was able to build a substantial gap. Several riders from the remnants of the breakaway tried to chase Gilbert but only Francesco Manuel Bongiorno managed to build a gap over the other riders. Gilbert managed to stay up front to take his second win of the race with Bongiorno crossing the finish line 47 seconds behind. The remnants of the break finished a further 14 seconds behind Bongiorno while Hesjedal led Contador across the line, 6' 05\" behind Gilbert. The group with Aru and Landa crossed the line 7' 18\" behind Gilbert and crucially, 1' 13\" behind Contador and Hesjedal. Hesjedal's ride moved him up one spot in the top ten to ninth overall, eight seconds behind eighth-placed Steven Kruijswijk. As a result of his successful attack, Contador extended his lead over Landa to 5' 15\" with two key mountain stages and one flat stage remaining in the race.\nStage 19.\nThe penultimate mountain stage of the 2015 Giro d'Italia was expected to feature one of the final showdowns between the main general classification contenders. The first of the stage was a bit hilly, featuring the third category climb of Croce Serra. The final of the stage was crucial as it featured three first category climbs. The riders had to tackle the climb of Saint-Barthélemy first, an almost -long ascent with an average gradient of 6.7%. Following the descent, the riders climbed the Col De Saint-Pantaléon, which was long and had an average gradient of 7.2%. After another descent, the riders climbed to Cervinia with the finish line located at a height of . The final climb was not very steep, averaging only 5% but was in length. The hardest part of the climb came in its middle section with an section having an average gradient of around 7%, before the riders completed the last to the finish in Cervinia. of the last of the stage went uphill.\nAnother fast start to the stage prevented any breakaway from forming easily. After a while, eight riders broke clear from the peloton. The break was not allowed to build a large gap, however, as they only had a maximum advantage of around four minutes on the peloton. soon took over the chase and the gap began to come down. On the first difficult climb of the day, the climb of Saint-Barthélemy, the break began to dwindle down as some of the breakaway riders dropped on the climb. From behind, Steven Kruijswijk and Beñat Intxausti attacked in a battle for the mountains classification. The duo built a short gap before dropping back with Intxausti taking more points at the summit of the climb. As the climb of Col De Saint-Pantaléon got underway, 's Giovanni Visconti went off solo with 's Pavel Kochetkov and 's Vasil Kiryienka chasing him. Kiryienka was caught on the climb while Visconti continued to stay up front with Kochetkov chasing him. Kochetkov slowly fell back while the -led peloton kept Visconti's advantage hovering around two minutes on the maglia rosa group. At the summit, Visconti took maximum points, taking over the lead in the mountains classification.\nOn the short descent of the climb, Kochetkov only had a gap of around 20 seconds over the peloton while Visconti still had a lead of almost two minutes. As the riders reached the lower slopes of the climb to Cervinia, Kochetkov was caught by the -led peloton while Visconti saw his advantage continue to shrink quickly. With around left in the stage, Visconti was finally caught and several minutes later, Mikel Landa gave in a small dig at the front, followed quickly by maglia rosa wearer, Alberto Contador, and Ryder Hesjedal. After the trio were caught by a small number of riders, Hesjedal attacked and he quickly built a substantial advantage. Shortly after, Fabio Aru, who struggled in the previous mountain stages, attacked from a small chase group while Contador chose to mark Landa instead of chasing Aru. Aru quickly bridged over to Hesjedal and he immediately accelerated off the front, dropping Hesjedal in the process. Aru continued to increase his advantage to the line, soloing to a 28-second victory over Hesjedal. Rigoberto Urán, who also struggled in the previous mountain stages, crossed the line in third at 1' 10\" down on Aru following a great ride while a chase group containing Contador, Landa, Kruijswijk and Tanel Kangert finished 1' 18\" behind. Another strong ride from Hesjedal saw him rise to seventh in the general classification standings while Aru regained his second place from his teammate, Landa, with an advantage of 38 seconds over his teammate but with a 4' 37\" deficit to Contador, who continued to stay in pink with one final mountain stage and a flat stage remaining in the race.\nStage 20.\nThe final mountain stage of the race decided the placings in the overall general classification. The first of the stage served as warm-up before the riders tackled the climb of the Colle delle Finestre. With its summit at a height of , it was the Cima Coppi as the highest point reached in the race. The climb, with 45 hairpins, was long with an average gradient of 9.2%. The first half of the climb was paved, before the remainder was run on dirt roads. Following a short descent, the riders ascended the easier third category climb to Sestriere. The climb was long and averaged 5.4%. The finish line was located at a height of .\nSeveral kilometres after the start of the stage, nine riders broke clear of the peloton. The breakaway group was not allowed to build a large gap, however, as they were only allowed to build a maximum advantage of nearly three minutes. As the riders reached the foot of the climb of the Colle delle Finestre, the break's advantage was down to around a minute before 's Giacomo Berlato attacked his breakaway companions with 's Ilnur Zakarin chasing him solo. The seven other breakaway riders were quickly caught by the peloton. Berlato eventually struggled on the climb as he was passed by Zakarin. In the peloton, 's Stefano Pirazzi broke clear to pursue Zakarin on the climb. Zakarin's advantage reached nearly two minutes before Tanel Kangert started the moves in the peloton. He quickly brought most of the general classification contenders with him before attacking once again. Pirazzi was eventually caught by the maglia rosa group as Zakarin continued to stay up front. With the gap at around a minute to Zakarin, Mikel Landa attacked out of the maglia rosa group. Maglia rosa wearer, Alberto Contador, tried to chase him but Landa managed to build a substantial gap on Contador's group. After a while, Ryder Hesjedal accelerated and he was quickly pursued by Steven Kruijswijk, Rigoberto Urán and Fabio Aru, while Contador struggled on the climb. Contador only had Kangert with him but Kangert attacked as well to keep Contador isolated. Up front, Landa was able to catch Zakarin with Landa taking the Cima Coppi at the summit of the Colle delle Finestre. Aru's group crossed the summit at nearly a minute behind Landa and Zakarin while Contador reached the summit a minute and a half behind.\nOn the descent, Contador managed to hold the gap at around a minute and a half. Meanwhile, up front, Zakarin refused to work with Landa, prompting Landa to wait for Aru's group. From behind, Contador managed to catch Kangert and he was able to cut the gap to the leading riders to under a minute. The leading riders eventually began to work together in a final chance to try and take the maglia rosa from Contador but despite the fact that their gap increased over Contador, they were not able to really threaten Contador's lead. With around left, Aru attacked in pursuit of the stage win. He was immediately chased by Urán but Aru continued to build his gap. Aru eventually took his second successive stage win, his team's fifth of the race as he finished 18 seconds ahead of Hesjedal, who passed Urán on the finish. Urán finished the stage, 24 seconds behind Aru with Landa and Kruijswijk finishing in fourth and fifth, respectively while Contador, pumping his fist, crossed the line 2' 25\" behind Aru. Hesjedal's ride moved him inside the top 5 of the general classification and Kruijswijk's ride allowed him to move up two spots to seventh overall. Although Contador lost two-and-a-half minutes on what he described as an \"off-day\", he kept the maglia rosa with a lead of 2' 02\" and with just a flat stage remaining, he was on the cusp of winning his second Giro d'Italia.\nStage 21.\nThe final stage of the race saw the race finish in Milan for the first time since 2012. There were no categorised climbs on the route so it was expected that the pure sprinters would battle it out for the stage win. The course ended with seven laps of a circuit. Barring any disasters, it was expected that Alberto Contador would cross the finish line of the stage as the winner of the Giro d'Italia and it was also expected that Giovanni Visconti and Fabio Aru would confirm their wins in the mountains and young rider classifications, respectively. However, the points classification was to be decided during the stage.\nAs expected, no riders went into the breakaway for almost the first half of the stage. into the stage, the first attacks were made as three riders, Philippe Gilbert, Silvan Dillier and Marcus Burghardt and 's Maximiliano Richeze pulled out a gap of around a minute. Gilbert's goal during the stage was to take the points classification and he managed to get closer to that goal as he won the first intermediate sprint. The four riders eventually took it easy as they waited for the peloton to catch up to them. After the quartet were caught, riders, Axel Domont and Patrick Gretsch attacked as well but they were immediately caught by the -led peloton. With setting a fast pace, no attacks were successful until after the first of seven laps of the circuit in Milan when 's Iljo Keisse and 's Luke Durbridge attacked the peloton.\nThe duo were able to build a gap of around 40 seconds with other teams in the peloton contributing to the chase. Along the way, 's Luka Mezgec and 's Leopold König suffered punctures as the duo up front continued to maintain their gap. After a while, Gilbert and 's Heinrich Haussler also suffered punctures as the leading duo kept their advantage at around 40 seconds. Several teams began contributing to the chase but the leading duo worked perfectly together as they held a pretty healthy gap on the peloton heading into the last kilometre of the stage. As the final kilometre wore on, Durbridge and Keisse began playing cat and mouse before Durbridge started his sprint first. However, Keisse came through to the front to take the stage win, his first victory in a Grand Tour. 's Roger Kluge led the peloton across the line, 9 seconds behind the duo while points classification leader, 's Giacomo Nizzolo, finished fifth on the stage to win the red jersey. Contador finished the stage safely to win his second Giro title while Aru and Visconti also finished safely to confirm their victories in the young rider classification and the mountains classification, respectively."

There is a specific reference to a \"Chatham Club\" in a description of a single wicket match in 1754.\nChatham lost by 20 runs to Meopham in June 1772 at George Louch's \"cricketing field\" in Chatham and in September 1772 the club played two matches against Dartford, the second one on Louch's field. Chatham won the first at Dartford by 19 runs and then Dartford won at Chatham, also by 19 runs. There are records of three matches against Bourne in 1773. The first at Bourne Paddock on Friday, 30 July 1773, was abandoned because of bad weather, Bourne won the second at Chatham on 30 and 31 August by 7 wickets and the third at Bourne on 6 and 7 September by 1 wicket.\nLouch's field was the club's venue in the early 1770s and there are references in 1785 and 1787 to Chatham Lines as a venue. In August 1787, a local match was played at \"The Star\" on Chatham Hill and this venue is mentioned several times in reports to 1791, especially for single wicket contests.\nThere are few mentions of a Chatham team after 1773 and the last 18th century reference concerns a minor match against local opposition in June 1800. CricketArchive lists two \"odds\" matches played by Chatham against the All-England Eleven in September 1861 and Kent County Cricket Club in August 1862. Both matches were played on Chatham Lines and the local club had 22 players against 11. Chatham also played the touring South Africans in June 1894. This was an eleven-a-side match which the South Africans won by five runs.\nThe Chatham Club ultimately folded and there is no modern equivalent in Kent league cricket."

        "text": "The England cricket team have appeared in every edition of the Cricket World Cup to date, being crowned champions in 2019. In addition, they were losing finalists in 1979, 1987 and 1992. England have been eliminated from the tournament in the group stage on five occasions (1999, 2003, 2007, 2015 and 2023)\nEngland were the inaugural hosts of the World Cup, in 1975. The country has since hosted the tournament a further four times; in 1979, 1983, 1999 and 2019, the most of any country.\n1975 World Cup.\nThe inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time, The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls. England won all their group stage matches but lost in their semi-final match against Australia.\nIn the semi-final, England were reduced to 37/7, as Gary Gilmour took 6/14, the best World Cup bowling figures at the time They were eventually bowled out for 93 in 36.2 overs. Australia initially suffered a collapse just as dramatic, falling to 39/6, before Gary Gilmour scored 28 from 28 balls, to help Australia to victory.\n1979 World Cup.\nThe 1979 Cricket World Cup was once again held in England. England won all of their group matches, and defeated New Zealand in a close semi-final by 9 runs. In the final, they lost to the West Indies.\nIn the semi-final, England began badly, falling to 38/2, before Mike Brearley (53 from 115 balls) and Graham Gooch (71 from 84 balls) resurrected the innings. Derek Randall (42 from 50 balls) scored quickly in the second half of the innings, and 25 runs from the last 3 overs of the innings saw England reach 221/8 from their 60 overs. In response, New Zealand reached 47 from 16 overs, before Bruce Edgar was out lbw. John Wright top-scored with 69 from 137 balls, before being run out. However, New Zealand continued to lose wickets, and they required 14 runs from the last over of the match, and England won by 9 runs, at the time the smallest winning margin by runs in World Cup matches.\nIn the final, the West Indies got off to a bad start, falling to 99/4. However, a \"match winning performance\" of 138 from 157 balls from Vivian Richards, and an aggressive innings from Collis King (86 from 66 balls) consolidated the innings with a 139 run partnership, as the West Indies scored 286/9 from 60 overs. In reply, the English openers, Mike Brearley (64 from 130 balls) and Geoff Boycott (57 from 105 balls), scored very slowly. They put together a very methodical opening partnership of 129 runs in 38 overs, but by the time both batsmen were out, the run rate had risen too high. Graham Gooch played some hefty strokes in scoring his 32, taking England to 183/2. However, the loss of Gooch triggered the biggest collapse in World Cup history, as England lost 8/11; Joel Garner took 5/3 in 11 balls. They were eventually all out for 194 in 51 overs.\n1983 World Cup.\nEngland were the host nation for the third consecutive tournament. They won 5 of their 6 group stage matches, losing against New Zealand, and qualified for the semi-final. In the semi-final, they were defeated by India \"with great ease\".\nIn the semi-final, England batted first, and reached 69 before losing opener Chris Tavaré. Medium pacer Mohinder Amarnath and off-spinner Kirti Azad helped slow the scoring rate, as England only managed 213 from their 60 overs. In reply, Yashpal Sharma (61 from 115 balls) and Sandeep Patil (51 from 32 balls) made half-centuries, and Amarnath and Yashpal's managed a 92 run partnership. India reached their target in 54.4 overs, winning the match by 6 wickets.\n1987 World Cup.\nThe 1987 Cricket World Cup was the first tournament not held in England. England matched their previous best performance, by reaching the final before losing to Australia.\nIn the semi-final, India chose to field first. After reaching 79/2, Graham Gooch (115 from 136 balls) and captain Mike Gatting (56 from 62 balls) shared a partnership of 117 runs in 19 overs. In the end, England reached 254/6 from their 50 overs. In reply, India made a bad start, and were 73/3. The middle order were more fluent, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls) top scoring. When Azharuddien was dismissed, India were 204/5 from 41 overs, and required 51 from 9 overs with 5 wickets in hand. However, they collapsed and were all out for 219 in 45.3 overs.\nIn the final, Australia won the toss and chose to bat. David Boon (75 from 125 balls, 7 fours) top-scored for Australia, Helped by Mike Veletta (45 from 31 balls), Australia scored 65 runs from the last 6 overs of their innings, and posted 253/5 from their 50 overs. England opener Tim Robinson was out lbw for a first ball duck. Bill Athey (58 from 103 balls) top-scored, and England were almost on target. However, when captain Mike Gatting (41 from 45 balls) was out playing an attempted reverse sweep off the occasional off-spin bowling of Allan Border, this ended a growing partnership of 69 runs in 13 overs between him and Bill Athey. Allan Lamb's innings of 45 from 55 balls was insufficient, as the required run-rate for England began to rise, requiring 17 off the last over, and eventually losing by 7 runs.\nSquad.\nSource:\n1992 World Cup.\nEngland reached their third World Cup final, and again lost in the final, this time to Pakistan. England won 5 of their 8 pool stage matches, with 1 no result, and easily qualified for the semi-final, despite a surprising lost to Zimbabwe in their final group match. Their semi-final was memorable due to a target recalculation under the most productive overs rule which removed any chance for South Africa to win the match. Despite being favourites to win the final, England lost to Pakistan, their third World Cup Final defeat.\nThe semi final between South Africa and England ended in controversial circumstances when, after a 10-minute rain delay, the most productive overs method revised South Africa's target from 22 runs from 13 balls to an impossible 21 runs from one ball.&lt;ref name=\"SkyD/L\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the World Cup, ODIs used a different formula as a result of this incident, and it was eventually superseded by the Duckworth–Lewis method for the 1999 World Cup. According to the late Bill Frindall, had the Duckworth–Lewis method been applied at that rain interruption, the revised target would have been four runs to tie or five to win from the final ball.\nEngland were favourites to win, having bowled out Pakistan for just 74 earlier in the tournament. A repeat looked possible when Derek Pringle dismissed both Pakistani openers, making the score 24/2. However, Imran Khan and Javed Miandad settled down to see off the new ball. A crucial moment occurred when Imran Khan was dropped by Graham Gooch at 9 runs. He later went on to score a match-winning 72. At the 25 over mark, Pakistan had only scored 70, but accelerated the score to 139 by the 31st over as Javed Miandad summoned a runner and Imran and him built a steady partnership. During his innings, Imran Khan hit a huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members' section. Imran went on to score 72 and Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give England a fighting target of 250. England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was dismissed for a duck by Wasim Akram, followed by Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother left Imran with no choice but to give an early second spell to his main pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote the fate of the match. Two magical deliveries from the great left-arm fast bowler showed Allan Lamb and the dangerous Chris Lewis the pavilion door. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off Aaqib Javed to seal England's last hope. When the cards were laid down, Captain Imran Khan had the last laugh when end man Richard Illingworth was caught by Ramiz Raja off his delivery to finish off the final and crown Pakistan World Cup winners.\nSquad.\nSource:\n1996 World Cup.\nEngland reached the quarter-finals of the 1996 Cricket World Cup, before being eliminated by Sri Lanka.\nSquad.\nSource:\n1999 World Cup.\nEngland hosted the 1999 Cricket World Cup, although some matches were played in Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands. After defeats to South Africa and India, England failed to progress to the Knockout stage of the tournament, for the first time in the tournament history.\nSquad.\nSource:\n2003 World Cup.\nEngland forfeited their first match against Zimbabwe due to security concerns in Zimbabwe. Of the remaining 5 games, they won 3, but for the second consecutive World Cup, England failed to progress from the group stage.\nSquads.\nSource:\n2007 World Cup.\nAfter failing to progress from the group stage at the 1999 and 2003 World Cups, England managed to progress to the Super 8 stage of the tournament, by winning both their matches against Associate Nations. In the Super 8 stage, they were eliminated, beating Ireland, Bangladesh and West Indies but losing to 4 other Test-playing nations.\nIn their opening match, England lost Ed Joyce for a duck off the first legitimate delivery of the match, and only Paul Nixon and Liam Plunkett, the numbers eight and nine, managed a strike rate above 70. With the fall of Paul Collingwood at the end of 35th over, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming brought on Shane Bond, and he removed Kevin Pietersen, England's top-scorer, and Andrew Flintoff in the same over. Jamie Dalrymple followed three overs later, as England had lost four wickets for five runs, but Nixon and Plunkett batted out the remaining 12 overs, making 71. In reply, New Zealand lost two wickets in eight balls to James Anderson and Liam Plunkett, and also had captain Fleming back for a single-figure score. However, from then on they made 191 for the loss of only one wicket, Craig McMillan caught off Monty Panesar's bowling. Scott Styris and Jacob Oram added an unbeaten 138 for the fifth wicket, just ten runs off the New Zealand record from the 1999 World Cup, resulting in a man-of-the-match award for Styris.\nTheir final match against Kenya was effectively a playoff match against the 2003 semi-finalists. Ed Joyce's second fifty in as many matches helped England qualify for the Super Eights. Steve Tikolo came in at four after James Anderson had removed both openers, and though he made his 20th half-century, none of his team-mates passed 20. Extras were the second-highest contributor, with six wides and eight no-balls, most of the latter coming from Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff, who bowled three no-balls each. Flintoff did get Tikolo out with a yorker, while three of Kenya's players were run out as they were bowled out on the last ball of the rain-reduced innings. Kenya's opening bowler Peter Ongondo extracted \"tennis-ball bounce\" to remove Michael Vaughan for one with the 19th ball of the game; however, despite Ian Bell getting caught for 16, England had reduced the equation to 126 off 34.2 overs after Joyce and Bell's partnership. With Kevin Pietersen also getting a fifty, England made it through with ten overs to spare.\nIn their first Super 8 match, England won the toss and batted first, but lost both openers to Boyd Rankin in six overs, before Ian Bell spent 74 balls making his 31. When Bell got out, the run rate was slightly above 4; in the final 28 overs, it was in excess of 6, with Paul Collingwood making 90, Kevin Pietersen 48 and Andrew Flintoff 43. Kyle McCallan was the most economical bowler for Ireland, and also took the wicket of Pietersen. Chasing 267 in reply, Niall O'Brien's third One-day International fifty and his second of the World Cup helped Ireland to a total of 139 for six in the 37th over, but despite faster than a run a ball scores from Trent Johnston and Andrew White Ireland fell 48 runs short as Andrew Flintoff took the final two wickets, though they exceeded their previous World Cup record total by seven runs.\nSquad.\nSource:&lt;br&gt;\nNote: On 4 April 2007, Lewis was withdrawn from the squad for personal reasons. Stuart Broad replaced him.\n2011 World Cup.\nIn the group stages, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh. However, a victory against South Africa and a tie against eventual winners India helped England progress to the quarter-finals, where they lost to Sri Lanka.\nEngland's opening match was against the Netherlands. Batting first, the Netherlands scored 292, the second highest score from an Associate nation playing against a Test nation, helped by a Ryan ten Doeschate century, and late innings acceleration to score 104 runs off the last ten overs of the innings. In reply, England started wrongly, reaching 100/0 at a run a ball, before losing Kevin Pietersen. England captain Andrew Strauss fell just short of a century, and all the England top order batsmen scored runs, with Paul Collingwood and Ravi Bopara taking England home with 1.2 overs to spare.\nIndia batted first and opener Sachin Tendulkar scored his 47th ODI century and 5th World Cup century, the highest number of centuries by anyone ever in a World Cup. Support came from Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh who both made half-centuries. Tim Bresnan took his first five-wicket haul in ODI matches, which included three wickets with four balls in the 49th over. Chasing 339 to win, Andrew Strauss made his highest score in ODI cricket, with 158, before being dismissed by Zaheer Khan. Ian Bell survived an earlier LBW appeal, after it was referred via the DRS system. After a collapse from England, Graeme Swann scored one run off the final ball, tying the match.\nAgainst Ireland, England batted first with Jonathan Trott top-scoring, with 92 from 92 balls. England batsmen Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell also hit half-centuries, with Trott and Bell sharing a 177 run partnership. England finished on 327/8 from their 50 overs, having only scored 33 runs from their last 5 overs. In reply, Ireland lost their captain, William Porterfield in the very first ball, and were struggling at 111/5 after 25 overs. Kevin O'Brien came in with the score at 106/4, and made 113 in just 63 balls, including the fastest century in World Cup history, as Ireland won the match by 3 wickets, with five balls to spare. It was the largest successful run chase in Cricket World Cup history.\nAgainst South Africa, England batted first and lost the wickets of Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen in the first over. Jonathan Trott and Ravi Bopara put on a partnership worth 99 runs, but England finished all out for 171, with four overs still remaining. In reply, South Africa reached 124 with the loss of just three wickets, but then lost the next four wickets inside five overs for three runs. Stuart Broad took the final two wickets, to give England victory by six runs.\nBangladesh's score was at one point 169/8 but tail ender 58 run partnership brought victory for the team. Bangladesh's win in this match was only their second against England in a total of 15 ODIs.\nTheir final group match was against the West Indies, and England had to win the game to have any realistic chance of going through to the quarter finals. England chose to bat, and started quickly thanks to Jonathan Trott, who scored 47; they were 94/2 from 15 overs. However, they crumbled in the middle overs, and ended up being bowled out for 243. In reply, Chris Gayle started quickly, including 18 off a Chris Tremlett over, before being dismissed in the seventh over. The West Indies were reduced to 150-6, before a seventh-wicket partnership of 72 between Ramnaresh Sarwan and Andre Russell helped the West Indies reach 222-6 at the end of the 42nd over. However Tredwell and Swann took 3 wickets, and Trott ran out Sulieman Benn, as the West Indies were all out for 225.\nIn the quarter-final, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga both made centuries as Sri Lanka chased down a target of 230 to win by ten wickets; this run chase set a new record for the highest successful run chase in a ten-wicket victory in ODI history.\nSquad.\nSource:&lt;br&gt;\nNotes: \n2015 World Cup.\nEngland failed to beat any Test-playing nations at the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Although they beat Associate nations Scotland and Afghanistan, this was not enough to qualify for the Knockout stage. This was the third time that they had not progressed from the group stage.\nEngland's fixtures began with 2 games against co-hosts Australia and New Zealand- they lost both. They reduced Australia to 52/2, and 70/3 in the 11th over. Stand-in captain George Bailey and Aaron Finch then put together a 146 run-partnership in 26 overs, and Australia accelerated their scoring rate with Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh and Brad Haddin. Despite a hat-trick from Steven Finn with the last three balls of the innings, Australia finished at 342/9. In reply, England were reduced to 92/6. Despite a 92-run partnership between James Taylor and Chris Woakes, England found themselves at 195/9. They eventually reached 231, before James Anderson was incorrectly given run out; Taylor finished on 98*, and England lost by 111 runs.\nEngland's next match was against the other co-hosts, New Zealand. After electing to bat first, England were bowled out for 123 in the 34th over, having lost their last seven wickets for 19 runs in eight overs. New Zealand fast bowler Tim Southee picked up 7/33 in his 9 overs, which was the third-best haul in World Cup history. In reply, New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum scored the fastest World Cup fifty reaching the landmark in just 18 balls, \nand New Zealand were 105/0 after 7 overs. McCullum was dismissed off the first ball of the eighth over for 77, and the other opener, Martin Guptill also fell to the bowling of Chris Woakes in the tenth over. New Zealand consolidated the innings following this and went on to win the game by 8 wickets with more than 37 overs to spare.\nAfter 2 heavy defeats, England looked to bounce back against Scotland, who were the lowest ranked team in the Group, and had never beaten England in an ODI. Batting first, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell put on an opening partnership of 172. However, in the first 3 overs of the batting powerplay England lost 3 wickets for 2 runs, including top-scorer Moeen Ali, and despite a 49 run partnership between Eoin Morgan and James Taylor and a 45 run partnership between Morgan and Jos Buttler, England only reached 309/8, with just 131 runs scored in the last 20 overs. In reply, Scotland started confidently with Kyle Coetzer (71) sharing an early 60 run partnership with Preston Mommsen. However, after Mommsen's dismissal, Scotland continued to lose wickets throughout the innings, including Steven Finn dismissing Coetzer for 71. Eventually, they lost their last 7 wickets for 70 runs, with 6 batsmen scoring fewer than 10 runs, as Scotland were bowled out for 184, and England won by 119 runs.\nEngland's match against Sri Lanka was the chance to get a first win against a Test-playing nation in the tournament. However, from 62/0, their innings was reduced to 101/3 in the 21st over. Joe Root and Morgan added 60 runs for the fourth wicket before the dismissal of Morgan. The fifth-wicket partnership between Root and James Taylor yielded 98 runs in 11 overs. Taylor fell for 25, following which Root was also dismissed for a 108-ball 121. England were 265/6 in the 47th over, before Jos Buttler struck an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls to take the total to 309/6 at the end of 50 overs. Sri Lankan innings began with Lahiru Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Tillakaratne Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Kumar Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory.\nWith just 1 win in 4 matches, England entered this match knowing that they had to win in order to avoid being eliminated. After being put into bat, Bangladesh were 8/2, and later 99/4. However, a 141-run partnership between Mahmudullah Riyad and Mushfiqur Rahim (the highest partnership for Bangladesh in a World Cup match) helped Bangladesh reach 275/7, their highest score against England in ODI cricket. Mahmudullah Riyad became the first player to score a century for Bangladesh in a World Cup match. England started well, reaching 97/1, including a 54-run partnership between Ian Bell and Alex Hales. However, England then collapsed to 132/5 10 overs later, with the collapse led by Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. When Joe Root was caught behind, England needed 113 to win from 14 overs. Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes put on 75 runs for the seventh wicket, but Buttler fell for 65, and England were ultimately bowled out for 260.\nIn their last game, England beat Afghanistan in a rain-affected match.\nSquad.\nSource:\n2019 World Cup.\nEngland and Wales hosted the 2019 edition of the World Cup, making it the fifth time the tournament has been held within the country. England entered the tournament as favourites, having been ranked the number one ODI side by the ICC for over a year prior to the tournament.\nEngland began their campaign on 30 May in the opening match of the tournament against South Africa at The Oval. England batted first and, despite losing opener Jonny Bairstow for a golden duck to the second ball of the tournament, went on to score 311/8, with Ben Stokes top-scoring with 89 runs. In reply, South Africa were bowled out for 207, which included a collapse of eight wickets for 78 runs, to give England victory by 104 runs.\nThe next match saw the hosts suffer a shock defeat to Pakistan at Trent Bridge. After England won the toss and elected to field, Pakistan scored 348/8, with Mohammad Hafeez making 84. England managed a score of 334/9, losing by 14 runs despite centuries from both Joe Root (107) and Jos Buttler (103) with a substantial 130-run partnership for the fourth wicket.\nAgainst Bangladesh at Sophia Gardens, England were put in to bat and made a total of 386/6, Jason Roy scoring 153 from 121 deliveries. Bangladesh were subsequently all out for 280 after Shakib Al Hasan scored 121, England winning by 106 runs.\nEngland next travelled to Hampshire to face the West Indies at the Hampshire Bowl. England were able to restrict the West Indies to 212 after winning the toss and choosing to field, with Mark Wood taking figures of 3/18. An unbeaten hundred from Joe Root took England to a comfortable eight-wicket win with over 16 overs remaining.\nAgainst Afghanistan at Old Trafford, England set a target of 397/6, their highest ever World Cup total. Eoin Morgan scored 148 runs from 78 balls, including 17 sixes, a record for an individual innings in an ODI. England also surpassed their own record for the most sixes by a team in an ODI, with 25. In Afghanistan's innings, they could only manage 247/8, handing England a comfortable victory by 150 runs.\nBowling first in their next match against Sri Lanka at Headingley, England required a total of 233 runs to win after Sri Lanka finished their innings with 232/9, Angelo Mathews scoring an unbeaten 85. However, England struggled against Lasith Malinga as they were bowled out for 212 in reply, Malinga taking 4/43 as England suffered another shock defeat by 20 runs. Ben Stokes provided England with some hope of a victory, finishing on 82 not out."

        "title": "List of unusual dismissals in international cricket",
        "text": "In cricket, a player is dismissed when they lose their wicket. At this point, the batsman must discontinue batting and leave the field permanently. A batsman can be dismissed in a number of ways, the most common being bowled, caught, leg before wicket (LBW), stumped, run out and hit wicket. Much rarer are hit the ball twice, obstructing the field, retired out and timed out. These are regarded by analysts as unusual ways of dismissals in cricket, where the bowler is denied any credit. Handled the ball was a previously a separate method of dismissal, now incorporated into obstructing the field. As of November 2023, there have been twenty-eight instances of players being dismissed unusually in international cricket: ten in Test cricket, twelve in One Day Internationals (ODIs), four in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) and two in Women's One Day International cricket.\nTest cricket.\nIn Tests, England batsman Leonard Hutton was the first player to be dismissed for obstructing the field, while playing against South Africa in August 1951. Between January 1957 and March 2001, six different players were dismissed for handling the ball, the most common form of an unusual dismissal. Sri Lanka cricketers Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene are the only Test players to be dismissed retired out, when playing against Bangladesh in 2001. Sri Lanka's captain, Sanath Jayasuriya, received strong criticism for the team's act.\nRussell Endean, the South African wicketkeeper, was involved in both of the first two unusual dismissials. First came his involvement in Len Hutton's \"obstructing the field\" dismissal: Endean was prevented from attempting a catch, when Hutton used his bat to prevent the ball landing on his stumps after he had edged it up in the air. (Guarding his stumps being the only circumstance in which a ball can legally be hit twice: so Hutton came close to that form of dismissal too, if the umpire had ruled that the ball was not in fact headed towards the wicket.) Six years later, in similar circumstances after edging the ball up in the air and seeing it drop towards his stumps, Endean used his free hand instead of his bat to intercept the ball, and was given out \"handled ball\". The second \"handled ball\" dismissal was more unfortunate: Andrew Hilditch, at the non-striker's end, picked up the stationary ball to hand it back to a fielder, the only instance of a non-striker suffering this dismissal. All subsequent instances of \"handled the ball\" have been more similar to Endean's, with a batsman using his free hand to guard his stumps.\nIn December 2023, Mushfiqur Rahim became the first person in test cricket to be dismissed for obstructing the field since the rule for handling the ball was subsumed into this law in October 2017.\nMen's One Day International cricket.\nIn men's ODIs, eleven players have been dismissed on twelve occasions in an unusual manner. The first such occasion was when India's Mohinder Amarnath was given out for handling the ball, against Australia in February 1986. The following year, Pakistan cricketer Rameez Raja became the first player to be given out for obstructing the field in ODIs: with the match lost, but himself on a score of 98, he attempted two runs off the final ball and used his bat to deliberately block a run-out attempt when going for the second run that would have got him a century. In 1989, Amarnath was dismissed in a similar fashion, kicking the ball away to prevent a run-out attempt, while playing in a match against Sri Lanka, thus becoming the first player to be dismissed by two different unusual methods. Obstructing the field has been the most common method of unusual dismissal in men's ODIs, happening on eight of the twelve occasions. \nSri Lanka's Angelo Mathews was the only cricketer to be dismissed Timed out in international cricket when he was dismissed in such a manner during a group stage match against Bangladesh in 2023 Cricket World Cup.\nT20I cricket.\nThe first instance of an unusual dismissal in T20Is occurred in June 2017, when England's Jason Roy was given out obstructing the field in a match against South Africa.\nWomen's ODI cricket.\nIn international women's cricket, there have been two instances of unusual dismissals: the first came in an ODI match between Sri Lanka and the West Indies in April 2010. Sri Lanka wicket-keeper Dilani Manodara was retired out due to her slow scoring rate in her team's first innings, having taken 70 minutes and 39 balls to score 8 runs. The most recent instance of an unusual dismissal happened when India's Thirush Kamini was given out for obstructing the field in a match against West Indies in 2016."

        "title": "Alpine climbing",
        "text": "Alpine climbing () is a type of mountaineering that involves using any of a broad range of advanced climbing skills, including rock climbing, ice climbing, and/or mixed climbing, to summit typically large routes (e.g. multi-pitch or big wall) in an alpine environment. While alpine climbing began in the European Alps, it is used to refer to climbing in any remote mountainous area, including in the Himalayas and in Patagonia. The derived term alpine style refers to the fashion of alpine climbing to be in small lightly-equipped teams who carry all of their own equipment (e.g. no porters), and do all of the climbing (e.g. no sherpas or reserve teams).\nAlpinists face a wide range of serious risks in addition to the specific risks of rock, ice, and mixed climbing. This includes the risks of rockfalls (common with rock faces in alpine environments), avalanches (especially in couloirs), seracs and crevasses, violent storms hitting climbers on exposed mountain faces, altitude effects (dehydration, edema, frostbite), complex navigation and route finding, long abseils, and the difficulty of rescue and/or retreat due to the remote setting. Due to the scale of the routes, alpine climbers need to be able to move together for speed (e.g. simul climbing or as rope teams), which is another source of specific risk. \nThe first \"golden age\" of modern alpine climbing was the first free ascents–in summer, in winter, and as solo–of the great north faces of the Alps by pioneers such as Walter Bonatti, Riccardo Cassin and Gaston Rebuffat. The subsequent era, which is still ongoing, is focused on the equivalent ascents and enchainments, of the ice and snow-covered faces and ridges of major Himalayan peaks (e.g. the eight-thousanders, Latok, The Ogre) and Patagonian peaks (e.g. Cerro Torre Group, Fitz Roy Group) in \"alpine style\" by pioneers such as Hermann Buhl, Reinhold Messner and Doug Scott, and latterly by alpinists such as Ueli Steck, Mick Fowler, Paul Ramsden, and Marko Prezelj. The annual Piolets d'Or are awarded for the best achievements in alpine climbing.\nDescription.\nAlpine climbing involves small unsupported teams tackling large multi-pitch (or big wall) routes that can involve various combinations of rock climbing, ice climbing, and mixed climbing, in alpine-type mountain environments. Alpine routes are often long and require a full day of climbing or even several days. Because of the length of the routes, and the danger of alpine environments (e.g. rockfall, avalanche, altitude, weather, etc.), alpine climbers (or \"alpinists\") typically try routes that are well within their technical rock, ice, or mixed climbing capabilities.\nWhile parts of an alpine route will involve a lead climber tackling difficult rock, ice, or mixed sections while being belayed by a stationary second climber below, parts will involve both climbers moving simultaneously together, particularly on large snow slopes or easier rock sections. Simultaneous climbing (or simul climbing) is riskier but is necessary to ensure that the climbers can move quickly through what is often a very dangerous and exposed environment (e.g. rockfall on open ice fields), and complete the routes in a reasonable time.\nAlpine climbing can involve aid climbing, particularly if high up on a route, aid is needed to make progress and avoid a dangerous retreat. It can also involve multiple and complex abseils, either on the descent or in a retreat from a route. Classic alpine climbing routes often take at least a full day of climbing which necessitates the early \"alpine start\" (and helps to avoid the afternoon rockfalls), and may force a bivouac. It often involves traveling on glaciers and bergschrunds to get to and from the route (and in the dark for \"alpine starts\").\nDue to the greater complexity and risks of alpine climbing, alpinists need to be much more familiar with and confident in each team member's abilities and skill level. Alpine climbing involves exercising judgment and decision-making to adapt to the constantly changing alpine weather and route conditions, where good initial progress can quickly turn into a fight for the team's survival (e.g. the famous 1936 Eiger climbing disaster). \n\"Alpine style\".\nThe derived term \"alpine style\" alludes to the fashion of alpine climbing to be in small fast-moving teams – or even solo – who carry all of their own equipment (e.g. no porters), and do all of the climbing (e.g. no sherpas or reserve teams laying down fixed ropes). \"Alpine-style\" is the opposite of expedition style (which is sometimes pejoratively called \"siege style\"), and is often considered a \"purer\" form of climbing.\n\"Alpine style\" also means being \"lightly equipped\" with for example no supplementary oxygen, no major tenting or overnight equipment, and limited food and fuel supplies. It also means having no fixed ropes on the route (an important safety feature of expedition-style mountaineering). \nWhile these attributes enable alpine climbers to move quickly and take advantage of good conditions and \"weather windows\", it also makes alpine climbing far more dangerous. In situations where the habitually unstable high-altitude weather turns, alpine climbers will not have the provisions to \"sit out\" the storm, and will not have the fixed ropes in place to retreat safely and quickly; such forced retreats in poor conditions are dangerous.\nEquipment.\nWhile alpine climbers are \"lightly equipped\" due to the fact that they must carry all of their equipment while climbing, the range of climbing equipment needed can be considerable due to the diverse range of climbing techniques required on major alpine routes, and the harsh conditions encountered. \nRisks.\nAlpinists face a number of additional risks to the risks of rock climbing, ice climbing, and mixed climbing, making it one of the most dangerous forms of climbing. In 2019, Francis Sanzaro writing in the \"New York Times\" said of modern alpinism: \"The routes are becoming more technically demanding, in more remote areas, and the method of \"light and fast\" — minimal gear, no fixed ropes, doing the route in a single push — is now regarded as the best style. These trends, and others, have made the sport of alpine climbing very, very dangerous\". In 2021, the \"New York Times\" called the Piolets d'Or, alpine climbing's most important award, \"A Climbing Award That May Be a Winner’s Last\", due to the number of fatalities of past winners.\nAdditional risks faced by alpinists to the risks of rock climbing, ice climbing, and mixed climbing, are:\nGrading.\nDue to the complexity of routes in alpine climbing, the \"overall\" grade denotes the general level of seriousness of the route to which is added additional specific grade(s) for any rock climbing (usually the French, American, or UIAA grades for free climbing, and the A-grade for aid climbing), ice climbing (the WI-grade), and mixed climbing (the M-grade) involved. In addition, alpine grades will quote the inclination of the main snow slopes encountered (e.g. 50–60 degrees), as these are often not graded ice climbs, but contribute significantly to the overall risk. \nThe most widely used \"overall\" grades are the acronyms of the UIAA Scale of Overall Difficulty, also known as the International French Adjectival System (IFAS). The UIAA warns against aligning their acronyms with equivalent rock and ice climbing grades, as the objective dangers can vary dramatically on routes with similar rock and ice climbing grades. For example, the famous 1,800-metre \"Eiger North Face 1938 Heckmair Route\" is graded ED2 even though the rock climbing is graded UIAA V− and the ice climbing is only at 60 degrees (i.e. both typically a D grade), due to the exceptional length and danger of the route. In spite of this, attempts have been made to ascribe a \"typical\" range of rock and ice climbing grades for to each acronym: \nNote: A \"+\" (pronounced \"Sup\" for \"supérieur\") or a \"−\" (pronounced \"Inf\" for \"inférieur\") is placed after the acronym to indicate if a climb is at the lower or upper end of that grade (e.g., a climb slightly harder than \"PD+\" might be \"AD−\"). The term ABO for \"abominable\" is explicitly not recognized by the UIAA.\nMilestones.\nThe following are the most notable milestones in alpine climbing (and latterly, alpine-style climbing as applied worldwide):\nIn film.\nA number of notable climbing films have been made about alpine climbing (and alpine climbing routes), including:"

It is based on the List of Test cricket records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the New Zealand Test cricket team, and any cricketers who have played for that team.\nNew Zealand took part in their first recognised Test cricket match against England in the 1929/30 season, and the records listed here date from that time.\n New Zealand won the inaugural ICC World Test Championship, beating India in the final by 8 wickets.

This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by innings).\nThe fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket history.

The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama against India in 1997. New Zealand's Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe hold the third highest Test partnership with 467 made in 1991 against Sri Lanka.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most Test matches umpired with 130. The current active Dar set the record in December 2019 overtaking Steve Bucknor from the West Indies mark of 128 matches. They are followed by South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108."

        "text": "The 2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on Monday, April 4, 2016, at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, between the Villanova Wildcats and the \nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nThe first half was closely fought, with neither team leading by more than five points in the first 19 minutes. After North Carolina briefly took a seven-point lead in the final minute, a field goal by Phil Booth for Villanova cut the lead to 39–34 at the break. Villanova started to gain the upper hand in the second half, taking their largest lead of the game, 67–57, with 4:47 remaining. North Carolina then surged back, setting up a heroic comeback in the final minutes. With just over 1:30 remaining, Marcus Paige hit a three pointer to cut the lead to three points. After Villanova turned over the ball, Brice Johnson cut the lead to one point. Booth was fouled and hit two free throws to retake a three-point lead. With 13 seconds remaining, the lead was again three points for Villanova. On the ensuing possession, Paige sunk an off-balance three-point field goal to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left. However, Ryan Arcidiacono found Kris Jenkins for a buzzer-beating, championship-winning three-point shot, with Villanova defeating North Carolina by a final score of 77–74. It was Villanova's second title overall, and first since 1985. Jenkins's buzzer beater is considered to be one of the greatest shots in NCAA tournament history.\nParticipants.\nVillanova Wildcats.\nAfter a 27–4 regular season and winning the 2016 Big East Conference regular season championship, Villanova beat Georgetown and Providence en route to the 2016 Big East tournament finals, where they would lose to Seton Hall. They were the #2 seed in the South Regional of the 2016 NCAA Tournament.\nVillanova cruised past UNC Asheville in the first round of the tournament with an 86–56 victory. In the second round, Villanova routed Iowa by a score of 87–68 to reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2009. In the South Regional semifinals, Villanova blew out Miami by a score of 92–69. In the South regional Final, with Villanova leading 62–59, Mikal Bridges made a steal before Frank Mason III could shoot a potential game-tying three-pointer, and Jalen Brunson made the ensuing free throws and Villanova beat the #1-overall seed Kansas 64–59 to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 2009. In the Final Four, Villanova defeated Oklahoma, 95–51, the largest margin of victory in Final Four history, to advance to the national championship game for the first time since their 1985 National Championship run. The game also featured the second-best shooting percentage in a Final Four game, behind only Villanova's 1985 Championship Game performance of 78.6% (22-for-28).\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nAfter a 25–6 regular season and winning the 2016 ACC regular season championship, North Carolina beat Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, and Virginia en route to the ACC tournament championship. They were rewarded with the top seed in the East Regional of the 2016 NCAA Tournament.\nNorth Carolina opened the tournament with an 83–67 win over Florida Gulf Coast, outscoring FGCU 42–27 in the second half. North Carolina would again use a big second half to beat Providence, 85–66, in the second round, outscoring the Friars 51–36 in the second half to advance to the Sweet 16. In the Sweet 16, Marcus Paige would have 21 points and Brice Johnson would have 20 points to power UNC to a 101–86 victory over Indiana. In the Elite Eight, North Carolina beat fellow ACC foe Notre Dame, 88–74, to advance to an NCAA Tournament-record 19th Final Four. In the Final Four, North Carolina beat another ACC foe, Syracuse, 83–66, to make their 10th appearance in the National Title game in hopes of winning their sixth national title. UNC became one of only four schools to do so, along with Duke, UCLA, and Kentucky.\nGame summary.\nThe first half of the National Championship game was tightly fought, with neither team taking a lead larger than five points in the first 19 minutes. In the last minute of the half, North Carolina briefly went up by seven points, and had a chance to go up by nine. However, Villanova's Josh Hart blocked a layup attempt, which led to a Phil Booth jump shot at the other end of the court, cutting the deficit to 39–34 as the clock expired. At halftime, Joel Berry II of the Tar Heels led all players with 15 points. Despite entering the game ranked only 294th out of all 351 Division I teams in three-point shooting, North Carolina hit seven of their nine three-point attempt in the first half. However, the Tar Heels hit just 32% of their two-point attempts. Villanova had the edge in points the paint by an 18–12 margin, connecting on 65% on their two-point shots. The Tar Heels led in fast break points by a 10–2 margin and collected five offensive rebounds compared to only one for Villanova. Villanova's Kris Jenkins played just four minutes in the half after getting into early foul trouble.\nAfter the halftime break, Villanova went on a 13–2 run and reclaimed the lead. With 6:13 left in the second half, Ryan Arcidiacono of the Wildcats hit a three-point field goal to give his team a lead of six points. With 4:47 to go, Villanova was up by a game-high 10 points, leading 67–57. However, North Carolina fought back with two straight field goals. With 1:38 remaining, Villanova led 70–64 before Marcus Paige of the Tar Heels hit a three-pointer to cut the lead in half. After a Villanova turnover, Brice Johnson hit a bank shot to cut the Wildcats' lead to one point. Phil Booth of the Wildcats was fouled by Isaiah Hicks with 35.7 seconds left. He hit both free throws to put the lead back to three points. Paige missed a layup attempt on the ensuing possession, but North Carolina got the rebound and Paige made a reverse layup to cut the lead back to one. Villanova's Josh Hart was then fouled and hit both free throws.\nDown by three points, North Carolina tied the game on an \"unbelievable\" double-clutch three-pointer by Paige with 4.7 seconds remaining. After the game, North Carolina Coach Roy Williams remarked \"he turned a broken play into a great play\". Villanova then called a time-out to set up their final play, one that they had practiced \"every single day\" during the season, called \"Nova\". After receiving the in-bounds pass, Arcidiacono passed with less than two seconds to Jenkins, who hit a game-winning, buzzer-beating three-point shot. It was the first buzzer-beating shot to win an NCAA men's national title since Lorenzo Charles' dunk for North Carolina State University in 1983, and the first title game ever to end on a buzzer-beating three-pointer. \"Kris Jenkins lives for that moment\", remarked his coach Jay Wright.\nPaige finished with a game-high 21 points and a game-high 6 assists for North Carolina. Berry added 20 points for the Tar Heels and Johnson scored 14 while collecting a game-high 8 rebounds. Booth came off the bench to lead Villanova with a career-high 20 points. Arcidiacono scored 16, Jenkins added 14, and Hart had 12 points and 8 rebounds. As a team, Villanova finished 28 of 48 from the field (58%) and 8 of 14 from three (57%). North Carolina made 11 of 17 three-point attempts (65%) and was 27 of 63 overall (43%). The Tar Heels won the rebounding battle 33–23, including 14 offensive rebounds to just two for Villanova. The teams combined for just 21 turnovers.\nIt was Villanova's second NCAA championship. Their first championship was in the 1985 Championship Game, when they defeated the Georgetown Hoyas in what is often considered one of the greatest upsets of all time. Rollie Massimino, the head coach of the 1985 Wildcats, was on hand to watch the 2016 Championship Game. The Wildcats finished the tournament with the third-largest average margin of victory in tournament history, behind the 1996 Kentucky team and the 2024 UConn team.\nReactions.\nIn his post-game press conference, Jay Wright remarked, \"That was one of the greatest college basketball games we've ever been a part of. I just couldn't be prouder, couldn't be happier to see them fulfill this. This is what it's all about as a coach\". He added, \"I can’t wait to see that look (on my face), because I was just shocked\" by the final play. \"We beat a class program. Great coach and great team. We have a lot of respect for North Carolina\". Roy Williams, who was in tears after the game, described his reaction as the final shot went in: \"It was helpless. It was not a good feeling\". He added, \"I'm not very good because I can't take away the hurt ... I told them I loved them. I told them I wish I could have helped them more\".\nCBS sportswriter Matt Norlander described the game as \"a thrilling, undeniably heart-stopping, instant classic of a title game\". ESPN staff writer Eamonn Brennan also called the game an \"instant classic\" and said both teams \"were flying around the floor, playing high-level, pinpoint basketball and trading great plays\". The Associated Press called the final basket \"as memorable as any [points] that have been scored in the history of this tournament\".\nWriting for \"USA Today\", Nicole Auerbach called Villanova's performance \"one of the most improbable and offensively insane NCAA tournament runs\", ending with \"one of the most thrilling championship games in tournament history\". Villanova's championship win was so unexpected that more contestants in ESPN's Tournament Challenge bracket contest picked Villanova to lose in the first round than picked them to win the championship.\nIn response to the historic win and to combat absenteeism the following day, classes at Villanova were cancelled.\nMedia coverage.\nThe National Championship game was broadcast in the United States by TBS, marking the first time that the national championship game aired exclusively on pay television, and ending a 34-year run on CBS (CBS and TBS will alternate broadcasting the championship game every other year through 2024; thus, the game returned to CBS for 2017). TBS's sister channels TNT and TruTV aired special broadcasts of the game known as \"Team Stream powered by Bleacher Report\", which featured commentators representing the two participating teams. These special telecasts had been used for the Final Four since they moved to TBS in 2014, but this marked the first time they were used for the national championship. On the main broadcast, Jim Nantz was on play-by-play, with Bill Raftery and Grant Hill providing on-court commentary. Tracy Wolfson was the on-court reporter. Craig Sager was also on hand, as he interviewed former North Carolina guard, Chicago Bulls legend, and Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan, who was in attendance. Greg Gumbel and Ernie Johnson served as the pregame hosts. Charles Barkley, Seth Davis, Reggie Miller, Clark Kellogg, Kenny Smith and Steve Smith provided commentary. TNT's \"Team Stream\", focusing on North Carolina, was called by Wes Durham with analyst Brendan Haywood and sideline reporter Dwayne Ballen, while on truTV's \"Team Stream\", which focused on Villanova, Scott Graham called the game with analyst Brian Finneran and sideline reporter Kacie McDonnell. When it was first revealed that TBS would air this game, some concerns arose as to whether the traditional closing song, \"One Shining Moment\", would be used due to its association with CBS, but TBS eventually played it to end the telecast, and continues to do so when it has the broadcasting rights to the Final Four and national championship.\nESPN International owned the international broadcast rights. Sean McDonough served as the play-by-play announcer for the international audience, with Dick Vitale providing commentary. In Canada, the game aired on TSN.\nRadio coverage in the United States was provided by Westwood One, with Kevin Kugler calling the game. The Championship Game was also streamed live on NCAA.com free of charge.\nWith the switch from broadcast television to cable television, ratings in the United States sharply declined from the 2015 title contest between Duke and Wisconsin. The three cable channels airing the game, TBS, TNT and TruTV, had a combined broadcast average of 17.8 million viewers. That total is down from the 28.3 million who watched the previous year's Championship Game, which aired exclusively on CBS."

        "title": "2015–16 Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2015–16 Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team (variously \"Alabama\", \"UA\", \"Bama\" or \"The Tide\") represented the University of Alabama in the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Crimson Tide played its home games at Coleman Coliseum in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as a member of the Southeastern Conference. Avery Johnson was in his inaugural season as head coach of the team. He was hired on April 6, 2015, to replace Anthony Grant, who was fired on March 15 after serving as Alabama's head coach for six seasons. The team finished the season 18–15, 8–10 in SEC play to finish in 10th place. They defeated Ole Miss in the second round of the SEC tournament to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Kentucky. The Crimson Tide received an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament as a #5 seed, where the team lost to Creighton in the first round.\nJohnson's hiring sparked an atmosphere of excitement that was evident the moment he was hired and lasted throughout the season. When he was introduced to the school on April 8, he promised that his basketball program would aspire to reach the Final Four, something an Alabama team has never accomplished; in fact, Alabama has only reached the Elite Eight once, in 2004. In stark contrast to Grant's quiet, unassuming demeanor, Johnson offered enthusiasm and pep throughout the summer months, attending numerous dinners, visiting football practices, and appearing on television, all to further promote the basketball program. This evidently paid off, as the 2015–16 season destroyed the school record for home attendance, with an average of 13,110 people at each game in the 15,383-seat Coleman Coliseum. The previous record average was 12,484. The coliseum also sold out five times for the first time since the 2006–07 season.\nAs for the season itself, the team shook off two early blowouts to make a splash on the national scene, upsetting two ranked teams in the AdvoCare Invitational. The Tide finished its non-conference schedule with nine wins and three losses, the same number of non-conference losses as the previous season. Coincidentally, just like the 2014–15 season, all three teams that the Crimson Tide lost to made the NCAA tournament. The team suffered an awful start to conference play, losing five of its first six games, although the one win did come against a ranked, undefeated South Carolina squad. Then Alabama surged, winning six of its next seven games to catapult into the NCAA Tournament conversation with five games remaining in the regular season. However, the Tide went 1–4 in those games to move itself off of the tournament bubble and into the bottom half of the middling SEC. One win in the SEC Tournament was enough to get Alabama an at-large NIT bid, but a blowout on the road at Creighton in the first round ended the season.\nRedshirt senior guard Retin Obasohan was far and away the team's leader and biggest contributor during the season. After serving as nothing more than a role-player for his first three seasons playing at the Capstone, Obasohan was charged with the duties of team co-captain and senior leader after the graduation of starters Levi Randolph and Rodney Cooper from the prior season, and he was also eventually charged with filling the starting point guard role after a season-ending injury to freshman Dazon Ingram. Obasohan exceedingly fulfilled those responsibilities, upping his scoring average from 6.2 to 17.6 points per game and refining his defensive skills, while also serving as the driving force behind the team's emotion and energy. In recognition of his exceptional season, Obasohan was named to the All-SEC First Team and the All-SEC Defensive Team. He was also named the SEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year. Obasohan ended his career at UA ranked in the top ten of Alabama's career steals leaders, the top 20 of Alabama's single-season points leaders (for his 2015–16 season), and the top 40 of Alabama's career points leaders.\nBefore the season.\nPrevious season.\nAlabama finished the 2014–15 season with a 19–15 overall record (8–10 in the SEC) and an appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. The team started the season very strong, winning twelve of its first fifteen games, with all three losses coming against teams that went on to make the 2015 NCAA tournament. However, through the course of SEC play after those first fifteen games, the Tide faltered, developing an inability to put together consecutive wins—an issue that lasted for the rest of the season. As a result, Alabama suffered a losing home record in conference play for the first time since 1969. The team finished the season tied for eighth place in the SEC standings and was awarded the #9 seed and a first-round bye in the SEC tournament. In the second round, the Crimson Tide was eliminated, falling to the eighth-seeded Florida Gators 69–61. In the postseason, the team was selected to play in the NIT as a #6 seed. Alabama routed #3 seed Illinois 79–58 in the first round, but lost to #2 seed Miami 73–66 in the second round to end the Tide's season.\nCoaching changes.\nOn March 15, three days after Alabama's loss to Florida in the SEC Tournament, UA athletic director Bill Battle released a statement announcing that Anthony Grant would not be retained as the head coach thereafter, presumably due to major fan dissatisfaction with the consistently mediocre seasons his teams produced, as evidenced by declining home attendance numbers. Later that day, Alabama received its invitation to the NIT. Stuck without a head coach, the school named assistant coach John Brannen as the interim head coach for the tournament.\nFollowing the conclusion of Alabama's season on March 21, Battle began intensively searching for a replacement for Grant. Early rumors indicated that Indiana head coach Tom Crean and then-Murray State head coach Steve Prohm (who attended Alabama) were Battle's biggest targets. However, over the next several days, those names gave way to that of Wichita State's Gregg Marshall, and it was reported on March 23 that Alabama was prepared to offer Marshall a contract in excess of $3 million per year. Then, on April 1, reports indicated that Marshall would soon visit Tuscaloosa with his family while pondering whether or not to take the Alabama job; however, later that day, it was confirmed that he had decided to stay at Wichita State.\nIn an unusual move, Battle addressed Marshall's decision to remain at Wichita State in a public statement. With his first option ruled out, Battle contacted former National Basketball Association player and coach Avery Johnson, who expressed considerable interest in the job. Johnson had not been a coach since 2012, and had never coached at the collegiate level (having only been the head coach of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets). Despite that, Battle quickly arranged to meet with Johnson and his family and hired him shortly afterward on April 6. It was later reported that at the time of his meeting with Battle, Johnson was just days away from signing a contract extension as an analyst with ESPN. He was formally introduced as the new Alabama head coach on April 8.\nJohnson subsequently hired two assistant coaches, while retaining former Alabama player Antoine Pettway as an assistant coach for his fifth year with the program and Lou DeNeen as the strength and conditioning coach for his third year with the program. On April 20, he hired Providence assistant coach Bob Simon as his associate head coach, and then on June 4, he hired \"legendary\" AAU coach Scott Pospichal as a third assistant.\nRoster changes.\nDepartures.\nFollowing the firing of Grant, four players left the team, with three of them electing to transfer to other schools. Additionally, two seniors graduated and signed with professional teams, while another chose to continue his collegiate career as a graduate student at a different school.\nSource: \nClass of 2015 signees.\n Lawson Schaffer, a 5-foot-11 point guard from Cullman High School in Cullman, Alabama, announced on April 30, 2015, that he would walk on at Alabama as part of the class of 2015. He was not rated by Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, or ESPN.\n†\"The spelling and punctuation of Hall's first name (\"Donta\", \"Donta′\", \"Danta\", and \"Danta′\") varies among recruiting sites, news articles, and Alabama's official roster. The spelling and punctuation found on Alabama's official roster was used in this article.\"\nOther additions.\nFollowing the hiring of Johnson, Alabama added to its roster four players not part of the class of 2015: a former national Top 50 recruit, junior Nick King; Johnson's son, sophomore Avery Johnson Jr.; graduate transfer Arthur Edwards; and sophomore walk-on Christian Clark.\nSources: \nSeason.\nOn August 5, the school announced that the student section in Coleman Coliseum would be shifted over two sections to the side and corner of the court opposite the visiting team's bench in an attempt to enhance the home-court advantage in the coliseum and to make the students more visible on television and closer to the court. The student section was previously directly behind the goal next to the visiting team's bench. To complement that change, the area where television cameras are set up was moved to the opposite side of the coliseum and the court was repainted so it would not appear upside down on television broadcasts.\nAlabama released its full non-conference schedule, consisting of twelve regular season games and one exhibition game, on August 10. The full conference slate was released by the SEC for all of its member schools on August 19. Alabama played eighteen SEC games for a total of thirty regular season games overall.\nThe team held its first official full team practice on October 2.\nOn October 21, members of the SEC media voted the Crimson Tide to finish 13th in the end-of-season SEC standings, ahead of only Missouri. In the end, Alabama finished three spots higher in tenth place.\nOn October 27, the entire team, along with the women's basketball team, was introduced to students, faculty, and season ticket holders at the \"Tide Tipoff\" at Coleman Coliseum, which included a three-point contest, a dunk contest, and a performance from hip hop duo Rae Sremmurd.\nAlabama announced on December 10 that freshman point guard Dazon Ingram had suffered a fractured left foot in practice two days prior and would miss the remainder of the season following surgery. Ingram started the first seven games for the Crimson Tide, and at the time of his injury, he led the team in rebounding and assists averages. He was eligible for a medical redshirt and returned for the 2016–17 season with four years of eligibility.\nJunior forward and starter Shannon Hale missed three games from December 16 to December 29 due to an ambiguously-referenced \"medical condition\". He returned in a backup role on January 2 to play limited minutes in Alabama's win over Norfolk State. He returned to a starting role on January 23 versus LSU.\nSophomore guard Justin Coleman saw his playing time suddenly drop for a period from January 23 to February 2 due to a nagging turf toe injury that he aggravated in practice. Although he did not start, he returned to being a big contributor for the team in the February 2 game against Mississippi State, seemingly unbothered by the injury despite being listed as a \"game-time decision\".\nInjuries continued to pile up on Alabama during SEC play as Hale missed the February 2 Mississippi State game with a foot injury suffered in the January 30 game at South Carolina. Additionally, junior forward Michael Kessens was forced to exit the MSU game with a knee injury. Kessens returned the next game, while Hale missed one more game before returning on February 10 against Texas A&amp;M. The team managed to avoid any more major injuries thereafter, although it is notable to point out that Kessens started in place of Hale in every game after February 2.\nThe regular season ended on March 5, at which point Alabama was assigned the #10 seed in the SEC tournament, resulting in a first-round bye for the Tide.\nIn reference to a quote made by head coach Avery Johnson in his introductory press conference on April 8, the unofficial slogan of the team's season was \"#BuckleUp\". The school embraced this, including it in Tweets by the team's official Twitter account and on props given to students at basketball games.\nGame summaries.\nNon-conference play.\nAlabama kicked off the season with a home exhibition game against the Division II Trevecca Nazarene Trojans on November 6, which the Crimson Tide won handily, 87–65. The regular season began on November 13 in Tuscaloosa with a 77–64 win over Kennesaw State in front of 14,970 fans, the most at an Alabama home opener since 1989. Freshman guard Dazon Ingram filled the stat sheet with 16 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals in his first true game in an Alabama uniform. Senior guard Retin Obasohan also emerged as a potential leader for the Tide, contributing 18 points and three steals. This game marked Avery Johnson's official head coaching debut with Alabama, as well as his collegiate coaching debut in general. Alabama then took a trip to Dayton, Ohio, to face the Dayton Flyers as part of ESPN's \"College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon\". Despite a competitive start, the Tide suffered a poor overall shooting performance against the Flyers' stout defense and got obliterated, 80–48. No Alabama player exceeded nine points. The 32-point margin of defeat marked the worst Alabama loss since a 2001 game against Ole Miss.\nAfter the embarrassing loss, Alabama returned to friendlier confines to win a 105–93 shootout over Louisiana–Lafayette in which the Crimson Tide displayed a much-improved shooting proficiency with six players reaching double-digit point totals. The team hit fifteen three-pointers and scored the most points by an Alabama team in a game since 2005. Sophomore guard Justin Coleman, junior forward Shannon Hale, and sophomore forward Riley Norris all scored a team-high 18 points for the Tide. With a bounce-back win in its pocket, Alabama next headed to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando for the AdvoCare Invitational, where in the first round the team faced #23 Xavier. Ultimately, the Crimson Tide fell to the clearly more-talented Musketeers, 64–45, in a game very similar to the Dayton game. Alabama played a competitive first half and trailed by only three at halftime, but poor second-half shooting allowed the Musketeers to pull away. Like the Dayton game, the Tide once again failed to find a reliable scoring option, with Hale and Coleman being the top contributors with only ten points apiece. This was Alabama's third loss to Xavier in as many seasons. However, the Tide bounced back in a huge way, knocking off 20th-ranked (albeit shorthanded) Wichita State 64–60 the very next day in the consolation game for the school's first win versus a ranked opponent since the 2010–11 season. A Norris three-pointer off of an offensive rebound with just under six minutes to play gave Alabama the lead for good. Alabama matched the number of field goals made from the previous game (17), but did so in thirteen fewer attempts. Two days later, the team pulled off an even bigger upset, this time over #17 Notre Dame in the fifth-place game. Retin Obasohan contorted his body to get the go-ahead game-winning layup with eight seconds remaining in the 74–73 win; he finished with 19 points and five assists. In the final minutes of the game, Alabama had to endure two starters—Dazon Ingram and junior forward Jimmie Taylor—fouling out. Alabama had not beaten back-to-back ranked opponents since 2006. With the win, the Crimson Tide placed fifth in the AdvoCare Invitational.\nThe Tide continued its non-conference slate by heading to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to play Southern Miss, where the team staggered its way to a 58–55 win over the then-winless Golden Eagles for the Crimson Tide's first true road win of the season. Alabama put together a 19–4 second-half scoring run to take a ten-point lead, but USM fought back. Over the final seven minutes, the Golden Eagles whittled the lead down to three and had an opportunity to force overtime with two three-point attempts in the last seconds, but both missed and Alabama survived. After taking a crucial blow by losing Dazon Ingram for the rest of the season due to injury, Alabama trudged on, traveling to Greenville, South Carolina, to face the Clemson Tigers. The Crimson Tide held a single-digit lead for most of the game until Clemson took advantage of an Alabama scoring drought to take a 50–49 lead with under a minute to play. But with 29 seconds left, Alabama's Shannon Hale stole a Clemson inbounds pass and broke away for an easy dunk to give the Tide the lead for good in the 51–50 win, its fourth straight away from home. After going 4–1 (and 2–1 versus ranked teams) on its longest road trip since the 2000–01 season, Alabama returned home for a December 16 matchup with Winthrop. With Hale, a starter, out due to a medical condition, the Tide used a dominant second half and a double-double from Jimmie Taylor to soundly beat the Eagles 72–60. Justin Coleman matched a season-high with 18 points. Two late 7–0 Winthrop scoring runs cut down an Alabama lead that inflated to as much as 23 points in the second half.\nIn the last major game of Alabama's non-conference schedule, the Crimson Tide hosted Oregon at the Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex (BJCC). This was the first time Alabama had played in Birmingham since a game against Oklahoma State at the BJCC during the 2011–12 season, which the Tide won. This time, however, the team came up just short. Following the narrative of its previous two losses, Alabama played an outstanding first half with great shooting and led 38–26 at the break, but Oregon's shooters got hot in the second half and held on to an early second-half lead to beat the Tide 72–68. Justin Coleman, back in his hometown of Birmingham, lit up the BJCC with a career-high 24 points on seven made field goals and six free throws to keep Alabama in the game. Riley Norris had a chance to tie the game at 68 in the final minute, but his three-pointer was off the mark; Oregon followed that with two free throws. Although Alabama senior guard Arthur Edwards nailed a three-pointer with six seconds remaining, Oregon hit two more free throws to put the game out of reach. The Crimson Tide then returned to Tuscaloosa to take on a scrappy Jacksonville State squad. Alabama head coach Avery Johnson said after the game that he had been \"really concerned\" about the game in the days leading up to it. His concerns held true, as the Gamecocks overcame a thirteen-point deficit in the second half (after leading by two at halftime) to tie the game at 55 late in regulation. Retin Obasohan had a chance to win it for Alabama with two free-throw attempts with 2.3 seconds left, but he missed both, leading to overtime. However, the Tide managed to take over in overtime and won the game 67–59. Alabama then capped off its non-conference slate against Norfolk State, using some sharp shooting from Obasohan and Edwards to aid in a 68–49 blowout win. Obasohan scored 23 on 9-of-12 field-goal shooting, while Edwards added 15 from five three-pointers on nine attempts. Some of Alabama's players stated that the near-collapse in the JSU game caught the team's attention and that the players' focus and accuracy in the blowout of Norfolk State could be attributed to that. Shannon Hale returned to the team for this game for his first playing time since the Clemson game.\nConference play.\nThroughout the course of the conference regular season, Alabama faced all thirteen fellow SEC members, playing five of them twice. Three of those five teams—Auburn, LSU, and Mississippi State—are Alabama's permanent \"rivals\", in a sense, in that Alabama faces those three teams twice every season, a practice that started with the 2015–16 season.\nAlabama opened its SEC schedule against Ole Miss at the Rebels' new arena, The Pavilion at Ole Miss. This was Ole Miss's debut game there after having played its home games in Tad Smith Coliseum for nearly 50 years, and it predictably attracted a capacity crowd of 9,500 people. Alabama fell victim to early foul trouble for its post players, particularly starter Jimmie Taylor, and blew an eight-point halftime lead, losing the game 74–66. Retin Obasohan burst onto the SEC scene in this game, matching a career-high with 23 points, while also adding six rebounds, four assists, and three steals. However, the Crimson Tide's second-half offense could not keep up with the Rebels, producing only 26 points on nine field goals made. Two days later, the Tide played an even tougher opponent in #9 Kentucky, this time at home in front of another sellout crowd. Despite a third-straight performance from Obasohan with 20 or more points, Kentucky enjoyed a career-best 25 points from senior forward Alex Poythress and a massive +18 team rebounding margin en route to a 77–61 blowout victory over the Crimson Tide. After the game, Wildcats head coach John Calipari was quoted as saying \"that's as good as we play\". However, Alabama's confidence evidently did not waver despite opening SEC play with an 0–2 record, because in its next game against 19th-ranked and 15–0 South Carolina (which, along with SMU, represented the only remaining undefeated Division I teams), the Tide attacked the Gamecocks early and often. Alabama turned a 19–4 start and a 35–22 halftime lead into a 73–50 onslaught to give South Carolina its first loss of the season and head coach Avery Johnson his first ever SEC win. Riley Norris tied a school record for most made three-pointers, going 8-for-11 from long range, and finished with a career-high 27 points.\nAlabama then began a two-game road trip in Nashville at Vanderbilt. Horrid free-throw shooting by Alabama (7/20; 35%) and hot three-point shooting by Vandy (9/16; 56%) resulted in a convincing 71–63 win for the Commodores. With the win, Vanderbilt took a 68–67 lead in the all-time series. To close out the short road trip, the Crimson Tide headed south to visit Auburn for the Iron Bowl of Basketball. Retin Obasohan came up big for the team once again, contributing a career-high 27 points along with six rebounds, but Auburn junior guard Kareem Canty seemingly couldn't miss, going 5-for-8 from the three-point line and finishing with 25 points as the Tigers held on to a slim halftime lead to win, 83–77, in the first of two editions of the rivalry for the season. With the team bereft of any semblance of momentum, having lost four of its last five games, Alabama returned home for a huge matchup against spectacular freshman forward Ben Simmons and the LSU Tigers. The game was back-and-forth throughout its duration, with the largest lead of the whole game being eight points. After a Tim Quarterman layup gave LSU a two-point lead with 32 seconds to go, Alabama was unable to get a quality shot off before the buzzer, resulting in a 72–70 win for the Tigers. Simmons shined, racking up 23 points and eight boards despite foul trouble late in the game. Obasohan led Alabama with 20 points and Riley Norris notched a double-double.\nThe demoralizing effects of the loss to LSU were evident throughout the majority of the Crimson Tide's next game, when the team hosted the Tennessee Volunteers. Alabama mustered only four points in the first ten minutes of the game, and eventually the team found itself down by fifteen to the Vols with fourteen minutes to go in the game. Then, Retin Obasohan and Shannon Hale took over; Obasohan (22 points) made multiple driving layups and a high-flying dunk while Hale (20 points) converted nine of ten free throws and a dunk of his own, powering a fierce Tide comeback. With the game tied at 57 with less than a minute to go, Arthur Edwards swished a three-pointer to take the lead, and off of a steal Obasohan converted a layup while being fouled and made the ensuing free throw to seal the comeback win, 63–57. The win snapped a three-game losing skid, the longest of the season. In its following game, Alabama took on South Carolina in Columbia in an attempt to complete a two-game season sweep of the Gamecocks. In just the seventh sellout in Colonial Life Arena history, South Carolina took advantage of a foul advantage of 30–19 (which resulted in four Alabama players, including two starters, fouling out) as well as a whopping 20 offensive rebounds to outmuscle the Tide in a 78–64 Gamecock revenge win. Yet again, Obasohan proved his worth as the only true consistent leader on Alabama's team, at one point scoring 16 straight points for the Crimson Tide in the second half despite being burdened with four fouls during that entire stretch. He ended with 23 points and was eventually disqualified on a technical foul after the game was out of reach.\nAlabama next faced the surging Bulldogs of Mississippi State at Humphrey Coliseum. The Crimson Tide was very hampered by injuries, inherently missing Dazon Ingram while also missing starter Shannon Hale due to injury and losing junior forward Michael Kessens (who started in place of Hale) to an injury during the game. The game was a close one throughout, and a clutch, acrobatic running jumper by Retin Obasohan with about a minute left in regulation tied the game at 67, ultimately forcing overtime. In OT, Justin Coleman's seven points helped lead the Tide to an 82–80 win. Obasohan continued his all-SEC-caliber style of play, finishing with 25 points (his fifth-straight game with at least 20 points) and a career-high eight assists. The team followed that victory with an easy 80–71 win over a struggling Missouri squad. Five Tide players scored in double figures, Coleman Coliseum sold out for the third time of the season, and the win, coupled with the victory at MSU, signified back-to-back SEC wins for Alabama for the first time in nearly three years. Having built a little bit of momentum, the Crimson Tide turned to a major home game against #15 Texas A&amp;M, who entered the game on a three-game SEC losing streak after starting 7–0 in the league. Alabama enjoyed nice contributions from essentially every scholarship player, including 16 points from Obasohan and a career-high ten rebounds from freshman forward Donta Hall, and the Tide held on for a thrilling 63–62 win over the Aggies. Anthony Collins, the SEC's leading free-throw shooter at the time, missed two potentially game-tying free throws for A&amp;M with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. This game marked Alabama's fourth win over a ranked team, a feat the school had not accomplished since the 2001–02 season. Hale returned from a two-game hiatus due to injury to play in this game, scoring ten points off the bench.\nAlabama then hit the road to take on a talented Florida Gators squad. The Gators came in as a near-double-digit point favorite and led at the half, 27–23, with both teams having trouble making shots in the first half. In the second half, Alabama surged, eventually taking a two-point lead on a three-point play by Retin Obasohan with 8:50 to go. However, about three minutes later, with the Crimson Tide up 48–44, Obasohan and Arthur Edwards, both starters, were called for their fifth fouls and were forced to exit the game, leaving the Tide without its entire starting backcourt. Then Jimmie Taylor sprung into action, swatting Florida's shots and drilling thunderous dunks. Because of his efforts, Alabama never trailed for the rest of the game and left the O'Connell Center with a huge 61–55 victory. Taylor finished with eleven points, five blocks, and four rebounds in 27 minutes of work. The win was Alabama's first at Florida since 1995, snapping a ten-game losing streak in Gainesville as well as an eleven-game losing streak to the Gators in general. The Tide, which had by then propelled itself firmly into the NCAA tournament conversation, attempted to continue its incredible surge at LSU. The Tigers held a 36–31 halftime lead after Alabama struggled to make some open first-half shots, but Obasohan turned it on in the latter half, exploding for 23 second-half points and finishing with a career high 35 points, and Alabama left Baton Rouge with a crucial 76–69 win, further padding its tournament résumé. Justin Coleman contributed 21 points and Riley Norris grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds to assist Obasohan in leading the team to victory. The win was Alabama's fifth straight in the SEC, which marked the first time an Alabama team had done that since the 2010–11 season.\nThe team then tried to extend its win streak to six against Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa. The Bulldogs, fresh off of a thrilling last-second home win over Vanderbilt, challenged Alabama the whole game, making contested shots time and time again to maintain a small lead. Mississippi State was ahead by three at the half, and in the second half, the team answered with a big shot every time Alabama made a push for the lead. With 22 seconds left, MSU junior guard I. J. Ready sank a midrange jump shot to put the game away, and Mississippi State won 67–61. The Crimson Tide's offense was anemic aside from the play of Retin Obasohan, Shannon Hale, and Jimmie Taylor, who combined to account for 85 percent of Alabama's points. With its momentum having taken a major hit and its NCAA tournament potential in question, Alabama made a quick turnaround and went back on the road to visit #16 Kentucky to complete the season series with the Wildcats. Four and a half minutes into the game, Alabama trailed only 9–7, but then the team suffered a massive scoring drought, going 1-for-16 from the field for a long stretch before hitting two shots right before halftime. The Cats continued to build on a twelve-point halftime lead in the second half and eventually won 78–53. Sophomore guard Tyler Ulis was outstanding for Kentucky, recording 19 points and ten assists. Conversely, Alabama's offense was downright lethargic, relying on Obasohan's 29 points to stay remotely competitive in the game.\nTo begin the final stretch of the regular season, the Crimson Tide returned home to try to avenge the loss at Auburn from earlier in the season. In front of the fifth and final Coleman Coliseum sellout crowd of the season, Alabama overcame a 17/29 free-throw shooting performance, a ten-point deficit in the second half, and a double-double from Auburn senior forward Cinmeon Bowers to escape with a 65–57 win. Multiple dunks by Donta Hall (who finished with a career-high ten points) and Michael Kessens fueled the energy for the team, and a block of Bowers's shot by Retin Obasohan with less than a minute to go allowed the Crimson Tide to pull away at the free throw line for the win. The game displayed a great deal of physicality, with 47 total fouls being called on the teams. Alabama's next game came against Arkansas, and since it was Alabama's last home game of the regular season, it served as senior night for Obasohan and Arthur Edwards. The Tide played yet another close game throughout and found itself behind for most of the second half, eventually trailing by two with 13.4 seconds left and with possession of the ball. Obasohan and Justin Coleman both missed shots on the possession, and Arkansas hit two ensuing free throws to put the game out of reach, winning 62–61. Obasohan gave another incredible performance for his senior night, scoring 32. The game all but eliminated the Crimson Tide from NCAA Tournament contention. To close out the regular season, Alabama visited Georgia. A +22 rebounding advantage for the Bulldogs allowed Georgia to maintain a small lead for most of the game, and Georgia's J. J. Frazier made all eight of his free-throw attempts in the last minute of the game to help the Bulldogs finish the season with a 70–63 victory over the Crimson Tide. In a rare occurrence, Obasohan did not lead the team in scoring; Shannon Hale did with 25 points. After the game, Georgia head coach Mark Fox campaigned for Alabama to be selected to play in the NCAA Tournament, stating, \"They're a tournament-worthy team and their kids deserve the opportunity based on the schedule they played.\"\nSEC Tournament.\nAfter the conclusion of the final SEC game on Saturday, March 5, the seedings for the SEC tournament were set. The tournament was held at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. Alabama received a first-round bye and the #10 seed in the tournament. In the Crimson Tide's first tournament game, the team was matched up with #7 seed Ole Miss in the second round. The Rebels jumped out to an early lead as Retin Obasohan endured early foul trouble, picking up his second foul less than five minutes into the game. Obasohan spent most of the half on the bench and recorded no points. Alabama held a small lead for most of the half as the two teams traded shots and headed to the locker rooms with the Crimson Tide leading 40–36. Then, in the second half, three-pointers by Obasohan, Riley Norris, and Arthur Edwards gave the Tide a 53–44 lead with fifteen minutes to play. From that point on, Alabama cruised, with its lead never falling below five points and at one point reaching fourteen. Alabama advanced to the quarterfinals with an 81–73 victory. Ole Miss senior guard Stefan Moody scored 39 points in the game, which tied for the second-most in SEC tournament history. Alabama had some star shooters of its own, with Obasohan leading the team with 17 points—all scored in the second half—and Norris, Edwards, and Justin Coleman also contributing at least 15 points apiece.\nIn the SEC quarterfinals, Alabama faced #2 seed Kentucky for the third time of the season. Despite another slow start by Retin Obasohan, the Crimson Tide only trailed by three after over ten minutes of play. But then the Tide suffered a drought that lasted five and a half minutes to allow UK to take an eight-point lead, which the Wildcats eventually extended to ten by halftime. After the half, Kentucky came out on fire from long range, and a 13–2 run gave the Wildcats a double-digit lead that the team would not relinquish. As Kentucky continued to drain three-pointers and Alabama continued to struggle shooting, the lead stretched to 26 and the Crimson Tide was eliminated from the SEC Tournament by a score of 85–59. Arthur Edwards built on 14 first-half points to finish the game with 20. Kentucky shot 59% from three-point range to quell any hope for a second-half Tide comeback. With only one win in the SEC Tournament and sitting only four games above a .500 winning percentage at 18–14, Alabama was essentially locked out of the NCAA Tournament.\nNational Invitation Tournament.\nAlabama was not selected to play in the NCAA tournament, but the team did earn and accept a bid to play in the National Invitation Tournament as a #5 seed. The team was paired with #4 seed Creighton, which had also finished the regular season with an 18–14 record after going 9–9 in the Big East and finishing sixth in the conference. Since Creighton was the higher seed, the game was played in Omaha, Nebraska, at Creighton's home arena, CenturyLink Center Omaha.\nStatistics and rankings.\nThe team holds an 18–13 record (8–10 in conference play), with a 10–5 record at home, a 5–7 record on the road, and a 3–1 record at neutral sites. The team also owns a 4–3 record against teams that were ranked when Alabama played them. Retin Obasohan leads the team in scoring average at 17.7 points per game, Riley Norris leads all active players with 5.4 rebounds per game, and Justin Coleman leads the team in assists at 3.5 per game. Additionally, Jimmie Taylor ranks 53rd-best in the country in blocks per game at an average of 1.9, while Coleman ranks sixth-best in the country in free-throw percentage, having made 71 of his 79 attempts, which is good for 89.9%. Alabama is averaging a meager 67.0 points per game, while allowing an average of 67.1 points scored by its opponents. The team is 13–3 when holding opponents under 70 points, and 5–10 otherwise. According to NCAA.com, Alabama's RPI résumé is the 75th-best in the country and the seventh-best in the SEC, while according to ESPN, its strength of schedule ranks 30th-highest in the country and third-highest in the conference. The Crimson Tide did not receive any votes in the AP or Coaches Polls.\nCombined team statistics.\nSource: \nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#990000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition game\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#990000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#990000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#990000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#990000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| National Invitation Tournament\nClass of 2016 recruiting.\nAlabama currently holds two commitments for its 2016 recruiting class: JUCO swingman Ar'Mond Davis, who announced his commitment to Alabama on Twitter on September 23, 2015, after decommitting from Memphis earlier that month, and four-star forward Braxton Key (formerly Braxton Blackwell), who committed to the Tide over his hometown school, Vanderbilt, as well as Kansas and Texas, on October 21, 2015. On August 17, 2015, consensus five-star wing and McDonald's All-American Terrance Ferguson committed to Alabama. However, as Key and Davis signed their letters of commitment to the Capstone in November during the early signing period, Ferguson hesitated, causing numerous rumors to circulate questioning the strength of his commitment. Eventually, on March 1, Ferguson's high school basketball coach informed the media that the top-20 recruit had decided to decommit from Alabama and reopen his recruitment. He did not rule out a possible recommitment to Alabama, however, so now the Crimson Tide is competing with Kansas and others to land Ferguson.\nAdditional sources: "

The Frogs have made the NCAA Tournament in five of Roditi's first eight seasons back on campus, highlighted by a trip to the national semifinals in 2015 and three consecutive Big 12 regular season titles in 2016, 2017 and 2018. He also worked with the Big 12 to amend rules for spectator behavior, allowing for a more boisterous atmosphere at matches.

The eventers complete a 3-star level dressage test, stadium, and cross-country course. Eventing consisted of three phases: dressage, cross-country, and show-jumping. Scores from each phase were converted into penalty points, which were summed to give a score. For each rider, the best three scores in each phase counted towards the final score. In the dressage portion, the pair performed in front of three judges. The judges gave marks of between 0 and 10 for each of ten required elements; the scores for the judges were averaged to give a score between 0 and 100. That score was then subtracted from 100 and multiplied by 1.5 to give the number of penalty points.\nThe cross-county portion consisted of a 5.225 kilometre course with 30 efforts including 17 obstacles. The target time was nine and a half minutes; pairs received .4 penalty points for every second above that time. They also received 20 penalty points for every obstacle not cleanly jumped. Riders did not complete the course in under nineteen minutes were eliminated and given a score of 1000 penalty points. The final phase was the show-jumping; pairs had to negotiate a course of obstacles. The pair received 4 penalty points for each obstacle at which there was a refusal or a knockdown of the obstacle. One penalty point was also assessed for each second taken above the maximum time for the course. In addition, 1000 points are given to any rider that did not complete a competition. This includes withdraing/not-starting (WD), retiring during the competition (RD) or being eliminated in the cross county event (EL).\nThe top team not already qualified in the dressage team events qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, along with the top two placed teams (not already qualified) in the show jumping competition.

        "text": "The men's eight rowing competition at the 1980 Summer Olympics took place at the Krylatskoye Rowing Canal in Moscow, Soviet Union. The event was held from 21 to 26 July. There were 9 boats (81 competitors) from 9 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The first two places were the same as in 1976, with East Germany successfully defending its title (the third nation to do so, after the United States and Great Britain) and Great Britain repeating as runner-up. The 1976 bronze medalist, New Zealand, was not competing; the Soviet Union took bronze in 1980.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nBeginning with an Olympic bronze medal in 1972 and running through the 1970s, East Germany had risen to take a dominant place in men's eight competitions. By the time of the Moscow Games, the East Germans were the reigning (1976) Olympic champions and four-time reigning (1975, 1977, 1978, and 1979) World champions. Two major competitors, New Zealand and West Germany, were absent in 1980; East Germany was thus heavily favoured over the nearest competitors (host Soviet Union).\nBulgaria made its debut in the event. Great Britain made its 14th appearance, most among nations competing in 1980 and tied with the absent Canada for second-most behind the also-absent United States at 15.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). This rowing competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals), as well as a repechage round after the semifinals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe fastest team in each heat advanced to the \"A\" final. The remaining teams competed in the repechage for the remaining spots in the final.\nRepechage.\nThe two fastest teams in each repechage heat advanced to the \"A\" final."

        "text": "The Sint Maarten national cricket team has represented the Dutch Overseas Territory of Sint Maarten in cricket. The team is not a member of the International Cricket Council, but is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from Sint Maarten generally represent the Leeward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. Sint Maarten has however played as a separate entity in matches which held Twenty20 status, but has not appeared in first-class or List A cricket. The team's current coach is Rishie Singh, who was appointed in 2009. As of September 2014, the team's captain is Kenroy David.\nHistory.\nA Sint Maarten cricket team is first recorded in West Indian cricket in 2000 against touring English county side Leicestershire. The team made its debut in the NAGICO Leeward Islands One-Day tournament against the British Virgin Islands in 2003, and has continued to play in the tournament since then. Sint Maarten finished as runners-up in the 2009 edition.\nIn 2004, Sint Maarten hosted first-class cricket for the first time when the Leeward Islands played the Windward Islands in the 2003/04 Carib Cup at the Carib Lumber Ball Park, Philipsburg. To date the Carib Lumber Ball Park has played host to six first-class and one List A match.\nSint Maarten were invited to take part in the 2006 Stanford 20/20, whose matches held official Twenty20 status. They played one match in the tournament against the United States Virgin Islands, which they lost by 47 runs, resulting in their elimination from the tournament. Two years later, they were invited to take part in the 2008 Stanford 20/20, where they were due to play Cuba in the preliminary round. However, as the tournament was organised by Allen Stanford, a US citizen, Cuba were barred from participating in the tournament due to the United States embargo against Cuba, and Sint Maarten were thus granted a bye into the next round. They played Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the next round, and were beaten by 10 runs. These matches mark Sint Maarten's only major appearances in cricket."

It was the third time since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that Russia and Canada met in the IIHF World Championship final. Canada got on the board first, scoring late in the first period. They proceeded to dominate the second period, outshooting Russia 14–1 and scoring three goals. Canada added two goals in the third period before Russia scored one to make the final score 6–1.\nFor Canada, it was the first IIHF World Championship gold medal since 2007. They became the fourth team in the event's history to go undefeated, finishing with a 10–0 record. Sidney Crosby became the 26th player in the Triple Gold Club (Olympic, World, and Stanley Cup Championships) and the first player to win all three as a team captain.\nRoad to the final.\nCanada.\nEntering the IIHF World Championships, Canada was the heavy favorite due to strong roster including Sidney Crosby, Matt Duchene, Claude Giroux and Tyler Seguin. The team went 7–0 in round robin play then defeated Belarus 9–0 in the quarterfinals and the Czech Republic 2–0 in the semi-finals.\nRussia.\nRussia entered the tournament as the defending champion. Their team featured a high-powered offense behind stars Ilya Kovalchuk, Evgeni Malkin, Alexander Ovechkin and Vladimir Tarasenko. The team went 5–2 in round robin play, with the one of the losses being on a shootout. They then defeated Sweden 5–3 in the quarterfinals and the United States 4–0 in the semifinals.\nMatch.\nThe opening period was penalty-free. Both teams had good scoring opportunities, but Canada controlled the puck, spending much of the period in the Russian zone. Canada got on the board first when Russian Viktor Tikhonov failed to clear the zone. Tyler Ennis got the puck from Jake Muzzin, weaved through the middle of the ice and got off a low shot. The puck hit Cody Eakin's skate and went in at the 18:10 mark.\nCanada dominated the second period, outshooting Russia 14–1 on the period. Ennis opened the scoring for Canada 1:56 into the period when his curl around the net caught goalkeeper Sergei Bobrovski by surprise. Canada's Sidney Crosby scored next on a high shot over Bobrovski's glove at the 7:22 mark, after receiving a tip pass from Jordan Eberle. Forty-four seconds later, Tyler Seguin scored the fourth goal for Canada on a pass from Claude Giroux with a delayed penalty in effect. Russian coach Oleg Znarok called a timeout midway through the period, but Canada kept pressing.\nCanada took a 5–0 lead on a Giroux power-play goal, assisted by Crosby, 8:58 into the period. Nathan MacKinnon made it 6–0 less than a minute later. Russia finally got on the board on an Evgeni Malkin goal, assisted by Sergei Mozyakin, 12:47 into the period. The goal ended a 190:03 shutout streak for Canadian goalkeeper Mike Smith and concluded the scoring. For the game, Bobrovsky allowed 6 goals on 37 shots, while Smith gave up 1 goal on 12 shots.\nCanada outscored their opponents 66–15 throughout the tournament and became the fourth team to go undefeated at the World Championships since 1994. The team was awarded a 1 million Swiss Franc \"Team Jackpot\" prize as a result. Six of the tournament's top ten point scorers were member of team Canada, led by Jason Spezza's 14. It was the first gold medal for Canada since 2007, and first medal of any kind since 2009. Crosby entered the Triple Gold Club – players who have won the Stanley Cup, Olympic gold, and World Championship gold – with the win. He became the first person to win all three as team captain, and the 26th Triple Gold player member.\nAfter the game Crosby remarked, \"I don't think you come into a game like this thinking you're going to win 6–1 ... We got better as the tournament went on, and we saved our best for last here today.\" Ovechkin said his team \"threw the game away\" in the second period but added, \"Of course [Canada] played really well today, it's obvious that they're a good experienced team and they showed it today.\" He was also quoted as saying, \"[O]f course, someone was tired and maybe someone was less prepared. But all of us were in similar conditions, and speaking about fatigue would be wrong [...] Everyone fought and did their best, but unfortunately, the Canadians were much stronger than us.\"\nAt the medal ceremony, most Russian players walked out before the Canadian anthem was played. Sport commentator Don Cherry called the Russian team \"dishonorable\" and said they could not accept clear defeat. After the tournament, Russian officials had claimed this was an organizational error, not a means of disrespect, however, the general manager later apologized to Canada for the incident. IIHF investigated the incident and fined Russia 80,000 Swiss francs; the Russian federation accepted the fine.\nThe United States took the bronze medal with a 3–0 win over the Czech Republic. Spezza received the directorate award winner as the tournament's best forward. Brent Burns was named the best defenseman. Finland's Pekka Rinne took the award for best goaltender. The media all-star team included Burns, Spezza, Canada's Taylor Hall, Sweden's Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Czech's Jaromír Jágr, and US goalie Connor Hellebuyck. Jágr, who had six goals and three assists, was named MVP by the media."

        "text": "The 2006 Belmont Stakes was the 138th running of the Belmont Stakes. The race was held on June 10, 2006, and was won by Jazil; it was his second victory in eight career starts. The winners of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes did not compete.\nPre-race.\nThe 2006 Triple Crown series was marred by the injury of Barbaro, the brilliant winner of the Kentucky Derby, during the Preakness Stakes. In the following weeks, Barbaro had undergone surgery for a broken right ankle and was given a good chance at survival. On the day of the Belmont, the world's largest get-well card was set up for fans to sign – roughly 20,000 people did so.\nThe field for the Belmont was further weakened when Preakness winner Bernardini was not entered in the race. The colt had three races in quick succession and his connections felt he needed a break. It was the first time since 2000 that both the Derby and Preakness winners were missing from the Belmont. The last time before that had been in 1970.\nWith the absence of Barbaro and Bernardini, the race was considered wide open. Trainer Todd Pletcher had a strong hand with Kentucky Derby runner-up Bluegrass Cat and Peter Pan winner Sunriver. Bob and John, who had won the Wood Memorial earlier in the year, had trained brilliantly at Santa Anita, while Steppenwolfer had put in a \"spectacular\" workout at Belmont. Jazil, trained by Kiaran McLaughlin, was also given a good chance after his late-closing fourth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby despite having only won one race.\nRace description.\nBob and John broke well and set a quick early pace, followed closely by High Finance and Deputy Glitters. Bluegrass Cat was not far behind the early leaders, while Jazil trailed the field. The horses maintained their positions down the backstretch, then Jazil and Bluegrass Cat started to make up ground together around the far turn. The early leaders started to fall back and Jazil pulled into the lead. Bluegrass Cat could not match Jazil's pace but was clearly second best. Sunriver made up ground late to get third place.\nIt was the first Belmont win for all of Jazil's connections. \"It is very hard to describe my feeling,\" said McLaughlin. \"The people at Shadwell have been my biggest supporters for the last 12 years. It's great to win this race for your favorite people.\"\nChart.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: – 0:23.02; – 0:47.36; – 1:12.14; mile – 1:37.53; – 2:02.69; final – 2:27.86.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.02) (:24.34) (:24.78) (:25.39) (:25.16) (:25.17)\nPayout.\n138th Belmont Payout Schedule:"

He made his debut as a pundit during the tournament, providing in-studio expert analysis for Eurosport alongside Jimmy White.\nOn the opening day of the tournament, amateur player Adam Duffy defeated world number 9 and two-time UK Champion Ding Junhui 6–2, a result that was described as \"one of the biggest upsets in UK Championship history\". In the sixth frame of his third-round match against Neil Robertson, Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh came close to achieving his first maximum break in professional competition, but missed the final black off the spot.\nThe final between Australia's Neil Robertson and China's Liang Wenbo marked the first time that a British player did not compete in the UK Championship final. In the sixth frame, Robertson made the 115th official maximum break in professional competition, and the first 147 break ever attained in a Triple Crown snooker final, for which he earned £44,000 (a rolling prize of £40,000 for a 147 break, plus the tournament's £4,000 highest break prize). It was the fourth time in a row, that a maximum was made in a UK Championship. Robertson went on to defeat Liang 10–5 to claim his second UK Championship title, and the 11th ranking title of his career.\nA record 104 centuries were made during the tournament, including nine from Robertson and eight from Liang.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nThe \"rolling 147 prize\" for a maximum break stands at £40,000 (8 ranking events since it was last won, £5,000 added for each ranking event)"

During the Group Stage, every national team played a best-of-five match against each of the other sides in their pool. Three victories were required to secure a head-to-head team win, but all five individual contests needed to be played, similar to the Davis Cup and Fed Cup formats in professional tennis. All matches were scheduled to include two singles contests, a doubles encounter, and two reverse singles showdowns. The top two teams from each bracket advanced to the Knockout Stages.\nDuring the Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals, and Championship Final, the remaining national sides were paired off a head-to-head knockout bracket. The format for these head-to-head matches was a sudden death best-of-seven competition, similar to professional sporting events like baseball's World Series and basketball's NBA Finals, with the contest coming to an end as soon as one team accumulated four individual victories. These encounters were scheduled as two singles showdowns, a doubles match, two reverse singles contests, another doubles encounter, and a winner-take-all singles showdown if necessary. The side that won the Final were named champions.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 10 century breaks in the tournament."

It was the first time that the teams of all International Cricket Council (ICC) member nations visited Sri Lanka to participate in a cricket tournament.[1]\nTwelve teams competed: the 10 Test-playing nations plus Kenya who has full One Day International (ODI) status and the 2001 ICC Trophy winners the Netherlands. The teams were split into four pools of three teams each. Each team played the other two teams in its pool once, and the four teams that lead in each pool proceeded to the Semi-finals.[2][3] Australia lost to Sri Lanka in the first semi-final whereas India defeated South Africa in the second semi final. The final between India and Sri Lanka was washed out twice, to leave no result.[4] Virender Sehwag was the highest run-scorer of the tournament and Muttiah Muralitharan was the highest wicket-taker.\nThis is a list of squads that participated in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy."

        "text": "Rugby league is a spectator sport in Tasmania, administered by the Tasmanian Rugby League. Prior to folding in 2015, the Tasmanian Rugby League Premiership was the highest tier of the sport in Tasmania. There are no rugby league competitions currently operating in Tasmania.\nHistory.\nIn the 1950s a rugby league competition was created which continued operating until the early 1960s. In the 1990s, two unsuccessful attempts were made to establish a rugby league competition.\nThe Tasmanian Rugby League was founded at a meeting at Heathorn's Hotel, Hobart on 2 December 1953 and the first competition was held in 1954 with teams including Bellerive (Eastern suburbs), Taroona, Newtown and Canterbury. Players were initially recruited from Hobart Rugby Union teams and the first matches were played on 3 April 1954 at the South St Grounds, Bellerive. The first premiership was won by Taroona.\nThe first interstate match was played against Victoria on 12 June 1954 with Tasmania winning 18-8.\nBy the mid 1990s the Tasmanian Rugby League was running a statewide competition which included Six Hobart teams:\nand three regional teams:\nThe Tasmanian Rugby League also ran a Northern Tasmanian vs Southern Tasmanian competition during this period. Ben McKinnon from the Launceston Clippers is the only player to have won the statewide best + fairest on two occasions both in his debut season in 1995 and then again in 1997.\nDue to dwindling player numbers the competition contracted to four Hobart teams during the early 2000s and midway through the 2003–04 season the senior amateur competition folded as a result of rising public liability insurance costs.\nIn late 2009 a new senior competition was established through the efforts of local 7HO FM Radio Personality Jason 'Wolfie' Wolfgram (President 09/10), and in conjunction with ARL Rugby League Development Officer, Graham McNaney. The decision to re-establish the competition followed a public forum at the Hotel Grand Chancellor in Hobart on Thursday 25 June 2009.\nGoverning body.\nNRL Tasmania (formerly and colloquially known as the Tasmanian Rugby League) is the governing body for rugby league in Tasmania.\nThe organisation is currently controlled by NRL Victoria as a cost-saving mechanism due to the low popularity of the sport in Tasmania. This has caused widespread controversy however, with many rugby league fans believing the code does not place any value in Tasmania.\nNo competitive activity has taken place since 2014.\nTasmanian Rugby League Premiership (2009–2015).\nThe Tasmanian Rugby League Premiership was reborn in 2009. \nOver its course, the competition consisted of 7 teams at various times:\nPremierships.\nThe competition folded midway through the 2014–15 season, and there have been no attempts to re-form it since.\nRepresentative Team.\nTasmanian Rugby League team is the representative team of the Tasmanian Rugby League. They have competed in many competitions since their first game in 1954, most notably in the Affiliated States Championship (sometimes combined with South Australia).\nPopularity.\nAustralian Rules is traditionally the most popular football code in Tasmania, due to the state's close proximity to Victoria.\nAccording to WIN Television, the 2014 NRL season generated an average television audience of 10,000 Tasmanians on Fridays and Sundays.\nThe two premier events in Australian rugby league, the NRL Grand Final and State of Origin, attract television audiences in excess of 40,000 Tasmanians.\nTrial matches played in the state have attracted crowds of 11,752 and 6,823 respectively.\nNRL Trial Matches.\nNRL club Melbourne Storm have played two NRL trial matches in Hobart as Tasmania falls within their franchise area."

So many of its members have fled to the NCAA that the AIAW's only realistic hope for survival is its pending antitrust suit against the NCAA in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.\" This proved to be the final AIAW basketball tournament."

        "text": "Professional \"Super Smash Bros.\" competition involves professional gamers competing in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series of crossover fighting games published by Nintendo. Organized tournament competition began in 2002 with \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", released for the GameCube in 2001; however, in the series' native Japan, there have been tournaments as early as 1999 with the original \"Super Smash Bros.\" for the Nintendo 64. Later tournaments have featured the other games in the series, with the two largest and most popular \"Smash Bros.\" scenes revolving around \"Melee\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" for the Nintendo Switch. Smaller scenes exist for the original game and \"Project M\", a popular fan modification of \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" for the Wii, and to a lesser extent, \"Brawl\" itself. Major \"Smash Bros.\" tournaments include the GENESIS, Evolution Championship Series (EVO), Super Smash Con and The Big House annual series. Major League Gaming (MLG) has also previously included \"Smash Bros.\" games in its Pro Circuit.\nThe competitive \"Smash Bros.\" community is well known in the wider fighting game community for its decentralized, grassroots scene. No official governing body or tournament circuit exists for professional \"Smash Bros.\", a byproduct of Nintendo's historical reluctance to directly promote the scene.\nHistory of competitive \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\".\nEarly years: 2002–2007.\nThe first publicized western \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" tournaments were held in early 2002, centering around the Tournament Go series hosted in California by Matt \"MattDeezie\" Dahlgren. Due to the lack of an agreed upon standardized ruleset, tournaments in this period often featured wildly different rules, with frequent disputes among competitors regarding the legality of items and the legal stagelist. A standardized ruleset was eventually developed over several years which banned all items and narrowed the legal stagelist to a select few. On March 1, 2003, the International Video Game Federation hosted the first corporate sponsored \"Super Smash Bros.\" tournament, the IVGF Northwest Regionals, won by Jeremy \"Recipherus\" Fremlin.\nThe period of 2003 to 2007 is often referred to as the \"Golden Age\" of \"Melee\"; the game was featured in the Major League Gaming (MLG) Pro Circuit during this period from 2004 to 2006. Ken Hoang was widely considered to be the best player in the world during this period, earning him the nickname \"The King of Smash\". In addition to Ken, Christopher \"Azen\" McMullen, Daniel \"ChuDat\" Rodriguez, Joel Isai \"Isai\" Alvarado, Christopher \"PC Chris\" Szygiel, Daniel \"KoreanDJ\" Jung, and Jason \"Mew2King\" Zimmerman were considered to be some of the best players at the time. \"Melee\" was also included in Evolution Championship Series (EVO) 2007, an annual major fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas. MLG dropped \"Melee\" from its circuit in 2007, however the organization still sponsored a number of tournaments as part of the underground 2007 Smash Series for a year.\nDecline: 2008–2013.\nThe \"Melee\" competitive scene suffered in the late 2000s, with the game being dropped from both the MLG circuit and EVO amid the release of the next game in the \"Smash Bros.\" series, \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" in 2008. \"Brawl\" replaced \"Melee\" in many competitive circuits; however, the former game quickly garnered a poor reputation among much of the competitive \"Smash Bros.\" community due to its slower and more defensive gameplay as well as its anti-competitive mechanics such as random tripping. In 2010, MLG picked up \"Brawl\" for its Pro Circuit for a year; during this time, Nintendo prohibited MLG from live streaming \"Brawl\" matches. The period from 2012 to 2013 is often referred to as \"The Dark Age\" of competitive \"Smash Bros.\" due to the temporary decline of \"Melee\" and the subsequent decline in popularity of \"Brawl\". Nevertheless, the period did see some major tournaments such as the inaugural GENESIS in 2009 and the launch of the Apex and The Big House tournament series.\nResurgence and the \"Five Gods\": 2013–2018.\nCompetitive \"Melee\" experienced a resurgence in popularity and support after it was again hosted at EVO 2013 after the game won a charity drive to decide the final game to be featured in its tournament lineup. Due to its large turnout and viewership that year, EVO continued including \"Melee\" in its lineup for the next five years. The competitive scene was also further popularized by the 2013 release of \"The Smash Brothers\" documentary series directed by Travis \"Samox\" Beauchamp. SmashBoards estimated that in 2014 around 3,242 events featuring a \"Smash Bros.\" game had occurred worldwide. This period saw a number of new and revived major tournament series enter the scene, including GENESIS, Super Smash Con, Community Effort Orlando (CEO), DreamHack, Major League Gaming (MLG), Shine and the Smash Summit invitational series. Other major tournament series included Apex and The Big House. Apex 2015 was officially sponsored by Nintendo of America, marking the first official Nintendo sponsorship of a community-run event while EVO 2016 was the largest \"Melee\" tournament of all time, with 2,376 entrants. In June 2014 Nintendo held an invitational \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" tournament at E3 2014 to promote the game, in which various competitive \"Smash Bros.\" players competed in a non-standard ruleset. Smash Sisters, an initiative aimed at normalizing the participation of women at tournaments, held its first all-women bracket at GENESIS 3 in 2016.\nThe period from 2013 to 2018 is sometimes referred to as \"The Platinum Age\" or \"The Era of the Five Gods\", a reference to the five most dominant players of the era: Jason \"Mew2King\" Zimmerman, Joseph \"Mango\" Marquez, Kevin \"PPMD\" Nanney (formerly known as Dr. PeePee), Adam \"Armada\" Lindgren, and Juan \"Hungrybox\" Debiedma. William \"Leffen\" Hjelte became the first player to defeat all five of the \"Five Gods\" during this period, leading some to nickname him as \"The God Slayer\", and causing the top 6 players to become collectively known as the \"Big 6\". In 2017, Justin \"Plup\" McGrath became the second player in the game's history to defeat all of the \"Five Gods\" in tournament competition, also becoming the first player outside of the Big 6 to defeat Armada in a tournament set in seven years.\n2018–present.\nIn the late 2010s, the \"Five Gods\" moniker started to become less relevant as many of the \"Gods\" stepped back from full-time competition: PPMD went on indefinite hiatus from competition in 2016 citing health issues, Armada retired from singles competition in 2018 and Mew2King semi-retired from serious competition around the same time to focus on content creation and coaching. Leffen also faced several visa-related difficulties in competing in the United States during this time. Referred to by some as \"The Chaos Age\", the current era has seen the relative decline of the \"Five Gods\" in tournament placings in favor of newer players, such as Zain Naghmi, Jeffrey \"Axe\" Williamson and Cody Schwab. Plup's first-place victory at GENESIS 5 in 2018 marked the first supermajor tournament won by a player outside of the Big 6 in several years.\n The competitive scene was significantly affected in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, shutting down virtually all in-person tournaments. However, a major milestone occurred in the summer of 2020 with the development of rollback netcode for Project Slippi, an emulated fan-made modification of \"Melee\", which allowed for low-latency online matchmaking for the first time in the game's history. While significantly contributing to the game's accessibility during the pandemic, Project Slippi also brought new legal troubles to the competitive scene, culminating in the cancellation of The Big House 10 in 2020 after the event received a cease and desist notice from Nintendo concerning the event's planned usage of Project Slippi. The cancellation was met with a highly negative reaction from the competitive community, and led to the trending of the \"#FreeMelee\" hashtag on Twitter. In November 2021, Panda (formerly Panda Global) and Nintendo jointly announced an officially licensed \"Melee\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" North American championship circuit for 2022, the first ever officially licensed \"Melee\" circuit. The Big House 10 would become a part of the Panda Cup and was held that year, becoming notable for Masaya \"aMSa\" Chikamoto's first-place victory over Mango and Hungrybox, marking his first supermajor tournament victory alongside the first major victory for Yoshi in the game's history.\nThe community's relationship with Panda and the Panda Cup would become strained with the news that Nintendo had allegedly forced the Smash World Tour to be cancelled just weeks before it was supposed to commence in early December, with Panda CEO Alan \"Dr. Alan\" Bunney accused of sabotaging the event. Follow-up statements from Nintendo and Panda received heavy backlash from the community for lack of transparency, leading numerous \"Melee\" players like aMSa and Hungrybox to drop out of the Panda Cup Finale in an act of protest. Players who were sponsored by Panda like Cody Schwab and Plup also announced their departure from the organization. In light of these events, Panda released a second statement announcing that they had removed Dr. Alan as CEO and postponed the Panda Cup Finale due to security reasons.\n\"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" and other games.\nCompetitive scenes have existed for all titles in the \"Smash Bros.\" series, with the two largest and most popular modern titles being \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" and \"Melee\". While both \"Ultimate\" and \"Melee\" share the same basic gameplay format and style and are often included in major tournaments together, the significant differences in gameplay speed, advanced tech and character matchups have led to the development of intertwined but distinct competitive scenes for the two games. Leonardo \"MKLeo\" Perez is widely considered the world's best \"Ultimate\" player, alongside other top players such as Gavin \"Tweek\" Dempsey, Sota \"Zackray\" Okada, and William \"Glutonny\" Belaïd, among others.\nSmaller competitive scenes exist for the original game for Nintendo 64 and \"Project M/Project+\", a fan-made mod of \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" designed to make the game resemble the faster gameplay style of \"Melee\". \"Smash Bros.\" games with previously active competitive scenes include \"Brawl\" (2008-2014) and \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" (2014-2018); however, in Norway, there are still \"Brawl\" events of comparable size to \"Melee\" and \"Ultimate\" events. Most \"Brawl\" and \"Wii U\" players have since migrated to \"Ultimate\", with significant overlap between top professional players of the former games and current top professional \"Ultimate\" players.\nRelationship with Nintendo.\nThe competitive \"Smash Bros.\" scene has been noted for its uneasy relationship with Nintendo, the series' owner and publisher. IGN journalist Matt Kim has noted how \"Unlike companies like Riot or Blizzard, who work directly to manage the competitive scene built up around their games, Nintendo has studiously distanced itself, and even actively worked against a community that loves its fighting games.\" Nintendo has threatened legal action against several major \"Smash Bros.\" tournaments in the past, including EVO 2013 and The Big House 10, often over livestreaming rights or due to the usage of mods in the tournament, such as \"Project M\" or Project Slippi. These incidents have received a largely negative reaction from competitive players, and have sometimes resulted in the tournaments not being livestreamed or even being outright cancelled by tournament organizers. While Nintendo has occasionally sponsored community-organized tournaments, and has held its own promotional tournaments utilizing non-standardized rulesets, it has never officially licensed a \"Smash Bros.\" tournament or contributed financially to a prize pot. Nintendo's lack of support has contributed to the competitive \"Smash Bros.\" community's reputation as grassroots and community-driven. However, in November 2021, Nintendo and Panda jointly announced the first officially licensed \"Smash Bros.\" tournament circuit for North America in 2022. A separate grassroots tournament global circuit, the Smash World Tour, ran throughout 2022, with the finals expected to take place in December 2022. However, legal action from Nintendo and potential sabotage from Panda Global resulted in the finals being cancelled just 3 weeks before their scheduled date. The move was estimated to have cost tournament organizers hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of loss.\nCompetitive \"Smash Bros.\" culture has also been criticized by series creator and director Masahiro Sakurai, who has argued that competitive play strays from his original vision for the series of bridging the gap between casual and skilled players. Sakurai's aversion to catering to competitive players greatly influenced the development and gameplay of \"Brawl\", the successor to \"Melee\", which was widely criticized by many competitive players for its deliberately slower and more casual gameplay. The competitive discontent with \"Brawl\" later spurred the development of \"Project M/Project+\", an emulated fan mod to make the game's gameplay more resemble that of \"Melee\"'s. \"Project M/Project+\" has also found itself at the center of legal action by Nintendo due to its dubious copyright legality, with many tournaments having received cease and desist notices from Nintendo upon including the mod in their game lineups.\nFormer Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé defended Nintendo's history of distancing itself from the competitive community, saying that \"We want to do this much more at a grassroots level than others’ visions around leagues and big up-front payments and things of that nature.”\nCompetitive format.\nGames played using competitive rules are generally played with lives (known as \"stocks\" in-game), with the timer set, and items turned off. It is played either Double-elimination format, or a double-elimination bracket seeded from pools.\n\"Melee\" and \"Project M\" start with four stocks and an eight-minute time limit; the original \"Super Smash Bros.\" likewise starts with four stocks and eight-minute time limit (with the time limit being modded in due to the base game not providing a time limit option); \"Brawl\" starts with three stocks and an eight-minute time limit; \"3DS/Wii U\" with two and a six-minute time limit; and \"Ultimate\" with three stocks and a seven-minute time limit.\nIf the time runs out, the winner is determined by whoever has more stocks left; if both players have the same number of stocks, then winner is determined by whoever has the lower damage percentage. If both players have the same number of stocks and amount of damage, then, depending on the tournament, the whole match must be played again, or a shorter match with a single stock each is played. In competitive play, Sudden Death is usually ignored should the match end in a tie. \nPausing can disrupt the gameplay; thus, if a player pauses while in the middle of a match to gain an advantage, then that player must forfeit a stock or the game. In stricter tournaments, the player must forfeit a stock regardless of advantage (or lack thereof), though the pause function is usually disabled in these tournaments. To facilitate this, each game in the series starting with \"Melee\" includes a ruleset option to toggle pausing on or off.\nMost matches are played in best-of-three game sets. Best-of-five sets are played anywhere from top 32 to grand finals.\nThere are stages that are deemed legal by the tournament organizers; these stages are starter stages. Players strike the starter stages before a match to determine the first stage they will play on; also, players must choose their characters without the other person's knowledge for the first match. In subsequent matches there are also counterpick stages allowed. For instance, in \"Melee\" singles, the starter stages are Battlefield, Final Destination, Dream Land N64, Yoshi's Story, and Fountain of Dreams. Players use a 1-2-1 format to strike which stages they do not want to play on until one is left. Once the first match is complete, the losing player can choose any of the starter stages or he or she can also choose a counterpick stage – in this case, Pokémon Stadium. After the first match is complete, the losing player chooses a stage, then the winning player chooses his or her character, then the losing player chooses his or her character before heading to subsequent matches. In best-of-3 sets, the winner can ban one stage so the losing player cannot choose that stage. Generally, players cannot select a stage on which they have previously won; this rule is known as \"Dave's Stupid Rule\" or the \"Stage Clause\". While most Melee-tournaments are running Dave's stupid rule, most Ultimate tournaments are using a variant of the clause, known as \"modified Dave's Stupid Rule\", or mDSR. In mDSR tournaments, players are only barred from selecting the last stage they've won on in that set. Most tournaments allow the players to forgo these rules if both players agree to it. This is known as the gentlemen's clause. Juan \"Hungrybox\" Debiedma is a notable user of the gentlemen's clause in competitive Melee, as he will often offer to gentleman to Battlefield, rather than to play on Fountain of Dreams, one of the games less popular stages.\nCompetitive play may be either singles or doubles. In singles, two players face off against each other. In doubles, two teams of two players fight each other. Sharing stocks with teammates is allowed. Friendly fire is enabled, so teammates can damage or save each other. This is to ensure fairness, as certain combinations of characters in teams can prove to be overpowered. It also ensures that two-on-one situations aren't overwhelmingly tilted in the winning team's favor. It also adds a couple of extra strategies. For example, after a Jigglypuff player uses the move \"Rest\", which immobilizes it for several seconds or until attacked, a teammate could attack Jigglypuff with a weak move, preventing an opponent from causing more damage. \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" adds an 8-player mode, which allows triples and quadruples teams, although there have been comparatively few such tournaments. In \"Ultimate\", many tournaments have held side-events using a game mode called 'Squad Strike', which is a game mode that enables players to fight against each other with a squad of either 3 or 5 fighters.\nIn addition, a player gets port priority when he or she wins in a best-of-one of, usually, rock-paper-scissors. Smasher Mew2King found out that the player who is player 1 or is closest to player 1 has priority in attacks that hit each other at the same time. Also, a neutral start may be enacted if a player suggests it.\nIn some \"Brawl\" rulesets, Meta Knight is either banned from certain stages or is completely banned from tournaments due to the overpowered nature of his attacks. While in certain doubles rulesets, certain team compositions are banned, such as double Cloud in \"Wii U\" and double Meta Knight in \"Brawl\", due to synergy and overpowered attack and strategies that are more effective with additional fighters.\nWombo Combo meme.\n\"Wombo Combo\" is an Internet meme from a December 2008 \"Melee\" doubles match that took place at the SCSA West Coast Circuit tournament. The match featured Jeff \"SilentSpectre\" Leung and Mitchell Tang on one team and Julian Zhu and Joey \"Lucky\" Aldama on the other. In the match, as Lucky lost all of his lives, SilentSpectre and Tang then performed several moves in tandem which removed Zhu's ability to respond. The commentators of the match – Brandon \"HomeMadeWaffles\" Collier, Phil DeBerry, and Joseph \"Mang0\" Marquez – exclaimed \"Happy Feet, Wombo Combo. That ain't Falco\". They then screamed wildly as SilentSpectre and Tang locked Zhu in a game-winning combo. The meme is the subject of a mini documentary, and is one of the memes seen in the Wii U eShop game \"Meme Run\". It has also been used in many \"MLG Montage\" parody videos.\nSexual abuse allegations.\nIn July 2020, several high-profile members of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" competitive community, including top players and commentators, were accused of various forms of sexual misconduct. These included allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, and child grooming. The wave of allegations led to the banning of several notable community figures from tournaments and many organizations dropping their sponsorships of accused players, one notable example being Gonzalo \"ZeRo\" Barrios, considered the best \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" player of all time. Nintendo released a statement responding to the allegations, condemning \"all acts of violence, harassment, and exploitation against anyone and that we stand with the victims\"."

        "text": "Final Boss (known earlier as Shoot to Kill and Team 3D) was a professional esports team that competed in \"Halo\" competitions sponsored by Major League Gaming (MLG) and other tournaments. With its most successful lineups consisting of a core of Dan \"Ogre 1\" Ryan, Tom \"Ogre 2\" Ryan and Dave \"Walshy\" Walsh, Final Boss is regarded as one of the best \"Halo\" teams of all time due to their numerous tournament victories and MLG National Championships from 2004 to 2010. They also hold the record for the longest consecutive event winning streak, with 8 straight tournament victories from 2005 into 2006.\nFormer team members include Dave \"Walshy\" Walsh, Tom \"OGRE 2\" Ryan, Dan \"OGRE 1\" Ryan, Ryan \"Saiyan\" Danford, Michael \"StrongSide\" Cavanaugh and Justin \"iGotUrPistola\" Deese. NBA player Gilbert Arenas was once a sponsor of the team.\nFinal Boss was one of the professional teams that competed on the Boost Mobile Major League Gaming Pro Circuit that aired on USA Network in 2006. After several years of competing in \"Halo 3\" and later \"Halo: Reach\", Final Boss disbanded in 2011. In 2014, Ogre 2 revived the Shoot to Kill name for his \"\" team, but the name was short-lived as the team was soon acquired by esports organization Counter Logic Gaming.\nOgre 2 has also fielded Final Boss teams in \"Call of Duty\" and \"Shadowrun\" MLG tournaments.\nHistory.\n\"Halo 2\".\nThe original lineup of Final Boss was first formed as Shoot to Kill (StK) in 2005, at the beginning of the inaugural MLG \"Halo 2\" season. With a roster of the Ogre twins Dan and Tom Ryan alongside Dave \"Walshy\" Walsh and Ryan \"Saiyan\" Danford, StK came in first at the five events it attended. The team then became sponsored by esports organization Team 3D and changed its name to Team 3D to reflect this. After their rebranding the team won five of the next six events.\nIn April 2006, Team 3D parted ways with the players and for the first time, the team took the name of Final Boss. They continued their four event winning streak into 2006, making it eight in a row before being dethroned by Carbon. The eight event streak stands as the longest winning streak in MLG history. Carbon defeated Final Boss in three straight events to close out the season, marking the first year the Ogre twins and Walshy had not won the MLG National Championship.\nFinal Boss made a team change for the 2007 season, dropping founding member Saiyan for Michael \"StrongSide\" Cavanaugh. The change proved to be fruitful, as Final Boss went on to win five of the seven tournaments in 2007, including the National Championships, to close out \"Halo 2\" as the undisputed kings.\n\"Halo 3\".\nFinal Boss started \"Halo 3\" out on a good note, winning the inaugural event of the 2008 season, but things went downhill from there. After finishing 7th and 5th in back to back events, the Ogres made the controversial decision to drop Walshy and pick up Mason \"Neighbor\" Cobb. After this move they improved, going on to place third in both Toronto and Dallas before finishing 4th at the National Championships.\n2009 brought massive changes. Ogre 1 left the team, leaving Ogre 2 as the only remaining member of the original line up. The other team members were Justin \"Fearitself\" Kats, Joseph \"Mackeo\" Reinhart, and Cameron \"Victory X\" Thorlakson.

        "text": "Coal Mining.\nThe coal industry came to Kent in 1912 and Betteshanger Colliery started production in 1927 and was the largest of the Kent collieries. It was the last Kent colliery to close, closing for good in 1989. The colliery was served by a railway branch which left the main line between Deal &amp; Sandwich.\nBetteshanger History.\nRugby was first played at Betteshanger (The Colliers) in 1936, and was disbanded in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. The club reformed in season 1948-49 when the Yorkshire and Lancashire rugby league enthusiasts combined with the Welsh exiles. The Colliers were highly respected throughout their 57-year history winning county 7’s championship twice, as well as Kent 2, Kent 1 and London Div.4 SE.\nDeal Wanderers History.\nDeal Wanderers started life as Walmer Wanderers in season 1958-59. The change of name came in season 1960-61 when it separated from the cricket section. Wanderers won Kent Div.3 in the 2004-2005 Season, which was a fitting prelude of what the future had in store.\nDeal &amp; Betteshanger History.\nFollowing closure of Betteshanger Colliery and the RM barracks both clubs found themselves competing for an ever-decreasing pool of players and in 2004 the two clubs engaged in discussion about amalgamation. Although they had very different backgrounds and histories the joining of the clubs was the right decision and in 2006 Deal and Betteshanger Lions RFC was born, and has proved very successful.\nThe Club is one of the very few sides at Level 7 that play predominantly home grown talent blended with a few players that have moved into the area. The club endeavours to field three regular senior sides. The club also has a thriving mini’s and junior section where we coach all children from 6 to 17 years. The coaches work hard to ensure the clubs ethos of teamwork, respect, enjoyment and discipline, are values to be aspired to at all times. Deal and Betteshanger was one of the first Rugby Clubs in East Kent to be awarded the coveted “Seal of Approval”.\nRoyal Marines School of Music Barracks Bombing.\nThe rugby club had a strong association with the Royal Marines School of Music, then barracked in Walmer, and the tragic IRA bombing in 1989 killed 11 students, several of whom played for the Wanderers. The community of Deal &amp; Walmer was distraught and in commemoration of that day, an annual rugby match takes place, alternately hosted by the Lions at The Drill Field and by the Royal Marines Band Service in Portsmouth.\nJunior Rugby.\nThe club runs a thriving Youth section, made up of a minis with age groups from 6 to 11 year olds and Juniors with age groups from 12 to 17 years old. Training and matches take place on Sunday mornings from 10.00am\nSaracens Partnership.\nFor the start of the 2015-2016 Deal &amp; Betteshanger rugby club have become a partner club with Saracens. Saracens provide club visits as well as lectures and pro sessions along with providing an opportunity for Youth players to take part in fixtures at Allianz Park Stadium on the 4G pitch itself while the crowd builds for the game.\nCBRE All Schools Partnership.\nFor the start of the 2016-2017 Deal &amp; Betteshanger rugby club are part of the CBRE All Schools Partnership, along with Deal school Goodwin Academy. The rugby club provides the ground for training and any matches which the school take part in. The Deal &amp; Betteshanger club logo is shown on the school rugby shirts.\nClub Alumni.\nSeveral players have come through the junior section at Deal &amp; Betteshanger and moved into professional positions within rugby. These include Matthew Carley, a professional RFU coach, Danny Herriott who played for England U21 and Northampton Saints, Ross Widdett who played for 2022 Mid-American RFU (MARFU) winners St Louis Bombers and Archie English who went to Hartpury College, represented Kent in men's and now plays for Blackheath F.C."

It was the culmination of the 2000 Women's Cricket World Cup, the seventh Women's Cricket World Cup. New Zealand won by 4 runs, clinching their first World Cup title, after finishing as runners-up in both the 1993 and 1997 tournaments. Rick Eyre of \"ESPNcricinfo\" suggested that it was \"the greatest World Cup final ever.\"\nAustralia and New Zealand finished first and second in the round-robin group stage of the tournament, and then won their respective semi-finals against South Africa and India to meet in the final for the second consecutive tournament.\nNew Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first, but according to Eyre, they \"crumbled to be all out\" for 184 runs. Kathryn Ramel scored the most runs for New Zealand, accruing 41 from 63 deliveries, while Terry McGregor bowled particularly economically for Australia. In their response, Australia lost the early wickets of Lisa Keightley and Karen Rolton, but Belinda Clark remained at the crease, and scored 91 runs before being bowled in the 42nd over. Australia kept losing wickets, and from the first ball of the final over, requiring five more runs to win, Charmaine Mason was caught behind, leaving Australia all out for 180. Katrina Keenan, Clare Nicholson and Rachel Pullar took two wickets apiece for New Zealand, with Keenan in particular restricting the run-rate effectively. Clark's batting, which accounted for three fifths of the runs scored while she was at the crease, led her to be presented with the player of the match award."

        "text": "Steve Forbes (born March 22, 1965) is an American men's college basketball head coach for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. His Division I experience includes five years at East Tennessee State, two seasons at Texas A&amp;M, one year at Illinois State, three years at Louisiana Tech, and two years at Idaho.\nEarly life.\nA native of Lone Tree, Iowa, Forbes graduated from Southern Arkansas University with a degree in secondary education in 1988. A former baseball student-athlete for the Muleriders, Forbes spent one year at his alma mater as the sports information director before embarking on a coaching career.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nAfter spending two years (1989–91) as an assistant coach at Southwestern Community College in Creston, Iowa, Forbes was promoted to head coach in March 1991. In 1993 Forbes started coaching as an assistant at Barton County Community College in Great Bend, Kansas, and then was promoted to the head coach of the team in 1995. During his three seasons competing in the Jayhawk Conference, the Cougars produced three All-Americas, twice finished the season with a national ranking and earned victories over 15 nationally-ranked teams. Overall, he compiled a 68-28 record in three years (1995–98) as the head coach of the Cougars.\nIn 1998 Forbes joined the Idaho coaching staff as an assistant coach before being promoted to associate head coach for the 1998-99 season. In his first season, the Vandals improved to 16-11 and signed a nationally-ranked recruiting class.\nForbes spent three years at Louisiana Tech (2000–03), where he helped sign two nationally-ranked recruiting classes, including a top-10 class in 2003. In 2002 the Bulldogs posted a 22-10 record and went 2-1 in the National Invitation Tournament, their first postseason appearance in 10 years. He also coached at Illinois State (2003–04) before joining Billy Gillispie's coaching staff at Texas A&amp;M.\nTexas A&amp;M.\nIn 2004 Forbes started coaching as an assistant coach at Texas A&amp;M under Billy Gillispie. He helped turn the Aggies from a team that had posted a 7-21 record the previous season and hadn't received a postseason invitation in 11 years, to a program that averaged more than 21 wins in his two seasons and advanced to postseason play both years.\nA&amp;M posted back-to-back seasons with the most Big 12 Conference wins in school history with Forbes on the bench. Picked to finish last in the Big 12 prior to the 2004-05 season, the Aggies won their first 11 games and went on to a 21-10 record and made an appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. In 2005-06, Texas A&amp;M advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987 while recording a 22-9 record, the third-most wins in school history. The Aggies defeated Syracuse in the first round of the NCAA Tournament before falling to eventual Final Four participant LSU on a last-second shot.\nTexas A&amp;M's recruiting also benefited from Forbes' experience, as each of the Aggie's two recruiting classes during his time in College Station were ranked among the top 10 in the nation.\nTennessee.\nAfter spending two seasons at Texas A&amp;M, Forbes came to Tennessee in 2006 as an assistant coach under Bruce Pearl. In the five seasons at Tennessee, Forbes helped coach the Vols to an average of 26 wins per year, and advanced to five consecutive NCAA Tournaments – making three Sweet Sixteen appearances and advancing to the program's first-ever Elite Eight in 2010.\nTennessee won a school-record 31 games in 2008, and their 14-2 league record gave the program its first outright SEC championship in more than 40 years. Following a 66-62 win at top-ranked Memphis on February 23, 2008, UT earned the first No. 1 ranking in school history.\nForbes’ experience also helped Tennessee's 2006, 2008 and 2010 recruiting classes to a top 10 national ranking by multiple ratings services. In 2011 Forbes moved on from the Tennessee program when Bruce Pearl and his staff (including Forbes) were fired amidst NCAA recruiting violations committed by Pearl.\nNorthwest Florida State.\nIn 2011, the same year Forbes was fired from Tennessee, he was hired by Northwest Florida State, a junior college, as the head coach of their program. During his two-year tenure in Niceville, Florida, he coached the Raiders to a 62-6 record and had five of his junior college players transfer to Division I schools in the offseason.\nWichita State.\nForbes' performance at Northwest Florida State caught the attention of Wichita State Shockers head basketball coach Gregg Marshall, who hired him as an assistant in 2013. At Wichita State, Forbes helped coach the Shockers to two of the most successful seasons in program history.\nIn 2013-14, Wichita State won an NCAA record 35-straight games before losing to eventual National Runner-up Kentucky in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. The Shockers' 35-1 record also shattered all of WSU's and the MVC's winning streak records, including Indiana State's 33-game record in 1977. WSU entered the NCAA Tournament as a No. 1 seed, a first for the program.\nIn 2014-15, Wichita State went 30-5 on the season and recorded its third consecutive season of 30 wins or more. The No. 7-seeded Shockers advanced to the Sweet 16 before falling to No. 3 seed and ACC champion Notre Dame.\nEast Tennessee State.\nOn March 30, 2015, Forbes was named the new head coach of the East Tennessee State men's basketball team. He was the 16th head coach in the program’s 95-year history, and was hired after former coach Murry Bartow was let go. His recruiting ties and his extensive background as an assistant coach at the NCAA Division I level made him the perfect fit for the ETSU program according to the school's athletic director, Dr. Richard Sander.\nThe hiring of Forbes was named one of the best offseason coaching hires of 2015 by CBS Sports. Forbes secured his first signature win on November 22, 2015 defeating Georgia Tech in Atlanta by a score of 69-68. On March 4, 2020, Forbes was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year. \nIn his final season at ETSU (2019-20), Forbes’ team beat LSU on the road in convincing fashion, won the Southern Conference and conference tournament, and set a school record for wins (30-4 overall) that also marked the first and only 30-win season in school history. ETSU gained attention as a potential bracket-busting team in the NCAA tournament (before it was ultimately cancelled to due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nWake Forest.\nOn April 30, 2020, Forbes was hired as head coach at Wake Forest University by John Currie, replacing Danny Manning. After his second season at Wake Forest, Forbes was named the ACC Coach of the Year for 2021-22.\nPersonal life.\nForbes and his wife, Johnetta, have three children: Elizabeth, Christopher, and Johnathon."

        "text": "The Big Ten Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year is a basketball award given to the Big Ten Conference's most outstanding player. The award was first given following the Big Ten's first full season of women's basketball in 1982–83 (although the conference held its first postseason tournament the previous season). The league's head coaches have presented the award since 1983; media members who cover Big Ten women's basketball began presenting their own version of the award in 1996.\nTen players have won the award multiple times. Six players have won twice: Anucha Browne of Northwestern (1984, 1985), Tracey Hall of Ohio State (1986, 1987), Katie Douglas of Purdue (2000, 2001), Kelly Mazzante of Penn State (2003, 2004), Maggie Lucas of Penn State (2013, 2014), and Megan Gustafson of Iowa (2018, 2019). Four players have won more than two awards. Ohio State's Jantel Lavender is the only four-time winner (2008–2011), though only the 2009 and 2010 awards were unanimous (she won the coaches' award in 2008 and the media award in 2011). Jessica Davenport, also of Ohio State, and Caitlin Clark of Iowa are the only players to have been the unanimous winner of three awards (Davenport: 2005–2007; Clark: 2022–2024). Ohio State's other three-time winner, Kelsey Mitchell, won the coaches' award in 2015 and 2018 and both awards in 2017.\nFive players have won a major national player of the year award in the same season in which they were Big Ten Player of the Year. Michelle Edwards of Iowa won the Rawlings/Women Basketball Coaches Association national player of the year award in 1988; Carol Ann Shudlick of Minnesota won the Wade Trophy in 1994; Stephanie White of Purdue won the Wade Trophy and Honda Award in 1999; Megan Gustafson won the Naismith and Honda Awards in 2019, and was also named national player of the year by AP and the United States Basketball Writers Association; and Caitlin Clark won all significant national awards in both 2023 and 2024.\nThe coaches and media have split their honors six times in all, with the most recent being 2018, when Mitchell won the coaches' award and Gustafson won the media award.\nOhio State has the record for the most awards with 15, and the most individuals who have won the award, with seven. Of current Big Ten Conference members, three schools have never had a winner: long-established member Indiana, and the two schools that joined the conference in 2014, Maryland and Rutgers."

        "text": "The women's rugby sevens tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics was held in Brazil, hosted at the Deodoro Stadium, a temporary outdoor stadium constructed as part of the Deodoro Modern Pentathlon Park in Rio de Janeiro. The tournament was held from 6 August to 8 August 2016, starting with group matches before finishing with the medal ceremony on 8 August.\nAustralia beat New Zealand 24–17 in the final. Canada secured the bronze medal with a win over Great Britain.\nQualification.\nWith Brazil being the hosts, their team automatically qualified despite their sevens team not regularly appearing in the top 6 on the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. The 2014–15 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series was the initial stage of qualification, where the top 4 teams at the end of the series gaining qualification to the 2016 Olympic Games. Between June and September 2015, each of the six regional rugby unions held an Olympic qualification event, where one team from each region qualified, bring the total up to 11 team qualified. The final spot was determined by a repechage tournament held in Monaco, where the winner of that event became the final team to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games.\nAs a result of England finishing fourth in the 2014–15 Sevens World Series, Great Britain were awarded a spot in the Olympic games, despite the other nations failing to qualify in the top 4. This is because Great Britain compete as one union in the Olympics and as several in international rugby (England, Wales, Scotland and a combined union from Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland), which meant should one of either the England, Wales or Scotland teams qualify, then Great Britain would be awarded a spot in the Olympic Games. It was decided players based in Northern Ireland were not eligible to represent Great Britain in the rugby sevens tournament as these players represent the IRFU, and the union demanded that Northern Irish players, that have committed to play for the Irish rugby union, only play for Ireland despite being eligible under IOC rules to compete for Great Britain. The three remaining unions agreed in advance of the 2013–14 Sevens World Series that their highest-finishing teams in that season would represent all three unions in the first stage of qualification.\nMatch officials.\nOn 11 April 2016, World Rugby announced a panel of twelve match officials for the women's sevens. Two Brazilians were later added as assistant referees.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the tournament took place on 28 June 2016. The 12 teams were seeded based on their points they have accumulated over the past two seasons on the Women's Sevens Series circuit. The four teams that qualified directly from the 2014–15 Women's Sevens World Series were guaranteed a top four seeding, with their positioning determined by their combined score over the two seasons.\nPool stage.\nGroup winners and runners-up advance to the quarter-finals. Third place teams drop to a third-placed teams table, where the top two third placed teams advance to the quarter-finals.\nPool A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\nPool B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5 /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nPool C.\n&lt;section begin=C /&gt;&lt;section end=C /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C3 /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C4 /&gt;&lt;section end=C4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C5 /&gt;&lt;section end=C5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C6 /&gt;&lt;section end=C6 /&gt;\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe top two of the third-placed teams advance to the knockout rounds.\nKnockout stage.\n9–12th place playoff.\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\n11th place.\n&lt;section begin=E3 /&gt;&lt;section end=E3 /&gt;\n9th place final.\n&lt;section begin=E4 /&gt;&lt;section end=E4 /&gt;\n5–8th place playoff.\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=F1 /&gt;&lt;section end=F1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=F2 /&gt;&lt;section end=F2 /&gt;\n7th place.\n&lt;section begin=F3 /&gt;&lt;section end=F3 /&gt;\n5th place final.\n&lt;section begin=F4 /&gt;&lt;section end=F4 /&gt;\nMedal playoff.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D4 /&gt;&lt;section end=D4 /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=G1 /&gt;&lt;section end=G1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=G2 /&gt;&lt;section end=G2 /&gt;\nBronze medal match.\n&lt;section begin=H1 /&gt;&lt;section end=H1 /&gt;\nGold medal match.\n&lt;section begin=H2 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=H2 /&gt;"

        "text": "The Navy Midshipmen women's lacrosse team is an NCAA Division I college lacrosse team representing the United States Naval Academy as part of the Patriot League. They play their home games at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland.\nHead coach.\nThe Midshipmen are led by hall of fame coach Cindy Timchal, who was named the team's inaugural head coach on August 5, 2006, and has guided the team since its 2008 inception. Timchal is the winningest coach in NCAA Division I women's lacrosse history, earning her 500th win on March 31, 2018.\nA 1976 graduate of West Chester University, Timchal began coaching as an assistant lacrosse and field hockey coach at the University of Pennsylvania in 1979. Her first Division I head coach gig was at Northwestern University in 1982. She led the Wildcats to 5 NCAA Tournaments in nine seasons. In 1991 Timchal moved to the University of Maryland, where she transformed a school with one national title in its first eight seasons into a national juggernaut. In 16 seasons, Timchal won eight national titles, reached eleven title games, and made the NCAA Tournament every year.\nTimchal's Midshipmen made an immediate impact. After coaching the club team to an 18–5 record in 2007, Navy made the jump to Division I the next year and has won at least 13 games in each of its first ten seasons. Navy broke through in 2010, capturing the Patriot League title for its first NCAA Tournament appearance. They beat Sacred Heart in the play-in game before falling to North Carolina in the first round to finish the year 17–4 with a #19 national ranking. This began a stretch of four straight conference titles and NCAA appearances. The Midshipmen won play-in games three years in a row from 2010 to 2012 and added a first-round victory over Monmouth in 2013. For those four years, Navy's dominance in the Patriot League was hardly contested—they went 21–3 in league play with three regular season titles and four tournament titles.\nHowever, Loyola joined the league in 2014, led by its own all-star coach, Jen Adams. Adams was Timchal's star player at Maryland from 1998 to 2001, as they had captured four straight national titles together and Adams still holds many Maryland scoring records. Loyola instantly dominated the league, winning three straight conference and tournament titles, preventing the Midshipmen from qualifying again from 2014 to 2016. Loyola completed its fourth straight unbeaten Patriot League regular season in 2017, and faced Navy in the tournament final. The Midshipmen stunned the Greyhounds 15–5, ending Loyola's 41-game unbeaten streak against PL teams. This win kicked off a Cinderella run for the Midshipmen, who defeated three teams in the NCAA tournament--#7 Penn, Massachusetts, and #2 North Carolina—before falling 16–14 to fellow underdog Boston College in the national semifinals. Navy's run marked the first time a women's service academy team had made a Division I national semifinal, and the Midshipmen ended the year 18–5, ranked #4 in the final Inside Lacrosse Media Poll and #6 in the IWLCA Coaches Poll.\nIndividual career records.\nReference:\nPostseason Results.\nThe Midshipmen have appeared in 7 NCAA tournaments. Their postseason record, not including play-in games, is 7–7."

The following two days of racing were normal mass-start stages, before the fourth day of racing consisted of two half-stages, the first a normal stage and the latter a team time trial. The rest of the opening half of the race – remaining within Italy for the duration – consisted of stages with or without categorized climbs.\nJean-François Bernard became the first race leader, as he won the opening stage in Urbino; the first of two stage wins that Bernard achieved during the opening half of the race, along with the eighth stage. As a result, Bernard was the second rider to win multiple stages in the opening half of the race, after Guido Bontempi who won stages 2 and 5. Bernard lost the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () after stage 4a to Massimo Podenzana, who had been a part of a breakaway that survived and finished minutes ahead of the peloton. Podenzana held the lead all the way to the end of the eleventh stage.\nStage 1.\n23 May 1988 — Urbino, \nThe first stage of the 1988 edition of the event was a individual time trial that navigated the streets of Urbino. An \"El Mundo Deportivo\" writer stated that the course was fast. The first were the fastest section of the course because the route was downhill. After the course passed the railroad station in Urbino, the course began to increase slightly in elevation until the finish. The writer also noted two bends, one at Via della Stazione ( in) and the other at Ciale Comandino ( in), which he classified as \"dangerous.\" The first rider was scheduled to start at 13:30 local time.\nGreg LeMond () suffered from a dropped chain halfway through the course, which caused him to post a \"horrible\" time according to \"El País\" writer Luis Gómez. Tony Rominger (), Erik Breukink (), and Erich Maechler () chose to use rear lenticular wheels instead of a traditional wheel with spokes. Rominger came in second overall with a time of 13' 10\", Breukink came in fourth at 13' 15\", and Maechler came in third after finishing with the same time as Breukink. After the stage, Rominger told reporters that his time slower than it could have been due to a fall that occurred due to his front wheel being too inflated. Pedro Delgado (Reynolds), who rode a standard bike, finished in twentieth position, twenty-eight seconds behind stage winner Jean-François Bernard (). Bernard traversed the course with the fastest time of 13' 07\" at a pace of 41.168 km/h. With the time bonuses added to the top three finisher's times, Bernard's lead was increased to eight seconds over Rominger.\nStage 2.\n24 May 1988 — Urbino to Ascoli Piceno, \nThe second stage of the race was one of the longer ones in the race and featured two third category climbs, the Santa Vittoria () and the Valico Croce di Casaleo ().

        "text": "The men's rugby sevens tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics was held in Brazil. It was hosted at the Deodoro Stadium, a temporary outdoor stadium constructed as part of the Deodoro Modern Pentathlon Park in Rio de Janeiro. The tournament was held from 9 August to 11 August 2016, starting with group matches before finishing with the medal ceremony on 11 August. The 2016 Games marked the first time that rugby sevens has been played at the Olympics, and the first time since 1924 that any form of rugby had been played at the Olympics.\nThe gold medal for Fiji represented the first Olympic medal earned by Fiji at any Olympics. Great Britain won silver and South Africa defeated Japan to win the bronze medal.\nQualification.\nWith Brazil being the hosts, their team automatically qualified despite their sevens team not regularly appearing in the World Rugby Sevens Series. The 2014–15 Sevens World Series was the initial stage of qualification, with the top 4 teams at the end of the series gaining qualification to the 2016 Olympic Games. Between June and September 2015, each of the six regional rugby unions held an Olympic qualification event, where one team from each region qualified, bringing the total up to 11 teams qualified. The final spot was determined by a repechage tournament held in Monaco, where the winner of that event became the final team to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games.\nAs a result of England finishing fourth in the 2014–15 Sevens World Series, Great Britain were awarded a spot in the Olympic Games, despite the other nations failing to qualify in the top 4. This is because Great Britain compete as one union in the Olympics and as several in international rugby (Rugby Football Union for England, Welsh Rugby Union, Scottish Rugby Union and the combined Irish Rugby Football Union for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland), which meant should one of either the England, Wales or Scotland teams qualify, then Great Britain would be awarded a spot in the Olympic Games. It was decided players based in Northern Ireland were not eligible to represent Great Britain in the rugby sevens tournament as these players represent the IRFU, and the union demanded that Northern Irish players that have committed to play for the Irish rugby union, only play for Ireland despite being eligible under IOC rules to compete for Great Britain. The three remaining unions agreed in advance of the 2013–14 Sevens World Series that their highest-finishing teams in that season would represent all three unions in the first stage of qualification.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the tournament took place on 28 June 2016. The 12 teams were seeded based on their points they have accumulated over the past two seasons on the Sevens Series circuit. The four teams that qualified directly from the 2014–15 Sevens World Series were guaranteed a top four seeding, with their positioning determined by their combined score over the two seasons.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe men's rugby tournament takes place over three days:\nMatch officials.\nWorld Rugby announced a panel of twelve match officials on 11 April 2016 for the men's sevens. Two Brazilians were later added as assistant referees.\nPool stage.\nIn pool play, each team plays one match against the other three teams in the group. Three points are awarded for a win, two points - for a draw, and one point - for a loss.\nGroup winners and runners-up advance to the quarter-finals. Third place teams drop to a third-placed teams table, where the top two third placed teams advance to the quarter-finals. Rankings are based on competition points; if teams are tied, the next tiebreaker is points difference.\nPool A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\nPool B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5 /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nPool C.\n&lt;section begin=C /&gt;&lt;section end=C /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C3 /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C4 /&gt;&lt;section end=C4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C5 /&gt;&lt;section end=C5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=C6 /&gt;&lt;section end=C6 /&gt;\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe top two of the third-placed teams advance to the knockout rounds.\nKnockout stage.\nThe quarterfinals were scheduled for August 10, with the semifinals and finals scheduled for August 11.\n9–12th place playoff.\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\n11th Place.\n&lt;section begin=E3 /&gt;&lt;section end=E3 /&gt;\n9th Place Final.\n&lt;section begin=E4 /&gt;&lt;section end=E4 /&gt;\n5–8th place playoff.\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=F1 /&gt;&lt;section end=F1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=F2 /&gt;&lt;section end=F2 /&gt;\nSeventh Place.\n&lt;section begin=F3 /&gt;&lt;section end=F3 /&gt;\nFifth Place Final.\n&lt;section begin=F4 /&gt;&lt;section end=F4 /&gt;\nMedal playoff.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=D4 /&gt;&lt;section end=D4 /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;section begin=G1 /&gt;&lt;section end=G1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=G2 /&gt;&lt;section end=G2 /&gt;\nBronze-medal match.\n&lt;section begin=H1 /&gt;&lt;section end=H1 /&gt;\nGold-medal match.\n&lt;section begin=H2 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=H2 /&gt;"

According to surviving records, it had no specific venue and is known to have played at both Hampton Court Green and Moulsey Hurst.\nThe earliest known mention of Hampton as a cricket club is a single wicket match at Moulsey Hurst in August 1726. The contestants were Piper of Hampton and Perry of London Cricket Club. The first mention of Hampton in an eleven-a-side match is against Brentford at Moulsey Hurst in July 1731. The result is unknown but a contemporary newspaper announcement, published a day earlier, states that \"above £500 is already laid on their heads, neither side having ever yet been beat\".\nThe team continued to play until 1771, sometimes as a combined Kingston and Hampton team. The last matches recorded as played by the side were in July 1771 when a combined Hampton, Brentford and Richmond team played two matches against Chertsey Cricket Club at Laleham Burway and at Richmond Green.\nThe club is unrecorded after 1771. It may have disbanded in the later part of the 18th century and there is no definite modern equivalent. The nearest club to Hampton is Hampton Wick Royal Cricket Club in Bushy Park. This club was established in 1863 and is a member of the Surrey Championship."

        "title": "Basketball Without Borders",
        "text": "Basketball Without Borders is a basketball instructional camp organized by the NBA in conjunction with FIBA. It presents itself as a “basketball development and community outreach program that unites young basketball players to promote the sport and encourage positive social change in the areas of education, health, and wellness.”\nOrganized annually since 2001, 41 BWB camps have been held across 23 cities in 20 countries with over 2,300 participants from more than 120 countries and territories, 33 of whom were later drafted into the NBA. Around 150 different current and former NBA/WNBA players have joined nearly 140 NBA team personnel as staff.\nHistory.\nBilled as a “summer camp for 12-14-year-olds designed to promote friendship and understanding through sport,” the initial editions focused on peace and international relations, bringing together youths from former Yugoslavia in 2001 shortly after the Yugoslav Wars and from Greece and Turkey in 2002 amidst tense Greek–Turkish relations, with leading participation from the UN in both cases.\nFrom the 2003 editions onwards, basketball became the focus of the camps. The age of the participants grew (17 on average) and participants are now mostly selected for their potential, although the selection process by FIBA and national federations is an inclusive system that sees consensual selections from weaker basketball countries.\n2003 also saw the first edition of the camp in Africa, seen as uncharted basketball territory at the time. The camps would later expand to the Americas in 2004 and Asia in 2005, including youth from all around the globe (those from Oceania have attended editions in the latter two mentioned regions).\nA global camp was first organized in 2015 in New York City as part of the All-Star Game Weekend, giving an opportunity for selected players, identified as the best in their regions, to have a taste of the game at its highest level. This was announced as an recurring annual event.\nThe camps have gradually become a hotspot for scouts, with an impressive number of former campers who have made it into the NBA (see Attendees) and college basketball. They are seen as a means of spotting unheralded talent with high upside. Players such as Luc Mbah a Moute and Bruno Caboclo are noted examples.\nThough basketball skill is now at the forefront of the camp, the social goal is also still pre-eminent. Few campers are expected to make it as pros and a declared goal of the camp is to develop its attendees life-skills, with an emphasis on leadership and personal relations, to make them leaders of change in their home countries.\nIdeally, the personal goal for them is to enter a high school or college in the U.S. to get an education they can use in the future. In a given year it was estimated more than 60 former participants were playing and studying in American colleges.\nThere is a camp for girls as well with coaches from FIBA and the WNBA; however, it receives far less exposure than the boys tournaments.\nBasketball Without Borders and program director Masai Ujiri are profiled in Hubert Davis's 2016 documentary film \"Giants of Africa\".\nFormat.\nBasketball Without Borders brings together young players (called campers) usually aged 18 and under to a single location for a few days (3 or 4 on average). They are identified by the FIBA, NBA and participating federations with input from international FIBA/ NBA players from the region. For example, some players have been chosen for BWB Africa through Sprite Slam camps in the past.\nThe youths are divided into teams (sometimes after a draft) named after real NBA teams and managed by coaches who are current and former NBA or FIBA players and coaches.\nThey attend daily basketball fundamentals clinics (passing, shooting, dribbling...) with these coaches and participate in individual and/or team shooting games for prizes before playing in tournament-style games against the other teams.\nAlso offered are seminars for the campers to improve their life skills (character, leadership, and health concerns...), normally run by local non-government organizations (NGOs).\nThe camp ends with an All-Star game featuring the camp's best players. Starting in the 2007 edition, a game MVP and a camp-wide MVP are then elected.\nIn parallel the organizers also implement social responsibility programs with daily community outreach activities in the local area such as organizing seminars for local youths or Special Olympics.\nThese are supplemented by product donations to local organizations, such as schools, and usually an NBA Cares initiative such as building or refurbishing playing and educational infrastructures.\nThe NBA and its corporate sponsors pay for transport, lodging and meals for the campers and the entourage of personnel (including a full training staff for injuries). Some of many examples include the La Ghirada center in Treviso that was used in early camps and was leased for free by Benetton Group, the campers in BWB Africa flown in by South African Airways, whilst Nike has outfitted the campers in multiple camps."

        "text": "Anthony Nathaniel Anderson (born November 12, 1981), also known by his initials as Double A, is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Moncton Magic of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). Standing 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), he plays the point guard position. Anderson has played in the NBL Canada with the Riptide and Mill Rats for nearly six seasons. As of February 2016, he is the league's all-time leading scorer and is known as one of its most prominent players. Anderson also played for Saint John and their previous incarnation, the Manchester Millrats, in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) and the American Basketball Association (ABA).\nAnderson played four seasons of college basketball under head coach Steve Lappas at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with the Minutemen. He most notably was named Rookie of the Year for the Atlantic 10 Conference in 2002. He closed his college career at UMass as its second-best three-point shooter in school history, behind only Monty Mack. Anderson attended Lynn English High School in Lynn, Massachusetts before college, where he was one of the top basketball players in the Northeastern Conference.\nAfter leaving UMass, Anderson shortly competed as a rookie with the PAWS London Capital following a brief hiatus in his career, in which he only played locally for personal reasons. He later drew the attention of the Millrats, for whom he would play in the 2007–08 season. Anderson then competed in Cyprus and Poland before returning to Manchester. He remained with the team as they relocated to Saint John and the NBL Canada. Midway through his stint with the Mill Rats, Anderson played in Qatar in 2013. His individual accolades in his professional career include ABA All-Star Game MVP, All-ABA First Team, ABA Most Valuable Player, and third and second-team All-PBL. In the NBL Canada, Anderson has appeared on the All-NBL Canada First Team thrice, made the NBL Canada All-Star Game on two occasions, and was named Most Valuable Player in 2014.\nHigh school career.\nAnderson attended Lynn English High School in Lynn, Massachusetts, where he played basketball under head coach Ronald Bennett. He was named Most Valuable Player of the Northeastern Conference as a junior and senior. In his final season with the team, Anderson averaged 24 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds and led them to a 19–5 record. He was named to the 2000 \"Boston Globe\" All-Scholastic team and became one of the most highly ranked guards in the United States. Bennett said, \"In 35 years, he's the best player I've ever had. He sees the floor so well and can always find the open man.\" Anderson decided to play college basketball for the UMass Minutemen over Florida State, Villanova, and St. John's. He verbally committed to play for UMass and became eligible after initial struggles with his SAT scores.\nCollege career.\nFreshman.\nAnderson quickly became a key part of the Minutemen as a freshman, starting in 26 of the team's 29 games. He had personal ties with teammate Shannon Crooks, who was brought up in the same area of Massachusetts. According to head coach Steve Lappas, Crooks helped Anderson adjust to the college level. Lappas said, \"I think he helped Anthony a lot. They're both from Boston so they have a little kinship there and they're pretty close so I think he definitely helped him.\" On November 16, 2011, Anderson took part in his first official collegiate game against Arkansas–Little Rock, scoring 10 points, grabbing 5 rebounds, and recording 4 assists. He played a team-high 37 minutes as the Minutemen won the game, 66–60. In the days that followed, the point guard would earn Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie of the Week honors. On December 4, 2011, Anderson posted career-highs of 13 points and 7 assists vs. Holy Cross. He eclipsed the scoring total in his following game against Boston College, in which he recorded a team-high 19 points. In this game, Anderson hit three three-pointers in the closing 15.2 seconds, but he could not lead his team to the victory. On January 29, 2002, in a loss to Dayton, Anderson scored a season-high 20 points and made 6 of 7 three-pointers. He became the first Minuteman to record over 5 threes that season and scored double figures for the 10th time as a freshman. In mid-February 2002, Anderson was named co-WHMP/UMass Athlete of the Week after scoring 14 and 11 points against Duquesne and La Salle respectively. By the end of the season, he was averaging 10.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.1 steals. Anderson finished his freshman year by being named Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Week four times—a league-high—and ultimately earned conference All-Rookie and Rookie of the Year honors. He became the fourth Minuteman of all-time to be Freshman, Rookie, or Newcomer of the Year and the first since Marcus Camby in 1994. At the team banquet, Anderson won the Mark Donoghue Most Productive Player Award for \"having numbers in every category.\"\nSophomore.\nAnderson opened his sophomore season against the Indiana Hoosiers, scoring 2 points and going 0-of-6 on three-pointers as his team fell, 71–84. However, he led his team with 20 points two games later, in a 14-point win over Chaminade. Anderson said, \"I feel like if I'm not scoring I can't get anybody else into the game either. But today I was hitting shots, so I could do other things, like penetrate and kick out to guys.\" He finished the game with a career-high 9 assists as well. On December 14, 2002, against the Florida International Panthers, Anderson surpassed the 20-point mark for the second time. He was praised by Lappas, \"When Anthony plays well, we can win a game ugly. When he doesn't, we can't win at all.\" Anderson topped his previous scoring record on January 2, 2003, when he posted 25 points vs. NC State and helped his team capture the victory. He also recorded a career-high 9 rebounds. This performance led to Anderson being named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week. The point guard matched his season-best on February 23, 2003, when he scored 25 points against Duquesne and shot 10-of-13 from the field. After completing his sophomore season, Anderson was averaging 11.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.3 steals, and 2.6 three-pointers. He was his team's leader in minutes and three-pointers and ranked second in points. Anderson recorded more than 100 assists for the second straight season, becoming the first to do so since 1999. He also made the eighth-most single-season threes in school history.\nJunior.\nHeading into his junior year, Anderson was named preseason third-team All-Atlantic 10. He became known as the entrenched starting point guard for UMass and was named team captain. He posted a team-high 21 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists in his debut vs. St. Francis (NY). Anderson notched a career-high 29 points on December 2, against Vermont, connecting on 7 of his 9 three-point attempts. He was the first Minuteman to accomplish the feat since Monty Mack in March 2001. Anderson also recorded the seventh-most three-pointers in a single game in school history. He said, \"When you see a guy hit a couple shots you might want to run a play to get that guy open. So it definitely helps out a lot, it makes it way easier for me.\" Following another 20-point effort vs. Boston College and a season-best 9 rebounds, he was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week and Dinn Brothers UMass Athlete of the Week.\nAnderson was effective from beyond the arc once more against St. Bonaventure, hitting 6 threes en route to 26 points, although his team lost. He led his team in rebounds as well, with 8. On March 6, 2004, Anderson recorded 9 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists in his team's final regular season game vs. Richmond, scoring his 1,000th point for UMass. He became the 36th Minuteman to join the 1,000-point club and the first since former teammate Shannon Crooks in 2002. Anderson closed out the season with 7 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists in an Atlantic 10 tournament defeat to Duquesne. He finished the year averaging 12.9 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.5 steals. At the team banquet, he received the Rick Pitino Assist Award and the Jim Laughnane Free Throw Award. He recorded the third-most three-pointers and seventh-most assists in school history. He also had the sixth-highest minutes per game average for a Minuteman.\nSenior.\nAnderson opened his senior stint on November 23, 2004, with 14 points, 3 assists, and 5 steals against Birmingham–Southern. In his next appearance vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, \"What else do you say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its great to see Anthony have six points in the game and win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good for him to go out there and play and direct these kids that he has out there under him.\" In mid-December 2004, Anderson was suspended for three games after failing a drug test. Lappas called it a \"violation of team rules.\"\nFollowing his return, Anderson scored a season-high 23 points against Fordham on January 19, 2005. He represented UMass for the 100th time on January 22 vs. Saint Joseph's, as he recorded 16 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists. On February 12, he scored 4 points to become the 20th-best scorer in school history. However, he suffered from back injuries that would keep him from playing in five games and the Atlantic 10 tournament. After his senior year, Anderson was averaging 10.2 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.9 steals, and 2.4 three-pointers. He finished his collegiate career with the second-most threes, the third-most steals, the fifth-highest three-point field goal percentage, the seventh-most assists, and the 19th most points in school history. In 2010, Ricky Harris passed Anderson for the second-most three-pointers in Minutemen history, with 276.\nProfessional career.\nEarly pro years (2007–2008).\nFollowing his graduation, Anderson returned to his alma mater and began serving as an assistant coach at Lynn English High School under Buzzy Barton. He could not join a professional team because of family problems and worked as a debt collector to support his family. Instead, Anderson competed in Boston Weekend League and became a prominent streetball player in the area. In August 2007, Anderson drew the attention of Steve Bucknall, head coach of the PAWS London Capital of the British Basketball League (BBL), when he took part in a local summer basketball tournament known as the Hoganz Basketball Classic. At the event, Anderson scored 51 points against Detroit Pistons player Will Blalock and led his Lynn-based team to the championship by hitting a buzzer-beating three-pointer in the finals. Later in the month, Anderson signed his first professional contract with London Capital for the team's inaugural season. He commented on his move to the new country, \"England was by far the worst situation I ever been in since playing overseas.\" Anderson also experienced culture shock while living there. In his time with London Capital, he most notably scored 32 points in a single game.\nOn November 12, 2007, Anderson returned to the United States and was signed by the Manchester Millrats of the American Basketball Association (ABA). General manager Ian McCarthy said, \"Anthony gives us another super-talented point guard who can also break down the defense and really light up the scoreboard.\" Anderson was unable to play in the team's first game due to a bruised collar bone. By January 1, 2008, Anderson was averaging 32.4 points per game. In mid-February, he was averaging 22.8 points, shooting 69% from the field and 48% on three-pointers.

He made all 10 of his two-point shots and was 17-of-23 from the field. ProBasketballNews.com ranked him the top ABA player and the third-best minor league basketball player in the country, above players such as Ian Mahinmi, Eddie Gill, and Elton Brown. On March 17, Anderson was named to the ABA All-Star Game. He scored 19 points in the first half of the game, propelling his East team to an 18-point lead at halftime. His game-high 33 points helped him win the Halogen Records ABA All-Star Most Valuable Player Award. Manchester owner Jason Briggs said, \"We are very proud of Anthony. He is a super-star in the making and he has a great work ethic and is very humble to boot.\" On April 1, 2008, Anderson was named first-team All-ABA and won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. On March 19, 2010, he was named second-team ABA All-Decade, an award for the top players in the league from 2000 to 2009.\nOverseas ventures (2008–2010).\nAnderson's strong performance in his rookie season helped him participate in a three-day tryout for the NBA's Indiana Pacers in June 2008. He expected to take part in the team's training camp, but a trade involving Jarrett Jack and T. J. Ford led him to never receive the invitation. On August 9, 2008, Anderson signed a contract with AEK Larnaca B.C. of the Cyprus Basketball Division 1. He finished the season averaging 17.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.2 assists, with the second-most assists in the league and the most points. In an interview with SLAM Online, Anderson said, \"It was very good competition. It's just like when you see European guys in the NBA. There are a lot of skilled and crafty players, not overly athletic but very skilled.\" He played against players such as Bradley Buckman while in Cyprus. After the season concluded, Eurobasket.com named Anderson 2nd Team All-Cyprus League.\nOn August 21, 2009, Anderson signed with the Polish club Sportino Inowrocław of the Tauron Basket Liga. He debuted with his new team on October 10, 2009, when he recorded 13 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 assists vs. Polpharma Starogard Gdański.

On November 8, he notched a season-best 17 points and matched his record of 6 assists against Asseco Prokom Gdynia. Anderson played only 7 minutes in his final game with Sportino Inowrocław, scoring 0 points. He capped his career in the Polish League averaging 9.9 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in 28.5 minutes per game.\nReturn to Manchester (2010–2011).\nAnderson returned to the Manchester Millrats in 2010, after the team joined the Premier Basketball League (PBL). In January, he averaged 23.4 points and shot .600 from the floor in 7 appearances. By February 3, 2010, he led the league in scoring and assists. At this time, Anderson was evaluated by Trotamundos de Carabobo of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto (LPB) in Venezuela and was expected to sign the overseas contract. However, he would never play for the team. He then returned to the Manchester Millrats and made his first appearance since the tryout on February 20, 2010, making a buzzer-beating jumper to top the Vermont Frost Heaves. The next day, Anderson scored 23 points against Puerto Rico Capitanes, the combined performances helping him win Player of the Week honors. In late March, Anderson was named to the PBL All-Star Game with teammate Stanley Ocitti. He was leading the Millrats in scoring, averaging 20.2 points per game, assists, and three-pointers. By the end of the season, he was also named third-team All-League.\nAnderson came back for another PBL season with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2011.

However, on January 3, 2012, Anderson injured his hand in a defeat to the Moncton Miracles and was expected to be sidelined for three to four weeks. General manager Ian McCarthy said, \"This really stung because we were unable to finish the game strong against Moncton with Anthony out, and now we have a road game 48 hours later against a tough Quebec team.\" The Mill Rats responded by signing two players, including Darren Duncan. Anderson returned to the court in a rematch with the Miracles on February 1, notching 15 points and 7 assists. In the remainder of the regular season, he recorded 2 double-doubles and had three games in which he scored 20 or more points.

He hoped to carry his team to the championship with new head coach Rob Spon. Spon commented, \"I've finally got my wish to coach [Anderson] come true. Instead of watching him torch me, I get to help him unleash his potential on other teams.\" In his season debut on November 1, 2013, Anderson scored 23 points in a road win over the Halifax Rainmen.

He finished the season as the league's all-time leading scorer, with 2,121 points. Anderson later reflected on the year, saying, \"I have never been on a team that was so together from the coach all the way down to the last guy ... it was a family for real.\"\nAnderson returned to the Mill Rats for the 2014–15 season on September 17, 2014. Ian McCarthy described him as the team's \"franchise player since we have been in existence.\" The Mill Rats also replaced Spon with head coach Julian King. In his season opener, Anderson scored 21 points and recorded seven assists to push Saint John past the Miracles on November 1, 2014. In his next game vs. the Storm on November 6, he notched 19 points and 10 rebounds and followed up with another double-double against the same team, with 14 points and 14 assists. On November 21, 2014, Anderson dropped 31 points on the A's and topped that performance with 34 points against the Storm in his following appearance. However, the two contests resulted in defeats.

Anderson had 31 points and seven assists in his next game vs. the Rainmen. He scored 30 or more points in just one of the remaining 16 regular season games, and the Mill Rats exited the playoffs after losing in the first round to the Storm, 2–3, in the best-of-five series.\nOn November 19, 2015, Anderson re-signed with the Mill Rats along with fellow former NBL Canada MVP, Gabe Freeman. He reunited with Rob Spon, who spent the previous season with the Rochester Razorsharks. Spon said, \"Anthony and Gabe are two of the best players I have coached. To have them together on the same team is going to be something special to see. Both of them are winners and leaders and they will make my job that much easier.\" Anderson debuted with a double-double, scoring 24 points and adding 10 assists in a victory over the Storm on December 26, 2015.

He recorded career-highs of 51 points and nine three-pointers in a 147–102 win over the Orangeville A's on February 18, breaking the Mill Rats' single-game records in both categories. Two days after his performance, he was named the league's Player of the Week.\nOn October 23, 2017, Anderson signed with the Moncton Magic.\nPersonal life.\nAnthony is the older brother of Antonio Anderson, who is currently the head coach for the boys basketball team at Lynn English High School. Antonio played college basketball with the Memphis Tigers under head coach John Calipari and was most notably named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year in 2009. He has experience playing professional basketball in the NBA Development League and outside North America. He also played alongside Anthony with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2012. The National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, signed him to multiple 10-day contracts in February 2010. The two brothers' uncle, Marvin Avery, said, \"There's some in our family that have been in trouble, but we always had Antonio and his brother [Anthony] playing basketball or traveling somewhere to play basketball at all times.\" When Anthony began playing at UMass, his younger brother became frustrated with basketball and wanted to play American football instead. However, Anthony and his uncles convinced him to continue playing basketball.\nIn the summer, Anthony often holds basketball camps and runs a pro–am league. His longtime girlfriend and wife is Krista Morris, who he met after one of his games. Morris came in contact with Anderson because her friend was dating an assistant coach on the Mill Rats. The two later bought a home for themselves. Anderson has a son, Jacari, who was born in mid-2015.\nIn 2023, Anderson was named the \"Greatest Player in NBL Canada History\" voted by the coaches, GMs, and owners of the league's 10-year history."

        "title": "2015 Preakness Stakes",
        "text": "The 2015 Preakness Stakes, (run as the Xpressbet.com Preakness Stakes due to sponsorship), was the 140th running of the Preakness Stakes, promoted as the \"middle jewel\" of thoroughbred horse racing's traditional Triple Crown, held two weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes. The race was held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 16, 2015, and was televised on NBC. \nThe event carried a $1,500,000 purse. The winner was American Pharoah, who won by seven lengths with jockey Victor Espinoza aboard. The win by American Pharoah set up an attempt for the Triple Crown for the second time in two years. The Maryland Jockey Club reported a track record total attendance of 131,680, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2015.\nPre-race.\nTrainer Bob Baffert confirmed on May 3 that the 2015 Kentucky Derby winner American Pharoah came out of the Derby in good health and would be running the Preakness Stakes. The connections of the other top three finishers, Firing Line and Dortmund, announced they would challenge in the event. \nTwo contenders that did not appear in the Kentucky Derby were announced as probable entrants in late April: Grade III Lexington Stakes winner Divining Rod (owned by Lael Stable, trained by Arnaud Delacour, bred by Mr. and Mrs. Roy Jackson, ridden by jockey Julien Leparoux) and Listed Stakes Federico Tesio Stakes winner at Pimlico Bodhisattva (owned and trained by Jose Corrales, ridden by jockey Trevor McCarthy).\nA week prior to the Preakness, other contenders were announced. These included fifth-placed Kentucky Derby competitor Danzig Moon and the also-eligible Tale of Verve who did not start in the Derby.\nThe draw for the race was held on May 13 and eight horses were entered. This was the smallest field in 15 years. American Pharoah drew the pole position and was installed as the morning line favorite. All entries carried 126 pounds.\nRace description.\nImmediately prior to post time, the skies opened up with a heavy downpour and thunder, changing the track conditions. The infield and grandstands were evacuated shortly before post time due to concerns about spectators being struck by lightning. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983. American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously won under such conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes on a sloppy track. He had the lead within the first quarter-mile and was challenged by Mr. Z early on, but held the lead on the inside throughout the race. He was challenged by Dortmund and then Divining Rod, but American Pharoah broke from the pack in the homestretch and won by seven lengths, as Tale of Verve made a strong rally to overtake Divining Rod to place. Firing Line slipped badly at the start and was eased in the stretch. Baffert commented on American Pharoah's race, \"when I saw those ears go up [on the backside of the track], I thought, ‘Oh, yeah. Oh yeah.’” The win by American Pharoah set up an attempt for the Triple Crown for the second time in two years.\nDue to weather conditions, the winning time of 1:58.46 was the slowest time since Hill Prince won in 1950 with a time of 1:59.20, and well off the record, set by Secretariat in 1973, of 1:53.00. The intensity of the rain was described in a post-race interview by Firing Line's rider, Gary Stevens, who explained that he weighed in at 120 pounds with equipment prior to the race, but was 135 pounds afterwards—without his helmet—and needed to empty water out of his riding boots following his weigh-out. Stevens added that the conditions made little difference to the outcome, however, saying \"it would take a super horse to beat what might be a super horse in American Pharoah.\" \nThe city of Baltimore had been in a state of tension due to the death of Freddie Gray and surrounding civil disorder, and the Preakness was the state's major one-day sporting event, viewed as critical in the healing process for the city. Concerns existed because the track was only three miles from the Mondawmin Mall, where there had been riots. Pimlico's former vice-president for communications, Mike Gathagan, stated to ESPN, \"I think sports, like ... the Preakness can help bring back normalcy...It could help start the healing process...\" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, in awarding the traditional Woodlawn Vase replica to American Pharoah's owner, Ahmed Zayat, stated, \"It's a great day for Baltimore, a great day for Maryland.\" Comparing the 2015 Preakness to the post-9/11 home run of Mike Piazza, ESPN's Bob Ehalt wrote, \"for that reason alone, this could be the biggest and most important Preakness ever.\"\nPayout.\nThe 140th Preakness payout schedule"

        "text": "Team Coast was an American esports organization and \"League of Legends\" website. It was originally formed under the name Good Game University on January 4, 2013, by the former roster of Team Dynamic following their departure from the parent organization. They named themselves Good Game University before changing their name to Team Coast on June 1, 2013. Their first offline tournament was the League of Legends Season 3 North American qualifiers where they qualified for a spot in the Season 3 League of Legends Championship Series (LCS).\n\"League of Legends\".\n2013.\nOn January 4, Good Game University was founded by the former roster of Team Dynamic following their departure from the parent multi-gaming organization. ZionSpartan, NintendudeX, DontMashMe, Shiphtur, I am Anjo, and Pixel joined the team.\nTeam Dynamic, composed of ZionSpartan, NintendudeX, DontMashMe, Shiphtur, I am Anjo, and Pixel, form Good Game University after leaving their parent organization. In January 2013, Good Game University competed in the North American LCS Qualifier. In the group stage, Good Game University beat Epik Gamer and Team TowerDiveTV, while dropping one game to Team FeaR. By winning those two games, GGU advanced to day two of the event where they would defeat Dirtnap Gaming and secure their spot in the Spring Split of the NA LCS. On January 24, Diamond joined. February 4, Fat joined. February 11, Luthman joined. February 13, BloodWater joined. I am Anjo become a sub. February 27, Jintae joins.\nShiphtur, GGU's mid lane player, was unable to play in the Spring LCS due to Visa issues. With substitute player Jintae, GGU opened the season poorly, going 2–12 with a seven-game losing streak. However, with the acquisition of Daydreamin, GGU turned their season around and finished sixth at 11–17 in the Spring Split, securing their spot in the NA LCS Spring Playoffs. In the quarterfinals of the playoffs, GGU defeated Dignitas 2–1, advancing them to the semifinals, where they beat Team Curse 2–1. With those two victories under their belt, GGU advanced to the finals, where they faced off against Team SoloMid (TSM). Although TSM won 3–2, Good Game University secured their spot in the NA LCS Summer Season.\nOn April 3, BloodWater leaves. After finishing the spring split at second place in the playoffs, the team renamed to Team Coast, their new sponsor. Additionally, ex-Curse Gaming support player Elementz became their coach. In early August Shiphtur's visa issues were resolved when he was granted a P visa, and he was able to play mid for Team Coast in the summer LCS season, replacing Jintae.\nTeam Coast began the season tied for second during Week One, but thanks to a seven-game losing streak at the end of the split, Coast had to settle for seventh with a record of 9–19. This meant they would be sent to relegation matches in December to win back their spot into the league for the Season 4 Spring Promotion. On June 1, Good Game University became Team Coast. Elementz joined as a coach. On June 18, Raìna joins. On June 25, CyberPowerPC became a sponsor of the team. July 2, Corsair sponsors Team Coast. August 19, LoL-Class sponsors Team Coast. October 28, DontMashMe leaves. November 26, WizFujiiN joins. December 12, coach Elementz leaves.\nIn the offseason, Team Coast was invited to some amateur scene events, winning ggLA Challenger Arena 5 and then earning a spot onto the new competitive league, North American Challenger League (NACL). During the first week of the NACL, on October 8, 2013, DontMashMe announced that he had stepped down from his starter AD position. On November 26, WizFujiiN joined as the new starting AD.\nIn December, Coast revealed that they would compete with challenger team The Walking Zed for a spot in the Season 4 Spring Split North American LCS at the Spring Promotion tournament. There, Coast would prevail 3-2 and receive a spot in their third LCS split, the Season 4 Spring Split.\n2014.\nOn January 5, Alex \"Zaroxy\" Penn joined as a coach/analyst. January 25, FEENIX sponsored Team Coast, while Corsair dropped their sponsorship. April 19, 6th place at2014 NA LCS Spring Playoffs May 2, Shiphtur and ZionSpartan leave. May 13, Santorin joins Team Coast as the starting jungler while NintendudeX moves to the sub position. June 9, new roster is announced, Dontmashme and Sheep join while Daydreamin and WizFujiiN moves to sub. Chaox joins as a coach. Team Coast finished sixth at the 2014 NA LCS Spring Playoffs after losing 2–0 to CLG and then 2–1 to Team Dignitas. The team was then relegated to the Riot League Championship Series/North America/2014 Season/Summer Promotion|2014 Summer Promotion Tournament, along with XDG Gaming and Evil Geniuses. Despite being favorited to win its series against , having the best spring season record of the three teams facing relegation, and facing arguably the weakest of the three competing challenger teams, Coast lost 1-3 and with it lost its place in the LCS. Mid laner Shiphtur and top laner ZionSpartan quickly departed the team for warmer waters with Team Dignitas, while jungler NintendudeX stepped down to a substitute position.\nIn June, Coast announced a new starting roster, consisting mainly of experienced free agents. AD carry Dontmashme rejoined the team with renewed LCS aspirations, replacing WizFujiiN. Their new support player Sheep, had some LCS experience with XDG Gaming, along with mid laner Goldenglue with Team Dignitas and top laner Rhux with Team Curse. The only player without LCS experience, jungler Santorin, had been a substitute for top-ranked challenger team Cloud9 Eclipse in Europe. Lastly, Coast hired on Chaox, Season 2 star of Team SoloMid, as a coach.\nAs a recently relegated team, Coast was entered to compete in the 2014 NA Challenger Series (NACS). With series against Team Green Forest, Curse Academy, and Team LoLPro, Coast took first place with an overall 6–1 record. In July, in the 2014 Summer NACS, Coast again took first with series wins against Denial eSports, Team 8, and Curse Academy, with an undefeated 6–0 sweep. With two NACS titles at their back, Coast entered the August playoffs with high hopes and a first round bye, only to be swept in the semifinals by Team 8. Without letting their negative momentum continue, Coast defeated Team LoLPro in the third place match and took home US$8,000.\nJuly 22, Chaox steps down as the team's Coach. August 30, Rhux and goldenglue were moved to sub positions. September 3, Miracle and Ringer joins. September 11, Sheep leaves Team Coast. September 27, LOD and Cris join. September 30, wewillfailer joined as Coach. October 3, Elementz comes back as Coach. October 27, Impaler and Jesiz join, while LOD and Santorin leave.\n2015.\nOn February 17, Mancloud joins as starting Mid laner, while Jesiz moved to sub. March 13, Sheep and Impaler left, and KonKwon joined. WelcomeToHeaven moved to starting jungler. May 2, mancloud left the team. Coast finished the 2015 Spring LCS in last place. The Daily Dot reported that a source close to the team revealed the team would disband rather than be relegated to the Challenger Series. However the team immediately responded on their Twitter account that this was not true.\nIn November, it was announced that Team Coast's LCS spot had been sold to a new esports organization called NRG Esports."

Cuba ran in the final under protest and finished in second place. The disqualification was upheld and their result was removed. Later that was corrected and Cuba was reinstated as the silver medalists.\nThe final race started with the tall Venezuelan Alberth Bravo taking a commanding lead, making up the stagger on the diminutive Renny Quow from Trinidad and Tobago to his outside. Reality set in on the home stretch, Quow holding form on a more evenly paced race while Bravo tied up. TTO passed first while Bravo ended up passing last to a flat footed José Meléndez. Michael Mathieu sped through the turn to put Bahamas in the lead at the break. Jarrin Solomon and Adrian Chacón had TTO and Cuba fall in behind, putting a gap on USA leading the rest of the field. As they battled on the final straightaway, James Harris bridged the gap to make it a four team breakaway at the handoff. With Bahamas (Alonzo Russell) and Cuba (Osmaidel Pellicier) battling for the lead, Marcus Chambers fell off the back for USA on the backstretch while hurdler Emanuel Mayers for TTO tied up at the finish, allowing USA to hand off third well behind the leaders. Bahamas had a two-metre lead at the handoff, which Jeffery Gibson quickly extended to five through the turn. Another five metres back Machel Cedenio used his inside position to get the jump on American hurdler Kerron Clement. Down the backstretch and through the final turn, Cuba's Yoandys Lescay slowly whittled down Gibson's lead. By the head of the stretch it was down to a metre, with Cedenio and Clement 8 metres back. Coming off the turn Lescay moved into lane 2 and eased past Gibson, whose strides noticeably shortened. Behind them, Cedenio came off the turn wide into lane 2, with Clement looking to take advantage accelerating on his inside. Instead, Cedenio exploded into a different gear, sprinting while the rest of the runners were trying to maintain their stride. In 60 metres he made up the gap on Lescay, passing him 8 metres before the finish for the Trinidad and Tobago win. Clement followed Cedenio, passing the struggling Gibson for bronze but still four metres behind Lescay.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Pan American Games records were as follows:\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) ranked in the world's top 16 was able to enter one team.\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds."

        "text": "The 2016 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by PennGrade Motor Oil for sponsorship reasons) took place on Sunday, May 29, 2016, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It was the premier event of the 2016 Verizon IndyCar Series season. In a shocking finish, 24 year-old rookie Alexander Rossi of Andretti Herta Autosport w/ Curb-Agajanian won the race on fuel mileage over Carlos Muñoz and Josef Newgarden. Two-time winner Juan Pablo Montoya entered the race as the defending champion.\nOver the final ten laps, most of the leaders were cycling through pit stops, as no one was expected to make it to the finish without pitting for fuel. Most drivers had not pitted since the previous caution that ended on lap 166. Alexander Rossi's team took a huge gamble and coached the driver into saving fuel. As the other leaders made their stops, Rossi inherited the lead on lap 197. He slowed down to save fuel, but on the final lap Carlos Muñoz began charging to catch up. Coming out of turn four on the final lap, Rossi pulled to the inside and literally coasted across the finish line, to take the checkered flag. Muñoz finished 4.4975 seconds behind, his second runner-up finish at Indy (2013, 2016). Rossi was out of fuel, and came to a stop during his cool down lap. A tow truck brought him in, believed to be the first time in Indy history the race winner was towed back to victory lane. \nThe 2016 race marked a milestone as the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500. The race came five years after the event's Centennial Era, a three-year long commemoration which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening of the circuit (1909), and the 100th anniversary of the first Indy 500 (1911). The 2016 running was the ninety-ninth scheduled 500-mile race of the canon, as the 1916 race was scheduled as a 300-mile race. It also commemorated the bicentennial of Indiana statehood.\nThe month of May activities at the Speedway opened May 14 with the third annual Grand Prix of Indianapolis. Indianapolis 500 practice began on Monday, May 16. Time trials were held on May 21–22, with James Hinchcliffe winning the pole position. Carb Day, the traditional final practice session, and the annual Pit Stop Challenge, was held May 27. Considerable pre-race hype surrounded the milestone event, and for the first time the race was announced as a complete sellout (both grandstand tickets and infield). Due to the sellout, the local television blackout of the ABC broadcast was lifted for the first time ever.\nRace background.\nGoing into the race, Simon Pagenaud of Team Penske had mostly dominated the first five races of the 2016 IndyCar season. He finished second in the first two events (St. Petersburg and Phoenix), and won the next three races (Long Beach, Alabama, and the Grand Prix of Indianapolis) to take a sizable lead in the championship points standings.\nThe most discussed issues in the weeks leading up the race involved the ongoing development of aero kit regulations, and the competitive balance between the two engine manufacturers (Chevrolet and Honda). After three major crashes in 2015, in which cars flipped over and became airborne, series officials attempted to address the situation by adding \"dome skids\" - aerodynamic devices affixed to the undertrays of the cars, designed to keep the cars on the ground during a crash. This rule change was met with some resistance, particularly from the Honda teams, after testing revealed them to be unsettling to the cars' handling. After practice opened, however, the issues appeared to have been mostly resolved. None of the crashes that occurred during practice or qualifying saw the respective cars flip over. With respect to the engine competition, Chevrolet entered the month having swept all five race wins and all five race pole positions. In addition, Chevrolet had noticeably outperformed Honda in the 2015 race, sweeping the top five spots in qualifying, as well as the top four positions on race day. After practice opened, however, Honda teams led the speed chart on three of the four days (one day was rained out), and also secured the pole position - Honda's first Indy 500 pole since 2011.\nEarly in the month of May, Speedway officials announced that the grandstand seating for the race had sold out. It marked the first sell-out since before 2003.\nOn May 25, Speedway officials announced that the race had reached a total sellout with all general admission tickets sold. In addition, it was announced that for the first time since 1950, the race would not be blacked out for the local audience.\nThis race would turn out to be the final race of Alex Tagliani's career. For 2017 and onwards, Tagliani would shift his focus to mainly NASCAR. This would also be the final race for Townsend Bell after 13 seasons in IndyCar. After this race, Bell would shift his focus to sports cars racing in the IMSA SportsCar Championship from 2017 onwards. \nEntry list.\n Winner \n Rookie\nSponsorship.\nFor the first time in race history, the Indianapolis 500 had a presenting sponsor: the PennGrade brand of the Lebanon, Indiana-based D-A Lubricant company. D-A Lubricant has had a long history of involvement in the Indianapolis 500, having historically sponsored teams at the race in the late-1950s, and being a current associate sponsor of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. Although terms of the deal were not officially announced, the \"Indianapolis Star\" reported via sources that it is a three-year deal valued around $5 million.\nTesting and rookie orientation.\nManufacturer's test – Tuesday, April 5.\nFour Chevrolet teams and one Honda team conducted a private test at the Speedway on Tuesday, April 5. The test was primarily to evaluate dome skids, a titanium safety device affixed to the underside of the chassis intended to reduce the chance of cars becoming airborne in a crash. Honda teams had already tested the dome skids once at Fontana. A new rear wing flap was also added being tested.\nMarco Andretti was the lone Honda participant on Tuesday. Chevrolet participants included Sébastien Bourdais, Ed Carpenter, Hélio Castroneves, Scott Dixon and Juan Pablo Montoya. Temperatures were cool, and no incidents were reported.\nRookie Orientation and Refresher Tests – Monday, May 16.\nRookie orientation and veteran refresher tests were held on the first day of practice from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. The 40-lap rookie test consisted of three phases demonstrating car control, placement, and a consistent driving pattern. Phase one consists of 10 laps over , phase two consists of 15 laps at , and phase three requires 15 laps at over . Five rookies took part in the session. Alexander Rossi, Max Chilton, and Spencer Pigot passed all three phases. Matthew Brabham and Stefan Wilson passed the first two phases, and were permitted to pass the third phase during any open practice session. Both successfully completed the final phase in the full-field session later that day.\nTime trials.\nFirst Day — Saturday, May 21.\nMorning rain delayed the start of practice until 12:30 p.m. Six minutes into the practice session, Max Chilton spun in turn two and crashed into the outside wall. He was not seriously injured. Alexander Rossi set the fastest lap of the practice session at . Officials announced that time trials would be extended to 7 p.m., to account for lost track time due to the moisture and weepers. The top nine qualifiers for the day would be locked in, and advance to the Top Nine Shootout on Sunday. The drivers for positions 10-33 would also be determined, but the actual starting positions will not set until Sunday.\nQualifying began at 2:15 p.m. Tony Kanaan was the first driver to complete an attempt. The early qualifiers were led by Josef Newgarden (), who tentatively took the top spot of the qualifying chart. Rising track temperatures, and wind gusts in turn one, were making qualifying runs challenging for drivers. About an hour later, at 3:40 p.m., Townsend Bell upped the speed to , and took over the top spot.\nAt 4:24 p.m., Pippa Mann was on her qualifying run, when a rear wing end fence failed. The car broke into a spin in turn two, scrubbed off speed, and tagged the outside wall twice. It came to rest against the inside wall. The car suffered moderate damage, and Mann was not injured. The track stood mostly quiet over the next hour, as teams awaited better track conditions, and waited to see who would make the first move to re-qualify.\nAt 5:52 p.m., Mikhail Aleshin was the first car to get in line to re-qualify, and improved on his earlier speed. Within moments, teams up and down the pit lane began scrambling to get into the qualifying line. Teams could elect to get into one of two lines. The normal qualifying allowed drivers an opportunity to re-qualify, but if they did not improve, they could revert to the earlier speed. The \"fast track\" line allowed drivers to move directly to the front of the queue, but at the expense of withdrawing their earlier speed. Hélio Castroneves set the tone for the final hour, moving to position 1 with a speed of . Not to be upstaged, James Hinchcliffe went even faster (). In the final minutes, Marco Andretti made a last-ditch effort to make the Fast Nine. With seven minutes left, Andretti bumped out his teammate Ryan Hunter-Reay. Hunter-Reay answered, putting himself second, and bumping Andretti out of the Fast Nine. With just seconds left before the final gun, Mikhail Aleshin got out onto the track for one more run. Aleshin bumped his way into the top nine as time expired. All top nine qualifiers were over the barrier.\nSecond Day — Sunday, May 22.\nPole Day qualification saw warmer temperatures than the previous day's trials with roughly the same amount of wind, resulting in lower speeds and an even slicker track. Qualifications began with the determining of positions 10 through 33. Early in the session, Alex Tagliani lost control of his car, hit the outside wall, then slid back across the track and tapped the pit lane attenuator with the nose of his car. Tagliani was uninjured, but the crash forced him to start in last place. Later in the session, a minor incident occurred where a trash bag blew onto the course in the middle of Juan Pablo Montoya's run. Montoya ran over the trash bag, causing a massive loss in downforce for the remainder of the run. IndyCar officials allowed Montoya to retry his run due to the circumstances. The 10-33 position session was topped by Schmidt Peterson Motorsports Oriol Servià with a speed of . Marco Andretti, who was one of the fastest cars during the week, was hampered in his run due a broken fifth gear, relegating him to a 14th place start.\nFast Nine qualifying began shortly after the final run from the first group. Josef Newgarden held the fastest time for much of the session with a speed of . However, his time was beat at the last moment by the final qualifier of the day, James Hinchcliffe, who went just fast enough to best Newgarden with a speed of . Hinchcliffe's pole came one year after his near fatal accident during practice for the previous years running of the race. The pole also marked Schmidt Peterson Motorsports first pole position at Indianapolis since Alex Tagliani won pole in 2011.\nPost-qualifying practice.\nMonday, May 23.\nPost-qualifying practice was scheduled on Monday, May 23. The session was scheduled only until 4:00 p.m. to allow practice for Indy Lights later in the day. The teams converted their cars back to race setups and boost was reduced back to race day levels. All 33 cars appeared on track, mainly participating in drafting and race simulations. One incident occurred during the day just after 3:10 p.m., when fire erupted from the left rear on the car of Jack Hawksworth. Hawksworth emerged from the car quickly. Despite the shortened session, more laps were turned during the day than any other practice session prior, with a total of 2886 laps. Chevrolet cars took the first four spots in the speed charts for the day, with Josef Newgarden running the fastest lap at .\nCarb Day.\nPractice — Friday, May 27.\nCarb day practice was scheduled Friday, May 27. Practice was only scheduled for 70 minutes to allow for other events later in the day. The day also turned out to be the warmest practice session of the month. One incident occurred during the day when Pippa Mann slapped the wall coming off of turn four early in the session. Tony Kanaan set the fastest time of the day at . \nRace.\nFirst half.\nRaceday featured partly cloudy skies and temperatures in the low range. Hélio Castroneves had a small issue getting his car started, but quickly resumed his place on the grid. During the first parade lap, smoke began to come from underneath the car of Buddy Lazier, stemming from what was later reported to be a stuck throttle. Lazier would not return to the race until roughly a quarter of the way through.\nStart.\nPole starter James Hinchcliffe led the field into the first turn, but was passed on the backstretch by Ryan Hunter-Reay, who led the first lap of the race. From here, the first quarter of the race became a three-way battle for the lead between Hunter-Reay, Hinchcliffe, and Josef Newgarden. The first round of pit stops occurred during this time, which served to spread out the field and separate the leaders from the rest of the pack. They also allowed for Townsend Bell to join in on the battle for the lead. On lap 47, the first caution of the day flew for debris on the backstretch. During the ensuing pit stops, an incident occurred when Will Power pushed Tony Kanaan against the pit lane wall while exiting his own pit stall. Power was penalized for the incident (Unsafe Pit Exit Release) and sent to the rear of the field.\nSecond quarter.\nGreen flag racing resumed on lap 54 with Ryan Hunter-Reay in the lead. The battle between him and James Hinchcliffe resumed with the two swapping the lead regularly. The battle was interrupted on lap 64 when defending champion Juan Pablo Montoya lost control of his car in turn two and hit the outside wall. This marked the first time that Montoya failed to finish an Indy 500. Pit stops again occurred during this yellow. A second pit lane incident occurred when Simon Pagenaud, who had been running well up in the field, bumped into the car of Mikhail Aleshin while leaving his pit box. Pagenaud, just as his teammate Will Power, was sent to the back of the field for the incident (Unsafe Pit Exit Release). During the pit stop sequence, Will Power elected to stay out, giving him the lead.\nThe race was attempted to be resumed on lap 71, but reports of moisture briefly delayed the restart. The race went back green on lap 74, where Will Power was quickly shuffled back by James Hinchcliffe and Ryan Hunter-Reay, who once again resumed their duel for the lead. At roughly lap 90, Hélio Castroneves joined the leading group and inherited the lead for the first time on lap 92. The third caution of the day came out just laps later on lap 94, when Sage Karam went wide while trying to pass Townsend Bell and slapped the wall in turn one. Karam's car slid against the wall all the way to the backstretch. Pit stops occurred during the yellow with no major incidents. Bryan Clauson stayed out to lead three laps during this yellow before making his own stop, promoting Castroneves back into the lead. Also during this yellow, Simon Pagenaud began to report that the engine in his car had started to misfire, effectively ending his chances of winning the race.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nThe green flag came out again on lap 104. Hélio Castroneves led for the opening few laps after the restart, but soon fell behind Ryan Hunter-Reay, Townsend Bell, and Tony Kanaan. These three would fight for the lead for the next several laps, swapping positions regularly. On lap 115, the 4th caution period of the race occurred when the rear suspension on the car of Mikhail Aleshin broke, sending him spinning into the turn one wall. Conor Daly was also collected in the incident after spinning in an attempt to avoid Aleshin's car. Daly retired from the race due to the incident, while Aleshin would eventually return after many laps of repair.\nYellow flag pit stops during this caution period brought one of the most pivotal moments of the race. As cars exited the pits, previous race leader Townsend Bell attempting to gain position contacted with Hélio Castroneves, sending Bell into a spin that collected Ryan Hunter-Reay. Bell and Hunter-Reay would both fall off the lead lap due to the incident, while Castroneves was not greatly affected. During these pit stops, Alex Tagliani and Alexander Rossi elected not to pit, putting them off sequence from the rest of the field.\nRacing resumed on lap 121 with Alex Tagliani in the lead. Alex Tagliani matched a record set by Tom Sneva in the 1980 race and became the second driver in Indy 500 history to start last and lead laps during the race.\nThe battle for the lead became a battle between Tagliani and Alexander Rossi for roughly 15 laps, before both drivers had to come in for their own pit stops. This handed the battle for the lead back to Hélio Castroneves and Tony Kanaan. On lap 149, Castroneves and Kanaan appeared to be leading what would be another round of green flag pit stops. However, just as both reached their pit boxes, the fifth caution of the day occurred when a tire from Buddy Lazier's car came off the car and onto the race surface in turn two. Lazier would retire from the race due to damage caused from trying to drive with only three wheels. Yellow flag pit stops would once again occur, cycling Castroneves and Kanaan back to the front of the field. Several cars would be sent to the rear of the field during this caution for entering a closed pit lane in order to have emergency fuel service.\nFourth quarter.\nRacing resumed on lap 158 with Hélio Castroneves in the lead, but Tony Kanaan took the lead almost immediately. A four-way battle for the lead ensued as Castroneves and Kaanan were joined by Josef Newgarden and James Hinchcliffe. On lap 161, Castroneves's chances of winning were dashed when J. R. Hildebrand clipped the left rear bumper pod on Castroneves's car, forcing him to the pit to make repairs. Castroneves caught a small break, though, when the sixth and final caution of the race flew just two laps later after Takuma Sato hit the outside wall at the exit of turn four. Believing all cars would need to stop again, most drivers made yellow flag pit stops.\nThe green flag flew once again on lap 167. The battle for the lead became a three way duel between Tony Kanaan, Josef Newgarden, and Carlos Muñoz. J. R. Hildebrand also ran in the lead group, but was off sequence in pit stop strategy and came in much earlier than anyone else.\nFinish.\nWith 10 laps to go, it became apparent that the leaders would need a splash of fuel to get the cars to the end of the race. Of the leading group, Tony Kanaan would be the first to pit, followed by Josef Newgarden a few laps later, and finally Carlos Muñoz with five laps to go. It appeared the winner would be the driver with the best pit stop.\nWhen Muñoz made his stop, the lead of the race passed to Alexander Rossi, who had been 10th at the time of the previous restart. With the guidance of Bryan Herta, Rossi attempted to gamble on fuel and finish the race without another pit stop. With two laps to go, Rossi began to slow considerably in order to bring the car to the finish. As the white flag fell, Rossi held a lead of over 20 seconds. Despite running a final lap at less than and coasting from turn 4 to the finish line, Rossi was able to hang on to win by roughly 4.5 seconds over his teammate Carlos Muñoz. Rossi was the first rookie to win the Indianapolis 500 since 2001 when Hélio Castroneves took victory in his first attempt. Rossi would eventually run out of fuel on the cool-down lap, requiring his car to be towed into Victory Lane.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from Time Trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe Indianapolis 500 was broadcast live in the United States on ABC and streaming on WatchESPN and the ESPN app, called by Allen Bestwick, Scott Goodyear and Eddie Cheever. The broadcast utilized 100 television cameras, including 36 on-board cameras on twelve cars. Pre-race coverage began race morning with \"SportsCenter on the Road\" live at the Speedway with hosts Matt Barrie, Sara Walsh, Marty Smith and Ryan McGee.\nOn May 25, Speedway officials announced that all grandstand and general admission tickets had sold out. As a result, the local television blackout of the ABC network telecast was lifted for the first time since the race went to live \"flag-to-flag\" coverage in 1986. For Indianapolis viewers, it was the first time since 1950 that they were able to watch the race live on local television (the 1949 and 1950 races were broadcast locally on WFBM-TV, but Speedway officials barred live television coverage after 1950 out of fear that such broadcasts would cut into live attendance).\nThe race was also aired in Spanish through ABC's SAP channel in the United States and Puerto Rico and on ESPN in all of Latin America (except for Brazil), called by Andrés Agulla and Alex Pombo.\nThe race was also aired in Portuguese through the Band and BandSports channels in Brazil, called by Téo José and former IndyCar driver Felipe Giaffone.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live by the IMS Radio Network, part of the Advanced Auto Parts IndyCar Radio Network. Paul Page announced his retirement from the crew, and handed over play-by-play duties to the new \"Voice of the 500\" Mark Jaynes. Page, and fellow former chief announcers Bob Jenkins, and Mike King, took part in the pre-race coverage. Page called the pace laps and the start of the race, then handed the call over to Jaynes for the completion of the first lap. Jenkins recorded commentary for the pre-race, then spent the day at his normal role on the public address announcing team. Page, as well as Mike King, visited the booth during the race and during the post-race for guest commentary. The pre-race coverage was extended from one hour to two hours, with the first hour celebrating the 100th running with recaps and highlights of past races.\nWith Jaynes moving from his long-time position in turn three (2000-2015) to the Pagoda booth, the announcing crew shuffled slightly from previous years. Jake Query, previously a pit reporter, and then the turn two reporter, took over the turn three position. Nick Yeoman, also previously a pit reporter, took over the turn two location. Historian Donald Davidson celebrated his 52nd year as a part of the broadcast, and Jerry Baker his 43rd. This was Baker's 29th year reporting from turn one, which is believed to be the second-longest tenure of any reporter in one of the turns - second only to Jim Shelton in turn four (32 years). Newcomer Rob Howden joined the crew in the pits. Dave Wilson returned to the crew, this time monitoring the race coverage and impressions on social media. No reporters were specifically assigned to the garage area and/or track medical center, but pit reporter Rob Howden made one roving report at each location.\nDuring the broadcast, the commercial out-cues were recited by Jaynes, and the historical chief announcers (like 2009, 2011-2013). During commercial breaks, the classic Stark &amp; Wetzel \"whistle\" jingle was also used, as well as a classic Stark &amp; Wetzel commercial, reflecting the famous former sponsor of the network from the 1950s and 1960s. Sponsor guests included Mark Reuss (GM), Dale Herrigle (Firestone), James Verrier (BorgWarner), and Speedway president Doug Boles.\n1070 The Fan broadcast nightly beginning May 2 with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\", followed by Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\"."

The number of divisions changed frequently in the following years, as did the name of the league, changing to Verbandsliga for a time. From 1991 it operated under name of Regionalliga again with seven divisions, one in the North and two each in the West, Central and Bavaria.

He was described as having been a good judge of fly balls, having a good arm, and being a faster runner than his gait would indicate.\nHe was born in Peru, Illinois.\n1920s.\nHe began his career with the Rock Island Islanders, hitting .358 with a .624 slugging percentage, 20 home runs, 39 doubles and 10 triples to lead the Mississippi Valley League in home runs, slugging percentage and total bases (279). He also went 4-3 in 12 games as a pitcher that year. With the Terrell Terrors in 1925, Keyes hit .325 with 28 home runs, 15 triples and 30 doubles, while slugging .634. He also went hitless in a game with the Waco Cubs, bringing his season batting average to .322 and his slugging mark to .629. He led the Texas Association in home runs. In 1926, he played for Waco Cubs and Temple Surgeons and in 1927, he played for the Asheville Tourists. His statistical details are unknown for those years. In 1928, back with the Tourists, he hit .330 with a .535 slugging percentage, 15 home runs, 19 triples and 30 doubles in 147 games and was named to the South Atlantic League All-Star team. Keyes split 1929 between Asheville (110 games) and the Minneapolis Millers (59 games) and hit a combined .352 with 25 home runs, 229 hits, 42 doubles, 18 triples, a .587 slugging percentage and 382 total bases in 169 games. Despite spending more than a third of his season elsewhere, he still led the South Atlantic League in batting average and slugging percentage.\n1930s.\nHe dominated minor league baseball during the early part of the 1930s.\nJoining the Des Moines Demons in 1930, he hit .340 with 190 hits, 35 home runs, 140 RBI, 18 triples, a .640 slugging percentage and 358 total bases. He led the Western League in home runs, RBI, slugging percentage and total bases and broke the league home run of 32, held by both Ping Bodie and Dutch Wetzel. He also played in the first night game in professional history that year, which was played against the Wichita Aviators in Des Moines on May 2. He made the All-Star team that year. And 1931 was even better. In 132 games with Des Moines, he hit .369 with 38 home runs, 160 RBI, 36 doubles, 24 triples, 203 hits, a .729 slugging percentage and 401 total bases. He won the Western League Triple Crown—leading the league in home runs, RBI and batting average—and also paced the loop in hits, slugging and total bases. He was again an All-Star and broke his own league record for home runs. His 160 RBI set an unbroken league record. He hit another home run in nine games with the Millers that year to bring his season total to 39. He moved to the Nashville Volunteers in 1932 and hit .341 with a .604 slugging mark, 210 hits, 35 home runs, 35 doubles, 11 triples and 372 total bases in 155 games. He tied Elliot Bigelow for the Southern Association league lead in games played and was the sole leader in home runs and total bases.\nHis career decline began in 1933. He hit .321 with a .532 slugging percentage and 11 home runs in 87 games for Nashville, but batted only .191 with two home runs in 33 games for the Houston Buffaloes to bring his season totals to .288 with a .477 slugging percentage and 13 home runs in 120 games. In 1934, he joined the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, who whom he hit .310 with 19 home runs, 48 doubles, 211 hits and 334 total bases in 182 games. The 36-year-old returned to Oakland for 1936 and hit .293 with 17 home runs and 38 doubles in 137 games. Returning to Des Moines for 1937, he hit .287 with 20 home runs in 124 games. He suited up for the San Antonio Missions in 1938 and batted .291 with 16 home runs and 12 triples in 132 games. With the Augusta Tigers in 1938, he hit .320 with seven home runs in 134 games; he followed that with a .333 batting average and .535 slugging mark in 82 matches split between the Macon Peaches and Portsmouth Cubs in 1939.\n1940s and career summary.\nKeyes last played for the Spartanburg Spartans in 1940, batting .281 with no home runs in 18 games. He was released in May.\nThough his statistical record is incomplete, it is known he hit at least 297 home runs, 448 doubles and 176 triples. Available records indicate he batted over .320 for his career, had 2,366 hits and 4,057 total bases. It is likely he had, in reality, close to 2,600 hits, over 300 home runs, around 500 doubles and 200 or more triples for his career."

        "text": "The Cape Arundel Golf Club, originally just the Arundel Golf Club, is a country club at 19 River Road in Kennebunkport, Maine. Established in 1896, it is one of the oldest golf clubs in the state. Its 18-hole course was laid out in two stages, with its original nine holes designed by Alexander H. Findley in 1900, and later redesigned and expanded by Walter Travis. The club has long been a social scene for the summer elite of the Kennebunkport area, notably including former United States President George H. W. Bush. The club was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nDescription and history.\nThe Cape Arundel Golf Club is located on the north bank of the Kennebunk River on the inland portion of Kennebunkport, abutting the neighboring town of Arundel. It is set on , between two tidal branches of the river, one of which further branches, partially dividing the property. The property is roughly bisected by the main drive, which provides access to the clubhouse, a Craftsman/Bungalow style building built in 1900 and enlarged about 1920, with an interior last remodeled in the 1980s. The building presents a single story in three directions, but has a two-story frontage overlooking the river, where its site drops off steeply.\nThe club was established in 1896 by the residents of the Cape Arundel Summer Colony, a coastal resort area of lavish summer \"cottages\" catering to the wealthy. The clubhouse was built in 1900, designed by Prosper L. Senat, and the first nine holes were formally laid out that year. In the early 1920s the club hired Walter Travis to expand the course to eighteen holes. This was accomplished in part by reversing the order of the original nine, which are located east of the access drive, and building the back nine to its west. The course is a modified links-style course, which Travis modeled on traditional Scottish seaside courses. The design involved only limited alteration to the landscape, typically the addition of mounds to the relatively flat terrain. Its greens are small, and are sometimes obscured from view from the fairway, requiring players to plan their shots with care. Play is affected both by wind conditions and the state of the tides along the river."

        "text": "The Washington–Washington State men's basketball rivalry is a college basketball rivalry between the University of Washington and Washington State University men's basketball teams, the Washington Huskies and Washington State Cougars. The series began in the 1909–10 season and has been played annually since the 1916–17 season. The teams have met 298 times, with Washington leading the series 187–111 as of 2024.\nBud Withers of \"The Seattle Times\" has questioned whether the in-state series can be legitimately called a \"rivalry\", since Washington and Washington State have never made the NCAA Tournament in the same season. However, despite lacking sustained success on the court, both schools count the other as their principal rival. WSU's head coach, Kyle Smith, stated: “I don’t put [other series] in the same category – no offense to Idaho. UW and Pac-12: that’s the real rivalry. Sorry Moscow, but that can’t be considered our rivalry. There’s nothing to gain on that one, let’s put it that way.”\nGame results.\nRankings are from the AP Poll. One Washington victory is missing from the table."

When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nRudi Koertzen of South Africa holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 209. The current active Aleem Dar is currently at 208 matches. They are followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who officiated in 200 matches. The most experienced Bangladeshi is ENamul Haque who stood in 54 ODI matches."

The team belongs to the Sun Belt Conference and plays home matches at the Jimmy Lunsford Tennis Complex. The Trojans are currently led by head coach Rolando Vargas.\nHistory.\nTroy began playing tennis during the 1980s, first playing in the NCAA's Division II and joining the Gulf South Conference. The Trojans never won a conference title while a member of the Gulf South Conference, but on a few occasions finished as the conference runner-up.\nIn 1993 during their last season in Division II, the men's team made it the NCAA Division II Championships. The Trojans wound up having a stellar season as they finished ranked #8 in the nation in the Rolex Collegiate National Rankings. That same year, Juan Garat was nominated as an ITA All-American in singles.\nTroy transitioned from Division II to Division I after the 1993 season, moving to the Mid-Continent Conference.\nWhile a member of the Mid-Continent Conference, Troy finished as the conference runner-up in 1995 and 1996, losing in the finals of the conference tournament to Western Illinois both seasons. For the 1996 season, Troy player Anshooman Aga was named the Mid-Continent's Player of the Year.\nIn 1997, Troy finally broke through to win the conference title, defeating UMKC in the conference tournament finals. Troy player Shannon Nettle was named Mid-Con Newcomer of the Year, and head coach Steve Barsby was named Mid-Con Coach of the Year for his efforts. Unfortunately, Troy did not receive a bid to play in the NCAA Tournament since at the time, the Mid-Con didn't give their tournament champion an automatic bid to the national tournament.\nThe men's tennis team won their first Sun Belt title in 2010, defeating #34 Denver 4–1 in the finals of the Sun Belt tournament. Troy would lose in the NCAA Regionals to Auburn by a score of 0–4 in the first round. They finished the regular season with a 20–5 record and ranked #51 in nation in the ITA Rankings. For his efforts, head coach Eric Hayes was named the Wilson/ITA Southern Coach of the Year, as well the Sun Belt Conference Coach of the Year.\nIn 2015 under second year head coach Scott Kidd, the men's team found their way back to the NCAA Tournament by posting a 25–6 overall record and winning the Sun Belt tournament once again, this time defeating #69 South Alabama in the finals by a score of 4–1. Their 25–6 overall record led the nation in most wins going into the 2015 postseason before dropping their First Round match against Florida State. Their 4–5 record against ranked teams helped them achieve a national ranking of #53 to finish the regular season.\nITA Final Rankings.\nSource: \nFacilities.\nTroy tennis plays their home matches at the Jimmy Lunsford Tennis Complex. Opened in 2001, the facility contains 12 outdoor hard courts with a small clubhouse/pro shop. The facility hosts various USTA junior and adult tournaments, as well as a $25,000 professional women's tennis tournament, the USTA Tennis Classic of Troy."

The team was founded in 2012 and was known as Star Horn Royal Club from 2014 to 2016 to reflect its titular sponsor, Star Horn. They were the first team to reach the finals of the League of Legends World Championship twice, doing so in 2013 and 2014. The only member of both squads was Jian \"Uzi\" Zi-Hao. Royal Club is currently the academy team of Royal Never Give Up.\nHistory.\n2013.\nRoyal Club started off the year with their participation in the G-League 2012 Season 2, finished at 3-4th place after losing against Team WE 1–4. They then attended GIGABYTE StarsWar League/Season 2 in March but got knocked out in the group stage. In June, Royal Club finished fifth in 2013 LPL Spring, went 15–13 in the group stage and did not qualify for playoffs. One day after, they participated in the NVIDIA Game Festival 2013 and placed second after losing against Team WE in the finals. In July, Royal HZ took part in StarsWar 8 tournament. They got knocked out in the semifinals, lost 0–2 to iG. At the end of July, they once again lost 0–2 to iG in the semifinals of IEM Season VIII - Shanghai and finished 3-4th. In September, Royal HZ qualified for the Season 3 China Regional Finals after finishing second in the 2013 LPL Summer/Regular Season with a 13–8 record over the season. In the Season 3 China Regional Finals, Royal HZ made an amazing comeback, went from the Loser's bracket to defeat OMG in the Grand Finals, claimed the first place and not only a spot in the Season 3 World Championship but the huge advantage of being seeded directly into the quarterfinals past the group stages.\nAt the S3 Championship, Royal Club would be a dark horse team in the quarterfinals as they were not as well known outside the Asian scene, and Worlds was their first major tournament in North America. Their first match would be against a team they were exceptionally familiar with from the Chinese league, OMG. In the first match of bracket stage, the two Chinese teams would re-enact the Chinese Regional Finals to see who would advance and who would be eliminated from the tournament. OMG had been seen as one of the strongest teams in the group stage, losing only once to the eventual champions SK Telecom T1, but Royal Club were well prepared going into the match. They defeated their Chinese compatriots in a 2–0 victory, advancing to face Europe's top seed, Fnatic. The series would lead to a back and forth heavy hitting battle between the regions, with Royal able to win the final game, 3–1. Royal Club found themselves in the ultimate spotlight in the grand finals against favored Korean team SK Telecom T1. The anticipated match led to Royal Club being overwhelmed by SK T1, losing 0–3, but taking home a very respectable second place.\nAfter the S3 Championship, Tabe and Wh1t3zZ retired while Lucky became a sub. Uzi then became team captain and briefly tried out other positions such as jungle and mid. In order to prepare for the 2014 IPL Spring, Royal Club significantly changed most of their roster, with many new faces joining the team, including the former LMQ Tian Ci top laner Yao and support Bao.\n2014.\nOn May 17, 2014, the previous Owner of Royal Club announced he was stepping down as CEO of the team and giving ownership over to Li Yande (eNO), where the team would be re-branded as Star Horn and take Royal Club's place for the LPL Summer Season.\nThe roster at the time consisted of Yao, Kmi, Lucky, Nct, Uzi, Bao, LeY, Rui, YS. May 28, LaoPi, corn, and Cola join. May 31, inSec and Zero join. December 6, ackerman joins. December 11, Uzi leaves.\nRoyal Club beat LPL team OMG 3–2 in the semi-finals. Royal Club reached the finals of the 2014 League of Legends World Championship and lost to Samsung Galaxy White 3–1.\n2015.\nStar Horn finished tenth in the 2015 LPL Spring Round Robin, eliminating them from the playoffs."

The competition was originally scheduled for August 6–15, 2021, but it was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted a postponement and subsequent rescheduling of the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Athletics banned all Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from participating at the championships. In addition, the stringent vaccination requirements for people entering the United States caused visa delays for participants and officials, with some ultimately being unable to enter the country. These issues caused the final total to stand at 179 nations (180 including the Athlete Refugee Team), the lowest number since Tokyo 1991.\nA record 29 countries won at least one gold medal during the championships. Peru, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria won their first-ever gold medals. India and Burkina Faso had their best medal performances, winning a silver, and the Philippines won a bronze. A new award was the team event trophy, which was won by the United States, which also won the most gold medals, with 13, and the most medals overall, with 33 (a record for a single edition). The event was the most-watched edition ever in US television history. More than 146,000 tickets were sold, with several evening sessions sold out.\nThere were four athletes who won two gold medals: Kimberly García in the Women's 20km Race Walk and the Women's 35km Race Walk; Michael Norman in the Men's 400m and the Men's 4x400m Relay; Sydney McLaughlin in the Women's 400m Hurdles and the Women's 4x400m Relay; and Abby Steiner in the Women's 4x100m Relay and Women's 4x400m Relay. In addition to the athletes who won two gold medals, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson both of Jamaica, earned 3 medals, 1 gold and 2 silvers in the Women's 100m (Fraser-Pryce gold; Jackson silver), the Women's 200 metres (Jackson gold; Fraser-Pryce silver) and the Women's 4x100m Relay (silver for both).\nThree world records and 13 championship records were broken. The world records were set by Sydney McLaughlin, who ran 50.68 seconds in the Women's 400m Hurdles final; Tobi Amusan, who won the Women's 100m Hurdles semi-final in 12.12 seconds; and Armand Duplantis, who reached 6.21 meters in the Men's Pole Vault final.\nHost selection and venue.\nThe selection of the host city was announced on April 16, 2015 in Beijing, China. Eugene was selected without a traditional bidding process, though Eugene did put in a bid for the 2019 World Championships, losing out to Doha.\n\"Runner's World\" magazine reported that Eugene's selection by World Athletics, then known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, was an \"unusual move\". They report the Association \"bypassed the usual bidding process,\" and that the choice of Eugene would make the 2022 event \"the first held in the United States.\" The event was the second held in North America, after Edmonton in 2001.\n\"The Guardian\" reported that the lack of bidding triggered concern in European cities that had bid to host the event.\nThey quoted Lamine Diack, IAAF president, who justified the lack of bidding with the claim the selection of Eugene to host the event, \"enables us to take advantage of a unique opportunity to host a financially successful tournament that may never arise again.\"\nDespite this, the 2022 event was not the first to lack the usual bidding process: as the 2007 World Championships were awarded to Osaka without bidding after the withdrawal of the two other candidate cities.\nVenue.\nThe championships were held at the University of Oregon Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, which has 12,650 permanent seats and a temporary capacity of 25,000. The venue had previously hosted the 2020 USA Olympic Track and Field Trials, the 2021 and 2022 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track Field Championships and the 2022 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. \nThe track, installed in 2021, was manufactured by Beynon Sports.\nThe race walking was held on a 1-km loop on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, near Autzen Stadium, and the marathon race started from the same stadium, towards Pre's Trail and going to Springfield, Oregon and back.\nEntry standards.\nWorld Athletics announced that athletes would qualify by their World Athletics Rankings position, wild card (reigning world champion or 2021 Diamond League winner) or by achieving the entry standard.\nTo qualify as a Wild Card you had to be one of the following things:\nCountries who had no male and/or no female athletes who had achieved the Entry Standard or considered as having achieved the entry standard (see above) or a qualified relay team, could enter one unqualified male athlete OR one unqualified female athlete in one event of the championships (except the road events and field events, combined events, 10,000 m and 3000 m steeplechase).\nTarget numbers.\nAt the end of the qualification period, the 2021 World Athletics Rankings were published. They were used to invite additional athletes to the World Championships where the target number of athletes had not been achieved for that event through other methods of qualification.\nThe maximum of three athletes per country in individual events was not affected by this rule. Member federations retained the right to confirm or reject athlete selections through this method.\nWhere the highest ranked athletes were from a country that already had three entrants for the event, or where member federations had rejected an entrant, the next highest ranked athlete became eligible for entry via the world rankings.\nArea Champions.\nThe following regulations shall applied for Automatic Qualification to the 2022 World Athletics Championships (not applicable for relays and marathon).\n1. The Area Champion (in each individual event to be contested at the World Championships) automatically qualifies for the World Championships, irrespective of whether his performance has reached the Entry Standard. This does not apply to 10,000 m, 3000 m Steeplechase, Combined Events, Field Events and Road Events where the entry of the athlete will be subject to the approval of the Technical Delegates\n2. The Area Champion shall be the one who has achieved the title either in 2020, 2021 or 2022\n3. The Member Federation of the Area Champion will have the ultimate authority to enter the athlete or not, based on its own domestic standard or qualification system\n4. If the Member Federation of the Area Champion enters the athlete, he will be considered as having achieved the Entry Standard\n5. If the Area Champion, for whatever reason, is not entered, his quota will not be delegated to the second placed athlete and the normal entry rules and conditions apply\n6. For those Area Championships that do not have certain events, the Area Associations can organize alternate Area-specific event Championships with conditions conforming to Area Championships Regulations. World Athletics shall be notified of such alternative Championships at least one month in advance of the events being held\nParticipating nations.\n1,972 athletes from 192 member federations were scheduled to compete at the championships, but owing to vaccination requirements and resulting visa issues the final total was reduced to 179 nations (plus the Athlete Refugee Team) and more than 1,700 athletes, the lowest number since 1991 for the former and 2005 for the latter.\nA record 29 countries won at least one gold medal during the championships. Peru, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria won their first-ever gold medals, while India and Burkina Faso had their best medal performances, with silver, and the Philippines with bronze.\nPrize money.\nThere was a world record programme where if a world record was broken the athlete who broke it would get $100,000.\nA total amount of $8,498,000 was also offered by World Athletics to finalists at Oregon 2022, of which $2 million has been ringfenced from the fines paid by the Russian Athletics Federation (for doping rules offenses).\nThe prize money is as follows:\nMedia coverage.\nThe event was streamed live in some territories on the World Athletics YouTube and Facebook channels.\nThe event was the most watched World Athletics Championships in US television history, reaching an excess of 13.7 million viewers."

The tournament was held in England from 15 October 2022 to 19 November 2022. It was originally due to be held between 23 October 2021 and 27 November 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent withdrawals of Australia and New Zealand caused the tournament to be postponed. 16 teams competed in the tournament, an increase of two from the previous two tournaments and the first to feature 16 teams since the 2000 Rugby League World Cup.\nFor the first time, the Rugby League World Cup was run alongside the women's and wheelchair tournaments with all participants being paid the same, while all 61 matches in the three tournaments were broadcast live.\nAustralia beat Samoa 30–10 in the final to win the tournament for the third successive time, extending their record number of World Cup titles to twelve.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nThe eight quarter-finalists of the previous tournament in 2017 earned automatic qualification to the 2021 tournament.

Cotton, a Macon professional golfer, and built by labor supplied by the Works Progress Administration on the site of a former airfield in east Macon, known as Miller Field. Most of the growth in golf courses between 1933 and 1942 came from New Deal initiatives, changing the face of golf in the United States. By early 1937, more than $12 million of work at about 368 courses had been completed throughout the country. Macon was able to take advantage of this program, securing $55,000 of the $70,000 needed to develop the course. The local Junior Chamber of Commerce raised much of the rest through contributions and the sale of memberships.\nThe course was completed in September 1940. The property consisted of approximately 229 acres with an 18-hole course, a driving range and a putting green. Several cobblestone benches that were installed when the course was built are still present at some tees. New structures, including a replacement clubhouse, a golf cart shed, and maintenance buildings, were built in the 1970s and are not historically significant. Holes 1 and 10 are at the site of the former Miller Field.\nIn 1961, Bowden Golf Course became the first public facility in Macon to become racially integrated. In March 2015 the course was added to the National Register of Historic Places."

It was the 42nd staging of the Masters tournament and the fifth successive time it was held at the Alexandra Palace.\nThe defending champion Shaun Murphy lost 4–6 against Mark Allen in the first round. Murphy forfeited the sixth frame of the match by missing a red on three consecutive occasions.\nThe quarter-final between Judd Trump and Neil Robertson produced six century breaks, setting a new record for the most centuries in an 11-frame match. These included the two highest breaks of the tournament, 140 from Trump and 139 from Robertson. The match was singled out for particular praise, with John Virgo calling it one of the greatest in Masters history.\nPlaying in his first major televised tournament since taking an eight-month hiatus from professional snooker, Ronnie O'Sullivan reached a record-extending 11th Masters final and won the tournament for a sixth time, equalling Stephen Hendry's record for the most Masters titles. Losing only the first frame, he defeated Barry Hawkins 10–1, the biggest winning margin since Steve Davis whitewashed Mike Hallett 9–0 in 1988, and the first time a player had won ten consecutive frames in a Masters final.\nOverview.\nThe Masters is an invitational snooker tournament first held in 1975. Organised by World Snooker, the 2016 Masters was the 42nd staging of the tournament. It was the second Triple Crown event of the 2015–16 snooker season, following the 2015 UK Championship and preceding the 2016 World Snooker Championship. Held between 10 and 17 January 2016, the event was played at the Alexandra Palace in London. Matches were played as the best-of-11 until the final, which was the best-of-19 frames played over two . The event was sponsored for the third time by online betting site Dafabet.\nParticipants.\nThe event featured the 16 players who were placed highest in the world rankings after the UK Championship in December 2021. The defending champion was Shaun Murphy, who won the 2015 Masters with a 10–2 victory over Neil Robertson in the final. Murphy was seeded first for the event as defending champion. Stuart Bingham, as world champion, was seeded second. The next six players in the world rankings were seeded and allocated fixed positions in the draw, with the remaining eight participants drawn randomly against the. Liang Wenbo, who entered the top 16 for the first time after reaching the final of the UK Champion, made his Masters debut, the only player to do so at the 2015 event.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize money of the event was unchanged at £600,000. The breakdown of prize money is shown below: \nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 10 and 13 January 2014 as the best-of-11 frames. In the opening match, the defending champion, Shaun Murphy, faced Mark Allen, semifinalist in 2011. The first two frames were shared, with of 50 for Allen and 68 for Murphy, and Allen then compiled a century break of 137. Murphy tied the match once again with a 65 break, but Allen made another , this time of 91, to move one ahead. Murphy forfeited the sixth frame under the three- rule, but he said he did not have other options rather than to risk it: \"I had to man up, take a deep breath and play the right shot. Unfortunately I got it completely wrong\". Allen then compiled a century of 104 in the next one to put himself one away from victory. Although Murphy won two frames on the trot thanks to a break of 67 and a century of 100, Allen clinched victory in the tenth frame, the only one other than the one ended after the three misses that did not feature a half-century. The 2011 champion, Ding Junhui, and Stuart Bingham, who had won the 2015 World Snooker Championship at the end of the previous season, also shared the first two frames of their first-round encounter. In the third frame, Bingham was on a maximum break attempt, but, having potted fifteen and fifteen , he missed the while beginning to the , and the break ended at 120. Bingham then sealed the first victory of his career in the Masters with a 6–4 result after close to four hours of play.\nThe following day, Stephen Maguire, four-time semi-finalist, faced Judd Trump, who had lost his first-round match in the Masters for two consecutive years. Maguire took the second frame to level the match at 1–1, but then went on to lose four on the trot. He then compiled breaks of 92, 74 and 56, and restored balance at 4–4. However, Trump won the ninth and tenth breaks to seal victory. \"My lack of form has put pressure on because I was used to going out there and expecting to play well\", said Trump, who wanted to \"give snooker four or five years of complete dedication and see what happens\". In the evening, Barry Hawkins and Joe Perry shared the first six frames, but Hawkins, aided by half-centuries of 81 and 58, won three on the trot to advance into the quarter-finals.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-final between Judd Trump and Neil Robertson produced six century breaks, setting a new record for the most centuries in an 11-frame match. These included the two highest breaks of the tournament, 140 from Trump and 139 from Robertson. The match was singled out for particular praise, with John Virgo calling it one of the greatest in Masters history.\nFinal.\nPlaying in his first major televised tournament since taking an eight-month hiatus from professional snooker, Ronnie O'Sullivan reached a record-extending 11th Masters final and won the tournament for a sixth time, equalling Stephen Hendry's record for the most Masters titles. Losing only the first frame, he defeated Barry Hawkins 10–1, the biggest winning margin since Steve Davis whitewashed Mike Hallett 9–0 in 1988, and the first time a player had won ten consecutive frames in a Masters final.\nCentury breaks.\nTotal: 26"

        "text": "\"Surfing the Web of Hate\" (original title \"Män som näthatar kvinnor\"; literally \"Men who Internet-hate women\") is a Swedish documentary by Nicke Nordmark and Hasse Johansson that was broadcast as an episode of \"Uppdrag granskning\" on Sveriges Television on 6 March 2013. The program focuses on online harassment and threats against women in Sweden.\nOne of the women is Julia, who made a post on Hennes Mauritz's Facebook page where she objected to the company having introduced a clothing line featuring Tupac Shakur, because Shakur had been convicted of sexual assault. The post received about 1800 responses which mostly centred on Julia and included threats of rape, stoning, shooting and drowning. Her full address was also posted.\nThe program featured 12 female journalists who read aloud harassment and threats they had received in online commentary or in emails. The journalists included Åsa Linderborg, Maria Sveland, Titti Schultz and Ann-Charlotte Marteus.\nA few of the men who had sent harassing and violent messages were interviewed. They were mostly young, and when asked about their comments, tended to backtrack and say it wasn't meant literally and not meant to cause harm.\nThe documentary makers wrote in a follow-up article that they had received criticism for mainly including left-wing feminist women and not addressing the problem of conservative women being objects of hate. The reporters said many of the women did not have any known political leanings and of those who had, at least one, Anna Hedemo, could not be considered a left-leaning feminist."

        "text": "The 2016 Masters Tournament was the 80th edition of the Masters Tournament, held April 7–10 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Danny Willett won his first major championship, three strokes ahead of runners-up Lee Westwood and defending champion Jordan Spieth. Spieth suffered one of the biggest collapses in Masters history. Spieth led the tournament from the first round and built a five-shot lead going to the back nine on Sunday, but lost six shots to par over the next three holes culminating in a quadruple-bogey on the 12th hole where he hit two balls into Rae's Creek. Willett shot a bogey-free 67 to overtake Spieth when the leader faltered on the back nine. Willett became the first European to win the Masters since 1999, and the first Englishman to do so since Nick Faldo in 1996.\nThis was the final Masters appearance for former champion Tom Watson.\nCourse.\nThe course was formerly a plant nursery and each hole on the course is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.\nField.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four major championships. Officially, the Masters remains an invitation event, but there is a set of qualifying criteria that determines who is included in the field. Each player is classified according to the first category by which he qualified, with other categories in which he qualified shown in parentheses.\nGolfers who qualify based solely on their performance in amateur tournaments (categories 6–10) must remain amateurs on the starting day of the tournament to be eligible to play.\n1.

Four of the amateurs (Bard, Chaplet, Cheng and Schmitz) were appearing in their first major. In addition, An Byeong-hun, Matt Fitzpatrick, and Danny Lee appeared in their first Masters as professionals. Tom Watson was playing in his final Masters event.\nPar 3 contest.\n\"Wednesday, April 6, 2016\"\nJimmy Walker won the par 3 contest with a score of 19 (−8), a new tournament record. Nine holes-in-one were made, surpassing the previous record of five set in 2002 and 2015. The players to record an ace were: Rickie Fowler, Zach Johnson, Smylie Kaufman, David Lingmerth, Gary Player, Webb Simpson, Andy Sullivan, Justin Thomas, and Walker.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 7, 2016\"\nDefending champion Jordan Spieth shot a 6-under-par 66 to take a two-shot lead over Danny Lee and Shane Lowry. His bogey-free round was his ninth consecutive Masters round of par or better. World number one Jason Day was 5-under-par through the front nine but shot 5-over-par on the back nine, including a triple-bogey on the 16th hole, to end at even-par. Ernie Els scored a record-worst nine on the first hole after taking six putts from within three feet and ended his round at 8-over-par. The course played difficult due to windy conditions and the scoring average for the field was 74.16.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 8, 2016\"\nJordan Spieth led by as many as five shots but then carded four bogeys and a double bogey and needed a 14-foot par save at the 18th to preserve a one-shot advantage over Rory McIlroy. This was Spieth's sixth consecutive round with the lead at the Masters, tying the record set by Arnold Palmer in 1960–61. Amateur Bryson DeChambeau got to within a shot of the lead but suffered a triple bogey at the last to finish at even-par. Gusting winds led to difficult scoring conditions, with only four players (Daniel Berger, Dustin Johnson, McIlroy, and Troy Merritt) shooting under par, each shooting 71. The scoring average for the round was 75.02, the highest since 2007 and only seven golfers were under par after two rounds. Tom Watson missed the cut in his 43rd and final Masters.\nAmateurs: \"DeChambeau (E)\", \"Langasque (+3)\", Bard (+9), Schmitz (+12), Cheng (+13), Chaplet (+21)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 9, 2016\"\nJordan Spieth held the lead at the Masters for the seventh consecutive round, a new tournament record, and the third straight year after 54 holes. After a double bogey at the 11th, Spieth rebounded with birdies on three of his next four holes to take a four-shot lead, but then bogeyed the 17th and carded another double bogey on the 18th to post 73 (+1) and drop the lead to one. Smylie Kaufman recorded the lowest score of the round with 69 (−3) and moved into second place. Two-time champion Bernhard Langer, at age 58 attempting to become the oldest major champion, shot a round of 70 and tied Hideki Matsuyama for third, two shots back of Spieth. Rory McIlroy entered the round a shot out of the lead but failed to make a birdie and carded 77 (+5).\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 10, 2016\"\nSummary.\nDanny Willett came back from five shots down at the start of the back nine to win his first major title. Jordan Spieth birdied his final four holes of the front-nine to open up a five-shot advantage. After bogeys at the 10th and 11th, Spieth put two balls in the water on the par-3 12th and made quadruple bogey, dropping him to a tie for fourth. Willett, meanwhile, made birdie at 13 and 14 to take the lead. Lee Westwood chipped in for eagle at the 15th to get within one of Willett, but then made bogey on 16 while Willett made birdie. Willett made par on the last two holes to post a round of 67 and five-under for the tournament.\nAfter rebounding with birdies on 13 and 15, Spieth needed to birdie two of his last three holes to tie but missed an birdie at 16 then bogeyed 17 to fall out of contention. Spieth's downfall in the final round capped one of the biggest collapses in Masters history, with many comparing it to the meltdown of Greg Norman at the 1996 Masters. Dustin Johnson also made birdie on 13 and 15 to get within two of Willett, but made double bogey on the 17th. Smylie Kaufman began the round a shot out of the lead but shot 81 (+9) and finished in 29th. For the first time in Masters history, three players (Shane Lowry, Davis Love III, and Louis Oosthuizen) made a hole-in-one on the par-3 16th.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "The 2015–16 SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's basketball team represented Southern Illinois University Edwardsville during the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Cougars, led by first year head coach Jon Harris, played their home games at the Vadalabene Center as members of the West Division of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). They finished the season 6–22, 3–13 in OVC play to finish in fifth place in the west division. They failed to qualify for the OVC tournament.\nOff-season.\nA nationwide search for a new head coach began in March, 2015, and on April 3, Edwardsville native Jon Harris, an assistant coach for the California Golden Bears was introduced as the new Cougars head coach. Harris announced the addition of assistant coaches Kent Williams and Tarrence Crump on April 24. On May 28, Charles \"Bubba\" Wells was also added to the staff.\nPreseason.\nSix players, all of whom saw major playing time, return from the 12–16 team of 2014–15. One recruit from high school signed by previous coach Lennox Forrester joined the team in addition to others recruited by new coach Harris and his staff, including three transfers from Southern Illinois junior colleges (one from local Lewis &amp; Clark), a transferring graduate student with remaining eligibility, and a transfer who will be eligible after the semester break. Missing from the mix is Donovine Stewart, last season's leader in minutes played, assists, and steals and #2 in scoring and rebounding, who graduated with a year of eligibility remaining and was said to have been contacted about transferring by Illinois, Minnesota, USC, and others, with Illinois having requested his transcripts; Stewart eventually transferred to Portland State but sat out the PSU @ SIUE game on December 12.\nSeason.\nThe 2015–16 season will begin in mid-November, 2015.\nAlthough the final schedule was not released until August 2, SIUE's non-conference opponents for the upcoming campaign were announced in May. The Cougars will host Saint Louis (11–21 in 2014-15), Portland State (15–14), Campbell (10–22), and Grand Canyon (17–15) at the Vadalabene Center. They will take road trips to play at USC (12–20), Butler (23–11), Northwestern (15–17), SIU Carbondale (12–21), Milwaukee (14–16), and IPFW (16–15).\nMost games will be streamed online.

        "text": "Swimming competitions at the 2015 SEA Games was held at the OCBC Aquatic Centre in the Singapore Sports Hub in Kallang, Singapore from 6 to 11 June 2015. Built only a year earlier, the venue is hosting the SEA Games for the first time. It was used to host the second Southeast Asian Swimming Championships in 2014 as a test bed for the organisers, with the 2015 Southeast Asian Games volunteers hired to also volunteer in the 2014 Swimming Championships to help in the familiarisation of the new venue.\nWith swimming being a traditional gold mine for Singapore having been the country's strongest sport, there were high expectations for the squad to deliver another record haul of medals, especially given that Singapore is the host country. Two male athletes in particular, namely Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen were expected to shoulder the responsibility for the hosts, being entered in nine and 12 events respectively. Other athletes expected to shine include Quah Ting Wen, Tao Li and Danny Yeo.\nThis Aquatics discipline featured 38 long course events: 19 for males and 19 for females. This restores six events which were dropped by the previous host, Myanmar in the 2013 edition.\nIndonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were expecting to present the most resistance to Singapore's ambitions. In particular, Nguyễn Thị Ánh Viên from Vietnam contested strongly especially in 12 events.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 129 athletes from nine nations competed in swimming at the 2015 SEA Games:\nEvents.\nIn most editions of the games, the swimming programme follows closely with the Olympics swimming programme, offering 32 pool events except the two 10 km open-water marathons. However, in 2011, six more non-Olympic events, namely the shorter 50 metre events for backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly were included. Although these were again dropped in 2013, Singapore re-introduced the 38-event programme to capitalise on its strength in swimming.\nThe following events were contested (all pool events were long course, and distances are in metres unless stated):\nSchedule.\nThe following is the competition schedule for the swimming competitions. As with previous editions of the games, the swimming programme schedule occurs in two segments, with the heats, if any, being conducted in the morning, followed by the final events during the evening sessions:\nM = Morning session, E = Evening session\nResults.\nSingapore produced its best performance in swimming in the SEA Games, taking more than half of the total gold medals offered. Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen won ten of these medals and broke nine games records, with Schooling winning all of his events and Quah winning four. Quah and Schooling also combined with their relay teams to games record-breaking wins in all three relays. The women's individual events were dominated by Nguyễn Thị Ánh Viên of Vietnam, who won eight gold medals. The Singaporean women combined to win seven individual events as well as all three relays, breaking the games record in the 4x100 medley."

        "title": "Basketball in Slovenia",
        "text": "Basketball in Slovenia is governed by the Basketball Federation of Slovenia (\"Košarkarska zveza Slovenije\"). Slovenia has participated in international basketball as an independent nation since 1991, when the country gained independence from SFR Yugoslavia.\nThe highest level of Slovenian basketball is the Premier A Slovenian Basketball League. The Slovenia national basketball team has qualified for 13 Eurobaskets, including the gold medal in 2017 and a fourth-place finish in 2009, and three FIBA World Cups, in 2006, 2010, and 2014.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBefore basketball was introduced, Slovenians played korball, which is similar to netball and basketball. As early as 1914, basketball was being played in Maribor. In 1921, Ciril Hočevar, a physical education teacher and member of the Sokol Maribor society, brought his basketball knowledge to the country. Although in some parts of Yugoslavia basketball was played from the 1920s onwards, it came to the territories that are today part of Slovenia only during the Second World War. In 1936, Professor Angela Bahovec introudced the sport to girls after learning the sport in England. The first club was founded in Ljubljana as a basketball section of ŽŠK Hermes in 1943, when the city was under Italian administration. After the war, basketball was promoted mostly by students who came from the Belgrade Sports Institute and new clubs were soon founded in Ljubljana, Maribor, Murska Sobota, Celje and Lendava. The first postwar public match was played in February 1946 and the first Championship was held later that year, with Svoboda winning the first title. The Slovenian champion had the opportunity of competing for the Yugoslav Championship in the final tournament until 1949, when with the formation of the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia an annual league called the federal league was established. It was joined by two best Slovenian teams Enotnost and Železničar, who later both played a major role in Yugoslav basketball. Enotnost, renamed Olimpija, won the Yugoslav league six times, while Železničar won one cup title.\nSuccesses with Yugoslavia.\nOn 15 January 1950 the Basketball Federation of Slovenia was founded as a section of the Yugoslav federation and home and away round-robin Republic league matches were established as a second or third tier of Yugoslav basketball. The Republic champion had the opportunity of promotion to the Yugoslav leagues and apart from Olimpija and Železničar also Slovan, ŽKK Maribor, Lesonit and Maribor 66 managed to play in the Yugoslav First Federal Basketball League. In 1950 Mirko Amon (Železničar), best scorer of Yugoslav League that season, became the first Slovenian player in Yugoslavia national basketball team, later to be followed by many others. Slovenian players with most appearances for the national team were Ivo Daneu, Peter Vilfan, Jure Zdovc, Boris Kristančič and Aljoša Žorga. Slovenian players had an important role when Yugoslavia won the 1970 FIBA World Cup in Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana, while they were also members of 1978 and 1990 World Championships' winning teams. Apart from men, women's basketball was also popular with Iskra Delta Ježica being regular in Yugoslav women's league and many players becoming members of women's national team, the team which won four silver medals at the FIBA Women's EuroBasket tournament from 1968 until 1991.\nSeparation from Yugoslavia and independent successes.\nAfter the Independence of Slovenia in 1991, national League and Cup competitions were formed on the basis of Old Republic structures. Slovenia became official members of FIBA on 10 January 1992 and the Slovenia national basketball team played their first official match against Croatia in May of that year. In 2017, Slovenia won that year's Eurobasket, with Goran Dragić as the tournament’s MVP. In 2023, they tied their best finish at a FIBA World Cup with 7th, which they also finished with in the 2014 edition.\nMeanwhile, the women's national team made its debut in 1993. In 2023, Slovenia co-hosted that year's Eurobasket Women alongside Israel.\nNational teams.\nSenior\nYouth"
